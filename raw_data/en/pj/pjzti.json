Through it all, Goodyear continues to be guided by our commitment to quality, integrity and sustainability. These values come to life in our 72,000 associates around the world, who have persevered through unprecedented crises, continued serving our customers and maintained their dedication to each other and our communities. Over the past 12 months, Goodyear made significant progress in a variety of areas that we believe are critical to our long-term vitality. One of those areas is sustainability, which we define as responsibly balancing environmental, societal and financial demands without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. While we have always considered sustainability as an essential part of our business strategy rather than simply an add-on, its inclusion in our refreshed Strategy Roadmap makes our commitment clear and definitive for all our stakeholders and illustrates that sustainability is an integral part of our culture. Last year, Goodyear also established several long-term sustainability goals, including net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, a commitment to all renewable energy in our facilities by 2040 and to be known as having the safest operations in the world. Additionally, we are making progress on previously stated goals of complete petroleum oil replacement in our products by 2040, and a tire made of 100% sustainable materials by 2030. As evidence of our commitment to these goals, the talented team of scientists and engineers featured on the report cover developed a demonstration tire in 2021 with 70% sustainable material content. We're proud of the progress they and other associates are making toward our sustainability goals. While we can make progress alone, we've learned throughout our history that we can go so much further by building relationships with companies that share our passion for technology-driven solutions for a world of new mobility. As fleets of shared, electric and autonomous vehicles grow in use, Goodyear will be at the forefront of products and services to keep the world moving.One example of this is the introduction of Goodyear SightLine, a suite of technologies \u2014including intelligent tires\u2014that enables fleets to identify and address problems in real time. SightLine led to our collaboration with Gatik, the first autonomous middle-mile logistics provider in North America. We look forward to more collaborations like this to help shape a new, more sustainable mobility ecosystem. In this Corporate Responsibility Report, we reflect on the progress we have made along our sustainability journey. You will read about Goodyear's climate goals, our support of human rights and our corporate responsibility ambitions. However, we also look ahead to the future. We have accepted the high expectations of our brand and our products, including those from our customers who are looking to us to help them meet their sustainability goals and to work with them to shape the mobility revolution. We embrace the opportunities those expectations present and remain committed to keeping the world moving and to building a better future that enables Goodyear associates to deliver high-quality products and solutions for today and tomorrow. RICHARD J. KRAMER Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTINDEX DATA 4 A MESSAGE FROM OUR CHIEF SUSTAINABILITY OFFICER Businesses today are faced with helping to solve some of the most consequential challenges we've ever seen. While the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a framework for understanding the scope of the challenges, businesses must internalize how to leverage their business model to enable sustainable environmental and social outcomes. I'm very excited about the progress Goodyear has made to integrate sustainability, set bold ambitions and chart a course toward a more sustainable business model. Our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report highlights the work of our global associates as we develop strategies for responding to the challenges of today and tomorrow. Throughout all our work, the level of engagement across our organization has been inspiring. Our associates tell us sustainability is important in their personal lives. They also believe it's a key driver for Goodyear's success. From climate change to equality and inclusion to sustainable production and consumption, our associates know these challenges will not be solved by doing business as usual. All companies around the world, including Goodyear, continue to face the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While supply chain disruptions are a visible example of the disruption caused by COVID, other effects are often harder to see. Since the pandemic began, we have paid special attention to its effect on our people. Such conditions as lockdowns, restricted movement, alternative working conditions, absenteeism because of illness, and others have had an impact on the mental and physical wellness of our associates. We believe that an essential part of our corporate responsibility is caring for our people, providing them the support they need to maintain good health. While this is clearly the right thing to do, it also reflects our commitment to viewing our strategy through the increasingly important lens of environmental, social and governance (ESG) obligations. While we continue to build our functional capacity and capability to deliver outstanding performance across these areas, we elevated our focus on social issues, including human rights, in 2021. Through our newly launched Human Rights Steering Committee, we are developing an enhanced human rights strategy that aligns with the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and includes action in policy and scope, implementation and engagement. Our work to improve in all ESG areas is best described by the four pillars of our Goodyear Better Future framework\u2014Sustainable Sourcing, Responsible Operations, Advanced Mobility and Inspiring Culture. Built on that foundation are our plans for the future, whether anticipating challenges, taking advantage of opportunities or increasing our expectations of ourselves as a corporate citizen. Within this report, you will find evidence of how each of these pillars comes to life in everything we do. We believe you'll also see how the pillars are connected to each other, to our business model and to our refreshed Strategy Roadmap. Additionally, this report reflects the beginning of a new chapter in Goodyear's history with the acquisition of Cooper Tire. Since the acquisition did not close until June 2021, we won't fully integrate Cooper performance into this report until our 2022 edition. However, you'll read about some of Cooper's employees and their activities, all of which fit perfectly within Goodyear's strategy. Until then, we are focused on blending our strengths, increasing our agility and improving our efficiency as one company. The foundation of Goodyear's corporate responsibility gives us the strength to act responsibly today while providing a vantage point to anticipate changes ahead. While we are building a more sustainable business enabling Goodyear to win today and tomorrow, the real winners will be those impacted by our outcomes\u2014our associates win, the environment wins and our communities win. ELLIS A.

Advanced forms of mobility, such as electric vehicles, ride sharing and fleets, autonomous vehicles, and connected vehicles, have the potential to reduce vehicle emissions and energy use. Companies in the transportation sector are setting ambitious climate goals that require the support of the entire supply chain to achieve. The move to a low carbon economy creates growth opportunities within the tire industry that Goodyear is well positioned to leverage through its continued innovation. Goodyear has a proven track record of producing tires for electric and autonomous vehicles, developing tires and rubber compounds that contribute to reduced emissions by lowering rolling resistance and reducing tire weight, and providing fleet solution services that promote fuel efficiency. Climate change poses risks that could adversely impact Goodyear's operations, including risks related to our plans to continue to develop and supply the types of products, services and technologies demanded by consumers. Such risks could also include an increase in severe weather events that could temporarily disrupt Goodyear's operations or supply chain or the operations of Goodyear's customers, and the cost of compliance associated with increased climate-related regulations globally. That's why we launched our CEO-sponsored climate strategy development in 2021, led by a cross-functional operating committee and supported by external climate expertise. This collaborative approach ensures the Company understands our most significant climate impacts and the key risks and opportunities our business faces. In December 2021, we announced our climate ambition, which includes our goal to reach net-zero Scope 1, 2 and certain direct Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050, aligned with the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and its new Net-Zero Standard. We also announced our commitment to achieve near-term science-based targets by 2030, including reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 46% and certain direct Scope 3 emissions by 28%, as compared to 2019.In the next phase of our climate strategy work, Goodyear will conduct a scenario analysis to evaluate the resilience of Goodyear's business model in the context of different climate scenarios and evaluate adaptation and mitigation strategies. Goodyear will also evaluate additional carbon reduction activities and will deliver a comprehensive roadmap, including an action plan to achieve our climate ambition. In 2022, Goodyear will expand our climate reporting to align with the recommendations and supplementary guidance from the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Goodyear's TCFD report was published in March 2022 and will be updated later in 2022 with the results of the extensive climate analysis work described on this page. Moving forward, we will work to integrate the climate roadmap activities across the business, and we will integrate the ongoing identification and analysis of climate-related risks into risk management and other business processes. As the graphic on the next page shows, the biggest impact through the tire life cycle is in the product use phase. One way that Goodyear can influence this is by helping to increase consumers' fuel efficiency via improved rolling resistance products. Additionally, we work to improve our impacts throughout all life cycle phases through various strategies. Click on each strategy to learn more about our approach and commitments. Goodyear utilizes Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate products quantitatively through the entire life of the product\u2014from the sourcing of raw materials all the way to the end of the product's life. Each LCA is performed using internationally recognized ISO frameworks that help provide a full picture of product impacts as well as opportunities for improvement that can be used in product development. Goodyear has also collaborated with the Tire Industry Project (TIP) to develop Product Category Rules (PCRs) for evaluating impacts from tires.2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTINDEX DATA 10 1 Dark shades represent the contribution to global warming potential.

For example, Goodyear's Human Rights policy is incorporated in our Business Conduct Manual , Zero Tolerance Policy , Natural Rubber Procurement Policy and the Supplier Code of Conduct . Purchasing associates globally are provided annual training on Human Rights. Reporting up through the Better Future governance structure , the recently launched Human Rights Steering Committee is updating Goodyear's human rights strategy. This strategy aligns with the U.N. Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and includes active workstreams in policy and scope, implementation, engagement and education. We are also developing additional education and communications resources for all our leaders and associates to understand and apply human rights standards in their areas of responsibility. The scope of this strategy includes evaluating potential risks and opportunities to reduce risk in Goodyear's operations and supply chain, represented by the Better Future Framework pillars of Sustainable Sourcing, Responsible Operations, Advanced Mobility, and Inspiring Culture. We plan to provide an update on the Human Rights Steering Committee's efforts in future reports.2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTINDEX DATA 11 CLIMATE AND NATURAL RESOURCES As part of our Goodyear Better Future framework, Goodyear is committed to responsible operations, which includes understanding the potential impacts our operations may have on climate and natural resources, such as forests, land and water. When it comes to climate impacts, as described in the Climate Change section, most of Goodyear's impact lies within the product use and raw materials phases. We have set science-based climate goals, are creating a climate strategy and are committed to addressing Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions up and down our value chain. Refer to the Climate Change section and noted strategies. While Goodyear does not own any rubber tree plantations, we have taken actions as a purchaser of natural rubber, as noted in the Sustainable Sourcing section and in our Natural Rubber Procurement Policy . This includes supporting the livelihoods of smallholders while promoting responsible acquisition and management of land that is free from deforestation. Goodyear is an active member of the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR) where industry and other platform members throughout the value chain are collaborating under the guidance of the GPSNR Policy Framework. Goodyear is also an active member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development's (WBCSD's) Tire Industry Project (TIP), which has many working groups, including tire and road wear particles (TRWP) and end-of-life tires (ELT). To read more about our involvement and this important work, review the Tire Industry Project (TIP) section of this report.

Together, TIP member companies, representing approximately 65% of the world's tire manufacturing capacity, work to anticipate, identify, analyze and address the potential human health and environmental impacts associated with tire development, use and management throughout the tire's lifecycle. TIP's focus areas include materials and chemicals, tire and road wear particles (TRWP), end-of-life tire management, and tools and frameworks. TIP member CEOs meet biennially to review project progress and approve a two-year work plan. The work plan is reviewed by an assurance group of independent scientists who provide guidance on the scientific relevance and robustness of planned work. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, TIP's agenda remained a priority throughout 2021. Some of TIP's major accomplishments from the year include: Tire and Road Wear Particles (TRWP) - TIP has been studying the potential impacts of TRWP on human health and the environment since 2005. The early research launched by TIP has been groundbreaking in terms of identification, quantification and risk assessment of TRWP in different environmental compartments, including air, soil, and sediments through the development of new sample collection methods and analytical techniques. As a result of this research TIP has published 15 peer-reviewed scientific studies on TRWP . The topic of TRWP has been receiving increasing attention over the past several years from a large number of stakeholders, including international organizations, NGOs, governments and academic research institutions. As this group of stakeholders continues to expand, in addition to TIP, Goodyear participates as a member of regional tire trade associations (RTTAs), including the European Tyre and Rubber Manufacturers' Association (ETRMA) and the U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association (USTMA) . The work with our regional associations involves advocacy and engaging with stakeholders to share tire industry research and expertise about TRWP, tires and tire-related materials. In 2021, TIP continued commissioned research on TRWP conducted by independent research firms and consultants and guided by an advisory panel of academic experts. Recent research from TIP includes: Analytical Method Development and Refinement TRWP Aging Study TRWP Ecotoxicity Study TRWP Mass Balance Modeling TRWP Field Sampling Additionally in 2021, TIP launched a new website to share all TIP TRWP research and provide an accessible multimedia introduction to the topic. Beyond our engagement on TRWP with TIP and the RTTAs, Goodyear also takes into consideration impacts of TRWP as they relate to the sustainability of our products. To learn more about our efforts on product sustainability see Sustainable Materials and Sourcing. End-of-Life Tires (ELT) - In 2021, TIP published End-of-Life (ELT) Management Toolkit , a guide to proven management systems to maximize collection and recycling of ELT in countries that do not have efficient programs in place. The toolkit outlines key steps for establishing and enhancing ELT management systems along with identifying the social, economic and environmental benefits of each system. In 2021, TIP also organized stakeholder dialogues in Europe, the United States and China with regional participants from across the ELT value chain. The objectives were to promote and strengthen communication of the stakeholders; facilitate discussion and identify solutions for improved local-level ELT management; and maximize knowledge on ELT management along with identifying new research opportunities. TIP plans to release a report in 2022 describing the outcomes and lessons learned from these meetings. 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTINDEX DATA 15 Environmental Impacts - TIP published its 2021 report on environmental key performance indicators (KPIs) for tire manufacturing, noting overall maintained or improved performance at TIP member locations. The selected KPIs include energy use, CO2 emissions, water use and ISO 14001 certification at member company tire manufacturing operations. In 2021, common methodology was developed among TIP members in order to include waste data as a fifth environmental KPI that will be included for the first time in the 2022 report. Additional work will be conducted to identify and integrate SDG-related KPIs to report progress highlighted in the Sustainability Driven: Accelerating Impact with the Tire Sector SDG Roadmap , available here . GLOBAL PLATFORM FOR SUSTAINABLE NATURAL RUBBER (GPSNR) TIP members and other stakeholders, including automakers, rubber producers, other end users, and civil society, launched the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber (GPSNR) in 2018 to move the natural rubber supply chain toward natural rubber sustainability. In addition to being a GPSNR founding member, Goodyear continues to be an active GPSNR member, including being voted to the two-year seat on the Executive Committee representing the tiremaker category. Goodyear also continues to co-chair the Strategy & Objectives Working Group that completed the Environmental Risk Study and development of GPSNR's Theory of Change. Goodyear prioritizes engagement directly within GPSNR Working Groups or indirectly as necessary, as GPSNR facilitates the natural rubber industry's move towards a more sustainable supply chain. In 2021, GPSNR approved reporting requirements, under which members in the natural rubber value chain will report on their policy implementation progress, which Goodyear will complete in 2022. COALITION FOR REIMAGINED MOBILITY (CRM) The Coalition for Reimagined Mobility (CRM) brings together industry, government and academic leaders to shape policy for more equitable and sustainable solutions that leverage technology to improve the movement of people and goods around the world. CRM conducts research and advocacy to advance platforms that prioritize people while ensuring the wellbeing and security of the planet.

At Goodyear, sustainable sourcing is our approach to responsibly managing the materials we use for our operations and products. That includes our efforts to source sustainable natural rubber, increase our sustainable material usage, pursue raw material traceability, remove materials of concern and proactively manage supply chain ESG risks. TOPIC IMPORTANCE Sustainable Materials and SourcingGoodyear is actively working toward selecting more sustainable materials that deliver the same or enhanced product quality and performance, and selecting suppliers who uphold fair working conditions, use sustainable harvesting practices, and share our values. Supply Chain ManagementAs part of Goodyear's commitment to responsible sourcing, supply chain management remains a high priority for Goodyear. SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS AND SOURCING Prior to sourcing materials, Goodyear's Product Stewardship team completes supplier reviews that include gathering safety data sheets (SDS) and ensuring the materials comply with all applicable global chemical inventories and regulatory standards, including the European Union's Regulation (EC) No. 1907/2006 concerning Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) and the U.S.' Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) . Goodyear's Global Material Science team approves material specifications. In addition, through their management of change processes, our manufacturing facilities conduct environmental, health and safety (EHS) checks to help ensure safe use and compliance. Goodyear's Procurement and Technology teams manage the governance of materials and sourcing. SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS PERFORMANCE Given that product quality, safety and customer satisfaction are our ultimate goals, our Procurement and Technology teams actively seek sustainable material options that deliver product performance while meeting our high standards of quality and safety and avoiding increasing supply or production costs. To advance Goodyear's sustainable material use, our Technology teams work to incorporate new innovations and use and/or investigate alternative raw materials that are more sustainable, such as innovative new rubber and soybean oil. As an example, we have announced sustainability goals around the increased use of soybean oil in our products, including the goal to increase the use of soybean oil in place of petroleum-based oil by 25% by the end of 2019. We met, and far exceeded, this goal by increasing our soybean oil use by 90% in 2019, 73% in 2020, and 13% in 2021. When considering our total sustainable oil usage in place of petroleum-based oils, our 2021 increase was 27%. Our long-term goal of full petroleum oil replacement in our products by 2040 remains in place. These goals are supported by the established versatility of the technology, along with the demonstrated performance and processing advantages. To learn more about our soybean oil tread compound, see Advanced Mobility . In 2020, Goodyear set a goal to create a tire made 100% from sustainable materials by 2030. Our scientists and engineers made great progress toward that goal by developing a 70% sustainable-material tire. The demonstration tire includes 13 featured ingredients, including three different carbon blacks produced from methane, carbon dioxide, and plant-based oil; soybean oil; rice husk ash silica; and polyester recycled from plastic bottles and other plastic waste. Another example is our use of bio-based replacements for silica. Goodyear is now using a silica product made from residual rice husk ash - a byproduct of rice processing. Rice husk ash (RHA) silica can help deliver performance similar to traditional sand-based silica yet is more environmentally friendly and helps reduce waste going to landfill. Over the past several years, we have introduced the use of RHA silica in several of our global manufacturing facilities. We have been working closely with our suppliers to explore further expanding the use of RHA silica and set a goal to double our use by 2021 when compared to 2018 use. We made significant progress toward that goal in 2019 as our usage increased by 74%. However, COVID-19-related effects on production impacted our 2020 use of RHA silica, resulting in an increase of 47% compared to 2018 use. Impacts related to our RHA silica suppliers' footprint limited our ability to source the expected RHA silica volume in 2021. For 2022, Goodyear has successfully secured RHA silica volumes that place us beyond our 2021 commitment. Goodyear was recognized by FEDIL, the Luxembourgish multisectoral business federation, with its 2021 Environmental Award in the category \"Process\" for its innovative and environmentally friendly traction resin. This special resin replaces petroleum-based resins and is used in the manufacture of Goodyear's passenger and commercial ultra-high-performance tires such as the Eagle F1 Asymmetric 5 and Eagle F1 SuperSport (shown at right). SUSTAINABLE SOURCING20 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTSUSTAINABLE SOURCING PERFORMANCE At Goodyear, we strive to make an impact through our choice of the materials we use. We are committed to managing sourcing in a way that helps reduce environmental and social impacts and improve our global risk management. To that end, we are working to expand Goodyear's requirements to include sustainable sourcing guidelines. In September 2021, we updated our Supplier Code of Conduct to underscore our expectations of suppliers. The changes to the Supplier Code of Conduct include expanded and/or clarified requirements relating to human rights, environmental sustainability, health and safety, and business ethics, as well as our requirements relating to competition law compliance, conflicts of interest and privacy, among other topics. Goodyear's sourcing includes direct materials such as: natural and synthetic rubber; fillers; pigments; chemicals and oils; semi-finished goods such as bead wire, steel cord and fabrics; and indirect items such as services, equipment, maintenance, transportation, energy, and utilities. NATURAL RUBBER More than 99% of the world's natural rubber is made from latex derived from rubber trees, which is primarily sourced from Southeast Asia. The tire industry uses approximately 70% of the world's natural rubber, and demand for natural rubber is growing. This raises various social, environmental and economic concerns and opportunities associated with the production of this important commodity. Social and agricultural practices in natural rubber production can vary greatly and can have significant impacts on the livelihood and rights of local people, as well as local ecosystems through potential habitat conversions and reduction of species from deforestation. Goodyear does not own any rubber tree plantations, but we have taken actions as a purchaser of natural rubber. In October 2021, we released an enhanced version of our Natural Rubber Procurement Policy to align with the Global Platform for Sustainable Natural Rubber's (GPSNR) Policy Framework . This update signals our strong natural rubber supply chain commitments across all aspects of sustainability. Our Natural Rubber Procurement Policy applies to Goodyear and our affiliates, including Cooper. The key policy principles guiding Goodyear's actions include: Support and protect the rights of workers (including contract, temporary, and migrant workers), landowners and local people; Promote responsible acquisition and management of land that is free from deforestation and land grabbing; Promote practices that lead to the ability to trace natural rubber through the entire supply chain; Promote the use of responsible and sustainable production techniques; Promote the best available growing and harvesting techniques; Support the livelihoods of smallholders; and Regularly audit and work with our supply chain on policy compliance. Additionally, Goodyear is a founding member of the TIP , a CEO-led initiative with 10 of the world's major tire companies. Through TIP, Goodyear worked with other stakeholders, including automakers, rubber producers, other end users, and civil society, to move the natural rubber supply chain toward natural rubber sustainability. TIP members and others launched the GPSNR in 2018. In addition to being a GPSNR founding member, Goodyear continues to be an active GPSNR member, including being voted to the two-year seat on the Executive Committee representing the tiremaker category. Goodyear also continues to co-chair the Strategy & Objectives Working Group that completed the Environmental Risk Study and development of GPSNR's Theory of Change. Goodyear prioritizes engagement directly within GPSNR Working Groups or indirectly as necessary, as GPSNR facilitates the natural rubber industry's move towards a more sustainable supply chain. In 2021, GPSNR approved reporting requirements, under which members in the natural rubber value chain will report on their policy implementation progress, which Goodyear will complete in 2022. Materials by percentage for \"typical\" tires (Source: USTMA ).SUSTAINABLE SOURCING21 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTSUPPORT FOR NATURAL RUBBER FARMERS AND COMMUNITIES Through our Natural Rubber Procurement Policy , we are committed to supporting socially responsible projects in the communities that support our supply chain. In 2021, Goodyear, as a Gold Donor, contributed funding to kickstart GPSNR's capacity building project to help incentivize smallholders and industrial plantations to under - take sustainable practices. Initiatives related to the project are expected to pilot in Thailand, Indonesia and Ivory Coast beginning in 2022 and may include: Distribution of certified (re)planting material by establishing budwood gardens, Disease-fighting training, Sharing of good agricultural practices by setting up demonstration farms and training centers, Development of a rubberwood market through studies and workshops, Establishment of regional tapper co-operatives to boost labor availability, and Support for income diversification through agroforestry research and training. We expect that GPSNR's capacity-building project will require ongoing funding to enable the long-term success and expansion of the programs. As an active member of GPSNR with representation in the Capacity Building Working Group, Goodyear believes it is important to support GPSNR in its efforts to identify and address capacity building gaps on the ground within the natural rubber supply chain. CONFLICT MINERALS Goodyear does not directly purchase conflict minerals for use in our manufacturing processes; however, some of our tier 1 suppliers incorporate these minerals into components that we purchase from them, such as bead wire. Goodyear conducts due diligence on our supply chain to assess our exposure to risk due to conflict minerals. Our Supplier Code of Conduct requires that suppliers source minerals, derivatives of minerals and other raw materials in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and in a manner that respects human rights, and that they avoid directly or indirectly financing or benefiting armed groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and/ or its adjoining countries. In addition, under the Code, suppliers are required, from time to time, (i) to certify that all materials and products supplied to Goodyear do not contain tantalum, tin, tungsten, gold or cobalt or (ii) if they do contain those elements, to cooperate with Goodyear to conduct appropriate due diligence, including determin - ing the country of origin and the source (including the applicable smelter) and chain of custody of those elements. To ensure compliance with our expectations, we also require any supplier with products containing tantalum, tin, tungsten, gold or cobalt to fill out a Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) twice a year. We require suppliers to disclose the smelters for those products, and we are a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative's (RMI) Conflict- Free Smelter Program , an industry initiative that audits smelters' due diligence activities. View our 2021 Conflict Minerals report here . SOYBEAN OIL As we continue to increase our use of soybean oil as a replacement for petroleum products, we identified a need to formalize our standards for the responsible procure - ment of soybean oil. Our Soybean Oil Procurement Policy was published in March 2021. Building upon our Business Conduct Manual and Supplier Code of Conduct, we believe the policy can help guide processors, farmers and all other members of the supply chain to establish practices and make sound environmental and social decisions related to the growing, harvesting and processing of soybeans. SUSTAINABLE SOURCING22 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTSUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT Goodyear's Chief Procurement Officer leads our Procurement team to manage Goodyear's sourcing for the materials and services we use globally. Together with other Goodyear teams, our Procurement team oversees and implements policies, programs, and supplier assessments and audits. The team also provides associate training on topics such as human trafficking, forced and child labor, anti-corruption, compliance, and strategic sourcing processes. First-year Procurement associates receive more than 40 hours of procurement-specific training, and all team members receive an annual refresher training. Training includes content that helps associates identify potential issues and provides us with the skills and resources to respond appropriately. We require our suppliers to comply with Goodyear's Supplier Code of Conduct or have their own equally substantial code of conduct, and we may deny or terminate a business relationship should a supplier not do so. Topics covered in the Supplier Code of Conduct include child labor and other working condition regulations, environmental practices and anti-corruption. We discuss the remaining policies listed above in more detail in Human Rights and Natural Rubber . SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT POLICIESTHOSE REQUIRED TO COMPLY Business Conduct Manual All associates Supplier Code of Conduct All suppliers Global Human Rights Policy All Goodyear associates and suppliers Natural Rubber Procurement PolicyAll participants within the natural rubber supply chain (e.g., smallholders, plantations, intermediate dealers/ consolidators, processors, and trading companies) Soybean Oil Procurement PolicyAll participants within the soybean oil supply chainGoodyear's Business Continuity and Procurement teams annually conduct an all-category and commodity risk assessment that identifies top raw material supplier risks across our global supply chain. This annual survey considers a wide range of factors, including: procurement spend and volume; supply or supplier alternatives; geographic spend; geopolitical concerns; and emerging laws and regulations. Goodyear reserves the right to request information or access to suppliers' facilities at any time to confirm compliance, including and especially as it relates to human trafficking and modern slavery. In the event of violations, our Procurement team pursues appropriate responses, which may include working with suppliers to create corrective action plans or, in appropriate cases, terminating the relationship. We include audit and corrective action results in our sourcing strategy discussions. Our existing screening process includes an ESG survey and requires raw material suppliers - new or existing - to respond to the survey or provide answers to a similar assessment. In 2021, we completed an assessment for 95% of our raw material spend. Through this process, covered suppliers are required to provide information on policies and programs pertaining to, but not limited to: human rights; employee training; environmental, health and safety; chemical management; hazardous material controls; and waste management. These survey results help position us to take effective action as we determine supply chain opportunities and strategies, as well as to create and implement action and improvement plans when appropriate. In 2022, we plan to continue to work with suppliers as needed to develop agreed-upon improvement plans as well as introduce a pilot program for strategic indirect suppliers to be included in our ESG assessment process. Goodyear is also exploring processes and technology to enhance supply chain traceability, tracking materials along development paths from agricultural production to storage, distribution, processing, manufacturing and more. In 2020, Goodyear planned to pilot a new system utilizing smartphone technology to assist in field-based data capture with smallholders. The pilot has been put on hold due to concerns related to COVID-19, including travel restrictions for the safety of our employees as well as our suppliers' employees, but is expected to resume when conditions improve. In this pilot, we hope to work toward rolling out this technology on a broader scale within our natural rubber and other raw material supply chains.SUSTAINABLE SOURCING23 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTHUMAN RIGHTS Goodyear's Global Human Rights Policy illustrates that we are fully committed to maintaining an inclusive workplace and value chain that is free of harassment based on a person's gender, race, age, religion, disability, ancestry, national origin, sexual orientation, or other characteristics protected by applicable law. We prohibit all forms of compulsory, indentured, or slave labor as well as human trafficking, and this extends beyond our operations to include suppliers and other third parties. Goodyear's raw material supplier assessments include questions pertaining to supplier human rights policies and violations. As noted above, our Supplier Code of Conduct addresses important topics including human rights, child labor and other working condition regulations, environmental practices and anti-corruption. All suppliers are expected to abide by Goodyear's Supplier Code of Conduct or have their own equally substantial code of conduct. In line with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) reporting recommendations, we reviewed the material contracts listed as part of our annual public financial reporting for those initiating strategic equity acquisitions or capital projects with a view to assessing human rights content in any applicable agreements. For the 2021 reporting period, our acquisition of Cooper fell into this category and included a clause addressing our human rights expectations. With a comprehensive approach to ethics and compliance measures, we work to ensure our own operations do not allow or pose significant risk for either child or forced labor. In accordance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 , Goodyear takes measures to prevent and eliminate forced labor in our direct supply chain, such as the risk-based assessments, supplier audits and procurement trainings discussed above. To develop the baseline for our human trafficking risk assessments, we used the 2010 U.S. Department of Labor's (DoL) List of Goods Produced by Child or Forced Labor that categorizes goods by country. Within the tire industry, the production of natural rubber, particularly in Southeast Asia, poses the highest risk of child or forced labor. Goodyear audits all of our natural rubber suppliers every two years to ensure our operations are not supporting child or forced labor. In 2020 and 2021, we conducted onsite or virtual audits at 100% of our supply. Please see our Natural Rubber Procurement Policy for more information.One hundred percent of Goodyear Procurement associates take an annual online training course on human rights issues. Beyond raising awareness about slavery and human trafficking, such as forced labor and child labor, the course also sets expectations for reporting any known or suspected violations. Goodyear's Integrity Hotline , available to both associates and suppliers, enables reporting of potential human rights issues, including anonymously (where permitted by law). This hotline is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week from anywhere in the world via toll-free telephone or website. PERFORMANCE Our ongoing efforts to strengthen our understanding of our global supply chain through our ESG survey give us a baseline for enhancing our metrics and achieving forward-looking goals, including: Completing more than 90% of the assessments of raw material spend to Goodyear's ESG information (through our survey or similarly) by December 2020 - Completed and annually updated Creating and implementing an action plan to improve the performance of each raw material supplier below a defined ESG survey score by December 2020 - Completed and annually updated Updating Supplier Code of Conduct - Complete - Released September 2021 Achieving 100% ESG survey response rate from suppliers of strategic indirect materials - Successful pilot wave of ~20 strategic indirect suppliers with 100% response rate.

The system aligns with recognized standards, including ISO 45001 , and serves as a valuable infrastructure to support our response to COVID-19. Our pandemic response focuses on risk assessment and the deployment of countermeasures in alignment with the hierarchy of controls. The controls, including engineering controls, administrative controls and personal protective equipment, were deployed through our employee teams and governed through global, regional, and local steering committees and audit and inspection processes. Plant Optimization (P.O.) is our manufacturing operating system that is built on the foundation of People and Environmental Care (PEC). Associates are meaningfully engaged in EHS through PEC. Over the past four years, 802 associates completed the formal two-week, intensive P.O. Academy. The number of completed P.O. Academy eLearning courses was 21,486 in 2021, which is an increase from 20,421 in 2020 and 13,484 in 2019. Work-related hazards are identified through associate recognition and identification, audits conducted by third parties skilled in the identification of EHS hazards, and facility management and safety team engagement through audits and safety walks. We use technology to track and execute our safety audit and inspection process. For example, the store locations in our North America Retail Operations complete their field leadership audits using our Risk Identification and Management System (RIMS) mobile application for ease of reporting, trending and tracking findings to closure. Formal health and safety committees represent 100% of our manufacturing associates. RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS26 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTPERFORMANCE Goodyear measures our safety progress through both leading and lagging indicators. In 2021 we expanded our leading indicators to include key metrics related to ergonomics; industrial hygiene; EHS management system maturity; associate engagement; Corrective to audits, inspections and near-miss incidents; near-miss incident reporting; Serious Injury (SI) and SI Potential; Total Incident Rate (TIR) (injuries that require medical treatment above first aid and restricted/lost-time injuries); contractor injuries; and first-aid injuries. As mentioned earlier in this report, because our acquisition of Cooper did not close until June 2021, this report does not feature many Cooper activities or events, nor does it include data from legacy Cooper facilities unless otherwise noted. All incidents, including injuries, illnesses, near misses and property damage, are investigated. Causes are then identified, and corrections developed and implemented. These are captured in our EHS Management System for internal escalation, sharing of lessons learned, analysis, and data analysis. We experienced a reduction in total serious injuries from our baseline year of 2018. However, we did experience 13 serious injuries in 2021. We remain committed to take actions needed in the furtherance of our goal of eliminating all serious injuries and fatalities in our workplace. We will continue to learn and build maturity in SI prevention, and teams throughout our global footprint are committed to reaching our goal of zero. Detailed metrics can be found in the data table . SERIOUS INJURY (SI) PREVENTION To achieve our vision to be known as having the safest operations in the world, we focus our EHS efforts on continuously reducing the risk of serious injuries. We've identified serious injury risks, which we refer to as our Serious Injury Indicators, based on a review of incident history, external benchmarking and industry best practices. In 2021, we matured our SI Prevention capabilities in many areas, including a closure of 2,146 Serious Injury Indicator opportunities identified through more than 350 gap assessments performed in 2020. Additionally, we deployed several elements of our strategy to improve \"how\" we lead Serious Injury Prevention. Those key elements include our safety leadership curriculum, which we deployed to senior operational leaders in 2021 and will be cascaded through the organization beginning in 2022. We also launched a Serious Injury Prevention playbook, which is a step-by-step guide describing how to operationalize serious injury prevention learnings, principles and practices. SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY Reliable data and easy-to-use technologies are vital to EHS decision-making. We have created internal processes to provide reliable data and invested in industry leading EHS management system software and mobile tools that generate real-time data analysis. This allows us to drive decision-making that supports our strategic goals. We continue to expand our use of technology and access to real-time data on the frontline. INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE Preventing work-related illness in the workplace begins with understanding the potential impacts of noise and the substances used in the manufacturing process. We assess workplace exposures through monitoring, which validates that controls are effective and provides transparency to associates. Goodyear's industrial hygiene process uses best practices and regulatory and consensus standards to move beyond compliance. To advance global alignment, capabilities and visibility, in 2021, we worked with our group of global subject matter experts to develop tools and training guides to build capability and drive continued maturity at our facilities. ERGONOMICS Goodyear's Ergonomic Core Teams implement a six-step problem-solving process to reduce injuries and maximize workplace performance, and our Ergonomic Core Teams' efforts have contributed to our overall incident rate reduction. In 2020, we introduced motion capture technology to our ergonomic teams, which is a technologically enhanced way to assess jobs for musculoskeletal risks. The technology harnesses artificial intelligence and computer vision to accurately assess jobs and capture real-time data with a video camera or mobile device. The motion capture technology was leveraged globally in 2021 to drive ergonomic improvements. As an example, our Chemical division embraced the technology after they recognized the improved accuracy and reduced assessment time. They are currently using the technology to perform all of their new ergonomic assessments and they have reassessed several existing tasks. The reassessment allowed us to implement corrective actions and reduce risk to associates. Not only has the new technology improved our risk reduction capabilities, but it's also opened up associate engagement opportunities. The technology makes it possible for even more associates to engage in the ergonomics assessment process. USTMA awarded Goodyear a 2021 Innovation Award, part of its Sustainability Awards for Workplace Safety and Health. In the technology category, USTMA honored Goodyear for its Goodyear motion capture app that performs ergonomic risk assessments. RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS27 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTOPERATIONAL IMPACTS Goodyear's SVP Global Operations and Chief Technology Officer oversees the teams that implement our robust approach to operational environmental impacts. This includes our network of global, regional and facility leaders in EHS, Sustainability, Engineering and Procurement. Our EHS Policy is our guiding principle for all levels of management, associates and contractors to continuously improve the safety and health of our workplaces and protect the environment. We carefully monitor our energy, GHG emissions and water use, set company-wide and facility-specific goals to reduce our operational impacts, and continue to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. In 2021, Goodyear continued the integration of energy management principles through the cross-functional efforts of our Manufacturing, Engineering, Procurement and Sustainability teams. Energy management is integrated into the P.O. operating system, which embraces a zero-loss mindset and is active in 30 of our plants. This includes aligning energy management with several of the key pillars of P.O., such as focused improvement, daily equipment care, reliability excellence and early equipment management. During 2021, our manufacturing operations and production levels continued to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in an inefficient use of energy. ENERGY PERFORMANCE Despite the ongoing pandemic, we continue to focus on our energy program. Through the integration of energy into P.O., we work to reduce energy through zero-loss thinking and equipment efficiency, led by global, regional and plant engineering teams. The energy loss assessment within our overall manufacturing zero-loss assessment reviews different categories of energy losses that can occur in all areas of the manufacturing facility, such as steam use, utility costs, heating and cooling, and electric use efficiency. Upon completion of the annual energy loss assessment, each plant identifies its greatest opportunity areas and sets its own goals in BTUs per pound of production. These goals are incorporated into Goodyear's global energy reduction goal. We have identified almost 500 energy efficiency projects in our most recent five-year plan that leverage a zero-loss culture to prioritize opportunities, target cost reductions and increase efficiency. Our savings in energy efficiency in recent years, on average, has been $10M each year. However, in 2021, our savings increased to $16M as a result of energy-saving programs that were implemented in 2021 after being delayed in 2020 during the height of the pandemic. Through our efforts, we have reduced our global energy intensity by 18% versus our 2010 baseline.In addition to our annual energy loss assessment and goal-setting process, Goodyear reviews and updates our energy strategy annually. Some of our recent strategic initiatives included increased sharing of best practices, the creation of a global energy project catalog and identifying key initiatives for the regions and plants. In 2022, we will continue to focus our efforts on increasing utilization of renewable energy and the expansion of metering at the plants to enable more robust, real-time monitoring of energy performance in a centralized energy management system in accordance with our digital manufacturing strategy. The launch of our Global Energy Dashboard is the first step in this process, and we will continue to expand this system as we mature our metering implementation globally. In 2021, some of our energy efficiency projects included: Steam turbine installation at our Aurangabad, India, plant resulted in 1,170 MWh power generation and GHG emissions reduction by 1,105 MT. Upgrading compressors in Ballabgarh, India, and Tatsuno, Japan, to more efficient centrifugal compressors contributed to a reduction in power consumption by 3,133 MWh and GHG emissions reduction of 1,547 MT. Online steam trap installation in our Bogor, Indonesia, plant helped reduce gas consumption by 125 MMBTU and GHG emissions reduction by 6.7 MT. Installation of energy efficiency pumps in Pulandian, China, and Aurangabad, India, resulted in annual power savings of 737 MWh and GHG emissions reduction of 618 MT. Automation of the oil temperature control system in the mixing area at our Adapazari, Turkey, plant resulted in reduced machine down time, improved pump motor efficiency by 68% and achieved a quick investment payback of less than two months. Adding eight variable speed drives to the HVAC system in Izmit, Turkey, allowed for the optimization of the ventilation system according to the plant indoor temperature. This system has resulted in an annual energy savings of 652 MWh and an investment payback of less than six months. Replacement of thermodynamic steam traps with venturi-based condensate steam traps at our plant in Riesa, Germany, has resulted in significant savings for steam use, product quality, and reduced maintenance required to fix broken steam traps. In total more than 660 steam traps have been replaced since 2018, resulting in a steam savings of approximately 50 MWh/press/year. Goodyear has 41 energy coordinators at our manufacturing facilities who are responsible for identifying energy efficiency opportunities and implementing the energy optimization strategy. Many of our energy coordinators are certified energy professionals, which Goodyear strives to have at our major manufacturing facilities. Internationally recognized certifications enable our plant energy coordinators to effectively develop projects related to energy efficiency and meet our corporate efficiency goals. RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS28 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTWe believe we will reduce our energy consumption and have set a global energy intensity goal for a reduction of 25% by 2023 compared to our 2010 baseline. To realize our goal, we will focus on energy reduction opportunities at our plants, as well as expand our focus to include renewable energy opportunities. In 2021, Goodyear announced it will adopt 100% renewable energy at its Goodyear plants across Europe and Turkey as the first step in a multiple-phase plan to procure 100% renewable energy in all its facilities across Europe, Middle East and Africa by the end of 2022. By purchasing around 700,000 MWh of renewable electricity, Goodyear can ensure that manufacturing plants in France, Germany, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovenia, Turkey and the Netherlands will operate on sustainably sourced electricity. This shift will reduce the company's carbon footprint by up to 260,000 MT. The increased use of renewable energy at our manufacturing facilities will help Goodyear achieve our climate goals , and several of our plants have already imple - mented renewable energy. For example, our plants in Chile and Peru purchase 100% renewable electricity from hydropower, eliminating CO2 emissions from the plant's electricity intake while reducing energy costs. In addition, in our AP region, there are solar instillations at our plants in Aurangabad and Ballabgarh, India; Bogor, Indonesia; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Bangkok, Thailand. The investments in solar in our AP region have resulted in the generation capacity of approximately 4.7 MW of electricity with plans in place in 2022 to add additional onsite solar, bringing the generation capacity up to 7-10 MW. Goodyear's EMEA region also committed to the procurement of 100% renewable electricity through Energy Attribute Certificates (EACs) in late 2021. In our Americas region, our facility in Lawton, Oklahoma, began to procure a portion of their electricity from wind power in late 2021. Globally, our total renewable purchases and generation at our Goodyear manufacturing facilities account for 17% of our annual electricity consumption. We are projecting to increase the amount of renewable electricity to 28% in our footprint (including at legacy Cooper Tire facilities) in 2022 through our implemented and planned activities. To continue the progress we have made, we established a cross-functional team within our Manufacturing, Global Engineering, Procurement and Sustainability teams to develop a global renewable energy strategy that will help us achieve our climate goals. In 2021, we worked with a renewable energy consultant to help develop a global roadmap for implementing renewable electricity at our facilities. This roadmap is helping us to define our long-term strategy to procure and generate renewable electricity in our manufacturing operations. In addition, we are beginning to investigate how we can significantly reduce the direct emissions from our operations by switching fuels to renewable options and developing new technologies for our processes.

To see how we are addressing these Scope 3 emissions, see Advancing Tire Performance . Within our operations, our drive to reduce energy consumption also benefits our GHG emissions reduction goal, contributing to a 24% reduction of GHG emissions in our operations since 2010 and progress against our goal of 25% GHG emissions reduction by 2023, from a 2010 baseline. In 2021, Goodyear announced our climate goals . While these goals are for our entire operations, reducing our emissions in our manufacturing footprint will play an important role. In 2022, we will reassess the emissions goals for our manufacturing footprint to help ensure they are aligned with our climate goals. Additionally, we will continue to focus on switching to renewable energy for our electricity and fuel sources, developing new technologies and consistently improving energy efficiency. WATER PERFORMANCE Goodyear's production of tires is not a water-intensive process and we use water primarily for cooling and sanitary purposes. However, we do operate in areas where water stress can be high. Therefore, we strive to continuously reduce our water use. To understand the full breadth of our water footprint, we track water use and water withdrawal data at 43 of our facilities, and we use the WRI Aqueduct Tool to annually assess water stress, down to the basin level at every location. We have nine facilities in areas exposed to water risks, but those facilities are some of Goodyear's most efficient in terms of water use. Additionally, even though our usage is not substantial in water-scarce locations, we include the WRI assessment results, where relevant, in new project scopes to ensure projects will not have negative impacts on local water supplies. Goodyear's goal for water use is to maintain our strong performance at our most efficient facilities, while improving water efficiency at our highest-intensity and water-stressed locations. Our facilities in high-stressed locations and the largest water users in each region evaluate their reduction opportunities and implement best practices for continued water savings. Our newer plants\u2014for example, in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, and Dudelange, Luxembourg\u2014are designed to meet high standards in water efficiency. GLOBAL WATER USE 1,1921,4302,7322010 202120202019 Global Water Usage (Gal/Ton) *Performance adjusted for capacity utilization17% change from 201055% change from 201015% change from 20103,204 RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS30 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTGoodyear first set a goal to reduce our global water use by 33% compared to our 2010 baseline, which was a goal we achieved in 2020 by reducing our global water usage by 55%. We then set a goal to achieve a global water reduction of 10% over the next 10 years. That goal was achieved in 2021 when we reduced our water usage by 17% compared to 2020, using 1,691 gallons of water per ton of production at our tire and chemical manufacturing sites. Going forward, we are evaluating where we can further reduce our water consumption and will set a new long-term goal for our global operations, which will include legacy Cooper facilities. In 2021, some of our water efficient projects included: Our plant in Pulandian, China, implemented a project to reuse wastewater in cooling towers, saving up to 26,000 gallons of water per day. A reverse osmosis treatment system was installed at our Izmit, Turkey, plant, resulting in the savings of more than 6.6 million gallons of water with an investment payback of less than six months. The implementation of a rainwater harvesting system for use in the sanitary system at our plant in Colombia resulted in a savings of 285K gallons of water per year. Our plant in Topeka, Kansas, reduced the amount of well water used in its fire water system by making adjustments to the level control, reducing 50% of consumption and saving approximately 600K gallons of water a day. A variety of water reduction projects at our plant in Chile included recirculating pumps, water reuse from boilers in the cured water system and a water level control system, together resulting in a savings of more than 114 million gallons of water each year.We source the water we use from public utilities, wells, lakes and streams, of which 25% (1.443 billion gallons) is from public utilities and 75% (4.416 billion gallons) is from well and surface waters. To reach our goal, we performed a study at our plant with the highest water use, assessing it for potential water reduction projects and rating priorities. We plan to continue to leverage closed-loop cooling systems, onsite treatment plants, and evaporative cooling to capture process water and steam condensate to reuse and reduce the use of water. WASTE AND SOLVENT PERFORMANCE Goodyear established a Zero Waste to Landfill expectation at our tire and chemical manufacturing plants in 2006, and since then we have continuously improved our waste management practices by maintaining corporate standards, processes and systems to help ensure the appropriate disposition of our wastes and other materials. To properly manage and confirm the continued success of our Zero Waste to Landfill program, we have monitoring measures in place, such as waste reports differentiated by waste types and dispositions and a detailed waste vendor approval process. We require our waste vendors to comply with our Zero Waste to Landfill program, and we monitor and audit performance to ensure compliance. If we discover any deviation from the program, immediate actions are taken, which can include corrective action plans or the termination of vendor contracts. We continue to strive to reduce solvent usage and, consequently, solvent emissions at our manufacturing and chemical facilities. Since 2010, we have reduced global solvent use by 43%.RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS31 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTRELEASES TO THE ENVIRONMENT We are committed to reducing the environmental impacts of our manufacturing operations. Our goal is to achieve zero environmental compliance violations, and that includes our reportable releases and notices of violation. In 2021, we experienced 18, which included nine reportable releases and nine notices of violation. Thirteen of those 18 items arose in one business segment where we've since initiated targeted improvement strategies. PRODUCT QUALITY We ensure consistent quality through our robust Quality Management System (QMS). Our QMS provides a framework for our quality standards, minimum requirements and best practices that govern and enable our global operations. Goodyear continuously improves our QMS through the execution of our Global Quality Strategy, ensuring that we retain a quality leadership position in every region where we operate. Another way we ensure quality consistency across our facilities is through certified adherence to industry-accepted standards. While all of our facilities are ISO 9001 -certified, our OEM-producing plants are certified to the higher IATF 16949 standard, which is specific to the automotive industry and required by certain customers. Quality is touched by every major level of the Company. Goodyear has a Product Performance Advisory Committee composed in 2021 of our: SVP & General Counsel; SVP Global Operations and Chief Technology Officer; VP Global Quality; VP Global Operations; VP Global Manufacturing; Director Government Compliance and Product Performance; and the president of the applicable strategic business unit. The committee meets as needed to discuss product quality issues, including those that may require some field action. There are also quarterly reviews with members of senior management to review field performance data. In addition, there are global-, regional- and plant-level quality teams that manage quality procedures and audits and implement continuous improvement actions when necessary. Finally, our production associates receive annual training on product quality and safety. This organizational approach, coupled with robust early warning systems and containment procedures, helps Goodyear maintain an industry leading position in the area of product field performance. Manufacturing facility audits, by both local plant associates and regional functional experts, are conducted through a structured and layered audit process approach. This approach fosters engagement and ownership of our quality standards down to the floor-level associate. Additionally, external OEM customer auditors and third-party auditors who review adherence to international quality standards, such as ISO 9000, IATF 16949 and AS 9100, complement our internal assessments. CUSTOMER SATISFACTION PERFORMANCE A critical aspect of Goodyear's product and process quality is our goal of meeting and exceeding customer requirements. We monitor our progress toward this vision through our self-developed OEM customer index, which provides an end-to-end analysis of how we are doing at any given time with each of our OEM customers. This index utilizes a combination of leading and lagging quantitative and qualitative metrics to score overall OEM customer satisfaction, highlighting our priorities and areas for customer relationship improvement at a glance. We also measure customer satisfaction through warranty cost per net sales, which is the cost to fulfill warranties compared to net sales. This metric provides a barometer to measure Goodyear's ability to deliver full value of our tires from point of purchase. Goodyear is among the industry leaders in warranty cost per net sales, and our goal is to maintain this status. 2021 2020 2019 Warranty cost per net sales 0.17% 0.22% 0.22% Product quality performance trends continued to evolve positively in 2021. We were focused on the safety of our associates and the quality of products as we managed through the continued impact of COVID-19. The company continues its firm commitment to the execution of key quality strategies toward the quality vision and supporting our Connected Business Model. END-OF-LIFE TIRES (ELT) Globally, an estimated one billion tires reach the end of their useful lives every year. The proper recovery and reuse of end-of-life tires (ELT) help to contribute to a circular economy, where they can be seen as a useful resource. Goodyear plays an important role in managing ELT at our own locations and through promoting the reuse of ELT through new markets. However, proper ELT management requires a multi-stakeholder approach because tire replacement often occurs in locations outside of a tire manufacturer's control and ELT management involves many actors along the value chain. In order to do our part, Goodyear: Promotes the proper management of ELT in our company-owned retail locations; Conducts research and collaborates with external organizations on the development of ELT recovery methods and uses of ELT as raw materials; and Actively collaborates with industry peers through TIP and RTTAs to advance industry-wide ELT management systems. RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS32 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTPERFORMANCE Globally, a number of ELT recovery systems are already highly developed, such as in Europe, Japan and the U.S., with recovery rates of 92%, 92% and 81%, respectively.4 However, we will continue to work internally and collaborate with our industry peers in the search for improvement with the goal of reaching 100% recovery for all tires worldwide. According to the latest USTMA Scrap Tire report , almost 76% of scrap tires in the U.S. were recycled into products such as rubber modified asphalt, new manufactured automotive products and mulch for landscaping and other products, or used as tire-derived fuel. This is down from 96% in 2013 when scrap tire recycling peaked. Within Goodyear, a cross-functional team contributes to the successful management of ELT from our company-owned locations, reviews current trends in ELT management, develops internal activities for new technology related to the use and recovery of ELT as a raw material, and aligns on regional ELT activities where we operate and sell tires. In 2021, we began collecting metrics on the recovery routes from our company-owned retail and commercial truck locations based on the TIP ELT Waste Hierarchy , and a common reporting methodology, to better understand the disposal of ELT we manage. Collecting this information from our waste management vendors for ELT will allow us to further advance the beneficial reuse of ELT. Goodyear is also working to develop ELT as a raw material, promoting a circular economy. Goodyear tires may contain recycled materials, such as recycled rubber compounds that may include devulcanized butyl rubber, which has been used by Goodyear for more than 20 years. It comes from used truck tubes and can replace some virgin polymer and carbon black in the liner compound. Other devulcanized rubbers and ground rubbers from ELT can be used in various tire compounds. Tire materials such as steel in bead wire or steel cord may contain recycled content (pre- or post-consumer) where the recycled material may vary. We are exploring additional opportunities to use recycled materials in our tires such as recycled styrene for use in making styrene butadiene rubber. We also continue to investigate traditional recycling processes that provide acceptable properties beyond our current applications and are looking to work with customers to support beneficial reuses of tires.We continue our active involvement in TIP's work to promote ELT recovery routes, especially in developing nations, and its research regarding emerging uses for ELT, such as rubber-modified asphalt and the development of new markets. In addition to our work with TIP, we continue to be active in the USTMA's and ETRMA's ELT market development efforts. 4Global ELT Management - A global state of knowledge on regulation, management systems, impacts of recovery and technologiesCooper Tire plants in Findlay, Ohio, and Tupelo, Mississippi, sponsor annual tire amnesty days to promote proper scrap tire disposal in their communities. Working in cooperation with local or county management, Cooper associates volunteer to accept used tires and load them in trailers for transportation to a local tire recycler, collecting more than 4,000 tires each year. Associates also take the opportunity to hand out tire safety kits that include pressure and tread depth gauges, tire caps and tire safety information. RESPONSIBLE OPERATIONS33 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTBUSINESS CONTINUITY Goodyear's Director Global Business Continuity aligns with all Business Continuity teams comprising representatives from each business unit and global and tactical functions. Governed by a senior leadership committee, these teams implement a risk-based, decision-making Business Continuity Process with steps for preparedness, response, restoration and recovery for any incident Goodyear may face. The focus in 2021 was on high-potential and high-probability impact operational risks as we recovered from COVID-19. The risks included infectious disease and variant impacts; supply chain events; natural incident occurrences; and IT infrastructure reliance. This Business Continuity Process is aligned with the Disaster Recovery Institute (DRI) International for certification in business continuity. All manufacturing locations, key business units and global leaders complete risk surveys to assess potential local risks. The Business Continuity team then prioritizes risks by highest probability and potential impacts to Goodyear and plans accordingly. At the end of each year, we evaluate actual incidents and set priorities to reduce future frequency and potential impacts. We evaluate the maturity of our Business Continuity Process through an annual Business Continuity Maturity of Excellence process. Based on DRI International's Professional Practices framework for maintaining organizational resilience, our assessment evaluates teams located at our manufacturing facilities. We then set annual targets for continuous improvement. Additionally, team members from each business unit complete monthly scorecards to track execution of activities aligned with our Business Continuity Strategy Roadmap. Included are quarterly meetings, training, contingency plan development and testing, post-incident gap analyses, best practice sharing and benchmarking to bolster our understanding of and response to potential risks. To assess year-over-year progress, we track completion of the following procedures:METRIC DESCRIPTION Business Continuity Plans (BCPs)All locations participate in the Business Continuity Process, based on their size. Facilities with 1-49 associates have a one-page plan, those with 50-199 have a playbook and those with more than 200 have a BC Plan (BCP). Business Continuity SoftwareFacilities with a BCP use business continuity software to track risk assessments and business impact analyses (BIAs), which contribute to the BCP. Business Impact Analysis (BIA)BIAs are surveys to promote discussion among facilities, regions and headquarters around the most critical business processes at a given facility. The action plans outlined in BCPs are based on BIA results. Number of Incidents Classified as either human, natural or technological, incidents are tracked by region, type and duration with more than 2,000 incidents documented since the Business Continuity process was formalized. Business Continuity addressed more than 100 incidents in 2021, in addition to an ongoing focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. All regions and key support teams participated in ongoing tracking of COVID-19-related best practices, allowing for real-time improvements to applicable protocols and practices benefiting our associates and business operations. Average Incident DurationDuration of incidents is measured as less than a day, a day to a week or greater than a week. Approximately 25% of all 2021 incidents involved active team participation for greater than a week with another 25% requiring up to a week's participation and 50% successfully addressed in a single day. Examples included supply chain disruptions, facility fires, security concerns, utility issues, cyber and IT outage events, and natural incidents (hurricanes, typhoons, tornadoes, flooding and earthquakes). 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT ADVANCED MOBILITYADVANCED MOBILITY35 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTADVANCED MOBILITY Advanced forms of mobility\u2014such as fleets, autonomous, connected and electric vehicles\u2014are transforming the tire industry and have the potential to make driving safer and more sustainable. Goodyear is positioned for success through our commit - ments to advanced energy efficiency, safety, tire longevity, comfort and convenience, as well as several digital-based solution offerings. And we don't expect to do this alone. Our Goodyear Ventures fund partners with innovative startups to help drive the future of mobility. Goodyear's innovative spirit and drive for excellence puts us at the epicenter of the mobility revolution. We are working closely with customers and other innovators to shape this transformation. We are excited for the future of mobility and have much to offer the transportation industry through our work in Advancing Tire Performance and Shaping the Mobility Revolution. TOPIC IMPORTANCE Advancing Tire Performance We continue to advance our technologies to help our customers reach their emissions reduction and safety goals and to be part of the solution to these global challenges. OEMs, airlines, fleets and others continue to face significant pressure to further reduce vehicle emissions and energy use and increase safety. Shaping the Mobility Revolution We are driving toward a mobility future in which shared vehicle models and fleets are commonplace, and the vehicles themselves are smarter, safer and emit significantly fewer GHG. Tires are critical components to accomplishing these objectives. ADVANCING TIRE PERFORMANCE Goodyear's Innovation Centers, development centers and regional innovation labs help us develop and test state-of-the-art products and services. Our key business leaders hold annual product and innovation leadership reviews to discuss regional product needs, developing technologies, regulatory changes, customer input, benchmarking, new product roadmaps and upcoming product launches. Goodyear's Technology and Materials teams create roadmaps for potential products, following a global integrated release process that includes technology or product development, prototype testing, manufacturing scale and ultimately product launches. Quarterly meetings discuss progress and emerging market trends and ensure that our processes and products provide optimized tire performance and meet tire labeling and regulatory requirements. When we test our products, we consider regulatory requirements for all countries and regions where we operate, as well as additional testing to meet Goodyear's stringent standards for performance and quality. For example, tire labeling regulations in Europe require three metrics - fuel efficiency, wet grip and external road noise. In Europe, Goodyear was first to achieve an A label in rolling resistance for an all-season tire also rated as 3 Peak Mountain Snowflake-certified. We also test our tires across more than 50 safety and performance metrics before they enter the market. Goodyear also has extended its leadership position in virtual product development with the expansion of vehicle simulation. This included the installation of both compact and fully dynamic driving simulators (shown at right), a first in the industry, providing a level of simulation sophistication to allow Goodyear to drive breakthroughs in future tire creation, leading to an enhanced customer and driver experience. Virtual simulation efforts will help lead to fewer physical testing iterations and provide a more sustainable testing future. As referenced in the Bold Goals, by 2024, Goodyear is seeking to reduce our physical testing iterations to one per SKU, a dramatic reduction from current levels. The automotive industry trend toward a virtual development cycle provides an opportunity for tire development, and this new simulation avenue allows Goodyear to work more collaboratively with automobile manufacturers on original equipment fitments. The driving simulators are being used for virtual development and tuning of dynamic performances of tires, aided by the ability to simulate a range of driving conditions. ADVANCED MOBILITY36 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTIMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY Goodyear's LCA results point to the product-use phase as the greatest opportunity to reduce GHG emissions. Goodyear can foster energy efficiency through our tires' rolling resistance and weight. A tire with low rolling resistance and a vehicle with less weight consume less energy and emit fewer GHG emissions. To help reduce rolling resistance, tire construction must reduce unnecessary weight and minimize the energy losses in the tire while helping provide safe performance. Therefore, we test our rolling resistance and weight reduction advancements in tandem with wet, dry and winter traction to ensure optimized performance in all categories. To illustrate our commitment to improving vehicle energy efficiency, through 2021 we had achieved a 32% reduction in rolling resistance from 2005 baseline values and are working toward another 8% reduction by 2025. Similarly, we decreased tire weight by 8% versus 2005 baseline and are on track to meet our objective of a 9% overall weight reduction by 2025. Goodyear developed state-of-the-art technology in rubber compounding, tire construction and manufacturing to meet the increasing demand for lighter tires with low rolling resistance. Rubber compounding efforts include testing different methods to mix and cure the compound, as well as alternative materials and fillers that could enhance fuel efficiency. For the past decade, Goodyear has applied lightweight technology to many of our tires. Additionally, Goodyear has responded to the increasing electrification of vehicles with tires customized to the unique load, torque, noise, range, rolling resistance and performance requirements of those vehicles. In 2021, we introduced the ElectricDrive GT, our first replacement tire in North America tuned for electric vehicles. This ultra-high-performance, all-season tire delivers long-lasting tread wear and a quiet ride for drivers and passengers.PERFORMANCE Safety is a top priority for Goodyear and all of our stakeholders, including our OEM customers and consumers. Enhanced tire performance comes from wet grip - the braking behavior of tires on a wet road - and added traction for winter road conditions. We continuously innovate and test for potential performance improvements in wet, dry and winter conditions. One Goodyear innovation that enhances tire performance stems from a renewable, bio-based material: soybean oil. A decade ago, Goodyear scientists and engineers - with support from the United Soybean Board - began developing a tread compound in which soybean oil replaced 100% of petroleum-derived oil. Soybean oil helps keep a tire's rubber compound pliable in changing temperatures, a key performance achieve - ment to maintaining and enhancing vehicle grip on roadways. We initially commercialized this innovation in our Assurance WeatherReady consumer tire line, and soybean oil is now used in a variety of our consumer, commercial and racing tires. Given the innovation and performance excellence we're able to provide our customers with these products, Goodyear is successfully working toward the goal of fully replacing petroleum-derived oils by 2040. Visit Sustainable Materials and Sourcing for more examples of Goodyear's sustainable material use. Launched in 2021, the Goodyear ElectricDrive GT is Goodyear's first electric vehicle replacement tire in North America.ADVANCED MOBILITY37 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT As part of its commitment to sustainable sourcing, Goodyear is increasing its use of sustainable materials in its products, including soybean oil. Soybean oil helps keep a tire's rubber compound pliable in changing temperatures, a key performance achievement to maintaining and enhancing vehicle grip on roadways.TIRE LONGEVITY Tire longevity reduces the number of tires that reach their end of life in a given year. This is especially important to Goodyear's fleet customers, who save significant time and labor by replacing fewer tires, as well as electric vehicle customers, who benefit from longer-lasting tires to handle increased torque from electric engines. In 2018, we launched the Assurance MaxLife consumer tire in the U.S., featuring TredLife Technology with easy tread-depth readings and our highest tread wear limited warranty for consumer tires. TredLife Technology can now also be found in our Assurance ComfortDrive and Eagle Exhilarate tires. In our commercial truck tire portfolio, Goodyear's Endurance LHS steer tire is delivering extraordinary mileage, exceeding 200,000 miles* for some fleets. When a new commercial tire's tread wears below the recommended level, commercial fleets can opt to retread the tire. Retreading is a process in which the remaining tread is removed from the tire casing and like-new tread is applied in its place and then cured so the tire can be reused. This cost-effective option allows fleets to extend the life of their tires. Most Goodyear casings are built with the durability and toughness to withstand more than three retread applications. COMFORT Goodyear is working to reduce the road noise from our tires through a combination of tread design and construction of the tire carcass. Because some vehicle constructions are more sensitive to tire noise produced by air vibration inside the tire cavity, we created Sound Comfort Technology to reduce tire air cavity resonance. Our technology applies an open-cell polyurethane foam element to the inner surface of the tire, reducing vehicle interior noise up to 4dB.5 The foam is also light enough to avoid impacting tire weight or rolling resistance. *Actual results could vary based on a variety of factors, including road conditions, vehicle type, driving habits, tire inflation, vehicle loads, and temperature. 5 Test vehicle: Audi A7 3.0 FSI on straight line with measurement parameters of 50, 70, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130 kph, comparison of the airborne sound level in the interior when compared with standard tires. Goodyear tires with soybean oil instead of petroleum-derived oil. In 2021, Goodyear introduced the new Goodyear Assurance ComfortDrive featuring TredLife and ComfortFlex technology.ADVANCED MOBILITY38 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTSHAPING THE MOBILITY REVOLUTION In addition to the innovation management outlined in Advancing Tire Performance, we also consistently monitor our customers' needs and explore technological advances to help meet them. Driven by this customer insight, we are delivering on five key areas: 1. Digitizing the connection with the road 2. Offering vehicle readiness 3. Developing new tire architectures, such as maintenance-free tires 4. Simplifying the consumer buying and tire maintenance process 5. Driving the future of mobility by partnering and investing in seed-to-growth- stage startups DIGITIZING THE CONNECTION WITH THE ROAD Tires are the only thing on a vehicle that touches the ground. That critical position lends itself to breakthrough technology, allowing tires to contribute to enhanced levels of safety and performance. With our global tire intelligence platform\u2014called Goodyear SightLine \u2014data from a variety of on-vehicle sensors is sent to our mobility cloud in real time, where unique, customizable algorithms indicate tire health, deliver performance insights and detect potential issues so drivers can seek proactive maintenance. The benefits of this technology are wide-ranging. We have conducted studies showing, for example, that connecting intelligent tires with a vehicle's automatic braking system can reduce stopping distance loss by 30%. We also created a demon - stration vehicle\u2014dubbed \"Frank\" after Goodyear co-founder Frank Seiberling\u2014that takes the data from sensor-enabled tires and uses it to show tire load, road-friction potential and remaining tire mileage on an in-car display, as well as monitoring road surface anomalies, tire pressure and temperature. Goodyear has set a goal that, by 2027, we will reinvent tires and service, delivering data- and sensor-enabled intelligence in all of our new products.The \"Frank\" demonstration vehicle equipped with tire intelligence technology powered by Goodyear SightLine. Goodyear's ability to service commercial fleets is well established, and we have already begun to offer digital connectedness in the form of advanced telematics and predictive analytics technology. With our proprietary artificial intelligence technology, we help fleets predict when their tires need service or replacement, improving overall tire management and maximizing uptime across the fleet. Tires are among the top expenses for commercial fleets. Through Goodyear services, we can help reduce a commercial fleet's total cost of ownership and maximize return on investment. For instance, by using our digitization tools and sensors such as Tire Optix , our commercial fleet customers will no longer need to physically check the tire pressure of each tire on each vehicle in their fleet, saving time and money. Another tool, Goodyear's Checkpoint Drive-Over-Reader , also aids in this automatic tire-checking practice. Combined, the tools within Goodyear's Complete Tire Management system inspected nearly 4 million tires in a recent one-year period. Goodyear also continues to partner with other like-minded companies to drive efficiency among commercial fleets. That includes our ongoing collaboration with ZF , a global technology firm with which we entered into a long-term agreement. Together our organizations offer transportation companies a one-stop solution for tire and fleet management, including tire monitoring and tire management insights.ADVANCED MOBILITY39 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTWe also joined forces with the Stark Area Regional Transit Authority ( SARTA ) in Northeast Ohio to test intelligent tire sensors and prototype tires on SARTA's fleet of diesel and zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell-powered buses. Connected tires can also enable widespread use of autonomous vehicles. We've partnered with leading autonomous trucking and logistics companies like Gatik , Plus and TuSimple to enhance the performance and operation of their vehicles. Goodyear and Plus announced a strategic collaboration to provide autonomous trucking solutions that elevate the intelligent and connected transformation of the logistics industry. OFFERING VEHICLE READINESS Goodyear offers AndGo , a predictive vehicle servicing platform that provides full vehicle readiness for consumer and commercial fleets. When we launched AndGo in 2020, it was clear that emerging mobility companies needed a better way to service their vehicles. These new companies are spearheading the future of mobility, but they're held back by vehicle servicing solutions that are time-intensive, non-digital and difficult to scale. AndGo's platform solves these hurdles by connecting each vehicle to service providers, such as Goodyear's nationwide footprint, and facilitating services in a connected and seamless way. The platform functions as a marketplace that becomes more efficient as supply and demand increase, leading to ecosystem benefits such as wider service coverage, increased uptime, lower costs, access to new markets and higher revenues for service providers. AndGo is designed to service all connected vehicles. We support many kinds of fleets and vehicle types, including car-share and ride-share fleets, last-mile delivery, electric vehicles, and more. We service light- and medium-duty vehicles in both small and large fleets.DEVELOPING NEW TIRE ARCHITECTURES The architecture of tires will look different in the new mobility ecosystem, where ridesharing and autonomous vehicles will become mainstream. Given the shift in vehicle ownership, lower maintenance and longer-lasting tires will be in demand. Goodyear's development work in non-pneumatic tires (NPTs) is leading to products that are designed to eliminate flats and air pressure checks, contributing to worry-free performance. The technology is part of Goodyear's strategy to develop maintenance- free options for passenger and commercial vehicles, particularly in fleet applications. In 2021, we developed and began in-field testing of an airless tire and wheel assembly for use on autonomous passenger vehicles in cooperation with the Jacksonville (Fla.) Transportation Authority. We also partnered with Starship , which operates a network of more than 1,000 last-mile autonomous delivery robots, to test custom-engineered NPTs . NPTs (\"airless\") are a unique tire architecture that could offer important advantages over traditional tires, including greater durability and zero maintenance. Goodyear and Starship are testing custom-engineered airless tires designed to extend tire life and reduce maintenance activities for Starship's delivery fleet. ADVANCED MOBILITY40 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTSIMPLIFYING CONSUMER BUYING AND TIRE MAINTENANCE We understand that our consumers favor convenience and efficiency. So, we designed a tire-buying and replacement process, Roll by Goodyear, which differs from our traditional tire stores in aesthetics, location and service offerings. Roll service offers delivery options such as online valet booking, where we will pick up and drop off our consumers' vehicles at their preferred locations. Roll brick-and-mortar locations are currently available in the Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., metropolitan areas. Alternatively, we offer a mobile installation service , available in select U.S. cities, where we will travel to a consumer's desired location and install the tires. Available in select markets in the U.S., Roll by Goodyear offers customers a new level of convenience when buying and installing tires. DRIVING THE FUTURE OF MOBILITY Goodyear Ventures , our venture capital fund, fuels the future of mobility by partnering and investing in seed-to-growth-stage startups in emerging mobility technology. Leveraging Goodyear's global resources and technical expertise, Goodyear Ventures is supporting and collaborating with other visionaries that are driving the mobility revolution forward.

Each associate is responsible for acting with honesty, integrity and respect - every day and everywhere we do business.TALENT EXPERIENCE PURPOSE Goodyear strives to enhance all aspects of the talent lifecycle and enable associates to achieve their full potential through the components of the talent experience. We do this by: Identifying and attracting the best talent in our industry Enhancing the performance of our associates Supporting associate growth and career development Building and preparing Goodyear's bench of future leaders Engaging and inspiring our associates to deliver \"above and beyond\" for our business and customers In this section we highlight how Goodyear meets these goals through the associate experience. TALENT ACQUISITION Winning in the marketplace starts with attracting the right talent who embody our values\u2014acting with integrity, inspiring each other, collaborating, embracing change, and delivering results. Goodyear builds and executes unique strategies for attracting interns, salaried associates, retail and hourly positions, and executives. We use key performance indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of our talent attraction strategies and work cross-functionally with business leaders to align on these initiatives. We strive for qualified diverse candidates on slates for external hiring to increase the opportunity to enhance the diversity of our workforce. We post our job opportunities to a variety of diversity-focused career sites and sponsor and support diversity-focused events at our key and target universities and colleges. Critical to talent acquisition is the ability to identify internal talent for open positions. We encourage our associates to check for job postings of interest through Goodyear's career site\u2014the same place where external candidates view and apply for Goodyear jobs. We also encourage our associates to regularly update their professional profiles in our talent management system for career advancement opportunities. We take pride in building and promoting our internal talent, as more than 80% of our open manager positions were filled by an internal Goodyear associate in 2021. INSPIRING CULTURE43 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTAlthough COVID-19 presented challenges to global talent acquisition, our team minimized disruption as we leveraged our virtual interviewing process and \"interview day video\" to give our HQ candidates a feel for our corporate offices. We also continue to enhance our approach to \"virtual onboarding\" to provide a globally consistent structure for essential onboarding activities that orient new associates to the company and their new role, make vital connections with their co-workers and enable them to perform successfully in their new roles. PERFORMANCE Goodyear's Performance and Development Process (PDP) provides associates with the clarity and support needed to enable high performance. This annual process requires associates and managers to tie business objectives to our Strategy Roadmap, which defines how we work and how we win. The process allows us to drive performance during the year through ongoing conversations and coaching focused on the \"what\" (business objectives) and the \"how\" (core competencies). The performance year concludes with a Year-End performance evaluation and conversation that is factored into the ways we reward associates to reinforce strong performance. To enable PDP, Goodyear creates processes and best practice resources for associates and managers to build capabilities and drive performance accountability, partnering with regional talent teams to locally deploy them. In addition, this process encourages associates to take performance and development feedback to create an Individual Development Plan (IDP) focused on acquiring skills, capabilities and experience required to achieve short-term and long-term career aspirations. Goodyear leaders have reinforced the importance of the PDP as we have experienced record levels of participation and process completion in this past year, even as much of the business has been operating in a hybrid environment. LEARNING & DEVELOPMENT Goodyear invests in the professional development of associates and the vital skills, experience and capabilities needed to enable opportunities highlighted within Goodyear's Strategy Roadmap. In 2021, our salaried associates completed an average 13.7 hours of training. Associates have access to a variety of global development resources and processes to advance their careers at Goodyear: Talent Central - a central repository of career development resources The Goodyear Learning Center (GLC) - a collection of 16,000+ courses available to all associates Goodyear Connections - a mentoring system where associates can seek out and access mentors for specific developmental needs Broadly, the GLC offers associates internally developed courses and external courses from providers such as Skillsoft, LinkedIn and Harvard Business Publishing to help them develop leadership capabilities, business skills, and technical capabilities. As the pandemic has continued, we accelerated investments in technologies that improve the effectiveness of virtual learning capabilities and the employee experience of development. We continue to reach more associates at more times with meaningful learning that addresses current priorities. We also continue to prioritize development for our manufacturing associates. Our P.O. initiative engages and empowers our manufacturing associates by focusing on standardized work and improvement processes to emphasize consistency across plants and regions (One Goodyear Way). We accomplish this through ongoing learning experiences and workshops on technical and soft skills. LEADER DEVELOPMENT Goodyear is investing broadly in development aimed at building capabilities vital to leaders. Initiatives to further leadership skills such as communication, connectivity, and appreciation were launched across the business units and functions in 2021. Notably, more than 1,000 leaders have completed a core \"Inclusive Leader Program\" to foster the diverse culture that will help Goodyear drive business results. Across the globe, almost 200 leaders participated in specific efforts to build their resilience and help their associates do the same. Additionally, our General Manager Program, Global Manufacturing Leadership Program and our Plant Manufacturing Director Programs provide training and mentoring to develop the next generation of leaders vital to key leader roles in our business. These programs capture and transfer knowledge from incumbent leaders to aspiring leaders and promote best practice sharing across our business. While these programs were paused in 2021, Goodyear has developed plans in 2021 to deliver these vital programs in a virtual format in 2022. TALENT PLANNING Goodyear is committed to preparing the next generation of leaders through our annual global talent planning process. This mechanism helps our business identify future experience and capabilities needed to win, evaluate talent strengths and development needs against these experiences and capabilities, identify successors, and align on robust development plans focused on helping our leaders reach their full potential. On top of local talent reviews across our global business, our CEO and Chief Human Resources Officer annually meet one-on-one with the top leaders in each region or function to align on succession plans and development actions needed to grow the business of today and enable the leaders of tomorrow. Over the past year we have continued to establish more rigor and consistency in determining successor readiness using a common language of critical experiences and capabilities and have begun utilizing succession metrics to track our progress and measure success. INSPIRING CULTURE44 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTIn concert with our effort in building capabilities for the future is a focus on inclusiveness and developing leaders with diverse backgrounds and experiences. As such, our talent planning process includes a review of our \"Diverse Talent Spotlight,\" a discussion focused on the career aspirations and development needs of high impact diverse talent and actions that are being taken to support them in their career goals. Through this process, we maintain our focus in building a pipeline of qualified, diverse leaders prepared to position Goodyear as an industry leader for today and for the future. ASSOCIATE FEEDBACK One of the most important indicators of our success as a company is how our associates feel about working for Goodyear. Our global engagement survey captures associate feedback about the associate experience and what Goodyear can do to enhance it. Established in 2018, our engagement survey measures engagement and a variety of topics connected to our Strategy Roadmap during the year. Insights from the survey are used to celebrate strengths and identify opportunities to take meaningful actions that drive engagement and increase the likelihood our associates recommend Goodyear as an employer of choice (Net Promoter Score). Notably, we have seen meaningful increases in our engagement metrics, including our Net Promoter Score, since we began the survey. Survey feedback has been essential to understanding and responding to our associates' needs as we navigate through an increasingly volatile global environment. Over the past few years, the Goodyear Senior Leadership Team set engagement-related goals as part of our PDP to keep the organization focused on the importance of building an engaged workforce in a quickly changing industry and talent market. We take pride that we have maintained the significant increases in global engagement achieved during the onset of the pandemic and are pleased to have expanded our engagement efforts to include our global hourly associates (i.e., retail stores and manufacturing plants). In addition to listening to our associates through our engagement surveys, we also offer an exit survey to global salaried associates who elect to leave Goodyear. Our exit survey helps us better understand our opportunities to attract and retain talent and provide additional insights to consider as we seek to improve our career development, engagement, and retention programs. Combined, our listening surveys offer a powerful set of datapoints across the talent lifecycle that help us prioritize where we can be most impactful at improving the associate experience. THE ROAD AHEAD We are focused on continuously improving the people experience envisioned by our Strategy Roadmap. We will broaden and deepen our diversity and inclusion efforts and activate new capabilities needed in leaders at all levels, enabling Goodyear to accelerate its efforts to be an industry leader in enabling mobility. In 2021, we acquired Cooper and began efforts to integrate Cooper associates into Goodyear; that work will continue in 2022. DIVERSITY & INCLUSION We are committed to creating a diverse workforce, represented throughout our organization and our teams, with a goal to have a culture that fosters inclusive behavior. Diversity & Inclusion is also a business imperative at Goodyear. Our commitment to D&I is evident through Goodyear's Strategy Roadmap and the policies that govern our workplace, such as the Business Conduct Manual and Global Zero Tolerance booklet. We have four D&I pillars that guide our organization in this space, including the Diversity & Inclusion Executive Council, Employee Resource Groups, Talent Lifecycle and Education & Awareness. Goodyear's global head of D&I seeks to drive education, participation and engagement in our D&I strategy at all levels of leadership. Senior leaders have accountability for D&I priorities and progress is reported annually to our Board of Directors. As part of Goodyear 's focused D&I journey, we aim to encourage discussion, reflection and thoughtful action by all. We have gained positive momentum through the creation of new initiatives, strong commitment from leaders, and high engagement from associates. INSPIRING CULTURE45 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTDIVERSITY & INCLUSION EXECUTIVE COUNCIL Goodyear introduced the first-ever Diversity & Inclusion Executive Council to enforce the value proposition that visible demonstration by senior leadership is key to the success and sustainability of a D&I strategy. The Council has representation from every Goodyear business and region. They are visible champions who help to reinforce D&I initiatives and create momentum in our teams. This group meets on a regular cadence and reviews key programs designed to help operationalize Goodyear's vision of a diverse workforce with an inclusive culture. One example of the Council's visibility is during Global Diversity Awareness Month in October, members from the D&I Executive Council took part in a roundtable discussion where they reflected authentically on their role as Council members and how to embed the D&I strategy into their businesses. This was received as being transparent and positive by associates. EMPLOYEE RESOURCE GROUPS (ERGS) Goodyear's commitment to fostering an inclusive workforce is represented through eight Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) that boast 32 global chapters with more than 3,300 associates: Abled & Disabled Associates Partnering Together (ADAPT)\u2014this is a brand-new ERG that broadens our associates understanding of people with disabilities. Asia India Middle East Network (AIM) Goodyear Black Network (GBN) Goodyear Pride Network (GPN) Goodyear Veterans Association (GVA) Goodyear Women's Network (GWN) HOLA (Hispanic/Latino) Next Generation Leaders (NextGen) In 2021, we also added new chapters of our established ERGs including Australia/ New Zealand GWN, and NextGen Shanghai. Our ERGs have executive sponsorship and provide associates with mentoring, profes - sional development, networking and community volunteerism opportunities. The global footprint of our ERGs results in collaborative events that have a positive impact on our associates, business and communities. These celebrations foster cultural education, improve awareness and play a large role in highlighting the diversity at Goodyear to ensure associates feel valued, seen and heard. In addition to honoring local, regional and global heritage months, our ERGs connect with associates to enhance the work experience at Goodyear: In Asia Pacific, our ERGs supported an office renovation project in Shanghai to help equip associates with workspaces that meet their needs. In EMEA, a new Executive Board was created for GPN and GWN to enable more effective dialogue. In the U.S., the discussions many of our ERGs had with leadership resulted in an Immigration Center of Excellence to assist in the handling of immigration matters. Goodyear celebrated the members of our ERGs during Global Diversity Awareness Month via a virtual awards ceremony that was attended by more than 3,500 global associates and leaders. More than 60 nominations were submitted for six awards. This event helped to create a sense of community and belonging at work that drives inclusivity across all levels of the organization. EDUCATION & AWARENESS Our Global Office of D&I launched a comprehensive training program for leaders across our organization. The workshop, \"Inclusive Leader Foundations: Understanding Bias to Unleash Potential,\" was designed to bring awareness to and overcome potential biases and enhance leadership skills. Over 1,000 leaders completed this training in 2021. Goodyear also launched a D&I microlearning program for global associates. This initiative allowed associates to learn at their own pace and discuss those learnings with their teams. INSPIRING CULTURE46 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTTALENT LIFECYCLE To help attract and retain talent across Goodyear, a diverse and inclusive culture must be evident within our global teams and functions. To that end, the Global Office of D&I partners with the Talent Management and Talent Acquisition teams to embed D&I into Goodyear's talent processes. We strive for qualified diverse candidates on slates for external hiring to increase the opportunity to enhance the diversity of our workforce. We post our job opportunities to a variety of diversity-focused career sites and sponsor and support diversity-focused events at our key and target universities and colleges. In 2021, we also participated in a Summer Leadership Academy for underrepresented students with the University of Akron, a career fair at Kent State University geared toward LGBTQ+ students and a Purdue Science of Women Engineering networking night, among other important diversity events. One specific example of a program that embeds diversity into our talent process and lifecycle is the Driving Opportunity Scholars Program. In 2021 the Goodyear Foundation committed $1.6M to The University of Akron to launch this new program designed to increase job readiness training for underserved students. This gift will support full tuition and fees scholarships for 15 undergraduate students over the next three years and provides Goodyear mentors that will follow the students through their undergraduate program as well as Goodyear internship experiences for these scholars. HEALTH AND WELLNESS Goodyear's highest priority continues to be the health and wellbeing of our associates, aiming to improve quality of life and productivity. We support this vision through GoodLife, our global wellness program that embodies a holistic approach to health and wellbeing that our associates, families and partners can champion. We measure our progress in three ways: 1. Overall wellness of our associates, including physical, emotional, financial and social health; 2. Health of our worksites; and 3. Engagement in our wellness programs. HEALTHY ASSOCIATES We encourage a healthy workforce through various voluntary programs, a Healthy Choice Incentive, wellness physicals and year-round vaccination clinics.In 2021, HealthStat, the GoodLife Health Center provider, administered the following programs at Goodyear's Global Headquarters: Flu shot clinics COVID-19 vaccination clinics COVID-19 booster clinics To ensure our associates have access to timely health information that reinforce our global health strategy, GoodLife relaunched a new brand identity and global intranet on April 7, in honor of World Health Day. With a refreshed online presence, Goodyear associates can learn about emotional, fi n a n c i a l , p h y s i c a l a n d s o c i a l h e a l th v i a tr a i n i n g c o u r s e s , e d u c a tio n a l a r ti c l e s , w e l l n e s s ti p s and more. GoodLife online features our Employee Assistance Program (EAP) as well, which is available to all associates and their families worldwide. Goodyear also added onsite EAP counselors at several of our larger worksite locations and conducted orientations to help familiarize associates with this resource and all it has to offer. Many of the programs GoodLife hosted this year were focused on mental wellbeing to help improve resiliency and ensure our associates have resources available to navigate emotional health, including: Mental Health Awareness Month : In May, GoodLife partnered with our ERGs to host educational mental wellness sessions with an EAP representative. World Mental Health Day : On October 10, GoodLife launched a global series of emotional health resources, trainings and information. Throughout 2021, GoodLife also partnered with Achieve Solutions to launch a collection of virtual and in-person wellness workshops. These meetings were designed to encourage dialogue about mental health and highlight the tools and resources Goodyear offers through GoodLife. In 2021, Goodyear's Asia Pacific region launched Project Bounce, which was a fun-filled activity that encouraged associates to improve their physical, mental and social health. With a smartphone-based sports app, associates teamed up with colleagues to track their steps to accumulate the equivalent of 380,000 km, the average distance to the moon. INSPIRING CULTURE47 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTHEALTHY WORKSITES The health and safety of our worksites is an essential component to our business. We continually assess the safety measures in place to protect our associates. This includes personal protective equipment, equipment safeguarding and work procedures. This focus has facilitated the continued operations of our workforce. Goodyear also supports associate health and wellbeing by offering a variety of resources in our worksites. Many of our manufacturing sites have first-responder teams and fire brigades and on-site occupational health clinics, called GoodLife Health Centers. These clinics help provide care for and help maintain a healthy workforce. We also provide an onsite Fitness Center at Global Headquarters and other locations to ensure associates can maintain a healthy body and mind. Smoking on Goodyear property remains an area of opportunity for us to improve, and we continue to work toward our goal of having tobacco-free campuses for 100% of Goodyear facilities by 2025 except where prohibited by law.CULTURE OF HEALTH To evaluate our programming and ensure that our focus is driving us in the right direction, we use HealthNEXT's Employer Health Opportunity Assessment (EHOA) dashboard. With the EHOA dashboard, we regularly assess our progress across more than 210 elements of health and develop an action plan aimed to realize year-over-year improvement. Once established, a healthy workforce culture leads to a healthier business, with reduced lost time and worker compensation costs, resulting in savings outweighing wellness programs costs. Therefore, a culture of health is truly a sustainable business practice.

A thoughtful mix of programs and events allowed us to continue our Goodyear Better Future mission of helping enable safe, smart and sustainable communities in the areas where we operate. The Global Community Engagement team brings Goodyear's community engagement strategy to life, providing tools and guidance to help associates execute volunteer and engagement programs globally. Through collaboration and sharing of best practices among our locations around the world, Goodyear associates seek out valuable ways to positively impact their communities throughout the year. Associates at Goodyear's Corporate HQ can gain both community engagement and professional development experience through Goodyear Corporate Councils. Each Council acts as the liaison between Goodyear and a particular community organization\u2014 coordinating opportunities while also developing leadership qualities. Goodyear's Corporate Councils include, for example: Junior Achievement of North Central Ohio; Akron Children's Hospital; National Inventors Hall of Fame\u00ae Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Schools; and the Akron-Canton Regional Foodbank. This year marked the return of many of our annual community engagement signature events, including the Goodyear Half Marathon & 10K and the Global Week of Volunteering. By keeping a focus on wellness, Goodyear associates were given options to get involved at their own comfort level. The Global Week of Volunteering supported longstanding community partners through in-person projects, collection drives, and at-home opportunities such as creating cards of encouragement for hospital patients and caregivers. Globally, associates volunteered their time and skills to fill the needs of their own communities. PERFORMANCE Our community engagement pillars\u2014Safe, Smart and Sustainable\u2014focus our efforts. This year, Goodyear continued support of healthcare workers globally while also returning to many of our annual community events. To the right and on the following two pages are a few of our efforts from 2021.COVID-19 RESPONSE: CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITIES As healthcare workers globally continued their fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, Goodyear also continued our support of these workers and facilities in our communities. At the start of 2021, associates in India provided a donation of personal protective equipment and quarantine ward supplies to hospitals in their area dealing with high numbers of COVID-19 patients. Goodyear provided Cleveland Clinic Akron General ICU staff with much-deserved supplies including new branded jackets, reusable water bottles, cell phone holders for patients, as well as supplies to create a \"Lavender Lounge\" where staff can take time to relax and de-stress during their shift. At the end of the year, Goodyear answered the call to further support Cleveland Clinic's efforts with a contribution to help support caregivers going through hardships caused by the pandemic. SAFE: PROMOTING SAFE MOBILITY SOS CHILDREN'S VILLAGE - As part of the Global Week of Volunteering, associates in Austria partnered with the charity SOS Children's Village to organize a day of \"fun and learning\" to promote road safety among children. Various activities taught safe behavior for walking near traffic and riding a bicycle, as well as the meaning of road signs they may encounter. INSPIRING CULTURE50 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTSAFE MOBILITY PROJECT - In 2016, Goodyear established the Safe Mobility Project with Akron Children's Hospital with a goal of reducing childhood injuries in the Akron, Ohio, area. In 2021, the Safe Mobility Project team made great strides in serving the community despite challenges presented by COVID-19. Child passenger safety seats and bicycle helmets were distributed to new mothers at community distribution events, including events in areas with high refugee populations where participants could receive instructions and education in their native language. Students received safety education and bike helmets through in-school \"Safety Town\" programs, and high school students participated in Teen Driving Safe Mobility activities. To continue the success of the Safe Mobility Project and build upon the positive effect this program has on our community, Goodyear renewed support of the Safe Mobility Project for an additional three years. SUMMIT LIBERTY HOUSE - The GVA ERG offered the skills and expertise of their members to Summit Liberty House, a housing facility for homeless female veterans and their families, following a security incident. A group of associates visited the building to take note of ways to improve the safety of the residents, and afterwards created a plan detailing projects to make the location more secure. SMART : INSPIRING STUDENTS TO REACH THEIR FULL POTENTIAL DRIVING OPPORTUNITY - The Goodyear Foundation developed the Driving Opportunity Scholars Program with The University of Akron, which will support full tuition and fees over the next three years for 15 undergraduate students majoring in in-demand fields for Goodyear. Those participating in the program will receive a full tuition scholarship, a program laptop, peer and Goodyear mentors and have the opportunity to attend Goodyear events and participate in career-focused activities and internships at Goodyear. STEM CAREER DAY - Goodyear's annual STEM career day encourages students to pursue opportunities in various science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines through creative and engaging projects. In 2021, Goodyear partnered with Soap Box Derby to adapt the program to a virtual format that allowed students to design mini cars that were sent to Goodyear for use in a track racing event. The races were streamed live for the students to watch, with Goodyear associates coordinating the races and providing coverage of the results. Additionally, scholarships were awarded to STEM Career Day participants pursuing degrees in designated STEM disciplines. BACK TO SCHOOL - Goodyear associates in Bucharest contributed to a \"Back to School\" campaign that provided students with backpacks and supplies necessary for their education. The campaign encourages the acceptance of education as a right for all, and the necessity of quality education for a bright future in our communities. SUSTAINABLE: REDUCING OUR ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT KINDERGARTEN REVITALIZATION - Goodyear's San Luis Potosi, Mexico, plant participated in the company's Global Week of Volunteering by revitalizing the Juan Alvarez kindergarten in Villa de Reyes, San Louis Potosi. Associates completed projects including painting classrooms, cleaning the playground, landscaping and donating furniture for use in the classrooms. ZERO WASTE MANAGEMENT - Associates at the Goodyear plant in Adapazari, Turkey, made a commitment to sustainable waste management by implementing a \"zero landfill\" policy throughout the factory. Bins around the factory were labeled for specific type of waste to better allow for recycling and reuse, rather than waste ending up in landfills. The Adapazari plant was awarded a \"Zero Waste Certificate\" from the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization for this program. INSPIRING CULTURE51 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTOHIO & ERIE CANALWAY COALITION - A close relationship with the Ohio & Erie Canalway Coalition allows Goodyear to contribute to the continued upkeep of the historic trails and natural resources throughout Ohio. During the Global Week of Volunteering, Goodyear associate volunteers landscaped around the Howe House in Akron, Ohio, which sits along the Ohio & Erie Towpath Trail and serves as a place for members of the community to learn more about Ohio's trails. Additionally, the annual Goodyear Towpath Trek encourages Ohioans to experience the natural beauty of the trails and explore the communities that connect them. ASSOCIATE VOLUNTEERISM: INSPIRING ASSOCIATES TO SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES Goodyear associates returned to in-person volunteerism in 2021 and further explored alternatives such as at-home activities and collection drives. This year, Goodyear associates logged more than 9,000 volunteer hours with more than 2,000 of those hours logged by members of Goodyear ERGs.THE GOODYEAR BLIMPS The Goodyear Blimps have been supporting communities and nonprofit organizations since 1925 when the Santa Claus Express toy-giving program began. For more than 90 years, Goodyear Blimps have remained committed to dedicating a portion of operational time to community giving. The year 2021 was the 11th in Goodyear's collaboration with the Marine Corps Toys for Tots program, which began by using Goodyear's Blimp bases to generate donations of toys and cash and has grown to several retail stores. In 2021, the program raised a total of $20,000 and generated more than 20,000 toy donations for families during the holiday season, bringing the combined total since 2010 to more than 165,000 toys and nearly $500,000. Additionally, in collaboration with the Goodyear Engineering Explorers Post, the Goodyear Blimps and associates provided customized content to create a \"Blimp Challenge\" for the participating high school students. The students were partnered with Goodyear associates to design a blimp that could withstand specific operating parameters and then build a miniature version to present virtually to the judges. Students and associates were both eager to show off their engineering skills and highlight their learnings to win the challenge. Goodyear also regularly provides blimp ride certificates for charity, generating millions of dollars for nonprofits. In 2021, Goodyear provided nearly 100 ride certificates in local communities, which generated over $150,000 to benefit the recipient nonprofits' missions and work in the community, in a year where many were challenged. INSPIRING CULTURE52 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTCOMPLIANCE AND ETHICS Goodyear's Compliance and Ethics (C&E) Department provides updates on ethics and compliance activities to the Board of Directors multiple times per year. The Board Committee on Corporate Responsibility and Compliance reviews the activities and processes designed to uphold our commitment to ethical behavior. Our global and regional C&E Committees\u2014composed of top company leaders from business and functional areas\u2014meet several times a year to discuss compliance and ethics matters, initiatives, and training. We also update policies and procedures as needed. Goodyear's Business Conduct Manual , updated in 2018, guides our Board of Directors, executive team, and all associates globally. It defines behaviors necessary to support our high standards and reinforces associate compliance with all applicable laws and business practices. The Manual is available on our corporate website, company intranet and in hard copy for associates without internet access. It is available internally in 17 languages to help ensure global comprehension. We regularly update our Manual to ensure it reflects the current workplace and regulatory landscape. On an annual basis, salaried associates must review and affirm their knowledge of the Manual, promise to abide by it and disclose any known violations of certain policies. This review and affirmation included Cooper salaried associates in 2021. Goodyear integrated Cooper associates into Goodyear's Act with Integrity culture and built on Cooper's long-standing Do the Right Thing commitment. COMPLIANCE AND ETHICS TRAINING AND AWARENESS We expect every associate to know and understand our compliance and ethics policies and to abide by them. Goodyear requires almost all global salaried associates and new hires to complete online training covering the Manual and key compliance policies. In 2021, more than 96% of those associates completed online training courses on such subjects as anti-corruption and anti-bribery, conflicts of interest and a Business Conduct Manual course with sections on fraud, financial integrity, workplace respect and discrimination and harassment. We have a three-year training cycle that we review and amend annually to ensure our ethics and compliance training topics remain relevant and address the risks facing Goodyear. Goodyear has continued with its commitment to reaching associates wherever they were during 2021 for compliance training and programs. We conducted in-person and virtual trainings across all strategic business units as well as focused compli - ance campaigns in many countries and plants on various subjects, such as workplace respect (including harassment and discrimination), conflicts of interest, competition law, speaking up, preventing and detecting fraud and bribery, gift and entertainment policies, and privacy. Additionally, our Compliance Week campaigns were held in selected locations around the globe for salaried and hourly associates and covered a wide range of topics through a variety of communication methods, including leadership messages or videos, electronic communications, newsletters, messages on internal digital screens, posters and team huddle sessions (in person and/or virtually). Goodyear's Quarterly Ethics Awareness Campaign, covering topics from the Manual, takes place in our company-owned retail, wholesale and commercial tire service locations in the U.S., United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada, Japan, Africa, Australia, and in our Airship Operations and the Hebron facility. During the 2020 quarterly campaign, managers led their teams in conversations on compliance and ethics subjects such as workplace respect, theft prevention, workplace violence and privacy. INTEGRITY HOTLINE All associates are required to report any actual, suspected, or potential misconduct to management or through the Company's Integrity Hotline . Available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week from anywhere in the world via toll-free telephone or by a dedicated website, our Integrity Hotline allows associates and third parties to report a concern or ask a question, including anonymously (where allowed by law). The C&E Department reviews each Integrity Hotline matter and, in cases where an allegation of misconduct is substantiated, the Company takes appropriate disciplinary or remedial action. Goodyear strictly prohibits retaliation against individuals for making a report in good faith. Speak Up education and awareness campaigns are held to remind associates of the Integrity Hotline and to encourage them to raise questions or concerns. Goodyear conducted numerous compliance campaigns in 2021 reaching thousands of hourly and salaried associates around the world, emphasizing the importance of compliance and educating associates on many topics. At our plant in Peru, for example, the Compliance Week held in July 2021 reached more than 400 salaried and hourly associates and included training sessions, videos and messaging from senior leadership. INSPIRING CULTURE53 INDEX DATA 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTDATA PRIVACY AND PROTECTION Like many global companies, Goodyear faces data security risks, and monitors new and developing regulations and best practices to anticipate and mitigate such risks. For example, in 2018, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaced the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. In 2019, California passed a comprehensive new privacy law, which was amended in 2020, and many other countries and U.S. states are contemplating or have passed similar legislation. As a response to these and other regulations, we regularly review and update our privacy policies and procedures to comply with regulations and privacy best practices and implemented dedicated training programs for associates who interact with personal information. In addition, we take other actions designed to protect the personal data of our associates, customers, suppliers, and others with whom we do business. OPPORTUNITIES To ensure Goodyear's compliance with all appropriate regulations, our C&E Department continually monitors and prepares for upcoming regulations and works to anticipate and mitigate any potential compliance and ethics risks. 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTINDEX DATA 54 ABOUT THIS REPORT Goodyear has been publishing corporate responsibility reports annually since 1996. This report covers activities and events in the 2021 calendar year. It includes information for all global Goodyear operations, including subsidiaries where the Company has a controlling ownership. However, since our acquisition of Cooper did not close until June 2021, this report does not feature many Cooper activities or events, nor does it include data from legacy Cooper facilities unless otherwise noted. Our 2022 report will include information and data for all global Goodyear operations, including legacy Cooper facilities. Operational data are reported on owned as well as leased facilities. All data reported have been collected from our operations based on standard reporting definitions and requirements. Some energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data from our manufacturing plants in the European Union were verified by a third party. Some data have been reported to governmental agencies that check for accuracy. We track energy intensity and measure our progress at our tire and chemical manufacturing facilities through our global data management system. The system helps improve accuracy and metering to provide real-time energy data. Our energy intensity ratio is calculated using total finished production and includes all sources of fuel used in the manufacturing process, including purchased electricity, purchased steam, natural gas, fuel oil, propane, diesel, gasoline, waste fuel, pet coke, and coal. We use the WBCSD and World Resources Institute (WRI) GHG protocol for calculating emissions. According to the WBCSD and WRI, Scope 1 emissions cover direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the Company. Scope 2 emissions account for indirect GHG emissions from the generation of purchased energy. Scope 3 emissions include all other indirect GHG emissions that occur as a consequence of the activities of the Company, but from sources not owned or controlled by the Company. Reported emissions include all Goodyear manufacturing locations where Goodyear has operational control, and detailed direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) sources. These sources include electricity and steam generated offsite and all fuels used in boilers and other combustion equipment, including natural gas, fuel oil, propane, diesel, pet coke, waste fuel, and coal. In 2021, 51% of our emissions were indirect and 49% were direct.We have developed internal recordkeeping requirements that build on OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) lagging indicator requirements and internal definitions for leading indicators. This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option. The GRI Standards are the most widely adopted global standards for sustainability reporting. These standards help businesses and governments understand and communicate their impact on a variety of sustainability issues in a common format. 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTINDEX DATA 55 GRI CONTENT INDEX GRI Standard Disclosure Location Page General Disclosures Organizational Profile GRI 102: General Disclosures 2016102-1 Name of the organization The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company 102-2 Activities, brands, products, and services Overview of Our Business 102-3 Location of headquarters Akron, Ohio, USA 102-4 Location of operations Overview of Our Business; Global Presence 102-5 Ownership and legal form Overview of Our Business 102-6 Markets served Overview of Our Business; Global Presence 102-7 Scale of the organization Data Table 102-8 Information on employees and other workers Data Table 102-9 Supply chain 2022 10-K, pp. 5 ; Sustainable Materials and Sourcing 102-10 Significant changes to the organization and its supply chain 2022 10-K, pps. 2-5 102-11 Precautionary principle or approach Although Goodyear does not formally follow the precautionary principle, we assess environmental risks across our operations. 102-12 External initiatives The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs); Membership in Associations 102-13 Membership of associations Membership in Associations Strategy GRI 102: General Disclosures 2016102-14 Statement from senior decision-maker Leadership Message 102-15 Key impacts, risks, and opportunities Corporate Responsibility ; Stakeholder Engagement and Significant Corporate Responsibility Topics; Better Future Ethics and Integrity GRI 102: General Disclosures 2016102-16 Values, principles, standards, and norms of behavior Compliance & Ethics ; Goodyear Strategy Roadmap 102-17 Mechanisms for advice and concerns about ethics Integrity Hotline2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTINDEX DATA 56 Governance GRI 102: General Disclosures 2016102-18 Governance structure Corporate Responsibility; 2022 Proxy Statement, pps. 1-4 ; Corporate Governance 102-19 Delegating authority Corporate Responsibility 102-20 Executive-level responsibility for economic, environmental, and social topicsCorporate Responsibility 102-21 Consulting stakeholders on economic, environmental, and social topics Stakeholder Engagement and Significant Corporate Responsibility Topics 102-22 Composition of the highest governance body and its committees Corporate Governance ; 2022 Proxy Statement, pps. 1-4; 6-9 N/A 102-23 Chair of the highest governance body Corporate Governance ; 2022 Proxy Statement, pp. 2 N/A 102-24 Nominating and selecting the highest governance body Corporate Governance ; 2022 Proxy Statement, pps. 5-6 N/A 102-25 Conflicts of Interest Board of Directors and Executive Officers Conflict of Interest Policy N/A 102-26 Role of highest governance body in setting purpose, values, and strategyCorporate Responsibility; 2022 Proxy Statement pp. 8 102-27 Collective knowledge of highest governance body Corporate Responsibility 102-28 Evaluating the highest governance body's performance 2022 Proxy Statement pp. ix Annual internal self-assessment If relevant actions are identified they will appear in Goodyear's Proxy Statement.N/A 102-29 Identifying and managing economic, environmental, and social impacts2022 Proxy Statement pps. 3-4 ; Corporate Responsibility ; 2021 CDP Climate Change Response pps. 2-4 102-30 Effectiveness of risk management processes 2022 Proxy Statement pps. 3-4 ; 2021 CDP Climate Change Response pps. 2-4N/A 102-31 Review of economic environmental, and social topics 2022 Proxy Statement, pp. 8 ; 2021 CDP Climate Change Response pps. 2-4N/A 102-32 Highest governance body's role in sustainability reporting The Board of Directors has the opportunity to review, provide feedback, and approve Goodyear's Corporate Responsibility Report annually prior to publication.

In the second half of 2021, Goodyear undertook a materiality assessment specifically focused on climate. Through extensive industry research and internal stakeholder engagement, the following material risks and opportunities were identified. X X Stakeholder Risk Surveys Industry Market TrendsLiterature ReviewsStakeholder InterviewsA B PHYSICAL RISK P1: Limited availability or interrupted supply of purchased materials P2: Extreme weather events causing damage or closure at Goodyear facilities P3: Extreme weather events interrupting access to Goodyear supply chain P4: Disruptions in car manufacturing industry reducing demandTRANSITION RISK T1: Increased demand for low carbon products and sustainable materials T2: Accelerated regulations on carbon intensity, environmental, and social impacts T3: Increased accountability from investors and customers to develop a climate strategy and achieve GHG emission reduction targets T4: New penalties placed on carbon such as a carbon tax T5: Unsuccessful adaptation to emerging technologiesOPPORTUNITIES O1: Increase brand dependability through expanded business continuity planning O2: Differentiate Goodyear products, by reducing footprint of Goodyear tires O3: Leverage circular economies to reduce demand for raw materials O4: Supply chain engagement (esp. natural rubber) for resilience O5: Branding to demonstrate Goodyear's commitment to sustainability O6: Leadership in providing and accommodating new technologies! For the purposes of this disclosure, the material risks and opportunities listed below are the result of the risk identification and prioritization process explained in disclosure (a) Risk Management. 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTINDEX DATA 92 Later in 2022, Goodyear plans to assess these risks and opportunities to understand their potential financial impacts, and further define materiality in this context to reflect those elements. That definition will help Goodyear refine the list of material risks and opportunities to include only those having a potentially significant financial impact. TIME HORIZON MATERIAL RISKS IDENTIFIED Short-Term (0-5 years) 1. Limited availability or interrupted supply of purchased materials 2. Extreme weather events causing damage or closure at Goodyear facilities 3. Extreme weather events interrupting access to Goodyear supply chain 4. Disruptions in car manufacturing industry reducing demand 5. Increased demand for low carbon products and sustainable materials 6. Accelerated regulations on carbon intensity, environmental, and social impacts 7. Increased accountability from investors and customers to develop a climate strategy and achieve GHG emission reduction targets 8. New penalties placed on carbon such as a carbon tax 9. Unsuccessful adaptation to emerging technologies Medium-Term (5-10 years) No additional material risks identified at this time; however, the short-term risks identified above may remain. Long-Term (10-15 years) No additional material risks identified at this time; however, the short-term risks identified above may remain.TIME HORIZON MATERIAL OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED Short-Term (0-5 years) 1. Increase brand dependability through expanded business continuity planning 2. Differentiate Goodyear products by reducing footprint of Goodyear tires 3. Leverage circular economies to reduce demand for raw materials 4. Supply chain engagement (especially natural rubber) for resilience 5. Branding to demonstrate Goodyear's commitment to sustainability 6. Leadership in providing and accommodating new technologies Medium-Term (5-10 years) No additional material opportunities identified at this time; however, the short-term opportunities identified above may remain. Long-Term (10-15 years) No additional material opportunities identified at this time; however, the short-term opportunities identified above may remain. b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning. Goodyear currently is conducting scenario analysis in alignment with the TCFD recommendations and supplementary guidance. Scenario analysis will qualitatively evaluate the resilience of Goodyear's business model in the context of three climate scenarios: 1. \"Failed Transition\" considering high physical risk associated with global temperature rise reaching approximately 4.4C by 2100; 2. \"Current Policy\" considering both physical and transition risks associated with a future state likely to result from policies already enacted or committed to by global governments; and 3. \"Net Zero by 2050\" considering high transition risk associated with a rapid and persistent transition to a low-carbon economy, such that global temperature rise is limited to 1.5C by 2050. 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTINDEX DATA 93 The three climate scenarios will be informed by the most recent physical and transition models published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and International Energy Agency (IEA) in their respective 2021 reports. The climate scenarios will be evaluated across short-term (0-5 years), medium-term (5-10 years), and long-term (10-30 years) timeframes. Qualitative scenario analysis will be followed by a financial impact assessment that will quantify the potential impacts of material risks and opportunities. The financial impact assessment will allow Goodyear to further prioritize material risks and opportunities as they pertain to their level of corporate impact and when impacts may become financially significant. The scenario analysis and financial impact assessment will help identify the impacts of material climate-related risks and opportunities on Goodyear's business, strategy, and financial planning. The knowledge of these impacts will, in turn, inform busi - ness continuity planning (see disclosures (b) and (c) within Risk Management below) and other strategic decision-making aimed at increasing resilience to a wide range of possible future states outlined in disclosure (a) within Strategy. The results of Goodyear's first scenario analysis and financial impact assessment will be made available in an update to our TCFD disclosures and additional annual reporting channels scheduled for later in 2022. Our scenario analysis and financial impact assessment will be reviewed on an annual basis to ensure parameters, assumptions, and data remain relevant. c) Describe the resilience of the organization's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2C or lower scenario. Please see disclosure (b) within Strategy.RISK MANAGEMENT a) Describe the organization's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks. APPROACH: PRIORITIZING RISKS & OPPORTUNITIES Narrowing the Scope of scenario analysis to the most business-relevant risks & opportunities PRIORITY OPPORTUNITIES & RISKSINSIDE-OUT OUTSIDE-INStakeholder Risk Surveys Stakeholder InterviewsABIndustry Market Trends Literature ReviewsX X 10 interviews with 14 internal stakeholders 89 Inter-stakeholder responses 20 risks and 18 opportunities ranked based on level of risk and timetable Review of adjacent industry trends Quantis industry expertise and analysis Review of Goodyear's past work Review Goodyear & competitor CDP reports Review of select industry TCFD reporting Goodyear used a combination of internal and external insights gathered in 2021 to identify and prioritize potentially material climate-related risks and opportunities. A summary of that process is below: 1. Informational interviews with thoughtfully selected internal stakeholders helped to outline Goodyear's \"risk universe.\" 2. A survey distributed to a broader and more diverse group of internal stakeholders evaluated the identified risks and opportunities based on when and how dramatically those stakeholders thought they would impact Goodyear's business model. 3. To balance internal insights from stakeholder interviews and surveys, Goodyear leveraged industry and market trends, benchmarked examples of industry-relevant, climate-related risk reporting, and engaged professional consultants. 4. Finally, the internal and external insights were cross-referenced to consolidate a list of material risks and opportunities. 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTINDEX DATA 94 As stated earlier, Goodyear is conducting a climate-related scenario analysis and financial impact assessment in 2022 to evaluate the potential business impact of each material risk and opportunity. We expect that subsequent iterations of Goodyear's TCFD reporting will include a financial-based definition of materiality and further refinement of the list of material risks and opportunities based on that definition. b) Describe the organization's processes for managing climate-related risks. This report discloses the methodology and outcomes of Goodyear's first climate- related risk and opportunity assessment. Previously, climate-related risks identified through Goodyear's overall risk management process were managed primarily through our business continuity process. Please see disclosure (c) within Risk Management below for information on how Goodyear manages climate-related risks. c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate- related risks are integrated into the organization's overall risk management. Goodyear's processes include a robust Business Continuity function that, among other things, identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related operational risks utilizing frameworks developed by Disaster Recovery Institute (DRI) International and aligns with ISO Standard 22301 \"Security and resilience \u2014 Business continuity management systems.\" Goodyear policy establishes an internal standard operating procedure for major incident reporting that includes climate-risk related events such as disruptions of operations and environmental releases. Goodyear's Business Continuity teams conduct annual risk assessments that feature the following actions relevant to assessing climate-related risks: 1. Risk Assessment (RA) - Identification and prioritization of threats and risks Benchmark industry trends, escalating risks and align on an annual operational risk focus for all regions Review past risk assessment procedures and outcomes Survey internal stakeholders via business continuity software Evaluate the main activities in which the Business Continuity team has been engaged over the past year 2. Business Impact Assessment (BIA) Conduct critical process identification and evaluation Assess how well Goodyear is prepared for these risks from an operational perspective Determine the appropriate Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and potential impacts to operations3. Business Continuity Planning (BCP) Aggregate the data collected during the Risk Assessment to categorize and define risks with the highest probability and impact Summarize regionally reported RTOs to define the time horizon required for recovery planning Develop detailed Business Continuity plans to summarize the actions, resources and tools required in supporting business units, associates and facilities to prepare for, respond to and recover from risk impacts, and restore normal operations within the RTO This process is currently applied to overall operational risks. Going forward, Goodyear will integrate the ongoing identification and analysis of climate-related risks into risk management and other business processes. METRICS AND TARGETS Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities where such information is material. a) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process. To assess the current materiality of identified climate-related risks and opportunities in this context, Goodyear used a risk/opportunity matrix produced from a climate- related risk assessment. See disclosure (a) within Risk Management for a complete description of the process. Goodyear is currently conducting scenario analysis. For this exercise, we intend to use the IPCC's SSP5-8.5 and SSP2-4.5 physical climate scenarios (with most likely temperature outcomes of 4.4C and 2.7C respectively) and the IEA's \"Stated Policies\" and \"Net Zero Emissions by 2050\" climate transition scenarios. Relevant data and analysis from the IPCC and IEA will be used to quantify the parameters, assumptions, and limitations of our three defined climate scenarios. See disclosure (c) within Strategy for additional detail on the anticipated scenario analysis approach. Also underway is a financial impact assessment of the prioritized material climate- related risks. For this exercise, we intend to integrate several metrics including, but not limited to, physical asset values and coordinates, corporate greenhouse gas emissions, activity growth projects, carbon pricing estimates, and historical loss data. Going forward, Goodyear will continue to monitor climate-related risks and opportunities and review our climate risk financial impact assessment and update as needed. This process will be further defined after we complete our scenario analysis and associated financial impacts assessment.2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORTINDEX DATA 95 b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related risks. 2019 Corporate Carbon Footprint in Million Metric Tons (MMT): Scope 1: 1.47MMT CO2e Scope 2: 1.47MMT CO2e (market-based) Scope 3: 11.54MMT CO2e (excludes indirect product use phase emissions) Goodyear's latest corporate carbon footprint assessment was conducted using 2019 data, for both Goodyear's global footprint and the global footprint for Cooper Tire & Rubber Company (Cooper). Goodyear completed our acquisition of Cooper in June 2021; however, Cooper's 2019 data was included to provide full visibility of Goodyear's consolidated corporate carbon footprint. In 2022, Goodyear expects to complete our 2021 corporate carbon footprint assessment and update values for Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These updated figures will be included in the second iteration of Goodyear's TCFD response scheduled to be released later in 2022. Goodyear has identified two key risks associated with our Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions: 1. Policy Risk: The potential implementation of cap-and-trade systems or other market-based approaches to limiting greenhouse gas emissions, such as a government-mandated carbon tax, poses a risk. The existing European Union (EU) Emissions Trading System (ETS) currently requires Goodyear to purchase carbon credits to offset 70% of emissions from energy use in four Goodyear plants in Europe. The expansion of the EU ETS or implementation of similar cap-and-trade systems in the United States or other regions where Goodyear- owned facilities are located may increase the required amount of purchased carbon offsets. Additionally, if the cost of carbon offsets increases over time, the financial impact on Goodyear would be expected to increase proportionately. 2. Reputational Risk: Various stakeholders, including Goodyear associates, customers, investors, and consumers, are increasingly asking for the reduction of corporate carbon emissions. A failure to take actions to comply with these requests poses a reputational risk for Goodyear.c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets. In 2021, Goodyear announced our commitment to achieving the following science- based climate goals, aligned with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi): 2030 Targets: Using 2019 as a base year, Goodyear is committed to reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 46% by 2030 and relevant Scope 3 emissions by 28% over the same time frame. 2050 Target: Goodyear announced our goal to reach net-zero value chain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Performance against near-term climate targets will be evaluated on an annual basis. "}
