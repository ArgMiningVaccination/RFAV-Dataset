(Fall, Spring) (A&H) McElroy This class combines two standard aims: 1) to help students develop their writing skills; and 2) to encourage them to read carefully. At the same time, A 141 offers something unusual: students encounter African American authors of recognized ability whose skillfully crafted statements often are neglected in similar courses. The theme of the course emphasizes the link between the \"power\" of the word and the quest for social justice. Since the harsh days of slavery, many African Americans have mastered the art of writing to better enhance the possibility of making America be America, i.e., a land of freedom and opportunity. Before students finish the course, they will see a clear relationship between their ability to express themselves in writing and their own prospects as shapers of human destiny. Although A 141 and A 142 do not count toward the major, completion of the A 141 and A 142 sequence fulfills the composition requirement and provides A&H distribution credit in the College of Arts and Sciences. Most students enroll in the full sequence, but students may enroll in either A 141 or A 142. A 150 Survey of the Culture of Black Americans (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) The culture of blacks in America is viewed from a broad interdisciplinary approach, employing resources from history, literature, folklore, religion, sociology, and political science.

We will examine hip-hop as an artistic, historical, and sociocultural phenomenon through a survey of the subculture and its elements, but especially the music and lyrics. Additionally, we will focus on the appropriation and exploitation of hip-hop forms by the media and the music industry, \"global\" cultural consumption, the rise and dominance of rap music in popular culture, notions about defining hip-hop today, and on broader issues and concepts in the study of culture. Note: Course taught as an online course only. Meets with FOLK- F 295. A 298 Special Topics in Social and Historical Studies for African American and African Diaspora Studies (3 cr.)

(Fall) (S&H) An introduction to current social, economic, and political issues in Africa. Akan (LING) See \"Foreign Languages.\" American Studies (AMST) A 100 What is America? (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) McGraw Class will explore ideas about citizenship, national identity, and the social contract in the broader Americas. What makes us \"Americans\"? How do we define \"America\"? How does national identity compete with, or relate to, other forms of identity, such as social status or class, religious association, gender and sexuality, and racial or ethnic description? A 200 Comparative American Identities (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Topic: Ethnic Food and Multicultural Identities. Is America a salad bar, in which the ingredients still combine to form a larger whole, with each component retaining its individuality? This course explores how multiculturalism and foodways form a complex image of our nation and of the individuals who form it. As we can clearly see even here in Bloomington, notably on Fourth Street, the cuisine of other cultures has become an integral part of mainstream American culture. But what are the ramifications of this for people from these cultures? We will analyze how identity 2 University Division Guide 2008-2009 is formed and transformed and examine how material cultural artifacts\u2014primarily food\u2014help construct identities. We will explore these and other areas of inquiry as we seek to both define and complicate the ways people in our culture identify themselves as Americans while still retaining individuality and cultural heritage. A 200 Comparative American Identities (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Inouye What is Asian America? This class explores the increasingly controversial status of Asian America as a legitimate political and social category. Beginning with an examination of the origin and history of the term Asian America, the course focuses in particular on who establishes and maintains this category, who belongs in it, and how its many and varied constituents navigate ethnic, linguistic, regional, and racial differences. A 201 U.S. Movements and Institutions (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Topic: New York, New York: Jazz Age and the Harlem Renaissance. During the 1920s and 1930s, New York was a place of constant movement: people of various ethnicities, sexual identities, nationalities, religions, and classes were increasingly interacting with, reacting to, and influencing each other. This exchange, which was accelerated by intellectual, technological, and political forces, prompted a new wave of ideas and trends. To understand all this, we need to take an interdisciplinary approach. How do novels and painting alter the way that we understand newspaper articles and political speeches? What can photographs tell us about New York that we don't find in written accounts? How did jazz inform New York City's architecture? Ultimately, how do these questions change the way that we define terms such as \"New York,\" \"modern,\" and \"America\"? A 201 U.S. Movements and Institutions (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) Inouye Topic: Race and Labor from World War II to the Present. In this course, we will examine race and labor through the experiences of a variety of groups. Examples of the types of questions we will examine include: Are race and labor defined differently during wartime? How so? What is the relationship between race and labor? A 202 U.S. Arts and Media (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Topic: \"Inventing the Indian\": Representing Native American Identity in Nineteenth-Century America. This course offers an examination of \"Indian\" imagery from the nineteenth century that contributed to the construction of Native American identity in the United States. We begin from the premise that \"Indians\" were a construction of the white imagination. In the nineteenth century, Native Americans were turned into \"Indians\" and represented through symbolic types in painting, sculpture, literature, newspaper illustrations, and other popular media. The nineteenth century was a time of intense national expansion, and in the search for a distinctly American identity, symbolic representations of American Indians emerged as a way to fortify U.S. national heritage. We will examine these symbolic representations of Native Americans to see how they contributed to cultural myths such as the noble savage and the vanishing Indian and consider the role of these images in the way that histories are told in America. Anthropology (ANTH) A 105 Human Origins and Prehistory (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Sept and Kaestle What made us human? The story of our past can be found in clues from various sources\u2014everything from details of DNA to evocative murals in Ice Age caves. This is why the scientific quest for human origins requires the curiosity of a philosopher coupled with the skills of a skeptical detective. This course will introduce you to the study of human evolution\u2014a branch of anthropology that seeks to understand human uniqueness by studying the human past using scientific methods from both biological and social perspectives. We can learn a lot about ourselves by studying the behavior of living primates, like chimpanzees. And we can look at fossils and archaeological sites for the evidence that reveals when and where humans first began to behave like \"odd animals\": to walk upright, eat and cook unusual foods, invent tools and art, speak languages, and enjoy social and cultural practices that we consider so \"human\" today. Lectures make extensive use of projected video clips and slides. In addition to online study materials, students will have the opportunity to handle a wide range of casts of both artifacts and bones of living and fossil primates, including human ancestors, and in small discussion sections discuss the challenges and controversies involved in interpreting human evolution. B 200 Bioanthropology (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (N&M) Kaestle, Muehlenbein This course is an introduction to the study of human evolution and diversity. Students learn the basics of evolutionary mechanisms, genetics, primate (including human) anatomy and behavior, human adaptation and evolution, and human variation. Reading assignments are from both textbooks and short current research articles. Skills in reading science writing are stressed, as well as critical thinking. Some class sessions may include meeting in the bioanthropology labs, where students get hands-on experience with bones, teeth, fossil casts, and methods for studying them. This course prepares students for more advanced courses in bioanthropology. E 101 Ecology and Society (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) T ucker E 105 Culture and Society (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Moran, Suslak The world is full of groups of people who speak different languages; eat, dress, and worship differently; and have different ideas about health and sickness, life and death, adolescence and old age. In today's complex world of rapid cultural change and globalization, it is essential for all of us to understand the nature of the similarities and differences found among human groups. This course is a general introduction to the field of social and cultural anthropology. The course will analyze such activities as economic and political behavior, religion, arts, social organization, and thought processes. Illustrations will be drawn from cultures throughout the United States and the world. E 200 Social and Cultural Anthropology (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) T ucker, Stoeltje Contemporary international migrations and communications are bringing us into direct contact with peoples of many regions and different values and ways of life. We are faced with the challenge of understanding other cultural perspectives in order to deal with the realities of ethnic nationalism, religious fundamentalism, and other forces that are shaping the world we live in. In this course we will explore what sociocultural anthropology can contribute to this understanding. E 260 Culture, Health, and Illness (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) Phillips L 200 Language and Culture (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) LeSourd P 200 Introduction to Archaeology (3 cr.)

(Fall) (S&H) Sievert The popular cinema abounds with films depicting swashbuckling characters such as Indiana Jones and Lara Croft, as well as fictionalized ancient people. This course is for students who are drawn to films about archaeologists or Egyptian mummies but who question the depictions of archaeologists and other people that the movies present. We will look at archaeologists on film and compare this with the work that archaeologists actually do. We will address modern issues such as looting, exploitation, cultural property, and antiquities trade and see how artifacts can have lives of their own. We will look at themes in the films: discovery, treasure, exotic places, adventuring, danger, and site destruction.Course Descriptions: Business (BUS) 3 Apparel Merchandising and Interior Design (AMID) See p. 33 for interior design courses.

Emphasis is on reading the original sources to give the student a sense of immediacy with Greek culture. Lectures include ancient religion, drama, mythology, athletics, art, and architecture. C 102 Roman Culture (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Introduction to basic Roman attitudes and thought patterns as they appear in the many aspects of Roman culture\u2014politics, art, religion, government, education, law, engineering, philosophy, private life, and public amusement. Lectures provide background and a context for the firsthand information about Roman culture provided by remaining documents; works of literature, art, and architecture; and other archaeological evidence. In the process of becoming familiar with Roman culture, students will acquire an understanding of the sources of some stereotypes and misconceptions about the Romans and a recognition of how Roman culture influenced Western civilization. C 205 Classical Mythology (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Introductory survey of Greek and Roman mythology. No previous knowledge of the subject is assumed. The principal aims of the course are to acquaint the student with the most important or significant myths, legends, and folk tales from classical mythology (using whenever possible the narratives of the ancient storytellers themselves), to sensitize the student to recurrent structures and themes, and to foster an under-standing of some of the meanings of the stories. C 206 Classical Art and Archaeology (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) An introductory survey of the art and archaeology of ancient Greece and Rome from prehistoric times to the fourth century A.D. Lectures will focus on the nature and objectives of classical archaeology and its contribution to our understanding of the past. There will be three main areas of concentration: the development of the preclassical civilizations of the Aegean Basin (especially Minoan Crete and Mycenaean Greece), the evolution of the Greek city-state (emphasis on Archaic and Classical Athens), and the rise of the Roman Empire (Republican and Augustan Rome, Pompeii, and Herculaneum). Special attention will be given to the development of Greek and Roman architecture, sculpture, and painting. C 209 Medical Terms from Greek and Latin (2 cr.) (Fall, Spring) The formation of words used in science and medicine from basic Greek and Latin roots. During the semester, students gradually learn 700 Greek and Latin words that are frequent elements in scientific vocabulary. By dictation, memorization, and analysis of actual medical or biological terms, the student gains the basics of a highly usable scientific vocabulary. No previous exposure to Greek or Latin is expected or necessary. Note: Class does not count towards any CLAS major. Cognitive Science (COGS) Q 240 Philosophical Foundations of the Cognitive and Information Sciences (4 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) College Intensive Writing section. This course provides the philosophical foundations of the newly emerging interdisciplinary field of cognitive and information sciences. In this field philosophers, psychologists, logicians, computer scientists, neuroscientists, and linguists collaborate to understand the relation of mind to brain, the brain as a digital or an analog processor, modules of cognitive processes, how information is acquired and used, what it is to know a language, what it means for a system to represent information, how one can reason with limited information from different sources, what it means to execute a program, and whether a computer can be intelligent or conscious. The course will emphasize reasoning and writing, rigorous analysis, clear exposition and expression, consideration of various sides of an issue, and organized presentation of information. Q 250 Mathematics and Logic for the Cognitive and Information Sciences (4 cr.) (Fall) (N&M)P: Mastery of two years of high school algebra or the equivalent. This course introduces students to some of the main mathematical and logical tools used in building models in cognitive science. The emphasis will be on the intuitive ideas behind the mathematics, i.e., the main goal is for students to learn the ideas first at an intuitive level and then develop a deeper acquaintance with the ideas. The course will introduce the main concepts and results from first-order logic, machines, set theory, and linear algebra for parallel distributed processing (neural networks). The lab hours will be devoted primarily to the use of computational tools, including Matlab. The material for the course is self-contained, and no prerequisites beyond a sound high school mathematics background are 6 University Division Guide 2008-2009 needed. Credit will not be given for both COGS Q 250 and INFO I 201. College of Arts and Sciences Non-Topics Courses (COLL) C 101 Introduction to Chess (1 cr.)

(Second eight weeks) Hershey and Nichols Two second eight-week class sections are open to all undergraduates. Students must attend an initial orientation meeting and should check the online schedule for the orientation meeting day, place, and time. This course is taught mostly online, but students are required to meet in a classroom to take three evening unit exams. An online examination of the culture of a research university as told through the storied traditions of IU Bloomington. Students will learn about the history of American higher education by examining how the campus has changed since its 1820 founding\u2014in terms of its demography, programs, and buildings. Certain unique treasures of IUB (the Gutenberg Bible, Little 500, the Indiana Memorial Union, the Kinsey Institute) will illustrate issues related to information technology, student activism, commercialization, and academic freedom.College of Arts and Sciences Topics Courses (COLL) A special category of distribution courses called \"Topics in Arts and Sciences\" is open to all students. COLL-E 103 counts in the arts and humanities distribution requirement; COLL-E 104 counts in social and historical studies; COLL-E 105 counts in natural and mathematical sciences. Some Topics-qualified courses (such as those taught by the Hutton Honors College) may need special permission. See your advisor for details on these courses and for restrictions on repeating courses for credit. Topics course goals are to promote critical thinking and effective, cogent oral and written communication among entering college students; to instill awareness, understanding, and appreciation of human diversity; and to broaden students' understanding of, and appreciation for, areas outside their fields of specialization. Topics courses are of moderate size (approximately 100 students) and are taught by faculty. For more information about College of Arts and Sciences Topics courses, please visit the Topics Web site: www.indiana.edu/~bulletin/iub/coas/special.html#topic. Topics courses are open to all students. Students can receive credit for only one version of each specific course. For example, even though individual topics vary, a student may receive credit only once for enrolling in COLL-E 103. See advisor for details. FALL TERM OPTIONS COLL-E 103 ARTS AND HUMANITIES E 103 The Bible and Its Interpreters (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Weitzman Although the Bible was composed thousands of years ago, it remains one of the most influential and relevant texts in our culture. It is also one of the most controversial. How has the Bible managed to remain meaningful for so long and for so many? Why has the search for the Bible's meaning generated so much disagreement and even conflict? The Bible and its Interpreters will examine these questions by exploring how Genesis, the first book in the biblical canon, has been read by different interpreters over the centuries\u2014Jews and Christians, ancient exegetes and modern scholars, the powerful and the oppressed, fundamentalists and feminists. Beyond reading Genesis itself, we will also look at novels, poetry, film, and other media through which people interpret the Bible and relate it to their lives. Our goal is to develop a deeper understanding not just of the Bible and what it means, but of the act of reading as a religious, cultural, and even political act. E 103 Chivalry: Medieval Visions of Good and Evil (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Keller Medieval stories of knights and ladies embody the system of behavior and values that is known as \"chivalry.\" These stories create a fantastic mixture of the real and the imaginary, appealing to interest in history, myth, sex, love, religion, political thought, and, most of all, to the love of a good tale. They can bewilder the modern reader, however, who may not understand at first why knights seem so dependent on the good opinion of others for self-respect (medieval \"honor\" is not the same as the modern concept) and why ladies are content to be fought over, carried off, and rescued without ever seeming to direct their own lives. In this course we will learn the kinds of questions to ask of chivalric stories to allow them to speak with the subtlety and depth they possess, and we will read love songs of the troubadours or court minstrels for further insights into the values of the medieval nobility. E 103 Cloak and Dagger (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Arnaudo The primary focus of this course will be to teach students how to understand the \"rules of the game,\" the conventions and traditions that govern any literary genre, with specific reference to the \"thriller\" as exemplified by selected detective and spy stories in both literature and the cinema. It is my hope that students will apply the lessons they learn about genre in this class to any literary genre, not only genres typical of popular culture, but also those associated primarily with \"serious\" literature (the epic, tragedy, the sonnet, etc.). Students will read the detective fiction of Poe, Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler, Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt, and Leonardo Sciascia. We will also examine several detective films in the film noir tradition, including The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep . For the spy genre, we will read a pre-Cold War novel, at least one James Bond novel by Ian Fleming, and a Cold War spy novel by John Le Carr\u00e9. In addition, we will screen two very different James Bond films, one made during the height of the Cold War, and Martin Campbell's Casino Royale (2006). Note: A maximum of five films are required and will be shown on Tuesday evenings during the semester. E 103 The Examined Self (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Senchuck The word \"philosophy\" means \"love of wisdom\" and, since its origin among the ancient Greeks, philosophy has claimed to be a way of life, or to have implications for how one lives. What is wisdom, and what would it be like to live in love with wisdom? Can such a life be lived by anyone, or is it exclusively for a gifted elite? Furthermore, what is the value of such a life? Socrates famously said that the unexamined life is not worth living, but is this true? To be sure, the reflective life of philosophy has its costs: as Socrates himself learned, societies and states resent the ways in which philosophers question and criticize traditional beliefs and values, and philosophers have found themselves persecuted, even sentenced to death, by their fellow citizens. In response, they have developed a rich variety of conceptions of the individual's complex relation to society and a rich variety of ways of living and writing in the face of resentment.Course Descriptions: College of Arts and Sciences Topics Courses (COLL) 7 In this course students will be introduced to some central philosophical personalities, texts, problems, and methods. They will learn to discern philosophy in dialogues, plays, letters, treatises, and movies, and they will be invited to draw on their own creative talents in order to explore whether philosophical lives might be lived here and now and what such lives might be like. What are the unexamined assumptions of the society in which we live? How might we question those assumptions and might our conclusions challenge society's foundations? What role might philosophical questioning play in a contemporary democracy? Could we lead examined lives today? E 103 The Great Wall of China (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Atwood Why was the Great Wall of China built? What made the people of China and Mongolia so hostile that a vast wall had to be built to separate them? Is this wall a symbol of China's might and glory, or a symbol of tyranny like the Berlin Wall? Did the wall actually keep out the \"barbarians\"? Can it really be seen from the moon? For almost 2,000 years, how to handle the nomads of Mongolia was the most important foreign policy question for China's rulers. The wall thus came to symbolize the social, economic, military, political, and cultural clash between China and Mongolia. To understand this conflict, students will explore fundamental issues of international relations: Is conflict between different societies and cultures inevitable? Does greed always cause war or can economic interests be harnessed to make peace profitable? How much do domestic politics and ideology tie the hands of policy-makers confronting foreign threats? Can smaller powers make peace with larger neighbors without losing their independence and identity? In the final section of the class, we will look at the new \"great wall\" of barbed wire that along with contemporary Chinese colonization is fencing off the Inner Mongolian steppe. We will look at how the legacy of past conflicts along the Great Wall is shaping contemporary issues of environmental protection, minority rights, and land use. E 103 King Arthur of Britain\u2014The Once and Future Hero (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) McGerr Who was King Arthur? When and where do the narratives about him first appear? Is he a conquering hero or a tragic victim of internal conflict? What do the narratives of King Arthur have to do with the quest for the Holy Grail? What mythological, literary, and political forces have shaped representations of King Arthur in the past and in our own times? This course examines major narratives about King Arthur from medieval Europe and compares them to some of the representations of King Arthur in the literature and films of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Readings will include the medieval Welsh tale \"How Culhwch Won Olwen,\" selections from the medieval Latin chronicle History of the Kings of Britain, the medieval French tale The Knight of the Cart, selections from the medieval German tale Parzival , the medieval English tale Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, and the twentieth-century English novel The Sword in the Stone. Films studied will be Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1974), The Fisher King (1991), and The Mists of Avalon (2001). E 103 Language and Thought (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Franks This course examines the nature of human language from a variety of perspectives and explores the complex interrelationship between language and thought. It introduces students to current language-related issues in the social and behavioral sciences, addressing questions such as: How is human language structured? What does it mean to \"know\" a language? How is this knowledge acquired? What happens when linguistic ability is impaired? To what extent are language and thought independent? Is language a uniquely human capacity? How can human languages differ? What properties do they all share? What are sign languages? How do languages change? E 103 Power, Politics, and Piety: The Struggle for the Holy Land in Israel/Palestine (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Magid This course will examine the political situation in Israel/Palestine from historical, theological, and cultural perspectives, with special emphasis given to questions of nationalism and territorialism. We will read primary and secondary literature dealing with modern nationalism and territory, the concept of \"land\" in Judaism and Islam (using primary sources in translation), the history of Zionism and Palestinian nationalism, and the rise of the anti-nationalist Islamist movement, including its roots in British colonialism. We will explore the rise of nationalism in the Middle East more generally, including its secular, Marxist, and Islamist roots, and will read some classical and contemporary Zionist debates on bi-nationalism, militarism and territorial compromise, and the more contemporary discussion in Israel and Palestine in the media and in the academy. This is not a political science course\u2014we will not debate policy, legislation, and predictions for the future. Rather, we will examine the underlying theological and cultural roots of the political crisis founded on the relationship between territory and national identity. At the end of the semester we will turn to some political commentary on issues of territory and resolution including the Israel Declaration of Independence, Camp David II, the Hamas Charter, the Geneva Accords, and the Saudi Arabia Peace Plan. E 103 Quantum Mysteries for Everyone (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Hagar Quantum theory is the best theory we have of microscopic things, but it is also extremely hard to understand what exactly the theory is saying. We will begin this course by performing a few simple quantum experiments to see just why the theory is so strange, and then we will begin to look more closely at the philosophical puzzles raised by quantum theory and some proposed solutions to those puzzles. Along the way, we will study what people such as Einstein and Bohr have said on the matter, and we will learn how to think critically and carefully about science and scientific theories. The course will have both lecture and discussion. E 103 A Question of Love (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Mickel In this course we explore our understanding of the various emotions and relationships we cover by the word love. As a basis for understanding the different aspects of love in human relationships as represented in western tradition, we shall read and analyze an anthology of fundamental passages from several classical and medieval works ranging from Plato and the Bible to Ovid and the Romance of the Rose . We use our discussion of these texts to analyze the representations of love in two medieval romances, Chretien's Erec and Enide and Gottfried's Tristan; one seventeenth- and one eighteenth-century French novel, The Princess of Cleves and Dangerous Liaisons ; and an English novel by Jane Austen, Sense and Sensibility . E 103 Sacred Places (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Gruber In most parts of the world, religious activity is linked to specific places that have ritual, mythical, or historical significance. These \"sacred spaces\" become the focus of ritual activity, pilgrimage, and symbolism, and are usually endowed with buildings and art that celebrate the sanctity of the place, create a sense of awe, and accommodate the activities and people who travel to visit them. This course offers an introduction to a representative sample of significant sacred sites and shrines throughout the world. These holy places will be examined in terms of the festivals and religions with which they are associated: Egyptian, Greek, and Mesoamerican religions; Judaism; Christianity; Islam; Buddhism; Hinduism; and Shinto. We will consider why the selected sites became holy to certain peoples or civilizations, how the sites and structures convey a sense of transcendence and awe, how the structures were planned to accommodate assembled groups of persons and the attendant festivals and rituals, the nature of the processions of the faithful to them, the symbolic meaning of these sites, and whether their functions and significance have survived to the present day unaltered or in a reconfigured form. E 103 The Semiotics of Advertising (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Fowler Semiotics is the science of the sign: anything that functions in communication. In this course we apply semiotic methods to the study of advertising, which must communicate compellingly in a very short time or in a limited space. As a result, advertising is a perfect laboratory for the semiotic methodology because it must use signs very effectively. In fact, the finest advertising approaches poetry in its artistic subtlety and power. Semiotics is an extremely flexible tool that is useful in a wide range of academic fields. Readings are drawn primarily from an introductory textbook on semiotics, while most of the illustrative material used in lectures comes from video and print advertising. A Web page serves as an archive of all the ads viewed in the course lectures. Weekly assignments require students to answer questions based on the readings and to write brief annotations of ads found by each individual student. There is a midterm and a 8 University Division Guide 2008-2009 final exam, and students will write a term paper or course project exploring semiotic themes in advertising texts. E 103 What is Poetry? (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) McDowell This course invites the student to notice and assess a universal poetic impulse, that is, a thoroughly human tendency to create artistic verbal patterns in sound and sense. We challenge the notion that poetry exists mostly in literary tomes, instead pursuing a poetic impulse running through the verbal expressions of the world's peoples. Students initially develop a toolkit for identifying and describing poetic resources in everyday life. We turn this lens onto our own verbal environments to explore poetic elements in the stories and jests of \"ordinary\" conversation. Then we embark on a tour of oral poetry traditions in the Andes of South America, in West Africa, and in greater Mexico (including Mexican Americans). Our goal is to recognize and appreciate the techniques, uses, and functions of the poetic impulse in the lives of individuals and communities. E 103 Who Wrote the Bible? (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Marks More than any work of literature, sacred or profane, the Bible forces us to confront the problem of authorship. Who wrote the Bible? Was it Moses? Was it God? Was it a prophet or priest in the time of King David, or a college of scribes in exile in Babylonia? Or do readers themselves complete the writing of the texts they read? Traditional religious answers to the question of authorship have attempted to defend the Bible's unity. Modern critical answers, by contrast, stress the composite nature of even the smallest units (individual psalms, brief narrative episodes, and points of law). What does it mean in the age of relativity to entertain multiple, or even conflicting, viewpoints? The course has three principal aims: to explore the diversity of biblical writing, to introduce students to the excitement of literary analysis through exercises in close reading, and to test the role of the reader in the \"construction\" of literary meaning. Lectures and discussion sections will take up such topics as mythic origins, the relation of history-likeness to history, and the role of women in biblical narrative. Our readings will be drawn from many parts of the Bible\u2014particularly from the narrative sections of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament)\u2014augmented by brief selections from ancient Near Eastern and Hellenistic literature and from the history of biblical interpretation. Theological questions will be treated from a secular and critical perspective, but with respect for individual beliefs and for the diverse traditions of religious instruction. COLL-E 104 SOCIAL AND HISTORICAL STUDIES E 104 Brains and Minds, Robots and Computers (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) This course introduces topics in the cognitive sciences. As a survey course, it touches on all aspects of this interdisciplinary and rapidly evolving field. The course addresses topics such as the mind and brain, artificial intelligence, embodied cognition, cyborgs, robotics, social interactions and complex systems, the wisdom of crowds, social foraging, and the representation of knowledge. Special units may involve topics such as Mindstorms Robotics and video games in society. This course is not an explicit prerequisite for 200- and 300-level cognitive science courses, but it serves as an introduction to the field and is recommended for students who are considering a cognitive science major or minor. E 104 Eyes, Optics, Light, and Color: Studies of Vision from the Renaissance through the Twentieth Century (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Schickore Vision is one of the elementary processes of life, but at the same time deeply mysterious: how exactly does vision work? Can we really trust our eyes? What is the mind's role in seeing? Are our eyes passive receptors or active contributors to sensory perception? How do insects see? And how can we find out what our own eyes and brain are doing when we see? Anatomists and physiologists, philosophers of various stripes, psychologists, mathematicians, physicists, artists, and physicians have grappled with such questions. Beginning in the seventeenth century, this course will survey a wide range of approaches to the study of vision. We will examine what anatomists learned from dissecting eyes and physicians from pathologies of vision; how telescopes and microscopes revolutionized the understanding of perception; why philosophers cared about pure sensations; how painters employed the science of perspective to create visual effects; why physiologists became interested in kaleidoscopes and stroboscopes; and how all these endeavors have contributed to our understanding of this complex, elusive, and yet so basic activity: seeing. This course will integrate transformations in the study of vision with broader scientific, sociopolitical, and cultural changes in society. E 104 Global Consumer Culture (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Wilk Does everyone in the world wear Nike and eat at McDonalds? Is the planet going to become one big shopping mall, full of people who listen to the same music and watch the same movies? Or is the world entering a period of tribalism and fundamentalism as nations break apart and everyone scrambles for their own piece of territory? Scholars simply don't agree. We have to look at the evidence, listen to the arguments, and try to figure out what kind of world we will be living in during the next century. This course will examine the evidence for the spread of global consumer culture, looking at the ways that people around the world have learned to be consumers. We will ask the tough questions about the future, about the environmental impacts of consumption, and the way our own cups of coffee and running shoes tie us together with a whole globe of other producers and consumers. E 104 Indiana Dialects (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Botne Language differences are inevitable in a society composed of numerous social and ethnic groups. These differences in language serve as one of the most obvious indicators of social and regional variations. Consequently, they affect the impressions we have of those we meet around us every day. In this course students will consider what it means to talk about dialects in general and Indiana dialects in particular. One focus throughout the course will be the speech of young adults in Indiana: how it might be investigated, how it differs from that identified in other studies, and whether current dialect differences match former dialect boundaries. E 104 Language and Gender (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Trix In Language and Gender, we study how language affects our sense of ourselves as women or men. We also study how women and men use language differently. We will consider language and gender in written communications, including Internet postings, graffiti, letters of recommendation, and academic writing. But we will focus on language in face-to-face interaction. How do women and men talk in single-gender groups and in mixed-gender groups? What is the nature of these differences and what is their origin? We will also consider language and gender in different subcultures and cultures. Finally, we will study language and gender in specific contexts: in the home, in the classroom and university, in the business world, in science, and in the public arena. Overall, this course will make students more aware of the power of language to influence people, of the complexity of issues of language and gender in society, and of our growing ability to study these complexities. E 104 Lost Tribes and Sunken Continents (3 cr.) (Fall) (First eight weeks) (S&H) Pyburn This is a class about the mysteries of the past. During the semester several of the most intriguing ideas and questions about the behavior and experiences of ancient humans will be discussed, including the origin of the Moundbuilders, the story of Atlantis, ancient contacts with extraterrestrials, the fates of the Easter Islanders and the Maya, lost cities of the Inca, and the shroud of Turin. The point of covering this popular and sensational material is threefold. First, students will be introduced to the methods of science. Second, students will develop critical skills that will be useful in everyday life. Finally, students will learn to take an anthropological approach to identifying the cultural values promoted by particular claims about the human past. Students will be exposed to the basic principles of anthropology, the methodology of scientific archaeology, and the most exciting current archaeological research to develop an enlightened perspective on the importance of scientific research to life in the modern world. E 104 The Mad and the Bad (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Dwyer What are the problems of those with long-term mental illnesses? What happens when they get caught up in the criminal justice system? This course draws on materials from psychology, sociology, law, and criminal justice to answer these questions. It focuses first on the experience, diagnosis, and treatment of serious illnesses such as schizophrenia and then at how the criminal justice system responds to them. Course Descriptions: College of Arts and Sciences Topics Courses (COLL) 9 We pay special attention to how people move (and are moved) back and forth between jails and hospitals, prisons and psychiatric units, the community and social control institutions. Typically, students read several first-hand accounts of mental illness written by patients and those who care for them. We also read articles about the criminal justice system and the mentally ill, focusing on issues such as the insanity defense, police handling of the mentally ill, serial killers, and violent sexual offender legislation. COLL-E 105 NATURAL AND MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES E 105 Physics for Poets: Space and Time (3 cr.) (Fall) (N&M) Evans This course explores some of the biggest ideas in physics with an emphasis on their historical development, experimental verification, and impact on society as a whole. During this course we will follow the progression of our understanding of space and time from Aristotle to Einstein. E 105 Sister Species: Lessons from the Chimpanzee (3 cr.) (Fall) (N&M) Hunt This course surveys the natural sciences through studies of our closest relative\u2014our sister species, the chimpanzee. In the course of examining chimpanzee behavior, ecology, morphology, physiology, \"language,\" intelligence, genetics, and systematics, we will learn how the scientific method helps us understand the natural world. For anthropologists, chimpanzees are a particularly informative species because they are far enough removed from humans that we can examine them more objectively than we can examine ourselves, yet they are so closely related to us that much of what we learn about our sister species applies to us as well. Through films, labs, and writing assignments we will get an intimate look at every aspect of chimpanzees. FRESHMAN SEMINAR (FULFILLS TOPICS REQUIREMENT BUT FOR FRESHMEN ONLY): FALL COLL-S 103 ARTS AND HUMANITIES S 103 Leadership: Body, Mind, and Spirit\u2014 Lessons from the Aspen Idea (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Pugh To many Aspen connotes skiing, celebrities, and the rich. But what is really fascinating and worthy of study is the confluence of thought, creativity, and action that became known as the Aspen Idea. The concept was a cultural renaissance predicated on a philosophy of fusing and unifying mind, spirit, and body. Men from the Army's Tenth Mountain Division returned after World War II to develop recreational skiing. Faculty from the University of Chicago brought the Great Books and founded the Aspen Institute as a place to explore and develop leadership. Interaction with the majestic physical surroundings forged a spirit of individual centeredness and peak performance. Though different today than originally envisioned, the Aspen Idea still provides lessons in vision, leadership, and personal success. The goal of this seminar is to identify principles of leadership from the Aspen experience and to permit each participant to develop a personal leadership plan and foundation for achievement.

(S&H) Collins Living-Learning Center (CLLC) Many unique academic opportunities are featured at the CLLC, and participation in them is part of the center's community life. Collins offers seminars handpicked by a committee of students. The student-taught Q 199 Residential Learning workshop is mandatory for all freshmen entering Collins. In addition, all freshmen and sophomores are required to take a Collins seminar each year; juniors and seniors are encouraged to enroll in one Collins course a year. These courses encourage critical thinking, creative activity, and community building and are open to all IU students. Most Collins courses fulfill College of Arts and Sciences distribution requirements. See the Collins Website (www. indiana.edu/~llc) for more information. Q 199 Residential Learning Workshop (1 cr.) (Fall, Spring) Peer Instructors Small discussion groups consider topics relevant to the Collins community and engage your active participation in Collins programming. Required of all entering freshmen. L 100 The Art of Yoga (1 cr.) (Fall) (Second eight weeks) Hatha yoga is a living art that balances and refines each individual through breath and the practice of positions called asanas. The health of the body-systems and our emotional, intellectual, and spiritual development all benefit by even the simplest of practices. In this class students will learn a well-rounded practice of essential yoga asanas, guided by the breath. The class will also introduce students to understanding the body-systems, the principles of developmental movement, and sound body mechanics to increase the ability to move from the inside out and have a more accomplished and enjoyable practice. Yoga stimulates and refines all the senses, and we will use a variety of movement explorations, visual art, music, dance, and expository writing to refine our awareness and further our experience of the art of yoga. This class is appropriate for beginners and experienced practitioners who want to develop a deeper practice. L 100 Edible Wild Plants (1 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (Non-standard weeks) Bertuccio We will be spending time in the outdoors observing, learning, drawing, and collecting edible wild plants. Each session will be in a different location: woods, fields, wetlands, lawns, etc. We will have the opportunity to see where these plants are growing, what their needs are, and to collect and use them in recipes. Each session will result in a recipe booklet with its own artwork and recipes, tested and tasted by the group. L 100 Studio Practice with International Visiting Artist (2 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (Second eight weeks) In this course students have the opportunity to take a studio course with an international visiting artist residing at the Collins Living-Learning Center. The specific focus of the course will depend on the area of expertise of the visiting artist and will be announced. This artist is brought to IU through Collins and the Department of Fine Arts, where the visiting scholar will also teach a 3 credit theory course. L 200 Sex, Dreams, and Altered States (3 cr.) (Fall) Weinstein In this course we will explore fiction writing and develop our abilities to write about sex, dreams, and altered states of consciousness. These three subjects, inherent to life, are often left undiscussed and hence unexplored in fiction-writing classes. This course aims to help writers gain comfort and confidence in writing about these important aspects of life. It is often through these subjects that fictional characters come alive, plot is developed, and more complex themes/emotions emerge. We will read and write throughout the semester, producing short stories, sharing our work with the class, and learning how to edit each other's writing. No previous writing experience is necessary, only enthusiasm, creativity, and the willingness to fully engage in the art of fiction. L 210 Nexus: Intersections in Biology and Art (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Nava Art and biology may be two seemingly divergent fields of study; however, in many ways both overlap. In this course we will explore how and why art and biology are indelibly intertwined in our society. This course is meant to challenge historical and contemporary perceptions of the objective/subjective study of life and nature. Some issues we will examine include the relationship between artists and scientists, the co-evolution of art and biology, the diversity of life and the evolutionary process as an aesthetic, ethical issues in bioart, and the functional relationship between aesthetics and the natural world. This course offers a \"hands-on/ eyes-on\" experience of intersections in art and biology observed in our everyday lives: from architecture, advertising, and gardening to fashion and food. L 210 Puzzles: Play and Paradox (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Rowe Puzzles can be mechanical, mathematical, logical, or spiritual; they can lock up secrets or challenge us to higher achievement. Puzzles are everywhere these days, from The Da Vinci Code to the Sudoku craze. This course will explore the puzzle phenomenon as an entry point to the study of popular culture and a bridge to concepts in psychology and cognitive science. We will look at what kinds of puzzles are out there\u2014visual, mechanical, literary and linguistic, logical and mathematical\u2014see how they work and try making our own. We'll also look at representations of puzzles in literature, film, and other arts and consider what role puzzles play in the maintenance\u2014and disruption\u2014of power and other social structures. L 220 On Uncle Sam's Secret Service (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Baesler The world's second oldest profession fascinates and appalls Americans equally. Are activities like torture something, as President George W. Bush asserts, \"Americans don't do\"? What exactly have American intelligence agencies been doing? In this course we will examine how the United States developed the largest intelligence apparatus in the world. We will discuss the basic outlines of U.S. foreign policy since World War II and specific topics such as the spy wars with the Soviet Union, CIA covert operations in Iran and Guatemala, attempts to establish Congressional oversight over intelligence work, and the role of intelligence in the \"War on Terror.\" Some basic knowledge of U.S. history since 1945 is a prerequisite for success in this course. More important, however, successful completion depends on careful reading of the weekly assignments, active participation in class, and willingness to work in a small group throughout the semester.Course Descriptions: Communication and Culture (CMCL) 11 L 320 The Ecology of Eating (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Cafer du Plessis Recent expos\u00e9s such as Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma have drawn attention to the rise of factory farms in the Midwest, providing a glimpse of the region's agricultural and environmental history. This course provides an in-depth examination of historical documents and current scholarly writings on agriculture and the environment in the Midwest, from the pre-Columbian era to the present. Students will participate in a group research project by locating historical materials on Indiana agriculture and environment. The class will also interview guest speakers about their understandings of Indiana agricultural history. We will use our collective research to create a public Website featuring primary sources and student projects, such as essays or photographs. Most classes will consist of discussing a scholarly article or book chapter (25-35 pages per class meeting); analyzing historical documents; viewing film clips; interviewing guest speakers; student presentations; and group work on the research project. S103 Music: Mirror of the Moment (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Kerchner Come listen to punk rock and learn about the historical circumstances that led to its development. What historical events, as well as political, economic, and other factors, influenced the creation of genres like hardcore punk, pop-punk, and glam-punk? This is NOT a music history course. Instead we will examine the historical processes that gave way to the formation of particular music genres throughout American and British history. It is a fun opportunity to think about history not as the memorizing of important figures and dates but as a series of interconnected events that shape the development of human culture. You don't have to be a musician to enjoy this class. All you need is an open mind and an interest in learning about different types of music and the people who created them and enjoy them. This course is also approved for College of Arts and Sciences Topics credit (freshmen only).Communication and Culture (CMCL) C 121 Public Speaking (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) A contemporary course in the ancient and practical art of rhetoric founded on the premise that rhetorical action (including the focus of our course, public speaking) is public action. The course is designed to help you recognize situations in which your rhetorical action can contribute to the well-being of a community. C 121 provides you with the tools (both of speech composition and delivery) you need to responsibly prepare a variety of effective presentations. Each assignment and speech is an opportunity to engage a rhetorical situation in order to l) create an audience out of a collection of individuals; and 2) invite that audience to understand something in a particular way or motivate its members to help resolve some problem about which you think they should be concerned. C 122 Interpersonal Communication (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (S&H) This course is an introduction to interpersonal communication, examined from the intersecting perspectives of performance, power, and identity. Performance highlights our central concern with the practice of interpersonal communication in the conduct of social life, through which the most resonant symbols and beliefs of a society are embodied, enacted, and placed on display. You and your classmates will be asked to become ethnographers of interpersonal everyday conversation. You will observe and analyze interpersonal interactions in your own lives in the light of an array of communication concepts and theories. In the end, we will encourage you not only to analyze others' communication, but also to use the theoretical principles you learn to become more aware of how your interpersonal interactions with others are connected to broader questions of power and social identity. C 190 Introduction to Media (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (A&H) Striphas References to the power and prevalence of \"the media\" are commonplace. But what are \"the media\"? How do they work and for whom? As media increasingly pervade the fabric of daily life, and as fewer and fewer entities dominate media ownership, the urgency of asking and answering these questions only grows in importance. This course will introduce you to the basic vocabularies of visual and media literacy and hone your skills at critically analyzing media texts, institutions, apparatuses, and audiences. We will focus on four specific (and prevalent) media genres\u2014film, radio, television, and the Internet\u2014and our goal will be to explore the relationships between and among form, content, ownership, and meaning with respect to each. C 201 Race and the Media (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Explores the ways in which U.S. ideologies in particular historical periods have influenced the production, representations, and audiences' interpretations of media artifacts. Topics might focus on specific or various ethnic groups (e.g., African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, \"Whites\") and mainstream and/or alternative media. Screenings may be required. C 202 Media in the Global Context (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Surveys media industries, products, and publics outside the United States context (e.g., Asia, Africa, Europe, Latin America). Analyzes regional media in relation to local/global historical, economic, and social processes. C 203 Gender, Sexuality, and the Media (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Examines portrayals of women across various media outlets and diverse cultural regions. The course also considers women as producers and consumers of media products. Topics might focus on a specific medium (e.g., television, film, or the Internet), genre (e.g., soap operas, reality TV , anime), or region (United States, Africa, Asia). C 205 Introduction to Communication and Culture (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (A&H) Terrill This course will introduce you to the unique perspective on the study of communication provided by the combined interests and talents of the faculty in this department. This course also will prepare you for the work that will be expected in higher-level courses in the department in the areas of rhetoric and public culture, performance and ethnography, and film and media. Most important, this course encourages you to see that our social world, and the truths through which we define it, cannot exist outside of communication. In other words, it is through film, speech, and performance that we construct our world and ourselves. Understanding this perspective on communication enables students to become more productive participants in contemporary public culture. C 222 Democratic Deliberation (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) This course considers the challenge of participatory public discussion and decision making in our democracy. As such, this course is premised on the idea that individuals and groups are always bound up in public institutions and vocabularies that both constrain action and provide possibilities for action. C 223 Business and Professional Communication (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (S&H) Our lives are shaped in ways seen and unseen by organizational and institutional forces. This course examines some of the vectors along which those forces are communicated. Some of the primary questions addressed include: What is the relationship between individuals and institutions/organizations? How are our behaviors and attitudes influenced by these structures? How are we addressed by organizational structures and how do we in turn address them?12 University Division Guide 2008-2009 C 228 Argumentation and Public Advocacy (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) Lucaites Practical introduction to the use of reasoning and evidence in argumentation. Develops skills that are useful in becoming a productive citizen and that are essential for achieving success in upper-division courses across the university. C 229 Ways of Speaking (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H)C 290 Hollywood I (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Anderson This course is an introductory survey, suitable for both majors and nonmajors. The class is appropriate for anyone who has an interest in the movies and modern history. The course offers a historical survey of the American motion picture and entertainment industry from its beginnings to 1948. It shows how Hollywood evolved as both an art form and a business. Students are expected to attend lectures and screenings of about 15 representative films, including the work of such major directors as D. W. Griffith, Alfred Hitchcock, and Billy Wilder. C 292 Hollywood II (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) Anderson See the Web for description: www.indiana.edu/~deanfac/class.html.

(A&H) This course helps students with any major develop their skills in reading and interpreting literary texts and in articulating their responses through written assignments and class discussion format. Students usually complete five short writing projects based on the texts discussed, for a total of 20-25 pages. C 145 and C 146 each fulfill half of the English composition requirement when the student also registers for the 1 credit hour of ENG-W 143. There are no additional class meetings or assignments in addition to those of C 145 and C 146. C 145 Major Characters in Literature (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Topic for Fall 2008: Dysfunctional Families. They put the funk in dysfunctional. Get ready to feel really good about your own family as we dive into a semester of sibling rivalry, emotional baggage, dirty secrets, childish adults, and precocious children. All sections will read Euripides' Hippolytus , Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus , and Kafka's Metamorphosis . Each section will read additional works unique to that section that may include short stories, poetry, novels, and drama. Individual sections may also include television, art, music, and film.

(Fall, Spring) (A&H) Pao, Halloran College Intensive Writing course. Introduction to basic concepts of literary criticism through comparative, close readings of texts from a variety of literary genres\u2014fiction, poetry, drama, essay\u2014from diverse traditions. C 216 Science Fiction, Fantasy, and the Western Tradition (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) In this historical and comparative survey of science fiction narrative from H. G. Wells to The X-Files, we will trace the origins of this important genre in narratives of exploration, imperialism, and anthropology through its twentieth-century representations of space and time travel, biotechnology and eugenics, utopias and dystopias, thinking machines and human prosthetics, knowledge networks, and retro-futures. Science fiction has been called \"the twentieth century's most characteristic genre,\" and one goal will be to understand its relevance to our own culture, particularly by considering science fiction novels, movies, and television in light of political and social change. C 219 Romance and the Western Tradition (3 cr.) (Spring) (A&H) C 251 Lyrics and Popular Song (3 cr.) (Spring) (A&H) C 252 Literary and Television Genres (3 cr.)

(Fall, Spring) (A&H) Intensive Writing in fall . How do a writer, a painter, and a composer represent a landscape, or silence? Is an advertisement a work of art? What do a romantic painting, poem, and symphony have in common? Can one translate a painting into a poem? How does one compare works of art created in different media, and why do we do it? What do we listen for in music or look for in a painting or a short story? These are the kinds of questions discussed in C 255, which deals with interrelations between literature, painting, and music during the past 200 years. Among the works studied are compositions by Mozart, Berlioz, Stravinsky, and John Cage; poems or stories by Coleridge, Flaubert, Joyce, Gertrude Stein, and Anne Sexton; and paintings by Delacroix, Courbet, Monet, Van Gogh, Kandinsky, and Mondrian. C 257 Asian Literature and Other Arts (3 cr.) (Spring) (A&H) C 261 Introduction to the Literatures of Africa (3 cr.) (Fall) (First eight weeks) (A&H) Meets with AAAD-A 297.

(Fall, Spring) (Nonmajors) (N&M) This course is centered on problem- solving techniques in computer environments. It teaches general problem-solving principles by applying them within particular software applications, such as word processing, Web browsing, and spreadsheets. The class is intended for students with little or no practical computing experience. The major objective is to acquire not only the skills of handling today's software tools, but also to gain the ability to learn new software applications as they emerge. In addition to providing instruction for each of the software applications, the lectures will examine how the computer and its various components operate and introduce some of the social and cultural implications of widespread computer use. Credit given for only one of CSCI-A 106, A 110, A 111. A 201 Introduction to Programming I (4 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (Nonmajors) (N&M) P: Two years of high school algebra or MATH-M 014 . Intended for students of all backgrounds and majors (except computer science) who desire a more sophisticated introduction to computers than is given in the 100-level \"A\" courses. No previous computer experience is assumed. Creative thought and expression are required. Students should be self-motivated since computer time outside of a structured class is necessary to complete the assignments. Although help is readily available from student assistants associated with the course, the material is best learned when students reason a solution for themselves. The course emphasizes programming style and methodology. User-interface design, program-ming style, and problem-solving strategies are stressed throughout. Functional decomposition Course Descriptions: East Asian Languages and Cultures (EALC) 13 is introduced early and is a central theme. By the end of the course, students are able to write programs using arrays, files, and classes. Programs are written in Java, the language favored for Web applications.

These adjectives are still used by some to describe China, Japan, and Korea, but more often we now hear others: modern, (almost) democratic, dynamic, high-tech, and urban. To what extent did East Asia formerly fit the first group of adjectives and to what extent does it now fit the latter? This course provides a broad overview of East Asia from its earliest recorded history up to the early twenty-first century. Areas covered include these countries' social structures, arts, economies, and politics. In addition to looking at their internal developments, we consider the effect that East Asia and the rest of the world have had on each other. Readings are from a textbook, literature, a short autobiography, and the popular media. Assignments include two short papers, a midterm, and a final.

COMPOSITION COURSES W 131 Elementary Composition (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) Staff W 131 is a course in academic writing that attempts to integrate critical reading, thinking, and writing about phenomena and issues in our culture. Rather than practicing a set of discrete skills or often unrelated modes of discourse, the course aims to build sequentially on students' ability to read both written and cultural texts closely and critically and analyze those texts in ways that engage and problematize students' own experience, the perspectives of \"experts,\" and the world they live in. Students will be given six major writing assignments, including rough drafts. Faculty from many disciplines, including English, agree that students' performance in their courses would be greatly enhanced if they \"just knew how to analyze.\" Too often, they report, students stop short of analysis by 1) merely recycling what they view as unquestionably true facts or the received conclusions of their sources; 2) simply agreeing or disagreeing with what they understand to be just another opinion; or 3) offering a personal response to a text, phenomenon, issue, or concept that fails to problematize that position or connect it to any significant bigger picture. W131 aims to show students how the use of sources, agreement/ disagreement, and personal response can be made to serve independent, purposeful, well-supported analytical writing.Course Descriptions: English (ENG) 15 W 170 Projects in Reading and Writing (3 cr.)

Rowling. Matt Groening. Steven Hawking. A recent list of \"living geniuses\" offered these (and many other) names, citing them for their paradigm shifting, popular acclaim, intellectual power, achievement, and cultural importance. But what is a genius? And how do you become one? In this class, we'll think about the evil genius, the mad genius, the boy (and girl) genius, and the living genius, among others. Who do you consider a genius? Da Vinci? Shakespeare? Einstein? We'll read a variety of works, from the Romantics (who made artistic genius a central concept), to the modernists (who shared the fascination with genius), to more recent work that might include the online comic Girl Genius , Dave Eggers' memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius , the film A Beautiful Mind , and a self- help book How to Think Like Leonardo Da Vinci: Seven Steps to Genius Every Day.

Nightlife has been denounced, celebrated, and romanticized; legislated, protested, and reformed; written, acted, and sung. This course will take the time and space of the night as a way to introduce the concerns of humanistic study and pose questions about the uses and possibilities of literature, film, visual art, and performance. We will examine how writers, artists, and performers have imagined nightlife\u2014its people and places, its sounds and sights, its ethics and values, its comforts and fears. What themes and issues become most clear in the darkness of nightfall? What activities and practices flourish while most people slumber? What are the genres, settings, and characters that make up the literature of nightlife? How does nightlife contribute to the formation of communities and identities? What goes on after hours, either in the saloons and nightclubs of the city or in the dreamscapes of our minds? CREATIVE WRITING COURSES W 103 Introductory Creative Writing (3 cr.)

(Fall, Spring) (A&H) Johnson In modern media, many new ways of spreading and reinforcing folk belief and other kinds of folklore have evolved, but a new term, popular culture , also describes these new forms. The difference between folklore and popular culture is sometimes difficult to determine, but it seems that folklore exists in nonstandardized multiple variation, while forms of popular culture exhibit multiple variation that is standardized. Though topics that interest folklore scholars appear on film and video, the presentation of such topics are standardized (unchanged) in that they are \"frozen\" onto their medium. This course will deal with a number of issues of folk belief and worldview reinforced, debated, propagated, and spread by film and video, and it will explore whether folklore is really altered by standardization. This class assists students in developing skills for thinking critically about a wide variety of folk belief common in our times, and encourages them to appreciate the great variety of folk beliefs that exist in the world around them.

B 200 History of Jerusalem: Three Faiths, Three Thousand Years (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) Warhman B 204 Medieval Heroes (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Shopkow Well, heroes are fun, aren't they? But a society's heroes can tell you a lot about that society. (Can you imagine Rambo or Forrest Gump being heroes in any society but modern America?) So heroes are a great way to learn about past societies. This course is an introduction to the history of the Middle Ages in Western Europe through its heroes. What made people heroes in the Middle Ages? Who can be a hero? Who can become a heroine? How did changes in medieval society create changes in people's thinking about heroes? And how do modern people see these medieval heroes? A mix of figures have been chosen to represent the three periods of the Middle Ages. There are all kinds of heroes: saints, outlaws, kings, and legends. We'll look at what was going on when their stories were written and why they became significant heroes. There will be a textbook, Barbara Rosenwein's Short History of the Middle Ages , and each week we will read one primary source reading because a central goal of the course is to develop the ability to understand how different kinds of primary sources differ from each other and to begin to approach them the way an historian would. This course is also approved for College of Arts and Sciences Topics credit. B 226: Mafia and Other Italian Mysteries (3 cr.)

(Fall) (S&H) Dierks This course provides a topical introduction to American history from the era of Columbus's exploration of the \"New World\" up through the era of the American Civil War. As our guiding themes, we will focus on cultural tensions between freedom and unfreedom, equality and inequality, and prosperity and poverty. Has it ever, for example, been possible in American history to imagine \"equality\" without at the same time excluding some people? In examining such cultural tensions, we will look in particular at how notions of gender, class, and race have changed over time, first in a \"colonial\" context when European peoples sought to transfer ideals and practices to the challenging new environment of North America, and then in a \"postcolonial\" context when competing social groups struggled for position in the young American nation. Throughout the course, we will situate North America and then the United States not only in a multicultural but also in a global context. Reading assignments feature \"primary source\" documents written by people in the past; writing assignments entail three short papers and a take-home final exam. H 105 American History I (3 cr.)

Looking closely at the evolution of American social structure, culture, and politics, we will analyze such topics as the emergence of consumer culture, the rise and fall of segregation, the shifting meanings and influence of liberalism and conservatism, the origins and end of the Cold War, and the concept of a post-Cold War, post-industrial, post-modern nation. H 106 American History II (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) Wu H 205 Ancient Civilization (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) Watts H206 Medieval Civilization (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) Deliyannis H 211 Latin American Culture and Civilization I (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Diaz This course is part one of a two-course sequence on the history of Latin America from pre-conquest times to the present. It will survey the history of Latin America from its first inhabitation to the independence period in the nineteenth century. Five major themes will be addressed: the development of the great Amerindian civilizations, the encounter between Europeans and Amerindians, the making of a colonial society in Spanish America and Brazil, the struggles leading to the collapse of colonial rule, and the civil wars of independence. The overriding concern of this survey is to provide an understanding of how the complex interaction between the different cultures that met in the Americas shaped these colonial societies and how some elements of this legacy persisted and/or were transformed by different social groups before and after independence. This knowledge of colonial Latin America will help us interpret and understand firsthand accounts of this period, pivotal skills that we should cultivate in order to critically analyze any current event in Latin America, the United States, or the rest of the world. Meets with LTAM-L 210. H212 Latin American Culture and Civilization II (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) Diaz32 University Division Guide 2008-2009 H 213 The Black Death (3 cr.)

Students will be graded on the basis of short writing assignments and tests. Readings are drawn from general textbooks on Jewish history and more specific readings on select topics. H 252 Jewish History: Spanish Expulsion to Present (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) Lehmann W 200 War and Culture, 1700-2007 (3 cr.) (Spring) (S&H) Guardino History and Philosophy of Science (HPSC) X 100 Human Perspectives on Science (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) This course is an introduction to the study of science as a human activity. No specific background knowledge of science is presupposed. Issues such as the following are addressed: What is distinctive about scientific reasoning? How did science develop? How do science and technology affect our lives? Each section of X 100 deals with a different topic, and topics may vary each semester. X 100 may be repeated once with a different topic. X 102 Revolutions in Science: Plato to NATO (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) At critical junctures in the past, the ideas and productions of scientists have radically changed the way we've come to view nature, our bodies, and our lives. These changes have been intellectually profound and socially dramatic. Historians often refer to them as scientific revolutions. This course is about such revolutions in Western science. We will consider several so-called \"revolutionary\" episodes, examining how (or if) the idea of a \"revolution\" can be applied to each. To get a better sense of the nature, origins, and impact of these \"revolutionary\" ideas, we will also examine the history of what occurred during these periods of great scientific and social change. For example, we'll look at the impor-tance of economic changes, political movements, and the role of women in the history of science. X 123 Perspectives on Science: Social and Historical (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Individual sections will vary in content and major themes, but all will employ case studies from the history of science to examine the intellectual, cultural, and social impact of science in historical perspective. May be repeated once for credit with different topic. X 200 Scientific Reasoning (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (N&M) People have used scientific arguments to support a variety of claims. Some of these claims seem like common sense to us now, such as the claims that the earth goes around the sun or that germs cause disease. Others still cause heated disputes, such as those about the human origins of global warming, the relative danger of toxic waste incineration, or the dietary benefits of oat bran. The objective of this course is to develop the skills necessary to understand and evaluate scientific reasoning. These skills include identifying the goals of scientific reasoning and recognizing how science manages to succeed or fail at reaching those goals. We will examine both the general features of a good argument and the specific techniques of argumentation used in science. We will pay attention to particular issues such as the use and misuse of statistics and experiments. Examples of scientific reasoning will be drawn from historical sources, current public controversies, and the work of actual scientists. No knowledge of science or mathematics beyond the high school level is assumed. X 220 Issues in Science: Humanistic (3 cr.)

We will read texts and secondary literature from the three traditions chronologically. We will use Genesis 22 as an occasion to talk about Jewish, Christian, and Muslim methods of exegesis, as well as more general issues and methods in comparative religion. The hope is that this course will serve to widen students' understanding of their own religious traditions in light of and in spite of another tradition that shares its scripture. Moreover, it will enable students to become more intimately familiar with another tradition's use of the Bible as the foundation for its religious identity. R 153 Religions of the East (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (A&H) This course is an introduction to the major religious traditions of South and East Asia; Hinduism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Daoism, and Shinto. Religion in South and East Asia has influenced the intellectual climate of these regions as extensively as it has in the West. The understandings of self, society, and cosmos that religious traditions transmit affect many aspects of culture, including art, literature, economics, and politics. Despite sturdy claims of continuity, however, these understandings vary considerably, depending on place and time. We will examine some of the outstanding texts, concepts, places, events, practices, and people involved in each of these traditions. There are no prerequisites for taking this course. R 160 Religion and American Culture (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Brown How does religion influence American culture, and how does American culture shape religion?

We begin by examining basic methods and tools in ethics, after which we will examine six topics: abortion, war and peace, death and dying in medicine, economic justice, discrimination, and environmental ethics . The chief goal of the course is to explore the complexity of these topics and to understand how religious thought, belief, and practice inform moral discussion in American public life today. Along the way, we will ask whether individuals or groups have a responsibility to protect the interests of vulnerable, or \"at-risk,\" populations: fetuses, political communities under attack, women in the economic and cultural marketplace, sick and dying patients, the poor, racial minorities, and nonhuman lives. These groups, and the issues that surround their needs, stand at the center of debates in public culture today. With each topic we will examine different arguments and points of view. We will close the semester by studying some religious themes that inform most of the readings, focusing on creation and covenant. Sources draw from Judaism, Christianity, and contemporary social thought. R 204 Introduction to Religions in Africa (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Schulz The class introduces students to the diversity of religious thought and practice in Africa.

(Fall, Spring) (A&H) Nance This course offers a broad overview of Buddhist ideas and practices, from their origins in India to their later expansions into other parts of Asia (and their more recent incursions into Europe and the Americas). The course has two main aims: first, to familiarize you with Buddhism as it has taken shape in various historical and cultural settings; second, to invite you to think carefully and critically about Buddhist ideas and practices and what they imply for those who espouse and engage in them. In pursuit of these aims, we will investigate a wide range of primary sources in translation, together with additional texts (and a few films) that will help you to contextualize and understand this material. No previous knowledge of Buddhism is required. This course is approved for College of Arts and Sciences Topics course credit. R 257 Introduction to Islam (3 cr.) (Fall) (A&H) Jacques The class will examine the Islamic tradition from the perspective of the history of religions. This means that the class will serve the dual purpose of examining the external history of Islamic institutions and society and how Muslims and Islamic scholars have internally understood their tradition, and the faith, over time. We will attempt to represent the range of attitudes and ideas that have been current in the tradition from the seventh century to the present. The course will begin by examining Islam in the \"core areas\" of the Islamic world, primarily the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. However, as we move through the course we will begin to look at Islam \"on the periphery,\" primarily in Indonesia (the world's largest Muslim country) and the United States. We will particularly focus on those elements in Islamic history that continue to have importance for how contemporary Muslims understand their tradition and how they (in all of their plurality) hope to see Islam develop in the future.

S 101 Social Problems and Policies (3 cr.) (Fall) (S&H) Cornell Topic: Envisioning the City. Houses, roads, school buildings, street trees, shopping malls, interstate highways, hedges: all of these elements make up what scholars of urban planning, architecture, landscape architecture, and the environment call \"built environment.\" You will learn how to identify the various components of the built environment, how to analyze them, and how to use the knowledge you gain through this analysis to design landscapes that respond to specific social problems. Because this is a studio-style course, you will spend your time visiting sites in Bloomington, drawing maps and graphs of those sites, analyzing yours and others' work, and presenting your work in class. Two of the three portfolio projects involve designing new environments for those sites that respond to specific social problems. S 101 Social Problems and Policies (3 cr.)

This course will provide an overview of the history of Asian Americans in the United States in order to situate their experiences within broader social and historical contexts and to highlight the diversity of Asian American communities and families. In addition, we will discuss contemporary issues of immigration, assimiliation, education, community, and identity among Asian Americans. S 101 Social Problems and Policies (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Pescosolido Topic: Medicine in America: Physicians, Patients, and Their Problems. The United States has the costliest health care system in the world, yet it is criticized for its failure to cure society's ills such as cancer, heart disease, and AIDS. When people do get sick, many do not have the financial means to pay for needed services, or they may receive inferior care because of their inability to pay for more effective but costly treatment. All of these issues deal with health and medical care that all of us experience in one form or another. This course explores basic questions about a wide range of topics dealing with the providers of care, the recipients of care, and the larger context of health, illness, and disease. What is health? What is illness? Who is most likely to get ill? How are race, ethnicity, and social class related to the experience of illness? How do people seek care, and what factors lead some to see a doctor soon after experiencing symptoms while others wait until they must seek emergency services? What are \"alternative\" medical systems, and who uses such treatments as acupuncture, chiropractic, and homeopathy? How do physicians decide who will live and who will die? S 101 Social Problems and Policies (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Vonderhaar Topic: Media and Society. The link between media and society is nowhere more evident than on the pages of a newspaper. In fact, the parts of a paper\u2014the layout\u2014actually reflect the key components of the social structure. Major sections are fully devoted to certain social institutions: politics, the economy, the justice system, the family, religion, education, and, of course, sports. Studying the relationship between the media and society is challenging and extends far beyond the scope of this course. While we will not limit our imaginations in an examination of media and society, we will divide our attention into three main areas. First, we will consider ideas about how the media influences society. Second, we will examine specific relationships between the media and three institutions: politics, the law, and business (advertising). Finally, we will look at the relationship between the media and popular culture (television, movies, and music). S 110 Charts, Graphs, and Tables (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (N&M) Social scientists attempt to better understand the social world. Almost always, numbers are used to illustrate and convey relationships interesting to researchers. These numbers must be presented in an accessible and interpretable fashion. Charts, graphs, and tables are effective ways to present empirical results. At each stage in the research process, errors can be made, accidentally or purposefully, that ultimately may lead to inappropriate and/or misleading results and conclusions. This course will prepare you to be a knowledgeable and critical consumer of research findings. Perhaps more important, you will also become a good producer of scientific knowledge. This is not a math course. Rather, it is a class that focuses on quantitative reasoning. Throughout the semester we will focus less on the mathematics behind producing numbers and more on the underlying logic of the mathematical procedures. Accordingly, you will learn some elementary statistical techniques, how and when to use them, and various techniques available for presenting your results. Finally, you will apply what you have learned and be able to make correct conclusions about aspects of our social world. S 210 The Economy, Organizations, and Work (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring) (S&H) Explores the transformation of capitalism and industrialized societies; the evolution of organizations such as corporations, government agencies, educational systems, and others; and the changing world of work.

Explores the economic basis of social class, education and culture, social mobility, and social inequality in comparative and historical perspective. S 230 Society and the Individual (3 cr.) (Fall, Spring, Summer) (S&H) This course examines the influence of society on the individual's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Specifically, we will examine social influences on a person's attitudes toward self (identity and self-concept) and toward others (stereotypes, prejudices) and the ways in which those attitudes can be changed. We will examine how society structures the values, health, and satisfaction of its members. We will study the social origins of emotions such as love and anger and patterns of interpersonal attraction. We will examine aspects of small groups that promote conflict or cooperation and the ways in which group members jockey for status and power. Students will obtain a basic foundation in social psychological theory and findings that can be applied to their own lives as well as to further study of topics such as deviance, socialization, interpersonal relationships, and community.
