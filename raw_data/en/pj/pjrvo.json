This i s represented in funded programmatic research and numerous articles published on the Harlem Hospital Injury Prevention Program which resulted in a national model on community -based interventions. This work also led to policy directions and statements from the American Academy of Pediatrics and other organizations. Mental Health Integration in Primary Care Settings - My research in this field has extended to a regional survey assessment of training needs (survey study); an educational intervention with be fore and after control design; a quality improvement project on the integration of mental screening and follow -up in the NY tri -state area; and a feasibility assessment of a web -based portal for parent pre-visit questionnaire. (See grants portfolio) This work led to a statewide effort by OMH (Project Teach) to train primary care physicians in the assessment and treatment of mental health disorders in children (see publication, 2014). This work has recently also continued with the receipt of the AmeriCare s and Friends of Children grants following Hurricane Sandy. Publications in this area include policy briefs, peer-reviewed work of the AAP mental health task force and original research on mental health screening in high risk populations such as children at risk for child maltreatment. Other studies in children's mental health in primary care include a study w hich tests the impact of the Multiple Family Group on child mental health and on various parent and family -level outcomes. Specifically, this proj ect's overall goal was to train a general academic pediatric clinician -researcher with special emphasis on children's mental health (MH) services research. The sub research study question involves validation of the Strengths and Difficulties functional as sessment scale in the group of children enrolled in MFG. Adolescent Behavior - my research in the 1990s focused of predictors of adolescent sexual behaviors. This involved the use of the Health Belief Model in predicting consistent condom use to protec t against pregnancy and HIV/AIDS/STI. The research also involved a quasi -experimental design testing a pregnancy prevention computer -assisted intervention in Harlem adolescents. Child Abuse Research and Education - I have been involved in child abuse p rogram development and evaluation for over two decades and have published in this area. Most recently, I am funded by NICHD /NIMH in a project entitled Stop, Look and Listen: Separating Fact from Fiction in Evaluation Cases of Child Abuse : An Interactive L earning tool for Pediatricians. Phase I of this research involve d the development of a prototype educational tool to support clinician decision in reporting of suspected child abuse and neglect. Phase II application has refine d the prototype and expand ed to six case and has included a preliminary evaluation . A separate project which originated from this initial one examines the role of implicit bias in the identification and reporting of child abuse by mandated reporters. An MOC part 2 as well CME accr editation is being sought. 20 Most recently, at Upstate Medical University, Dr. Ann Botash applied and was granted ACGME accreditation for a Child Abuse Fellowship. Laraque -Arena serves as a Research Mentor for this fellowship - only the second such fello wship in New York State - following the one founded at Maimonides Medical Center. Policy - Policy implications and statements compose a large part of my scholarly portfolio. The policy realms covered include health care delivery models, child abuse, in jury prevention , and adolescent health risk behaviors. The focus of most of the policy papers related to underserved populations. In March 2011 I was nominated and accepted to be a member of the Institute of Medicine Committee on Integrating Primary Ca re and Public. This committee was charged with examining ways to better integrate public health and primary care to assure healthy communities. The areas of focus include d cardiovascular disease inclusive of obesity, tobacco use, other risk factors as we ll as additional topics relevant to health disparities or specific populations. Cross -cutting issues such as behavioral health are included. I also participated in the IOM meeting Next Steps for Implementing the IOM Epilepsy Report: A Decision -Making To ol for People with Epilepsy and Their Families. In the past two years as President of SUNY Upstate Medical University and Health System CEO I was appointed by the NYS Governor, Andrew Cuomo to be the co -chair the Central New York Regional Economic Develop ment Council (2016 -present; one of ten regional economic development regions in New York State); and April 23, 2018 I was appointed by the Governor to be co -chair of statewide Maternal Mortality Task Force . Training - The major goal of the multiple training grant s that I have obtained from 2002 -2010 has been to train generalist specialists in pediatrics and internal medicine with a focus o n underserved communities and thematic emphasis on Healthy People 2010 objectives (mental health, child abuse, respi ratory diseases such as asthma, nutrition and overweight, environmental health) . All fellows have obtained a Masters in Public Health and have been mentored to carry out and publish a research project addressing key morbidity and mortality areas and areas of health promotion and disease prevention. The curriculum has also emphasized the development of strong teaching skills using adult learning theory. In 2011, I established the Pediatric Specialty Consultation Service sponsored by Maimonides Medical Center at the Maimonides Infants & Children's Hospital of Brooklyn and the corresponding child abuse pediatrics fellowship in collaboration with N ew York University . Maimonides Graduate Medical Education Committee has approved both a new child abuse fellows hip and a NICU fellowship in collaboration with NYU. The Child Abuse Fellowship was accredited 7/1/2011 and the first fellow began training. The NICU fellowship has rotated the six NYU fellows (one supported by MMC) through the MMC Regional Perinatal Cent er. In 2012, the Endocrine Division of MMC established the first MMC sponsored Pediatric Endocrine Fellowship . The Division of Cardiology continues with a Cardiology Fellowship in collaboration with NYU.

Clinicians' Experience of Care for the Sex -Trafficked Adolescent: A Qualitative Analysis. Poster Session, Pediatric Academic Societies, Baltimore, MA. USA; May 3, 2016. Educational Philosophy: I have been teaching medical students , resident s, fellows , and interdisciplinary trainees inclusive of master , doctoral and postdoctoral trainees , and faculty for o ver thirty years. My goal in teaching is to invite a spirit of inquiry, which invites innovative thought and creative interaction with the purpose of improving clinical care and translating new knowledge to practice. Attention to detail , based on a strong fund of knowledge , supported by self -directed learning , is a core value. This is then bolstered by the interaction brought about by team -based learning that instill s a yearning for an intellectual and inquisitive approach to clinical care , education, and research . This approach is also applicable to advocacy efforts that can be based on theory and evidence -based approaches. Service -learning is an example of an approach th at is contextual ly relevant and promotes the application of sound community - based a pproaches . In addition, community -based participatory research is integral to service learning. It is essential for trainees and life -long learners to understand the ever-changing medical literature, to critique it and specifically apply it to different patient populations. These tenets have served me well in all venues - whether in the 80 -90s in Central Harlem, Upper East Side/ East Harlem (2000) or Brooklyn, 59 NY (2010 -2016 ) and now at the State University of New York, Upstate Medical University (2016 - present) . At my newest leadership level as President of SUNY Upstate Medical University in Syracuse, these same principles are applied to an academic mission to achieve health equity.
