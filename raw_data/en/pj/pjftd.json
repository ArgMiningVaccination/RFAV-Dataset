The pandemic robbed families of loved ones and jobs, while exposing longstanding inequities in health care. With the killing of George Floyd\u2014one in a sequence of Black lives ended and upended\u2014injustice, racism, and deep-rooted flaws in our society were laid bare. Pain and anger are ongoing. This tumult, as uncomfortable as it feels, shows us how far we need to go. To quote a non-surgeon (the actor Will Smith), \"Racism isn't getting worse, it's getting filmed.\" This is an inflection point, for us as individuals and in our chosen field of surgery. Who will we choose to be at this moment in history? Structural racism has been the lived experience of members of our own department, and many of our patients. Massachusetts experienced one of the earliest and most severe Covid-19 outbreaks in the country, and as a safety-net hospital treating patients from underserved communities, at Boston Medical Center (BMC) we quickly saw that communities of color were hit hard by the pandemic. As an institution and a department that places a high priority on health equity, social justice, and promoting the dignity of all, at BMC we must continue to challenge the status quo on behalf of our patients. But we need to go further, continually challenging and rechallenging our own implicit biases, in our everyday lives, at work, and even in our research. What was previously deemed acceptable may not be now. It has been beyond inspiring to see the dedication and resolve of all of the frontline caregivers (backed up by many, many others) at BMC who have faced down this ruthless virus. Our SICU intensivists, residents, advanced practice providers, and critical care nurses went above and beyond week after long week to pull patients through the fight of their lives. And with elective surgeries canceled, surgeons in the department were determined to help in any way they could. A Covid-19 Procedure Team was quickly formed to lighten the load for their BMC colleagues, stretched thin by an inpatient Covid-positive census that topped 230 at the height of the crisis. Lives were saved. Like all hospitals, BMC was in a constant search to acquire PPE. Friends of the department and of the hospital were extremely generous, and in addition to philanthropy, came through with masks, N95 respirators, and many donated meals. We are immensely grateful! The pandemic also launched us on a learning curve as we implemented telehealth appointments, allowing us to conserve PPE and shield patients and providers from unnecessary exposure to the virus. I believe that this change in the way we have always delivered care will ultimately be beneficial for all. If 2020 sets us in the Boston University School of Medicine/BMC Department of Surgery on a path to tackle inequities in patient care and in academic surgery, then we will have achieved something significant in this life-altering and very difficult year. The stress we feel today will build the strength we wield tomorrow. Let's hold each other to that transformation.

Tseng, MD, MPH James Utley Professor and Chair of Surgery, Boston University School of Medicine Surgeon-in-Chief, Boston Medical Center Introduction Boston Medical Center The Department of Surgeryoston Medical Center (BMC) is a private, not-for-profit, 514-bed, academic medical center. BMC is the largest safety-net hospital and busiest trauma and emergency services center in New England. Located in Boston's historic South End, BMC is the primary teaching hospital of the Boston University School of Medicine and was created by the 1996 merger of Boston City Hospital (founded in 1855) and Boston University Medical Center Hospital (founded in 1864). BMC operates 66 residency training programs, with 711 resident and fellowship positions. BMC, a recognized leader in groundbreaking medical research, is the 13th largest recipient of funding from the National Institutes of Health among independent hospitals. The hospital currently oversees 617 research and service projects separate from research activities at Boston University School of Medicine. he Department of Surgery has a long, proud history, with roots that extend back more than 150 years. In 1873, Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) opened its doors, combining the New England Female Medical College with the medical staff of the Massachusetts Homeopathic Hospital. The modern history of the Department of Surgery at Boston University dates to 1946, when Dr. Reginald H. Smithwick was recruited from Massachusetts General Hospital to serve as Surgeon-in-Chief and Chair of Surgery at BUSM. Dr. Smithwick served in those positions for nearly 20 years. Among the surgeons who have led and contributed to the international stature of the Department of Surgery throughout the ensuing decades are Drs. Richard Egdahl, John Mannick, Lester Williams, Peter Mozden, Robert Hobson, Edward Spatz, James Becker, and Gerard Doherty. In July 2017, Jennifer F. Tseng, MD, MPH, was recruited as Chair and James Utley Professor of Surgery at BUSM and Surgeon-in-Chief at Boston Medical Center (BMC). The Department of Surgery comprises 14 divisions, or sections, and includes 62 faculty members. A well- established relationship with Boston Children's Hospital provides shared faculty in pediatric critical care and pediatric general surgery, as well as pediatric training for residents. The department also has affiliated faculty members from Roger Williams Medical Center, the Veterans Administration (VA) Boston Healthcare System, and Cape Cod Hospital (Cape Cod Healthcare). These institutions are valued partners in teaching and training medical students and residents. Three other hospitals also actively participate in the third-year surgery clerkship: MetroWest Medical Center, Berkshire Medical Center, and Kaiser Permanente Santa Clara. This annual report provides an overview of some of the clinical programs, research, and educational initiatives of the previous academic year (July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020) and highlights a few of the many accomplishments and activities of our faculty, trainees, and alumni.

Among the show's many fans was a young law student named Hilton M. Hudson, II. It quickly became clear to the future Dr. Hudson that law school was not for him. But St. Elsewhere planted the seed that medicine and cardiac surgery in particular just might be. Dr. Hudson graduated from Indiana University School of Medicine in 1987, and did his general surgery residency at Boston Medical Center (BMC) from 1987 to 1992. Looking back 30 years on, Dr. Hudson says, \"It was an insanely good teaching environment. I loved to operate, and I had a lot of opportunity to do that.\" He left BMC well prepared and in hindsight appreciates the amount of trust that was placed in him, estimating that over the course of his residency, he performed 1,500 surgeries. Following residency, Dr. Hudson completed a fellowship in cardiothoracic surgery at Ohio State University (OSU) and service in the U.S Army Medical Corps. It was during his fellowship that the subtleties of surgery started to become clearer. \"It's not just about how you hold the knife. It's about judgment and timing, and when you take a patient to surgery and when you don't, and talking to patients' families.\" Dr. Hudson credits P . David Myerowitz, MD, then Chief of Thoracic Surgery at OSU, with creating an environment that enabled him to thrive as a heart surgeon. Entrepreneurial Spirit Nowadays, a typical week consists of three days in the operating room and two spent leading his company, HPC International, Inc. (HPC). Based in Chicago, the privately held company provides a portfolio of services primarily for hospitals and the healthcare industry, including supply chain management and procurement support, library and media management services, and publishing. While Dr. Hudson has had one foot in the business world since the late '90s, he has always been a surgeon first. \"I truly love being a surgeon, and I've given my absolute best to all of my patients.\" For the last 15 years, he has been in private practice, more recently as part of a three-surgeon practice that serves hospitals in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. Earlier in his career, he was the Clinical Director and then Vice Chair of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Rockford Memorial Hospital in Rockford, Ill., where he introduced stentless valve surgery for patients there in 1998 and performed the first beating heart surgery at the hospital in 2000. Dr. Hudson also served as a Clinical Assistant Professor of Surgery at the University of Illinois College of Medicine at Rockford. He went on to become Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Franciscan Physicians Hospital in Munster, Ind., after establishing the department at the hospital, and eventually became the chairman of the hospital's board. Along the way, he became a fellow of the American College of Surgeons. One of the things that drew Dr. Hudson to BMC was the fact that there were Black surgeons on the faculty. It seems likely that he was the second African American categorical intern to complete the BMC general surgery residency program, the first being Dr. Mildred Jefferson, in 1955, a trailblazer who was the first African American woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School. While characterizing his years in training at BMC as good ones, he says that it is important to be clear. \"Racism is everywhere, and I experienced it during my residency in Boston.\" In response, he says he became fiercely focused and even more resilient. But he would never have become a surgeon at all if it weren't for another Black surgeon, whom he first met in medical school. \"I am a surgeon because of Dr. George Rawls,\" says Dr. Hudson. \"He took me under his wing and was a lifelong mentor.\" Dr. Rawls, who passed away earlier this year, broke numerous barriers during a long and distinguished career as a surgeon and an educator. Heart of the Matter Throughout his career, Dr. Hudson has been a champion of improving minority health and wellness. It was the dearth of information available to underserved communities that initially led Dr. Hilton M. Hudson, II, MD, FACS, completed his surgical residency at Boston Medical Center in 1992. Alumni \" It was an insanely good teaching environment. I loved to operate, and I had a lot of opportunity to do that.\" \u2014 Hilton Hudson, II, MDhim to start a business. After a major publishing company rejected a book he co-authored with Bert Stern, PhD, The Heart of the Matter, the African American's Guide to Heart Disease, Heart Treatment, and Heart Wellness, Drs. Hudson and Stern co-founded Hilton Publishing Company in 1996 and self-published the book. Now a division of HPC, Hilton Publishing has produced books and patient education materials on topics including sickle cell disease, hypertension, diabetes, AIDS, and lupus. \"I've always had a very entrepreneurial nature, going all the way back to grade school,\" says Dr. Hudson, who is Chairman and CEO of HPC. As HPC evolved, one of several areas where he saw a need was in addressing the impact of downsizing or eliminating medical libraries at hospitals. The company offers a popular service known as HPC Librarian, which provides a virtual library, including a librarian. Currently, HPC is working with another company to develop a new app called Pinpoint. Slated for release next year, it is designed to help adolescent sickle cell patients and their doctors target the source of pain during a pain episode and treat it quickly and appropriately. Education and Advocacy In 2014, Dr. Hudson was appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to a two-year term on the National Advisory Council on Minority Health and Health Disparities, part of the NIH's National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD). Dr. Hudson credits Nathan Stinson, Jr., MD, PhD, MPH, Director of the NIMHD Division of Scientific Programs and a longtime mentor, with being an energizing force behind the establishment of the Health Literacy Foundation and many of the other efforts he has undertaken on behalf of underserved communities. He has teamed up with celebrities, politicians, and sports figures to make headway in empowering and educating minority populations. Dr. Hudson has received numerous awards for his advocacy, including two from governors of his home state of Indiana. Everyone needs a cheerleader, and Hilton Hudson had several during his residency. \"There were a lot of good people in Boston, a lot of people who had my back. You can 'train' anyone, but it takes more to get someone past self-doubt.\" Then-Residency Director James Mezoian, MD, now retired, quickly comes to mind because of his encouragement and steadfast defense of his residents when required. Frederick Millham, MD, who was a senior resident (and later critical care fellow) was also very supportive. So too David McAneny, MD, a chief resident and then a junior faculty member during Dr. Hudson's time at BMC. Dr. Millham is now Chair of Surgery at South Shore Hospital in Weymouth, Mass., while Dr. McAneny is Vice Chair of Surgery at BMC. Young faculty members Jonathan Woodson, MD, MSS, who today leads Boston University's Institute for Health System Innovation and Policy, and Richard Shemin, MD, now the Robert and Kelly Day Professor and Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at UCLA Medical Center, also provided encouragement. Like many surgeons who have trained at BMC, Dr. Hudson has vivid memories of Friday morning \"guerrilla rounds,\" conducted in the ICU by BMC's legendary head of Trauma Surgery Erwin Hirsch, MD. \"BMC had a superb ICU, and they were instrumental in teaching me how to provide good ICU care.\" BMC may have set the stage for Dr. Hilton's successful career as a cardiothoracic surgeon, providing a foundation that has enabled him to save thousands of lives, but the institution can take no credit for the unquestioned abilities and drive he has parlayed into a thriving business. However, one thing both share is a longstanding commitment to equity in health care. Dr. Hilton's efforts to address disparities in care have undoubtedly benefitted untold numbers of people. In the end, if he were to have a second take on surgical residency, Dr. Hudson says, \"I would do it at BMC in a heartbeat.\" Dr. Hudson is in the middle row, third from right.BUSM/BMC Department of Surgery Annual Report 2020 14 13 bumc.bu.edu/surgery a sign of things to come, on March 9, Boston Mayor Marty Walsh canceled the city's St. Patrick's Day parade. When March 17 arrived, Massachusetts hospitals were under orders from Governor Charlie Baker to stop performing elective procedures. A much broader order quickly followed, directing all non- essential businesses to close their doors at noon on March 24. But by then, the novel coronavirus had already spread widely throughout the city and the state. Preparations to accommodate the anticipated influx of Covid-positive patients were orchestrated across Boston Medical Center (BMC), which transformed spaces to create additional ICU and medical care capacity. The rate of admissions for Covid-19 swelled throughout March, until hitting full stride around the third week of April\u2014the surge. On one Sunday night that month, BMC's ICUs were so overwhelmed, ambulances were instructed to bring patients presumed to be suffering from Covid symptoms to other hospitals. BMC, a safety-net hospital that provides care for underserved communities saw its surge in patients earlier than other local hospitals. Data clearly show that Covid-19 disproportionately affects minority communities, and during the peak at BMC, approximately 80 percent of coronavirus patients were Black or Hispanic. By comparison, 60 percent of all patients admitted during the previous year were Black or Hispanic. Unprecedented Need With the number of patients extremely ill with Covid rising, Department of Surgery Critical Care faculty were sequestered to provide 24/7 coverage for the primary surgical intensive care unit (SICU) service, as well as coverage for two additional intensive care teams. Major changes were instituted on the service, with the Departments of Surgery and Anesthesiology coming together to meet the truly urgent and unprecedented need. Reflecting on what had become the new normal, attending surgical intensivist Tejal Brahmbhatt, MD, said, \"Our team never stopped. They worked tirelessly and with conviction day in and day out to support our patients.\" For 9 weeks, surgery residents rearranged their schedules (while staying within duty-hour limits), to provide tremendous support in the SICU alongside the Department of Surgery's dedicated and skilled advanced practice providers and critical care nursing staff. And closing in on the end of a fellowship year they never could have anticipated, the department's surgical critical care fellows stepped up to take on leadership roles. \"Unfortunately in life, there are pandemics and mass casualty Covid WarriorsHighlight: Patient Care InSICU team huddle on Saturday, April 25, 10:30 pm. Led by surgical intensivist Tejal Brahmbhatt, MD, a team of Surgery and Anesthesiology residents and critical care nurses reviewed the status of Covid-19 patients. events,\" said Tracey Dechert, MD, Chief of Surgical Critical Care and Director of the SICU. \"Whether our community is suffering because of a virus or a bomb, there is no team I would rather be working with than our SICU team. Teamwork helped our patients get better while also helping us to support each other.\" Extending a Hand The Department of Surgery responded to the crisis with resolve and ingenuity to ensure that Covid-19 patients, as well as those whose surgeries could not be postponed, received the care they needed. By the end of March, with the census of Covid-positive patients growing ever larger and elective surgeries canceled, it became clear that the department could play a role in relieving some of the burden for their BMC colleagues. A Covid-19 Procedure Team, led by F. Thurston Drake, MD, MPH, was quickly formed. \"In times of crisis such as this, we think of BMC\u2014and especially our commitment to its mission\u2014as something like a home,\" said Dr. Drake. \"So for us, being asked to contribute in this way was akin to being asked for help by a family member, in this case, our colleagues caring for these very sick patients.\" All for One The larger procedure team was structured into teams of two senior residents and an attending surgeon. Between April 1 and June 1, the Covid-19 procedure team performed 380 procedures, placing arterial, central venous, and hemodialysis catheters, as well as a small number of chest tubes. A paper published in Surgery quantified the team's results for the month of April, when 272 procedures were performed on 125 patients. The average time (including donning and doffing PPE) for placing a central venous catheter was 47 minutes, and the rate of immediate complications was 1.5 percent, substantially less than rates reported in the literature. \"The procedure team was a godsend for the Covid teams,\" said Jaime Murphy, MD, Medical Director for Respiratory Therapy. \"It freed up medical providers to focus on caring for patients day and night, while providing the best possible procedural support to our patients, and also allowed the MICU team to create an additional Covid team.\" \"As they always do, our surgery residents stepped up and answered the call,\" reflected Dr. Drake. \"Their hard work and esprit de corps were really something inspiring.\" Then-chief resident Josh Davies, MD (right) and senior surgery resident Sherif Aly, MD, perform a lifesaving invasive procedure under the supervision of attending surgeon Pei-Wen Lim, MD, MS.

The Laszlo N. Tauber Professorship in Surgery was created to make it a little easier. Unlike most endowed professorships, this three-year appointment is available for early-career faculty members. Daniel Roh, MD, PhD, is the newest Laszlo N. Tauber Assistant Professor in Surgery. \"The Tauber professorship is an honor for me,\" says Dr. Roh. \"As I'm building my research career, it will provide much-needed financial support to start my lab and build the infrastructure necessary to perform basic and translational research.\" Dr. Roh joined the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) faculty and the Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Boston Medical Center (BMC) in November 2019. He received his MD and PhD from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (UPSOM) Medical Scientist Training Program and completed the Harvard Combined Plastic Surgery Residency Training Program before coming to BUSM/BMC. \"I am captivated by the field of senescence, the stress-response mechanism by which cells in our body undergo permanent growth arrest without dying, and its contribution to aging and disease,\" says, Dr. Roh, whose research focuses on examining the role of senescence in wound healing and scarring. Two projects being planned for the new Roh lab will test hypotheses related to senescence modification. The first will examine whether senescent cell burden in aged skin impacts wound healing, while the second will test whether senescent cells contribute to wound-induced skin fibrosis and the formation of hypertrophic scars and keloids. Dr. Roh hopes to translate his work into novel therapies targeting impaired wound healing of aging, chronic wounds, and pathologic scarring. Dr. Tauber's Legacy The Tauber Professorship is made possible through the Laszlo N. Tauber Family Foundation, which was established in 2003 by Ingrid Tauber, PhD, and Alfred I. Tauber, MD, Zoltan Kohn Professor of Medicine emeritus at BUSM, in memory of their father. Born in Hungary in 1915, Laszlo Tauber, MD, was a distinguished surgeon, a celebrated athlete, and a highly successful real estate entrepreneur, who was committed to philanthropy throughout his life. His generous donations to BUSM include medical student scholarships and an endowed chair in the Department of Medicine. Today, the Tauber Family Foundation's grantmaking is focused on the areas of mental health, scientific research, the Jewish community, and social justice. \"BU is my sister's alma mater, and I was on the faculty for 29 years, so our affiliation with the university is long and deep,\" said Dr. Alfred Tauber. \"The Tauber Professorship reflects our commitment to the continued growth of the medical school. In that spirit, we congratulate Dr. Roh on his appointment.\" Changing Course With his father, sister, and brother all physicians, medicine may have been Daniel Roh's destiny, but specializing in plastic surgery was not part of the original plan. While working on his PhD, he joined a corneal cell biology lab and received a prestigious Kirschstein Award from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) to study cellular mechanisms associated with age- related degeneration of the cornea. He was on a path to becoming an ophthalmologist and researcher. \"I was fortunate to have an amazing mentor at UPSOM, the late Dr. James Funderburgh, who discovered a new population of corneal stem cells and demonstrated that they could reverse corneal scarring. In ophthalmology, I found the surgeries to be incredibly high-impact with respect to improving patient lives.\" But in a story that is certain to have a familiar ring for many, Dr. Roh says, \"After my medical school rotations in plastic surgery, Highlight: Research G Tauber Professorship Daniel Roh, MD, PhD (left) and F . Thurston Drake, MD, MPHI knew that plastics was the field I was meant to be in.\" While still at UPSOM, his interest in wound healing and aging research blossomed, growing exponentially during residency, when he had the opportunity to work with Indranil Sinha, MD, and Dennis Orgill, MD, PhD, both plastic surgeons and scientists affiliated with Brigham and Women's Hospital. As the U.S. population skews older, the relevance of Dr. Roh's research is clear, and he recently received two NIH awards to support his work on senescence; he is the principal investigator (PI) of a Boston Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center Research Education Core Award and the PI of an NIA RO3 GEMSSTAR Award. Defying Nature In addition to financial support, Dr. Roh says that a supportive environment and committed mentors were major factors in his decision to join BUSM/BMC. There were also numerous senior researchers he hoped to work with, and now has the opportunity to do just that. He will begin a collaboration with Vladimir Botchkarev, MD, PhD, BUSM Research Associate Professor of Dermatology and world renowned for his expertise in the epigenetics of skin development, differentiation, and tumorigenesis. But it's Dr. Botchkarev's expertise in aging and wound healing that will form the basis for their collaboration to study scar-free wound healing in aging- resistant naked mole rats. In addition to being cancer-resistant, this species of rat's unique characteristics include a lifespan of up to 30 years, senescence resistance, and defiance of the biological laws of aging. The hope is that they will be a unique model for studying mechanisms preventing scar formation in humans. Prior to Dr. Roh, the Tauber Professorship was held by F. Thurston Drake, MD, MPH, an attending surgeon in the BMC sections of Surgical Endocrinology and Surgical Oncology. Dr. Drake, who joined the BUSM faculty in 2016, says, \"It's very rare for a foundation to focus on a junior faculty member, but I believe it's truly visionary and can lead to early innovations that might otherwise be missed.\" During his tenure as Tauber Professor, he took full advantage of the support he received, initiating two major research programs. The first focused on examining whether limited English proficiency impacts surgical outcomes, while the second centered on system-wide approaches for improving management of incidental radiographic findings. Maximum Impact After adjusting for confounding factors, the first study found no meaningful differences in short-term outcomes in patients whose primary language was not English. In conducting the second, Dr. Drake maximized Tauber Foundation support, which covered the majority of costs, by combining it with a BMC Patient Safety Grant. He developed a two-year pilot program to identify and track patients with incidental adrenal masses and report findings to patients' primary care physicians, along with simple instructions on how to perform the appropriate evaluation. Final results from the project are pending, but an analysis of one particular component showed a doubling in the rate of incidental masses that were appropriately evaluated. \"Based on the success of this pilot project, we are currently working with the hospital to develop this protocol into a permanent aspect of our management strategy and expand it to other organ systems,\" says Dr. Drake, whose primary research interests also include appendicitis. Both initiatives engaged trainees in research and served as a jumping-off point for additional research. \"Mentoring further extends the legacy of the Tauber Family Foundation's generosity,\" says Dr. Drake. \"Several surgical residents and medical students have had the opportunity to spearhead research projects under my mentorship, which was enabled by support from the foundation.\" Inspiration for the Future When thinking about the challenges that lie ahead in becoming a successful surgeon-scientist, Dr. Roh continues to draw inspiration from the time he spent with his UPSOM mentor Jim Funderburgh. \"He did science with such joy and passion. He truly enjoyed the process of scientific discovery and felt immense satisfaction with every incremental result. I have always wanted to emulate his approach. I now have the opportunity to make scientific discoveries on my own, and the Tauber Professorship will be so beneficial in truly launching my research career.\"Laszlo Tauber, MD \"\u0007 I\u0007now\u0007have\u0007the\u0007opportunity\u0007to\u0007make\u0007scientific\u0007discoveries \u0007 on my own, and the Tauber Professorship will be so beneficial\u0007in\u0007truly\u0007launching\u0007my\u0007research\u0007career.\" \u2014 Daniel Roh, MD, PhDBUSM/BMC Department of Surgery Annual Report 2020 18 17 bumc.bu.edu/surgery or nearly a decade, Boston Medical Center (BMC) has been making strides in reducing its carbon footprint and can now lay claim to the title of greenest hospital in Boston. Changes have ranged from small\u2014energy-saving LED bulbs in the operating rooms (ORs) and across the hospital\u2014to large, building a cogeneration plant. Since launching a renovation and sustainability initiative in 2011, BMC has invested heavily in its infrastructure to improve energy efficiency and sustainability, with impressive results. The most substantial undertaking, and one that will pay dividends well into the future, was installing a natural gas-fired cogeneration plant on the roof of the Yawkey Ambulatory Center. Operational since 2017, this \"cogen\" facility traps most of the waste heat produced and uses it to warm the BMC campus, saving both emissions and money. Hybrid OR on Display As the hospital's master plan evolved, it was clear that the operating rooms, by definition a significant source of energy consumption and waste production, needed to be part of it. New or renovated ORs that opened in 2017 are \"green\" and have garnered interest from various sources. On the morning of December 4, a reporter and photographer from local radio station WBUR, an NPR affiliate, came by to see one in action. Members of the anesthesiology and vascular surgery teams provided details during a two-hour TCAR (transcarotid artery revascularization) procedure in the hybrid OR. They watched as the team cleared a blockage in the left carotid artery of 83-year-old Reverend Ralph Kee. Regardless of which type of anesthesia is used, studies show that patients metabolize only about 5 percent, with the rest eventually released into the atmosphere. At BMC, using sevoflurane over desflurane is a boon for the environment, desflurane being a significantly more potent greenhouse gas. In addition, the CO2 exhaled by the patient is filtered through a canister system installed in 2018, which absorbs much of the carbon in pellets that can then be safely discarded. Like all ORs, the temperature in this one is lower than in other areas of the hospital. In winter, the outside air plays a role in cooling this space by chilling water that Highlight: Environmental Health F BMC vascular surgeons perform a TCAR procedure. Greening the OR Reverend Ralph Kee is rolled into the eco-friendly hybrid OR.can be used for this purpose after passing through something known as a free cooling system. Thanks to the cogen plant, less energy needs to be drawn from the electric grid to warm or cool the building that houses the OR, and to drive the ventilation system that works overtime to control staff exposure to anesthetic gases and ensure infection control. In addition, every OR now has a green receptacle for items that can be recycled. Energy Efficiency \"The cogen unit supplies approximately 40 percent of the hospital's energy needs and operates at 70 percent efficiency, compared with 35 percent for a traditional power plant,\" says Bob Biggio, BMC's Senior Vice President for Facilities and Support Services. Inside the Yawkey building, a retrofit of the ductwork reduced the amount of energy required to push air through the system. Together, these changes are saving BMC close to $1.5 million in heating and energy costs annually. \"BMC is about 96 percent carbon neutral for energy and is on track to reach 100 percent by the end of 2020,\" says Biggio. \"The hospital still utilizes fossil fuel, but this use is offset by renewable energy credits garnered as a result of buying solar power from North Carolina.\" Broad Commitment BMC's commitment to the environment is not limited to its own campus and encompasses environmental health in a broad sense. As part of the Boston Green Ribbon Commission's Health Care Working Group, and through other forums, the hospital works collaboratively with local hospitals to reduce the healthcare industry's not inconsiderable environmental impact on the city, which has set a goal of being carbon neutral by 2050. Since 2011, the leaders of Boston's hospitals believe they have collectively reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent. Environmental Stewardship In addition, BMC has found a way to put 7,000 square feet of what would otherwise be wasted space to good use. For the past three years, the roof of its power plant has been a farm (and beehive) that produces food for the hospital's therapeutic food pantry and inpatient meal service. Kitchen scraps find their way to an industrial food digester, which cuts down on the amount of waste that ends up in a landfill, reducing potential groundwater and soil contamination as well as emissions from the trucks needed to haul it away. A 2019 article in The New England Journal of Medicine concluded, \"Health professionals have leading roles to play in addressing climate change.\" Acknowledging that more remains to be done, BMC's investment of nearly $400 million (raised through grants, the first \"Green Bond\" offering by a hospital in the U.S., and the sale of excess real estate) over the last several years to improve energy efficiency and reduce its carbon footprint is evidence that decreasing the institution's environmental impact is a high priority.

Boston Medical Center (BMC), like other institutions, was left scrambling to meet the demand. In addition to donations of much-needed PPE, the philanthropic support from friends of BMC and of the Department of Surgery, as well as complete strangers, has been absolutely remarkable. In our own department, we were happy to receive 200 slightly expired N95 masks (newly deemed safe by the CDC), which one of our team coordinators had rescued from disposal with an eye toward home project use. In-kind donations included scores of meals for our surgery residents and other frontline workers. We also received wonderful messages of encouragement via email from patients past and present. Tremendous Generosity Hau Le, MD, a pediatric surgeon at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health and a graduate of Boston University School of Medicine, reached out to Chief of Surgery Jennifer Tseng, MD, MPH, and then very kindly donated 1,000 masks for personal protective use by surgical trainees and advanced practice providers. And a special thank you goes out to an anonymous donor and friend of the department, introduced through the Morningside Foundation, who exhibited tremendous generosity by donating 10,000 surgical masks to BMC. Before the pandemic, the department was the beneficiary of another much-appreciated donation from the Morningside Foundation. Their support is enabling research fellow Alaina Geary, MD, to stay the course for an additional year and keep the momentum going on her research. We are also very fortunate to have Marshall and Missy Carter in our corner. Longtime donors to BMC, it is because of their generosity that we were able to announce and welcome Kelly Kenzik, PhD, MS, as the inaugural Carter Visiting Scholar in Cancer Disparities. Ongoing Support We are grateful to the Morningside Foundation and the Carters for providing support that promotes and amplifies departmental research focused on improving care and reducing disparities. This commitment to BMC and its mission, and to underwriting research, is shared by longtime donors Marc and Claire Perlman. Together with colleagues from Ocean State Job Lot, they launched a point-of-sale program that raised $450,000. In addition, the Perlmans donated PPE and truckloads of clothing for homeless patients with Covid-19 who were recuperating at a nearby hospital-run facility. Further, their generosity extends to continued sponsorship of surgeon Teviah Sachs, MD, MPH, as the Perlman Scholar for Pancreatic Cancer Research. We are so grateful to the Perlmans, the Carters, the Morningside Foundation, and to everyone who has stood with BMC during this unprecedented time and in the past. Our patients were the beneficiaries of your donations, large and small, to the BMC Covid-19 Relief Fund. Thank you!The Kindness of Friends and Strangers A (Left to right) Surgery residents Drs. Aldana Blanco, Maha Haqqani, Jian Zheng, and Breyen Coffin with PPE that was generously donated. Of Note In Solidarity On Friday, June 5, Department of Surgery faculty, staff, and residents joined their Boston Medical Center colleagues in the nationwide White Coats for Black Lives protest to honor the memory of George Floyd and other Black men and women who have died as a result of excessive force and violence by police. They knelt for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in a symbolic show of solidarity to acknowledge ongoing racial injustice, including in medicine, and the role that the healthcare system and its leaders have in helping to dismantle the structural racism that pervades society. With a gray yet beautiful sky and the Boston skyline as a backdrop, a sense of sadness, collective unity, and commitment to racial justice and improving the state of our nation and the health care of its denizens was tangible. WSJ Article Recounts Covid Experience Boston Medical Center's story was told through the experience of trauma surgeon Tracey Dechert, MD, Chief of Surgical Critical Care, and Adriana, a young mother and courageous patient who delivered a healthy baby boy while in the surgical intensive care unit. A Wall Street Journal (WSJ) article described the teamwork among critical care physicians, nursing, OB-GYN, and the entire staff as they dealt with the medical challenges and emotions of a historic pandemic. \"She is going to make it,\" Dr. Dechert would tell herself, as she passed Adriana's room during her daily rounds. This story has a happy ending because that hopeful prediction came true. High Marks for Quality of Surgical Care Boston Medical Center tracked patient outcomes for inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures throughout 2018 as part of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP\u00ae). Based on these data, the hospital was one of only 56 institutions (out of 722) that were recognized for delivering high-quality care in two categories: \"All Cases\" and \"High-Risk\" cases. Built by surgeons for surgeons, the NSQIP program is designed to measure and improve the quality of surgical care while reducing complications and costs.

Our five-year program, which is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME), is committed to preparing future generations of highly skilled surgeons. The Surgery Residency Program is based at Boston University Medical Center, a modern medical complex located in the heart of Boston's South End. The medical center includes Boston University School of Medicine, the Boston University School of Public Health, the Boston University Goldman School of Dental Medicine, the National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories, as well as Boston Medical Center. The principal goal of our program is clinical excellence. We provide exposure to a large, diverse patient population and broad experience in complex open and minimally invasive surgery, which are the essential elements in the training of outstanding surgeons. With very few fellowship programs, the focus of our program is the education of the general surgery resident. Residents interested in careers in academic surgery develop the necessary skills in surgical research through a broad range of training opportunities designed to maximize academic development. Residents who choose to spend dedicated academic time on research complete course work in statistics and other methodologies to become independent researchers. 2020 Surgery Residency Graduates Maunil Bhatt, MD Vascular Surgery Fellowship University of California, San Francisco Joshua Davies, MD Academic Practice Boston Medical Center Matthew Egyud, MD Thoracic Surgery Fellowship Baylor College of MedicineKrista Hachey, MD Thoracic Surgery Fellowship University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital Jian Zheng, MD Surgical Oncology Fellowship University of Pittsburgh Medical Center2020 Surgery Residency graduates (from left): Drs.
