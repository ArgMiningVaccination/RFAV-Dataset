The Golden Light practitioner course is not typical energy work training. Through her own powerful experiences, Srivastava has created this powerful healing modality that allows others to access their own power and create their own beautiful, healing journey at a soul level. Sessions will be held monthly for two hours, and after six months, two full-day workshops will take place in person. There will be healings, clearings, teachings, blockage removals and meditations. In the year one Golden Light Practitioner course, participants will connect to themselves and their souls on a deeper level than ever before, form an unshakable spiritual foundation for their entire life, accelerate their own spiritual evolution and healing journey at an exponential rate and begin to understand and work with the Golden Light energy to heal themselves and the world. Srivastava invites yoga and reiki practitioners/teachers, wellness specialists, Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) and other therapeutic providers, life and wellness coaches, mentors and \"anyone who wants to help people, create peace in the world and believes in love\" to participate in the program. Location: Bhavna's Wellness Group, 512 Main St., Ste. #5, Shrewsbury. For more information, call 774-242-2112 or visit BHWellness Group.com.
