Why did I receive an email from Smartsheet about data errors? Smartsheets automatically review data entries for any errors, such as negative entries or vaccine given that exceed the total number of staff or residents in the LTC. Data entry errors are flagged based on one or more of the following conditions: - Negative number entries, - The number of staff and/or residents fully vaccinated exceeds the total number of staff or residents, - The number of staff and/or residents that received a booster exceeds the total number of staff or residents, or - The number of staff and/or residents that received a booster exceeds the fully vaccinated number of staff or residents. How do I update these data errors? Smartsheet will send the point of contact listed in the initial form an email with either staff or resident data errors listed. Click \"Open the Smartsheet\" to be redirected to a Smartsheet form to correct the data errors. Data entry errors MUST be corrected within 72 hours of the initial data entry. For additional support, please reach out to Brianna at [Brianna.klein@iem.com](mailto:brianna.klein@iem.com) Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. CST. How do I know my errors were corrected? After the data errors are corrected, you will no longer receive an email from Smartsheet with the title \"CORRECTION NEEDED: "}
