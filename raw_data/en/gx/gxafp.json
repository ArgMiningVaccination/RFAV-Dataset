Foreword from the Chair and Chief Executive Welcome to our annual report and accounts for 2017/18. Our vision is: Excellence in Neuroscience. About this annual report Foreword from the Chair and Chief Executive Welcome to The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust's Annual Report for the period 1st April 2017 to 31st March 2018. About The Walton Centre The Walton Centre was established in 1992 and attained Foundation Trust status o n 1st August 2009. It is the only standalone neurosciences Trust in the UK and serves a patient population of circa 3.5 million from Merseyside, Cheshire, Lancashire, Greater Manchester, the Is le of Man and North Wales. The Walton Centre was inspected by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in April 2016. The Trust was given an Outstanding rating in October 2016, making it the first specialist NHS trust in the country to be given the rating withou t having any areas deemed as 'needing improvement '. The report highlighted many examples where staff had 'gone the extra mile' to support patients' individual needs, that there was a positive culture throughout the Trust, and that staff were highly -skilled and committed. Recognising that the NHS is facing a period of profound change, The Walton Centre 's strategy continues to put patients at the heart of delivering care and focuses on six key areas: sustaining and developing our services; developing our h ospital; improving quality; research and innovation for patient care; our workforce ; and our financial health. New Chair Janet Rosser In April 2017 Janet Rosser took up the position as the Trust's new Chair following the departure of Ken Hoskisson MBE. Janet has been a member of the Trust's Board for a number of years, and brings a deep understanding of the Trust and the local health economy to the role. 7 New Chief Executive Hayley Citrine In December 2017 the Trust appointed Director of Nursing and Ope rations Hayley Citrine as the new Chief Executive following the departure of former Chief Executive Chris Harrop and a rigorous recruitment process. Hayley took up the position in February 2018. The Chief Executive has been working alongside staff from acr oss the hospital to refresh and refocus the overall vision and strategy for the Trust during 2018 , and to enhance links with other organisations in the local and national health and social care economy. Intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (iMRI) The Trust has now completed a \u00a38.1m project to create two new theatres and an intra -operative Magnetic Resonance Imaging scanner to benefit patients and give the organisation more capacity to meet growing demand. The iMRI scanner was provided via a \u00a32m donati on by the Marina Dalglish Appeal. The new facilities were first used in April 2017 and they were officially opened by the Marina Dalglish Appeal in November 2017. Investors in People Gold Standard The Trust was reaccredited with the Investors in People Gold Standard in June 2017, a reflection of the open and supportive culture that staff have built together. Investors in People is the international standard for people management, testing organisatio ns against a rigorous framework for best practice in the workplace. The Walton Centre Charity During the year, the Charity continued to go from strength to strength. Community support grew steadily and in addition to raising awareness, the Charity also r aised funds for specific purposes such as the Home from Home Fund to support the annual costs of the relatives' accommodation; and the Sid Watkins Innovation Fund which enabled the Trust to purchase a Robotic Arm - a state -of-the-art piece of equipment to support a number of neurosurgical procedures. Vanguard Programme The Walton Centre was chosen to lead an Acute Care Collaborative Vanguard in 2015 - The Neuro Network - under NHS England's New Care Models of Care Programme. Vanguards have been finding new ways of working that can close the widening gaps in the health of the population, improve the quality of care, and improve the funding of services. This is part of the vision of The NHS Five Year Forward View to create a sustainable NHS. Over the last thr ee years the Trust has worked closely with other key partner organisations within Cheshire & Merseyside to improve care for patients with back pain as well as those with neurological conditions , including specifically: 8 - Achieve a clinically and financiall y sustainable integrated neurology service by enhancing the community support, clinical pathways and advice and support for primary and secondary care; - To support a whole system spinal services network, embedding the National Back Pain Pathway - new evidence based guidance for back pain treatment and referral. The work of The Neuro Network has already led to significant improvements in patient care. The Integrated Neurology Nurse Specialists for example have seen more than 1,500 patients with neurological conditions at home or in a community setting, and the Nurse Advice Line has provided advice and guidance to over 3,000 patients since expanding its service. PLACE R eport The Walton Centre excelled again in the national Patient -led Assessment of Care Envi ronment (PLACE) inspection. The Trust's average across all seven areas of the assessment including cleanliness, disability access, and food was 99.9%; which was the second highest scoring in the region. Improving Quality Significant work has been undertaken to improve the quality of care to both patients and their families. In line with the Trust's s trategy , we have continued to engage with staff, patients and families through varied opportunities including Berwick Sessions, Schwart z Rounds, Staff Listening Events and patient and family engagement. The Trust has continued to reduce hospital acquired pressure ulcers and hospital acquired infections. This year the Trust was presented with positive feedback from NHS Improvement as an organisation that had reduced e -coli infections by 17.6%, over and above the 10% reduction trajectory. Catheter A ssociated Urinary Tract I nfections (CAUTI) : The Trust has made substantial progress in reducing CAUTIs . Durin g 2017 -2018 there were 23 patients with CAUTIs against an internal reduction target of 31 and we aim to reduce cases further during 2018 -2019 with our comprehensive education programme. Methic illin-resistant Staphylococcus A ureus (MRSA ) There is zero tolerance at both national l evel and internally within the Trust. Therefore, it was disappointing to have a patient who developed an MRSA bloodstream infection. A comprehensive investigation was undertaken and an action pl an implemented. Our aim is to embed learning across the T rust t o improve patient safety and we will continue this work throughout 2018 -2019 . Methicillin -sensitive Staphylococcus Aureus (MSSA ) There were 11 patients with MSSA against an interna l target of 9. All cases we re investigated an d learning opportunities sha red across the T rust. We aim to reduce MSSA during 2018 -2019 and have set an internal target of no more than 9 cases. 9 The Trust achieved all Quality Account priorities , which highlight ed the continued motivation and enthusiasm of staff to achieve a reduction in harm thus enabling enhanced patient safety. Health and Wellbeing As a Health and Wellbeing exemplar trust, The Walton Centre has continued to offer a range of benefits and support to staff to promote physical and mental wellbei ng, and was awarded the Health@Work Workplace Wellbeing Charter following an independent assessment. Director of Workforce Mike Gibney and Jane Mullin, Deputy Director of HR, have spoken at national conferences and events to share insights and advice about Health and Wellbeing provision with other NHS trusts and organisations. The Trust was also reaccredited with the Investors In People Gold Standard, reflecting the strong supportive culture staff have created. This year staff have had the opportunity to take part in Schwartz Rounds, discussion forums for staff to share experiences and reflections of working in a healthcare setting; Berwick Sessions, engagement events for all staff groups built around a new theme each time; a range of exercise classes and health and wellbeing events; and had the opportunity to download a free app with daily healthy living tips. Acknowledgements The Trust Board would like to pay tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff and the invaluable assistance provided by many supporters, including volunteers, support groups, charitable groups, fundraisers, mem bers, governors, current and previous patients. Special thanks also go to Chris Harrop, the Trust's former Chief Executive who stepped down at the end of January 2018 , for his many years of service to the organisation during a period of great change and success. The Board of Directors would also like to thank all those who have raised funds and donated money to The Walton Centre Charity and the Home from Home Appeal. The Trust is very grateful for the continued support and hard work. The Board of Directors is responsible for ensuring the production of the Trust's annual report and accounts and considers this document, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for patients, regulators and other stakeholders to assess The Walton Centre 's performance, business model and strategy. Hayley Citrine , Chief Executive Janet Rosser, Chair 25 May 2018 25 May 2018 10 This report was approved and adopted by the Board of Directors on 25 May 2018 . The Trust's 2017/18 accounts have been prepared under a direction issued by Monitor under the National Health Service Act 2006. 2i. Performance Report - overview of performance Principal Purpose The principal purpose of the Trust is the provision of goo ds and services for the health service in England. The Walton Way Guiding the work of the Trust are the Walton Way values and behaviours, developed with staff, which have become well embedded over recent years - caring, pride, openness, dignity and respe ct. Strategic Objectives The Trust had six overarching strategic aims to support the delivery of its five year strategic plan 2014 -19: 1. Improving quality by focusing on patient safety, patient experience and clinical effectiveness 2. Sustaining and developing our services 3. Research and innovation for patient care 4. Developing our hospital 5. Recruiting, retaining and developing our workforce 6. Maintaining our financial health. The Trust's strategy for the next five years is currently under development. The develop ment of services and the hospital to ensure the growing number of patients requiring specialist neuroscience services ge t the care they need, when and where they need it remains f undamental to the Trust . Increasingly, we are working as the hub for a network of services provided in hospitals and community locations across Merseyside, Cheshire, North Wales and the wider North West - the Cheshire and Merseyside Major Trauma Centre Collaborative, Cheshire and Merseyside Rehabilitation Network, our 11 neurology services provided in 34 locations, and the developing spinal surgery network. This also includes supporting GPs and hospitals to manage patients with neurological conditions better locally, without referring to the specialist centre. Our work in leading whole system services in neurology and spinal services was recognised and supported through NHS England's Acute Care Collaborative Vanguard programme for the two years to March 2018. This is continuing, and we are also supporting others to replicate our models elsewhere across the country. As the hub, the Trust needs to ensure it remains at the leading edge of neuroscience care. Support for research is therefore essential for underpinning high quality car e into the future. The Trust had invested for the future by creating the first adult intraoperative MRI scanner suite in the North, to improve outcomes for patients with brain tumours and enable the introduction o f innovative treatments. This wa s part of a n \u00a38.1m capital investment to develop two additional operating theatres to treat the growing number of patients. The theatres/IMRI development came int o operational use in April 2017 and the numbers of patients benefiting from the new technology has been b uilt up through the last year. We are now turning our minds to planning our next major innovative investment to improve patient care. Hand -in-hand with this investment is a focus on working smarter - streamlining patient pathways and processes to improve safety, enhance patients' experience of care and enable the Trust to see more patients in line with its growing demand . This includes enhancing the opportunities of information management and technology, including progressing towards a full electronic pati ent record. Running throughout is the commitment to improving t he quality of the care provided by the Trust, wherever this is. Business, Activity and Performance Throughout 2017/18 , the Trust has remained in a strong position on quality and performance. Through the Trust's two divisions - Neurosurgery and Neurology, it continues to deliver excellent care to patients. The Division of Neurosurgery is responsible for: Neurosurgery Anaesthetics Theatres Surgical wards Critical Care Pain Medicine Pain Management Programme Neuroscience Laboratories Day Case Unit Advanced Neurosurgery Nurses 12 Advanced Pain Medicine Nurses Cancer Services Major Trauma Service Clinical Audit and Outcomes Teaching and Training across the specialities within the division The Division of Neurology is responsible for: Neurology ; hub and spoke outpatient service, day cases and inpatient ward Therapies Integrated Neurology Nurses Disease specific Specialist Nurses Neurophysiology Neuropsychiatry Neuropsychology Pharmacy Service L evel Agreement Patient Access Centre Medical Secretariat Complex r ehabilitation Neuror adiology Clinical Audit Division of Neurosurgery Over the last year there has been significant development in the infrastructure, resource and innovation portfolio of the Division. The iMRI, O -ARM and Robotic Arm have been operationalised in year placing us at the forefront of operative capability in the UK, enhancing our Oncological, Spinal and Fu nctional Service provision. Further expansion of our theatre complex and bed base has also provide d the physical capacity to meet current demand and provides the ability to increase our workload in the future to meet projected future demand . The division also continues to expand our multi -professional specialist team. Within the Neurosurgery Service t here are 20 Consultant Neurosurgeons, 2 Consultant Orthopaedic surgeons and 25 Specialist Nurses working alongside Allied Health Professionals (AHP s) to delive r specialist services at the centre and at eight satellites sites at partner Trusts across Cheshire and Merseyside, Isle of Man and Wales . Within the Pain Medicine Service there are 7 Consultants in Pain Medicine and 4 Specialist Nurses again supported by AHP's to deliver a highly specialised pain service on site enhanced by joint s pecialist clinics working with Liverpool Womens and Alder Hey. 13 Neurosurgery The department continues to be one of the busiest neurosurgical units in the cou ntry, seeing 10,000 new patient s, 4,000 elective , and 1 ,800 emergency inpatients during 2017/18. Achievement of the Referral to Treat (RTT) target has been successfully maintained across all specialities in year however this remains one of the biggest challenges faced by the division which has become more challenging due to the increased patient activity seen whilst supporting a local hospital who have temporar ily suspen ded their spinal service. To date , just over 1 ,200 of these patients have transferre d to our service and have been assessed, treated or discharged. We continue to receive patients for follow up on a monthly basis from the provider. While RTT was met inclusive of the transferre d patients, the Trust reported 7 patients who exceeded the 52 week maximum wait as a result of the transfer. These patients had been waiting over 10 months at their previous Trust when The Walton Centre received the referral . While we endeavour ed to see all patients as timely as possible, due to the wait at the pr evious Trust, patient choice and the requirement for further investigations , the 52 week threshold was exceeded in this small number of patients. The number of emergency referrals also continues to increase year on year. In 2017/18 almost 9,000 referrals w ere received by the on -call team compared to 7 ,720 in 2016/17. The addition of two emergency admission co -ordinators in year has provided the clinical teams with valuable support and also improved the speed at which calls are dealt with and response times to referring clinicians. Since September 2017, we have been runnin g a Complex Spinal on -call rota alongside our Neurosurgical on-call rota. Complex spinal expertise has always been accessible out of hours however this development is the formalisation of this access and reflects the increasing volume and complexity of eme rgency patient referrals as well as being a recommendation suggested by the national GIRFT team during their visit to review our Spinal service in summer 2017. The Neurosurgical Divis ion maintains a high presence at the Society of British Neurological Surg eons (SBNS) and hosted the Society meeting in Liverpool in 2017 , jointly with the African Neurosurgical Societies in September 2017. Mr May , Consultant Neurosurgeon remains President of the SBNS until September and Miss Gilkes , Consultant Neurosurgeon has been appointed Meetings Secretary and sits on the Executive Council of the SBNS. Other designations held nationally and inte rnally include Mr Pigott as Pre sident Elect of Euro spine and Professor Eldridge is the Northern Representative on the Neuroscience Clinical Reference Group for Neurosurgery . Internally, Mr Wilby was appointed as the Trust Clinical Research Director . The demand for our deformity service continues and we were delighted to expand our Orthopaedic workforce with the recruitment of a furthe r Consultant Orthopaedic surgeon in March 2018. 14 At the beginning of the year our new theatre suite and \u00a32m Intra operative (iMRI) scanner , funded by the Marina Dalglish Appeal , was used to treat patients with brain tumours and other complex conditions for the first time. The development was an extension to the existing Theatre complex allowing business to continue as usual with no disruption to admissions, surgery or clinics. Since then the iMRI scanner has been used regularly to scan patients during surgery, enabling our surgeons to be as thorough as possible when removing tumours. Having the state -of-the-art scanner in the theatres department reduces the chances of patients n eeding more surgery in the future. There are now six neurosurgeons using the iMRI as part of their standard operative practice. This new theatres configuration with iMRI is the first of its kind for adults in the North of England. As part of this developm ent, two new theatres were built around the iMRI scanner, thus increasing the existing numbe r of theatres from six to eight. T his increas ed capacity has enabled the Trust to treat more patients. While the demand on services currently only requires the commissioning of one o f the new theatres, we were able to support a neighbouring Trust for a period while their theatre complex was under going refurbishment by allowing them to use our unused theatre thus enabling cont inuity of service provision for the local population. Further technological advances were also introduced to support surgical procedures including: - A new robotic arm for use particularly in the field of Epilepsy. Comparable to a \"GPS\" for the brain, the ro bot can be used for any type of cranial procedure which requires surgical planning with pre - operative data, patient registration and precise positioning and handling of instruments. The Robotic Arm became operational in March 2018 - The O -ARM intraoperative spinal navigation system used for spinal fixation cases increasing the safety of complicated surgery. The technology improves accuracy of instrumentation placement, exposes patients to less radiation than other techniques and allows for immediate revision of instrumentation avoiding repeat revision surgeries. The O -ARM has been in use since May 2017. Same Day Admission (SDA) for all eligible elective patients was launched in May 2017. The project saw an increase of our patients with admission on t he day of surgery rate from 7% to a rate of 60 %. Several key improvements were made to our processes and systems involved in preparing patients for admission including revised patient information, anaesthetic and consent protocols, increased pre -operative assessment capacity, and creation of a Surgical Admissions Lounge. This was alongside the project led by our IT department to digitalise patient records (ep2) which supports Same Day Admission by highlighting patients' pre -operative status and requirements for admission. A further Same Day Admission roll out is planned for interventional radiology patients who were not included in the first phase which will increase the rate of SDA further . 15 The regional major trauma service was further enhanced with the o pening of a new \u00a31m helicopter landing pad in July 2017 on the Aintree University Hospital (AUH) site. The regional trauma centre receives patients from across Cheshire and Merseyside who need urgent specialist care which isn't necessarily available in the ir local hospital. This addition will save vital minutes when transferring trauma and other time critical patients to The Walton Centre which ultimately improves chances of survival and reduces the risk of long-term injury. The division have been focused on strengthening the major incident plans over the past year and have participated in a number of test exercises. The first was held in October 2017; Exercise Brave Defender, which involved all tiers of management on -call, Executive Directors, Clinical Dir ectors, Medical staff, Theatres, Bed Management, Matrons, Critical Care and representatives from AUH . This exercise was designed to test the effectiveness of all departmental major incident action cards and the escalation process. The exercise was held acr oss multiple rooms in the Sid Watkins Building, utilising telephones and radios to simulate the separation of departments including AUH A&E. All staff were briefed only moments before declaration of a major incident, which effectively tested the action ca rds. The exercise was a huge success, with only minor alterations to the a ction cards necessary. AUH teams commented on how well the exercise was facilitated and will be using elements when planning their own exercise. In February 2018, the division unde rtook a mass casualty simulated exercise. This was specifically designed to test the response and capacity of our Theatre department and Critical Care Unit. Staff were only informed moments before the simulated major incident was declared and the bed state on the day was used for the exercise. The exercise was received extremely positively and lots of feedback was collated during the hot debrief. A small working group c ontinues to work through this feedback to improve our mass casualty plan. In March 2018 Aintree University Hospital undertook their first Mass Casualty exercise: Follow the File. This was a huge success and showcased the fantastic collaborative working between both Trusts. Internally, Consultant Neurosurgeons and Anaesthetists participated, along with representatives from Theatres, Critical Care and both Tactical and Strategic command. Again, lots of feedback was provided during the hot debrief and as a collaborative Major Trauma Centre we continue to work through to ensure our plans are robust. A joint simulation exercise for ourselves and Aintree University Hospitals is planned for 2018, involving North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) to further strengt hen our Major Trauma Centre Collaborative Major Incident Plan. NHS England's Quality Surveillance Team undertook the first Peer Review of our Skull Base service, which is provided jointly with ENT specialists from Aintree University Hospital. The formal report is due in Spring 16 2018 however feedback from the reviewers on the day w as overwhelmingly positive and no immediate or major concerns having been highlighted in respect of this service . The reviewers commented on the excellent quality of our documenta tion and the supporting evidence, as well as the patient centred approach that we have adopted. The NERVES trial looking at nerve root block treatment versus surgery for sciatica is a NIHR funded multi - centre trial led by Consultant Neurosurgeon and the Trust 's Clinical Research Director , Mr Martin Wilby , in collaboration with Liverpool University. Recruitment finished in December 2017 with over 160 patients recruited. Follow up of patients is on -going and will continue until December 2018 at whic h point analysis of results will begin, with publication of results due in 2019. The trial will assess efficacy of nerve root block injections for sciatica secondary to a prolapsed lum bar disc and hopefully guide a n ational treatment paradigm for this comm on and disabling condition. Three brain cancer patients benefited from a cutting -edge treatment which creates electrical fields that interfere with cancer cell division. The treatment, called Optune, involves wearing electrodes which disrupt cancer cell d ivision, limiting the size of tumours. Patients with Glioblastoma (GBM), a very aggressive form of brain tumour, have to wear a device for at least 18 hours a day to get the best response from the treatment. Based on the results of a large clinical trial, this treatment, alongside chemotherapy, c ould extend the lifespan of patients with GBM . The aim is to establish if the treatment is acceptable to UK patients, allow clinical colleagues to gain some practical experience with the equipment, to see if it work s with difficult to treat brain cancer and to see if there are ways to make i t more affordable for the UK in the future. Anaesthesia and Critical Care The anaesthetic department received the Anaesthesia Clinical Services Accreditation (ACSA) from the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA) at a ceremony held in February 2018. ACSA is the RCoA's peer - reviewed scheme which promotes quality improvement and the highest standards of patient experience, patient safety and clinical leadership within the anaesth etic service. Our anaesthetic department is the eighth in the North of England and the seventeenth in the UK to receive the prestigious accreditation. The department continue s to proactively seek solutions to the national shortage of medical staffing acro ss all specialties. The successful introduction of Advanced Critical Care Nurse Practitioners (ACCP s) to comple ment the existing roles and ensure that safe care for patients is maintained, has been expanded in year br inging the total number of ACCP s to 4.5 0 WTE. Further expansion is planned in the future. The department was granted permission by the Royal College of Anaesthetists to recruit Anaesthetic Trainees from developing countries. The Medical Training Initiative programme has enabled increased stabil isation 17 of the department 's medical staffing position with the recruitment of 3 additional junior doctors via this programme. As part of the continuing delirium prevention initiative on the Critical Care Unit, cutting -edge technology was installed allo wing patients to visualise the sky to help minimise delirium. The innovative 'Sky View Ceiling System' streams high quality footage of the day and night's sky to help improve patient sleep patterns and thereby reducing the incidence of delirium, a phenomen on of which intensive care p atients are at a higher risk and a complication which hampers rehabilitation. The annual Critical Care peer review visit took place in March 2018. The formal report is expected later in the year however no immediate concerns were identified and the review team commended the department 's preparation for the visit and were extremely i mpressed with the SMART team and the service they deliver to our patients. The Trust has met the ITU Delayed Discharge 2nd year CQUIN. The stretch target has seen performance increase from only 41% of discharged from ITU within 4 hours to over 60% by the end of March 2018. It has been extremely challenging given the support given to neighbouring DGH's as part of our Winter Plan . This support was well received by trusts. Pain Medicine Activity growth continues within the service seeing over 5,000 new patients in 2017/18 and 2,000 elect ive inpatient admissions , compared to 1,900 in 2016/17 . We have strengthened the patient outcome collection for the service, especially within the Spinal Cord Stimulation service. We continue to work on other areas of out come collection to expand and consolidate processes for collection and integrate digital solutions to reduce the reliance on clinical staff time. In September 2017, the clinical leadership of the Pain Service transferred from Dr Manohar Sharma to Dr John W iles. During his time as Clinical Director for the Pain Service Dr Sharma introduced significant changes to clinical practice including development of the Spinal Cord Stimulator pathway in Pain , expansion of the cordotomy provision at the Trust along with significant research collaborating with neuroradiology and neurology. Following the departure of one of our Pain Medicine consultants in 2016 and an un successful recruitment process in 2017, the department have looked at alternative ways to manage the demand, which has been significant over the past 3 years. The team has expanded by two further specialist pain physiotherapists and a further Pain Clinical Fellow, supported via i ndustry. 18 In an age of over prescription of o pioids it has become necessary to expand the inpatient detoxification service. We now see approximately 25 patients per annum who required inpatient detoxification. Our regional Complex Regional Pain S yndrome (CRPS ) service works collaboratively with pain phys iotherapists and pain consultants throughout the region who refer patients with complicated CRPS to us. In March a meeting was held and hosted by Dr Goebel, for regional pain health care professional s who work alongside us to network and share update s. A bespoke e -referral system for the Pain Service was successfully launched in May 2017 . Pain service colleagues worked with the Trust IT department to design the system which provides a robust audit trail, reduces the risk of refer ral loss and the time taken to action referrals. The 33rd Liverpool Annual Pain course on the Management of Chronic Pain was held in July 2017, supported by The Pain Relief Foundation. The practical and interactive course was attended by a range of disciplines including Con sultants, GP's, Anaesthetist s, Nurses and Physiotherapists (from the UK and internationally ) and offered the opportunity for attendees to develop their skills of assessing and treating complex chronic pain patients . This continues to receive excellent feed back fro m delegates. The department participated in a research project aimed at patients with severe and disabling lower back pain which is beginning to look optimistic. An implantable device is used for 30 minutes twice a day to reactivate the muscles in the lower back aiming to relieve back pain, caused by inactivity of the multifidus muscle, potentially avoiding the need for surgery. There are 11 patients enrolled on the study at The Walton Centre . Pain Management Programme (PMP) Referrals into the programme have seen a 6.5% increase and the number of medical conversion clinics are due to expand in early 2018/19 to ensure we can assess patients as timely as possible . The year has been a challenging one in terms of RTT achievement w ithin the sub -speciality and it may be that the MDT assessment clinic capacity also needs to be expanded if referrals continue to increase. We offer the following range of PMPs for people experiencing chronic pain : Intensive 16 day Pain Management Program me with outpatient and residential options 5 day Pain Management Programme Chronic Pelvic Pain Management Programme Young Adult Pain Management Programme (approx. 18 -25 years) Facial Pain Management Programme Individualised Pain Management Programme for more complex needs that cannot be met in a group based PMP setting 19 In addition, as one of the selected 'Vanguards' for the New Care Models Programme which is playing a key part in the delivery of the Five Year Forward View , The Neuro Network have worked wi th the Pain Management Team within the Trust over the past year to develop a Community Pain Management Programme (CPMP). The programme forms part of a wider package of care in line with NHS England's National Back and Radicular Pain Pathway, designed to en sure patients get faster access to the treatment they need. Phase one of the roll out is located in Warrington for Warrington CCG patients and began accepting referrals in February 2018, with the first Programme due to run i n April 2018. Patients with chronic pain can currently be referred to the programme via the newly established Treat and Triage service in Warrington, which commenced in September 2017 as part of the Vanguard programme. The PMP was awarded the top prize at the annual Gr\u00fcnenthal P ain Awards , winning \u00a310,000 for the second time . The seventh annual Gr\u00fcnenthal Pain Awards aimed to recognise excellence in the field of innovative pain management. The department have used the funding to produce a booklet aimed at helping children and rel atives of people with chronic pain understand their condition better , as well as projects related to the use of technology in pain management rehab ilitation . Selina Johnson, a Pain and Neuromodulation Specialist Physiotherapist at the Trust, was awarded 'C linical Research Rising Star of the Year' at The North West Coast Research and Innovation Awards 2018. This category recognised the work of an individual new to research who had achieved a significant amount in a short space of time. The Neuroscience Labo ratories Following the departure of both Consultant Neuropathologists during 2016/17 due to retirement and relocat ion, the department have faced significant challenges but manged to maintain all clinical services during the recruitment process for Consultant replacements with robust S ervice Level Agreements (SLA's) in place with other providers. The Trust has successfully recruited to both posts, welcoming one consultant neuropathologist in May 2017, with the second due to start in July 2018. The co nsultants are supported by a full time Consultant Clinical Scientist and Laboratory Director. Following United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) accreditation in 2015; The Neuroscience Laboratories had their second annual surveillance visit by UKAS in November 2017 and successfully maintained accreditation. During this process, further specialist neuro diagnostic work was added to the accreditation scope of the services provided, evidence submitted and assessed, which resulted in full accreditation acr oss the new scope. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) BioBank repository was launched in 2017 with the purpose of collecting and storing samples and relevant clinical information for use in current and future neurological research projects. It allows our clin icians active in research, and also other researchers nationally and internationally, increased access to samples when conducting important research into neurological diseases, including 20 Dementia and Parkinson's, and the treatments of those diseases. Patie nts undergoing routine tests are asked to donate CSF and blood to be included in the Biobank with samples taken at the same time as their test, making the donation quick and easy for consenting patients. The department are currently implementing the Natio nal Pathology Exchange (NPEx) software, which provides digital integration of UK laboratories enabling pathology test requests and results to be sent from any lab to any lab in a matter of seconds. Prior to this technology, our method of receiving referred work and outsourcing was dependent on a paper based system. This development wi ll result in reduced turnaround times, reduced risk of transcription errors, income generation potential and added visibility of tests by Provider showing price and performance data enabling informed decision making in order to get the best quality and most efficient service for patients. Division of Neurology The Neurology Division continues to deliver a responsive specialist service to patients both in the centre and at part ner Trusts and community settings via an outreach service. This model of care was chosen as a NHS acute care collaboration Vanguard site, allowing its further development to improve the level of neurology services provided to patients closer to their homes. The Neurology Service provides a responsive specialist service to patients acro ss Cheshire, Merseyside, North Wa les and Isle of Man, from both The Walton Centre and at partner Trusts and community settings via an outreach service. The network of satellite clinics operates from 15 acute hospitals, providing both an outpatient service and support to inpatients. It is a large and busy neurology service seeing 30 ,383 new patients in 2017/18 and treat ing 4 ,932 inpatients, in either The Walton Centre 's day case unit or on its inpatient ward. The neurology service is delivered by a multi -skilled professional team. There are 41 Consultants, 25 specialist nurses, who work alongside an experienced therapy team to provide the holistic and multidisciplinary care required for our patients. Sub -speciality clinics are provided in epilepsy, movement disorders, headache, neuromuscular, multiple sclerosis, vascular and neuromyelitis optica. The service expanded its geographical footprint in 2017/18, entering into a sub -contract with Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Foundation Trust to support their adult neurology service. The Walton Centre now supports fortnightly clinics from this hospital. As with most other clinical specialities, neurology continues to see a year-on-year increase in demand for services . Having a robust workforce plan to ensure the successful recruitment of new colleagues to the service is critical to meet the ever growing demand. The service successfully recruited and welcomed a further two consultant neurologist s during 2017 /18; one in the area of headache and one in epilepsy . Epilepsy is one of the larger areas of g rowth due to the success of embedding the post seizure pathway into A&E departments and ensuring that patients who need to be under specialist care after experiencing a 21 seizure are . In addition, the service introduced a new Clinical Fellow post within movement disorders. This post allows the Trust to support individuals to develop their sub -specialty interest and ensure the development of Consultants in this area for the futu re. The Cochrane Epilepsy Group continues to be based in Liverpool. There remains a high national and international profile with awards of NIHR grants and close collaboration with the European Brain Council. There continues to be major interest in the service delivery of epilepsy, the genetics of epilepsy, MRI scanning and the drug treatment of epilepsy including issues associated with prescribing valproate in pregnancy. As previously outlined, The Walton Centre was chosen to lead an Acute Care Collabo rative Vanguard - The Neuro Network under NHS England's New Care Models of Care Programme. This opportunity is facilitating and seeing a number of developments within the neurology service to enhance its current satellite model with community support, rollout of clinical pathways and increasing the advice and support available for primary and secondary care. 2017/18 is the final year of central funding for t his programme and therefore many projects have matured a nd become embedded to continue as 'business as usual ' into 2018/19. A summary of the projects are as follows: r ollout and embedment of a post seizure and headache pathway; nurse advice line; i ntegrated neurology nurse d isorder clinics; tele-neurology and E ducation to both primary care and secondary care colleagues. Many of the projects are interrelated, designed to improve access to neurology services / expertise, reduce avoidable admissions and shorten length of stay an d support earlier diagnosis and treatment for patients . One of the most significant developments within neurology during the year, has been the services leadership of expanding the mechanical thrombectomy service for stroke patients across Cheshire and Merseyside. Mechanical thrombectomy is a momentous develop ment in the treatment of stroke demonstrating significantly improved outcomes; for every four to six patients who undergo a thrombectomy following stroke, one more will be able to function independent ly at 90 days compared to those that receive intravenous (IV) thrombolysis ('clot busting' drugs) alone. It is a relatively new procedure and with its strong evidence -base, NHS England are looking to commissioning the service routinely and see this treatm ent available 24/7 over the next five to ten years. As one of the 24 neuroscience centres within England and already providing a weekday thrombectomy service, The Walton Centre has started work to expand this service, both outside of standard working hours during the week and plans for introducing during the weekend. Therapy Services The newly extended Neuromuscular Disease therapy outpatient service was successfully evaluate d after a nine month pilot period and has now introduced a number of new multidisciplinary / t herapy clinics and patient groups for education in condition management, occu pational performance, exercise and 22 employment . The service going forward will also be extended to patients with Parkinson' s Disease and Motor Neurone D isease ( MND ). As reflected in the development above, t he therapies outpatient service reflects the emerging national strategy of improving multi -disciplinary team access for people living with long term neurological conditions. Aligned to this and as part of the Vanguard Programme, the service has also contributed to developing a project aimed at improving access to exercise and activity for people with neurologica l disorders. Engagement events have been held between community teams, service users, providers and the public to make health and leisure facilities accessible and the service has been part of a successful bid for funding from Sport England to develop neurology based training for leisure centre staff. The department has continued to be actively involved in research and development with several therapy based projects underway. Several members of the therapy team are currently undertaking post -graduate resear ch degrees includ ing Masters in Research and PhD s. The Therapy Service has just been shortlisted for a 'Culture of Innovation' Award hosted by the North West Coasts Research and Innovation Collaboration and one of our Occupational Therapy staff has been sh ortlisted in the 'Research Student of the Year' category. During 2017/18, t he Therapies service has extend ed a project started by our 'Ideas Forums ,' which involves hosting and delivering in -house course s for external health care professionals. These cours es increase the profile of the service , improve collaborative links with other professionals and organisations and allow wider dissemination of expert knowledge. Following the success of the 'Physiotherapy Respiratory' Training Course hosted in March 2017 , the therapy service as a whole delivered a 'Specialist Therapy Study' day in March 2018. Complex Rehabilitation The Walton Centre is both the host and hub of the Cheshire and Merseyside Rehabilitation Network formed in January 2013 to integrate complex rehabilitation services from hyper acute to community in the region. The Rehabilitation Network is a unique collaboration of seven partner organisations; The Walton Centre has two rehabilitation units, hyper acute (level 1a) and level 1b and there are four spoke units across the region at The Walton Centre , St. Helens Hospital, Broadgreen Hospital and Clatterbridge Hospital, who all provide inpatient beds f or level 2 rehabilitation. There is one unit, Oak Vale Gardens, for level 3 rehabilitation with continuing rehabilitation provided by the specialist rehabilitation community services. The aim of the Network is to work in partnership across seven providers to deliver a high quality, fully co - ordinated and seamless pathway of care, of supported, active and extended rehabilitation with a multidisciplinary team of medical, therapy and nursing staff. The team is supported by other specialists in key areas such as rehabilitation co -ordination, clinical and neuropsychology, neuro psychiatry, vocational rehabilitation therapy, social support and clerical / administrative / managerial staff. Patients accessing the Network do so based on need not diagnosis following t raumatic injury or illness. 23 The annual Cheshire a nd Merseyside Rehabilitation Network (CMRN) Values for staff award ceremony was held in April 2017 to recognise staff . During 2017/18 there was an emphasis on patient flow and the Network developed regular groups to identify delays and put in place strategies that aimed to reduce delays where possible. Moving forward into 2018/19 the Network will continue to work with the NHS England case manager to further reduce external delays . Managers and Clinical Leads continue to attend workshops and conferences nationally to showcase the work of the Network and this included a presentation given to the Welsh Neurosciences Board in September 2017. During the year v isitors from Leeds and Manchester came to the Hub to re view and discuss the model and benchmark their services against the Network model. 1st November 2017 saw the transfer of the Clinical Psychology Network team from Merseycare NHS Foundation Trust to The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust. This will provide a more integrated service for the patents across the Network. A process mapping exercise took place in January 2018 wit h the Acquired Brain Injury service delivered by Merseycare NHS Foundation Trust . This workshop identified the gaps and the differences in the pathways and work will continue with the commissioners to look at how these gaps can be addressed. The Education Group completed its development of a Masters level Complex Rehabilitation Module which was accre dited for three years by Liverpool John Moores University. The first cohort of this module ran from September to December 2017 with very positive feedback. The Network ha s been approached by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board to deliver the module to a cohort of their staff and this wa s planned to start in March 2018. After an independent review in 2015 commissioned by the six Merseyside Clinical Commissioning Group s, work has been ongoing to review both the provider and commissioner model. A workshop was held in February 2018 with all stakeholders from providers, CCG's and NHS England attending to further explore the agreed Strategic Priority set in January 2017 to develop and embed a single provider and commissioner model. CMRN held its inaugural Qual ity Partnership Event in March 2018. There were six verbal presentations and 21 poster presentations that showcase d the projects, audit and best practice from across the Network. Neuropsychology During 2017/18, the department continued to see patients benefit from the new assessment and treatment service for people diagnosed with a functional neurological disorder. The service is currently being evaluated as part of the Vanguard Programme and hope fully the early success of this service will in the longer -term result in an expanded service to accommodate more complex patients who require longer treatment lengths than the current model allows. A recent and exciting development for this service is a 24 new assessment pathway that leads to focused inpatient treatment for those patients with functional weakness that require physiotherapy as well as psychotherapy. A Consultant in Rehabilitation Medicine now regularly attends the monthly Functional MDT to fa cilitate this patient pathway. The Neuropsychology team continue to support other services and staff groups. A training workshop was developed for the Patient Experience Team on dealing with difficult telephone calls (e.g. when the patient expresses suici dal thoughts or intent) on both a practical (what to say/do) and personal level (how to manage the emotional consequences of talking with a person threatening suicide and building personal resilience). This workshop was a joint collaboration developed and provided by Neuropsychology and Neuropsychiatry. The workshop was very well received. In addition, the department continues to support the \"R oad to Recovery\" event for patients who have had subarachnoid haemorrhage. The Neuropsychology team are committed to supporting training for Psychology and Neuropsychology within the region and beyond. The team has strong links with Liverpool, Manchester, Lancashire and Bristol Universities and provides both placements for trainees and also specialist lectures on th eir courses. The department continues to maintain a high level of research activity. Two multicentre randomised controlled trials (RCT) delivering neuropsychological interventions were successfully completed in the past year. The department has begun a new multicentre RCT in herpes simplex encephalitis. In the past year we have conducted collaborative research with several major research p artners including Liverpool, Manchester and Nottingham Universities and Salford Royal Foundation Trust and continue a range of projects including epilepsy, neuro -oncology and NMO research studies. We continue to develop high quality research programmes tha t have included leading and participating in Cochrane systematic reviews as well as contributing to grant applications for new programmes. Neuroradiology A new intraoperative MRI scanner was opened during 2017/18, with s everal intra operative surgical case s performed successfully during the year . The cases performed include brain tumours and pituitary adenomas, with initial positive feedback and improved outcomes for patients . The opening of the new iMRI has also allowed additional scanning capacity for inp atients when the scanner isn't in use for intra-operative cases . 2017/18 also saw the procurement of a mobile O arm for use in theatre . Along with the theatre navigation system this has allowed 3D imaging in the theatre environment to support complex spinal procedures and again improve the outcomes for patients. The Department successfully recruited and welcomed a 10th Consultant Neuroradiologist into the workforce towards the end of year , and continue to develop an Advanced Practitioner Radiographer role in Fluoroscopy. 25 Neuroradiology is a member of the Cheshire and Merseyside Five Year Forward View Programme, and was successful in its application to NHS Improvement to be selected as an Early Adopter site for the Stroke Pathway . Neurophysiology Demand for all Neurophysiology investigations in 2017/18 remained high. Historically there have been long waiting times for long -term Electroencephalography ( EEG ) monitoring (ambulatory monitoring and video telemetry ) and work has taken place during the year to improve this situation. The service have reviewed the referral criteria for these investigations and, in addition, introduced specific EEG clinics for patients referred with non -epileptic attack disorders (NEAD). This has led to a recent reduction in waiting times for long-term EEG monitoring. Demand for electromyography (EMG) also continues to be significant. Despite an international shortage of Consultant Neurophysiologists, the service successfully recruited two Consultants on zero hour contracts to assist in managing EMG waiting times during the year . Neurophysiology continued to work towards a nationally recognised accreditation standard called Improving Quality in Physiological Services (IQIPS) managed by United Kingdom Accreditation System ( UKAS). Achieving the standard will recognise and provide assurance of excellent quality and care. The work undertaken to date , for the self - assessment, has provided opportunities to evidence areas of good practice already embedded in service delivery. Pharmacy Pharmacy services are provided via a service level agreement with Aintree University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, and the service continues to develop year on year. The pharmacist prescribing service, which started in 2016/17, has been extende d during 2017/18, with pharmacists playing a key role in the same day admission process for elective surgical patients, which started in May 2017. Two pharmacists are now on duty early each morning Monday to Friday to review all patients admitted that morn ing for surgery and prescribe their usual medicines, ensuring any necessary changes peri -operatively are actioned. This service has been well received but has impacted on the availability of pharmacist prescribers for surgical ward rounds and prescribing f or existing inpatients. The ITU pharmacist has also qualified as a prescriber which has enhanced the service to ITU patients , and added some resilience to the same day admissions service. Audit and review of the pharmacist prescribing service is currently underway to evaluate its success, impact and potential for further development, and a full report will be presented in quarter one 2018/19. Pharmacy have refined last year's work on the management of medicines which are dispensed and delivered to patients via external homecare companies, in keeping with national standards. Further improvements to systems have been implemented this year to improve patient safety and clinical/financial 26 governance, and Pharmacy also check Blueteq approval is in place for spec ified high cost medicines for multiple sclerosis as per NHS England requirements. The wider role of pharmacists within The Walton Centre has expanded this year, with senior pharmacist representation newly requested at various Trust groups, committees and i nitiatives. In addition , the contribution of individual clinical pharmacists and technicians to patient safety was recognised with two 'good catch' awards to pharmacy staff this year. Estates and Facilities The Trust brought the \u00a38.1 m Theatres/iMRI development fully into use in April 2017. This has created two additional operating theatres, one of which has a direct access into a n addition MRI scanner to enable scans to take place during a procedure . The Trust, again, rated highly in the annual Pat ient Led Assessments out of 279 NHS providers. Going concern disclosure Following extensive enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the NHS Foundation Trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeabl e future. They have identified no material uncertainties that cast doubt on the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. Hayley Citrine , Chief Executive 25 May 2018 27 2ii Performance Report - performance analysis The purpose of the performance report is to highlight the most important performance measures for the trust. The most significant performance areas are: quality and patient safety, finance and activity including referral to treatment targets. These are considered in detail below. Financial Summary for the Year Ended 31 March 2018 The Trust delivered a \u00a3 6,122 k surplus for the financial year ending 31 March 2018. This position includes non-recurrent Sustainability and Transformation funding of \u00a33,322k, which consists of \u00a31,609k funding for meeting agreed financial and non -financial targets during the year and \u00a3 1,713 k 'bonus and incentive ' funding for achievement and over performance of t he planned year -end position . The position also includes a charitable donation in relation to a new robotic arm of \u00a3164k, as well as a reversal of prior year impairments of \u00a3650k (as a result of a full revaluation of the Trust Estate) . 2017/18 has continued to be a challenging year for the Trust and is reflective of the difficult circumstances facing the NHS and the wider health economy. The Trust has faced significant challenges with regard to patient acuity which has required one to one therapeutic specialing care (one nurse or one healthcare assistant to one patient and sometimes two to one in some instances). Investment in a dedicated, substantive healthcare assistant nursing ' pool' for specialing in 2016/17 led to a planned reduction on the nurse agency expenditure during 2017/18 resulting in agency expenditure being below the NHSI cap , although pressure on this area of spend continues. The Trust has also faced activity and per formance challenges as a result of delayed transfers of patients to general hospitals as a result of pressures across the local health economy, as well as delayed discharges due to the complexity of patients. The identification and delivery of recurrent efficiency savings has also proved a challenge for the organisation during 2017/18. Table 1 sets out the reconciliation of the annual accounts to the Trust's Normalised Trading Surplus for the year ended 31 March 2018. Table 1 \u00a3'000 Surplus for the year per statement of comprehensive income 6,122 Normalisation adjustment: Capital donation from the Charitable Fund (164) Reversal of impairment on Sid Watkins Building (650) Normalised Trading Surplus (including STF) 5,308 Normalisation The NHS Improvement Compliance Framework measures Trusts ' performance on the underlying or normalised trading position of the Trust after allowing for the adjustment of exceptional items that are one off in nature and not related to the core routine business of th e Trust. 28 Revaluation of Trust Property During 2017/18 a full revaluation of the Trust 's land and buildings was undertaken by an independent external valuer, in which the value of Trust land and properties increased resulting in a \u00a3650k prior year net impairment being reversed in full as well as an increase in the revaluation reserve by \u00a33,561k . The revaluation is a technical accounting adjustment which has no impact on the Trust's cash position (as it is a non-cash item) or its overall reported performanc e to NHS Improvement (as the adjustment is normalised) in the financial statements (see above) . Income The Trust has seen i ncome (turnover) growth o f \u00a38.6 million from the previous year (year ending 31 March 2018 ) which represents a 7.2% increase. Of this growth, \u00a32.5m is non -recurrent. The Trust recei ves the largest element of its i ncome from NHS England for the provision of Specialised Prescribed Services, the scope and coverage of which can be found in section 8 of thi s report. The Trust receive d \u00a395 .0 million from NHS England/ CCGs in the year ending 31 March 2018, an increase of \u00a37 .2 million ( 8.2%) on the previous financial year. This reflects a change to national specialised tariffs, increased acuity of patients treated by the organisation as well as additional agreed contract activity undertaken by the Trust on behalf of NHS England/ CCGs. In addition, the Trust receives \u00a317.1 million of income from Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee (WHSSC) for provision of services to the populati on of (mainly) North Wales, both through outreach clinics held within hospitals within Wales and for Welsh patients attending The Walton Centre , either as an out - patient or in -patient. This reflects a 14% increase from the previous yea r, which is in the ma in due to the new HRG4+ tariff as well as patient complexity and acuity. The Trust also receives other amounts of income from different sources and these ar e set out in the following pie chart : 29 Expenditure In line with the growth in income (turnover), the Trust has seen an increa se in Operating Expenses of \u00a36.9 million (6.1 %) compared to the previous year. The following pie chart sets out the main components of expenditure incurred by the Trust in 2017/18. 65.3%13.6%2.7%0.7%0.1%0.4% 13.6%3.6%Income 2017/18 NHS England England : 2.7% Foundation Trust : 0.7% NHS Trust : 0.1% Department of Health and Social Care : 0.4% Other NHS Bodies : 2.2% 30 The biggest single item of expenditure incur red by the Trust relates to employment of staff to deliver the range of services provided by the Trust. The Trust spent \u00a366.4 million on staffing during 2017/18 w hich wa s an increase of \u00a33.1 million (4.9 %) on the previous year . This was due to planned inve stments in staffing in relation to the new theatres and i ntraoperative MRI machine that have been built and to ensure compliance with medical rotas (to maintain safe services) as well as the transfer of rehabilitation staff into the organisation . However, as noted above, some of this also related to patient acuity and the necessity of delivering more one to one therapeutic specialing. The average number of whole time equivalent (WTE) staff has increased by 17 from the previous year. The majority of the increase in whole time equivalent numbers is due to the TUPE transfer of rehabilitation staff into the organisation and planned investments in staffing following the full operationalisation of the i ntraoperative MRI scanner. Tables 2 and 3 show staff costs and average number of employees for 2016/17 and 2017/18.

To assist in facilitating the necessary changes and efficiencies, and due to a number of staff requesting such a scheme, a time limited Mutuall y Agreed Resignation Scheme (MARS) was introduced during 2017/18. The scheme was approved by NHS Improvement and adhered to national Agenda for Change terms a nd conditions of service.

Within the financial plan set at the start of the financial year was the requirement to deliver \u00a33.9 million of efficiency savings to ensure the ove rall delivery of the control total (financial 'target' set by NHS Improvement, delivery of which secures access to Sustainability and Transformation funding) . As at 31 March 2018 the Trust had achieved \u00a32.8m of recurrent savings, which represents 72% of th e planned level. This represents 2.3 % of the Trusts operating expenses. \u00a31.1m of recurrent savings were not delivered during 2017/18 but additional savings were found through a number of non -recurrent measures . All identified savings schemes are subject to Quality Impact Assessments (QIA) and approved by the Medical Director and Director of Nursing to ensure that there is no adve rse impact on patient safety, quality and patient experience. Investments in Trust Infrastructure and Equipment The Trust spent \u00a3 3.3m of capital expenditure in 2017/18. Expenditure during the year included an equipment replacement programme and the progression of the Trust 's Digital S trategy. The capital programme is guided by principles of patient safety, business continuity/ servi ce delivery and clinical developments in line with the Trust's strategy. Table 7 sets out the major components of the Trust's capital investment expenditure programme for the year ended 31st March 2018.

They have identified no material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on the Trust' s ability to continue as a going concern. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. The main factors in reaching this conclusion are: The Trust's latest financial plan forecasts a surplus position across t he coming financial year; Projected cash balances are sufficient to sustain the capital investment programme and meet short term operating costs. The Trust has sufficient cash headroom to support its plans; There is no expectation for short term loans or o verdraft facilities; Auditors' opinions have provided assurance as to the accuracy and reliability of the Trust's financial systems and the robustness of the internal controls. Forward Look The financial year 2018/19 will be another challenging year for the NHS as a whole. Plans are in place to ensure that the Trust will continue to deliver against its terms of licence as a Foundation Trust by delivering excellent, safe, high quality patient care. The control total proposed by NHS Improvement is a \u00a33. 0m surplus and the Trust has set plans to achieve this. This predicted performance is driven by the continued increase in historic referral trends but delivered in an efficient and effective manner. The plan includes a cost improvement programme of \u00a33.2 mi llion, with year -end cash balances projected to be c.\u00a321.7 million. The Trust had been the lead as an acute care Vanguard site in 2016/17 and 2017/18, however central funding for this project ended on 31st March 2018 . The Trust will receive no further funding in 2018/19 from NHS England although large elements of the project have been adopted by the Trust and the wider health economy (\u00a31.75 million was received in 2017/18).

These can be broadly categorised int o the following 4 main headings: Productivity : ensuring the performance levels necessary to meet patient demand and continue to deliver acc ess targets a nd financial plans; Workforce : recruitment , retention and succession planning of the right workforce at the right time to deliver the increase in activity; Healthcare acquired infections : continued control of infections and manageme nt of newly emerging infections; Commissioner decisions : the funding available to commissioners and how/where commissioning decisions are taken: o In 2017/18 a block contract has been agreed with North Mersey CCG's as part of an 'Acting as one' arrangement across the North Mers eyside region, for a period of 2 years. This means that non -specialist activity levels are fixed to 2017/18 block plus 1% (with 2017/18 block being based on 2016/17 outturn plus 1%). A ny performance above this level will not be funded and as such creates s ome risk if referr als exceed agreed growth levels; o Changes to the tariff were introduced in 2017/18 which recognised the increased cost of providing specialist services. Debate continues with Welsh Commissioners regarding the increased charges relating to HRG4+. There is a continued risk on this element of income although NHS Improvement/ NHS England are aware of this and are in regular dialogue with Welsh C ommissioners to come to a satisfactory conclusion with regard to funding this activity. Principal R isks The principal risks facing the Trust are: Failure to achieve CIP financial plans in accordance with the strategic plan; Failure to deliver financial stability in the medium term due to changes in the NHS economic environment e.g. tariff changes; Failure of Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee to pay tariffs at HRG4+ levels; Failure to meet neurosurgery and pain RTT targets required by NHS Improvement and NHS England; Shortfall in clinical capacity to meet anticipated demand with reliance on short term, premium rate methods to deliver key performance targets. The above risks have been assessed and have been rated between 9 and 16. Risks rated below 16 are reported in the annual governance statement. All these risks are recorded on the Board Assurance Framework. 36 During 2017/18 the Trust experienced a signifi cant reduction in violent and aggressive incidents from patients against staff. These incidents were dealt with on an individual basis with staff and patient safety being considered a priority. Staff were suppor ted throughout all the events. In order to maintain this reduction, t he Trust has invested in , and successfully appointed , an internal violence and aggression trainer, who commenced in post 1st April 2018. This will ensure that staff have all the relevant competencies in dealing with challenging pa tients in real-time. Also, this will provide a support mechanism to staff and ensure that all actions, including the use of sanctions, are used when required. 2017/18: Activity During 2017/18, the Trust's activity has decreased by 3.51% in comparison to 2016/17. There has been a decrease in elective activity of 3.39% and a decrease of 3.21% in day cases, but a n increase in non - elective activity of 1.99% when compared to 2016/17 . Summary of Activity Table 8 shows activity for 2017/18 compared to previous years. Table 8 Bed Occupancy Rates Bed occupancy is measured in line with the relevant national definition and reflects occupancy at midnight. This can vary by 1 -3% from the measurement of occupancy levels at other times throughout the day. Overall for 2017/18 the average bed occupancy for the Trust's main wards (i.e. excluding Critical Care and the Complex Rehabilitation Unit (C RU)) was 83.98%, a decrea se of 2.98% on 2016/17. Table 9 below gives the breakdown of occupancy rates for 2016/17 and 2017/18 .

Senior Managers' Remuneration policy Future Policy table The table is contained in the report within section 3, and does not have any particular arrangements which are specific to any individual senior manager. Directors' Contracts, Terms and Conditions Executive and Corporate Directors' contracts are permanent on appointment and new Executive and Corporate Directors are subject to a period of six months' notice and are entitled to NHS redundancy payments should their posts be made redundant. Policy on Payment for Loss of Office The Trust has standard NHS contracts of employment. The Trust's Remuneration Committee in March 2015 introduced a four point scale for each of the executive director posts . Table 14 represents the Senior Manager * b reakdown by male and female as at 31 March 2018 : Table 14 MALE 8 FEMALE 33 TOTAL 41 *Band 8b and above (excluding medical staff and senior clinical staff with no departmental management responsibility) Annual Report on Remuneration Directors Remuneration Executive and corporate directors' terms and conditions of service and salaries are determined by the Trust's Remuneration Committee. When determining the terms and conditions of executive and corporate directors the Remuneration C ommittee set pay in comparison to salaries in other foundation and specialist trusts across the local health economy. 50 Non-executive directors' remuneration is determined by the Governor Nominations Committee who make their recommendations to the Council of Governors. The Trust's Policy on Pay The Trust employs the majority of staff on national Agenda for Change or Co nsultant Contract Terms and Conditions. This is national policy and therefore a local Trust policy is not applicable. How the national policy is applied locally is agreed through the Trust's Staff Partnership Committee and Local Negotiating Committee (for medical staff). Director remuneration (for voting and non -voting directors) is agreed through the Trust's Remuneration Committee as outlined in the Remuneration Committee's terms of reference. Where senior managers were paid in excess of \u00a3150,0001 the T rust has reviewed the remuneration in relation to the duties performed and remuneration paid in similar organisations for similar roles and has concluded that the remuneration is fair and reasonable. REMUNERATION REPORT Fair Pay Multiple The Trust is required to disclose the relationship between the remuneration of the highest paid director and the median remuneration of the Trust's workforce. The median remuneration of the employees paid by The Walton Centre is \u00a330,135 (2016/17: \u00a329,333). The highest paid director is the Medical Director who received \u00a3173,868 remuneration (2016/17: \u00a3163,172). This is 5.7 times the median remuneration (2016/17: 5.7 times). In 2017/18, 5 employees, all doctors, received remuneration in excess of the highest paid direct or (2016/17 : 10 employees, all doctors). Remuneration ranged from \u00a313,792 ( 2016/17 : \u00a311,637) to \u00a3194,529 lowest paid employe e in 2017/18 was an apprentice. Total remuneration (found in tables 15 and 16 below) includes salary, non -consolidated performance related pay and benefits in kind. It does not include severance payments, employer pension contributions and the cash equivalent transfer value of pensions. 1 \u00a3150,000 is the threshold used in the Civil Service for approval by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, as set out in guidan ce issued by the Cabinet Office. The Cabinet Office approvals process does not apply to NHS foundation trusts but is considered a suitable benchmark above which NHS foundation trusts should make this disclosure. 51 Table 15 Remuneration and Pension Entitlements of Senior Managers (subject to audit) 1 April 2017 - 31 March 2018 1 April 2016 - 31 March 2017 Name Position Salaries and Fees Taxable Benefits Pension Related Benefits Total Salaries and Fees Taxable Benefits Pension Related Benefits Total \u00a3000 (Bands of \u00a35,000) (Bands of \u00a35,000) (Nearest \u00a300) (Bands of \u00a32,500) (Bands of \u00a35,000) Burns M Director of Finance 110 - 115 0 35 - 37.5 145 - 150 105 - 110 0 42.5 - 45.0 145 - 150 Citrine H Director of Nursing and Mode rnisation (to 31/08/16); Director of Nursing, Operations and Quality (from 01/09/16); Chief Executive (from 01/02/18) 120 - 125 0 62.5 - 65 185 - 190 115 - 120 0 50.0 - 52.5 165 - 170 Crofts S Non-Executive Director 10 - 15 0 N/A - N/A 10 - 15 10 - 15 0 N/A - N/A 10 - 15 Enevoldson P Medical 0 N/A - N/A 85 - 90 Gibney M Director of Workforce 90 - 95 0 15 - 17.5 105 - 110 90 - 95 0 82.5 - 85.0 170 - 175 Harrop C Chief Executive (to 31/01/18) 130 - 135 0 32.5 - 35 165 - 170 155 - 160 200 110.0 - 112.5 265 - 270 Hoskisson K - 45 1,400 N/A - N/A 45 - 50 Humphrey P Non-Executive Director 10 - 15 0 N/A - N/A 10 - 15 10 - 15 700 N/A - N/A 10 - 15 McCracken A Non-Executive Director 15 - 20 400 N/A - N/A 15 - 20 10 - 15 500 N/A - N/A 10 - 15 Moore S Director of Strategy and Planning; Director of Strategy and Planning/Deputy Chief Executive and Director reponsible for Operations and Performance (from 01/02/18) 105 - 110 0 25 - 27.5 130 - 135 105 - 110 0 32.5 - 35.0 140 - 145 Nicolson A * Medical Director (from 01/09/16) 170 - 175 0 325 - 327.5 495 - 500 100 105 0 N/A - N/A 100 105 Rosser J Non-Executive Director (to 31/10/16); Chair (from 01/04/17) 40 - 45 2,600 N/A - N/A 45 - 50 5 - 10 500 N/A - N/A 5 - 10 52 Salter L Acting Director of Nursing and Governance (from 01/02/18) 15 - 20 0 12.5 - 15.0 25 - 30 N/A N/A - Director 10 - 15 500 N/A - N/A 10 - 15 10 - 15 400 N/A - N/A 10 - 15 Sharples A Non-Executive Director 15 - 20 700 N/A - N/A 15 - 20 15 - 20 900 N/A - N/A 15 - 20 Wood J Director of Operations and Performance (to 31/08/16) N/A - N/A N/A N/A 180 - 185 0 30.0 - 32.5 210 - 215 The salaries and fees for A Nicolson and P Enevoldson include remuneration for their clinical Nicolson became Medical Director on September 2016, the current increase in his pension related benefits largely reflec ts the fact that a full -year's entitlement in 2017/18 is being compared to a partial -year in 2016/17.

A further \u00a36k was agreed to be paid to a former Director in 2017/18 which will be paid in 2018/19 due to a calculation error in relation to the o riginal payment for loss of office made in 2016/17. No payments have been made to people who have previously been Directors in the Trust in either period. 53 Table 16 Pension Benefits (subject to audit) Name Position Real Increase in Pension at Pension Age Real Increase in Pension Lump Sum at Pension Age Total Accrued Pension at Pension Age at 31 March 2018 Lump Sum at Pension Age Related to Accrued Pension at 31 March 2018 Cash Equivalent Transfer Value at 31 March 2 018 Real Increase in Cash Equivalent Transfer Value Cash Equivalent Transfer Value at 31 March 2017 Employer's Contribution to Stakeholder Pension (Bands of \u00a32,500) (Bands (Bands of \u00a35,000) \u00a3'000 \u00a3'000 \u00a3'000 \u00a3'000 Burns M Director of Finance 2.5 - 5.0 0.0 - 2.5 15.0 - 20.0 0.0 - 5.0 188 35 151 0 Citrine H Director of Nursing and Modernisation (to 31/08/16); Director of Nursing, Operations and Quality (from 01/09/16); Chief Executive (from 01/02/18) 2.5 - 5.0 20.0 - 22.5 40.0 - 45.0 125.0 - 130.0 785 124 655 0 Gibney M Director of Workforce 0.0 - 2.5 0.0 - 2.5 40.0 - 45.0 0.0 - 5.0 605 46 553 0 Harrop C* Chief Executive (to 31/01/18) 0.0 - 2.5 0.0 - 2.5 55.0 - 60.0 145.0 - 150.0 1,021 71 926 0 Moore S Director of Strategy and Planning; Director of Strategy and Planning/Deputy Chief Executive and Director reponsible for Operations and Performance (from 01/02/18) 0.0 - 2.5 0.0 - 2.5 40.0 - 45.0 110.0 - 115.0 778 64 706 0 Nicolson A Medical Director 15.0 - 17.5 35.0 - 37.5 35.0 - 40.0 85.0 - 90.0 543 249 290 0 Salter L* Acting Director of Nursing and Governance (from 01/02/18) 0.0 - 2.5 0.0 - 2.5 25.0 - 30.0 60.0 - 65.0 381 10 318 0 H Citrine and M Gibney opted out of the NHS Pension Scheme on the 31 January 2018.

Education and Organisational Development Supporting the Trust's str ategic plan the organisation continues to be highly committed to promote excellence in education and training to ensure it delivers the highest calibre of health care staff for future NHS patients. The role of the Education team is to support the org anisation to provide education, training and development opportunities to develop current workforce and to support the talent of the future. The Trust retained its IIP Gold status in 2017 and the Trust's commitment to developing its staff was recognised. Education and organisational development initiatives from the last 12 months include: Cohorts 11 & 12 completed the PRIDE leadership programme, which forms part of the Trust collective leadership portfolio. The programme, which has been revised based on user feedback and organisational requirements, includes resilience, mindfulness, handling conflict, developing effective relationships, coaching skills and performance & motivation. Action learning sets were introduced to cohorts 11 & 12 for the first time following completion of the programme. Feedback for the programme remains excellent. To further support the Trust's coaching strategy and as part of the journey to embed a coaching culture within the organisation, an initial cohort of staff completed a co aching practitioner course in 2016 and the group gained their accreditation in 2017. The cohort have supported a number of \"coachees\" alongside qualified internal coaches who continued to support senior leaders. Staff have also been able to access externa l coaching when appropriate to support them with specific development. The coaching group will be \"launched\" to the organisation in 2018. Access to leadership development programmes provided by the North West Leade rship Academy continue to be available to all staff. In 2017, the Leadership Academy announced plans to localise delivery of the Mary Seacole programme and the Trust nominated an internal facilitator to train and deliver on the revised programme. The Band 6 Collective Leadership Programme, which has a focus on developing \"clinical expert\" skills through bespoke training sessions, continues to support new and experienced ward staff. The focus has been to ensure all relevant staff receive the core clinical aspects of the Programme with the next steps being to deliver sessions which develop the leadership aspect of the role. 56 The \"next steps\" of the Ward Manager Collective Leadership Programme was launched, with Ward Managers being offered individual coaching and 360 feedback via the Leadership Acade my, as well as bespoke leadership development sessions. Training & Development supported key leads within The Rehab Network to develop a bespoke Rehabilitation module in partnership with a local university. The first cohort of attendees are currently comp leting the module. Organisational development support continues to be provided across the Trust, including team away days, team development and objective and priority setting. The Walton Centre continues to provide quality undergraduate medical student pl acements for 3rd and 5th year students, in partnership with Liverpool School of Medicine. Every 3rd year student attends the highly evaluated Neurology placement at the Trust and the innovative implementation of the formative assessment at the end of each student's placement has been acknowledged as good practice by Liverpool University and adopted by other Trusts within the region. The undergraduate programme underwent a quality monitoring visit by Liverpool University in May 2017 and the support, commitm ent, culture and pastoral care provided by The Walton Centre was highly commended by the visiting team. The recommendations provided by Health Education North West following the Quality Monitoring visit in January 2017 continue to be embedded and anecdota l feedback from trainees supports the general positive theme of the report regarding the experience of the junior doctors' whilst training at The Walton Centre . The review of the staff appraisal process continued with focus groups held to gain staff feedba ck on the current documentation and process and to understand general perception of the experience of appraisals. Staff feedback was fully taken into account to allow for the full redesign of the paperwork with the main focus becoming on how to \"Have a Co nversation\". Consultation continues regarding the revised paperwork and policy and the new documentation is due to be rolled out in 2018 once approved. Following the deep dive review of mandatory training, all changes have been implemented to ensure statutory/mandatory training requirements are supported and the Trust continues to deliver safe and effective care to its patients. The Trust has maintained good attendance for statutory and mandatory training with a revised training needs analysis agreed, su pported by a new and revised reporting framework to help support delivery of safe and effective care to our patients. The Trust continues to support all staff with a range of education and development opportunities available to support service priorities and individual development. This includes professional qualifications, conferences and seminars, post registration accredited opportunities, apprenticeships, skills development and clinical skills training - including catheterisation, cannulation and venep uncture. The apprenticeship levy was intro duced, with the Trust paying in to the levy since April 2017. The levy has been introduced for organisations to explore different ways of engaging with new staff and also providing existing staff with the educationa l framework to develop in their roles. A training needs 57 analysis has been completed to understand current organisational demand for apprenticeships within our existing workforce as we look to finalise the available offerings. As part of a commitment t o corporate and social responsibility, the Trust provides a quality work experience programme and co -ordinates the provision of elective placements, working closely with local schools and colleges. Work experience placements are highly valued and The Walt on Centre supported 47 placements in 2017/18. The Trust is working in partnership with 4 other specialist Trusts in the region and in conjunction with Merseyside Youth Association in the employment of 4 Employment Mentors, who will be supporting organisat ions specifically in developing Entry Level Vocational Learning Developments for young people as well as the following groups: people with disabilities; young carers; looked after children; assessed as not being in education, employment or training (NEETS ); veterans and their families. Schwartz Rounds continue to be part of the development available, offering staff from a range of disciplines to consider their experiences of providing care and explore any challenging emotional or social issues that they ma y deal with, as well as providing staff attending the sessions the opportunity to understand the challenges faced by our colleagues across the Trust. Feedback from the panels presenting at the sessions and from attendees has been excellent. As part of the national Talent for Care programme, focus groups were held for Bands 1 - 4 staff to invite feedback on the support and development opportunities this staff group feel is available to them. In addition to amendments to the appraisal paperwork, suggestions f or development included medical terminology, minute taking and IT skills. All development requests were considered and a programme of training has been offered, including: o Minute taking o Medical terminology o Training for emerging managers o Train the Trainer o Advanced Word o Advanced Excel o Time Management o Assertiveness Future plans include developing an internal work -experience programme. Additional support has been provided to the Care Certificate programme, including the appointment of a Care Certificate Assessor. Staff Survey The 201 7 survey was distributed between September and November 201 7. The Staff Survey is an important strand in the organisation's overall approach to staff engagement. Other elements include: 58 Established staff communications a nd engagement methods including a weekly email bulletin to all staff, Walton Weekly; plus a monthly team brief meeting for all heads of department which is led by the Chief Executive. Quarterly clinical senates draw together clinicians to discuss clinical issues and are well attended from all specialties. Regular staff and patient listening weeks. Participation in Staff Friends and Family Test Regular staff engagement events i.e. Berwick sessions and Schwartz rounds The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust had 574 staff take part in this survey with a response rate of 42% of all staff against a national average of 53% for specialist trusts in England. Table 17 below represents the Staff Feedback data from the 201 7 staff survey which i dentifies the key findings and informs future actions.

An action plan has been developed to address the issues which arose from the previous year relating to the following areas; Patient Care and Experience Appraisals and support for development Violence, harassment and bullying WRES The results of the staff survey are variable but it is important to recognise that they are mainly positive in nature. 6.2 Future Priorities and Actions The key priority areas to address inevitably need to be those identified in the bottom ranking scores. These can be explicitly profiled in existing staff engagement techniques and this will allow more prescriptive engagement exercises such as Staff Listen ing Weeks and the Chief Executive's schedule of big conversations . However, the Trust will consider the results in their entirety and identify any areas that can be improved upon. The results can also be interpreted by staff group or department which will enable the organisation to take specific action where required. The Trust's HR team visit wards/departments to gather additional feedback regarding staff survey results. This information is fed into staff communications . 61 Staff Profile On 31st March 2018 the Trust employed 1292.11 whole time equivalents made up of the following groups in table 18 below: Table 18 Staff Group WTE Headcount Prof scientific and technic 52.90 58 Clinical services 212.29 240 Administrative and clerical 339.03 374 Allied health professionals 138.82 155 Estates and ancillary 7.37 11 Healthcare scientists 20.24 22 Medical and dental 124.51 130 Nursing and midwifery registered 396.64 429 Total 1291.8 1419 Female staff = 1107 Male staff = 312 Trade Union Facility Time Relevant union officials The total number of Trust employees who were relevant union offici als during the relevant period are noted in table 19 Table 19 Number of employees who were relevant union officials during the relevant period Full-time equivalent employee number 8.00 8.00 Percentage of time spent on facility time The number of employees who were relevant union officials employed during the relevant period spent a) 0%, b) 1% -50%, c) 51% -99% or d) 100% of their working hours on facility time is noted in table 20.

In 201 7/18, the Friends and Family Test continued, facilitated via email and sent to a random s ample of staff each quarter. All Trust staff are given the opportunity to participate in the survey over the year. The Trust continues to have very positive working relationships with Staff Side, through the Staff Partnership Committee, which includes med ical representation. The Trust also has a Local Negotiation Committee for medical staff. These committees confer with staff representatives to consult and negotiate on workforce policies, procedures and terms of conditions of employment. The T rust's workf orce policies and procedures are negotiated and agreed through these forums . Staff Health and Wellbeing The established programme of health and wellbeing activities continues to be available to staff. The programme has been expanded throughout the year to include additional activities in direct response to 63 staff feedback/requests, including the introduction of a mindfulness programme and participation in a \"back class\" managed by a neighbouring Trust. In particular, there is a strong focus on ensuring activities are available for difficult to reach groups including front line ward based staff. This has inclu ded the introduction of a health and wellbeing app. The Trust's Health and Well Being programme is supported by a core group of staff including a non - executive director as Board lead and a Senior Physiotherapist as Clinical lead. A range of after work exercise classes continues to prove popular, with zumba, pilates, circuit training, yoga , netball and a successful football team consisting of staff from across the Trust and contracted staff, organised by some of the Trusts junior do ctors. Two health and wellbeing days were held during 201 7 and staff were able to take advantage of general health checks and flu vaccinations. During 201 7 the Trust was re accredited with the Investors in People Health and Wellbeing gold standard. Human Rights, Equality Diversity and Inclusion (ED&I) The Walton Centre has always recognis ed and valued the fact that its workforce is made up of individuals with a large diversity of backgrounds, perspectives and characteristics however 2017/18 has mar ked a welcome increase in the amount of effort and focus the Trust is putting into this area. During 2017/18 , there have been a number of improvements, changes and initiatives that demonstrate the higher energy levels at the Trust regarding ED&I. The Tru st has also invested in the creation of a new post of Equality and Inclusion Lead to help move the ED&I agenda forward. Equality and Diversity Objectives Trust has continued to work towards its current equality and diversity objectives, which are: Improve data collection and equality profiles for both inpatients and outpatients Improve data collection and equality profiles for all staff members Ensure all staff members are paid equally for equal work Continue to use Equality Impact Assessments to monitor policies and procedures and introduce this for all service developments and organisational change episodes Increase involvement with the local community and in local support groups for both patients and staff The Trust has recently published its ED&I 5 Ye ar Vision . This vision sets out the way forward for The Walton Centre to improve ED&I for both patients and staff. This vision has come from both staff and patients sharing what good practice looks like and how we will know when we have achieved it, s uppor ted by a detailed strategic action plan. This will be delivered by the Operational ED&I Group, who will be held to account by the ED&I Steering Group. It will be monitored through the Quality Committee with an annual revie w of the vision and action plan progress in the same 64 manner the Quality & Patient Strategy is currently monitored. This vision will guide the Trust towards making systematic improvements around ED&I in this year and in coming years. ED&I Champions The Trust has created new ED&I Champions recruited from staff to create a higher profile for ED&I and to drive positive culture change towards the Trust's equality commitments: We are committed to making ED&I a priority. We want to be a workplace that inspires leadership at all levels, with all staff, where everyone's voice is heard. We are committed to creating an inclusive culture, where staff and patients believe there is strength in difference. We want to celebrate and actively embrace diversity. We are committed to ensuring that staff and patient s have good experiences at the Trust, and feel comfortable \"bringing their whole self\" to The Walton Centre . We are committed to ensuring our care with, and for, all patients is meaningful to them, that ED&I is part of everyone's role , and is an integral part of our health and wellbeing approach. One example w here the ED&I Champions are already making a positive difference is in their work to foster a greater awareness of key cultural dates and events. One of the important actions for this in 2018 is the Trust's planned Ramadan Awareness Event. Further initiatives will be identified and implemented throughout this and coming years. On 31 March 2018 the Board of Directors comprised of: Three male and three female non -executive director s (including the Chair); Three male and two * female executive directors (and one male corporate director). *one female director is currently in an 'acting' role.

The Trust has also continued to implement its previous ED&I related training initiatives such as the mandatory three yearly Equality, Diversity and Human Rights Tr aining, ensuring that all Trust staff are maintaining awareness of equality and remain up to date with changes in legislation. Cultural Ambassadors Programme The Walton Centre is also part of a pilot programme with the RCN around Cultural Ambassadors. The Trust has recruited some of our Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) staff to receive training to be able to support colleagues through various Human Resources (HR) Processes to en sure fairness e.g. Disciplinary, Grievance and Capability processes. There is also potential to widen their programme out into supporting fairness in recruitment processes. Navajo Chartermark and Disability Confident Employer The Trust is proud to announ ce that in March 2018 the Trust successfully underwent a reaccreditation process to keep up our eligibility to use the Navajo Chartermark. This is an equality mark sponsored by InTrust Merseyside & Sefton Embrace and supported by the LGBTI Community networ ks across Merseyside. It is a signifier of good practice, commitment and knowledge of the specific needs, issues and barriers facing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in Merseyside. Navajo looks at employment practices and how service s are inclusive for LGBTI people. The Trust has also renewed its commitment to the Department for Work and Pensions, Disability Confident Employer Scheme, which commits the Trust to take positive actions to ensure that we have equitable and accessible recr uitment processes relating to disability. 68 Gender Pay Gap The Trust has met its Gender Pay Gap reporting obligations and the results are published on the Trust's website. The Trust has taken note of the results and will be making use of the data to inform action planning for the coming year The Trust Workforce Race Equality Standard (WRES) WRES April 2017. This report showed a disappointing lack of progress across most of the measures. A particular area of concern wa s the finding that the percentage of BM E staff experiencing harassment, bullying or abuse from staff in last 12 months h ad significantly increased, and the similar measure in respect of experience of discrimination remains far too high. Following analysis of the WRES, discussion at Board level and consultation , the Trust's ED&I Steering Group was set up and ED&I Champions created , the Tru st had put in place a number of actions to try and improve the experience of BME employees. Tackling bullying, harassment and discrimination will form part of t he work plan for the EDI Champions in 2018. The Trust is also looking forward to producing and publishing the Workforce Disability Equality Standar d (WDES) in 2018/19. Reciprocal Mentoring The Trust had successfully completed the first round of the Recipr ocal Mentoring programme. The Reciprocal Mentoring scheme had been established in conjunction with two other local Tru sts. The aim of the programme was to support employee s from minority grou ps to further their development, whilst also improving the sen ior leaders understanding of what it means to be a BME employee within the Trust. Planning for the 2018 round of Reciprocal Mentoring had commenced . Equality Delivery System The Trust's Equality Delivery System (EDS 2) review is currently being undertaken for 2018 in conjunction with Healthwatch and local community groups. The Trust is not seeking to increase its grades on any of the sub-goals in 2018 , as the emphasis for this year's EDS is the work that the Trust is doing with othe r Merseyside t rusts to focus on improving areas which are identified as real barriers by organisations who represent the views of people within each protected characteristic. This approach will enab le real progress to be made in areas that make a real difference, whilst continuing to support the Trust with its duties under the Public Sector Equality Duty. Equality Impact Analysis The improved Equality Impact Assessments/Analysis (EIA) is being devel oped further , following user feedback , to increase the level of guidance and support for staff completing the EIA. The electronic form is currently being used for the CIP process which contains both a quality impact assessment and an equality impact assess ment. This means that the responsible manager must complete both sections before any CIP can be fully considered. These steps will help the Trust to ensure that it pays due rega rd to its obligations under the Public Sector Equality Duty of the Equality Ac t 2010. 69 Engagement Finally, relationships have continued to be built with all local Healthwatch groups, with equality becoming a standing item on the Patient Experience Group agenda. Involvement with other local networks and charities has included regul ar engagement with the Brain Charity, epilepsy patients and Navajo. Learning Disability Group The Trust has a Learning Disability Steering Group that feeds into the Trust's Safeguarding Group which in turn reports to the Board of Directors via the Patient Safety Group. The Learning Disability Steering Group meets quarterly and has developed good l inks with the community learning disability teams in the local areas. Members of the Trust's Learning Disability Steering Group also attend the Trust's Safeguarding Group meetings . The chair of the Learning Disability Steering Group is the Matron for Safeg uarding who is also a member of the Liverpool and Sefton Acute Trusts Liaison Learning Disability Group. Community and Social Responsibilities The Walton Centre is committed to working in partnership with our local communities, supporting people to develop appropriate skills and experience required to enter the employment market. We support a number of projects which we believe assist our local population including; taking a proactive approach to providing meaningful work experience in the workplace acr oss a range of departments - in 2017/18 the Trust supported 57 work experience students . The Trust has continued to support internships during the schoo l summer holidays and has participated in the career ready mentoring programme with a local school. The Trust also participates in career fairs, career talks to local schools and colleges and organises health and wellbeing activities. The Trust is currently working in partnership with the Merseyside Health Sector Career & Engagement Hub to develop internal H ealth Career Ambassadors to encourage young people to choose a career in the NHS from a range of disciplines. The Trust is also part of a collaborative approach in North Merseyside for apprenticeships, to offer a range of opportunities linked to this impor tant agenda. In collaboration with other specialist Trusts and alongside Merseyside Youth Association, a group of NHS Employment Mentors commenced in post in January 2018. Their roles will focus on working with local communities, education providers, emplo yment agencies and the Trust to further develop access to work experience, qualifications and career routes in to the NHS. Reputation and Fundraising Communications work continued to support the Trust's strategy and promote the Trust's vision of Excellence in Neuroscience through the proactive use of print and broadcast media, t he Trust's magazine and website and the Trust's social media accounts. The Communications team also worked to promote the Trust's Vanguard programme, The Ne uro Network, to staff, patients and other stakeholders. 70 This year the Trust appeared frequently in print and other media. A highlight was coverage of the iMRI scanner and new theatres development launch event attended by Marina and Kenny Dalglish which attracted local new s coverage in papers and ITV News, including video footage shot inside the hospital's new theatres. Another highlight was the coverage of the Organ Donation Week celebrations by Made in Liverpool television. The team produced four editions of the members' magazine Neuromatters which is sent to over 5,000 members as well as being available on site for staff and visitors. The Trust's social media accounts continued to grow, and provide a valuable engagement tool for members of the public and staff. This year the team added a new Instagram account alongside the established Facebook and Twitter accounts to reach an expanded audience. During the period April 2017 -March 2018, the Trust's Facebook page grew by 1,350 likes (a 35% increase), the Twitter account by 1 ,135 followers (a 16% increase), and the Instagram account by 450 followers. The most successful posts during the year included news about the visit by LFC goalkeeper Simon Mignolet to the MS service (post seen 85,000 times on Twitter), and a Trust overvie w video about our values and services (post seen by 46,000 individuals on Facebook). Around 150 members of staff attended the annual Staff Awards event, which recognised the achievements of staff who had been nominated by patients and their colleagues, as well as the Trust as a whole. For the Trust's reaccreditation with Investors In People Gold Standard the team produced a new poster campaign, social media content, banners, and media releases. The team also supported the annual 'Walton Willow' memorial ce lebration during Organ Donation Week which was attended by hundreds of patient relatives and staff. The team also supported the Trust's annual flu vaccination campaign which successfully met the national target for workforce vaccinations. The team supporte d recruitment events at the Trust with social media content including videos and staff interviews, banners, and other media releases, and a variety of internal events, engagement sessions, staff-focused campaigns, and health and wellbeing opportunities. During the year under review t he Charity has continued to go from strength to strength; communit y support grew steadily, with further increase in the number of supporters using on -line fundraising platforms such as Justgiving and Virgin Money Giving to facil itate their sponsored events and maximise gift -aid opportunities. Events included sponsored r uns, cycle rides, sky dives and extreme challenges such as 'Tough Mudder' and bungee jumping . The Charity has also been chosen as Charity of the Year for 2018 by two corporate organisations, as voted for by their staff - this will help greatly in not only raising funds but also awareness. In addition to raising awareness and unrestricted funds, the Charity also continued to raise funds for specific purposes such as the Home from Home Fund and the Sid Watkins Innovation Fund. Donations to the Home from Home Fund ensure that the Trust can continue to provide the facility free of charge to 71 relatives whose loved ones are receiving cr itical care at the hospital; and The Sid Watkins Innovation Fund support s innovation and research in the fi eld of neurological health care. A number of events were organised by the Charity during this time including the Golf Day and the Jan Fairclough B all, which caters to our corporate supporters. More community focussed events such as the abseil and the annual Hope Mountain Hike were both once more heavily supported by staff as well as patients and their families. In addition to the events organised b y the Charity team, there was a high profile event organised by the Bentley Drivers Club in aid of the Sid Watkins Fund. The event took place at Aintree Racecourse with a gala dinner at Knowsley Hall. The Charity has also been involved in developing a pro cess through which ideas/requests can be identified and considered as potential future fundraising projects. The process links in with the Trust's newly established Medical Innovation Group, which was established to help create an organisational culture where all members of staff are encouraged to think creatively to enable practical innovations to improve patient care. Some of the ideas will become projects and/or programmes that will be supported by the Charity. Specific focus during the year under revi ew has been on complex rehabilitation.

Audit Committee The Audit Committee is a committee of the Non -Executive Directors (excluding the Chairman) and is chaired by Alan Sharples. The Committee met on five occasions during 2017/18. Meetings of the Trust's Audit Committee and attendance h ave been represented in table 36 as follows during th e reporting period 01 April 2017 to 31 March 2018 : Table 36 April 20 17 May 20 17 July 20 17 Oct 20 17 Jan 20 18 Alan Sharples Ann McCracken Seth Crofts 85 The Role of the Audit Committee: The Audit Committee critically reviews the governance and assurance processes upon which the Board of Directors places reliance. Three Non-Executive Directors are members of the Audit Committee, reflecting the importance that the Board places on the Audit Committee to enable effective Non Executive challenge, including triangulation of the work of the Board's Assurance Committees ( Busine ss Performance Committee and Quality Committee ) across all aspects of the Trust's business. Principal Review Areas in 2017/18 The narrative below sets out the principal areas of review and significant issues considered by the Audit Committee during 2017/18 reflecting the key objectives of the committee as set out in its terms of reference. Internal Control and Risk Management The Committee has reviewed relevan t disclosure statements for 2017/18 and other appropriate independent assurance together with the Head of Internal Audit Opinion, external audit opi nion and considers that the 2017/18 Annual Governance Statement is consistent with the Committee's view on the Trust's system of internal control. Review s undertaken in 2017/18 included: Review Title Assurance Level ESR (HR / Payroll Interface) High Combined Financial Systems High / Significant CIP/QIA Significant IG Toolkit Activity Data (Cyclical Review) - cancer targets Significant Significant Volunteers Significant NICE - Use of Antimicrobials Serious Untoward Incidents Significant Significant Patch / Vulnerability Management Limited Assurance Framework Opinion Audit Committee Effectiveness Met N/A - Effectiveness report issued Business Performance Committee Effectiveness N/A - Effectiveness session facilitated and report issued Well-Led Assessment N/A - Outcome report issued 86 Where limited assurance was received , the committee deliberated the report with follow u p audits/review of action plans and invited the relevant management lead to atten d the next Committee meeting to provide a progress update on recommendations. Governance, Risk Management and Internal Control The wor k of the Audit Committee in 2017/18 has been to review the effectiveness of the organisation and its systems of governance, risk management and internal control through a programme of work involving the scrutiny of assurances provided by internal audit, exte rnal audit, local anti -fraud officer, Trust managers, finance staff and the clinical audit team along with reports and reviews from other external bodies. An annual work programme is set at the start of the year along with agreement of the internal audit and anti-fraud work plans, with provision to meet contingency requirements. Review of the Work of the Auditors The Audit Committee undertook a review of the work of both internal and external auditors during the year, with the Audit Committee receiving a report at its July 2017 meeting, which was approved by the Committee. The Committee reviews the establishment and maintenance of an effective system of integrated governance, risk management and internal control across the whole of the Trust's activiti es, both clinical and non -clinical, that supports the achievement of the Trust's objectives. In addition, the Committee monitors the integrity of the financial statements of the Trust, and any formal announcements relating to the Trust's financial perform ance, reviewing significant financial reports and the judgments contained in them. In particular, the Committee reviews the adequacy of: All risk and control related disclosure statements, in particular the Annual Governance Statement and declarations of compliance with the CQC outcomes, together with any accompanying Director of Internal Audit statement, external audit opinion or other appropriate independent assurances, prior to endorsement by the Board of Directors. Underlying assurance processes that i ndicate the degree of the achievement of corporate objectives, the effectiveness of the management of principal risks and the appropriateness of the above disclosure statements. Policies for ensuring compliance with relevant regulatory, legal and code of c onduct requirements. Policies and procedures for all work related to fraud and corruption. 87 In carrying out this work, the Committee primarily utilises the work of internal audit, external audit and other assurance functions and also makes requests of, and receives reports and assurances from, directors and managers as appropriate and by using an effective assurance framework / Trust -wide risk register to guide its work and that of the audit and assurance functions that report to it. Internal Audit Throughout the year, the Committee has worked effectively with MIAA, the Trust's appointed internal audit ors, to ensure that the design and operation of the Trust's internal control processes are sufficiently robust. The Committee has given considerable a ttention to the importance of follow up in respect of internal audit work in order to gain assurance that appropriate management action has been implemented. The latest follow up report received by the Committee in January 2018 , noted that a number of recommendations still needed to be implemented. Given the delays in implementation of the actions, the Committee tasked management to escalate to relevant leads in order to bring an updated position to a forthcoming Audit Committee in accordance with the Commi ttee work plan. The Committee has considered the major findings of internal audit and where appropriate has sought management assurance that remedial action has been taken. 'Limited assurance' was assigned to the Patch / Vulnerability Management review in 2017/18 . On this occasion, the Committee requested sight of the full report including management response and attendance at the meeting by the relevant lead. This has continued to strengthen the Committee's response to major audit findings in 2016/17 a nd has ensured that any control weaknesses are understood by the Audit committee and are quickly addressed. The Committee reviewed and approved the internal audit plan and detailed programm e of work for 2017/18 at its April 2017 meeting. This included a r ange of key risks identified through discussion with Management and Executives and review of the Trust's Board Assurance Framework. Reviews were identified across a range of areas, including combined financial systems, IM&T, Performance, Clinical Quality, Workforce, Governance and Risk. Mersey Internal Audit Agency (MIAA) has supported the non -executive directors over the year through the provision of networking events, policy advice, and Insight updates. MIAA routinely reviews the papers received by the Board of Directors and minutes of Board meetings to pick up on areas of potential risk for inclusion in the audit programme. 88 Anti- Fraud The Committee reviewed and approved t he anti -fraud work plan for 2017/18 at its April 2017 meeting noting coverage across all mandated areas of strategic governance, inform and involve, prevent and deter and hold to account. During the course of the year the Committee regularly reviewed updates on proactive anti-fraud work . External Audit The Committee routinely received progress reports from the external auditor, including an update on the annual accounts audit timetable and programme of work, updates on key emerging national issues and developments which may be of interest to Committee members alongside a number of challenge questions in respect of these emerging issues which the Committee provided a management response to at every quarterly meeting. The value of external audit services for the year was \u00a347,000 (including VAT). In addition to this , \u00a38k was incurred for other auditor remuneration; \u00a36,000 for the Quality Account and \u00a3900 for the review of the Technology Stra tegy Board Grant, plus VAT . During 2017/18 , the auditor has not been engaged in any non -audit activity. The Trust's external auditors, Grant Thornton UK LLP , were appointed by the Council of Governors in April 2017 follo wing a formal procurement exercise for a contract period of three accounting years, with an option to extend for a further accounting year. The audit committee included a number of significant accounting issues and treatments in its consideration of the T rust's financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2018. During the year the committee critically addressed the issues around the appropriateness of the Accounting Policies that have been adopted and was satisfied that the policies were reasonable and appropriate. As part of the full year reporting process the external auditors, Grant Thornton, consider the key areas of accounting judgement and disclosure. For each of these areas, the audit committee critically review and assess the policies and judgem ents that have been applied, the consistency of policy application from year to year and the appropriateness of the relevant disclosures made, together with the compliance with applicable accounting standards. The key areas of accounting judgement and disc losure are shown in the Trusts final accounts. The committee has been able to place reliance upon work und ertaken by the External auditors as part of the work that the y undertook to enable them to develop their Audit Opinion. The following additional sign ificant issues have been discussed by the Audit Committee during 2017/18: the accuracy of income recorded in relation to patient care activities, in particular income related to additional NHS contract activity; 89 the risk of management over -ride of controls (which includes an understanding of accounting judgements applied); Valuation of property, plan t and equipment. Other Assurance Functions The Committee has routinely received reports on Losses and Special Payments , Bad Debts and Tender Waivers. The Committee has reviewed and agreed the updated Standing Financial Instruction s and Scheme of Reservation and Delegation for Board approval. Members of the Committee have met privately with the internal and external auditors, without the presence of any Trust officer. Financial Reporting The Committee has reviewed the accounting policies and annual financial statements prior to submission to the Board and considered these to be accurate. It has ensured that all external audit recommendations have been addressed. Review of Audit Committee Effectiveness Last year, the Audit Committee undertook its annual self -assessment , including a review of its Terms of Reference, via a facilitated workshop session by MIAA on the 19th May 2017 and subsequently produ ced a report and action plan. Of the actions identified , MIAA was subsequently satisfied that these had been addressed. 2. Walton Centre Charity Committee (WCCC) The role of the WCCC is to ensure the charity is managed and administered in accordance with the require ments of the Charity Commission and that the charity produces audited Annual Accounts.

Governors' Nominations Committee There is also a Governors' Nominations Committee which is responsible for considering nominations and remuneration for non -executive directors. Current members of the Committee are: Janet Rosser, Trust Chair Louise Ferguson, Nominations Committee Chair and Public Constituency Governor Colin Cheesman, Public Constituency Governor Ella Pereira, Stakeholder Go vernor The Governors' Nominations Committee had no reason to convene during the reporting period. Health and Safety Performance, Occupational Health and Staff Sickness Absence Health and Safety The total number of RIDDOR (Reporting of Injuries Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations) reportable accidents sent to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) d uring the financial year of 2017/18 was 16 compared to 10 in 2016/17 . Occupatio nal Health/Health and Wellbeing The Trust continues to support a pr ogramme of health and wellbeing initiatives for staff and is continually looking to develop and expand these. A small multi -disciplinary health and wellbeing group has continued McCracken S Crofts A P Humphrey A A A S Samuels A 92 Two staff health and wellbeing days take place each year and the Tr ust regularly takes on board staff feedback and reviews its offers to staff. A back care programme introduced in 2016 to support staff with MSK conditions has continued to expand and develop over the past year . The Trust's Health and Wellbeing Occupational Health Service continues to be provided by a service level agreement with Aintree University Hospital with key performance indicators monitored via quarterly review meetings. This year, the Trust has had a very successful flu campaign, which was a collaboration between the Trust and Occupational Health Service. Following a tendering process t he Trust's onsite counselling service is provided by the Network of Staff Supporters ( NOSS ). Staff can access the service themselves or via their manager.

Policies and Procedures with Respect to Countering Fraud and Corruption The Trust has an Anti -Fraud, Bribery and Corruption policy in place and does not tolerate fraud, bribery and corruption. The aim is to eliminate all NHS fraud, bribery and corruption as far as possible. The Trust is committed to taking all necessary steps to counter fraud, bribery and corruption. To meet its objectives, it has adopted the four -stage approach developed by the NHS Protect: 93 1. Strategic Governance This section sets out the standard in relation to the organisation's strategic governance arrangements. The aim is to ensure that anti -crime measures are embedded at all levels across the organisation. 2. Inform and Involve This section sets out the requi rement in relation to raising awareness of crime risks against the NHS and working with NHS staff, stakeholders and the public to highlight the risks and consequences of crime against the NHS. 3. Prevent and Deter This section sets out the requirements in relation to discouraging individuals who may be tempted to commit crimes against the NHS and ensure that opportunities for crime are minimised. 4. Hold to Account This section sets out the requirement in relation to detecting crime and investigating crime . Prosecuting those who have committed crime and seeking redress. During the financial year 2017/18 the Trust's Anti -Fraud Specialist (AFS ) completed a wide range of work across the main key areas of activity as outlined by the NHS Counter Fraud Authori ty (NHS CFA) and agreed within the work plan approved by the Audit Committee. The plan was substantially delivered, with one piece of work carried over to 2018/19 in respect of conflict of interests. The Trust has a Standards of Business and Personal Con duct Policy . During 2017/18 the Trust has implemented a new Managing Conflicts Policy in line with national guidance , which has superseded the Hospitality, Gifts and Sponsorship Policy. An anti -fraud work plan is agreed with the Director of Finance and approved by the Audit Committee and the anti-fraud specialist is a regular attendee at Audit Committee meetings to provide an update on the on - going programme of proactive work to prevent any potential fraud and investigatory work into reported and suspec ted incidents of fraud. Compliance with the Cost Allocation and Charging Requirements set out in HM Treasury and Office of Public Sector Information Guidance The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust has complied with the cost allocation and charging requirements set out in HM Treasury and Office of Public Sector Information Guidance. The Trust complies with the Approved Costing Guidance issued by NHS Improvement in February 2016. The Trust's Finance Department works with all departments within the Trust to use the activity information available within the Trust and an established NHS costing package to appropriately allocate expenditure to services and patients. T he Trust was a pilot site for the national costing transformation programme that is being 94 introduced by NHS Improvement and work began on th is in January 2017. The Trust was also an early implementer of a Costing Transformation Programme introduced by NHS Improvement in 20 16/17. Contracts The Trust has many contracts for goods and services with numerous suppliers in the private and public sectors. Whilst all are important the following are regarded as essential to the daily operation of the business and would be difficult to change at short notice: The close proximity of Aintree University Hospital means that the Trust can benefit from economies of scale by using their infrastructure to provide some of its support services. There is a service level agreement in place to cover these services which include Pharmacy Services as well as many estates functions including the provision of utilities and emergency maintenance. The EBME service has undergone a full tender exercise recently and the contract has been awarded to Royal Liverpool and Broa dgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust until March 2021 (the contract was previously held with Aintree University Hospital until March 2018 ). St Helens & Knowsley NHS Trust provide the Trust with Payroll services; this is covered under contract until Septem ber 2018. The Trust's Patient Information System is provided by Silver Link and is under contract until April 2019. The Radiology Picture Archive and Communication System (PACS) and information system has been awarded as part of a consortium of local NH S bodies . The information element has been awarded to HSS (until June 2020) and the PACS element to Care Stream (until June 2023). ISS Mediclean provides hotel services including cleaning, portering, security and patient meals. This service underwent a ful l tender exercise in 2016 and a four year contract was awarded until March 2020. Laundry services for the Trust are provided by ISS Mediclean and are unde r contract until September 2018, with an option to extend for a further 12 months. Decontamination ser vices are provided by Steris and are under contract until 2023, with a potential break clause in the contract in 2019. Neuropathology and mortuary services are provided by Liverpool Clinical Laboratories (LCL), with a contract in place until July 2018. Policies applied to contracts for goods and services: Procurement and Tendering Policy, Sustainability Policy and Supplier Representative Policy. 95 Policies applied to contracts for goods and services: Give full and fair consideration to applications for emplo yment made by disabled persons, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. Facilitate the continuing employment of, and arranging training for, employees who became disabled during the period. Facilitate the training, career development and promotion of disabled employees. Any applicant who wishes to declare their disability on their application form will be given a guaranteed interview by the Trust providing they meet the minimum criteria for the vacancy. All candidates are asked in their i nvite to interview if they require any reasonable adjustments to be made for their interview and these are always accommodated wherever possible. Once appointed, and throughout an employee's employment, where necessary the Trust's Occupational Health Depar tment will be consulted to advise on any reasonable adjustments which need to be made. Although NHS Jobs 2 is a web -based system application forms are also available in other formats upon request. To ensure improved monitoring, the HR Department have an es tablished central log to record where staff have been supported with reasonable adjustments. 96 3v Accountability Report - regulatory ratings 2017/18 : NHS Improvement Performance and CQC Ratings NHS Improvement award Foundation trusts regulatory ratings based on self -certification received from trusts in their annual plan, in -year monthly submissions and any exception reports, including any reports from third parties such as the Care Quality Commi ssion (CQC). The ratings for The Walton Centre Foundation Trust over the last two years are summarised in the tables below. Ratings awarded at the start of the year are based on the expected performance at the time of the annual risk assessment in our annual plan. The quarterly ratings are based on ac tual performance reported to NHS Improvement, via quarterly in-year submissions. NHS Improvement moved to the Single Oversight Framework in October 2016. Single Oversight Framework NHS Improvement's Single Oversight Framework provides the framework for o verseeing providers and identifying potential support needs. The framework looks at five themes: Quality of care Finance and use of resources Operational performance Strategic change Leadership and improvement capability (well -led). Based on information fr om these themes, providers are placed in a segmentation rating from 1 to 4, where '4' reflects providers receiving the most support, and '1' reflects providers with maximum autonomy. A foundation trust will be in segments 3 or 4 where it has been found to be in breach or suspected breach of its licence. The Single Oversight Framework applied from Quarter 3 of 2016/17. Prior to this, Monitor's Risk Assessment Framework (RAF) was in place. Information for the prior year and first two quarters of 2016/17 relating to the RAF has not been presented as the basis of accountability was different. This is in line with NHS Improvement's guidance for annual reports. Segmentation This s egmentation information is the T rust's position as at 31st March 2018. Current segmentation information for NHS trusts and foundation trusts is published on the NHS Improvement website. Following a review of the Trust 's financial position The Walt on Centre Foundation Trust was placed in segment 1 . This is the lowest level of oversight with no potential support needs having been identified resulting in maximum autonomy within the Single Oversight Framework. 97 Finance and use of resources The finance and use of resources theme is based on the scoring of five measures from '1' to '4', where '1' reflects the strongest performance. These scores are then weighted to provide an overall score. Given that finance and use of resources is only one o f the five themes feeding into the Single Oversight Framework, the segmentation of the trust disclosed above might not be the same as the overall finance score shown in the table below. Table 39 Governance Rating NHS Improvement use a combination of methods to assess governance issues at NHS foundation trusts and to gain assurance of their standards of governance. Trusts are rated green where there are no concerns, red where they are under formal regulatory investigation or 'under re view' where concerns have been identified by the trust or its regulators which require further investigation.

The relevant responsibilities of the accounting officer, including their responsibility for the propriety and regularity of public finances for which they are answerable, and for the keeping of proper accounts, are set out in the NHS Foundation T rust Accounting Officer Memorandum issued by NHS Improvement. NHS Improvement, in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor by the NHS Act 2006, has given Accounts Directions which require The Walton Centre NHS foundation trust to prepare for each financial year a statement of accounts in the form and on the basis required by those Directions. The accounts are prepared on an accruals basis and must give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of The Wal ton Centre NHS foundation trust and of its income and expenditure, total recognised gains and losses and cash flows for the financial year. In preparing the accounts, the Accounting Officer is required to comply with the requirements of the Department of Health Group Accounting Manual and in particular to: observe the Accounts Direction issued by NHS Improvement, including the relevant accounting and disclosure requirements, and apply suitable accounting policies on a consistent basis make judgements an d estimates on a reasonable basis state whether applicable accounting standards as set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual (and the Department of Health Group Accounting Manual ) have been followed, and disclose and explain any material departures in the financial statements ensure that the use of public funds complies with the relevant legislation, delegated authorities and guidance and prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis. The accounting officer is responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the NHS foundation trust and to enable him/her to ensure that the accounts comply with requirements outlined in the above mentioned Act. The Accounting Officer is also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the NHS foundation trust and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. To the best of my knowledge and belief, I have prope rly discharged the responsibilities set out in the NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum . 100 Signed Chief Executive Date: 25 May 2018 101 3vii Accountability Report - annual governance statement Scope of Responsibility As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for maintaining a sound system of internal control that supports the achievement of the NHS Foundation Trust' s policies, aims and objectives; whilst safeguarding the public funds and dep artmental assets for wh ich I am personally responsible and in accordance with the responsibilities assigned to me. I am also responsible for ensuring that The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust is administered prudently and economically and that resources are applied efficiently and effectively. I also acknowledge my responsibilities as set out in NHS Foundation Trust Accounting Officer Memorandum. The Trust is required to r egister with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Its current registration status is 'Registered without Conditions'. Within the year 2017/2018 there have been no CQC inspections. The quarterly engagement meetings between the CQC and the Trust have continued to be held throughout the year. These have been attended by the CQC Engagement Manager, the Director of Nursing and the Deputy Director o f Governance and where there had been a specific topic for discuss ion the relevant specialist was invited. The CQC has held t wo focus groups during the year which ha ve included all levels of staff within the area. Within the year Hayley Citrine was appointed as the new Chief Executive Officer and the Deputy Director of Nursing was appointed as the \"A cting Director of Nursing\". The purpose of the system of internal control The system of internal control is designed to manage risk to a reasonable level rather than to eliminate all risk of failure; it can therefore only provide reasonable and not absol ute assurance of effectiveness. The system of internal control is based on an on -going process designed to identify and prioritise the risks to the achievement of the Trust strategies, policies, aims and objectives of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust , to evaluate the likelihood of thos e risks being realised and the impact should they be realised, and to manage them efficiently, effectively and economically . The system of internal control has been in place in The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust for the year ended 31 March 2018 and up to the date of approval of the annual report and accounts. There have been no significant control issues identified. Capacity to handle risk The Board of Directors collectively takes a proactive role in providing leader ship to the organisational risk management process. The Trust has a Risk Management Strategy which was approved by the Quality Committee in October 2016. The Risk Management Strategy identifies the objectives in table 42 : 102 Table 42 Objective No Objective Description Objective No 1 Define the organisations risk appetite Objective No 2 Ensure a single and comprehensive risk management process Objective No 3 Increase the coverage and utilisation of appropriate risk assessments throughout the Trust Objective No 4 Increase the use of Trust wide data to inform the risk management process Objective No 5 Enhance the knowledge and skills base of staff in risk management across the Trust, thereby also further encouraging an open and transparent reporting culture Objective No 6 Strengthen the system of assurance regarding risk through to Board level Compliance with the objectives of the strategy is monitored by the Quality Committee and was last presented in October 2017 . The Trust also has a Risk Manage ment Policy which sets out the roles and responsibilities of the chief executive, executive directors, executive director with responsibility for risk, and the managerial roles key to the co -ordination of risk management throughout the organisation. The p olicy clearly states that all Trust employees have a responsibility for the management of risk; it also describes the systems of governance process for the management of risk. The following committees of the Board of Directors have delegated powers for the responsibility of monitoring high -level risks within their terms of reference: Quality Committee Business Perform ance Committee Audit Committee The Quality Committee is chaired by a Non -Executive Director and in order to ensure appropriate challenge, part of its constit ution includes attendance by two other Non -Executive Director s. The terms of reference of the committee require it to act as a scrutiny committee, providing assurance to the Trust Board that adequate and appropriate checks and balances a re in place, and that controls which arise from risk assessment and mitigation processes are robust. The Quality C ommittee is also responsible for the review of the Trust Risk Register which is formed by those risks which are held on the operational risk r egisters and are rated as 12 and above. Also included in the Quality Committee Terms of Reference is the quarterly review of those risks on the Board Assurance Framework for which i t has designated responsibility . The Business Performance Committee is chaired by a Non -Executive Director; and in order to ensure appropriate challenge, part of its constit ution includes attendance by two other Non -Executive Director s. 103 The committee's responsibilities relating to risk ma nagement require the scrutiny of those risks on the Board Assurance Framework for which it has designated responsibility. The committee provides assurance to the Trust Board that the systems and processes are robust and, if required, has the capacity to es calate issues to the Trust Board. During the year 2017/18, the Business Performance Committee has requested detailed reports on specific risks included on the Board Assurance Framework; this has enabled the committee to provide assurance to the Trust Board that those adequate checks and balances were in place. The Audit Committee is chaired by a Non -Executive Director, and its membership is constituted of two other independent Non -Executive Director members. Governors of the Trust are invited to observe th e committee and are required to act as a link between the Audit Committee and the Council of Governors, thus ensuring transparency and promoting engagement. The Audit Committee has oversight of the system of risk management and assurance, including the Bo ard Assurance Framework. It has a cycle of business that requires attendance by members of the senior management team to provide assurance in relation to the effective design and operation of systems of control that fall within their respective portfolios . The Patient Safety Group reports into the Quality Committee. The Terms of Reference of the Patient Safety Group reflect the scrutiny and oversight function of the operational elements of risk and governance throughout the organisation. Divisional risk registers are presented to, and scrutinised by, the group on a rotational basis; at meetings where divisions are not scheduled to fully review their registers, an exception report informs the group of new risks and those which have been archived . This pr ocess ensures cross divisional challenge and a Trust -wide consistency in the grading of risks, which in turn, provides a standardised organisational risk profile. The Patient Safety Group is also responsible for the scrutiny of serious untoward incidents, root cause analyses, safety alerts and related action plans. Monthly multidisciplinary divisional governance and risk meetings are held in each of the divisions, all o f which have core agenda items which include the review of risk register s, complaints, incidents and health and safety issues. The Chair 's reports from these groups report into the Quality Committee. A Harm Free Care Board which is comprised of lead nurses and members of the governance department meet each week to continually review risk re gisters, monitor progress of root cause analysis investigations and complaints. The Trust holds quarterly Council of Governors Steering Group meetings which act as a forum for discussion and engagement with the governors. The steering group also agrees the agenda for the quarterly Council of Governors meetings . The Council of Governors meetings e nable governor consultation and provides an oversight and scrutiny function. Development of the Council of Governors is referenced in section 3iv. 104 2017 saw the impl ementation of a Trust -wide safety huddle for all staff groups to raise and discuss safety concerns affecting patients, visitor and staff. Meeting are held each weekday morning for approximately 20 minutes to support excellent communication and champion sa fety. The Board Assurance Framework is reviewed and monitored each quarter by the Executive Team, the board committees and the Trust Board. This scrutiny allows the Board of Directors to satisfy itself that risks which threaten the achievement of strategic objectives are under prudent control and fall within the Board's risk appetite. The Audit Committee reviews the framework each quarter ensuring that the correct governance process has been followed. The Quality Committee and the Busi ness Performance Commi ttee review the specific risks for which they have delegated responsibility. To ensure that the Trust's approach to managing risk is successfully implemented and maintained, staff at all levels are provided with appropriate risk management and incident re port training which is appropriate to their role and responsibility within the organisation. Training includes, but is not limited to: incident reporting, health and safety, risk management, fire safety, infection control and prevention, information gove rnance, root cause analysis, complaints management, equality and diversity, safeguarding children and vulnerable adults, conflict resolution and basic life support. Other risk management training is provided on a formal and ad hoc basis as part of the cor porate learning and development programme. A training needs analysis has been developed which is managed by the training and development function and is monitored through the performance management process . This identifies the initial and on -going mandat ory training requirements for all employees. All new starters attend a mandatory induction programme which covers all areas of risk management. The Trust is an accredited centre for the Institution of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH) Managing Safely course for senior staff. This is an internationally recognised certificate of competence. Training in the use of Datix is provided to all staff. There is also an accessible, specialist system lead based centrally with the Risk Management Team. All staff can access the Datix system to report an incident online. Line manager s quality che ck the data before the information is validated and referred to the appropriate person in the organisation. Escalation is based on the risk rating score of the issue repor ted. The Trust continually strives to improve its risk management performance by capturing good practice and lessons learned from a wealth of sources including complaints, litigation, incidents, audits and reviews. To facilitate the learning of lessons f rom incidents, the Trust uses the following processes: a regular Lessons Learned newsletter, inclusion in monthly assurance reports to the specific wards and departments, inclusion in the quarterly governance and risk report and inclusion in the monthly Te am Brief and weekly email bulletin to staff, Walton Weekly. The Trust has developed a root cause a nalysis action and assurance tracker. This records proposed actions from investigations and holds the evidence to demonstrate that any recommended action has been 105 taken. The tracker is reviewed each week at the Harm Free Care Board and the monthly divisional governance and risk meetings. The Trust fully acknowledges its duty of candour which supports one of its core values of openness. Incidents which fall int o the requirements of the regulations are identified through the daily scrutiny of the Datix system. Relevant incidents are identified and entered onto a tracker which manages Trust compliance to the Duty of Candour regulations. All patients, and in some c ircumstances relatives, who fall into the duty of candour requirements are offered an apology by the relevant clinician as soon as possible and this is recorded in the patient records. The patient or relative will then receive a letter offering an apology which is signed by the Chief Executive. The letter of apology also includes an offer for the relative/family/carer to contribute to the subsequent investigation and enquires whether the recipient would like to receive a copy of the final root cause analys is investigation. The Trust has robust policy development and management processes in place which ensures that documents which support patient care are fit for purpose and are approved and ratified by a nominated group/committee. Strategies and policie s relating to risk management are kept under review throughout the year. All risk and control related policies have an equality impact assessment completed as required by the Trust's document control arrangements. Any proposed cost improvement plans unde rgo a quality impact assessment to ensure that any changes in funding to services or schemes do not increase risk unexpectedly or negatively impact on patient safety, patient experience or clinical effectiveness of the service. The Trust's Risk Management team is a component of a wider governance department which integrates all components of risk for effective control and greater efficiencies. The Risk and Control Framework: Risk Management Risks are identified, assessed and recorded by senior managers w ho input information from risk assessments onto Datix, an electronic web based risk management solution. Formal risk management reports and registers are managed at divisional governance meetings and reviewed with local departmental managers. The Board of Directors recognises the value of taking a strategic, proactive and comprehensive approach to the assessment and the control of risk. The Trust appreciates the variety of significant benefits which can be achieved from improving patient care and the sa fety of the working environment for its staff, which assist in reducing levels of financial risk and loss for the organisation as a whole. The Board of Directors consider the nature and extent of the risks facing the organisation, the amount and type of r isk identified, the likelihood that the risk might materialise and the ability to control the impact of the risk . At the beginning of each year, the Board scores the risk of failure to achieve its strategic objectives and identifies a target score for tha t risk. The target score may be at the same level (where the Board has an appetite for that risk) or lower (where the risk score is intolerable and must be mitigated to a lower level). 106 The Board's appetite toward compliance with statutory legislation is to refrain from risks which may prevent compliance. On this basis the risk appetite aligned to the strategic priorities should not be taken into consideration for compliance related decisions. The Board has set a risk appetite of Cautious / Moderate. This reflects the environment that the organisation is currently operating in and the need to be innovative when considering options for improvement. This does not indicate that the Board is seeking to undertake 'risky behaviour' . To ensure consistency in p rocess, all risk assessments are completed using the ISO 3100 Risk Management Standard and evaluated using a 5x5 risk grading matrix which is described in the Trust Risk Management Policy. All risk assessments, including information on evaluation and cont rol, are recorded on Datix and supported by action plans which are rigorously monitored at the weekly Harm Free Care Group, monthly Divisional Governance Groups, and the Patient Safety Group. Lessons learned from risk assessments and serious untoward incidents are shared via the monthly ward and department assurance reports, the monthly divisional governa nce reports, the quarterly Governance and Risk Report, the Incident Feedback , Team Brief, Trust Safety Huddle, Walton Weekly and through email bulletins to all staff. The Trust's Stra tegic Objectives for 2017/18 were : 1. Improving quality by focusing on patient experience and clinical effectiveness 2. Sustaining and developing our services 3. Research and innovation for patient care 4. Developing our hospital 5. Recruiting, retaining and developing our workforce 6. Maintaining our financial health In resp onse to feedback from the executive team, the Board Assurance Framework has been subject to a complete review during the y ear 2017/2018 . As at 31 March 2018, the Board Assurance Framework identified eight risks to the strategic objectives. All risks have r obust controls and treatment plans to mitigate the risk as far as reasonably practicable. Therefore, the level of risk will decrease once risk treatment is effective. Compliance to the UK Corporate Governance Code is explained in section 3iv of this docum ent, compliance with th e single oversight framework found in section 3v. Development of the Council of Governors is referenced in section 3 iv. Major Risks: The major risks both in year and future are listed in table 43 .

The Tru st declared a position of compliance to the following three licence conditions; this is evidenced through the Audit Committee in April and May 2018 and the Trust Board May 2018. Condition G6: The provider has taken all precautions necessary to comply with the lic ence, NHS Acts and NHS Constitution; Condition FT4: The provider has complied with required governance arrangements; Condition CoS7: If providing commissioner requested services, the provider has a reasonable expectation that required re sources will be available to deliver the designated service. In respect of the principal risks to compliance with the NHS FT condition 4 (FT Governance), The Walton Centre has a Board of Directors and has established a committee structure with associated reporting lines, performance and risk management systems. Each committee is chaired by a non -executive director and has an associated executive team member as its executive lead. The Board of Directors and Board Committees receive timely and accurate info rmation to assess risks to compliance with the Trust's provider licence, and have the requisite degree and rigour of oversight over the Trust's performance. To assure itself of the validity of its annual governance statement required under NHS FT Conditio n 4 (8) b, the Board of Directors receives an annual assurance statement and associated 111 evidence. The Board of Directors approve quarterly reports for submission to the sector regulator NHSI, regarding its principal risks to compliance with its Governance and Continuity of Service ratings Mersey Internal Audit Agency completed 13 reviews of the systems of internal control during the year. Four achieved high assurance, eight achieved significant assurance and one of the reviews received limited assurance. The review that achieved limited assurance had been supported by robust action plans in order to address the recom mendations . The Trust was subject to a full \"Well Led\" self -assessment as required by NHSI in 2015 and completed a subsequent initial self -assessment against the NHSI Well Led framework in 2018; this review was facilitated by an external reviewer. The Trust will undergo a second full self -assessment in December of 2019. Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response (EPRR) The NHS England Core Standards for Emergency Preparedness Resilience and Response (EPRR) are the minimum standards which NHS organisations and providers of NHS funded care must meet. The Trust is required to follow the EPRR framework and delivery of the NHS England Core Standa rds. These are the minimum standards which NHS Organisations and providers of NHS funded care must meet and provide assurance around EPRR to the Commissioning Board. In 2017/18 the Trust has continued to invest both time and resources in its emergency prep aredness, resilience and response. The 2017/18 self -assessment against the NHS England Core Standards shows that , of the 45 applicable standards, the Trust is fully compliant. In 2017/18, the Trusts EPRR arrangements were revised taking into account the learning from the Manchester Arena and Westminster Bridge incidents. This learning has resulted in a clear improvement of the Trust's emergency preparedness, as demonstrated by: 1. The T rust achieving full compliance against all of NHS England's core standa rds for EPRR. 2. The Trust Major Incident Plan and associated action cards were revised with input from Consultant Surgeons/Anaesthetists. 3. A review of on call arrangements and associated training for Tactical and Strategic Commanders. 4. Training for On -call man agers. 5. A successful clinically led Major Incident exercise - Brave Defender II. 6. Continued joint working with Aintree Major Trauma Centre and participation in a joint exercise in February 2018. 7. Continued review and testing of Business Continuity Plans. 112 A new EPRR work programme for 2018/19 will be overseen by the Trust's Resilience Planning Group and, if completed in full, will enable the Trust in 2018/19 to achieve full compliance against all of NHS Eng land's core standards for EPRR. Review of economy, e fficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources The Trust has a very well established mechanism for setting financial plans and ensuring that these are met. The Trust has also undertaken a detailed review of its income and expenditure budgets prior to setting its annual plans for 2018/19 . The financial position is reviewed in detail at the Trust's Business Performance Committee meetings and at the Board of Directors meeting. A full description of all key activity, income and expenditure variances is c overed in that report along with a full analysis of capital expenditure against plan, cash flow and the Trust's Use of Resource risk rating. The Board of Directors has been proactive in identifying and agreeing financial risks and mitigations and this pr ocess is on -going. The Trust has a well -established system for identifying and managing financial risk. Internal audit has played a key role in providing assurance that financial systems are operating adequately and the Trust is continually striving to i mprove the effectiveness of its financial controls. As an employer with staff entitled to membership of the NHS Pension Scheme, control measures are in place to ensure all employer obligations contained within the Scheme regulations are complied with. This includes ensuring that deductions from salary, employer's contributions and payments into the Scheme are in accordance with the Scheme rules, and that member Pension Scheme records are accurately updated in accordance with the timescales detailed in the R egulations. Control measures are in place to ensure that all obligations in relation to equality, diversity and human rights legislation are complied with. The Foundation Trust has undertaken risk assessments and carbon reduction delivery plans are in pl ace in accordance with emergency preparedness and civil contingency requirements, as based on UKCIP 2009 weather projects, to ensure that the obligations for the Trust under the Climate Change Act and the Adaptation Reporting requirements are complied with . Information Governance With regard to information security risks, the Trust has a nominated Senior Information Risk Officer (SIRO) at executive level who has nominated responsibility for information risk. The Trust has maintained a minimum level 2 scor e across all of the 45 standards within the Information Governance toolkit and has scored 85% (green) compared with 86% (green) in the previous year. Information Governance training is provided as part of induction for all new staff and refresher training forms part of the Trust's mandatory training programme. The Trust has successfully gained accreditation against the ISO27001 (2013) standard in relation to Information and IT security. The Trust once again received 'Significant Assurance' from Mersey Inte rnal Audit following a review of its Information Governance (IG) toolkit evidence for the 113 seventh year in succession. During the period of reporting, there have been four serious incidents, three involving confidentiality and the other a third party Infor mation Security breach which were scored at Level 2 using the Information Governance Reporting tool which were duly reported to the Information Commissioner Office (ICO). The Trust has received notification from the ICO that no further action by them was necessary due to the remedial action taken by the Trust. Annual Quality Report The directors are required under the Health Act 2009 and the National Health Service (Quality Accounts) Regulations 2010 (as amended) to prepare Quality Accounts for each financial year. NHS Improvement (in exercise of the powers conferred on Monitor) has issued guidance to NHS foundation trust boards on the form and content of annual Quality Reports which incorporate the above legal requirements in the NHS Foundation Trust Annual Reporting Manual . A number of steps have been put in place to assure the Boa rd that the quality report gives a balanced view, and that there are appropriate controls in place to ensure data quality such as: The Trust Board has a good balance of skills and knowledge to provide appropriate challenge to data. The Trust supports a col lective leadership approach which ensures a balance in the decision making process. Policies ensure that the quality of care provided is consistent and adheres to the Walton Way Values. There is a clear governance structure which facilitates the movement o f information from ward to board. Review of effectiveness As Accounting Officer, I have responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. My review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control is informed by the w ork of the internal auditors, clinical audit and the executive directors, senior managers and clinical leads within the Trust who have responsibility for the development and maintenance of the internal control framework. I have drawn on the content of the quality report attached to this Annual Report and other performance information available to me. My review is also informed by comments made by the external auditors in their management letter and other reports. I have been advised on the implications o f the result of my review of the effectiveness of the system of internal control by the board, the audit committee and a plan to address weaknesses and ensure continuous improvement of the system is in place. 114 The Trust has a governance structure which ens ures that the effectiveness of the system of internal control is fit for purpose. The Board of Directors has a clear idea of its responsibilities and the Directors have a suitable balance of knowledge, skills and experience which enables robust challenge of the systems of internal control. The Audit Committee acts independently from the executive ensuring that stakeholders are properly protected in relation to financial reporting and internal control The Quality Committee has continued to improve the proce ss of internal control through the introdu ction of two initiatives; \"what quality means to you\" which requires divisional representatives to present to the committee on issues within their areas and presentations relating to the Darzi Principles. Both of these initiatives provide a more detailed perspective on the internal control processes to inform the committee. Furthermore MIAA reviewed the Quality Committee 's compliance with its terms of reference and noted good compliance. The clinical audit function continues to develop since being devolved in to the divisions and provides robust assurance on outcomes through its governance links. The Trust's internal auditors play a major part in challenging and providing assurance against the systems of internal co ntrol. Conclusion No significant internal control issues have been identified during the reporting year. Chief Executive, 25 May 2018 115 4 Quality Report Please refer to the Trust's Quality Account (enclosed at the end of this report) for a detailed analysis of the following: Care Quality Commission Registration The Trust is required to register with the Care Quality Commission (CQC). Its current registration status is 'Registered without Conditions'. Quality Governance 4.1 Quality Governance The Trust developed and implemented a Quality and Patient Safety Strategy in 2015, replacing the previous Quality Governance Strategy. The Quality and Patient Safety Strategy is a three year strategy, with an ov erarching aim to ensure Excellence in Neurosciences. It builds on previous progress through the Quality Governance Strategy and other patient safety initiatives and action plans taking the next steps for The Walton Centre a highly specialist tertiary centr e going 'from good to great'. The Strategy sets out the way forward for the three years using the five foundations which we have agreed following consultation with The Walton Centre 's staff. These are based in particular from the learning from the Berwick Review and also the King's Fund's work in relation to collective leadership and culture in the NHS. The five foundations are: Foundation 1 - Leadership at all levels Foundation 2 - Culture of continuous learning Foundation 3 - Patient engagement Foundation 4 - Build capacity and skills Foundation 5 - Measurement to predict It is a key enabling strategy of the overall Trust Strategy with several of its objectives, underpinnin g the quality elements, development of the Trust's services and The Walton Centre 's workforce. In turn, the Quality and Patient Safety Strategy has its own supporting strategies in particular the Patient Experience Strategy. Furthermore it is closely linke d with the Organisational Development Strategy. 116 Quality information is monitored at departmental, divisional and at board level. It includes patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience information and is considered by the Quality Committ ee and the Board of Directors at their meetings. The Board is satisfied that, to the best of its knowledge and using its own processes and having had regard to Monitor's Quality Governance Framework, that the Trust has, and will keep in place, effective ar rangements for the purpose of monitoring and continually improving the quality of healthcare provided to our patients. To ensure compliance with the Care Quality Commission registration regulations, each regulation is part of a planned schedule of reviews which work alongside internal quality inspections . The N ursing Assessment and Accreditation System is an example of this and wards are currently classed as having a \"green\" status (good). This year, the Trust has continued to develop the Board Assurance Framework (BAF) and review and refine the committee structures reporting to the Board of Directors. The Governance Department has continued to review and enhance its staffing structures with key appointments and further strengthening of health and safety and business continuity plans within the Trust which have had external scrutiny. The Trust is committed to delivering outstanding care for patients and monitors quality and safety on a dail y basis. Safety is review ed each morning at the Trust safety huddle, which allows staff to escalate any concerns relating to patient, visitor or staff safety. Themes are shared with Trust Board quarterly. Quality and safety is discussed at various commi ttees, which then provide chairs r eports to Trust Board following each meeting . Key performance indicators are provided to committees so that improvements and key risks can be viewed and risk mitigated. Where improvements have been observed, lessons to be shared are also managed trust wide. The Quality A ccounts for 2017/18 were all achieved with the feedback received from our specialised commissioners and Healthwatch. The Patient Experience Team have been recognised by Healthwatch for their engagement with patients and this is noted within the Quality Account feed back. Engagement information is shared with th e Patient Experience Group and is also escalated to Trust Board with key themes of improvement work. 117 The Board of Directors consulted with patients , governors, commissioners, Healthwatch and other external agencies to ascertain and agree the Trust's Quality Account improvement priorities fo r 2018/19 . The Trust continues to monitor servic es across the three domains of quality: patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience, reporting progress on the improvement priorities to the Quality Committee and to the Board of Directors on a regular basis. Quality priorities are monitored and performance managed by the Board of Directors and by the Quality Committee. Operational groups within the Trust are made aware of their responsibilities in relation to quality priorities and report to Board committees. The Trust's Internal Auditor, Mersey Internal Audit Agen cy (MIAA), are fully involved in the process to provide regular review and assurance via the Audit Committee. In addition, quarterly meetings to review quality assurance reports take place with the Trust's commissioners, ensuring external scrutiny and pe rformance management. Further details with regards to the Trust's statement in relation to quality governance can be found in the Annual Gov ernance Statement included earlier in this report. Further information can also be found within the Quality Accounts section of this document. Membe rship At the end of March 2018, the Trust's membership stood at 7,426 compared to 7,565 in March 2017. The Trust's membership is available to both employees of the Trust and also patients, carers, volunteers and members of the public, aged 16 years and over, who live in the public constituencies of Cheshire, Merseyside, North Wales or the R est of England & Wales. Table 44 provides a breakdown of the Trust's membership by constituency: Table 44 Numbers by Constituency and Catchments Public Cheshire 872 Public Merseyside 2,585 Public North Wales 1,457 Public Rest of England and Wales 1,162 118 Numbers by Constituency and Catchments Public Out of Trust Area 7 Public Totals 6,083 Staff - Registered Nurse 383 Staff Registered Medical Practitioners 150 Staff Other Clinical Professional 458 Staff - Non-Clinical 352 Staff Total 1,343 TOTAL MEMBERSHIP 7,426 The Trust's Membership Strategy can be found at: www.thewaltoncentre.nhs.uk/173/being - a-member . The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust is a public benefit organisation and its objective, with respect to membership, is to recruit, retain and develop a sizeable, representative and active membership which i s engaged with the objectives of the Trust. Information for prospective members is posted on the Trust's website. The Trust is committed to building a membership representative of both the population it cares for and the staff who work for the Trust. Memb ership is therefore open to any individual who is eligible to be a member of the public or staff constituencies. To ensure effective member engagement the Trust produces a quarterly newsletter called Neuromatters. Copies are posted/emailed to public member s and are prominently displayed around the Trust to encourage membership. The newsletter is also available on the intranet, website and via social media. During 2016 the Trust introduced a Governors email newsletter called 'Connect' which is sent quarterly to all members who have elected to receive email communications. The newsletter is also available on the website Governors page. During 2017 the Trust and Governors undertook the following membership engagement activities: Annual Members Meeting Governor take-over day on the Trusts' Twitter and Facebook social media platforms Articles in Neuromatters membership magazine 119 Patient engagement and listening events at Satellite Clinics Patient Listening Weeks Staff Listening Weeks Berwick Sessions Swartz Round s There is a dedicated email address which makes it simpler for members and prospective members to contact the Membership Manager: membership@thewaltoncentre.nhs.uk 4.2 Patient Experience To demonstrate our commitment to continually improving the patient experience, we have a Patient Experience Strategy to focus on ensuring our patients remain at the centre of everything we do. This strategy ensures that patients are involved and receive a n experience that not only meets, but also exceeds, their physical and emotional needs and expectations. Based on feedback from patients and staff, the strategy has been used to underpin the Trust strategic aims around the Walton Way values, encompassing excellent patient experience and design actions to help the Trust achieve its strategic objective of: \"We treat our patients and colleagues with caring, respect, dignity, openness and pride. This is The Walton Way\" This will encompass the areas of im provement that patients have informed the Trust about , as well as being based on \"what does excelle nt patient experience look like?\" The purpose of this Strategy is to: Raise standards and expectations of patient, family and carer experience at The Walton Centre Define the action required by staff throughout The Walton Centre to improve patient experience Provide a framework of action for priorities and to clarify responsibility for action Ensure the current national drivers and standards for patient experience, together with The Walton Way underpin our ambition Ensure the Patient Experience Strategy contributes effectively to the Quality Strategy and ultimately to the strategic objectives of the Trust. 120 Further information on the progress in relation to patient experience can be found within the Quality Account section of this document. The Patient Experience Strategy is available at: http://www.thewaltoncentre.nhs.uk/169/t rust- publications.html 4.3 Patient Care The nursing workforce is reviewed on a 6-monthly basis in line with national guidance using various tools and data is triangulated with nurse sensitive indicators to ensure that staffing is appropriate and safe. The senior nursing team provide leadership across clinical areas and ensure that there is a continued focus on nursing standards, the environment, patient safety and enhanced patient and family experience. As part of their work, the team review staffing on a shift by shift basis to ensure that changes in acuity and occupancy are considered and managed accordingly, in line with The Walton Centre outstanding status. The last staffing report was presented to the Trust Board in November 2017. Where staff hav e requested to do long days instead of single shifts, this has allowed greater flexibility with staffing numbers to support enhanced levels of care and enable staff to have an improved work -life balance. The nursing establishment planned versus actual re sults are revie wed by the Director of Nursing and Governance and are presented to various Committees prior to their monthly submission to NHS England and the Trust website. The unify return is cross referenced with friends and family data, registered nurse to patient ratio, nurse sensitive indicators and occupancy rates. In 2017, there has been a significant focus on effective recruitment and retention of registered nurses to ensure that staffing is to its optimum. Work has been conducted alongside NHS Improvement and focussed on recruitment, support of staff in the workplace, equality, diversity and inclusion and retention . As a consequence the Trust has seen the turnover of registered nurses reduce significantly. The Trust has worked hard in 2017/18 to support the reduction of healthcare acquired infections and has seen considerable reductions. The Trust has however had one MRSA bacteraemia in -year against a zero trajectory ; a full root cause analysis has been carried out with lessons learned shared Trust -wide. The annual trajectory of Clostridium Difficile was 10 cases for Public Health England (PHE ), with the Trust reporting seven cases this year . 121 Clostridium difficile continues to remain a challenge for the Trust going forward however work continue s to support this reduction . The Trust has also successfully managed Carbapenemase -producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) infections. The Trust screens all high risk patients on admission and undertakes regular screening in the areas containing high risk pat ients in the Trust. The Trust introduc ed a more time ly and accurate screening medium , 'PCR' , to allow the reduction in disruption of activity and to provide a better patient experience for patients who need to be screened following contact with an infected patient or on admission. This has allowed patients to be managed more effectively throughout the hospital. The Walton Centre observed a 28% reduction in catheter associated urinary tract infect ions (CAUTI) by introducing catheter diaries to support the clear communication of catheter management. Quality indicators are monitored via the Quality C ommittee which is chaired by a Non - Executive D irector. 4.4 Commissioning for Quality and Innovation Payment Framework (CQUIN) Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) was introduced in 2009 with the principle that a proportion of healthcare providers' income was conditional upon demonstrating improvemen ts in quality and innovation in specified areas of patient care. This means that a proportion of The Walton Centre 's income is dependent on achieving quality and innovation goals. The antici pated CQUIN income that the Trust expects to receive for 17/18 is \u00a31.6m. This is subject to final validation around Q4 CQUIN delivery. For the first time , CQUIN schemes were instigated for two years with the following goals agre ed for both 2017/18 and 2018/19: Clinical Utilisation Review Critical care Timely Dischar ge (4 hr Target) Spinal Networks Medicines Optimisation Digital Maturity Health and Wellbeing Advice and Guidance 122 E-Referrals Further details of the agreed goals for 2017/18 and for the following 12 month period are available on request from enquiries@thewaltoncentre.nhs.uk . The Quality Committee reports directly to the Board of Directors on issues of quality governance and risks that may affect patient experience, patient ou tcomes or pati ent safety. This C ommittee also has responsibility for reviewing the Trust's Quality Accounts. Review and planning events involving patients, staff, governors and Healthwatch identified the areas of focus in respect of quality for the forthcoming year. Key performance indicators and priorities relating to quality were identified and their performance is monitored by various Committees and the Board of Directors on a monthly basis. The development of the Trust's Quality Account and reporting have also been a greed by the Board of Directors and the Trust's Council of Governors has been fully involved in the development of the Trust's quality priorities. External overview has been provided by the Trust's lead commissioner and opinion on the draft report has been sought from Healthwatch. The Overview and Scrutiny Committee, specialist commissioners and Healthwatch have had the o pportunity to review the Quality Account. Patient Experience and Complaints Handling The Patient Experience Team provides help, advice and support to patients and their families, as well as helping to resolve concerns quickly on a patient's behalf. This can be prior to, during or after their visit to the Trust. The Patient Experience Team can be contacted by telephone or can visit a patient on a ward or at one of our Outpatient clinics. Where concerns cannot be easily resolved or are of a more serious nature, the Patient Experience Team are responsible for dealing with complaints on behal f of patients and their families. We pride ourselves in working with patients and staff throughout the Trust to resolve complaints in a timely way and to explain our actions and to evidence how services will be improved as a result of a complaint. Our pos itive approach to managing and resolving complaints was recognised by Rob Behrens, Parliamentary and Health Serv ice Ombudsman when he visited the Trust in June 2017. We were the first NHS organisation Mr Behrens visited after coming into post. He commented \"The Walton Centre 's strong commitment to patient experience was particularly evident; the senior leadership, the complaints teams and frontline staff I spoke to were committed to continuous improvement and saw responding to patient feedback and 123 complaint s as central to this. The Trust had also focused on staff health and wellbeing as they saw a link between mistakes and staff feeling stressed and unable to cope.\" Trend Analysis and Lessons Learned Every complaint is investigated and each complainant rece ives a detailed response from the Chief Executive. We ensure those responses are open and transparent, and provide assurance that where mistakes have been made, those are rectified and we learn the lessons. Outcomes from complaints are reported monthly t o committees within the Trust, and to the Executive Team. Longer term trends are reported to the Patient Experience Group, the Board and Council of Governors. Trends and actions taken are also discussed in detail in the Governance and Risk Quarterly repo rt, the monthly divisional governance and risk group meetings and Quality Committee. Examples of lessons learned from complaints during 2017/18 include revision to the rapid discharge pathway, improvements to accessibility of patient information, improvements to the patient administration system, improvement to the radiology reporting proc ess, and reflection for teams and individual staff members. Complaints Activity We use feedback from people who have used the complaints process to help us improve our responsiveness and service. Following the restructure of the Patient Experience team in 2016/17, we reviewed our processes, making them more accessible to patients and families. We have developed a person centred approach so that complainants are kept involved and updated at each stage of the investigation, with regular contact from members of the Patient Experience Team. The number of c omplaints received 01 April 2017 - 31 March 2018 are noted in table 45 . Table 45 Quarter 1 April-June 17 Quarter 2 July-Sept 17 Quarter 3 Oct- Dec 17 Quarter 4 Jan-Mar 18 Number of complaints received 27 34 41 30 The Trust received 13 2 complaints during 2017/18 , compared with 102 complaints received in 2016/17. A key element of the person centred approach is focusing on the individual outcomes patients and families are seeking when they raise concerns. The Patient Experience Team 124 make contact with the patient or relative once a complaint is received to agree the best way of addressing their concerns. This individualised approach has led to many patients or relatives wishing to resolve their concerns informal ly rather than pursuing the formal complaints procedure. Patient Experience Strategy and Patient and Public Engagement The Trust has a Patient Experience Strategy that underpins the Trust strategic aims around the Walton Way values . During the course of the current three year strategy, the Trust has maintained its position as one of the leading organisations for providing excellent patient experience. During 2017/18 there has been significant engagement with patients, families and ca rers to identify what matters to them and what represents an excellent patient experience for them. This has been central to the Vanguard programme and the engagement activity has been enhanced working with the MS Society, Neurological Alliance, Brain Char ity, Healthwatch Sefton, Liverpool and Knowsley. Building on these improvements to engage with patients, families and stakeholders during the current strategy, the Trust is in a good position to further develop this in incorporating patient and family voi ce into the new Trust Vision and Strategy. Volunteers Following the introduction of the Volunteer Coordinator role in 2016, the volunteer service has continued to grow at the Trust. At the end of Quarter 3, we ha d 65 volunteers contributing almost 900 hours per month on average. In addition to the Neuro Buddy role, volunteers have been providing a valuable service in roles relating to research, Meet and Greet, trolley service, befriending, infection prevention and control, administrative duties and assisting the Pain Management Programme. There is extensive support for volunteers and close monitoring of volunteer activity. This was reflected in the MIAA audit of the volunteer service conducted during 2017/18. MIAA audited the processes in line with nati onal guidelines and established practice and rated the Trust's volunteer service as 'Significant Assurance'. National Inpatient Survey The results of the 2016 National Inpatient Survey (published in May 2017) highlighted that The Walton Centre maintaine d its position as one of the leading trusts for patient experience. 125 Overall, the Trust was 'better than most other trusts' in seven areas and 'the same' in three others, which was an improvement on the previous year. The Trust was not 'worse than most other Trusts' in any of the questions asked. The Trust was better than most other trusts when it came to patients' experience of: Waiting for a bed on a ward The hospital and ward Doctors Nurses Care and treatment Overall views of care and services Overall experience It was 'about the same' as other trusts on patient experience of waiting lists; operations and procedures, and leaving hospital. Statistics show The Walton Centre is consistently achieving positive results in this survey year on year. Figures from the past four years show a steady increase with more and more questions showing that The Walton Centre has been rated as being among the best performing Trusts nationally . For the full survey results for The Walton Centre visit www.cqc.org.uk/cqc_survey/3 The 201 7 survey results will be presented to the Patient Experience Group , Quality Committee and Trust Board, once re ceived, and an action plan developed to support any areas that require improvement. Research and Innovation The Trust continue s to recognise the importance of Research and Innovation during 2017/18. The Neuroscience Research Centre (NRC) aims to : Work collaboratively to facilitate high quality clinical and healthcare research; Support the development and adoption of innovation; Reduce the timeline for study set up ; Ensure its quality management system s and processes are fit for purpose and compliant with statutory regulations; Align its functions to Walton Way values and behaviours . 126 The NRC continues to work with clinicians to embed the Trust's Research, Development and Innovation Strategy so that research and innovat ion are integral to the Trust's day -to-day activities, making research and innovation everyone's business. The NRC has recruit ed 1039 patients in 2017/ 2018. There a re currently 85 clinical studies on-going at The Walton Centre and participation in clinical research demonstrates the Trust's commitment to improving the quality of care. The Trust continues to recruit patients and relatives to the Genome Medicine Centre in Liverpool, which is part of the Government's flagship 100,000 Genome Project. During 201 7/18, the Trust has worked in partnership with the following networks and organisations to attract NIHR funding to deliver clinical research and share research outputs and innovation s to inform service transformation and improvement: Clinical Research Network : North West Coast (CRN) Liverpool Health Partners (LHP) The Innovation Agency, the North West Coast Academic Health Science Network , (NWC AHSN) North West Coast Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (NWC CLAHRC) Local Universities Other NHS trusts and NHS organisations Pharmaceutical companies (industry) The Trust was shortlisted in four categories in the North West Research & Innovation Awards for 2 018 and won the Clinical Research Rising Star of the Year award. Clinical Audit During 201 7/18, eight national audits and three confidential enquiries covered NHS services provided by the Trust. National Audits Adult Critical Care (ICNARC / Case Mix programme) 127 The case mix programme is an audit of patient outcomes from adult critical care units. Data is collected on all patients admitted to Horsley Intensive Care Unit and submitted securely. The data sent is compared with outcomes from similar pati ents and analysed. The Trust receives quarterly data analysis reports which identify trends over time and shows how it compares to other units. Thes e reports are discussed at the ICNARC Review Group Meetings and aim to assist with decision -making, resourc e allocation and local quality improvement. An audit of re -admissions for subarachnoid haemorrhage patients is currently being undertaken . Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) TARN audits the pathway and outcomes of patients admitted to the Trust as a result of a traumatic injury. Data collected for patients admitted is submitted securely and clinical reports are published by TARN three times a year specifically focusing on head and spinal injuries, orthopaedic injuries and thoracic and a bdominal in juries. These reports along with monthly performance and activity reports are discussed at the quarterly internal trauma services meeting and the monthly Aintree University Hospital / Walton Major Trauma Clinical Assurance meeting. They are also discussed at the Major Trauma Centre Collaborative Board (MTCC). TARN, since October 2014, are working alongside Quality Health to collect Major Trauma Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROM s), measures are collected before the patient's discharge and TARN follow up 6 months post injury. PROMs performance reports are published quarterly and are fed back in the quarterly internal trauma services meeting , any patients experiencing severe -extrem e problems 6 months from injury are discussed in the trauma -rehab MDT to see what further care can be provided. The provision of this accurate and relevant information is vital to help doctors, nurses and managers improve their services. The Trust will co ntinue to submit data to TARN and will review individual cases as appropriate Falls and Fragility Fractures Audit Programme - National Audit of Inpatient Falls 2015 - 2017 This audit is funded through the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP) a nd is carried out by the Clinical Effectiveness and Evaluation Unit (CEEU) of the Royal College of Physicians. The Falls Workstream is currently contracted to deliver the first National Audit of Inpatient Falls (NAIF), a clinically led, web -based audit of inpatient falls prevention care in acute hospitals in England and Wales. NAIF aims to improve inpatient falls prevention through aud it and quality improvement. Round tw o of the audit was undertaken in May 2017 128 and the report was published November 2017. The report has been reviewed by the Falls Prevention Steering group and a work plan has been produced. National Emergency Laparotomy Audit NELA is being carried out by the National Institute of Academic Anaesthesia's Health Services Research Centre (HS RC) on behalf of the Royal College of Anaesthetists (RCoA), The audit aims to enable improvement of the quality of care for patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. The Trust does not perform many of these procedures but it continues to submit data for t he cases it does have securely. The Trust submitted 100% of the applicable cases in the data collection period. Specialist Rehabilitation for Patients with Complex Needs Following Major Injury The audit will provide a national comparative assessment of the organisation, quality, outcomes and efficacy of specialist rehabilitation services provided for adults with complex needs following major injury (physical injury caused by events such as road traffic accidents, falls, etc .) It aims to drive improved a nd equitable access to specialist rehabilitation services. Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust is submitting data securely via the TARN database. Findings are discussed at regional and local trauma group meetings. The Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP) The clinical audit collects a minimum data set for stroke patients in England, Wales and Northern Ireland in every acute hospital, and follows the pathway through recovery, rehabilitation, and outcomes at the point of 6 month assessment. Originally The Wa lton Centre NHS Foundation Trust was not required to submit data to this audit, however, following changes made to include thrombectomy data the Trust has started to submit information for the patients who have had a thrombectomy procedure at The Walton Ce ntre. Data collection is on -going and the audit resu lts are published quarterly. The process for collecting SSNAP data is currently under review and actions have been identified to improve data submission. National Comparative Audit of Blood Transfusion (NCABT) The National Comparative Audit of Blood Transfusion is a programme of clinical audits which looks at the use and administration of blood components in NHS and independent hospitals in England and North Wales. Schedule of audits 2017: - 1. Audit of O negative red cells Winter / Spring 2018 - not applicable to WCFT 129 2. Audit of red cell & antiplatelet transfusion in adult haematology patients - not applicable to WCFT 3. TACO audit - applicable to WCFT The Trust submitted 100% of the cases to the TACO audit and is awaiting the publication of the report. National Neurosurgery Audit Programme (NNAP) The Neurosurgical National Audit Programme (NNAP) was established by the Society of British Neurological Surgeons in 2013 as part of a major quality improvement i nitiative. The programme aims to support neurosurgical units in the UK and Ireland to improve patient care, outcomes, safety, and experience by providing high quality, robust audit data that is analysed and presented in a consistent and clinically relevan t way. The analysis of audit data found that The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trusts is one of the busiest units in the country, with very good performance / outcomes and low mortality rates. National Confidential Enquiries (NCEPOD) The purpose of NCEPO D (National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death) is to assist in maintaining and improving standards of medical and surgical care for the benefit of the public by reviewing the management of patients. This involves undertaking confidential surveys and research and by publishing and generally making available the results of such activities, in order to maintain and improve quality of patient outcomes. There were three studies The Walton Centre was eligible to participate i n during 2017 /18. Perioperative Diabetes The aim of this study is to identify and explore remediable factors in the process of care, in the peri -operative management of surgical patients with diabetes across the whole patient pathway from referral for surgery, (elective) or admission to hospital (emergency) to discharge from hospital. This will include: To examine organisational structures, processes, protocols and care pathways in hospitals from pre -admission through to discharge or death To identify avoidable and remediable factors in the management of patients The patient identifier spreadsheet was completed and submitted to NCEPOD within the set timeframe. NCEPOD selected 6 cases from The Walton Centre to be included in the study. A Consultant and Anaesthetist questionnaire was completed for each case and submitted 130 within the set timescale along with copies of the patient notes. The report is due to be published in winter 2018 . Cancer in Children, Teens and Young Adults The aims of this study are to review the process of care of children, Teens and Young Adults under the age of 25 years who died/ or had an unplanned admission to critical care within 30 days of receiving systemic anti -cancer therapy in order to: Look at the decision making and consent process around the prescription of Systemic Anti -Cancer Therapy (SACT ) in this group of patients. Explore remediable factors in the quality of care provided to patients during the final line of therapy. Look at preventable causes of treatment -related mortality in young people's cancers. Look at the configuration of the service and organizational structures in place for the safe delivery of SACT to children, teenagers and young adults. The Data request and Organisational Questionnaire have been completed and submit ted to the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD ) within the set timeframe. The report is due to be published September 2018 . Chronic Neurodisability, focusing on cerebral palsy study The aim of this study is to identify the remediable factors in the quality of care provided to children and young people with chronic disabling conditions, focusing in particular on cerebral palsies. This will include: To examine the interface between different care settings To examine the tr ansition of care There are 10 Organisational Questionnaires for this study; however, only 4 of these are applicable to the Trust. The relevant questionnaires have been completed and submitted to NCEPOD within the required timeframe. The report is due to be published in March 2018. Local Audits During 201 7/18, the Trust also participated in 100 local clinical audits. All action plans received are discussed, monitored and signed off by the Clinical Audit Group. The Clinical Audit Teams for each Divisio n produce a monthly clinical audit activity status report which includes recommended actions from all completed projects for each division and the progress made towards implementation. These reports and actions are monitored monthly at the Divisional Gove rnance and Risk meetings. 131 An annual clinical audit event is also held at the Trust for staff to share their work and learning from audits undertaken for the purpose of service improvement and improving clinical knowledge. Never Events During 2017/18 the Trust reported 3 Never Events. The requirements of the Duty of Candour regulations were followed in all instances ensuring openness and transparency. All incidents were subject to thorough investigation with root cause analysis being completed; lesson s learnt were shared within the divisions. Conclusion The Trust had made continuous improvements during 2017/18, meeting all of its financial and operational targets. This was a significant achievement, given the ongoing challenges faced by the NHS. The Chair and Chief Executive paid tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff and the many supporters of the Trust, including volunteers, support groups, charitable groups, fundraisers, members, governors, current and previous patients. 132 Quality Account 2017 - 2018 133 Part 1 Statement on Quality from the Chief Executive Part 2 Priorities for improvement and Statements of Assurance from the Board Improvement Priorities 2.1 How well have we done in 2017 -18? 2.1.1 Patient Safety 2.1.2 Clinical Effectiveness 2.1.3 Patient Experience 2.2 What are our priorities for 2018 -19? 2.2.1 Patient Safety 2.2.2 Clinical Effectiveness 2.2.3 Patient Experience 2.3 Statements of Assurance from the Board 2.3.1 Data Quality 2.3.2 Participation in Clinical Audit and National Confidential Enquiries 2.3.3 National Audits 2.3.4 National Confidential Enquiries 2.3.5 Participation in Local Clinical Audits 2.3.6 Participation in Clinical Research and Development 2.3.7 CQUIN Framework 2.3.8 CQUIN Perf ormance Quality Commission (CQC) Registration 2.3.10 Trust Data Quality 2.3.11 Learning from Deaths 2.3.12 Implementing Clinical Standards for Seven Day Hospital Services Part 3 Overview of Quality 2017/18 3.1 Complaints 3.2 Local Engagement - Quality Account 3.3 Quality Governance 3.4 Vanguard - The Neuro Network 3.5 Social Media (Instagram) 134 3.6 Sky Light 3.7 Patient Advice Line 3.8 Volunteers 3.9 Theatre Scanner iMRI 3.10 Helipad 3.11 Health and Work Champion 3.12 Launch Bio Bank 3.13 National Guardian 3.14 Robotic Arm 3.15 Overview of Performance in 2017/18 against National Priorities from the Department of Health's Operating Framework 3.16 Overview of Performance in 2017/18 against NHS Outcomes Framework 3.17 Indicators Annex 1 Statements from Commissioners, Local Healthwatch Organisations and Overview and Scrutiny Committees Annex 2 Statement of Directors' responsibilities for the Quality Report Glossary of Terms 135 Part 1 Statement on Quality from the Chief Executive We are delighted to share the Quality Account 2017 / 2018 for The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust which demonstrates our commitment to deliver quality care to our patients that we serve, enabling, \"Excellence in Neuroscience\". This report details our pe rformance over the last year whilst also highlighting our key priorities for 2018 / 2019. The Walton Centre NHS FT has continued to work in collaboration with our stakeholders in both 2017/2018 priorities and those identified for the fore -coming year wit h the Council of Governors, patient representatives, specialist commissioning and members of Healthwatch. In addition, the Quality Account incorporates information relating to compliance with national audits, complaints and information relating to research governance and data quality. 2017 / 2018 has been an exciting year, with significant changes noted across our Executive and senior leadership teams and our aim of delivering quality care in relation to patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient ex perience has remained our priority. As the new Chief Executive Officer, I stand firm to supporting the quality agenda and enabling our staff to achieve this. We have taken various approaches to the delivery of quality care, by working with various teams ac ross the hospital as well as across the region of Cheshire and Merseyside to ensure that quality care is delivered in the right place, at the right time. The Trust has a robust performance management framework, developed with Commissioners and with the Wel sh Health Specialised Services Committee. NHS England (Cheshire and Merseyside) as specialist commissioner undertakes the lead in performance managing the Trust against its statutory and NHS plan targets as part of the local health economy review process a nd regular contract quality performance meetings have taken place. Since achieving our CQC outstanding rating in April 2016, The Walton Centre NHS FT has continued to strive for and deliver on the quality agenda for patients. The quality priorities for 2017/2018 have been achieved and are detailed within this Quality Account. In addition, this year we have achieved: A positive visit from the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman in June 2017 recognising the Trust's commitment to continuous improvement Shortlisted as a finalist for the Health Service Journal for epilepsy management for pregnant women - outcome awaited 136 Creation of an Instagram account to increase opportunities of h ow patients communicate with us Reduction in complaints from 2016/2017 Commencement of a vision to enable a culture of equality, diversity and inclusion for staff to support our patients and their families Re-secured our achievement of Investors In People Gold standard Sky view ceiling system installed in Intensive care Introd uction of a Trust safety huddle Re-introduction of a patient advice telephone line Commissioning an in -theatre intra -operative magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI) scanner for use in complex surgery Opened two new theatres Piloted the introduction of open visiting times to support patient & family centred care Delivery of a new Renishaw Neuromate Robotic Arm to allow greater precision in minimally invasive surgery These initiatives are reported on within this report in fur ther detail. Such quality initiatives are discussed and debated through various Committees, including, the Audit Committee, the Quality Committee and Business Performance Committee in order to ensure that quality assurance is achieved. These Committees rep ort to Trust Board to ensure that patient safety is a priority and is progressed. The sub groups to the Quality Committee include Patient Safety Group, Clinical Effectiveness and Service Group, Infection Prevention and Control Committee and Patient Experi ence Group and items are discussed in detail to gain assurance and enable lessons to be identified and shared Trust -wide. The Professional Nurses Forum, Quality Committee and Trust Board all receive information related to the quality agenda and progress of each indicator is assessed and rated as Red, Amber or Green against expected performance levels. Staff within The Walton Centre NHS FT strive to deliver outstanding care and this is recognised by their achievements of 2017 / 2018 whilst working in par tnership with our patients and their families to meet and exceed their expectations. The commitment to patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience is appreciated and has enabled our successes. 137 In detailing our achievements and forthcoming priorities, I confirm that the information provided in this quality account is accurate and to the best of my knowledge. Hayley Citrine , Chief Executive 138 Part 2 Priorities for Improvement and Statements of Assurance from the Boar d Towards the end of each financial year, the Trust works closely with various stakeholders to identify areas of focus for improvement for the forthcoming year. At this time it also allows the Trust to reflect on the year's previous performance against the i dentified quality improvement priorities. The delivery of the quality improvement priorities are monitored through meetings of the Quality Committee, chaired by a Non -Executive Director, with sub groups focussing on the 3 domains of quality: patient safe ty, clinical effectiveness and patient experience. The Acting Director of Nursing and Governance is the Executive Lead responsible for delivering the plan and designates duties to operational leads for each of the priorities. All of the priorities were identified following a review by Trust Board on the domains of quality reported in 201 6/17. Consultation with patients, governors, commissioners, Healthwatch and other external agencies also informed the Board when focusing our priorities for 2017/18. The Trust is committed to embracing improvement across a wide range of issues to achieve excellence in all areas of care. The following section includes a report on progress against the three improvement priority areas for 2017/18. 139 2.1 Improvement Priorities for 2017 - 2018 - 'How well have we done?' In February 2018, the Board of Directors undertook a full review of quality indicators used by the Trust for the previous financial year and acknowledged the work implemented to ensure each indicator was on target to be achieved. At this review, quality priorities were identified and agreed for 2018/19. The improvement priorities all contained specific indicators which have been monitored over the last twelve months to provide evidence of sustainable improvement. Performance has been managed through subcommittees to Trust Board. Operational groups within the Trust have been responsible for the implementation of the quality priorities and reporting to committees as required. Merseyside Internal Audit Agency (MIAA) has been fully involved in the Trust during 2017/18, providing re gular reviews and assurance via the Audit Committee. Bi -monthly quality meetings to review quality assurance reports have taken place with the commissioners, ensuring external scrutiny and performance management. 2.1.1 Patient Safety Priority 1: Develo pment of a Surgical and Medical Acute Response Team ( SMART ) Database The Trust identified that one of the objectives to focus on during 2017/18 was the development of a database to capture the attendances of the SMART Team across the wards and their impact in the recovery and stabilisation of the deteriorating patient. The SMART team now have a database that has been capturing all the activity regarding the deteriorating patients and this has been evidenced in returns for 2017/18. The data collected is utilised to identify the number of cardiac arrests, patients with sepsis and attendances to support tracheostomy patients. The data is also utilised to support the Trust in the annual peer review undertaken by the Critical Care Network, providing evidence to inform quality of care and delivery of safe patient care Trust wide. The SMART team regularly feedback at Professional Nursing Forum, Infection Prevention and Control Committee and through the Tracheostomy Steering Group regarding changes in care delivery to ensure best practice. Outcome: Achieved A robust database is n ow in place which captures the activity of the SMART Team, enabling reports to be generated to assist in reviews of service and care planning. 140 An average of 60 patients per month were discharged from Critical C are of which 100% received a follow up visit from The SMART Team . An average of 260 visits are now completed per month by the SMART Team to patients who have transferred from Critical Care to the wards . This provides patients and their families with valua ble support physiologically, psychologically and physically. This has had a significant supportive impact collectively on patients, families and staff. Priority 2: Carbapenema se Producing Enterobacteriaceae ( CPE) Screening and Case Management CPE bacteri a normally live harmlessly in the bowel, however, if they enter into other areas such as the bladder or bloodstream, they can cause infection. Infection caused by a CPE can be difficult to treat as these bacteria can produce enzymes which destroy most available antibiotics. Screening for CPE is carried out to identify those patients who have acquired a CPE infection or who may be carriers of CPE (colonised). The Trust screens high risk patients as per care pathway. Outcome: Achieved Patients are s creened by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR) in line with national guidance. A CPE care pathway has been developed for the Trust. Implementation of the pathway provides a clear treatment plan for patients enabling the Trust to audit infection prevention and control strategies and improve patient experience. Isolation of patients is known to be a key area that many patients find difficult to adapt to the restrictions required. The pathway allows earlier identification of the need for additional psychologic al support and provide s the opportunity for the patient to discuss and plan their care with the multi -disciplinary team. The screening programme has allowed early detection of patients colonised with CPE which enables staff to implement appropriate infect ion prevention precautions and improve patient flow through the Trust. Priority 3: Develop Mental Capacity Act (MCA) Champions An MCA Champion is someone who will receive comprehensive training regarding the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA). The purpose of this training was to enable staff caring for patients to have the correct level of knowledge regarding MCA to ensure their safety. Outcome: Achieved 141 The Trust has a fully trained cohort of Mental Capacity Act Champions who are available to provide leadership and support to staff and patients. 2.1.2 Clinical Effectiveness Priority 1 : Same Day Admissions Same day admission describes the process whereby patients are admitted to hospital and have surgery on the same day. The move toward same -day surgery has been increasing over the year and has focused on limiting inpatient hospitalisation, reducing ancillary services and decreasing length of stay. Outcome: Achieved The Trust ha s implemented same day admission and have achieved a signif icant reduction in the number of patients being admitted the day before surgery. Priority 2: Improved Discharge Process The Trust identified that the discharge process needed to be improved to ensure patients were safely discharged to their place of care at a reasonable hour. This had a positive impact on patients awaiting admission to the Trust to ensure an enhanced exper ience. Timely discharge is important for good patient experience and discharge has been a key theme from our engagement events. In order to support this initiative the Trust identified a 10% target for patients being discharged by midday. Outcome: Achieved At least 10% of patients discharged from the Trust by noon on their day of discharge. Priority 3: Surgical site infection A surgical site infection occurs post surgery in the part of the body where the surgery was undertaken. The Trust monitors and reports infection rates that occur post surgery and notes a very low rate of surgical site infections compared to national data from other organisations. Shunt surgery has a higher incidence than other areas in the Trust and a review of process and practice in relation to this surgery, may identify further areas to focus on to reduce incidence. Outcome: Achieved 142 A retrospective audit of shunt infections identified between April 16 - December 17 was undertaken . During this period there were 11 recorded infections related to shunt surgery. The audit confirmed adherence to the Trust policy and no identification of clinical practice that was a cause for concern. The Trust continues to review surgical site infections and will take appropriate measures to address any inconsistencies identified in collaboration with the surgical teams. 2.1.3 Patient Experience Priority 1: Explore the development of a Nurse Bank The options available for the sourcing of temporary staff are numerous. At times it can be difficult to ensure the Trust is using the approach which best fits the individual organisational need. The Trust always ai ms to utilise substantive employees as effectively as possible before looking to fill vacant shifts through external organisations. The Trust has negotiated a bank exclusive contract with NHS Professionals (NHSP) . This exclusive contract is essentially for current leavers or recent leavers from the Trust. Successful candidates work as bank staff in this Trust only. This provides another opportunity to enrol more staff as bank only and reduce agency use. The development of the Trust bank allows permanent substantive staff to work extra shifts at a competitive rate; thus ensuring excellent standards are delivered, continuity of patient experience and care and a reduction in the reliance on agency staffing. Whilst we have been doing this we have also been focussing our attention on recruitment and retention to reduce the reliance upon bank and agency staff. Outcome: Achieved Continue to report staffing requirements bi -annually and discuss ad -hoc requirements due to patient acuity with the NHS Professionals . Priority 2: Development of a Neuro Buddy Service Patients with neurological conditions may experience various emotions, including fear, anger or sadness. A group of volunteers have become 'Neuro Buddies' who support both patients and vi sitors across the Trust when they feel most vulnerable. Patients and their carers often say that talking to someone else who has been affected helps them feel less like they are on their own and more confident about coping with the situation they are in - Neuro Buddies offer people a chance to do that. 143 Outcome: Achieved Twenty three Neuro Buddies are currently acting in the capacity of volunteers across the Trust. A case study of a Neuro Buddy was presented to the Patient Experience Group as a patient/volunteer story to highlight the benefits of the service for patients, volunteers and staff. Feedback included: From a Neuro Buddy: \"I have been a patient here and wanted to give something back as I was so grateful for how the Walton Centre helped me. It is such a rewarding role and gives me such an opportunity to help patients, as I know what it feels like to be in their position.\" From a patient: \"This is something over and above what I was expecting when I came into hospital. They made me feel so relaxed and calm.\" From a staff member: \"They have has been fantastic at communicating with patients that have needed emotional support. They are very respectful of the patients' anxieties and worries and have a natural ability to engage.\" Priority 3: Launch 'John's Campaign' for Dementia Johns Campaign is an initiative to welcome and support family members of people with dementia according to patient's needs and not be restricted by visiting hours. Involving a family carer from the moment of admission to hospital until the moment of discharge has been proven to enable the delivery of quality of care and improved outcomes. Outcom e: Achieved The Trust has implemented Johns Campaign and this is championed by the Safeguarding Matron who visits each ward when patients with dementia are admitted to the Trust. 2.2 What are our priorities for 2018 - 2019 In December 2017, the Board of Governors undertook a full review of quality indicators used by the Trust for the previous financial year and acknowledged the work implemented to ensure each indicator was successfully implemented and monitored. After this review, quality priorities were identified and agreed for 2018/19 with the Quality Committee, Healthwatch and Specialist Commissioners identifying the final priorities from those initially identified. 144 How progress to achieve these priorities will be monitored and measured: Each o f the priorities ha ve identified lead/s who have agreed milestones throughout the year . Monthly meetings are held to review progress . How progress to achieve these priorities will be reported: Updates are reported to the Quality Committee and Patient Experience Group which report to Trust Board. Merseyside Internal Audit Agency (MIAA) will be fully involved providing regular reviews and assurance via the Audit Committee. Quarterly quality meetings are held with the commissioners to review quality ass urance and provide external scrutiny and performance management. 2.2.1 Patient Safety Priority 1: Reduce Falls There is a genuine desire to reduce falls to enhance patient experience. Whilst falls can have a physical harm, psychological elements can also be affected. Falls with no harm can affect patient confidence. Reason for Prioritising : Whilst lots of work has been undertaken in respect of falls, a different review and understanding of themes is required. This includes a number of patients with capacity who are at risk of falls but choose to mobilise unassisted. Outcome Required: To have a real -time discussion with patients and staff when a fall has occurred in order to learn lessons and share this with colleagues. Priority 2: Invest in staff training for patients with challenging behaviour Extensive work has been undertaken to support patients with challenging behaviour. Staff have highlighted that they frequently experience abuse, both verbally and physically from patients and their families which is also highlighted in the staff survey. Reason for Prioritising : The Trust believe it is essential to support our patients and staff within the work place and consequently have arranged for enhanced training to be delivered by Advancing Quality Alliance (AQu A). It is envisaged that such support will have a positive impact on staff in improving their experience in being better able to manage difficult situations. 145 Outcome Required: To develop and implement a bespoke training programme for staff from various disciplines who have contact wi th patients w ith challenging behaviour . Priority 3: Reduce missed doses of critical medication year on year The Trust has a list of medicines that are classed as critical that must be given when prescribed to maintain safe and effective care. On occasions critical medicines are omitted for a variety of reasons and in some cases this is avoidable. Reason for Pri oritising: By raising staff awareness of the issue and identifying and addressing specific causes, we can reduce omissions and thereby improve patient safety. Outcome Required: A year on year reduction in missed doses of critical medicines. 2.2.2 Clinical Effectiveness Priority 1: Extend Health and Wellbeing Programme to improve staff resilience and mindfulness As an organisation with Investors in People Gold we are committed to ensuring the psychological wellbeing of our staff. As the pressure within the NHS increases , it is essential that our staff are able to manage accordingly whilst maintaining good health. Reason for Prioritising : Research shows that supporting staff in the work place to achieve excellent health and wellbeing, results in a better staff and patient experience. Outcome Required: Review current health and wellbeing activities and providing opportunities within the workplace and ensure the more difficult to reach areas i.e. ward areas are encompassed. Priority 2: Reduce non -clinical cancelled operations year on year It is the aim of the Trust to reduce non -clinical cancellations year on year. Reason for prioritising: 146 Cancellations have a negative effect on patient experience. Patients coming into hospital may need to make arrangements for support on discharge, make alternative plans for childcare and provide employers with prior notice of absence therefore cancelling o perations can have a significant practical impact on our patients, in addition to the obvious emotional and psychological impact. Several work -streams such as building on our Clinical Utilisation Review (an electronic tool to monitor whether patients are in the right bed at the right time), timely decision -making, monitoring and management of beds and completion of tablet prescribing to take home will all help our aim to reduce our non -clinical cancellation rate for patients. Outcome Required : A reductio n in the non -clinical cancellation rate year on year . Priority 3: Safety Huddle The safety huddles address issues which have occurred over the past 24 hours an d gives an opportunity to raise potential safety issues for the forthcoming 24 hour period , related to patients, visitors and staff. Reason for prioritising: The safety huddles have been in place for over a 6 month period which now offers the opportunity to review issues which have b een raised such as IT systems, e states issues, infection pre vention, s taffing and bed occupancy . It is important to ascertain if there are any themes, where the hot spots may be within the organisation and what are the ways of best practice for sharing learning. Outcome Required: Undertake six monthly reviews of the Safety huddles to determine themes of concerns, ensuring the sharing of best practice and lessons learnt. Produce bi -annual report of themes and present this to the Quality Committee. 2.2.3 Patient Experience Priority 1: Improve how we provide information to patients Patients and families are increasingly using social media as a key source of information to find out about their condition and their care and providing feedback and opinion. Reason for prioritising: 147 Information needs to be easily accessible through various media forms that are appropriate to patient and family requirements and increasing opportunities for feedback. Outcome Required : Development of social media to increase accessibility of patient in formation and opportunities for how patients may provide feedback through social media. Priority 2: Initiate enhanced training on oral hygiene As a specialised centre for neurology and neurosurgery, we care for patients who have various complex conditions. As a result of some of these conditions, many patients require ventilation (sometimes for prolonged periods of time), a tracheostomy and/or ha ve dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) which at times means a patient has to remain nil by mouth for a period of time. These patients are particularly vulnerable to having poor oral hygiene due to changes in secretions, dry mouth and impaired swallow. A s well as this, many of our patients have cognitive and mobility difficulties , meaning it is difficult for them to clean their teeth efficiently. Reason for prioritising: To enhance the standard of mouth care across the Trust which would result in improv ed patient mood, dignity and assist in potentially reducing hospital acquired pneumonia/ventilator associated pneumonia rates that could be associated with poor oral hygiene. Outcome Required: The aim of this priority is to implement the \"Mouth Care Matters\" project in order to enhance the standard of mouth care in the Trust. Priority 3: Improve the way we listen and act on patient, family and carer feedback Patient, family and carer feedback is important to us and it is essential that we triang ulate information received and use all information gathered. Reason for Prioritising : The Patient Experience Team are keen to review ways in which we gather this information to ensure that all patient groups are heard e.g. via the introduction of patient panels. Involving a family member or carer from the moment of admission to hospital until the moment of discharge has been proven in delivering enhanced quality care and improved outcomes. 148 Outcome Required: Develop engagement activities to facilitate meaningful two way communication so that patients, families and carers have a voice in the care and services provided. 2.3 Statements of Assurance from the Board During 2017/18, The Walton Centre provided and/or sub -contracted four relevant health services: neurology neurosurgery pain management rehabilitation The Walton Centre has reviewed all the data available to them on the quality of care in four of these relevant health services. We have interpreted this as services covered by our Quality C ommittee that are monitored by internal and external indicators and not necessarily a formal review. The income generated by the relevant health services reviewed in 2017/18 represents 91.5% of the total income generated from the provision of the relevant health services by The Walton Centre for 2017/18. 2.3.1 Data Quality The data reviewed covers three dimensions of quality - patient safety, clinical effectiveness and patient experience which are all encompassed within the Quality Committee Ter ms of Reference and Trust Board . The Walton Centre takes the following actions to improve data quality: The Trust continues to develop internal data collection systems t o provide assurance to the Quality Committee in relation to the accuracy of data quality. The Trust continuously reviews its internal processes in relation to the measurement and reporting of the quality indicators reported both to the Board and reported externally. This includes reviewing the quality indicators outlined within the Quality Accounts ensuring that there are standard operating procedures and data quality checks within each quality indicator process. 149 Ward to Board nursing quality indicator data has been collated over the last seven years which includes data collection of not only information to support progress against the Quality Accounts but additional nursing metrics to provide internal assurance and allow a clear focus for improving pati ent experience and delivery of quality care. This information supports the Trust in building year on year metrics to show progress against important aspects of the patient journey. 2.3.2 Participation in Clinical Audit and National Confidential Enqu iries During 2017/2018 , 8 national clinical audits and 3 national confidential enquiries covered relevant health services that The Walton Centre provides.

The Walton Centre has not participated in any special reviews or investigations by the CQC during the reporting period. During the year 2017/18 the Trust has developed a process of self -assessments against the CQC regulations. The self -assessment is supported by a governance process which enables oversight of findings and identification of areas for further review and includes a process to escalation exceptions to the Quality Committee. 2.3.9 Trust Data Quality The Walton Centre submitted records during 2017/18 to the Secondary Uses Service (SUS) for inclusion in the Hospital Episode Statistics which are included in the latest published data. The percentage of records in the published data which included the patient's valid NHS Number was: 99.7% for admitted patient care 99.9% for outpatient care The percentage of records in the published data which included the patient's valid General Practitioner Registration Code was: 100% for outpatient care 100% for admitted patient care Note: These results are in relation to the latest available information at the time of publication and relate to the period April 17 to January 18 (SUS data quality dashboard) . 166 The Walton Centre's Information Governance Assessment report overall score for 2017/18 was 85% and was graded green in accordance with the I nformation Governance Toolkit Grading Scheme . Once again the Trust has made significant progress for 2017/18, with the Trust achieving level 2 for 20 requirements and level 3 for the remaining 25 requirements. The Trust has implemented additi onal action plans to make further improvements on this year's score and to further evidence the Trust's commitment to the I nformation Governance (IG) agenda. A review of the evidence and self -assessment scores undertaken by internal audit as part of the m andated 2017 -18 IG audit requirements has provided the Trust with a level of significant assurance for the eighth year in succession . The latest figures from the NHS IC Indicator portal are for 2011/12 and the national readmission rate was 11.45%. The website link is https://indicators.ic.nhs.uk/webview/ The Walton Centre undertook a Payment by Results clinical coding audit during the reporting period. The following table reflects the results of an audit carried out by an accredited internal coder and the error rates reported for this period for diagnoses and treatment coding (clinical coding) were as follows: The Walton Centre Internal Clinical Coding Audit 2017/18 Coding Field Percentage Primary diagnosis 99% Secondary diagnosis 98% Primary procedure 100% Secondary procedure 100% The above results should not be extrapolated further than the actual sample audited. The sample covered 200 sets of clinical records which were randomly selected from across the whole range of activity and meet the level three standards as defined in the Information Governance Toolkit. 2.3.10 Learning f rom Deaths The Department of Health and Social Care published the NHS (Quality Accounts) Amendments Regulations 2017 in July 2017. These add new mandatory disclosure requirements relating to 'Learning from Deaths' to quality accounts from 20 17/18 onwards. 2.3.11.1 During 2017/18 84 of The Walton Centre patients died. This comprised the following number of deaths which occurred in each quarter of that reporting period: 167 25 in the first quarter 21 in the second quarter 20 in the third quarter 18 in the fourth quarter By 31st March 2018 84 case record reviews and 3 investigations have been carried out in relation to 84 of the deaths included in item 2.3.11.1 In 1 case a death was subjected to both a case record review and an investigation. The number of deaths in each quarter for which a case record review or an investigation was carried out was: 0 in the first quarter 0 in the second quarter 1 in the third quarter 2 in the fourth quarter 2.3.11.2 1 representing 1.2% of the patient deaths during the reporting period are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. In relation to each quarter, this consisted of: 0 representing 0% for the first quarter 0 representing 0% for the second quarter 0 representing 0% for the third quarter 1 representing 5.6% for the fourth quarter These numbers have been estimated using the structured judgement review (SJR) methodology. Prior to the National Quality Board report on Learning from Deaths, The Walton Centre had a robust mechanism of mortality review where all deaths were reviewed in detail and reviewed in the mortality review group. Since the NQB report, WCFT have published an updated Mortality Review policy, which encompasses the SJR methodology for the mortality review, but also in cases where there are potential issues highlighted a root cause analysis (RCA) is undertaken. One case was identified where the death was judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient . This was a patient who died from subarachnoid haemorrhage due to an intracranial aneurysm. There were no issues with the in-hospital care but there had been a del ay in treating the aneurysm. This had therefore not taken place when the patient presented with an acute haemorrhage. A full RCA has taken place, and the case has been heard at a Coroner's inquest. The following lessons have been learnt from the review in to this case: 168 1) There was a missed opportunity to treat the patient when they were admitted for an elective procedure to treat the aneurysm but the correct medication was not administered the night before and so the procedure was cancelled. It was then cance lled on subsequent days due to emergency cases. 2) There were then delays in reviewing the patient in clinic, and listing for a repeat procedure and so the fatal haemorrhage occurred before treatment could take place. As a result of this case WCFT have take n immediate measures to ensure that no other vascular patients at high risk are awaiting appointments and that all appropriate clinical actions have taken place. There is an ongoing review of the vascular service to include a full capacity and demand revie w and redesign of patient pathways and processes. There has also been a standard operating procedure implemented for the medication required prior to elective interventional neuroradiology procedures. A standard operating procedure for the medication requi red prior to elective interventional neuroradiology procedures has been implemented. This has been circulated to all wards and as a result the requirements for such procedures are much clearer. Prior to this there was no specific guidance available for the se procedures and as a result there was the potential for confusion with the guidance for open neurosurgical procedures. There have been no further incidents of omitted medication for such cases. Immediately following this case all Consultants involved in the service worked with the management team to identify any patients who were on the waiting list to be seen as a follow up or were awaiting a management decision. All patients identified during this process as being urgent, were seen promptly and appropr iate clinical action taken. A full review of the vascular service has now started but is not yet complete. This will include a full capacity and demand analysis, restructure of the clinics and redesign of the patient pathways. This is due to be complete wi thin 3 months. 0 case record reviews and 1 investigation completed after 31.03.18 which related to deaths which took place before the start of the reporting period 0 representing 0% of the patient deaths before the reporting period are judged to be more likely than not to have been due to problems in the care provided to the patient. This number has been estimated using the process embedded within the Trust including a full health record review of each death and discussion at the respective Divisional Mortality Meetings. 1 representing 1.2% of the patient deaths during 2017/18 are judged to be more likely than not to have b een due to problems in the care provided to the patient. 169 2.3.11 Implementing Clinical Standards for Seven Day Hospital Services The Walton Centre is committed to providing excellent care to our patients at all times. There are robust clinical systems in place to ensure that excellent care is provided out of hours and at weekends as well as weekdays. The Trust has a high level of Consultant input out of hours and at weekends. The Trust has recently approved an enhanced neurosurg ery Consultant on -call arrangement which recognises the need to have on-site Consultant presence at weekends. There are fundamental issues with the application of the 7 day services clinical standards to specialist Trusts , however WCFT agrees with the prin ciple of Consultant input acutely and are making good progress with compliance with this. We demonstrated a considerable improvement in compliance with clinical standard 2 (% of patients assessed by a Consultant within 14 hours of admission) in the last su rvey in September 2017, with an overall rate of 79%. 170 Part 3 Trust Overview of Quality 2017/18 This section of the Quality Account presents an overview of performance in areas not selected as priorities for 2017/18. Presented are q uantitative metrics, specific to aspects of safety, effectiveness and patient experience which are measure d routinely to assure the Trust Board regarding the quality of care provided, having also been shared at a number of assurance committees within the hospital. Patient Safety Indicators Trust Acquired 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 CDiff 9 9 7 MRSA Bacteraemia 1 1 1 Ecoli 14 12 11 Minor and Moderate Falls 30 36 35 Never Events 0 3 2 Clinical Effectiveness Indicators Mortality - Procedure 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 Tumour 13 8 8 Vascular 39 47 37 Cranial Trauma 26 21 21 Spinal 6 3 4 Patient Experience Indicators Patient Experience Questions 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 Were you involved as much as you wanted to be in decisions about your care and treatment? 93% 99% 91% Overall did you feel you were you treated with respect and dignity while you were in the hospital? 98% 100% 98% Were you given enough privacy when discussing your condition or treatment? 93% 97% 93% Did you find someone on the hospital staff to talk to about your worries and fears? 94% 100% 84% 171 3.1 Complaints 3.1.1 Patient Experience and Complaints Handling The Patient Experience Team provides help, advice and support to patients and their families, as well as helping to resolve c oncerns quickly on their behalf. This can be prior to, during or after their visit to the Trust. The Patient Experience Team can be contacted in various ways including telephone, email or in person whilst in the Trust. Where concerns cannot be easily reso lved or are of a more serious nature, the Patient Experience Team are responsible for supporting the patients and their families in managing the complaint. We pride ourselves in working with patients, families and staff throughout the Trust to resolve com plaints in a timely way, explaining our actions and evidencing how services will be improved as a result of a complaint. Our positive approach to managing and resolving complaints was recognised by Rob Behrens, Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman when he visited The Walton Centre in June 2017. We were the first NHS organisation Mr Behrens visited after coming into pos t. He commented \"The Walton Centre's strong commitment to patient experience was particularly evident; the senior leadership, the complaints teams and frontline staff I spoke to were committed to continuous improvement and saw responding to patient feedbac k and complaints as central to this. The Trust had also focused on staff health and wellbeing as they saw a link between mistakes and staff feeling stressed and unable to cope.\" 3.1.2 Trend Analysis and Lessons Learnt Every complaint is investigated an d each complainant receives a detailed response from the Chief Executive. We ensure those responses are open and transparent and provide assurance that where mistakes have been made, those are rectified and lessons learned. Outcomes from complaints are re ported monthly to various committees and meetings within the Trust and to the Executive Team. Any trends are reported to the Patient Experience Group, the Board and Council of Governors. Trends and actions taken are also discussed in detail in the Govern ance and Risk Quarterly report, the monthly divisional governance and risk group meetings and Quality Committee. Examples of lessons learned from complaints during 2017/18 include revision to the rapid discharge pathway, improvements to the patient admini stration system, improvement to the radiology reporting process and personal reflection for teams and individual staff members. 172 3.1.3 Complaints Activity We use feedback from people who have used the complaints process to help us improve our responsiveness and service. Following the restructure of the Patient Experience team in 2016/17, we reviewed our processes, so that we were more accessible to patients and families. We have developed a person centred approach so that complainants are kept involved and updated at each stage of the investigation, with regular contact from members of the Patient Experience Team. Complaints received 01 April 2017 - 31 March 2018 Quarter 1 April-June 17 Quarter 2 July-Sept 17 Quarter 3 Oct- Dec 17 Quarter 4 Jan-Mar 18 Number of complaints received 27 34 41 29 The Trust received 131 complaints during 2017/18 which was slightly less than the 138 complaints received during 2016/17. A key element of the person centred approach is focusing on the individual outcomes patients and families are seeking when they raise concerns. The Patient Experience Team make contact with the patient or family member once a complaint is received to agree the best way of addressing their concerns. This individualised approach has led to many patients or family members wishing to resolve their concerns informally rather than pursuing the formal complaints procedure. In addition to resolving complaints, wher e improvements can be made that are irrelevant to the complaint but noted in the investigation, these too are taken forward. 3.1.4 Duty of Candour The Trust fully acknowledges its duty of candour which supports one of its core values of openness. Inciden ts which fall into the requirements of the regulations for this are identified through the daily scrutiny of the Datix system. Relevant incidents are identified and entered onto a tracker which manages Trust compliance against the Duty of Candour regulatio ns. All patients, or in some circumstances family members, who fall into the duty of candour requirements are offered an apology by the relevant clinician as soon as possible and this is recorded appropriately. The patient or family member receive s a lett er offering an apology which is signed by the Chief Executive. The letter includes an offer to receive a copy of the root cause analysis investigation. 173 3.2 Local Engagement - Quality Account The Quality Account has evolved by actively engaging with stakeholders and using external feedback and opinion combined with thoughts and visions from staff within The Walton Centre. Trust Executives have also participated in discussions with the local he alth economy and sought views on the services provided by the Trust. The Trust has developed strong stakeholder relationships with local Healthwatch organisations, who have conducted numerous engagement events with patients and visitors at our Trust. The Trust has further developed relationships with charities including, The Brain Charity and Headway. The Trust has actively engaged with Governors through a forward planning event on all aspects of quality including choice of indicators for 2018/19. 3.3 Quality Governance A Quality Governance framework was designed as a tool to encourage and support current good practice for quality governance in healthcare organisations. The Trust developed a Quality Governance Strategy to define the combination of structures and processes at and below Board level to lead on Trust -wide quality performance to ensure that required standards are achieved. This now forms part of the Quality and Patient Safety strategy which sets out key priorities and the principles th at the Trust will continue to develop and apply to current and future planned services The Quality and Patient Safety strategy is underpinned by the Trust's work internally to further improve patient safety and quality, and learning from national work su ch as the Francis Report and Berwick Review. The str ategy is built on 5 foundations: 1: Leadership at all levels 2: Culture of continuous learning 3: Patient engagement 4: Build capacity and skills 5: Measurement to predict The strategy is brought to life and kept a live document with interactive Quality Berwick sessions open to all staff. Different elements of its 5 foundations are discussed, building on our leadership at all levels and culture of continuous learning. Significant progress has been made, meeting several elements ahead of schedule including all the Sign up to Safety pledges and completion of the AQUA Advanced Board Quality and Safety action plan. 174 Following our Investors In People inspection in 2017 the Trust has been reaccredited wit h the Gold standard. It is a prestigious award that demonstrates the Trust's commitment to every member of the workforce and its drive to continually improve. The assessor of the inspection stated how impressed he was with how committed Trust staff are to delivering high quality care to all of our patients and that he could see how our staff showcase the Walton Way values in everything they do. He said that he could see that our staff have a sense of pride in working at our hospital and 'a desire to be the best'. This fantastic achievement reflects the hard work of teams across the organisation and the supportive friendly culture that they have created together. Not only does this make The Walton Centre a great place to work but it also contributes to makin g a fantastic and caring environment for our patients to be treated in. Berwick Sessions The Berwick sessions have been popular with staff providing an opportunity to come together in an open and transparent forum with executives, non -executives and sta ff of all disciplines, both clinical and non -clinical to focus on quality, patient safety and staff experience together. The sessions look at what we do well, where we can improve, listening and learning from each other. Examples of feedback from the sessi on include; 'Good to meet people and feel our opinions can be heard ' 'Lots of genuine discussion' 'Enjoyed the inter activeness and sharing opinions/ideas ' 'Good to meet higher members of staff and not feel as daunting when approaching them with issues ' 3.4 Vanguard - The Neuro Network The Neuro Network Vanguard is a partnership of organisations led by The Walton Centre to improve services for patients with long term neurology conditions and spinal problems. It has been operational for two y ears supported by national funding which came to an end in March 2018. The Vanguard work is a collaboration between The Walton Centre, NHS England, Commissioning groups, voluntary organisations and provider hospitals to deliver outstanding, effective, effi cient and replicable neurology and spinal services. All of the nine projects are established, with positive results demonstrated, relating to patient experience, overall efficiencies and clinical outcomes. 175 While the Neuro Network Vanguard has concentrate d its work within the Trusts' existing catchment area, learning has been shared with services outside the catchment area as per the funding stipulations from the New Care Models Team. As part of the evaluation process we are gathering feedback and stories from our patients, their families and carers. They have informed us about the great effect components of the Neuro Network Vanguard are having on their care and quality of life. One patient told us how it gave him a new life line as he no longer felt isol ated and unable to access help when needed. Under the Vanguard Programme the piloting of Telemedicine has been possible. Teleneurology enables clinical consultations to take place remotely using secure video technology. This pilot service aims to enhance the support currently provided by the Walton Centre to our partner organisations by providing greater access and improved response time to specialist Neurological advice. Remote consultations have been undertaken between The Walton Centre and The Countess of Chester Hospital and Southport District General Hospital. Positive feedback has been received from the patient and clinicians involved, although utilisation of the service has been lower than anticipated. Teleneurolog y is now being evaluated as part of the Vanguard Programme to inform its future development plan. 3.5 Social Media (Instagram) On July 5th 2017 The Walton Centre created an Instagram account. Instagram is a social media platform that is photograph and video led, encouraging sharing and liking content. The aim was and is to engage with patients and visitors and potentially give them another channel in which they can interact with The Walton Centre. The account is progressing well with some posts being shared about staff achievements and championing the hospital's charity fundraisers. Staff and fundraisers have been interacting positively with the content and to date the account has 459 followers, which is increasing daily. 3.6 Sky View The Sky View Ceiling System was installed in June 2017 as part of the Trusts initiative in preventing/ minimising delirium within the Intensive Care Unit. 176 Delirium in patients who are in intensive care is a well described phenomenon, the incidence of which varies from 50% in the low dependency patient to 80% in mechanically ventilated patients. This system has been shown to improve sleep patterns thereby reduci ng delirium as well as stress and anxiety levels. As a result the patient experience and outcomes improve by restoring normal sleep patterns. 3.7 Patient Advice Line Following engagement with patients and families the nurse advice line was reintroduced enabling improved access, advice and guidance on their medical condition . Feedback regarding the patient advice line has been positive. One patient who has recently been diagnosed with Motor Neurone's Disease said the advice was invaluable, providing peace of mind and reassurance at times when he needed support. He said: \"Useful? It is out of this world. You speak to Karen (specialist nurse) and it's like I've always known her, she offers immediate support and encouragement. Just as soon as you ring her up a nd she speaks - the panic just goes out of you.\" He also spoke of the co -ordinating role the specialist nurses have between the GP, Consultant Neurologist and other health care professionals such as the occupational therapists. 3.8 Volunteers Following the introduction of the Volunteer Coordinator role in 2016, the volunteer service has continued to grow at the Trust. There are currently 70 volunteers contributing to almost 750 hours per month on average. Volunteers have been providing a valuab le service in roles relating to research, meet and greet, trolley service, befriending, infection prevention and control, administrative duties and assisting the Pain Management Programme. There is extensive support for volunteers and close monitoring of volunteer activity. This was reflected in the M ersey Internal Audit Agency ( MIAA ) audit of the volunteer service conducted during 2017/18. MIAA audited the processes in line with national guidelines and established practice and rated the Trust's volunteer service as 'Significant Assurance'. 3.9 Theatre Scanner iMRI The Walton Centre is the first hospital in the North West to use an in -theatre intra -operative MRI scanner (iMRI) for adult patients. 177 The iMRI system, which has been operational since May thi s year, allows surgeons to visualise more easily the extent and position of the tumour to ensure that as much of the tumour as possible is safely removed during the operation. This has made a difference to complicated cases by either making the surgery mo re in-depth, or allows patients to avoid a second anaesthetic and surgical procedure by allowing further surgery to be done immediately during the same operation. 3.10 Helipad A new \u00a31m helicopter landing pad was opened in July 2017 at Aintree University Hospital, part of the regional major trauma centre along with The Walton Centre. The regional trauma centre receives patients from across Cheshire and Merseyside who need urgent specialist care which isn't necessarily available in their local hospital. Thi s will save vital minutes when transferring trauma and other time critical patients to hospital which ultimately improves chances of survival and reduces the risk of long -term injury. Until this new development, air ambulances had to land on the playing fi elds on Lower Lane, after which a road ambulance was sent to transfer patients to Aintree's Urgent Care and Trauma Centre. This could add up to half an hour to the journey but with the new helipad it will take just a few minutes. 3.11 Health and Work Champion The Royal College of Occupational Therapists and Public Health England (PHE) supported by the Council for Work and Health are carrying out a project in which Occupational Therapists have been recruited and trained to become Health and Work Champions. The y are using peer to peer education training sessions to encourage their NHS colleagues to routinely ask working age adults about their employment aspirations. There is a strong evidence base showing that work is generally good for health and well - being. Being unable to work is linked with reduced health and well -being outcomes. Health care professionals are instrumental in giving patients the skills, belief, ability and confidence to make the adaptations needed to remain in work or return to work. This i s reflected within the clinical experience of working with people whose ability to maintain their work role is compromised and the negative impact this has on social support and routine, self -esteem, identity and quality of life. The Trust has appointed a Health and Work Champion Lead who is one of 40 across England who has delivered sessions to various staff Trust wide. 178 3.12 Launch Bio Bank The Walton cerebro spinal fluid Research Biobank has been established to promote multidisciplinary basic and translational neurology research. The purpose of the Biobank is to collect and store samples and relevant clinical information for current and future neurological research projects. The Biobank received full approval of the Wales REC4 National Research Ethics Service. Clinicians within the North West collaboration actively engage in neurology research to aid diagnosis and predict prognosis in neurological conditions and to gain an increased understanding of the basic biology of these diseases. We have also generated interest from local and national researchers and are expected to start new projects resulting in research collaborations with our clinicians and scienti sts. 3.13 National Guardian The Trust welcomed the National Guardian for the NHS, Dr Henrietta Hughes, in September 2017. Dr Hughes met with the Trust's Freedom to Speak up Guardian to learn more about our 'speaking up' culture and procedures. Dr Hughes sa id: \"It was an absolute delight to meet Julie and staff who had spoken up to Julie, and to meet senior leaders and see how they maintain a transparent culture. I was struck by the passion and enthusiasm for the highest quality of compassionate patient car e from everyone I spoke to. However, I think my abiding impression was that excellent practice was perceived as normal and that makes The Walton Centre truly special.\" 3.14 Robotic Arm In August 2017 The Walton Centre took delivery of a new Renishaw Neuromate Robotic Arm, which had been a full rebuild/ upgrade of an existing frame that was redundant within the Trust. The choice to utilise an existing piece of equipment rather than procure a brand new device resulted in a significantly improved purchas e price, without any impact on quality. The purchase was supported by a private donor appeal and also a charitable donation from the Oakgrove Foundation Trust paid directly to the supplier, which further reduced the Trust purchase price. The robotic system allows for greater precision in minimally invasive surgery compared to more traditional methods and is complementary to the Trust's development of iMRI, which will be used in resections of tumour or in excision of an epilepsy lesion located using stereo electroencephalogram ( EEG ). At the time of purchase this was one of only 6 Renishaw Neuromate Robotic Arms in the country. 179 3.15 Overview of Performance in 2017/18 against National Priorities from the Department of Health's Operating Framework The following table outlines the Trust's performance in relation to the performance indicators as set out in the Department of Health's Operating Framework. 3.16 Overview of Performance in 2017/18 against NHS Outcomes Framework Domain The Department of Health and NHSI identified changes to Quality Account reporting requirements for 2012/13 and subsequent rounds of Quality Accounts, following consideration by the National Quality Board of introducing mandatory reporting against a small, core set of quality indicators. The indicators are based on recommendations by the National Quality Board, are set out overleaf. They align closely with the NHS Outcomes Framework and are all based on data that trusts already report on nationally. If the indicators are applicable to us the intention is that we will be required to report: Performance Indicator 2016/17 Performance 2017/18 Target 2017/18 Performance Incidence of MRSA 1 0 1 Screening all in -patients for MRSA 97% 95% 95.26% Incidence of Clostridium difficile 9 10 7 All Cancers : Maximum wait time of 31 days for second or subsequent treatment: surgery 96.43% 94% 100% All Cancers : 62 days wait for 1st treatment from urgent GP referral to treatment 100% 85% 100% All Cancers : Maximum waiting time of 31 days from diagnosis to first treatment 100% 96% 100% All Cancers : 2 week wait from referral date to date first seen 99.66% 93% 99.62% Maximum time of 18 weeks from point of referral to treatment in aggregate - patients on an incomplete pathway 96.44% 92% 95% Maximum 6 week wait for diagnostic procedures 0.39% <1% 0.06% Certification against compliance with requirements regarding access to health are for people with a learning disability Fully Compliant Fully Compliant 180 Our perfor mance against these indicators The national avera ge A supporting commentary, which may explain variation from the national average and any steps taken o r planned to improve quality. The data within this report is local data that has not been validated nationally. During 2017/18, the Walton Centre provided and/or sub -contracted four relevant health services. These were neurology, neurosurgery, pain management and rehabilitation. 3.17 Indicators The indicators are listed below and a response is provided if they are deemed applicable to the Trust. If the indicators are deemed no t applicable a rationale for this status is provided. 1. Summary Hospital -Level Mortality Indicator (SHMI): Domain 1: Preventin g people from dying prematurely and 2.

Patient reported outcome scores for (i) groin hernia surgery, (ii) varicose vein surgery, (iii) hip replacement surgery, and (iv) knee replacement surgery Domain 3: Helping people to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury NOT APPLICABLE Rationale: The Trust is a neurological trust and does not perform these procedures. 7. Emergency readmissions to hospital within 28 days of discharge: Domain 3: Helping people to recover from episodes of ill health or following injury APPLICABLE Response: No. of readmissions % of Inpatient Discharges 4.6% Change 18 0.3% Calculation of readmission rates is based on the national standard as defined within the Compendium of clinical and Health Indicators. ( https://indicators.ic.nhs.uk/webview/ ). The rates are for patients 16 years and over. Actions to be taken The Walton Centre considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: The Trust recognises that the main causes for readmissions are due to infection and post operative complications. The Walton Centre has taken the following actions to improve this rate, and so the quality of 182 its services, by : Consultant review of all readmissions to ensure any lessons learnt are embedded into future practice. 8.

Within the survey, the percentage of staff who w ould recommend the Trust as a place to work remained similar to 2016 at 78% and the percentage of staff who would recommend the Trust as a place to receive treatment\" increased to 92% from 91% in 2016. Out of the 32 key findings within the 2017 survey, t he Trust had the best score for acute specialist trusts in England in 2 findings. In 25 of the findings the Trust was either better or the same as the national average and in 7 of the key findings the Trust's score was worse than the national average, tho ugh in 3 out of these 7, the Trust had improved their score from the 2016 survey. The Walton Centre considers that this data is as described for the following reasons: In addition to the annual staff survey, a staff Friends and Family Test has also taken place on a quarterly basis this year.

This commentary is informed by our ongoing engagement with the Trust and its patients, the feedback received through our information and signposting service and independent web - based resources (such as www.car eopinion .org.uk), as well as the draft Quality Account that was made available to us prior its publication. Healthwatch Liverpool held a listening event at The Walton Centre on 07/12/2017 where we spoke to 38 patients. Overall, the feedback was very pos itive with 2/3 giving the Trust a 5 star rating. In fact, almost all patients said they received enough information from the Trust regarding appointments or their condition which indicates on the whole they felt communication was good. The patients' main c oncerns were around staffing levels, yet patients seemed understanding of the situation and felt the staff were doing their best under the circumstances. It did not seem to affect their care, and most felt they were respected and treated with dignity. Ther e were however some individual concerns such as letters going out late and lack of communication around appointments, as well as communication problems between a consultant and staff with regards to a patient's pain management. It is encouraging to see th at there has been a reduction of staff turnover which will hopefully be maintained through the welcomed priorities to invest in improving staff health and wellbeing and training to support staff dealing with patients with challenging behaviour, which will benefit both staff and patients. It was especially heartening to see the great feedback from patients and volunteers regarding the Neuro Buddy scheme which evidences the Trust's dedication to the health and emotional wellbeing of their patients. Other exa mples of this are the Sky View ceiling system and the in-theatre intra -operative MRI scanner (iMRI) which Healthwatch Liverpool finds particularly impressive as it showcases the Trust's willingness to invest in innovative and modern facilities and equipme nt to enhance their patients' care, treatment and wellbeing. Healthwatch Liverpool would like to commend the Trust for the implementation of Mouth Care Matters as we feels this again shows their commitment to patient care in areas that may sometimes be ove rlooked. Health watch Liverpool look forward to the further development of the Trust's Teleneurology, as although we do not have any patient feedback yet on how effective this is (although the Trust has had positive feedback from their own consultations) , it is exciting to see that this is being piloted as it makes their services more accessible to those that may struggle to access the Walton Centre due to the nature of their conditions. 189 In the future, it would be beneficial to see some reflection in the quality account of the equality and diversity issues the Trust are trying to address through work they do with charities in the community. It would also be helpful to know whether they are monitoring their patient population and measuring whether their pa tients feel they are getting equal care. Overall, the Trust is clearly striving to continually improve their high quality expert services which we hope they maintain as they have consistently done so in the past. This is reflected in their impressive Car e Quality Commission rating of 'Outstanding'. Healthwatch Liverpool looks forward to further engagement activities with the Trust and its patients in the coming year. 190 The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust Quality Account 2017 - 2018 Healthwatch Sefton welcomes the opportunity to comment on the Trust's draft Quality Account. Healthwatch Sefton was invited and attended the Presentation and Question & Answer session held on Friday 4th May 2018. The draft Quality Account was also circulated to Healthwatch Sefton in a timely manner with an opportunity for members to input into the priorities being set. To note there are a number of areas were final figures are to be updated for the final Quality Account. Healthwatch Sefton would l ike to note that the draft Quality Account is presented in a format that is easy to follow and clearly demonstrates the achievements for the Improvement Priorities for 2017 - 2018: 'How well we have done'. The draft account also clearly sets out what prio rities have been set for 2018 - 2019. Healthwatch Sefton would in particular like to comment on the below achievements: The improved discharge process is a welcomed achievement by Healthwatch Sefton as this is a theme picked up by Healthwatch Sefton across the Trust's that we work with and has also been identified as a National issue. The achievement of a fully trained cohort of Mental Capacity Act Champions who are now available to provide leadership and support to staff and patients. The development of a nursing bank and the benefits this has brought to both staff and patients along with the reduction of the use of agency staff is noted to be a good system to be implemented. The development of 'Neuro Buddy' volunteers who support patie nts and visitors across the Trust. The implementation of 'John's Campaign' championed by safeguarding matron who visits each ward when patients with dementia are admitted to the ward. It is noted that the Trust has participated in an impressive number o f national audits and service evaluations and collaborations with external agencies indicating their commitment to improve. The Vanguard is drawing to a close but staff are looking to build on the experience and have been gathering feedback from patients w ho have informed them of the great effect which components of the Neuro Network Vanguard are having on their care and quality of life. Healthwatch Sefton is impressed with the importance the Trust places on staff wellbeing and morale. During 2017 -2018, t he report highlights the Investors in People (Gold Standard) being reaccredited and also the award for Health@Work Workplace Wellbeing Charter. 191 The Trust continue to place emphasis on their staff wellbeing and safety as can be seen throughout the report with particular reference to Priority 2 - Investing in staff training for patients with challenging behaviour and Priority 3 - The introduction of Safety Huddles to provide staff with the opportunity to share experiences and to address potential safety issues. The Trust has worked to improve patient experience internally including the setting up of patient panels to ensure that all patient groups have a chance to be heard. During the last 12 months, Healthwatch Sefton has held regular monthly stands to gather patient feedback. This resulted in the Trust achieving a Healthwatch Sefton rating of 5* out of 5. A system has been implemented by the Trust so that any concerns or complaints raised via Healthwatch Sefton are immediately reported to the Trust so that they can be dealt with efficiently and effectively. Healthwatch Sefton has continued to work with the Trust to gather patient feedback independently and also attends the Trust's bi -monthly Patient Experience meetings. 192 193 194 195 25th May 2018 The Walton Centre Quality Account 2017/18 NHS England, NHS Liverpool CCG, South Sefton and Southport and Formby CCG wishes to thank The Walton Centre for the opportunity to comment on their Quality Account for 2017/18. NHS England is commi tted to working in partnership with The Walton Centre to provide safe, high quality care and services. The Quality Account accurately reflects the performance for the organisation. The account clearly sets out the outcomes and achievements against priori ty areas and also demonstrates the additional quality achievements of the Trust, including a real focus on patient experience, engagement and innovation. Of particular note are the achievements in the surgical patient pathway that enhance the patient exper ience with same day surgery and improved patient discharge and the introduction of the Neuro buddy initiative which has received positive feedback from patients, staff and volunteers. The priority areas for the coming year have been agreed by stakeholder s and demonstrate a commitment to quality improvement. The account sets out how the priority areas will be monitored within the Trust and the focus on patients and staff is commendable. It would be good to see what additional measures are in place for the clinical effectiveness priorities to allow the Trust to demonstrate the benefits. There is evidence of strong governance processes through the organisation and there is a continued emphasis on data quality to help inform the internal reporting of outcome s from ward to board. There is an open and honest culture of reporting within the Trust. Participation in National and Local audit is clear, with visible actions leading to change in practice and improvements in care. Of note is the commitment to improvin g quality of care through the current clinical studies and the plans for new research studies in the coming year. Infection prevention measures are robust and the trust is proactive in the management of infection prevention. There was one case of MRSA at tributable to the trust during the year and the team have worked with commissioners and Public Health England to address prevention measures. It is encouraging to see the reduction in the number of Ecoli and C.Difficile cases over the last year. The Vang uard programme has demonstrated how the Trust have collaborated across the health economy, although the programme has not yet concluded, improvements are evident including the use of telemedicine which has allowed patients to have greater access and offere d improved response times to Specialist Neurosurgery advice. Commissioners look forward to seeing the impact that the Vanguard has had on patients, staff and the wider health economy once the programme concludes. The Trust has provided high levels of quality assurance throughout 2017/18 through regular quality and performance meetings with Specialised Commissioning and Clinical Commissioning Groups. 196 We look forward to continuing to work in partnership with The Wal ton Centre to further improve quality and experience for patients.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and the NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2017/18. In our opinion the financial statements: give a true and fair view of the financial position of the group and of the Trust as at 31 March 2018 and of the group's expenditure and income and the Trust's expenditure and income for the year then ended; and have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, as interpreted and adapted by the NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2017/2018; and have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the National Health Service Act 2006 . Basis for opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law . Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and the Trust in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Who we are reporting to This report is made solely to the Council of Governors of the Trust, as a body, in accordance with Schedule 10 of the National Health Service Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Trust's Council of Governors those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Tr ust and the Trust's Council of Governors, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. Conclusions relating to going concern We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report to you where: the Accounting Officer's use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not appropriate; or the Accounting Officer has not disclosed in the financial statements any id entified material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the group's or the Trust's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are autho rised for issue. 201 Overview of our audit approach Overall materiality: \u00a32,404,000, which represents 2% of the group's operating expenses; The Group is formed of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust and The Walton Centre Charity. We performed a full scope audit of the Trust and analytical procedures for the charity. The key audit matter identified was contract variations and non -contract activity We have tested, on a sample basis, all of the Trust's material income and expenditure streams, covering 9 7% of the Trust's income and operating expenses, 96 % of the Trust's expenditure and current and non -current assets, 99% of the Trust's total assets and current and non -current liabilities and 95% of the Trust's total liabilities. Key audit matters The graph below depicts the audit risks identified and their relative significance based on the extent of the financial statement impact and the extent of management judgement. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current year and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters in cluded those that had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy; the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. Key Audit Matter - Trust and Group How the matter was addressed in the audit - Trust and Group Risk: Contract variations and non - contract activity Approximately 90% of the group's operating income is for income from patient care activities, which includes \u00a36.4m from block contracts \u00a3105.4m from activity based contracts and \u00a33.4m for non -contract activities. Block and activity based contract variatio ns and non -contract activity income is subject to verification and agreement by the Trust's Our audit work included, but was not restricted to: evaluating the group's accounting policy for recognition of operating income for compliance with the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual 2017/18; gaining an understanding of the Trust's system for accounting for income from contra ct variations and non -contract activity and evaluating the design of the associated controls; agreeing a sample of contract variations and non -contract activity income to supporting evidence and testing that it has been accounted for in accordance with the stated accounting policy The Trust's accounting policy on operating income is shown in note 1.4 to the financial statements and related disclosures are included in notes 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3. Contract variations and non-contract activity High Potential financial statement impact Low Low Extent of management judgement High Management override of control Valuation of land and buildings Employee remuneration Operating expenses 202 Key Audit Matter - Trust and Group How the matter was addressed in the audit - Trust and Group commissioners. We therefore identified the occurrence and accuracy of income from contract variations and non -contract activity as a significant risk, which was on e of the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement. The Audit Committee identified recognition of income from patient care activities as a significant issue in its report on page 88, where the Audit Committee also described the action that it has taken to address this issue . Key observations We obtained sufficient audit evidence to conclude that: the group's accountin g policy for recognition of operating income complies with the DHSC Group Accounting Manual 2017/18 and has been properly applied; and income from NHS contract variations and non -contract activity in relation to patient care activities is not materially mi sstated. Our application of materiality We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced . We use materiality in determining the nature, timing and extent of our audit work and in evaluating the results of that work. Materiality was determined as follows: Materiality Measure Group Trust Financial statements as a whole \u00a32,404,000 which is 2 % of the group's operating expenses. This benchmark is considered the most appropriate because we consider users of the financial statements to be most interested in how it has expended its revenue and other funding.. Materiality for the current year is a t the same percentage level of gross operating expenses as we determined for the year ended 31 March 2017 as we did not identify any significant changes in the group or the environment in which it operates. \u00a32,391,000 which is 2% of the Trust's operating expenses. This benchmark is considered the most appropriate because we consider users of the financial statements to be most interested in how it has expended its revenue and other funding. Materiality for the current year is at the same percentage level of gross operating expenses as we determined for the year ended 31 March 2017 as we did not identify any significant changes in the Trust or the environment in which it operates. Performance materiality used to drive the extent of our testing 75% of financial statement materiality 75% of financial statement materiality Specific materiality Disclosure of senior managers' remuneration in the Remuneration Report: \u00a321,200, based on 2% of the total senior managers' remuneration. This is due to public int erest in these disclosures and the statutory requirement for them to be made. Communication of misstatements to the Audit Committee \u00a3120,000 and misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds. \u00a3120,000 and misstatements below that threshold that, in our view, warrant reporting on qualitative grounds. The graph below illustrates how performance materiality interacts with our overall materiality and the tolerance for potential uncorrected misstatements. 203 An overview of the scope of our audit Our audit approach was a risk -based approach founded on a thorough understanding of the group's business, its environment and risk profile. In particular our work included: Evaluation by the group audit team of id entified components to assess the significance of each component and to determine the planned audit response based on a measure of materiality and significance of the component as a percentage of the group's operating expenses. A full scope, targeted or an alytical approach was applied for each component based on the relative materiality to the group and our assessment of audit risk; Gaining an understanding of and evaluating the Trust's internal controls environment including its financial and IT systems an d controls; Full scope audit procedures on The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust which represents 99.8% of the group's income, 99.7% of the group's expenditure and 98.8% of its total assets; Analytical procedures on the Walton Centre Charity; Testing, o n a sample basis of all of the Trust's material income and expenditure streams, covering 97% of the Trust's income and operating expenses, 96 % of the Trust's expenditure and current and non - current assets, 99% of the Trust's total assets and current and n on-current liabilities and 95% of the Trust's total liabilities. Other information The Accounting Officer is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Annual Report other than the financial stat ements and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge of the group an d Trust obtained in the course of our work including that gained through work in relation to the Trust's arrangements for securing value for money through economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of its resources or otherwise appears to be material ly misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. In this context, we also have nothing to report in regard to our r esponsibility to specifically address the following items in the other information and to report as uncorrected material misstatements of the other information where we conclude that those items meet the following conditions: Fair, balanced and understand able set out on page 9 in accordance with provision C.1.1 of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance - the statement given by the directors that they consider the 25% 75% Overall materiality - group Tolerance Performance materiality 25% 75% Overall materiality - Trust 204 Annual Report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for patients, regulators and other stakeholders to assess the group and Trust's performance, business model and strategy, is materially inconsistent with our knowledge of the Trust obtained in the audit ; or The Audit Committee reporting set out on page 86 in accordance with provision C.3.9 of the NHS Foundation Trust Code of Governance - the section describing the work of the Audit committee does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to th e Audit committee. Other information we are required to report on by exception under the Code of Audit Practice Under the Code of Audit Practice published by the National Audit Office on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General (the Code of Audit Pra ctice) we are required to consider whether the Annual Governance Statement does not meet the disclosure requirements set out in the NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2017/18. We are not required to consider whether the Annual Governance Statemen t addresses all risks and controls or that risks are satisfactorily addressed by internal controls. We have nothing to report in this regard. Our opinion on other matters required by the Code of Audit Practice is unmodified In our opinion : the parts of the Remuneration Report and the Staff Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, as interpreted and adapted by the NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2017/18 and the re quirements of the National Health Service Act 2006; and based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit of the financial statements and our knowledge of the Trust gained through our work in relation to the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources the other information published together with the financial statements in the Annual Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statem ents. Matters on which we are required to report by exception Under the Code of Audit Practice we are required to report to you if: we have reported a matter in the public interest under Schedule 10 (3) of the National Health Service Act 2006 in the course of, or at the conclusion of the audit; or we have referred a matter to the regulator under Schedule 10 (6) of the National Health Service Act 2006 because we had reason to believe that the Trust, or a director or officer of the Trust, was about to make, or had made, a decision which involved or would involve the incurring of expenditure that was unlawful, or was about to take, or had taken a course of action which, if followed to its conclusion, would be unlawful and likely to cause a loss or deficie ncy. We have nothing to report in respect of the above matters . Responsibilities of the Accounting Officer and Those Charged with Governance for the financial statements As explained more fully in the Statement of Accounting Officer's responsibilities, set out on pages 99 to 100 the Chief Executive, as Accounting Officer, is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in the form and on the basis set out in the Accounts Directions included in the NHS foundation trust annual reporting manu al 2017/18, for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the Accounting Officer determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Accounting Officer is responsible for assessing the group's and the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the group or the Trust lacks funding for its continued existence or when policy decisions have been made that affect the services provided by the group or the Trust . The Audit Committee is Those Charged with Governance. 205 Auditor's respon sibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report th at includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error a nd are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities . This description forms part of our auditor's report. Report on other legal and regulatory requirements - Conclusion on the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources Matter on which we are required to report by exception - Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources Under the Code of Audit Practice we are required to report to you if, in our opinion we have not been able to satisfy ourselves that the Trust has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficienc y and effectiveness in its use of resources for the year ended 31 March 2018. We have nothing to report in respect of the above matter . Responsibilities of the Accounting Officer The Accounting Officer is responsible for putting in place proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the use of the Trust's resources. Auditor's responsibilities for the review of the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources We are req uired under paragraph 1 of Schedule 10 of the National Health Service Act 2006 to be satisfied that the Trust has made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources and to report where we have not been able to satisfy ourselves that it has done so. We are not required to consider, nor have we considered, whether all aspects of the Trust's arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources are operating effectively. We have undertaken our review in accordance with the Code of Audit Practice , having regard to the guidance on the specified criterion issued by the Comptroller and Auditor General in November 2017, as to whether in all significant respects, the Trust had p roper arrangements to ensure it took properly informed decisions and deployed resources to achieve planned and sustainable outcomes for taxpayers and local people. The Comptroller and Auditor General determined this criterion as that necessary for us to co nsider under the Code of Audit Practice in satisfying ourselves whether the Trust put in place proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources for the year ended 31 March 2018, and to report by exception where we are not satisfied. We planned our work in accordance with the Code of Audit Practice. Based on our risk assessment, we undertook such work as we considered necessary to be satisfied that the Trust has put in place proper arrangements for securing econo my, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of resources. 206 Report on other legal and regulatory requirements - Certificate We certify that we have completed the audit of the financial statements of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust in accordance with the requirements of Chapter 5 of Part 2 of the National Health Service Act 2006 and the Code of Audit Practice.

Notes to the Accounts Accounting Policies NHS Improvement, in exercising the statutory functions conferred on Monitor, has directed that the financial statements of the Trust shall meet the accounting requirements of the Department of Health and Social Care Group Accounting Manual (GAM), which shall be agreed with HM Treasury. Consequently, the following financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the GAM 2017/18 issued by the Department of Health and Social Care. The accounting policies contained in the GAM follow International Financial Reporting Standards to the extent that they are meaningful and appropriate to the NHS, as determined by HM Treasury, which is advised by the Financial Reporting Advisory Boa rd. Where the GAM permits a choice of accounting policy, the accounting policy that is judged to be most appropriate to the particular circumstances of the Trust for the purpose of giving a true and fair view has been selected. The particular policies adop ted are described below. These have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to accounts. 1.1 Accounting Convention These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to account for the revaluation of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, inventories and certain financial assets and financial liabilities. 1.2 Going Concern Following extensive enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Trust has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. They have identified no material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on the Trust's ability to continue as a going concern. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts. The main factors in reaching this conclusion were: The Trust's latest two -year plan (2017/18 - 2018/19) forecasts a surplus position across the period. A refresh of the 2018/19 plan is being undertaken to update financial assumptions made in the two -year plan as well as rebasing activity, income and expenditure positions; Projected cash balances are sufficient to sustain the investment programme and meet short term operating costs. The Trust has sufficient cash he adroom to support its plans; There is no expectation for short -term loans or overdraft facilities; Internal auditor's opinions have provided assurance as to the accuracy and reliability of the Trust's financial systems and the robustness of the internal co ntrols. 1.3 Consolidation The Walton Centre Charity The Trust is the corporate trustee to The Walton Centre Charity (the Charity). The Trust has assessed its relationship to the Charity and determined it to be a subsidiary because the Trust is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns and other benefit s for itself, patients and staff from its involvement with the Charity and has the ability to affect those returns and other benefits through its power over the Charity. The Charity's statutory accounts are prepared to 31 March in accordance with the UK Charities Statement of Recommended Practice (SORP) which is based on UK Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 102. On consolidation, necessary adjustments are made to the Charity's assets, liabilities and transactions to: 214 Recognise and measure them in accorda nce with the Trust's accounting policies; and Eliminate intra -group transactions, balances, gains and losses. Associates Associate entities are those over which the Trust has the power to exercise a significant influence so as to obtain economic or other benefits. Associate entities are recognised in the Trust's financial statements using the equity method. The investment is initially recognised at cost. It is increased or decreased subsequently to reflect the Trust's share of the entity's profit or loss o r other gains and losses following acquisition. It is also reduced when any distributions are received by the Trust from the associate. Associates which are classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 1.4 Income The main source of revenue for the Trust is from NHS England (via the North West Specialised Commissioning Hub) for specialist treatment, Liverpool Clinical Commissioning Group for non -specialist services (as contract lead for the majority of non -specialis t CCG activity), Welsh Assembly for patients from Wales and from the Isle of Man, which are government funded commissioners of NHS health and patient care. Income in respect of services provided is recognised when, and to the extent that, performance occ urs and is measured at the fair value of the consideration receivable. At the year end, the Trust accrues income relating to activity delivered in that year. Where a patient care spell is incomplete at the year end, revenue relating to the partially comple te spell is accrued and agreed with the commissioner. Where income is received for a specific activity which is to be delivered in a subsequent financial year, that income is deferred. The Trust receives income under the NHS Injury Cost Recovery Scheme, designed to reclaim the cost of treating injured individuals to whom personal injury compensation has subsequently been paid, for instance by an insurer. The Trust recognises the income when it receives notification from the Department of Work and Pension 's Compensation Recovery Unit that the individual has lodged a compensation claim. The income is measured at the agreed tariff for the treatments provided to the injured individual, less a provision for unsuccessful compensation claims and doubtful debts. Income from the sale of non -current assets is recognised only when all material conditions of sale have been met and is measured as the sums due under the sale contract. Interest revenue is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstandi ng and interest rate applicable. 1.5 Expenditure on Employee Benefits Short -term employee benefits Salaries, wages and employment -related payments such as social security costs and the apprenticeship levy are recognised in the period in which the servic e is received from employees. The cost of annual leave entitlement earned but not taken by employees at the end of the period is recognised in the financial statements to the extent that the employees are permitted to carry forward leave into the following period where it is deemed to be material. 215 Pension costs Past and present employees are covered by the provisions of the NHS Pensions Scheme (the Scheme). The Scheme is an unfunded, defined benefit scheme that covers NHS employers, General Practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State, in England and Wales. It is not possible for the Trust to identify its share of the underlying Scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, the Scheme is accounted for as a defined contribut ion scheme. The cost to the Trust of participating in the Scheme is equal to the contributions payable to the Scheme for the accounting period. Employer's pension cost contributions are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income as and when they become due. Additional pension liabilities arising from early retirements are not funded by the Scheme except where the retirement is due to ill -health. The full amount of the liability for the additional costs is charged to the operating expenses at the time the Trust commits itself to the retirement, regardless of the method of payment. 1.6 Expenditure on Other Goods and Services Expenditure on goods and services is recognised when, and to the extent that, they have been received and is measured at the fair value of those goods and services. Expenditure is recognised in operating expenses except where it results in the creation of a non -current asset such as property, plant and equipment. 1.7 Property, Plant and Equipment Capitalisation Property, plant and equipment is capitalised where: It is held for use in delivering services or for administrative purposes; It is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the Trust; It is expected to be used for mor e than one financial year; and The cost of the item can be measured reliably. The asset must: Individually have a cost of at least \u00a35,000; or Collectively have a cost of at least \u00a35,000 and individually have a cost of more than \u00a3250, where the assets are functionally interdependent, have broadly simultaneous purchase dates, are anticipated to have similar disposal dates and are under single managerial control; or Form part of the initial equipping and setting -up cost of a new building, ward or unit irrespective of their individual or collective cost. Valuation All property, plant and equipment assets are measured initially at cost, representing the costs directly attributable to acquiring or constructing the asset and bringing it to the location and co ndition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Land and buildings used for the Trust's services or for administrative purposes are measured subsequently at fair value. Revaluations are performed with sufficient regularity to ensure that carrying amounts are not materially different from those that would be determined at the Statement of Financial Position date. Fair values are based on modern equivalent assets basis for existing use on an alternative site valuati on. 216 The freehold properties of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust were valued as at 31 March 2018 by an external valuer, Gerald Eve LLP, a regulated firm of Chartered Surveyors. The valuation was prepared in accordance with the requirements of the RICS Valuation - Global Standard 2017 and the notional standards and guidance set out in RICS Valuation - Professional Standards UK January 2014 (revised 2015), the International Valuation Standards, and IFRS as adapted and interpreted by the Financial Rep orting Manual (FReM). The valuations of specialised properties were derived using the Depreciated Replacement Cost (DRC) method, with other in -use properties reported on an Existing Use Value basis. Properties in the course of construction for service or administration purposes are carried at cost, less any impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees but not borrowing costs, which are recognised as expenses immediately, as allowed by IAS 23 for assets held at fair value. Assets are revalued and depre ciation commences when they are brought into use. An item of property, plant and equipment which is surplus with no plan to bring it back into use is valued at fair value under IFRS 13, if it does not meet the requirements of IAS 40 or IFRS 5. Subsequent expenditure Subsequent expenditure relating to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an increase in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that additional future economic benefits or service potential deriving from the cost incurred to replace a component of such item will flow to the enterprise and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Where a component of an asset is replaced, the cost of the replacement is capitalised if it meets the criteria for recognition above. The carrying amount of the part replaced is de -recognised. Other expenditure that does not generate additional future economic benefits or service potential, such as repairs and maintenance is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which it is incurred. Depreciation Items of property, plant and equipment are depreciated over their remaining useful economic lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. Freehold land is consider ed to have an infinite life and is not depreciated. Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until the assets are brought into use. The estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed each year -end, with the effect of any changes re cognised on a prospective basis. Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their estimated useful lives or, where shorter, the lease term. Property, plant and equipment which has been reclassified as 'held for sale' ceases to be depreciated upon the reclassification. Revaluation gains and losses Revaluation gains are taken to the revaluation reserve except where, and to the extent that, they reverse a revaluation decrease for the same asset previously recognised in the Statement of Comprehensiv e Income, in which case it is credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. A revaluation loss is charged to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a balance on the reserve for the asset and, thereafter, is charged to the Statement of Com prehensive Income. Gains and losses recognised in the revaluation reserve are reported in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as an item of 'other comprehensive income.' Impairments At each Statement of Financial Position date, the Trust reviews its t angible and intangible non-current assets to determine whether there is an indication that any have suffered impairment due to a loss of economic benefits or service potential. If there is an indication of 217 an impairment loss, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to determine whether there has been a loss and, if so, its amount. In accordance with the GAM, impairments that arise from a clear consumption of economic benefits or of service potential in the asset are charged to operating expenses. A compensating transfer is made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve of an amount equal to the lower of (i) the impairment charged to operating expenses; and (ii) the balance in the revaluation reserve attributable to that as set before the impairment. An impairment that arises from a clear consumption of economic benefits or of service potential is reversed when, and to the extent that, the circumstances that gave rise to the loss is reversed. Reversals are recognised in ope rating expenses to the extent that the asset is restored to the carrying amount it would have had if the impairment had never been recognised. Any remaining reversal is recognised in the revaluation reserve. Where, at the time of the original impairment, a transfer was made from the revaluation reserve to the income and expenditure reserve, an amount is transferred back to the revaluation reserve when the impairment reversal is recognised. Other impairments are treated as revaluation losses. Reversals of 'o ther impairments' are treated as revaluation gains. Donated, government grant and other grant funded assets Donated and grant funded property, plant and equipment assets are capitalised at their fair value on receipt. The donation/grant is credited to the Statement of Comprehensive Income at the same time, unless the donor has imposed a condition that the future economic benefits embodied in the grant are to be consumed in a manner specified by the donor, in which case, the donation/grant is deferred within liabilities and is carried forward to future financial years to the extent that the condition has not yet b een met. The donated and grant funded assets are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other items of property, plant and equipment. 1.8 Intangible Assets Intangible assets are non -monetary assets without physical substance which are capable of being sold separately from the rest of the Trust's business or which arise from contractual or other legal rights. They are recognised only where it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to, or service potential be provided to, the Trust and where the cost of the asset can be measured reliably. Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred and is not capitalised. Intangible assets are capitalised when they have a cost of at least \u00a35,000. Expenditure on development is capitalised only where all of the following can be demonstrated: The project is technically feasible to the point of completion and will result in an intangible asset for sale or use; The Trust intends to complete the intangible asset and sell or use it; The Trust has the abil ity to sell or use the intangible asset; How the intangible asset will generate probable future economic or service delivery benefits, e.g. the presence of a market for it or its output, or where it is to be used for internal use, the usefulness of the as set; Adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to the Trust to complete the development and sell or use the asset; The Trust can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. 218 Software which is integral to the operation of hardware, e.g. an operating system, is capitalised as part of the relevant item of property, plant and equipment. Software which is not integral to the operation of hardware, e.g. application software, is capitalised as an intangible asset. Intangible assets are recognised initially at cost, comprising all directly attributable costs needed to create, produce and prepare the asset to the point that it is capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Subsequently intangible assets are measured at current value in existing use. Where no active market exists, intangible assets are valued at the lower of amortised replacement cost (modern equivalent asset basis) and the value in use where the asset is inc ome generating. Revaluation gains and losses and impairments are treated in the same manner as for property, plant and equipment. An intangible asset which is surplus with no plan to bring it back into use is valued at fair value under IFRS 13, if it does not meet the requirements of IAS 40 or IFRS 5. Internally -developed software is held at historic cost to reflect the opposite effects of development costs and technological advances. Intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually. Intangible assets are amortised over their expected useful economic lives in a manner consistent with the consumption of economic or service delivery benefits. 1.9 Revenue G overnment and Other Grants Government grants are grants from government bodies other than income from commissioners or NHS Trusts for the provision of services. Where a grant is used to fund revenue expenditure it is taken to the Statement of Comprehensive Income to match that expenditure. The value of the benefit received when accessing funds from the Government's apprenticeship service is recognised as income at the point of receipt of the training service. Where these funds are paid directly to an accr edited training provider, the corresponding notional expense is also recognised at the point of recognition for the benefit. 1.10 Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the first -in, first -out cost formula. This is considered to be a reasonable approximation to fair value due to the high turnover of stocks. 1.11 Financial Instruments and Financia l Liabilities Recognition and de -recognition Financial assets and financial liabilities which arise from contracts for the purchase or sale of non-financial items (such as goods or services), which are entered into in accordance with the Trust's normal pu rchase, sale or usage requirements, are recognised when, and to the extent which, performance occurs (i.e. when receipt or delivery of the goods or services is made). Financial assets are de -recognised when the contractual rights to receive cash flows fro m the assets have expired or the Trust has transferred substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership. Financial liabilities are de -recognised when the obligation has been discharged, cancelled or expires. 219 Classification and measurement Financial assets are categorised as: 'At fair value through income and expenditure'; financial assets; 'Loans to maturity' investments. 'Loans and receivables' is the only category relevant to the Trust. Th e Charity investments are 'available for sale.' Financial liabilities are classified as: 'Fair value through income and expenditure'; or 'Other financial liabilities.' All of the Trust's financial liabilities are categorised as 'other financial liabilit ies.' The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition. Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non -derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payment s which are not quoted in an active market. They are included in current assets. The Trust's loans and receivables comprise: Current investments; Cash and cash equivalents; NHS receivables; Accrued income; and Other receivables. Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are measured subsequently at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts exactly estimated future ca sh receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. Interest on loans and receivables is calculated using the effective interest method and credited to th e Statement of Comprehensive Income. Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities are recognised in the Statement of Financial Position when the Trust becomes party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument or, in the case of trade payables, when the goods or services have been received. Financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred, and measured subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts exactly estimated future c ash payments through the expected life of the financial liability or, when appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount of the financial liability. They are included in current liabilities except for amounts payable more than 12 months after the Statement of Financial Position date, which are classified as long -term liabilities. Interest on financial liabilities carried at amortised cost is calculated using the effective interest method and charged to finance costs. 220 Impairment of financial a ssets At the Statement of Financial Position date, the Trust assesses whether any financial assets, other than those held at 'fair value through income and expenditure' are impaired. Financial assets are impaired and impairment losses are recognised if, an d only if, there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events which occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and which has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of the revised future cash flows discounted at the asset's original effective interest rate. The loss is recognised in expenditure. If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through expe nditure to the extent that the carrying amount of the receivable at the date of the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised. 1.12 Leases Finance leases Where substantially all risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset are borne by the Trust, the asset is recorded as property, plant and equipment and a corresponding liability is recorded. The value at which both are recognised is the lower of the fair value of the asset or the present value of the minimum lease payments, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The asset and liability are recognised at the commencement of the lease. Thereafter the asset is accounted for as an item of property plant and equipment. The annual rental is split between the repayment of the liability and a finance cost so as to achie ve a constant rate of finance over the life of the lease. The annual finance cost is charged to Finance Costs in the Statement of Comprehensive Income. The lease liability is de-recognised when the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires. Operating leases Other leases are regarded as operating leases and the rentals are charged to operating expenses on a straight -line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease incentives received are added to the lease rentals and charged to operating expenses over the life of the lease. 1.13 Provisions The Trust recognises a provision where it has a present legal or constructive obligation of uncertain timing or amount; for which it is probable that there will be a future outflow of cash or other resources; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount. The amount recog nised in the Statement of Financial Position is the best estimate of the resources required to settle the obligation. Where the effect of the time value of money is significant, the estimated risk -adjusted cash flows are discounted using the discount rates published and mandated by HM Treasury. Clinical negligence costs NHS Resolution operates a risk pooling scheme under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution, which, in return, settles all clinical negligence claims. The contribut ion is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income. Although NHS 221 Resolution is administratively responsible for all clinical negligence cases the legal liability remains with the Trust. The total value of clinical negligence provisions carried by NHS Resolution on behalf of the Trust is disclosed in Note 18 but is not recognised in the Trust's accounts. The excess on these claims payable by the Trust is included in the accounts and disclosed in Note 18 as 'other legal claims.' Non-clinical risk pooling The Trust participates in the Property Expenses Scheme and the Liabilities to Third Parties Scheme. Both are risk pooling schemes under which the Trust pays an annual contribution to NHS Resolution and, in return, receives assist ance with the costs of claims arising. The annual membership contributions, and any 'excesses' payable in respect of particular claims are charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when the liability arises. 1.14 Contingencies Contingent assets (that is, assets arising from past events whose existence will only be confirmed by one or more future events not wholly within the entity's control) are not recognised as assets, but are disclosed in Note 20 where an inflow of economic b enefits is probable. Contingent liabilities are not recognised, but are disclosed in Note 20, unless the probability of a transfer of economic benefits is remote. Contingent liabilities are defined as: Possible obligations arising from past events whos e existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the entity's control; or Present obligations arising from past events but for which it is not probable that transfer of economic benefits will ar ise or for which the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. 1.15 Public Dividend Capital Public dividend capital (PDC) is a type of public sector equity finance based on the excess of assets over liabilities at the tim e of the establishment of the predecessor NHS Trust. HM Treasury has determined that, being issued under statutory authority rather than under contract, PDC is not a financial instrument within the meaning of IAS 32. A charge, reflecting the forecast cost of capital utilised by the Trust, is paid over as public dividend capital dividend. The charge is calculated at the real rate set by HM Treasury (currently 3.5%) on the average relevant net assets of the Trust during the financial year. Relevant net asset s are calculated as the value of all assets less the value of all liabilities, except for: Donated assets (including lottery funded assets); Average daily cash balances held with the Government Banking Services (GBS) and National Loans Fund (NLF) deposits, excluding cash balances held in GBS accounts that relate to a short -term working capital facility; Any PDC dividend balance receivable or p ayable; and Any STF incentive and STF bonus fund receivable. In accordance with the requirements laid down by the Department of Health and Social Care (as the issuer of PDC), the dividend for the year is calculated on the actual average relevant net assets as set out in the 'pre -audit' version of the annual accounts. The dividend thus calculated is not revised should any adjustment to net assets occur as a result the audit of the annual accounts. 222 1.16 Value Added Tax Most of the activities of the T rust are outside the scope of VAT and, in general, output tax does not apply and input tax on purchases is not recoverable. Irrecoverable VAT is charged to the relevant expenditure category or included in the capitalised purchase cost of fixed assets. Wher e output tax is charged or input VAT is recoverable, the amounts are stated net of VAT. 1.17 Corporation Tax HM Treasury has decided to defer the planned implementation of legislation requiring NHS Foundation Trusts to pay corporation tax on profits gen erated on their commercial activities. As a result, NHS Foundation Trusts will not become taxable on their profits. This may change with future Government legislation. 1.18 Foreign Currencies The Trust operates and accounts for its transactions in sterling. Transactions denominated in a foreign currency are translated into sterling at the spot exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Resulting exchange gains and losses are taken to the Sta tement of Comprehensive Income. At the Statement of Financial Position date, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the Statement of Financial Position date. 1.19 Third Party Assets Assets belonging to third parties (such as money held on behalf of patients) are not recognised in the accounts since the Trust has no beneficial interest in them. Details of third party assets are given in Note 26 to the accounts. 1.20 Losses and Special Payments Losses and Special Payments are items that Parliament would not have contemplated when it agreed funds for the health service or passed legislation. By their nature they are items that ideally should not arise. They are therefore subject to special control procedures compared with the generality of payments. They are divided into different categories, which govern the way each individual case is handled. Losses and Special Payments are charged to the relevant functional headings in the Statement of Compre hensive Income on an accruals basis, including losses which would have been made good through insurance cover had NHS Trusts not been bearing their own risks (with insurance premiums then being included as normal revenue expenditure). Note 28 on Losses a nd Special Payments is compiled directly from the losses and compensations register which is prepared on a cash basis. 1.21 Critical Accounting Judgements and Key Sources of Estimation In the application of the Trust's accounting policies, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors tha t are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from those estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are continually reviewed. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revis ion affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Critical judgements in applying accounting policies In the process of applying the Trust's accounting policies, management has not been required to make any judgements, apart from those involving estimations, which has had a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. 223 Key sour ces of estimation uncertainty The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the Statement of Financial Position date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the ca rrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year. Valuation and impairment of non -financial assets - the Trust assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non -financial assets at each reporting date. The key area of uncertainty relates to the Trust's valuation of its land and buildings. Further details are provided in Note 11. The land and buildings were valued by Gerald Eve LLP as at 31 March 2018. 1.22 Operating Segments The Trust is the UK's only specialist neurological centre and sees patients with neurological associated conditions referred from all over the country. Contracts for services are negotiated with commissioners and monitored on the basis of point of delivery, inpatients, outpatients etc. The ser vices provided by the Trust are interdependent and therefore the Board considers that the Trust operates as a single segment. 1.23 Accounting standards that have been issued but have not yet been adopted The DH GAM does not require the following Standards and Interpretations to be applied in 2017/18. These standards are still subject to HM Treasury FReM adoption, with IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 being for implementation in 2018/19, and the government implementation date for IFRS 16 and IFRS 17 still subject to HM T reasury consideration. IFRS 9 Financial Instruments - application required for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, but not yet adopted by the FReM: early adoption is not therefore permitted. IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers - application required for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, but not yet adopted by the FReM: early adoption is not therefore permitted. IFRS 16 Leases - application required for accounti ng periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019, but not yet adopted by the FReM: early adoption is not therefore permitted.

Details of the benefits payable and rules of the Schemes can be found on the NHS Pensions website at www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/pensions . Both are unfunded defined benefit schemes that cover NHS employers, GP practices and other bodies, allowed under the direction of the Secretary of State in England and Wales. They are no t designed to be run in a way that would enable NHS bodies to identify their share of the underlying scheme assets and liabilities. Therefore, each scheme is accounted for as if it were a defined contribution scheme: the cost to the NHS body of participati ng in each scheme is taken as equal to the contributions payable to that scheme for the accounting period. In order that the defined benefit obligations recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from those that would be determined at the reporting date by a formal actuarial valuation, the FReM requires that \"the period between formal valuations shall be four years, with approximate assessments in intervening years\". An outline of these follows: a) Accounting valuation A valuation of scheme liability is carried out annually by the scheme actuary (currently the Government Actuary's Department) as at the end of the reporting period. This utilises an actuarial assessment for the previous accounting period in conjunction wit h updated membership and financial data for the current reporting period, and is accepted as providing suitably robust figures for financial reporting purposes. The valuation of the scheme liability as at 31 March 2018, is based on valuation data as 31 Mar ch 2017, updated to 31 March 2018 with summary global member and accounting data. In undertaking this actuarial assessment, the methodology prescribed in IAS 19, relevant FReM interpretations, and the discount rate prescribed by HM Treasury have also been used. The latest assessment of the liabilities of the scheme is contained in the report of the scheme actuary, which forms part of the annual NHS Pension Scheme Accounts. These accounts can be viewed on the NHS Pensions website and are published annually. Copies can also be obtained from The Stationery Office. 230 b) Full actuarial (funding) valuation The purpose of this valuation is to assess the level of liability in respect of the benefits due under the schemes (taking into account recent demographic expe rience), and to recommend contribution rates payable by employees and employers. The last published actuarial valuation undertaken for the NHS Pension Scheme was completed for the year ending 31 March 2012. The Scheme Regulations allow for the level of contribution rates to be changed by the Secretary of State for Health, with the consent of HM Treasury, and consideration of the advice of the Scheme Actuary and employee and employer representatives as deemed appropriate. The next actuarial valuation is to be carried out as at 31 March 2016 and is currently being prepared. The direction assumptions are published by HM Treasury which are used to complete the valuation calculations, from which the final valuation report can be signed off by the scheme actu ary. This will set the employer contribution rate payable from April 2019 and will consider the cost of the Scheme relative to the employer cost cap. There are provisions in the Public Service Pension Act 2013 to adjust member benefits or contribution rates if the cost of the Scheme changes by more than 2% of pay. Subject to this 'employer cost cap' assessment, any required revisions to member benefits or contribution rates will be determined by the Secretary of State for Health after consultation with the relevant stakeholders.

Note 22 Capital Commitments At 31 March 2018 the Trust had capital commitments of \u00a3280,572 (31 March 2017: \u00a31,228,784) in relation to orders for capital items. Note 23.1 Financial instruments Financial reporting standard IFRS 7 requires disclosure of the role that financial instruments have had during the pe riod in creating or changing the risks a body faces in undertaking its activities. Because of the continuing service provider relationship that the Trust has with its commissioners and the way those commissioners are financed, the Trust is not exposed to t he degree of financial risk faced by business entities. Also, financial instruments play a much more limited role in creating or changing risk than would be typical of listed companies, to which the financial reporting standards mainly apply. The Trust h as considered its exposure to the following financial risks: Currency Risk - the Trust has no overseas operations and the majority of transactions are sterling based. Foreign currency transactions arise from purchases of equipment and supplies from overseas providers and a small proportion of charitable investments. However, the se are not significant in value or number of transactions and the Trust therefore has low exposure to currency rate fluctuations; Interest Rate Risk - the Trust has loans for its capital expansion programme. However, these are at fixed rates with the Independent Trust Financing Facility. The Trust therefore has low exposure to interest rate fluctuations; Credit Risk - the majority of the Trust's revenue is from contracts with other public sector bodies. The Trust holds significant cash balances but these are also held through the Government Banking Service. Therefore the Trust has low exposure to credit risk. The Charity uses a commercial bank but its cash balances are not material to the Group. The Charity's investments are managed through external invest ment managers. Investments are held in UK fixed interest bonds and a wide portfolio of UK investments. The maximum exposure on receivables at 31 March 2018 is disclosed in Note 14 Trade Receivables and Other Receivables; and 241 Liquidity Risk - the Trust's o perating costs are incurred principally under contracts with commissioners. Capital expenditure is funded principally for the provision of public sector services. The Trust is not exposed to significant liquidity risk. Note 23.2 Fair value of non -current financial assets The Charity held investments at 31 March 2018 with a fair value of \u00a3812,365 (31 March 2017: \u00a3836,015). The book value of these assets is \u00a3682,204 (31 March 2017: \u00a3685,421).

Note 25 Public dividend capital NHS Trusts are required to pay a dividend of 3.5% of their average net relevant assets to the Department of Health. This is calculated on a full financial year. The dividend is payable in two instalments in September and March. Note 26 Third party balances At 31 March 2018 the Trust held \u00a3916 on behalf of patients (31 March 2017: \u00a3516). Note 27 Related party transactions The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust is a public interest body authorised by NHS Improvement, the Independent Regulator for NHS Foundation Trusts. During the period none of the Board members or members of the key management staff, or parties related to them, has undertaken any material transactions with The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust. The Department of Health and Social Care is a related party as the parent department of the Trust. During the period The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust has had a significant number of material transactions with the Department, and with other e ntities for which the Department is regarded as the parent Department. These entities are listed below: NHS England; Health University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust; and NHS Resolution. In addition the Trust has had material transactions with the following central government body: Welsh Assembly Government including all Welsh Health bodies. In 2012/13, Liverpool Health Partners Ltd, a company limited by guarantee, was set up between the University of Liverpool, Aintree University Hospital NHS FT, Alder Hey Children's NHS FT, The Clatterbridge Cancer Centre NHS FT, Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust, Liverpool Women's NHS FT, The Walton Centre NHS FT, Liverpool Heart and Chest NHS FT and Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. The objects of the company are to advance education, health, learning a nd research by facilitating world class research among the partners. Each organisation has a single share in the company and the Chief Executives are ex -officio directors of the company. A contribution of \u00a380,000 (2016/17: \u00a380,000) was made to the company to enable it to carry out its objectives. The Trust's Council of Governors comprise 17 elected Governors, 4 staff Governors and 12 appointed Partnership Governors. Governors are drawn from a range of stakeholders including patient groups, neurological cha rities, research and academic groups, CCGs, Local Authorities, NHS England and Wales. Therefore, many, by the nature of their appointment, have interests in organisations with whom the Trust contracts. A register of interests is maintained and declarations of interests are given at each Governor meeting. Since 2013/14 the Trust has included The Walton Centre Charity as a subsidiary because the Trust has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the Fund so as to obtain benefits from its a ctivities for itself, its patients or its staff. Transactions between the Trust and the Charity are not material and are eliminated on consolidation. Assets held by the Charity are to be used for charitable purposes only. 244 The financial activity of the Charity during 2017/18 and its balance sheet at 31 March 2018 are summarised as: Summary statement of financial activities 2017/18 2016/17 \u00a3'000 \u00a3'000 Operating income (incoming resources including investment income) 466 2,591 Operating expenditure (544) (2,499) Net (outgoing)/incoming resources before other recognised gains and losses (78) 92 Fair value gains/(losses) on investments (available for sale financial assets only) (15) 111 Net movement in funds (93) 203 Summary balance sheet 31-Mar-18 31-Mar-17 \u00a3'000 \u00a3'000 Non-current assets Other Total non -current assets 812 836 Current assets Trade and other receivables 15 0 Cash and cash equivalents 525 950 Total current assets 540 950 Current liabilities Trade and other payables (59) (400) Total current liabilities (59) (400) Total net assets 1,293 1,386 Restricted funds 0 0 Unrestricted funds 1,293 1,386 Total funds 1,293 1,386 Note 28 Losses and special payments During the period the Trust made 17 (2016/17: 18) special payments with a total value of \u00a327,916 (2016/17: \u00a37,463).

Scope and subject matter The indicators for the year ended 31 March 2018 subject to the limit ed assurance engagement consist of the national priority indicators as mandated by NHS Improvement: Percentage of incomplete pathways within 18 weeks for patients on incomplete pathways at the end of the reporting period Maximum waiting time of 62 days from urgent GP referral to first treatment for all cancers We refer to these national priority indicators collectively as the 'Indicators'. Respective responsibilities of the directors and Practitioner The directors are responsible for the content and t he preparation of the Quality Report in accordance with the criteria set out in the ' NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2017/18' and supporting guidance issued by NHS Improvement. Our responsibility is to form a conclusion, based on limited assu rance procedures, on whether anything has come to our attention that causes us to believe that: the Quality Report is not prepared in all material respects in line with the Criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2017/18' and supporting guidance ; the Quality Report is not consistent in all material respects with the sources specified in NHS Improvement's 'Detailed requirements for external assurance for quality reports 2017/18'; and the indicators in the Quality Report identif ied as having been the subject of limited assurance in the Quality Report are not reasonably stated in all material respects in accordance with the ' NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2017/18' and supporting guidance and the six dimensions of dat a quality set out in the ' 'Detailed requirements for external assurance for quality reports 2017/18'. We read the Quality Report and consider whether it addresses the content requirements of the ' NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2017/18' and s upporting guidance , and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any material omissions. We read the other information contained in the Quality Report and consider whether it is materially inconsistent with: Board minutes for the pe riod 1 April 2017 to April 2018; papers relating to quality reported to the Board over the period 1 April 2017 to April 2018; feedback from commissioners dated May 2018; 246 feedback from governors dated 14 December 2017 to 13 March 2018; feedback from local Healthwatch organisations dated May 2018; feedback from the Overview and Scrutiny Committee dated May 2018; the Trust's complaints report published under regulation 18 of the Local Authority Social Services and National Health Service Complaints (England) Regulations 2009, due to be published in June 2018; the national staff survey dated March 2018; the Care Quality Commission inspection report dated April 2016; and the Head of Internal Audit's annual opinion over the Trust's control environment dated April 2016. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with those documents (collectively, the \"documents\"). Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. The firm a pplies International Standard on Quality Control 1 (Revised) and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applica ble legal and regulatory requirements. We are in compliance with the applicable independence and competency requirements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) Code of Ethics. Our team comprised assurance practitioners and relevant subject matter experts. This report, including the conclusion, has been prepared solely for the Council of Governors of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust as a body, to assist the Council of Governors in reporting The Walton Centre NHS Founda tion Trust's quality agenda, performance and activities. We permit the disclosure of this report within the Annual Report for the year ended 31 March 2018, to enable the Council of Governors to demonstrate they have discharged their governance responsibili ties by commissioning an independent assurance report in connection with the indicators. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Council of Governors as a body, and The Walton Centre NHS Fo undation Trust for our work or this report, except where terms are expressly agreed and with our prior consent in writing. 247 Assurance work performed We conducted this limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information' issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board ('ISAE 3000'). Our limited assurance procedures included: evaluating the design and implementation of the key processes and controls for managing and reporting the indicators making enquiries of management limited testing, on a selective basis, of the data used to calculate the indicators tested against supporting documentatio n comparing the content requirements of the ' NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2017/18 ' and supporting guidance to the categories reported in the Quality Report; and reading the documents. A limited assurance engagement is smaller in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement. The nature, timing and extent of procedures for gathering sufficient appropriate evidence are deliberately limited relative to a reasonable assurance engagement. Limitations Non-financial performance information is subject to more inherent limitations than financial information, given the characteristics of the subject matter and the methods used for determining such information. The absence of a significant body o f established practice on which to draw allows for the selection of different, but acceptable, measurement techniques that can result in materially different measurements and can affect comparability. The precision of different measurement techniques may a lso vary. Furthermore, the nature and methods used to determine such information, as well as the measurement criteria and the precision of these criteria, may change over time. It is important to read the Quality Report in the context of the criteria set out in the 'NHS foundation trust annual reporting manual 2017/18' and supporting guidance . The scope of our limited assurance work has not included governance over quality or non -mandated indicators, which have been determined locally by The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust. Our audit work on the financial statements of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust is carried out in accordance with our statutory obligations. This engagement will not be treated as having any effect on our separate duties and r esponsibilities as The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust's external auditors. Our audit reports on the financial statements are made solely to The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust's members, as a body, in accordance with paragraph 24(5) of Schedule 7 of the National Health Service Act 2006. Our audit work is undertaken so that we might state to The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. Our audits of The Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust's financial statements are not planned or conducted to address or reflect matters in which anyone other than such members as a body may be interested for such purpose.
