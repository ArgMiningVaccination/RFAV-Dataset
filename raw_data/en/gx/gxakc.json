NYR Organic review (Neal's Yard Remedies) of non-toxic, clean, skincare products and essential oils. NYR ORGANIC REVIEW If you've been around my site for a hot second, you know I'm [passionate about clean products](https://ecolivingmama.com/what-is-clean-beauty/). I think it is so important to use high-quality, non-toxic products for your entire body. I love [making my own products](https://ecolivingmama.com/clean-beauty/) to ensure they are high quality, good-for-you ingredients, but I also support a number of brands who share my passion for clean beauty. [NYR Organic](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/) (or Neal's Yard Remedies) ticks off all the boxes for me and is one of those companies I buy from with no hesitation. We believe beauty comes from within; natural remedies and total wellbeing are central to who we are. I recently signed up as an independent consultant for NYR Organic, and have begun using many of their products throughout my home. I don't hear much about NYR in the US from big clean beauty bloggers, and I'm quite frankly surprised. Neal's Yard Remedies is one of the cleanest brands for skincare, body care, hair care, baby products AND essential oils I have come across. I'm going to lay it all out for you in this review: why I chose this company, what I think of their products and what it means be an 'Independent Consultant' for NYR. NON TOXIC INGREDIENTS This is a big one for me, and I've done my research on [toxic ingredients in skincare products](https://ecolivingmama.com/top-10-toxic-skincare-ingredients/). I have been so pleased to find that NYR Organic meets my high standards for ingredients used in skincare and body care products. They have a big list of ingredients they ban from their products, including: - MEA/DEA derivatives - EDTA - Parabens - Phthalates - Silicones - Genetically Modified ingredients - Synthetic fragrances - BHT - Mineral oil - Triclosan Find out more about NYR's ingredient policies [here](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/sustainable-ingredients-ethically-sourced/). ORGANIC INGREDIENTS There is lots of confusion on organic ingredients in skincare and if it is really important. The short answer is YES, organic matters. There are new studies that show plants grown organically have a different nutritional makeup than conventionally grown plants. Organic crops have a higher percentage of antioxidants, lower amount of heavy metals and significantly less pesticide residue. Read more about [organic vs non-organic practices](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/download/ ) here and why it matters. Related: [How to Eat Organic on ANY Budget](https://ecolivingmama.com/eat-organic-on-a-budget/) Neal's Yard Remedies uses organic ingredients whenever possible in all of their products. Any ingredient that is not organic will always be fair-trade and GMO free, since that is part of their company standards. GMO-FREE PRODUCTS Speaking of GMOs, let's talk about that a little more, shall we? GMOs are plants that have been altered to be pesticide resistant, and there are [studies indicating how dangerous these crops](http://livingnongmo.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/GMO-Myths-and-Truths-edition2.pdf) are for our bodies. GMOs (genetically modified organisms) are plaguing our food supply and often make their way into body products as well. I avoid GMOs in every part of my life, and that includes my skincare and body products. NYR Organic is one of the few companies I have seen who actually promotes that they are GMO free, and I couldn't love this more! TIP: GMOs are forbidden in organic products, so if you always buy organic, you will also be buying GMO free. SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES Did you know that frankincense is endangered because it is typically harvested in an unsustainable way? The trees frankincense resin is harvested from, called Boswellia sacra trees, are often killed in the harvesting process, and this amazing ancient remedy is becoming more difficult to find. NYR Organic started the [Frankincense Project](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/project-frankincense/?fromlinkarea=1) to help preserve and protect these sacred trees. The frankincense they use in all of their [frankincense products](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/moisturizers/product/0716/frankincense-hydrating-cream-1-76-oz/) is some of the only sustainably harvested frankincense in the world. This is just one example of their sustainability efforts. [Read lots more here.](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/people-helping-people/?fromlinkarea=1) RECYCLED AND RECYCLABLE PACKAGING Neal's Yard Remedies uses cobalt blue glass whenever possible for their products. The bottles are beautiful and can be reused for lots of various things, or easily recycled. TIP: I love to reuse my NYR glass containers for my DIY recipes! They only use plastic when glass could be unsafe (like in the shower) or weight makes it not realistic. The plastic they use is 100% post-consumer recycled plastic and they are committed to using 100% recycled plastic by 2025. They have also banned plastic microbeads that are often used in personal care products as an exfoliant since those usually wind up as ocean pollutants. Read more about their [sustainable packaging efforts here.](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/packaging/) ETHICAL NYR Organic is a truly ethical company that looks out for our earth and all of it's inhabitants. They are transparent about ingredients and their practices, never test on animals, work with fair-trade suppliers for many of their ingredients and have a plethora of certifications to show for it. Favorite NYR Organic Products Neal's Yard Remedies has a huge selection of organic, non-toxic and safe skincare, body and baby products, as well as super high quality essential oils. These are my must-have's from NYR Organic. [ Frankincense Refining Cleanser ](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/cleansers/product/0081/frankincense-refining-cleanser-3-53-oz/) One of my favorite creamy cleansers. It's so mild and very lightly scented, this soap-free daily face wash is good for all skin types. [ Purifying Palmarosa Daily Moisture ](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/moisturizers/product/0572/purifying-palmarosa-daily-moisture-3-38-fl-oz/) A great daily moisturizer for combination and oily skin (like ME). Lots of the NYR Organic moisturizers are very rich, but this one is perfect for my combo skin. [ Baby Collection ](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/skincare-collections/product/B0129/baby-collection/) I love, love, love the baby collection from NYR! While I don't technically have any babies in my house anymore (does 3 count as a baby?? please say yes), I still use and love these products on my kids. They are mild and most importantly for their sweet, sensitive skin, NON-TOXIC. The ultimate multi-tasking beauty balm, this is a must-have for any clean beauty lover. My favorite way to use this is as a makeup remover with the organic muslin cloth it comes with. It can also be used as a moisturizing mask treatment, as a lip balm, to tame eyebrows, on dry cuticles....the list goes on and on. [ Frankincense Intense Age Defying Cream ](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/moisturizers/product/0701/frankincense-intense-age-defying-cream-1-76oz/) Looking for a heavy-hitting, super clean moisturizer that WORKS?? This is THE ONE. I love the entire frankincense line from NYR, but this moisturizer is the MVP. It's super rich (I only use a pea size amount at night) and I notice a difference in my skin almost immediately. It's very lightly scented with their organic, sustainable frankincense essential oil. [ Organic Defence Hand Spray ](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/hands-and-feet/product/0101/organic-defence-hand-spray-1-69-fl-oz/) An organic hand sanitizing spray made with completely natural and safe ingredients. Love this! [ Bee Lovely Hand Cream ](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/hands-and-feet/product/2391/bee-lovely-hand-cream-1-69-fl-oz/) Neal's Yard lotions and creams are all so rich and nourishing! This Bee Lovely hand cream is no exception - it is thick and works fabulously. It's lightly scented with orange essential oil, and, my favorite part, 10% of proceeds go to help #savethebees [ Bee Lovely All Over Balm ](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/bee-lovely/product/2385/bee-lovely-all-over-balm-1-76-oz/) Another winner from the Bee Lovely line of products that help to #savethebees, the all over balm is a great multi-tasking product! It's lightly scented with orange oil and can be used all over your body wherever you have dry skin. It is especially great for dry elbows, heels and works wonderfully as a cuticle softener. [ Organic Facial Wipes ](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/customer-favorites/product/1797/organic-facial-wipes-x25-wipes/) If you're going to use disposable facial wipes, these are the best of best. These facial wipes are made with 96% organic ingredients AND 100% organic cotton. I used these on my entire family to remove Halloween makeup (a beard painted on with mascara included), and they worked beautifully. [ Citrus Hand Wash ](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/hands-and-feet/product/0181/citrus-hand-wash-6-76-fl-oz/) A good, clean (pun-intended) hand wash that looks beautiful in your guest bathroom. I like the citrus version, but it comes in [several other scents](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/hands-and-feet/) as well. It comes in the signature glass bottle, and is a welcome departure from the cheap plastic hand wash containers. Now, I'm just waiting for NYR to start producing refills so I can reuse this glass soap jar over and over again! [ Esta Aromatherapy Diffuser ](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/diffusers/product/9390/esta-aromatherapy-diffuser/) My current favorite essential oil diffuser. It looks great in any room, is quiet, easy to clean and runs for hours at a time. What more could you ask for in a diffuser? NYR's essential oils are some of the best I've used, and they have a big selection of organic oils. Their frankincense is the only certified organic, sustainable [ frankincense essential oil](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/pure-essential-oils/product/2237/frankincense-essential-oil-0-34-fl-oz/) available in the world. [ Remedies to Roll ](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/remedies-to-roll/) Remedies to roll are ready made essential oil blends to use on your body. They are super handy and the bottles they come in are high quality and lovely (like the entire line). I especially love the Relaxation blend. [ Travel Skincare Kit ](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/skincare-kits/product/7104/travel-skincare-kit/) A great way to try out a few of my favorite products, the travel skincare kit includes several best sellers in mini-sizes and comes in an adorable cotton travel bag. It has facial wipes, hand sanitizer, wild rose beauty balm, shower gel and a facial mist. [ Nourishing Orange Flower Skincare Kit ](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/skincare-kits/product/7733/nourishing-orange-flower-skincare-kit/) NYR has complete [skincare collections](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/shop-online/category/skincare-kits/) for all skin types, and they come in mini sets so you can try them out before purchasing the full size. The nourishing orange flower line is for dry skin. The cleanser in this collection is a creamy cleanser (like the frankincense cleanser also on this list) and I really love it. I used this line when I was travelling last month to a dryer climate and my skin was happy. NEAL'S YARD REMEDIES INDEPENDENT CONSULTANT REVIEW As I mentioned before, I signed up to be an independent consultant for NYR Organic because I truly align with their company values and really love their products. I have not been interested in joining a network sales type of organization before, but this one was the right fit for me. There are low sales requirements to stay as a consultant and no minimum purchase requirements for me. I have the option of doing parties in person or online if I choose, but I do not have to. It is very flexible, and the [new consultant kit](https://us.nyrorganic.com/shop/karlasuarez/area/become-a-consultant/) is a STEAL of a deal. It seems like there is a lot of opportunity in the US for NYR Organic to grow, since it is not well known here. With the current focus on clean beauty in the beauty industry, non-toxic products are going mainstream! There is plenty of support and training available for NYR consultants, and it really is an opportunity you can make as big as you want!
