A D-dimer test is a blood test that checks for blood-clotting problems. This test measures the amount of D-dimer, a protein your body makes to break down [blood clots](/blood-clots). Why would I need a D-dimer test? Your doctor might ask you to have this test if you have symptoms of blood clotting problems. A D-dimer test may be used as part of the assessment for different problems including: [deep vein thrombosis](/deep-vein-thrombosis)(DVT) \u2014 a blood clot in your deep veins, usually in the legs [pulmonary embolism](/pulmonary-embolism)\u2014 a blood clot in an artery in your lungs - disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) \u2014 a condition that stops your blood from clotting normally - blood clotting caused by a [snake bite](/snake-bites) - thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) \u2014 a very rare blood clotting condition A D-dimer test is commonly used to rule out problems such as DVT. If you are having treatment for DIC, your doctor may use the D-dimer test to monitor your condition. How do I prepare for a D-dimer test? No preparation is needed for this test. A blood sample is usually taken from a vein in your arm. Understanding your results A positive test means the D-dimer level in your body is higher than normal. It suggests you might have a blood clot or blood clotting problems. A normal D-dimer level usually shows that a clotting problem is unlikely. The D-dimer test is usually used with other blood tests and imaging scans. That's because the D-dimer test cannot tell where in the body blood clots are or what may have caused them. Sometimes the D-dimer test can be positive in people without clotting problems. This can happen in: - older people - during pregnancy - if you are a smoker - if you have recently had surgery D-dimer tests can also be positive in people with other conditions, such as severe infections. Anticoagulant medicines (used to prevent and treat blood clots) can also affect your D-dimer test results. It's important to discuss your results with your doctor, who can explain what the results mean in your situation.
