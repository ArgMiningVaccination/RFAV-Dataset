While the causative agent is still a matter of debate, allergy to the excipient polyethylene glycol(PEG) is a possible explanation [1]. PEGis a hydrophilic polymer with variablemolecular weight and also the main con-stituent of many bowel cleansing agentsused prior to colonoscopy. Anaphylaxisto PEG-containing bowel cleansing pre- parations is exceedingly rare, with an es- timated average of four cases per year inthe USA [2].Within a timespan of 3 weeks, three pa-tients cancelled appointments for colo-noscopies at our endoscopy departmentowing to anaphylactic reactions to thePEG-containing bowel cleansing agent, which they had tolerated well for pre- vious colonoscopies. All patients had re-ceived vaccination with the COVID-19mRNA vaccine made by Moderna 12 -18 days before these events. Radioallergo-sorbent tests (RASTs) did not detectspecific anti-PEG IgE in any of the threepatients. Two patients opted for inpati- ent allergy testing at our hospital. Both had positive skin reactions after intrader-mal testing with serial dilutions of theModerna COVID-19 vaccine and one pa-tient also had a positive skin reaction toPEG 6000. Interestingly, indurated pla-ques developed on the Moderna vaccineinjection sites and lasted for 2 days. De- tailed descriptions of symptoms and clin- ical findings are provided in Table1s (see online-only Supplementary material).The onset of a new PEG allergy shortlyafter COVID-19 vaccination makes a cau-sal relationship likely. Possible mecha-nisms include a \"classical \"type 1 hyper- sensitivity by vaccine-triggered was not detect-able in any of the three patients, but thisdoes not rule out an IgE-mediated type 1 allergy owing to the sensitivity issues of RAST in general [3]. Typical skin reac-tions shortly after intradermal injectionof the vaccine itself (two patients) andPEG 6000 (one patient) may support apossible type 1 allergy. However, the for-mation of indurated cutaneous infiltra-tions after intradermal application of the vaccine could also point to elements of a T cell-mediated delayed-type hyper-sensitivity.Surprisingly, the patient who declined al-lergy testing received a second dose ofthe Moderna COVID-19 vaccine withoutan allergic reaction. However, doseseems to be a critical factor for a clinical response in patients with PEG allergy: in- cremental oral challenge of a patientwith known PEG allergy resulted in a sys-temic response only after receiving veryhigh doses, levels usually only reachedduring bowel preparation for colonosco-py [4]. Another recent case series notedindividual thresholds for dose and/or molecular weight in patients with ana- phylaxis after PEG exposure [5].Vaccine-induced de IgM/IgG causing acomplement activation-related pseu-doallergy is an alternative explanationfor the reactions seen in these three pa-tients, as this entity is usually dose-de- pendent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publication of a possiblevaccine-triggered PEG (pseudo)allergy.Healthcare professionals should beaware of the possibility of a newly devel-oped PEG allergy after COVID-19 vacci-nation. Endoscopists particularly maysee these cases as patients typically in- gest high doses of PEG during colonos- copy bowel preparation.
