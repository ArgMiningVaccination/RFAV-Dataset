HRSA is also responsible for oversight of the 340B Drug Discount Program. HRSA administers the following revolving loan programs: Health Profes- sions Student Loans (HPSL), Nursing Student Loans (NSL), Primary Care Loans (PCL) and Loans for Disadvantaged Students (LDS). These programs are financed through revolving accounts (Federal Capital Contribution) and do not receive annual appropriations. Through these revolving fund accounts, funds are awarded to institutions that in turn provide loans to individual students. As borrowers pay back loans, the program's revolving account gets replenished, and the collected funds are then used to give out new loans in the following academic years. If the program's revolving ac- count has excess funds that will not be used to provide new loans, these excess funds are returned to HRSA. Funds returned to HRSA are then awarded to programs that are in need of additional funds.

Title XXI provides Federal matching funds to States to enable them to extend coverage to uninsured children from low-income families. States are able to use title XXI funds for obtaining health benefit coverage for uninsured children through a separate CHIP program, a CHIP Medicaid expansion program, or a combination of both. The Children's Health Insur- ance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-3, CHIPRA) reau- thorized the CHIP program and appropriated funding for CHIP through fiscal year 2013. CHIPRA made some modifications to the program, in- cluding increased funding for States and territories, and support for child health quality and outreach activities. CHIPRA also created a contingency fund in a separate account to assist States who project spending above their available allocated CHIP funds. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-148) and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-10) extended CHIP funding throughfiscal year 2015 and 2017, respectively. The HEALTHY KIDS Act (P.L. 115-120) and the Advancing Chronic Care, Extenders, and Social Services Act (P.L. 115-123) extended CHIP funding through fiscal year 2023 and 2027, respectively.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (P.L. 111-148) and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-10) extended the Contingency Fund through fiscal years 2015 and 2017, respectively.

RISK ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM PAYMENTS SpecialandTrustFundReceipts (inmillionsofdollars) Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) established a permanent risk adjustment program for non- grandfathered plans in the individual and small group markets. Risk adjust- ment is budget neutral within each state and market, such that charges collected from plans with lower than average actuarial risk are used to make payments to plans with higher than average actuarial risk. Risk ad- justment may be operated by a State, or by the Federal government in the event a State chooses not to operate risk adjustment. Payments and charges are made in the year following the plan year for which they are calculated. TRANSITIONAL REINSURANCE PROGRAM 7 Section the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (P.L. 111-148) established a transitional three-year reinsurance program to minimize the impact of high-cost enrollees in plans in the individual marketfor plan years 2014, 2015, and 2016. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services assessed contributing entities a per enrollee fee to fund the rein- surance program and made payments to issuers in the individual market for enrollees whose medical costs exceed a certain threshold, up to a rein- surance cap. Reinsurance collections and payments were made in the year following the plan year for which they were applicable. Reinsurance col- lections ended in FY 2019 and outlays in subsequent fiscal years reflect remaining payments, refunds, and allowable administrative activities. CONSUMER OPERATEDAND ORIENTED PLAN PROGRAM CONTINGENCY FUND Oriented Plan Contingency Fund was estab- lished by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-240).
