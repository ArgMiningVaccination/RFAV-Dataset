Patient Success Stories \"I have been coming to Wendy for the past few months. I was feeling sick and no one was listening. Wendy listened to me, reviewed by blood test, and figured out what steps I needed to take to start feeling better. I feel tremendously better. I truly thank Wendy for actually listening to me. I just started to take my 13 year old daughter to her too. I highly recommend Wendy.\" L.R. \"I was very close to taking a pharmaceutical product and I wanted to make sure I had explored all natural solutions first. So I met with Wendy and I'm so glad I did! After a generous consultation, she was able to formulate an herbal tincture that was specific to my health needs. I noticed an improvement within days, and I've been taking the tincture for several months now. I am so thankful for Wendy's help!\" D.V. \"Wendy at the Sage Integrative Health Center has been so helpful to me and my journey of wellness! She is super smart while at the same time calm and focused on you as an individual. I have a herbal tincture from Sage that has helped me get my digestive system back on track and help with pain I was experiencing. I have also used Wendy for nutritional counseling, acute issues such as seasonal allergies and guided meditation. I would recommend Wendy and all of the services she provides at Sage Integrative Health Center. She is kind and knowledgeable and I respect her advice and care.\" S.N. \"Wendy is just amazing! She's helped me so much throughout the past few years. My sister and I both get herbal tinctures from her and they've helped tremendously. Would recommend "}
