Plan ahead If you have a stressful day or week coming up, plan ahead. This can make you feel prepared and better able to cope. To be prepared: - make a to-do list with important and urgent tasks - gather any things you will need - if you need to travel, work out the journey - make time for the things you enjoy at the end of the day or during the week - think about who you can ask for help, if you need it Break down tasks If a task seems overwhelming and difficult to start, try breaking it down into smaller parts. Complete each part and then move on to the next part. Setting realistic goals can help you manage stress. Give yourself credit when you complete a task. Focus on things you can control Feeling you have lost control is one of the main causes of stress. But it's not always possible to change or control a difficult situation. Focus on things you can control, rather than things you cannot control. This is an important part of finding a solution. For example, you might lose your job. This could be out of your control. Instead, focus on something you can control. For example, looking for a new job or a course to help you get new skills that will help you find another job. Think about the good things Take time to think about the good things in your life. Each day, think about what went well and write down 3 things you're grateful for. Talk about your feelings If you feel stressed, it can help to talk to a friend or family member about how you feel. Telling someone about how you are feeling can help to make things clearer for you. It can help you understand why you are feeling stressed and to get help with how to manage it. Breathing exercises Breathing exercises can help your mind and body get control of a difficult situation. They only take a few minutes to do and can help you manage strong emotions and reduce stress. Mindfulness Mindfulness teaches you to become aware of the present moment. This helps you enjoy things more. You can learn to not react or become overwhelmed by what's going on around you by doing mindfulness. Instead, you notice your thoughts, feelings and sensations. Mindfulness can be an easy activity you can fit into your day. Sleep well Stress can make you feel more tired than usual. It can also make it more difficult to get or stay asleep. Sleep is important for mental health. It helps you to think clearly and gives you the energy to deal with problems. Most people need 5 to 9 hours sleep a night. More than 7 hours is recommended for adults. The ideal amount is 8 hours, but everyone's different. Healthy eating What you eat can make a difference to your mental health. A diet rich in foods such as fruit, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and seeds can boost your energy and mental health. Healthier food choices can improve your mental and physical health. Physical activity Physical activity will help you sleep, relax and feel better. It helps reduce stress, burn off anxious energy and feel calm. It can also be a good way to meet people and get more involved in your community. Any activity is useful, as long as it is suited to your ability and you do enough of it. Find something that you enjoy doing. This will help keep you motivated to do it every day. Alcohol and smoking If you feel stressed, you may drink more alcohol or smoke more than you usually do. It might be tempting to use smoking and alcohol to manage stress. But try not to do this as a way of coping.
