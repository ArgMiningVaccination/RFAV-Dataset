PREFACE Dietetics in Health Care Communities, a practice group of the American Dietetic Association is proud to offer the seventh edition of the Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment . This manual has been a cumulative effort by membership since the first edition was written in 1990. This year has seen many changes within our or ganization; our name changed from Consultant Dietitians in Health Care Facilities to Diete tics in Health Care Communities, our Guiding Principles were updated changing the size and scope of the Executive Co mmittee, and the Executive Committee began producing Webinars. As this work began, so did the work on this latest edition of the Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment. We have updated every section and for the first time, include d many web links and new references to further enhance the use of this tool. We have included the following new sections: Regulatory requirements and interp retive guidelines for skilled nursing Determination of completeness of protein in protein supplements Discussion of Indirect Calorimetry Nutrition Care Process and PES statements Nutrition and Wound Care Our hope is that this tool will become part of your daily reference guides and will increase your knowledge and effectiveness in the work place. Special thanks to Katy Adams, my Coeditor, Marla Carlson, our Executive Director for her knowledge and guidance, to the other members of the Executive Committe e for their contributions and review, and to all members who wrote sections of this manual and reviewed sections. The completio n of the manual would not be possible without them. Cynthia Piland, MS, RD, CSG, LD Editor of 7 th Edition of Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment Sponsorship Chair, DHCC Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment @ DHCC 2009 iii Foreword The first edition of the Pocket Resource for Nutrition Asse ssment (PRNA) was published in 1990. This is the 7th issue. The PRNA is Dietetics in Health Care Communities (DHCC) volunteers working together to collect and organize current evidence based nutrition practices for nutrition care of the residents within long-term care, young and old. Healthcare continues to change at breakneck speed. It is our goal to keep our members at the forefront of dietetics in healthcare communities. Special thanks to Marla Carlson, Executive Director of DHCC and Cynthia Piland, RD, CSG, LD, and Katy Adams, RD, CSG, LD, Editors of PRNA. Without their hard work and dedi cation this edition would be nothing more than a great idea.

Dietitians in community based programs, skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, corrections, and rural hospitals provide nutrition screening and nut rition services to a much larger variety of clients. The nutrition services that the registered dietitian provides must be tailored to fit that client base whether they are patients, clients or residents. The dietitian must adapt to the changes in the health care communities. Each step that is taken is an improvement in the quality of life of our client populations and an increase in the awareness of the knowledge and skills of the registered dietitian. Nutrition Care Process The Nutrition Care Process (NCP) has altered the nutrition assessme nt format in all areas of health care. The Registered Dietitian (RD) or competent Dietetic Technician, Registered (DTR) is responsible for the an alysis of nutrition data to determine Nutrition Diagnosis, Intervention, and Evaluation. Nu trition Screening may be a key step in your systematic referral of high-risk patients and residents to the RD for th e NCP. Screening programs should be designed to rapidly and accurately identify those patients and r esidents who require a more comprehens ive nutrition assessment to determine if there is a nutrition problem requiring intervention. (5) A Nutrition Screening Instrument should have the following characteristics: (4) 1. A validated and reliable scale in the intended population 2. A clear definition of thresholds 3. Compatibility with skills of a generalist assessor 4. Minimal bias due to data collector 5. Acceptability to patients 6. Relatively inexpensive in time and energy costs 7. Sensitivity to change in score When selecting a Nutrition Screening Tool evaluate the popula tion for its intended use, what you are screening for, and whether or not it has been validated.

The ADA Evidence Analysis Team has completed an extensive literature search on the validity of predictive energy needs equations. These equations are used to predict resting metabolic rate (RMR). (1) These equations can be found in various reference materials. \" It is clear that the practitioner should become aware of the limitations and the use of these equations .\" (1) A review of current literature still demonstr ates several equations and methods to determine needs. The literature suggests that a comprehensive review of intake, consis tency in assessment and recommendations for interventions are all key steps in the process. The American Dietetic Association has completed evidence based analysis of several methods. The Harris-Benedict Equation has been widely used by dietetics professionals and has been cited in this reference since the first edition. Although this equation was said to meas ure basal energy expenditure (BEE), in fact, it measures RMR. Indirect calorimetry is the most accurate measurement of r esting metabolic rate, but if this method is not available the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation is the most accurate for overw eight and obese individuals. (reference ADA pocket guide) It is important to note that predictive equations are not as reliab le in older adults as in other age groups. There is limited information available on older adults, especi ally those over the age of 80 years. Information on nonwhite ethnic groups is also limited. Both the Harris-Benedict and the Mifflin-St. Jeor Equations ar e included. Dietitians are encouraged to review current literature and research at the ADA Evidence Based Library and to continue to follow th e evidence-based research. Harris-Benedict Equation Basal Energy Expenditure (BEE) The equation varies depending on the sex of the subject. Men: BEE = 66.47 + (13.75 x Weight in kg) + (5.0 x Height in cm) - (6.76 x Age in yrs) Women: BEE = 655.10 + (9.56 x Weight in kg) + (1.85 x Height in cm) - (4.68 x Age in yrs) Mifflin-St. Jeor Equation Men: RMR = (9.99 x weight) + (6.25 x height) - (4.92 x age) + 5 Women: RMR = (9.99 x weight) + (6.25 x height) - (4.92 x age) - 161 BEE Tables (based on Harris-Benedict equation) (2) How to Use Tables on pages 38-43: Step 1: Obtain weight, height, age and sex of subject. Step 2: Using the tables on the following pages, dete rmine the appropriate kCals for the height, weight, age and sex of the subject using the following formula. Step 3: BEE = weight kCal + height kCal - age kCal Example: Sex: 70 kilogram Height: 178 centimeter (cm) Age: 45 BEE = 1029 + 889 - 304 = 1614 BASAL ENERGY EXPENDITURE (BEE) Nutritional Needs and Assessment Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 4 HEIGHT - MALE ft in in cm kCal ft in in cm kCal ft in in cm 4' 213.4 1067 BASAL ENERGY EXPENDITURE (BEE) WEIGHT - MALE lbs kg kCal lbs kg kCal lbs kg kCal lbs kg kCal lbs kg kCal kg 1524 99 1428 250.8 114 1634 BASAL ENERGY EXPENDITURE (BEE) AGE - MALE yr kCal yr kCal yr kCal yr kCal yr kCal yr kCal yr kCal 18 122 28 189 38 257 48 324 58 392 68 460 78 527 88 595 93 629 19 128 29 196 39 264 49 331 59 399 69 466 79 534 89 602 94 635 20 135 30 203 40 270 50 331 60 406 70 473 80 541 90 608 95 642 21 142 31 210 41 277 51 345 61 412 71 480 81 548 91 615 96 649 22 149 32 216 42 284 52 352 62 419 72 487 82 554 92 622 97 656 23 155 33 223 43 291 53 358 63 426 73 493 83 561 24 162 34 230 44 297 54 365 64 433 74 500 84 568 25 169 35 237 45 304 55 372 65 439 75 507 85 575 26 176 36 243 46 311 56 379 66 446 76 514 86 581 27 183 37 250 47 318 57 385 67 453 77 521 87 588 Nutritional Needs and Assessment Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 5 BASAL ENERGY EXPENDITURE (BEE) HEIGHT - FEMALE ft in in cm kCal ft in in cm kCal ft in in cm 4' 61 154.9 287 11\" 71 180.3 334 52 244 268 7\" 67 170.2 315 BASAL ENERGY EXPENDITURE (BEE) WEIGHT - FEMALE lbs kg kCal lbs kg kCal lbs kg kCal lbs kg kCal lbs kg kCal kg 109 1697 BASAL ENERGY EXPENDITURE (BEE) AGE - FEMALE yr kCal yr kCal yr kCal yr kCal yr kCal yr kCal yr kCal 18 84 28 131 38 178 48 225 58 271 68 318 78 365 88 412 98 459 19 89 29 136 39 183 49 229 59 276 69 323 79 370 89 417 99 463 20 94 30 140 40 187 50 234 60 281 70 328 80 374 90 421 100 468 21 98 31 145 41 192 51 239 61 285 71 332 81 379 91 426 101 473 22 103 32 150 42 197 52 243 62 290 72 337 82 384 92 431 102 477 23 108 33 154 43 201 53 248 63 295 73 342 83 388 93 435 24 112 34 159 44 206 54 253 64 300 74 346 84 393 94 440 25 117 35 164 45 211 55 257 65 304 75 351 85 398 95 445 26 122 36 168 46 215 56 262 66 309 76 356 86 402 96 449 27 126 37 173 47 220 57 267 67 314 77 360 87 407 97 454 Nutritional Needs and Assessment Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 6 BEE Tables For males: To use the chart, find the number for the height and we ight and then subtract the age number to determine BEE.

Energy Estimation in Obesity (1) The use of either the Harris-Benedict or Mifflin-St. Jeor pr edictive equations to estimate en ergy needs for obese adults is less accurate and has an increas ed range of individual errors compared to estimates for non-obese. Review of evidence- based literature found that in healthy obese individuals, use of the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation was more accurate and had a smaller magnitude of error. Each equation has its limitati ons. Practitioners are urged to exercise clinical judgment in their choice of which equation to use and when to use it. Mifflin-St. Jeor Equation - 70% accuracy, estimates of RMR may range from 20% below needs to 15% above needs. Harris-Benedict Equation - 38% - 64% accuracy using actual body weight, errors tend to be overestimates, RMR needs ranged from 35% below to 43% above 26% accuracy using adjusted body weight, RM R needs ranged from 42% below to 25% above Use of adjusted body weight in HBE reduces risk of overestimating RMR but drastically increases the maximum underestimation error. ADA expert panel recommends avoiding use of this equation in obesity Energy Estimation for Older Adults (1) There is limited data on the use of BEE/RMR equations in el derly adults. In general th ese formulas do not work well for this age group; the age range in trials is 50 - 84 years, with few studies of subjects over 80 years.

INDIRECT CALORIMETRY Indirect calorimetry (IC) is considered the gold standard for energy expenditure estimation . IC determines resting metabolic rate (RMR) by measuring respiratory gas exchange . Measured RMR is preferred to the use of prediction equations because such equations fail by more than 10% in up to one third of patients. Because IC quantifies stress due to injury, illness, and other idiosyncratic me dical conditions, including the affects of medications, the dietitian only needs to apply the appropriate activity factor. Pros: Advances in technology make IC accurate, affordab le, accessible, and easy to admi nister with minimal staff training. Cons: Food, ethanol, stimulants, physical activity, and ambien t conditions affect RMR; therefore, adherence to pre-test protocol is necessary to obtain accurate results. Costs: IC units range in price from $4000 to $20,000. In surance reimbursement for IC ranges from $10 to $130. \"Because energy expenditure is difficult to predict on the basis of conventional equations, patients in long-term acute care facilities routinely are overfed and underfed, wi th only 25% receiving calories within 10% of required needs. Measuring a patient's energy requirement at le ast once by IC is important, because the degree of metabolism predicts how easily a patient will be underfed or overfed.\" - McClave, S, Are patients fed appropriately according to their caloric requirements?, JPEN, Nov-Dec 1998; vol.

This can affect interpretation of biochemical measurements, anthropometry and the physical exam. Ass essment of hydration is quic k and easy and should include assessment of fluid intake. Method I: Wt (kg) x 30 ml = Daily Fluid Requirement Fluid requirements may differ for those clients with cardiac problems, renal fa ilure, dehydration or for those requiring fluid restrictions. Method II: 100 ml/kg for 1 st ten kg body weight + 50 ml/kg for 2nd ten kg body weight + 15 ml/kg for remaining kg body weight Shortcut Method II: (kg body weight - 20) x 15 + 1500 = ml fluid requirement Serum Osmolality (13) Osmolality measures the concentration of particles in solu tion. Osmolality increases with dehydration (loss of water without loss of solutes) and decreases with overhydration. Greater than normal levels may indicate: Dehydration, Di abetes Insipidus, Hyperglycemi a, inappropriate ADH secretion. Serum Osmolality = (2 x (Na + K)) + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18) An online calculator of serum osmolality is available at (accessed 22 September 2009). Normal range is 285-295 mOsm/kg.

Nutritional Needs and Assessment Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 13 ANTHROPOMETRIC ASSESSMENT: HEI GHT/WEIGHT/FRAME ESTIMATIONS Body weight is the most useful single observation for assessme nt of nutritional status. Frequently, residents report their own height and weight rather than being measured. A ccurately measured height and weight are essential for an appropriate nutritional assessment. Establishing an ideal wei ght range and documenting histor ical or usual body weight range are also components of the assessment. Methods of Estimating Height of Person If one is unable to obtain an accura te height, two options exist: 1. Arm span measurement The measurement of the arm span is roughly equal to the ma ximal height of both men and women at maturity (within approximately 10%). (1) Arm span measurement is calcula ted as follows: With the upper extremities, including the hands, fully extended and parallel to the ground, measure the di stance between the tip of one middle finger to the tip of the other middle finger. If necessary, the measurement from mid-sternum to tip of middle finger on the dominant hand when multiplied by 2 can also be used to estimate height. The arm span measurement remains constant in spite of decreasing height and is an acceptable alternate method for establishing height. Document: Estimated height. This may not be accurate in Asians, A frican Americans or in clients with spinal deformities or contractures. (2) 2. Stature from knee height Knee height can be used to estimate the stature of an elderl y person who is bedfast or chair bound or who has such spinal curvature that an accurate stature measurement cannot be obtained. Document this as estimated height. This estimated stature value can then be used in indexes when estimating b asal energy expenditure with th e Harris-Benedict equation or the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation (see Nutritional Needs - Section 3). The measurement is made from the bottom of the heel to the anterior surface of the thigh at the knee. The knee should be bent at a 90\u00ba angle. Two or more measurements should be made to improve accuracy. Supine knee height is considered more accurate than seated knee height. Knee height calipers should be used. Note: This is not an exact procedure. The actual height of the el derly may be less. It also may not be accurate for Asians or African Americans. The computation of stature requires the person's knee height, ag e, sex and race. To convert the estimated stature from centimeters to inches, use the following: Stature in inches = Stature in cm/2.54. Calculating Stature from Knee Height - Male MALES 6 TO 18 YEARS NOTE: Estimated statu re should be within... White Males Stature (cm) = [Knee Height (cm) x 2.22] + 40 .54 \u00b1 8.42 cm of actual stature for 95% of white boys.

If a calculator is not available, an elderly person's stature can be estimated from the nomogram. To use this nomogram, locate the person's age on the left column and knee height on the middle column. Connect these two points; where the connecting line crosses the stature column for th e appropriate sex is the estimated stature. Nutritional Needs and Assessment Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 15 Elbow Breadth : Elbow breadth on the right arm is measured with the forearm upward at a 90 angle. The distance between the outer aspects of the two prominent bones on either si de of the elbow is considered to be the elbow breadth. Elbow breadth less than that listed for medium frame indicates a small frame. Elbow breadth greater than that listed for medium frame indicates a large frame. (3, 4) Frame Size for Women Frame Size for Men Height in 1 inch heels Elbow breadth for medium frames Height in 1 inch heels Elbow breadth for medium frames 4'10\" to 4'11\" The CMS F325 Interpretive Guidelines for Surveyors states that \"usual body weight prior to decline or admission is the most relevant basis for weight relate d interventions.\" (5). Usual Body Weight (UBW) is the preferred standard, when assessing the elderly. Usual body weight has no definitive time reference. Recommenda tions vary as to what time reference to use to determine usual weight. CMS recommends before admission into an acute or skilled facility or before a noticeable decline in health occurs. Determine admission weight, history of past weights from patient/resident medical history, recall or from family. Consider usual weight for a period of 6 months to 12 months before assessment. Weight stability in the older adult, for a period of 6 months or more, is important to attain (6). Ideal Body Weight (IBW) IBW can be approximated using the Hamwi Formula. It is sometimes referred to as Recommended Body Weight, Desired Body Weight, Ideal Weight Range or Optimal Body Weight.

Reprinted with permission from the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, Feb; 95(2):215-8. Amputations (7) For people who can be weighed, an estimate of total body weight (Wt E) including missing limb can be calculated as follows: W t E = Wt O / (1-P) Where, Wt O is the proportion (percentage) of total body weight represented by the missing limb segment(s) as shown in the figure on the previous page. For example: the estimated weight of a person with one leg amputated at the knee that weighs 70 kg post amputation would be: 70 kg divided by (1-0.059) = 70 kg divided by (0.941) = 74.4 kg = Wt E Paraplegics and Quadriplegics To calculate the estimated body weight for individuals who are paralyzed, first determine the ideal body weight for the non-paralyzed client then subtract the estimated percen tage of weight based upon the degree 5% to Index (BMI) BMI measures weight in relation to height and is an indicator of body composition. It is commonly used to predict health risk. The BMI ranges shown are for adults and are not exact fo r predicting healthy and unhealthy weights. Even within the healthy BMI range, weight gains ma y carry health risks for adults. (8) BMI is useful as a general guideline to monitor trends in the population, but by itself is not diagnostic of an individual's health status. Limitations of BMI are that very muscular people may fall into the \"overweight\" category when they are actually healthy and fit and people who have lost muscle ma ss, such as the elderly, may be in the \"healthy weight\" category\u2014according to their BMI\u2014when they actually have re duced nutritional reserves. Tw o recent studies have found that a BMI in the elderly of 22-25 were associated with a decrease in mortality.

Medical, Social and Dietary History Food/nutritional, medical and social histories are key elem ents in assessing the client, in determining the nutrition diagnosis, in formulating the PES statement and in developing the nutritional interventi ons that lead to an individualized care plan. Collecting history data depends on the practice setting. For i ndividuals, data can come directly from the patient/client through interview, a medical record, the family or care giver and the referring health care provider. The following information is included in the initial assessment data collecti on. Refer to Step I of the Nutrition Care Process in the American Dietetic Association. International Dietetics & Nutrition T erminology (IDNT) Reference Manual - Second Edition . 2009. The history should include the following: 1. Primary/secondary diagnoses 2.

Energy Assessment including: Age Body weight, height, composition Gender Infection and fever Malabsorption Medication effects Nutritional status Physical Activity Presence/severity of illness Trauma and wounds Ventilation Nutrition in the Prevention and Treatment of Pressure Ulcers A pressure ulcer is a localized injury to the skin or underlying tissue, usually over a bony prominence that is a result of pressure or of pressure combined with shear or fricti on. (NPUAP 2007) The multiple stages of pressure ulcers are identified and described below. The registered dietitian (R D) will screen and assess clients at risk for or who have pressure ulcers per the Standards of Practice/Standards of Professional Performance (SOP/SOPP) of the American Dietetic Association (ADA). Stages of a Pressure Ulcer Suspected Deep Tissue Injury : Purple or maroon localized area of discolored intact skin or blood-filled blister due to damage of underlying soft tissue from pressure and/or shear. Deep Tissue Description : The area may be preceded by tissue that is painful, firm, mushy, boggy, warmer or cooler as compared to adjacent tissue. Deep tissue injury may be difficult to detect in individuals with dark skin tones. Evolution may include a thin blister over a dark ulcer bed. The ulcer may further evolve and become covered by thin eschar. Evolution may be rapid, exposing additional layers of tissue even with optimal treatment. Stage I : Intact skin with non-blanchable redness of a locali zed area, usually over a boney prominence. Darkly pigmented skin may not have visible blanching; its color may differ from the surrounding area. Stage 1 Description : The area may be painful, firm, soft, warmer or cooler as compared to adjacent tissue. Stage I may be difficult to detect in individuals with dark skin tones. May indicate 'at risk' persons (a heralding sign of risk) Nutritional Needs and Assessment Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 21 Stage II: Partial thickness loss of dermis presenting as a sha llow open ulcer with a red pink wound bed, without slough*. May also present as an intact or open/ruptured serum-filled blister. Stage II Description: Presents as a shiny or dry shallow ulcer without slough or bruising (bruising indicates suspected deep tissue injury). This stage should not be u sed to describe skin tears, ta pe burns, perineal dermatitis, maceration or excoriation. Stage III: Full thickness tissue loss. Subcutaneous fat may be visible but bone, tendon or muscle is not exposed. Slough may be present but does not obscure the depth of tissue loss. May include undermining and tunneling. Stage III Description: the depth of a Stage III pressure ulcer varies by anatomical location. The bridge of the nose, ear, occiput and malleolus do not have subcutaneous tissue and Stage III ulcers can be shallow. In contrast areas of significant adiposity can develop extremely deep Stage III pressure ulcers. Bone/tendon is not visible or directly palpable. Stage IV: Full thickness tissue loss with exposed bone, tendon or muscle. Slough or eschar may be present on some parts of the wound bed. Often include undermining and tunneling. Stage IV Description: The depth of a Stage IV pressure ulcer varies by anatomical location. The bridge of the nose, ear, occiput and malleolus do not have subcutaneous tissue and these ulcers can be shallow. Stage IV ulcers can extend into muscle and/or supporting structures (e.g ., fascia, tendon or joint capsule) making osteomyelitis possible. Exposed bone/tendon is visible or directly palpable. Unstageable : Full thickness tissue loss in which the base of the ulcer is covered by slough (yellow, tan, gray, green or brown) and/or eschar (tan, brown or black) in the wound bed. Unstageable Description: Until enough slough and/or eschar is removed to expose the base of the ulcer, the true depth, and therefore stage, cannot be determined. Stable (dry, adherent, intact without erythema or fluctuance) eschar on the heels serves as \"the body's natural (biolo gical) cover: and should not be removed. (NPUAP 2007) Pressure Ulcer Prevention The nutrition risk factors for pressure ulcer development include: Under nutrition, mal nutrition, protein energy malnutrition (PEM), and hydra tion deficits (CMS 2008). Earl y screening and assessment is critical in identifying the contributing risk factors and appropriate interventions to remove or modify the nutrition risk. Little specific evidence exists related to nutrition care for preventing pressure ulcers beyond meeting basic calorie and protein requirements . (AMDA 2008, NPUAP/EPUAP 2009) Nutrition Treatment of Pressure Ulcers Residents with pressure ulcers should be screened and asse ssed by the nutrition professional upon admission, change in condition, and/or when the pressure ulce r is not healing. (NPUAP/EPUAP 2009) The nutrition professional will evaluate the severity of the nutritional problems, rate of weight loss, change in appetite, rationale for altered nutritional status, th e resident's prognosis, projected clinical course, food consistencies in relation to their ability to chew/swallow, the resident's wishes and goals. Evaluate the risk versus benefit of liberalizing th e diet by the discontinuation of unnecessary dietary restrictions. Over-supplementing resident's who do not have protein, vitamin, or mineral deficiencies is not recommended. Calories Provide sufficient calories 30 to 35 calories/kg body weight Adjust formula based on weight loss, weight gain, or level of obesity Protein Provide adequate protein for positive nitrogen balance 1.25 to 1.5 grams protein/kg body weight when co mpatible with goals of care and reassess as condition changes Adjust formula based on renal function, liver function Fluids Provide and encourage adequate da ily fluid intake for hydration Individuals consuming high levels of protein may re quire additional fluid. Total flu id needs include water content of food consumed. 1 mL fluid per calorie fed (enteral nutrition) Nutritional Needs and Assessment Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 22 Evaluate signs and symptoms of dehydration. El evated temperature, vomiting, profuse sweating, diarrhea, heavily draining wounds contribute to fluid loss, which must be replaced. Vitamins/Minerals Encourage consumption of a balanced diet whic h includes good sources of vitamins and minerals Daily multivitamin mineral supplement when daily in take is poor or deficienc ies are confirmed or suspected. Prior to recommending additional supplementation, revi ew any vitamin/ mineral supplement, enteral formula, oral nutritional supplement, and/or fortified food offered to determine the micronutrient content Vitamin C, Zinc: Supplement above the RDA/AI if su spected or confirmed deficiency is present. High serum zinc levels may interf ere with copper metabolism and induce a copper deficiency. Amino Acids Supplemental glutamine has not been shown to improve wound healing (McCauley 1991) Supplemental arginine does not have a confirmed effect on pressure ulcer healing (L angkamp-Henken 2000) Further research is needed to support the effec tiveness of these amino acids alone or comb ined with other nutrients (Langer 2003) Biochemical Data Biochemical data is one component of th e complete nutrition assessment process. There is not a specific lab value that will confirm a resident's nutritional status. Historically album in and prealbumin have been referenced, albeit incorrectly, as a reliable marker for visceral protein stores. The reduc tion in serum albumin and prealbumin may be related to metabolic stress, inflammatory cytokine production, or ot her comorbidities beyond nutrition. In fact research shows hepatic proteins, such as albumin and prealbumin, correlate with the severity of the underlying disease rather than nutritional status. (Myron-Johnson 2007) *Continuing weight loss and failure of a pressure ulcer to heal despite reasonable efforts to improve caloric and nutrient intake may indicate the resident is in a multi-system failure or end-stage or e nd-of-life condition warranting an additional assessment of the resident's overall condition. (CMS 2008) Role of Nutrition in Pressure Ulcer Healing (Quick Reference Guide Version) 1. Screen and assess nutritional status for each individual w ith a pressure ulcer at admission and with each condition change and/or when progress toward pressure ulcer cl osure is not observed.

Avoidable means that the resident did not maintain acceptable pa rameters of nutritional status and the the facility did not do one or more of the following: (3) Evaluate the resident's clinical condition and nutritional risk factors; Define and implement interventions th at are consistent with resident n eeds, resident goals, and recognized standards of practice; Monitor and evaluate the impact of the interventions; or Revise the interventions as appropriate. Unavoidable means that the resident did not maintain acceptable para meters of nutritional status even though the facility Had evaluated the resident's clinical condition and nutritional risk factors; Defined and implemented interventions th at are consistent with resident needs, goals, and recognized standards of practice; Monitored and evaluated the impa ct of the interventions; and Revised the approaches as appropriate. Insidious weight loss refers to a gradual, unintende d, progressive weight loss over time Usual body weight refers to the resident's usual weight thr ough adult life or a stable weight over time. Identifying Risks and Assessing Weight Loss Weight loss with aging is common. Research concludes mo st weight changes in older adults can be addressed and interventions put in place if the interdi sciplinary team is involved. (2) Weight has proven to be the reliable marker of nutritional status for long term care populations. This wei ght loss is associated with in creased risk for infection, depression and death. (1, 2) Early identifi cation of weight loss or the risk of weight loss is essential to help prevent additional complications from the weight loss. Per regula tions, weight loss risks need to be assessed timely, have aggressive efforts/interventions and f acilities should have systems in place for carrying out approaches and evaluating effectiveness. Involuntary weight loss can be unavoidable or avoidable. It is often caused by depression, cancer, cardiac disorders and gastrointestinal disease. (1) Additional weight loss risks are malnutrition, dehydration, taste and sensory changes, dependence for eating and dysphagia. (3) Identify these and other factors that w ould increase the resident's risks in the nutrition assessment while considering the following: Physical appearance and signs of recent weight changes Receiving mechanically altered diet or therapeutic diet Ability to chew, eating Dining location and seating companions Disease processes (dementia, COPD, CHF can increase energy needs) Sensory losses (taste, sight, hearing; ability to smell and to feel/hold utensils) (2) Side effects of medications and/or too many medications Depression and other psychological concerns Lab values Medication changes , including decrease/elim ination of some psychotropic medications Acceptance of the fortified foods or supplements When actual weight loss occurs, identify why and document weight changes and trends as part of the nutritional assessment. Usual body weight, weight changes prior to admi ssion, edema, amputations/prosthetics and changes with intake patterns should be included. (3) Any changes in the resi dent's weight should be clearly noted with possible etiology Nutritional Needs and Assessment Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 25 including fluid weight changes or terminal, progressive cond itions. Any new conditions that could affect weight stability should be discussed. Sudden weight changes may indicate fluid loss and electrolyte imba lance. Determine if there is a change in mental status, onset of poor intake, trends in lab values and adjustment of medications indicating a possible fluid weight loss. Facilities should have a plan in place to reweigh those with any suspicious weight cha nge. Weights should be redone within 48 hours of the first finding. If there is a significan t weight change, weekly weights should be done for four (4) weeks. An initial note and follow-up note should be done by the registered dietitian (RD). It is important to involve the health care team when investig ating weight changes. Include the physician to help evaluate and manage possible causes. The pharmacist consultant can provi de invaluable input on medication side affects related to nutrition and intake. A specific cause of unintentional weight loss in the elderly is not identified in approximately one quarter of elderly patients. These are \"unexplained\" weight losses. (This means th at despite all interventions and physical work up, the weight loss continues and cannot be attributed to anything speci fic.) If there is a physical cause (unavoidable) of weight loss, it would surface within six months. Therefore, monitoring of continued weight loss is essential. (1) Ensure that all possible interventions are in place. Make adjustments as needed to the care provided during this wa iting period. Unexplained weight loss should be documented in the nutritio n assessment/reassessment in re gards to advancing chronic conditions, end of life situati ons and the honoring of the Living Will. Unknown etiology and decline in conditions should be documented by the physician. Calculating Percentage of Weight Loss Determining the significance of weight loss as well as actual we ight loss in pounds is specified in the requirements for participation in Medicare/Medicaid Facilities (OBRA). Percent weight change = (usual weight - actual weight) x 100 Usual weight Time Interval Significant Weight Loss (%) Severe Weight Loss (%) 1 week 1.0 - 2.0 Greater than 2.0 1 month 5.0 Greater than 5.0 3 months 7.5 Greater than 7.5 6 months 10 Greater than 10.0 Nutritional Needs and Assessment Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 26 SIGNIFICANT WEIGHT CHANGES Initial Initial Initial Initial Weight 5% 65 62 60 59 85 81 79 77 105 100 97 95 125 119 116 113 66 63 61 59 86 82 80 77 106 101 98 95 126 120 117 113 67 64 62 60 87 83 81 78 107 102 99 96 127 121 118 114 68 65 63 61 88 84 82 79 108 103 100 97 128 122 118 115 69 66 64 62 89 85 83 80 109 104 101 98 129 123 119 116 70 67 65 63 90 86 84 81 110 105 102 99 130 124 120 117 71 67 66 64 91 86 85 82 111 105 103 100 131 124 121 118 72 68 67 65 92 87 86 83 112 106 104 101 132 125 122 119 73 69 68 66 93 88 87 84 113 107 105 102 133 126 123 120 74 70 68 67 94 89 87 85 114 108 105 103 134 127 124 121 75 71 69 68 95 90 88 86 115 109 106 104 135 128 125 122 76 72 70 68 96 91 89 86 116 110 107 104 136 129 126 122 77 73 71 69 97 92 90 87 117 111 108 105 137 130 127 123 78 74 72 70 98 93 91 88 118 112 109 106 138 131 128 124 79 75 73 71 99 94 92 89 119 113 110 107 139 132 129 125 80 76 74 72 100 95 93 90 120 114 111 108 140 133 130 126 81 77 75 73 101 96 93 91 121 115 112 109 141 134 130 127 82 78 76 74 102 97 94 92 122 116 113 110 142 135 131 128 83 79 77 75 103 98 95 93 123 117 114 111 143 136 132 129 84 80 78 76 104 99 96 94 124 118 115 112 144 137 133 130 Initial Initial Initial Initial Weight 5% 145 138 134 131 165 157 153 149 185 176 171 167 205 195 190 185 146 139 135 131 166 158 154 149 186 177 172 167 206 196 191 185 147 140 136 132 167 159 155 150 187 178 173 168 207 197 192 186 148 141 137 133 168 160 155 151 188 179 174 169 208 198 192 187 149 142 138 134 169 161 156 152 189 180 175 170 209 199 193 188 150 143 139 135 170 162 157 153 190 181 176 171 210 200 194 189 151 143 140 136 171 162 158 154 191 181 177 172 211 200 195 190 152 144 141 137 172 163 159 155 192 182 178 173 212 201 196 191 153 145 142 138 173 164 160 156 193 183 179 174 213 202 197 192 154 146 142 139 174 165 161 157 194 184 179 175 214 203 198 193 155 147 143 140 175 166 162 158 195 185 180 176 215 204 199 194 156 148 144 140 176 167 163 158 196 186 181 176 216 205 200 194 157 149 145 141 177 168 164 159 197 187 182 177 217 206 201 195 158 150 146 142 178 169 165 160 198 188 183 178 218 207 202 196 159 151 147 143 179 170 166 161 199 189 184 179 219 208 203 197 160 152 148 144 180 171 167 162 200 190 185 180 220 209 204 198 161 153 149 145 181 172 167 163 201 191 186 181 162 154 150 146 182 173 168 164 202 192 187 182 163 155 151 147 183 174 169 165 203 193 188 183 164 156 152 148 184 175 170 166 204 194 189 184 Nutritional Needs and Assessment Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 27 Tools to Utilize to Assess Weight Trends and Significant Weight Changes 1. QI reports 2. Facility weight records and computerized weight change reports 3. Nutrition care alerts to assess warning signs of unintentional weight loss 4. Investigative protocols for nutritio nal status, hydration and dining Interventions After assessing weight change, decide which interventions ma y reverse or stop the trend. The ADA Position paper on the liberalization of diets states that using a liberalized diet approach can produce benefits of improved intake, less weight loss and better quality of life of the residents. Unintended wei ght loss has been shown in residents who have inadequate intake at just a few meals per week. Therefore, intake should be maximized at each meal, snack and hydration opportunity. (2) Examples of interventions: Notify physician of weight loss; communicate and document. Update food preferences including cultural and religious preferences; involve family members. Add favorite snacks, choice of fortified foods or/and s upplements, increase portions of favorite foods. Consider nontraditional supplements to increase intake, i.e.: peanut butter/chocolate cups, soft drink floats with ice cream or sherbet, homemade cookies or cake squares. Observe ability to feed self and amount of spillage; in volve nursing and occupational therapy (OT); increase assistance as needed; refer to OT for screening. Change location of dining: encourage having meals in th e day room or dining room; discourage dining alone in their room; change resident's table mates; assu re comfortable position du ring dining/being fed. Monitor chewing and swallowing ab ility and involve speech therapy. If there is poor acceptance of mechanically altered diet or resident verbalizes refusal, assess potential for upgrade with Speech Therapist. Weigh more frequently. Assess with team for potential medication changes to improve appetite: Involve the family or responsible party for ideas or answers to improve intake patterns Determine resident's usual body wei ght and weight history pattern from family members if possible. Reevaluate intake and meal time histories. Determine family wishes and resident's wishes for tube feeding and IV therapy; document these wishes. When Weight Loss Cannot Be Corrected If a resident cannot maintain acceptable parameters of nutr itional status, which includes weight, despite appropriate interventions, then this must be identified in the documenta tion. The physician should be involved with this conclusion and document as well. Continued weight loss may be an expected outcome. (3) Continue to provide all interventions the resident is willi ng to accept; assess if weighing the resident can be discontinued depending on comfort and resident/family wishes; updat e the care plan, include hospice care input; and document multidisciplinary team/family meeting regarding tube feeding options. Monitor and Evaluate Interventions The dining and food service Centers for Medicare & Medi caid Services (CMS) protocol seeks to determine if the nourishing, palatable attractive meals are served; that services ar e provided to maintain or improve eating skills; and that dining experience enhances the quality of life. (2) There should also be a facility system in place to identify and monitor residents at nutrition risk which includes those showing undesirable weight trends. Facility interventions to explore include: Weighing procedures, methods of recording/comp aring; frequency, and accuracy of weights. Improving presentation of meal and dining experience. Assuring service of food at acceptable temperatures. Providing education to nursing/staff on positive atmos phere when presenting food or assisting with meals; on strategies to encourage intake; and best practic es for assisting residents during meal times. Nutritional Needs and Assessment Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 28 Increasing appropriate exercise opportunities thr ough therapy and recreation departments. Designing quality assurance audits and studies related to nutrition risks. Implementing weight committee to review week ly, monthly, six month, yearly changes. The following quote from the Journal of American Medical Directors Association summarizes the importance of nutrition assessment in regards to weight loss. \"Quality nutritional practice in long t erm care involves caref ul assessment of barriers to adequate nutrition; reduction of risk factors; a ttention to specialized diets; food presentation; and supplements, when appropriate; awareness of the import ance of psychosocial and environmental issues; and consideration of the role of medication both as a cause and a therapeutic adjunct\". (4) Be concerned about trends in both weight losses and gains. Addressing trends in weight loss can decrease the impact of other significant changes. Addressing trends in weight ga ins can decrease worsening medi cal conditions, abrupt changes in meal or dietary patterns and increases in medication needs. Utilize the Interdisclipinary Team (IDT) to review medica tions, activities, behaviors and changes in daily routines. References 1. Huffman G B.

The Nutrition Care Process: Nutrition Screening and Assessment Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 29 NUTRITION CARE PROCESS Nutrition Care Process (NCP) The purpose of the nutrition care process is to provide a st andardized process for providing nutrition care. The care itself remains individualized. \"Providing high-quality nutr ition care means doing the right thing at the right time, in the right way, for the right person, and achieving the best possible results .\" (1) The NCP is a four-step process that helps the registered di etitian (RD) to think critically and make decisions in a consistent and systematic manner. It is the standard of practice for nutrition documentation. The NCP promotes a higher probability of good outcomes and helps the dietitian track and document those outcomes. The components of each step of the process are to be tailored to the type of service. Within a medical setting this may involve medical nutrition therapy (MNT); in community or wellness settings it may focus on services such as nutrition education or weight loss. The NCP consists of 4 steps: 1. Nutrition Assessment - a method of obtaining, verifying, and inte rpreting data to identify a nutrition-related problem. 2. Nutrition Diagnosis - Consistently describe nutrition problems so that they are clear within and outside the profession. The registered dietitian identifies and labels a specific nutrition diagnosis that she or he is responsible for treating independently. 3. Nutrition Intervention - the diagnosis ideally resolves or at least the signs and symptoms improve. Specific actions used to remedy a nutrition diagnosis. The interv entions should be aimed at the etiology of the problem. 4. Nutrition Monitoring and Evaluation - Determine the amount of progress made. Track the patient outcomes relevant to the diagnosis, intervention, plans and goals. Nutrition Assessment Nutrition assessment is a \" systematic process of obtaining, verifying, and interpreting data in order to make decisions about the nature and cause of nutrition-related problems... .Nutrition assessment requires making comparisons between the information obtained and reliable standards (ideal goals) .\" [It is] \" an on-going, dynamic process that involves not only initial data collection, but also continual reassessment and analysis of needs .\" (1) Five Domains for Assessment: 1. Food/Nutrition - Related History 2. Biochemical Data, Medical Tests, and Procedures 3. Anthropometric Measurements 4. Nutrition - Focused Physical Findings 5. Client History Assessment organizes and evaluates information in orde r to declare a professional judgment. Nutrition assessment precedes a nutrition diagnosis, intervention (includi ng the care plan), monitoring and evaluation. Three Domains for Nutrition Diagnosis: 1. Intake 2. Clinical 3. Behavioral-environmental In healthcare communities, the terminology under th e intake domain will be used more frequently. The nutrition diagnosis is written in the form of a PES statem ent which is derived from the synthesis of information from the assessment data. (P)Problem ______________related to (E)Etiology ______________as evidenced by (S)Signs/Symptoms_________________________ The Nutrition Care Process: Nutrition Screening and Assessment Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 30 Sample PES statements are on page 63. There may be one or more PES statements. If the patient is stable, a PES statement may not be required. There are six questions to help evaluate the PES statement: 1. Can the dietitian resolve or improve the nutrition diagnosis? 2. Does the nutrition assessment data support the nutriti on diagnosis, etiology, and signs and symptoms? 3. Is the etiology listed the root cause? a. The cause needs to be something that dietitians can change or improve. b. Diabetes is not an etiology as it cannot be changed. 4. Will measuring the signs and symptoms tell if the problem is resolved or improved? 5. Are the signs and symptoms specific enough to measure/eva luate changes at the next visit/next planned evaluation to document resolution or improvement of the nutrition diagnosis? 6. When all things are equal and there is a choice between the PES statement using two nut rition diagnosis labels in different domains, was the diagnosis chosen from the intake domain? Four Domains of Intervention: 1. Food and/or Nutrient Delivery 2. Nutrition Education 3. Nutrition Counseling 4. Coordination of Care In healthcare communities, the intervention terminology under the Food and/ or Nutrient Delivery domain will be used more frequently. Four Domains of Monitoring and Evaluating: 1. Food/Nutrition - Related History 2. Anthropometric Measurements 3. Biochemical Data, Medical Tests, and Procedures 4. Nutrition - Focused Physical Findings In healthcare communities, the mon itoring and evaluation terminology unde r Food/Nutrition Related History and Anthropometric Measurements is likel y to be used more frequently. In-depth information on NCP is available onlin e at the ADA website www.eatright.org and in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association . (See reference at end of this section.) NCP and Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) The NCP and MNT are not synonymous terms. MNT is one type of nutrition care, whereas the NCP describes the approach to a spectrum of nutrition care. The NCP de fines specific steps an RD uses when providing MNT. NCP in Skilled Nursing Facilities The steps of the NCP work well with th e provision of care practices used by skilled nursing facilities, as well as, the directives in Medicare regulations. To complete the MDS, all disciplines complete: an initial assessment, Triggers and Resident Assessment Protocols (RAPS), care planning with interventions, monitoring, eval uation and re-assessment as needed, essentially the same steps used in the NCP. NCP Terminology is found in the International Dietetics & Nutrition Terminology (IDNT) Reference Manual ; American Dietetic Association, 2009. References 1.

Emphasis in this chapter will be placed on the most common medical conditions seen in institutional care and on specific populations DIABETES Diabetes Mellitus is defined as a state of chronic hyperglycemia resulting from a l ack of insulin or a resistance to the action of insulin. Current criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes is outlined below. Criteria for the Diagnosis of Diabetes Blood Test Normoglycemia Pre-Diabetes (IFG or IGT*) Diabetes** Fasting Plasma 126 mg/dl 2-hour Postload Glucose 140 and < 200 mg/dl (IGT) > 200 mg/dl Casual Blood Glucose > 200 mg/dl with symptoms of diabetes * IFG - Impaired Fasting Glucose, IGT - Impaired Glucose Tolerance **In the absence of unequivocal hyperglycemia, a diagnosis of diabetes must be confirmed, on a subsequent day, by measurement of FPG, 2-hr PG, or random plasma glucose (if symptoms are present). The FPG is greatly preferred because of ease of administration, convenience, acceptability to patients, and lower cost. Fasting is defined as no caloric intake for at least 8 hours. The PG test requires the use of a glucose load containing the equi valent of 75 grams anhydrous glucose dissolved in water. Reference: American Diabetic Associ ation. Clinical Practice Recommendations. Diabetes Care, 28 (suppl 1), S37, January, 2005. Diagnosis of Impaired Glucose Tolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Pre-Diabetes Diabetes Mellitus Fasting Plasma Glucose* > 110-125 126 mg/dL Casual Blood Glucose** > 200 mg/dL plus symptoms of diabetes such as polyuria, pol ydispsia, unexplained weight loss Oral glucose tolerance test*** 140-199 mg/dL > 200 mg/dL *no caloric intake for > 8 hours ** that taken at any time of the day without regard to time since last meal. *** Plasma glucose 2 h after 75-g test dose; test less commonly used in clinical practice.

Patients with co-morbid diseases, the very young, older adults and ot hers with unusual conditions or circum stances may require different goals. Measurement of capillary blood glucose fro m finger sticks, however, many glucose me ters convert the test into plasma glucose values. Plasma is more concentrated in gluc ose than whole blood and the reading is ~15% higher. Values calibrated to plasma glucose drawn from a vein. Most of the newer meters and test strips are calibrated to yield a plasma glucose value. The box of strips should note if the strip values are for blood glucose or plasma glucose. Postprandial glucose measurements should be taken 1-2 hr afte r the beginning of the meal (generally peak level times) ** HbA1c is the average blood glucose over a 3 month period.

Liberalizing Diets in Long Term Care The American Dietetic Association Position Paper on Liberali zation of the Diet Prescription Improves Quality of Life for Older Adults in Long-Term Care strongly emphasizes the impor tance of a well balanced, adequate diet. The emphasis should be placed on a well balanced diet instead of a restrict ed calorie diet for those indi viduals in institutionalized settings. Pressure ulcers, weight loss and abnormal laboratory values are common in many of these individuals. The dietitian is the primary source for progressive nutrition in formation and intervention to improve quality of life. Resources for Diabetes: 1. American Diabetes Asso ciation.

Position of the American Dietetic Association: Liberaliza tion of the Diet Prescription Improves Quality of Life for Older Adults in Long-Term Care, Journal of the Ameri can Dietetic Association, 2005, pages 1955 to as dysphagia, can occur at any age as a result of various medical conditions including: Cerebrovascular accident (CVA) Cancer with associated radiation and/or chemotherapy treatment Dementia Head injury or severe trauma Medications Neuromuscular disorders (Multiple sclerosis, Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease, etc.) Scleroderma Xerostomia Dysphagia can result in serious health consequences as it interfe res with adequate nutrition and hydration. In some cases, dysphagia can cause aspiration leading to choking episodes, s hortness of breath and physical discomfort. Aspiration may lead to pneumonia which can be fatal. Normal swallowing has 4 phases 1. Anticipatory - salivation occurs; decisions are made re garding the type, rate, and size of bite, voluntarily controlled 2. Oral stage - consists of preparatory phase in which food is chewed and formed into a bolus and lingual phase in which the tongue moves the bolus to the back of the mouth, both phases are voluntarily controlled 3. Pharyngeal state - airway is protected as bolus m oved past the pharynx and into the esophagus, involuntary control 4. Esophageal stage - the bolus passes through the esopha gus and into the stomach, involuntary control Dysphagia problems may be localized into one or more area s: the oral cavity, the pharyngeal region and the esophagus. Dysphagia may encompass more than one area, such as oropharyngeal. Oral Dysphagia Includes weak tongue and lip muscles, difficulty propelling food to th e throat, difficulty initiating a swallow. Signs of Oral Dysphagia Drooling Spillage of food or liquid from the mouth Slow eating Inability to complete meal due to weakness or fatigue Pocketing food in the mouth Repetitive rocking of tongue from front to back Specific Medical Conditions Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 44 Pharyngeal Dysphagia Includes delayed swallow reflex, swallow does not clear bol us from the throat; bolus may penetrate the larynx causing aspiration. Signs of Pharyngeal Dysphagia Repeated swallowing Frequent throat clearing Wet sounding voice Complaints of food or liquid stuck in the throat Coughing before, during or after swallowing food, liquids or medications Repeated pneumonia Increased temperature Chest/lung congestion Esophageal Dysphagia Includes structural blockages, stenosis, strictures due to GERD, esophageal dysmotility. Signs of Esophageal Dysphagia Pressure or discomfort in the chest Lump or fullness in the throat Chronic heartburn When any of these signs and symptoms are observed, an initial assessment for oral-motor skills during mealtime is necessary. Follow-up mealtime assessment is also needed to monitor appropriateness of diet modification, client's intake, and assistance offered to client on ce dysphagia is diagnosed and treated. The Speech Language Pathologist (SLP) will provide an indi vidualized client assessment based on bedside evaluation, barium swallow and/or video fluoroscopy of swallowing. Based on the assessment, the SLP and RD will collaborate on diet recommendations. The healthcare team will then develop an interdisciplinary plan of care. To minimize swallowing problems, and maximize nutrition, h ydration and quality of life for the client consider the following: General Guidelines for positioning a client with a swallowing problem: Feet flat on the floor Hips and knees at 90\u00ba angles with hips to the back of chair Head tipped slightly forward; lowering chin to chest Table close to body with approximately 12 inches from plate to mouth Elbows supported on chair or table surface Calm environment (no loud music or TV , increased traffic in dining area) Nutrition Care Plan will be developed based on: Recommendations from the SLP regarding food consistency and feeding techniques Client's nutrient requirements Client's food preferences Other medical, psychological or social factors affecting the client's eating Treatment Goals will be individualized with timely reass essments of the plan of care including: Compensatory activities : compensation for a deficit such as ch anges in posture, head position, sensory input, food placement, etc ., used during feeding. Also includes helping devices such as specially designed cups and spoons. Facilitory/therapeutic techniques : designed to improve function and u sed during therapy, such as exercises or cold food items to stimulate swallowing. Dietary modifications: changes in food and/or liquid texture to help compensate for loss of function, to maintain appropriate nutriti onal and hydration status, and prevent to prevent aspiration. These may include temperature changes and order of food/liquid presenta tion changes such as moisten and provide cohesive Specific Medical Conditions Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 45 bolus by adding gravy or sauce . Persons with severe dysphagia ma y require enteral tube feeding for nutrition/hydrati on support. Food Texture Modifications for Dysphagia Clients who have been evaluated for dys phagia usually have specific recommendations related to food and liquid textures, bite size and positioning along with staff procedures to reduce risk of aspiration. There is no uniform standard of care for diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia. Many health car e facilities have developed their own dysphagia texture modification guidelines which should be followe d by practitioners in those facilities. National Dysphagia Diet The National Dysphagia Diet Task Force developed the National Dysphagia Diet ( NDD) as a work toward standardization based on scientific and rheological properties of foods and fl uids. The NDD has not been peer-reviewed or approved by representatives of the American Speech-Language Hearing Association. The NDD guidelines are offered here as an example of a diet th at can be prescribed and prepared to address the needs of dysphagia clients. NDD Level 1: Dysphagia Pureed 1. Pureed, homogenous and cohesive f oods, pudding-like consistency. 2. No coarse textures, raw fruits or vegetables, nuts etc 3. Requires very little chewing ability, used with modera te to severe dysphagia, poor oral phase and reduced ability to protect airway NDD Level 2: Dysphagia Mechanically Altered 1. Cohesive, moist, semisolid, fork-mashable fruits and ve getables, meats are ground or minced no larger than \u00bc inch pieces, includes some mixed textures, excludes most bread product, crackers, and other dry foods 2. Requires some ability to chew, used with mild to m oderate oral and/or pharyngeal dysphagia, assess for tolerance to mixed textures. NDD Level 3: Dysphagia Advanced 1. Soft - solid textured foods, including thin-sliced, tender or ground meat, soft fruits and vegetables, foods need to be moist and in bite-sized pieces, includes mixed textures, excludes hard, crunchy fruits and vegetables, sticky foods, and very dry foods. 2. Requires adequate chewing ability, used as transition to regular diet, adequate dentition is needed, used with mild oral and/or pharyngeal phase dysphagia, assess for tolerance of mixed textures. NDD Level 4: Regular: All foods allowed Standards for Thickened Liquids Many dysphagia clients also benefit from the use of thic kened liquids. Recommendations for thickened liquids are included in swallowing evaluations from SLP. There are no nationally recognized standard s for thickened liquids. Dietetics professionals need to be aware that there is wide variation in viscosity of commercially prepared thickened beverages and many product labels do not include viscosity. Th e use of dry starch thickeners added to thin liquids also results in wide variations in viscosity. The NDD Task Fo rce has suggested the following viscosity borders and ranges: Viscosity Borders and are at Shear Rate of 50 s-1 and 25 C. cP = centipoise, a measurement of the thickness of a liquid Thin Liquids : Includes all unthickened beverages and supplemen ts, clear juices, frozen yogurt, clear liquids, milk, water, tea, coffee, soda, broth, plain gelatin and fruit with thin liquid properties such as watermelon, grapefruit and orange sections, anything that w ill liquefy in the mouth within a few seconds. Specific Medical Conditions Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 46 Nectar-like Liquids : Includes nectars, vegetable juices, chocol ate milk, buttermilk, thin milkshakes, cream soups, gelatin, or other beve rages properly thickened. Honey-like Liquids : thickened to honey consistency Spoon-thick Liquids : thickened to pudding consistency, these pro ducts will have to be eaten with a spoon, pudding, custard, hot cereal Foods that May Cause Choking (Be aware that dentures can make it difficult to tell if food is chewed properly.) Hot dogs & sausages Large pieces of fruit Raw vegetables Corn Chips Chunks of meat Round or hard candy Nuts and seeds Cherries with pits Raisins Marshmallows Peanut butter Popcorn Grapes Fruit seeds Caramels Chewing gum Hamburger Tips to Prevent Choking Change the form - i.e., cut hot dogs into lengthwise pieces; avoid round items that can become lodged easily Cook or mash carrots, corn Spread peanut butter thinly or mix with jelly Cut item into small pieces Eat slowly and chew food well Supervise client while eating Discourage talking while food is in the mouth Position properly: seated upright; prevent tiltin g head backward while eating or drinking References: 1.

The condition results in a loss of dopamine-producing cells in the brain which affects muscle movements of the body. PD can occur at any age; w ith ~15% of cases in those under 60 years of age and 80-85% in those who are 60 years or older. Not everyone will e xperience exactly the same Parkinson's disease symptoms at the same time. The disease can affect everyone very differently an d in some cases it may be many years before there is any disability or significant limitation of daily activities. Physical manifestations of PD include: Slowed movements, rigidity, tremor, gait and balance pr oblems, that disable and escalate as PD advances, raising risk for bone thinning, falls, and fractures. Slowed peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract with delayed colon transit time leading to constipation, hemorrhoids, and fecal impaction. Diminished tongue movement, incomplete lip closur e, weakening of the lower esophageal sphincter, gastroparesis, resulting in difficulty chewing/swallowing, choking, aspiration pneumonia, acid reflux, Barret's esophagus, delayed medication absorp tion, constipation, hemorrhoids. Specific Medical Conditions Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 48 Hoehn and Yahr Stages of PD: The Hoehn and Yahr scale, developed in 196 7, is one method used to measure the degree of disability experienced by Parkinson's patients. This rating system has been largely supplanted by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, which is much more complicated. Hoehn & Yahr Stage Symptoms Related Nutrition Concerns 1 mild, one side only, not disabling, changes in posture, locomotion, facial expression medication-induced nausea, constipation, loss of senses of taste and smell 2 symptoms bilateral; posture and gait affected; minimal disability above, plus unplanned weight loss, gastroparesis / GERD; most will overcome nausea unless new medications are introduced 3 significant slowing of body movements, early impairment of equilibrium on walking or standing; moderately severe generalized dysfunction above, plus may develop dysphagia 4 symptoms severe; walking is limited; rigidity and bradykinesia; unable to live alone above, plus decreased manual dexterity; difficulty self-feeding, dehydration 5 invalidism complete, requires constant nursing care; cachectic stage; cannot stand or walk above, plus may require nutrition support http://neurosurgery.mgh.harvard.edu/Functiona l/pdstages.htm#HoehnandYahr accessed 2-21-05 United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS): Since 1987 the UPDRS has been u sed extensively by clinicians around the world for tracking Parkinson's disease progress and re sponse to therapy. The UPDRS consists of 42 questions and is subdivided into three scales including cognitive and mood aspects, motor aspects, and activities of daily living (ADL). A lower score indicates a better condition than a higher score. The UPDRS is available at www.mdvu.org/library/ratingscales/pd/. Medications Common adverse side effects include: constipation, nau sea, anorexia, confusion, hallucinations (often from overmedication or polypharmacy, especially in older adults), dry mouth, dyskinesia, gastroparesis, GERD, orthostatic hypotension, weakness, fatigue, daytime sleepiness, depression, edema PD medications initially help control symp toms, but with progression to final stages, more medications in greater amounts are needed to combat symptoms. Increased medications bri ng increased risk for adverse effects, including dry mouth, constipation, anorexia, and hallucinations.

Pp 81-82 CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE Chronic Kidney disease (CKD) requires careful nutrition assessment and individualization of nutrition prescription. Residents with CKD benefit from monitoring of complian ce and practicality of nutrition prescription as well as ongoing assessment of nutritional status (outcomes). If the resident is undergoing dialysis, coordi nation of nutritional care should be in conjunction with the dietitian at the dialysis unit. There is evidence that preven tive measures and treatment can prevent or delay some of the adverse outcomes of CKD. (1, 3) While assessing a resident with CKD, consider the followi ng common nutritional complications associated with this disease: Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) . PEM is caused not only by inadequate intake but due to the dialysis procedure, loss of blood, uremia, inflammatory state and protein catabolism. Adequate nutrition is essential for its prevention and treatment. (2, 3) Anemia This nutritional concern affects quality of life yet is often very responsive to treatment. Residents with CKD may develop anemia due to a decrease in EPO production. For further explanation and to view \"Anemia in CKD Decision-Making Algorithm\", visit www.kidney.org/professionals/kis/images/1 Renal osteodystrophy changes in the meta bolism of calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D which results in hyperparathyroidism as outlined below. (3, 4) Renal Osteodystrophy As kidney function decreases, the kidney loses its ability to activate Vitamin D and may cause calcium and phosphorus to get out of balance. As calcium, phosphorus, imbalance progresses, parathyroid hormone (PTH) is released and causes calcium to leach from the bones to supply calcium to the blood. This may lead to weak bones and/or calcification of the soft tissues. To prevent this, most residents require a low phosphorus diet, and or/phosphate binding medication. Active form of vitamin D may also need to be given. (usually as part of HD treatment) Chronic Kidney Disease Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 51 Electrolyte and fluid balance Control of hypertension, fluid balance and electrolytes can be challenging. Diet interventions are almost always required and shou ld be coordinated with the health care team. Additional Risks Residents with CKD often have elevated lipid levels, hypertension and are at increased risk to develop cardiovascular disease. Please also see the section on Diabetes and CKD (see page ). CKD Classification and Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) The best indicator of renal function is glomerular filtrati on rate (GFR). If GFR is not available, an estimate may be calculated using the blood creatinine level, age, gender, race and weight. (See Table 1.) An online calculator of GFR is available at www.kidney.org/kls/professionals/gfr_calculator.cfm Table 1: Cockraft-Gault Equation (5) The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcome Qualit y Initiative (NKF KOQI) has classified each stage of CKD based on GFR as seen in Table 2. It has been shown that appropriate interventions can prevent the advancement of CKD. Therefore, it is important to identify the stage of CKD when assessing nutritional status, determining nutrition prescription and when monitoring effectiveness of interventions. Table 2: Classification of CKD GFR (mL/min/1.73m2) Description Action * At increased risk > 90 Risk factors present; without markers of kidney damage Periodically test for CKD; treat changeable risk factors Stage 1 > 90 Kidney damage; normal or increased GFR Diagnose and treat type Treat comorbid conditions Progression - slow Treat changeable risk factors Restage occasionally Stage 2 60-89 Kidney damage; mild reduction of GFR Adjust medication dosages for GFR Stage 3 30-59 Kidney damage; moderate reduction of GFR Assess for and treat complications Avoid nephrotoxic drugs Stage 4 15-29 Kidney damage; severe reduction of GFR Prepare for kidney replacement therapy Dialysis Stage 5 <15 or on dialysis Kidney failure Begin kidney replacement therapy when uremia is present * Action for all stages should include actions from previous stages Adapted from National Kidney Foundation K/DOQI Clinical Practice Guidelin es for Chronic Kidney Disease: Evaluation, Classification and Stratification .

Chronic Kidney Disease Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 52 Nutrition Assessment in CKD Determining body weight for nutrient calculations. KD OQI Clinical Practice Guidelines for Nutrition in CRF recommends using standard and adjusted body weight, refe rring to NHANES II, when calculating nutrient levels. For residents between 95-115% of the SBW or if they are at th eir BMI weight goal, actual edema free weight may be used. (#5, Page 1-23; #2, guideline 12). BMI goal weight can also be used to estimate nutrient needs for those who are outside the desired weight goal. 1. Determine body weight using \"standard body weight\"; refer to NHANES II data. 2. Use \"adjusted body weight\" for obese or lean resident s who are <95% or > 115% of standard body weight. Adjusted body (BW) BW +{(standard BW (page 1-23) Actual BW 80, standard BW 60; = 80 + {(60-80) x .025} Adjusted BW = 80 + {-20 x 0.25} Adjusted BW = 80 - 5 or 75 3. BMI: KDOQI recommendations are 23.6 for women and 24.0 for men and are associated with increased survival in HD patients By comparing the BMI ranges with the norma l adult weight, a realistic weight to base nutritional needs can be determined. (#2,#3,#4) a. Calculate desirable body weight from BMI (see table) *needs one page b. Upper 50 th percentile BMI may be best for survival in maintenance dialysis (MD) residents. Further studies are needed to determine the safety of weight loss for residents with BMI > 30.

Chronic Kidney Disease Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 53 Determining the Nutrition Prescription MNT for Extended Care Residents with CKD Whether a resident has early CKD or is on dialysis, older a dults pose special nutritional issues. Protecting the resident from hyperkalemia or fluid overload whil e providing adequate calories and protein to prevent protein energy malnutrition is a challenge. The diet order should be individualized with th e least amount of restrictions yet effective to prevent further renal impairment. The diet order may onl y have some of the restrictions liste d in Table 3. Considerations when determining the diet order include: HD (hemodialysis) residents have an increased need fo r protein and require a s odium, phosphorus, potassium and fluid restriction. PD (peritoneal) residents require an increase need for prot ein and require sodium and p hosphorus restrictions; but often allowed a more liberal potassium restriction.

Diabetes and CKD Diabetes is one of the leading causes of CKD. Adequate nut ritional management may reduce the progression of the CKD. The amount and quality of dietary protein, carbohydrate and fats should be considered. Ev idence has shown that limiting dietary protein can slow the progression of abluminuria and CKD.

New dialysis patients may not recognize sympto ms of hypoglycemia. Facility staff needs to be alert and monitor blood sugar regularly. Check fac ility protocol on monitoring and treating of low blood glucose levels and assess need for resident education. Examples of 15 grams of CHO exchange that are low in potassium: a. \u00bd to 1 cup regular soda pop - 7 UP, ginger ale, etc. b. \u00bd cup apple juice, cranberry, or grape juice (not orange) c. 3 sugar cubes or 3 packets of sugar d. 3 glucose tablets e. 1 tube Gluctose 15 or glucose gel f. Avoid using high potassium foods!! g. Remember to give Phosphate binder (i.e., Tums \u00ae, PhosLo\u00ae, Renagel) as prescribed since these are needed whenever food (protein in particular) is consumed Do Not use orange juice or Gatorade\u00ae due to high potassium levels Do Not use milk, yogurt, or cheese products due to high potassium and high phosphorus levels NOTE: Residents on Precose\u00ae must be treated with glucose. Precose\u00ae inhibits the breakdown of sugar to glucose and slows absorption of sucrose or fructose. (#5) Common Medications in CKD The actions of medications and herbal su pplements may be altered in CKD because of impaired urinary excretion. All of these medications have the potential to interact with each othe r. Many side effects of these medications can interfere with nutritional intake and nutrient adequacy. (#5) 1. Renal Vitamins a. Renal patients are to avoid \"house\" or one-a-day type vitamin/ mineral supplements due to high content of fat soluble vitamins and minerals with potentia l for toxicity or overload. (Vitamins A, D, K, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium) b. Nephrocaps, Renaltab, Dialyvite\u00ae Chronic Kidney Disease Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 56 2. Phosphate Binders PhosLo\u00ae, Renagel (slowly being replaced by Renzela, due to less GI side effects) and Fosrenol\u00ae (now approved to be crushed) are commonly used phosphate binders. They mu st be taken with meals and snacks to be effective, ideally given when tray is passed. Check w ith nursing to assure proper administration. 3. Be Alert! Check the Medication Administration Record (MAR)! Dialysis patients are not to be given Milk of Magnesia, Citracal \u00ae or calcium citrate, PeptoBismol\u00ae, calcium or aluminum based antacids (Amphogel\u00ae) unless specifically ordered by the Nephrologist. Usually renal patien ts are taken off Lasix, Bumex\u00ae or other diuretics when starting HD. The RD can be very helpful in alerting the physician if any of these meds still on the MAR. 4. Herbal supplements in CKD: Herbal supplements can interact with many drugs and may be contraindicated in CKD. Below is a partial listing of common herbal supp lements and their potential affects. As part of the assessment process, determine if any herbal supplements are being used. Each herbal supplement should be assessed fully by the health care team to determ ine if it is beneficial or contraindicated. Can affect potassium levels: Alfalfa, Dandelion, berries, and Parsley, Can affect blood thinning agents: Garlic, and Ginger. Do not use in CKD: Ginseng.

National Kidney Foundation, New York, NY. 2009. \u00a9 National Kidney Foundation General Dietary Guidelines for Planning Nutrition Prescriptions 1. For residents not on dialysis, whose intake/appetite is ad equate, a general No added sa lt diet with avoidance of salty meats/foods may be adequate. Additional restricti ons of protein may be indicated as noted in previous charts. Monitor potassium and phosphorus levels for need of restrictions. When initiating additional dietary restrictions, begin slowly and monitor adherence for best compliance. 2. If a resident's intake is poor and is not on dialysis, a more liberal diet approach is appropriate. Individualize nutrition prescription, provide supplementation as indicated , and monitor lab values. If intake improves, re- evaluate. 3. For residents on dialysis, additional restrictions of potassium, phosphorus and fluid are most likely needed. However, protein needs are increased. Refer to followi ng tables as a guide when potassium or phosphorus is limited. Also, consult the facility's diet ma nual for diet order language and content. Additional Notes for residents on dialysis 1. Bag Lunch/Snack Guidelines Most dialysis units prefer residents to have a snack or meal before going for their scheduled time for dialysis. Eating during dialysis treatment can lead to lower blood pressure and can increase risk of choking. However, standard practices can vary from one dialysis center to a nother. It is important for the dietitian to communicate with the dialysis unit team's dietitia n to determine how to meet the resi dent's nutritional needs, especially on dialysis days. Residents may need to be sent with a light snack or can of approved supplement if instructed. Additionally, ongoing communication with the multidisciplin ary team at the facility will assure consumption and practicality of the nutritional plan. Consider: Communicate and document dialysis day meal changes Consider how to provide foods needed at unusual tim es (cold cereal and bread to toast for early breakfast) Observe individual fluid restrictions as per schedule and diet order. If food is required to be sent, use an insulated food carrier and properly package food to ensure freshness and food safety. 2.

Ren Fail. 2009;31(3):239-45. Review. THE VENTILATOR DEPENDENT PATIENT Respiratory distress is a condition in which the patient suffers from a deficit in the body's overall oxygen content and / or a decrease in alveolar ventilation, which results in the re tention of carbon dioxide. These abnormalities (whether existing alone or concurrently) can also cause profound changes in the patient's acid-base balance. Untreated or unsuccessfully treated respiratory distress will ultimately result in respirat ory failure, which represents a potentially fatal triad of hypox ia (O2 lack), hypercarbia (CO 2 retention), and respiratory acidosis (increas ed blood carbonic acid levels). Therefore the patient in clinically observed respiratory distress or respir atory failure requires careful evaluation by the registered dietitian. In a patient with these types of respiratory comp romise, excessive caloric oxidation of carbohydrate calories may lead to artificially increased carbon dioxide production and possible acidemia. (pH < 7.35) The treatment of choice for respiratory insufficiency and failure is generally mechanical ventilation. Mechanical ventilation provides the physiologic support to help th e patient achieve temporary homeostatic levels of O 2, CO 2, and pH while the underlying pathology is id entified, treated, and reversed. Patients on mechanical ventilation may not able to eat by the normal oral route. For those requiring ventilator support for less than 48 hours this lack of nutrients usually is not a c oncern. For those requiring more than 48 hours or long term ventilator support an alternate form of nutrition support such as enteral or TPN may be needed. Disease states associated with respiratory failure are characterized by a hypermeta bolic response with increased resting energy expenditure and increased protein catabolism. It is important to supply nut rition support as early as possible to prevent the loss of lean body mass and to supply adequate energy for metabolic support. (3) Potential problems during mechanical ventilation may include the following: CO2 retention with respiratory acidemia Hypoxia with increased lactic acid tissue levels Delayed weaning Refeeding syndrome Liver dysfunction Cardiac dysfunction Malnutrition Hyperglycemia Renal insufficiency or failure with azotemia Lipemic serum Primary and accessory respiratory muscle wasting Successful feeding of the mechanically ven tilated patient must mirror the physiologic status of the patient as well as the stage they currently occupy in the mechanical ventilation timeline. This timeline begins with the acute initiation phase when the patient is first placed on the ventilator and ends when the postweaning phase marks the complete independence of the patient from ventilator. Ventilator Dependency Feeding Stages: 1. Acute repletion : replenish muscle glycogen stores and reverse catabolism. 2. Pre weaning : maintain positive nitrogen balance, improve vi sceral protein stores and promote weight gain. 3. Weaning : provide extra energy substrates to meet the in creased metabolic requirements of both primary and accessory respiratory musculature and attempt to minimize increased CO 2 production by avoiding large carbohydrate components in the patient dietary intake. Specific Medical Conditions Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 60 4. Postweaning: maintain nutrient needs despite anorexia or dysphagia; support anabolism. Carefully evaluate daily caloric needs, and readjust them as the patie nt's rehabilitation becomes more and more intense and energy demanding. A planned feeding strategy should be in itiated as soon as the patient's condition is stable enough to support effective nutritional intervention. The postweaning nutr itional planning must begin as soon as th e patient is placed on the ventilator. Early feedings should be limited in sc ope and volume, but may emphasize dextrose and fat calories as an option to reduce CO 2 production. As a caution, however, each ventilator patient requires individual care planning as the presenting factors vary widely from patient to patient. For example, dext rose and fat calorie substitution may be very helpful during repletion or when patient is temporarily failing weaning a ttempts, but may not be the most appropriate therapy during other feeding stages. Nutrient Requirements (1) Calories: Caloric needs may be estimated several ways. When de termining calories, total calories must be taken into consideration (i.e., protein, fat, and carboh ydrate). Indirect calorimetry is th e standard for determination of resting metabolic rate. When indirect calorimetry cannot be perfo rmed, predictive formulas may be necessary. Some of the various methods for calculating energy needs are: Maintenance: 1.0 - 1.2 x REE or 25 - 35 kCal/kg/day Anabolism: 1.4 - 1.6 x REE or 35 - 45 kCal/kg/day BEE x activity factor x injury factor Ireton-Jones Energy Equation Spontaneously breathing patients: EEE(s) + 244(S) + 238(T) - 804(B) Whereas EEE = Estimated Energy Expenditure (kCal/day) A = Age (years) W = body weight (kg) O = obesity (present = 1, absent =0) S = Sex (male = 1, female = 0) T = diagnosis of trauma (present = 1, absent = 0) B = diagnosis of burn (present = 1, absent - 0) Protein: Metabolic rate, body protein reserves, calorie intake, nutritional status a nd age must be considered when estimating protein needs. The following are guidelines for estimating protein requirements: 1.2 - 1.6 gm protein/kg body weight for maintenance 1.6 - 2.0 gm protein/kg body weight for repletion Adjust for renal and liver dysfunction as appropriate Lipids: Fat solutions are calorically dense, isotonic solutions. They are available in either 10 or 20 % solutions and may be given through central or peripheral veins. Fo r best utilization, lipids should be infused along with carbohydrates and protein. 30 - 50% kCal as lipids (lipids not to exceed 2.5 g/kg) Adjust for propofol sedative because of decreased energy expenditure overall due to the sedative component. Carbohydrates: Carbon dioxide production and oxyg en consumption may be increased by high carbohydrate loads which can or may lead to respiratory distress. Repl acing part of the carbohydrate calories with fat may decrease CO 2 production by lowering the respiratory quotient. 35 - 50% kCal as CHO Monitoring: It is extremely important to understand all aspects of fluid balance and imbalance; this includes both arterial blood gases as well as selected types of electrolytes. Specific Medical Conditions Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 61 The ability to modify blood gas values is dependent on: Ventilatory (air moving) ability of the lungs Diffusion of respiratory gases (O 2 & CO 2) across the alveolar-capillary membrane into the blood Absorption and transport of O 2 by hemoglobin and plasma to and from tissue Uptake and utilization of O 2 and production and remova l of CO2 by cells These functions are all made possible or impossible by nutritional elements or lack of them. It is also important to monitor relevant electrolyte levels Phosphorus - abnormal levels affect delivery of oxy gen to tissues and contractility of diaphragm muscle Magnesium - deficiency affects respiratory muscle strength Hypocalcemia is associated with decreased diaphragmatic function Sodium depletion leads to appetite depression and then slowing of the ventilatory drive Arterial Blood Gases Because blood gas values can be affected by various nutritio nal elements, the dietitian should have at least a general understanding of the blood gases. The meas ure of acidity and alkalinity is pH. The lower the pH, the higher the acidity of the substance being measured. Conversely, the higher the pH, the higher the alkalinity of the substance being measured. PaCO 2 is a measure of ventilatory function. For example, muscle weakening caused by lack of potassium would cause ventilation to decrease and PaCO 2 will rise. Elevated PaCO 2 levels are treated by increasing the patient's ventilatory level. PaO 2 is primarily a measure of environmental levels of inha led and blood borne oxygen. Lo w oxygen levels are treated by administration of oxygen to the patient. HCO 3 and H 2CO 3 are a major buffer system [20 parts of bicarbonate (HCO 3) to one part of carbonic acid H2CO 3)] The bicarbonate retention/excretion is controlled by the kidneys and is an alkaline substance (pH > 7.45). Carbonic acid is formed by the mixture of CO 2 and water. It is an acidic substance (pH< 7.35) and is formed in proportion to the efficiency of ventilation (higher PaCO 2 equals more carbonic acid) Therefore, the mo re bicarbonate, the more alkaline the pH; and the more carbonic acid, the more acidic the pH. The pH of th e blood is constantly balanced by both the kidneys and the lungs. SaO 2 is a measurement of the relative saturation of hemoglobin w ith oxygen and is not always perfectly predictive of core oxygen content and should be viewed only as re ference of limited value to the dietitian. Normal Values for Arterial Blood Gases pH: 7.35 - 7.45 PaCO 2: 35 - 45 mm Hg PaO 2: 80 - 100 mm Hg HCO 3: 22 - 26 mEq/L H 2CO 3: 1.2 mEq/L SaO 2: 96 - 98% Arterial blood gases measure the status of the body's respirat ory environment. Acid base im balance results when either bicarbonate or carbonic acid is increased or decreased. There ar e four primary acid-base HCO 3 Alkalosis HC0 3 = 36 mEq/L 1.2 Ratio = 30:1 7.58 Respiratory Acidosis HCO 3 = 24 = 21 mEq/L H2CO 3 = 0.6 Ratio 40:1 7.7 Specific Populations Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 2009 DHCC 62 Respiratory Quotient (RQs) Of Various Substrates/Conditions RQ is the ratio of CO 2 expired to O 2 inspired (VCO 2/VO 2). Maintain RQ of < 0.85. Variations in the RQ may reflect over or underfeeding or inappropriate nutrient mix. Seriously ill patients may have a decreased ability to utilize carbohydrates. To avoid an increase in CO 2 production, excess calories and high carbohydrate load may need to be avoided. However, the clinical utility of using RQ to determine substrate metabo lism has been shown to not be as reliable a marker of over or underfeeding as originally thought. (2) . Substrate/Condition RQ Ethanol unequilibrated) Prolonged ketosis 0.68 Goals for Nutrition Support in the Ventilator Dependent Patient 1. Provide adequate calories and protein and avoid overfeeding and underfeeding. 2. Replete electrolytes, especially PO 4, Mg, Ca, K. 3. Prevent overfeeding as excess kCal and/or high CHO formulas may contribute to CO 2 retention and should be avoided. 4. Determine needs using indirect calorimetry providi ng a measure of a patient's REE (resting energy expenditure including stress) and the RQ (see above regarding RQ) 5. Maintain RQ of < 0.85. Higher RQ may indicate ove rfeeding or excess CHO in nutritional support formula. 6. Reduce CO 2 production up to 50% if non-protein kCal may be provided as fat.

Abdominal cramps and diarrhea. Diarrhea, caused by the laxative effect, can decrease th e absorption of many drugs. Preliminary studies suggest aloe may lower blood glucose levels, so individuals usi ng glucose lower medication should be cautious. Asian Ginseng To support overall health and boost the immune system. Lower blood glucose Control blood pressure. Some studies show Asian ginseng may lower blood glucose and indicate potentially positive effects on immune function. Research results are not conclusive enough to prove health claims associated with the herb. Some sources suggest that use be limited to 3 months because of concerns of side effects. Headaches, sleep, gastrointes tinal problems, allergic reactions, breast tenderness, menstrual irregularities, high blood pressure. Preliminary studies suggest ginseng may lower blood glucose levels, so individuals using glucose lower medication should be cautious. Bilberry The fruit is used to treat diarrhea, menstrual cramps, eye problems, varicose veins, and other circulatory problems. The leaf is sometimes used for diabetes. There is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of bilberry fruit or leaf for any health conditions High doses of the leaf or leaf extract are considered unsafe due to possible toxic side effects. Bitter Orange Heartburn Loss of appetite Nasal congestion Weight loss. There is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of bitter orange for health purposes. Bitter orange contains the chemical synephrine, which is similar to the main chemical in ephedra. The USDA banned ephedra due to serious side effects; it is unclear if bitter orange has similar effects. There is little evidence that it is safer to use than ephedra. Use may speed up the heart rate and raise blood pressure. Some reported side effects include fainting, heart attack, and stroke. People should avoid taking bitte r orange supplements if they have a heart condition or high blood pressure, or if they are taking medications (such as MAO inhibitors), caffeine, or other herbs/supplements that speed up the heart rate. Cat's Claw To support treatment for a variety of health conditions, including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, viral infections, and arthritis. To support the immune system and promote kidney health There is not enough scientific evidence to determine whether cat's claw works for any of the indicated uses. Small studies show a possible benefit in arthritis. It has not been proven to boost the immune system. Additional studies may point to new avenues for research in Alzheimer's disease treatment. Only rare and mild side effects are reported and may include headaches, dizziness, and vomiting. Pregnant women should avoid using it due to its past use for preventing and aborting pregnancy. Cat's claw may stimulate the immune system, therefore it is unclear whether it is safe for people with conditions affecting the immune system. Cranberry To prevent or treat urinary tract infections or Helicobacter pylori infections that can lead to stomach ulcers. Cranberry has also been reported to have antioxidant and anticancer activity. Cranberry components may prevent bacteria, such as E. coli, from clinging to the cells of the urinary tract and causing infection. Drinking excessive amounts of juice could cause gastrointestinal irritation or diarrhea Echinacea To help fight infections by stimulating the immune system. Some studies have shown that it may be beneficial in treating upper respiratory infecti ons, but results are mixed. There is no significant data to support use for prevention of infections. Gastrointestinal side effects were reported in clinical trials. Allergic reaction (i.e., rash, asthma, and anaphylaxis) occurs in some users. Allerg ic reaction is more likely for those that have asthma or are a llergic to plants in the daisy family (including ragweed). Fenugreek To stimulate milk production in breastfeeding women, lower blood sugar and stimulate appetite. A few studies demonstrated that fenugreek may help lower blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. There is not enough scientific evidence to support the other indicated uses. Side effects when taken by mouth may include gas, bloating and diarrhea. Medications Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 81 Herb (Common Name) Commonly Used For What the Science Says Potential Health Issues and Side Effects Feverfew To treat migraine headaches and rheumatoid arthritis. Feverfew has also been used for nausea, vomiting, psoriasis, allergies, asthma, tinnitus and dizziness. Some studies suggest that feverfew may help in preventing migraine headaches. There is not enough scientific evidence to support the other indicated uses. Side effects can include canker sores, swelling and irritation of the lips and tongue, loss of taste, nausea, digestive problems, and bloating. Pregnant women should not use feverfew because it may increase the risk of miscarriage or premature delivery. Those who are allergic to the daisy family (including ragweed and chrysanthemums) are more likely to be allergic to feverfew. Flaxseed and Flaxseed Oil Flaxseed is most commonly used as a laxative. Other uses include for hot flashes and breast pain Flaxseed oil is most commonly used to for relief of arthritis symptoms. Flaxseed and flaxseed oil have been used to treat high cholesterol levels and to prevent cancer. Flaxseed contains soluble fiber and is proven to act as an effective laxative. Research on flaxseed effectiveness to lower cholesterol levels report mixed results. Flaxseed and flaxseed oil supplements ha ve very few reported side effects. Use of flaxseed without appropriate water intake could worsen constipation. High fiber content in flaxseed may lower the body's ability to absorb oral medications. Garlic Most commonly used for high cholesterol, heart disease, and high blood pressure. Also used to prevent certain types of cancer, including stomach and colon cancers. Limited evidence shows garlic can slightly lower blood cholesterol, slightly lower blood pressure, slow development of atherosclerosis, and may reduce risk of stomach cancer, but results are inconclusive. Only minor side effects reported, including breath and body odor, heartburn, upset stomach, and allergic reactions. The blood thinning effect of garlic contraindicates use before, during or after surgery. Ginger To treat nausea, stomach aches, and diarrhea To treat symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and joint and muscle pain. Studies are mixed on whether it is effective for nausea caused by motion, chemotherapy, or surgery, however there some studies do show that short- term use can safely relieve pregnancy- related nausea and vomiting. Effectiveness on the other listed uses in unclear. Most commonly reported side e ffects include gas, bloating, heartburn, and nausea (most often associated with powdered ginger). Ginkgo To improve memory and to treat or prevent dementia To decrease intermittent claudication (leg pain caused by narrowing arteries); and to treat sexual dysfunction, multiple sclerosis, tinnitus, and other health conditions. Some promising results have been seen for intermittent claudication. Studies are inconclusive on its effectiveness in improving memory and lowering the overall incidence of dementia. Uncooked ginkgo seeds can cause seizures. Consuming large quantities of seeds over time can cause death. Most common side effects include gastrointestinal side effects, headache, dizziness, and allergic skin reactions. Severe allergic reaction is a less commonly reported side effect. Some research shows increas ed bleeding risk, therefore people who take anticoagul ant drugs, have bleeding disorders, or have scheduled surgery or dental procedures should use caution. Green Tea Green tea has been used to prevent and treat a variety of cancers, including breast, stomach, and skin cancers. Green tea has also b een used to lower cholesterol levels, aid in weight loss, improve mental alertness, and protect skin from sun damage. Studies show green tea may help protect against or slow the growth of certain cancers, but show mixed results. Green tea is generally safe for adults in moderate amounts. Caffeine in green tea and green tea extracts can cause insomnia, anxiety, irritability, upset stomach, nausea, diarrhea, or frequent urination in some people. Vitamin K content of green tea can make anticoagulant drugs less effective. Concentrated extracts could exacerbate liver problems. Discontinue use and consult a heath care practitioner if they have a liver disorder or develop symptoms of liver trouble, such as abdominal pain, dark urine, or jaundice. Hoodia To suppress the appetite for weight loss. There is no reliable research to support use. Unknown (not studied) Medications Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 82 Herb (Common Name) Commonly Used For What the Science Says Potential Health Issues and Side Effects Licorice Root To treat stomach ulcers, bronchitis, and sore throat, as well as infections caused by viruses, such as hepatitis. Limited reliable information availa ble. People with heart disease or high blood pressure should be cautious. In large amounts, licorice containing glycyrrhizin can cause high blood pressure, salt and water retention, and low potassium levels. Large doses can also affect the body's levels of cortisol. Licorice ta ken with diuretics could cause dangerously low potassium levels. Pregnant women should avoid using licorice as some research suggests it could increase the risk of preterm labor. The safety of long term use has not been thoroughly studied. Milk Thistle To treat liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, and gallbladder disorders. To lower cholesterol levels. To reducing insulin resistance in people with type 2 diabetes who also have cirrhosis To reduce the growth of cancer cells in breast, cervical, and prostate cancers Some promising data have been reported for use of milk thistle on liver disease, however results are mixed. Clinical trials show few minor gastrointestinal side effects. People who are allergic to plants in the Milk Thistle family (i.e., ragweed, chrysanthemum, marigold, and daisy) are more prone to allergic reaction. Noni As a general health tonic. To treat cancer and chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Noni has not been well studied in people for any health condition. Noni is high in potassium. Some users have reported liver damage. People with kidney issu es should avoid using noni. Its safety has not been adequately studied. Peppermint Oil To treat nausea, indigestion, cold symptoms, headaches, muscle/nerve pain, and stomach and bowel conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome. Several studies show it may improve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Other studies show promising results with additional health conditions; however there is not enough scientific evidence to support the use. Use is safe in small doses. Possible side effects include allergic reactions and heartburn. Soy To prevent or treat a variety of health conditions, including high cholesterol levels, menopausal symptoms, osteoporosis, memory problems, high blood pressure, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Some studies indicate daily intake of soy protein may slightly lower levels of LDL cholesterol. Some studies show soy isoflavone supplements may reduce hot flashes after menopause, results have been inconsistent. There is not enough scientific evidence to support the use of soy for other uses. Soy foods or short term use of soy as a dietary supplement is considered safe for most people. Minor side effects include gastro intestinal issues. Allergic reaction can occur on rare occasion. Studies show no effect of dietary soy on risk for endometrial hyperplasia. The potential role of soy in br east cancer risk is uncertain. Women who have or who are at increased risk of developing breast cancer or other hormone-sensitive conditions (such as ovarian or uterine cancer) should be particularly careful about using soy until more is known about its effect on estrogen levels. Medications Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 83 Herb (Common Name) Commonly Used For What the Science Says Potential Health Issues and Side Effects St. John's Wort To help treat sleep disorders, depression, and anxiety St. John's wort has been used for centuries to treat mental disorders and nerve pain. St. John's wort has also been used as a sedative and a treatment for malaria, as well as a balm for wounds, burns, and insect bites. Today, St. John's wort is used by some for depression, anxiety, and/or sleep disorders. Some research supports usefulness in treating moderate depression. It is not a proven therapy for depression. Side effects can include anxi ety, dry mouth, dizziness, gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, headache, sexual dysfunction, sensitivity to sunlight. Research shows that use may speed or slow several medical drug's breakdown, with serious side effects. See http://nccam.nih.gov/health/stjohnswort/ataglance.htm for a list of drugs. When combined with certain antidepressants, St. John's wort may increase side effects such as nausea, anxiety, headache, and confusion. St. John's wort is not a proven therapy for depression. If depression is not adequately treated, it can become severe. Anyone who may have depression should see a health care provider. There are effective proven therapies available. Tell your health care providers about any complementary and alternative practices you use. Give them a full picture of what you do to manage your health. This will help en sure coordinated and safe care. To ensure safety and coordination of treatment, those using alte rnative medicine should discuss all personal practices with the ir health care providers. References: 1.

The route of administration depends on the length of therapy, nutrient requirements, available intravenous access and fluid requirements. Parenteral nutrition may be in fused via central venous access (primary indications include: chemotherapy, antibiotic administration or TPN) or via peri pheral catheters (including midclavicular cathe ters). Peripheral venous catheters are best when patients with normal renal function need short-term access ( 10-14 days). However, midclavicular cat heters can be used for 2-3 months. PN solutions that are infused via central venous access ar e generally dextrose based whereas solutions that are peripherally infused are lipid based. Dextrose has a hi gh osmolarity and causes irritation and thrombophlebitis to peripheral veins. Lipids are isotonic and ther efore less irritating to peripheral veins. Indications 1. Parenteral nutrition is indicated when the GI tract is not available, access cannot be obtained or the patient has failed to tolerate enteral nutrition Ex amples of situations requiring PN are: need for prolonged bowel rest with severe pancreatitis or ileus, inadequate absorption resulting from short bowel syndrome, gastrointestinal fistula, bowel obstruction, severe malnutrition, significant weight loss and/or hypoproteinemia when enteral therapy is not possible, any other disease state or condition in whic h oral or enteral feedings are not an option. Estimating Nutrient Requirements a. Basal energy needs are calculated from patient's weight , height, and age. Additional energy needs are based on an assessment of diagnosis, activity and metabolic n eeds. The older adult can present additional challenges due to co-morbidities. b. Protein needs are determined by the patient's weight and metabolic state (e.g., burn, sepsis, renal disease) c. Fluid requirements are 30 \u2014 35 cc/kg (average sized a dults), or 25 cc/kg (65 years of age or older) d. Assess vitamin and mineral requirements to identify additional supplementation needs. Composition of Parenteral Formulas Dextrose - provides carbohydrate and available in 5%, 10%, 20%, 50% and 70% concentrations. To calculate the calories from dextrose: multiply the ml of dextrose by the concentra tion of the solution to obtain the grams of dextrose, then multiply by 3.4 to obtain kCals. 1000 ml x 70% = 700 gm of dextrose x 3.4 = 2380 kCals Protein is provided in the form of amino acids and is ava ilable in 3%, 7%, 8.5%, 10% and 15% concentrations. To calculate the calories from protein: multiply the ml of protein by the concentration of the solution to obtain the grams of protein, then multiply by 4.0 to obtain kCals 500 ml x 8.5% = 42.5 gms of protein x 4 = 170 kCals Lipids are provided as Long Chain Triglycerides (LCT), available in 10%, 20% and 30% concentr ations, provide a source of Essential Fatty Acids and may be admixed with the dextrose and protein or infused separately. 10% provides 3.0 (used in admixtures only) Monitoring Careful monitoring of PN is essential to prevent complications . Electrolyte, weight, fluid inta ke and output and vital signs should be monitored daily. An initial baseline triglyceride level should be established for patients receiving lipids, and then monitored weekly while on TPN. Once electrolytes are stable weekly labs should be monitored. A catheter care policy should be in place at every institution and strictly adhe red to in order to prevent cat heter associated infections.If nocturnal TPN is running, the first hour sand last hours should be lower rate. The rationale for this is to prevent initial hyperglycemia and then an immediate hypoglycemia at the end of the cycle... Total Parenteral Nutrition Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 89 Complications that develop can be metabo lic and non-metabolic in natu re. Metabolic issues are related to the formula and how the patient responds to the therapy. Non-metabo lic relates to the failure in delivery technique. Daily CMP (Na, K, Cl, CO 2, Glu, BUN, Cr, Ca), PO 4,Mg, (first 2-3 days or until stable) - the following are obtained at baseline then weekly; LFT's, Prealbumin, (Albumin, monthly if resident in long-term care is stable), & CBC (Until stable) Blood glucose q 6 hrs (until stable), then once per day Weight Intake and Output Vital signs Catheter care Weekly CMP, Albumin, CBC For more information on monitoring Parenteral Nutrition consult: Dietitians in Nutrition Support, a dietetic practi ce group of the American Dietetic Association www.dnsdpg.org The American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nu trition (ASPEN). 8630 Fenton Street, Syndrome Refeeding syndrome is a complication which can occur in severely malnourished patients who are aggressively administered parenteral (or enteral) nutrition. It is char acterized by large electrolyte shifts leading to metabolic, neuromuscular and hematologic abnormalities which can be lif e-threatening. The rapid shift of several electrolytes including potassium, phosphorus and magnesium from the ex tracellular to intracellular space along with sodium and water retention are the result of excessive glucose administration. Patients with the following conditions are at risk: Chronic/severe malnutrition Significant weight loss Alcoholism Eating disorders Cancer cachexia Prolonged fasting Phosphorus-deficient TPN Unfed 7-10 days Morbid obesity with significant weight loss Nutrition should be started at half of energy requireme nts with a conservative amount of carbohydrate(150-200 gm for first 24 hours) . Electrolytes and fluid balance should be monitored very closely. Calculating TPN formulations A starting point for calculating parenteral solutions is as follows: Dextrose : Calories from carbohydrates generally provide between 45% to 60% of the total daily calories. However, to avoid the deleterious effects of hyperglycemia, the amount of carbohydrate provided should not exceed 5-7 mg/kg/min (minimum requirement = 1 mg/kg/min). Carbohydrates provide 3.4 kcal/gram. Protein: Calories provided from protein are generally from 10% to 20%. Excessive protein administration increases the metabolic load on the body for utilizing a nd disposing the metabolic byproducts. This is typically illustrated by a rising BUN. Protein provides 4 kcal/gm. Total Parenteral Nutrition Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 90 Lipid : Needed to avoid essential fatty acid deficiency, lipids also contribute to the total daily intake of calories. When TPN is devoid of fat, lipids should be provided 3 times per week (500 ml of 10% lipid or 250 ml of 20%). To avoid overwhelming the immune system with fat and resulting in immunosuppression, the administration of lipids generally should not exceed 30% of the total calories or 1 g/kg/d. Caution with use of lipids for pa tients with egg allergy. To ensure that all substrates mixed together fit into a one liter container, final concentrati ons must add up to 1000 mL or less. The following calculations illustrate how to dete rmine the milliliters provided by each substrate: Example: To a desired 3-in-1 final concentration of 22% dextrose, 3% lipid and 4.0% acids 10% amino acid, and 20% lipid emulsion stock solution, the following calculation will help you determine if this will fit into a one liter container for the TPN solution: Note: 3-in-1 TPN admixtures are recommended to 24 hours. Desired final concentration: 22% dextrose Dextrose: 70 g dextrose = 100 ml D 70 stock solution 22 X (= ml of dextrose needed) 22 g dextrose x 100 ml D 70 = 31.42 ml 70 g dextrose For one liter (1000 ml) of TPN, 314.2 ml will be provided by dextrose. Desired final concentration: 4.0% amino acids Amino acids: 10 g amino acids = 100 ml amino acid 10 stock solution 4.0 g X (= mL of amino acids needed) 4.0 g amino acids x 100 ml AA 10 = 40 ml 10 g amino acids For one liter of TPN, 400 mL will be provided by amino acids . Desired final concentration: 3% lipid Lipids: 20 g lipid = 100 ml lipid 3g X (= ml of lipid needed) 3 g lipid x 100 ml 20% Lipid = 15 ml lipid 20 g lipid In one liter of TPN, 150 ml will be provided from lipids. 314.2 ml Dextrose + 400 ml amino acids + 150 ml lipids = ~865 ml. This formulation will fit into a one liter container allowing room for sterile water and other additives (electrolyt es, vitamins, minerals, etc.). Additives generally make up < 10% of the total volume. In fluid restricted patients, the amount of sterile water added to th e solution can be decreased to \"concentrate\" the solution and allowing a high provision of the macronutrients. Another way of looking at this example is that 22% dextro se will provide 220 grams of car bohydrate/liter; and 4% amino acid will provide 40 gms protein/liter.

It is the only macronutrien t that is not stored in th e body for later use. Every molecule of protein incorporated into the body has a specific job to do. About half of the body protein is in the form of skeletal muscle. The rest is part of vital organs, blood, enzymes and hormones. Protein is composed of amino acids jo ined together by chains to form spec ific proteins. There are 21 amino acids categorized into 3 groups: Indispensable or essential amino acids (I AA)- must come from dietary sources Dispensable or nonessential amino acids (DAA) - synthesized by the body provided there is enough nitrogen in diet Conditionally indispensable amino acids (CIAA)- may be required dur ing serious illness, surgery or injury due to insufficient synthesis Total Parenteral Nutrition Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 93 Categories of Amino Acids Indispensable AA Dispensable AA Conditionally Indispensable Medicine of the National Acad emies, (2005) Protein and amino acids, In: DRI for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Acid s: FNB: NAS. Washington, DC: National Academy Press. Cycle of Protein Exchanges Protein nutrition involves both dietar y protein and body protein reserves. Pr otein reserves are different from stores in that reserves need to be recycled each day to maintain a healthy body. During illness or metabolic stress due to surgery or injury, the protein losse s from normal protein exchanges are considerable. The overall turnover of protein in the body is almost 3 times greater than the usual protein intake. When the diet is inadequate in one or more IAA or there is insufficien t nitrogen to synthesize required amounts of DAA. The body compensates by breaking down more body pr otein for the missing IAA. Over time, inadequate protein intake results in depletion of protein reserves because less is recycled each day. Evaluating Quality of Protein Supplements Registered dietitians (RDs) have the r esponsibility to know the nutrient densit y of products they recommend. Protein supplements are not nutritionally equivalent. Diffe rent products meet diverse resident needs. Castellanos, et al (2006) categorized m odular protein supplements as follows: Complete Protein- products made from milk(casein, wh ey), egg, or soy that naturally contain sufficient amounts of all IAAs Collagen Based- products made from animal skin that may or may not be fortified to contain sufficient amounts of all IAAs Amino Acid Dose- products with fairly large doses of one or more DAAs Protein plus Amino Acid Dose- products made from comple te protein, collagen or a combination of complete and collagen protein with additio nal dose of one or more DAAs Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine reco mmends protein digestibility corrected amino acid score\" (PDCAAS) as the international standard to evaluate the quality of protein supplements (FAO, 1991; IOM, 2005). The PDCAAS represents the quality of the protein in terms of its most limiting IAA using a reference standard based on the EAR (meets the needs of 50% of the healthy population). Total Parenteral Nutrition Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9 DHCC 2009 94 Amino Acid 2005 Adult Reference Pattern mg/gm PRO Histidine 17 Isoleucine 23 Leucine 41 Threonine 24 Tryptophan 6 Valine 29 Adapted from Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, (2005) Protein and amino acids, In: DRI for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Ac ids: FNB: NAS. Washington, DC: National Academy Press. The calculation of the PDCAAS differs from the traditional am ino acid score by the additional step of multiplying the lowest amino acid ratio by the true protein digestibility. Protein Source True Digestibility Milk 95-98% Collagen or Gelatin 95% Adapted from Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, (2005) Protein and amino acids, In: DRI for Energy, Carbohydrate, Fiber, Fat, Fatty Acids, Cholesterol, Protein, and Amino Ac ids: FNB: NAS. Washington, DC: National Academy Press. Steps to Calculate PDCAAS 1. Convert the amino acid profile provided by the manufacturer to mg/g protein. 2. Calculate amino acid score by dividing the milligrams of each IAA per gram of protein by the requirement for each IAA. mg IAA/gm protein mg IAA/gm reference protein 3. Determine digestibility using data from ma nufacturer or source protein data from IOM. 4. Multiply the true digestibility by lowest uncorrected ratio amino acid score = PDCAAS. The PDCAAS tells you the amount of total protein available for tissue synthesis without drawing IAA from other dietary sources or lean body reserves. A PDCAAS of 100% means that the protein supplement contains sufficient amounts of all the IAA. Protein supplements made from casein, whey, so y and egg white have PDCAAS of 100%. Collagen based products must be fortified to have a PDCAAS of 100% becau se the source protein is natu rally devoid of tryptophan and low in other IAAs. Protein plus Amino Acid Dose products made from casein, whey, soy and egg white have PDCAAS of 100%. However, Protein plus Amino Acid Dose products ma de from collagen protein must be fortified to have a PCDAAS of 100%. PDCAAS does not apply to Amino Acid Dose products because these supplements are not sources of total dietary protein. References 1. Castellanos VH, Litchford MD, Campbell W.

The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 96 THE REGULATORY PROCESS BACKGROUND INFORMATION: All nursing facilities are subject to inspection or survey by vi rtue of their certification to participate in Medicare and Medicaid, and/or licensure by the state in which they operate. State licensure standards, generally, ha ve followed Federal certification standard s, and state personnel perform the vast majority of surveys - simultaneously assessing compliance with both licensure and certification requirements. The Federal government also provides training for state surveyors and peri odically conducts inspections with federal surveyors as a check on the performance of state surveyors. These are called Federal Oversight and Support Surveys (FOSS). Compliance with the survey process and requireme nts established by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and published in the State Operations Manual (SOM) is the primary regulatory focus for nursing facilities and all health care providers receiving Medicare and Medi caid funding. CMS is an agency within the federal government's Department of Health and Human Services. CMS administers the federal government's two health insurance programs: Medicare and Medicaid.). State governments also have their own regulations which ar e used for licensing healthcare facilities.. These regulations are enforced by survey agencies, which are most often part of the state's hea lth department. State regulations can build on the federal regulations, since federal regulations are essentia lly the lowest common denominator for facilities to receive payment. Some states, however, have not issued their ow n regulations and adopt the fe deral regulations for their licensing. CMS requires that healthcare facilities hold a current state license in order to be certified to receive federal insurance payments. CMS contracts with these state survey agencies to conduct un announced surveys of Medicare- and/or Medicaid-certified facilities to determine whether or not the facilities are in compliance with the federal regulations. Onsite surveys (inspections) are conducted to determine if the quality and performance standards set forth by CMS are being met. This chapter gives a brief overview of the survey process according to these manda tes. Remember, regulations are continually under review and can be cha nged at any time. The registered dietitia n (RD) must have access to, read and know current federal, state and local regulations. Since re gulations are subject to revision, RDs should know how to monitor the regulatory process and be prepar ed to work with their state affiliate to provide public comment and advocate for optimum resident nutrition services. The RD Role in the Regulatory Process CMS regulations require each nursing facility to employ a qualified dietitian either full-time, part-time, or on a consultant basis. \u00a7483.35(a)(1) If a qualified dietitian is not employed full- time, the facility must designate a person to serve as the director of food service who receives frequently scheduled consultation from a qualifie d dietitian. \u00a7483.35(a)(2) A qualified dietitian is one who is qualifie d based upon either registration by the Commission on Dietetic Registration of the American Dietetic Association, or on the basis of education, training, or experience in identification of dietary needs, planning, and implementation of dietary programs. Intent: \u00a7483.35(a) The intent of this regulation is to ensure that a qualified dietitian is utilized in planning, managing and im plementing dietary service activities in order to assure that the residents receive adequate nutrition. A director of food services has no required minimum qualifications, but must be able to function collaborativ ely with a qualified dietitian in meeting the nutritional needs of the residents. Surveyors are provided the following Interpretive Guidelines to assist in determining if the dietitian is utilized appropriately: \u00a7483.35(a) A dietitian qualified on the basis of education, training, or experience in identification of dietary needs, planning and implementation of dietary programs has experience or training which includes: Assessing special nutritional needs of geriatric and physically impaired persons; Developing therapeutic diets; Developing \"regular diets\" to meet the specialized ne eds of geriatric and physically impaired persons; Developing and implementing conti nuing education programs for dietary services and nursing personnel; Participating in interdisciplinary care planning; Budge ting and purchasing food and s upplies; and Supervising institutional food preparation, service and storage. The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 97 Procedures: \u00a7483.35(a) If resident reviews determine that residents have nutritional problems, the surveyor(s) will determine if these nutritional problems relate to inad equate or inappropriate diet nutrition/assessment and monitoring, and if these are related to dietitian qualifica tions. If the survey team finds problems in resident nutritional status the surveyor is advised to use the follow ing Probes: \u00a7483.35(a): Do practices of the dietitian or food services director contribute to the identified problems in residents' nutritional status? If yes, what are they? What are the educational, training, and experi ence qualifications of the facility's dietitian? The State Operations Manual (SOM) Surveyors use the CMS State Operations Manual (SOM) as the guide for the surveys. Ev ery facility should have a copy of the SOM; and RDs should have a copy of the SOM. The SOM is available on the CMS website at http://www. cms.hhs.gov/center/snf.asp . Click on CMS Internet-only Manuals and then click on Publication # 100-07 with the Title: State Operations Manual. The SOM has multiple components and sections. Appendices P, PP, and R of the SOM are the three appendices related to nursing facilities. (These are available by following the above instructions for the SOM, and then clicking on the Appendix section of the SOM Table of Contents. There are also appendices for home health agencies, hospitals, hospice and other facilities.) Appendix P contains the Survey Protocol for Long-Term Care Facilities Appendix PP contains the Interpretive Gu idelines for Long-Term Care Facilities Appendix R describes the Resident Assessment Instrume nt (which includes the Minimum Data Set or MDS) These Appendices include the following: Survey protocol and procedures Links to relevant CMS transmittals Regulations, including the regulatory citation fro m the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Tag numbers (the alpha-numeric indexing system used to reference specific sections in each SOM Appendix), and Interpretive Guidelines, also know n as \"Guidance to Surveyors.\" It is essential that the RD have access to the reports generated during previous surveys. Request a copy of the last survey report, including any deficiencies and/or citations, from your facility's administrato r. Information is also available at www.medicare.gov/nhcompare/home.asp. Facility Reports Generated by Minimum Data Set (MDS) Three reports are generated regularly through CMS'MDS. Th ese reports are Facility Characteristics, Facility Quality Measure/ Indicator Profile and the Resident Level Summary. It is important that the RD have copies of these reports to be aware of any problems or possible problems that exist. Surv eyors use these reports in Task 1 of the Traditional Survey described below.. The Survey Process Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and nursing facilities (NFs) are re quired to be in compliance with the requirements at 42 CFR Part 483, Subpart B, to receive payment under the Me dicare or Medicaid programs. To certify as a SNF or NF, a facility must complete at least a: Life Safety Code (LSC) survey; and Standard Survey. There are two types of Standard Surveys, the Traditional Survey and the Quality Indicator Survey (QIS). CMS deems both as surveys of record to evaluate compliance of nursing homes with the requirements at 42 CFR 483.5-483.75: CMS is in the process of a staged implementation of the QIS as a replacement for the current (Traditional) survey process. The QIS is a two-staged, computer-assisted survey pr ocess with Stage 1 consisting of both computer analysis of offsite data as well as data collected by surveyors onsite from observations, interviews, and record reviews of large computer-selected resident samples. Stage 2 consists of sy stematic surveyor investiga tions of triggered issues and residents using the Guidance to Surveyors as well as a set of i nvestigative tools known as critical elements protocols. In addition to the Stage 1 and Stage 2 sample-based investigations, the QIS also contains several facility-level tasks that are The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 98 unstaged and are completed either on every survey or when triggered as areas of concern. reviews of large computer- selected resident samples. The informat ion collected throughout Stage 1 is analyzed by computer to derive a set of approximately 160 Quality of Care Indicators (QCIs) that ar e used to compare the facility being surveyed to national norms. QCIs that score beyond a statistical threshold are computer-selected for Stage 2 review, and the relevant residents are also computer selected. Stage 2 consists of sy stematic surveyor investiga tions of triggered issues and residents using a set of detailed investigative tools known as critical elements protocols. In addition to the Stage 1 and Stage 2 sample-based investigations, the QIS also contains several facility-level tasks that are unstaged and are completed either on every survey or when triggered as areas of concern. THE TRADITIONAL SURVEY: Task 1 - Offsite survey preparations The objective of Task 1 is to analyze various sources of inform ation about the facility, to identify and pre-select concerns and potential residents for Phase 1 of the survey, to note con cerns about the facility from other sources listed below and to determine potential concerns that may re quire additional survey team members. The surveyors will review all of the following information and determine potential areas of concern for focus during the survey process. They will identify sp ecific residents for the review sample w ith specific attention being given to the weight loss, dehydration and pressure ulcer groups especially if the QI is triggered at or above 75% and determine if specialty surveyors are needed. Quality Measure/Indicator (QM/I) Reports from the Standard Analytic Reporting System of the CMS National Resident Assessment Data Base Using Quality Measures/Indicators (QM/Is) as a Guide: - Facility Characteristics - Facility Quality Measure/ Indicator Profile - Resident Level Summary Statement of Deficiencies (Form CMS-2567) and Statement of Isolated Deficiencies Whic h Cause No Actual Harm With Only Potential for Minimal Harm OSCAR (Online Survey and Certification Reporting System) Report 3, History Facility Profile and OSCAR Report 4, Full Facility Profile Results of Complaint Investigations Information About Waivers and Variances Information from State Ombudsman Office Preadmission Screening and Resident Review Reports (PASRR) Other Pertinent Information The 27 QM/Is include 12 categories known as Domains: Acci dents, Behavioral / Emotional Patterns, Clinical Management, Cognitive Patterns, Elimination / Continence, Infection Control, Nutrition / Eating, Pain Management, Physical Functioning, Psychotropic Drugs, Quality of Life, Skin Care. They are a critical part of the survey process that was developed as a part of CMS' National Nursing Home Care-mix and Quality Demonstration Project. These are powerful sources of information based upon responses to the MDS 2.0. QM/I's are reflective of MDS assessment currently on file in state databases. They are not the judge and jury of facility performance but are used for quality assurance. QM/Is are used as an indicator of potential problems or concerns that warrant further investigation. Over half of the QM/I's relate to nutrition. Task 2 - Entrance Conference and Onsite Preparatory Activities Surveyors will introduce themselves to the facility administrato r. Other team members will begin the initial tour (Task 3) while the team coordinator does the following: Request copies of menus - bot h general and therapeutic Request copy of work schedules for licensed and registered nursing staff Inform the facility staff that the survey team will communicate with them throughout the survey Explain the survey process and answer any questions from the staff Give the administrator copies of the 3 QI reports and the OSCAR 3 & 4 reports The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 99 Ask the administrator to describe any special features of the facility's care and treatment programs, organization and case mix Inform the administrator that there will be interviews w ith individual residents, groups of residents, family members, friends and legal representatives and that in terviews are conducted privately unless the interviewee requests otherwise Ask that the following information be provided within one hour of the conclusion of the Entrance Conference: List of key facility personnel and their locations Copy of written information provided to residents regarding their rights Meal times, dining locations, copies of all menus (incl uding therapeutic menus) that will be served during the survey Medication pass times List of admissions for the past month and a list of resi dents transferred or discharged during the last 3 months with destinations. Copy of the facility's layout Copy of facility admission contract(s) for all residents Facility policies and procedures to prohib it and investigate allegations of abuse Evidence that the facility monitors accidents and other incidents Current activity calendar Names of residents age 55 and under Names of residents who communicate with non-oral co mmunication devices, sign language or who speak a language other that the dominant language of the facility Ask the facility to complete the Roster/Sample Matrix (CMS- 802) Ask the administrator about procedures to ensure that wa ter is available in the event of loss of normal supply Task 3 - Initial Tour The objective of the Initial Tour is to provide an initial revi ew of the facility, residents and staff; obtain an initial evaluation of the environment of the facility (including the k itchen), and confirm or invalidate the pre-selected concerns and add concerns di scovered onsite. The initial tour focuses on the following: Quality of life Emotional and behavioral conduct of the residents and the reactions and interventions by the staff Care issues, how care is provided and prevalence of special care needs (including, but not necessarily limited to, dehydration, weight loss, pressure ulcers/sores, feeding tubes) Impact of the facility environment and safety issues The initial kitchen tour is a brief observation and overview of the kitchen, not an in-depth study. Surveyors will examine the sanitation practices and cleanliness of the kitchen includi ng observing employee practices to prevent foodborne illness (i.e., handwashing, clean and appropriate attire, sanitary pr actices, no potentially hazardous foods left on the counter or thawing in the sink, no food in steam table at unsafe temperatures.) Task 4 - Sample Selection Surveyors will select a sample of residents for review of car e, using CMS 802 or Roster/Sample Matrix Worksheet and other information gathered to identify residents. Reside nts will be chosen for Phase 1 Sample and as the survey is conducted, Phase 2 sample residents will be chosen based on those concerns the surveyors have (i.e., weight loss or pressure sores/ulcers). The number of residents chosen for revi ew depends on the facility size. Surveyors will talk with residents, families and staff; and review current and closed me dical records. Half of the sample is selected from the weight loss, dehydration and pressu re ulcer/sore resident group. This surveyor task is to select a ca se-mix stratified sample of facility reside nts to assess compliance with the resident- centered long term care requirements. Phase 1 Offsite Sample is done during T ask 1 - Offsite Survey Preparation Initial concerns noted during off-site survey preparation and tour Phase 2 Sample Selection is done after the Tour, using the Offsite Sample and the Tour notes Phase 2 Sample Selection is done part way through the survey. Select concerns for Phase 2 are based on: The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 100 Currently unreviewed conc erns - This is Phase 2 Current concerns for which information gath ered is inconclusive - This is Phase 2 Special factors to consider include: New Admissions Residents most at risk for neglect and abuse Residents in rooms in which variances have been granted Residents receiving hospice services Residents with end-state renal disease Residents under the age of 55 Residents with mental illness or mental retardation Residents who communicate with non-oral communication devices, sign language, or speak a language other than the dominant language of the facility Task 5 - Information Gathering : This task includes the following sub-tasks, once the sample has be selected in Task 4.: Sub Task 5A General Observations of the Facility: Assessment of the environment of the facility affecting the resident's life, health and safety Condition of the environment Proper and safe storage of drugs, biologicals, housekeeping compounds and equipment Sub Task 5B Kitchen/Food Service Observations (Form CMS 804) Availability of food in relation to the number of residents Whether food being prepared is cons istent with the written, planned menu If recipes are available, consistent with the menu and followed by employees If appropriate equipment is available and used to prepare and serve foods If food is being held for > 30 minutes prior to food service (e.g., in steam table, oven, refrigerator rather than freezer, etc.) If leftovers used were stored and used within the a ppropriate time frames and reheated to at least 165 F Dining Observations Resident complaints Unplanned weight loss Mechanically altered diets Sub Task 5C Resident Review How resident outcomes and quality of life are related to the provision of care by the facility If the care has enabled residents to reach or mainta in their highest practicable physical, mental and psychosocial well-being If residents are assisted to have the best quality of life that is possible If the facility has properly assessed its residents through the RAI If there are additional areas of concer n that need to be investigated Presence of pressure ulcers / sores Review of residents receiving hospice or dialysis Sub Task 5D Quality of Life Assessment Resident interview Group interview Interview with family member or friend of the non-interviewable resident Sub Task 5E Medication Pass Observation Observe the actual preparation and administration of medications Sub Task 5F Quality Assessme nt and Assurance Review Determine if the facility has a Quality Assessment and Assurance Committee - That the committee consists of the Director of Nu rsing, a physician designated by the facility and 3 members of the facility staff (minimum requirements) - The committee meets at least quarterly - The committee has a formal method to identify issues that require quality assessment and assurance activities - The committee has a formal method to respond to identified quality deficiencies and evaluate the effectiveness of that response The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 101 For facilities with identified actual or probable quality deficiencies, determine if the facility: - Has identified quality deficiencies - Has developed and implemented a plan to address those deficiencies - Has evaluated, or has a plan to evaluate, the effectiveness of the planned implementation Sub Task 5G Abuse Prohibition Review Includes policies and procedures to prohibit abuse, neglect, involuntary seclusion and misappropriation of property for the following - Screening of potential hires - Training of employees (both new and ongoing) - Prevention policies and procedures - Identification of possible incidents or allegations which need investigation - Investigation of incidents and allegations - Protection of residents during investigations - Reporting of incidents, investigations and facilit y response to the results of their investigations Task 6 - Determination of Compliance Surveyors will review and analyze all data to determine wh ether the facility has failed to meet one of more of the regulatory requirements. Depending on the findings, the su rveyors may choose to extend th e survey. Deficiencies are cited under the various \"F\" tags noted in the federal regulations (see listing in this section.) Surveyors will determine the severity of the deficiency dependent on whether the deficiency caused immediate harm to a resident or residents. (Refer to Scope and Severity Grid in this section for more information.) Consistent documentation in medical records is essential. Emphasis will be placed on weight loss, dehydration and pressure ulcer/sore and sentinel event residents (i.e., dehy dration, fecal impaction and pressure ulcers on low risk residents). The determination of avoidable / una voidable will be made and the deficiency stated. Evidence evaluation includes two categories: Potential or actual physical, mental or psychosocial injury or deterioration to a resident including violation of residents' rights. Examples may include: Development or worsening of a pressure ulcer Loss of dignity due to lying in a urine-saturated bed for a prolonged period Social isolation caused by staff failure to assist resident in participating in scheduled activities Lack of (or the potential for lack of) reaching the highest practicable level of physical, mental or psychosocial well-being. Examples may include: Facility identified the resident's desire to reach a higher level of ability but failed to implement or consistently implement the plan of care Facility identified a need in the comprehensive assessment but failed to develop a care plan to meet the resident's needs and therefore the resident was not gi ven the opportunity to reach his/her highest practicable well-being Facility failed to identify the resident's need/problem/a bility to improve (e.g., the ability to eat independently if given assistive devices) therefore the resident was not given the opportunity to reach his/her highest practicable well-being Facilities written procedures or oral explanations do not provide information about which residents are supposed to be fully informed Task 7 - Exit Conference The objective of the exit conference is to inform the facility of the survey team's observations and preliminary findings. The surveyors describe the team's preliminary deficiency findi ngs and let the facility know they will receive a report of the survey, which will contain any deficiencies that have been cited against the facility (CMS-2567). The surveyors should provide the facility the opportunity to discuss and supply additional information that they believe is pertinent to the identified findings. The RD should request that he/she be in volved in the Exit Conference if at all possi ble. When the report is received, the RD should be involved in the response to any cit es and in writing the Plan of Correction (PoC). The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 102 Survey results are posted on the CMS website and must also be posted in the facility for anyone to review. II. - The Quality Indicators Survey (QIS) The QIS standard survey consists of the following Tasks (com plete details are available at the CMS website listed with resources at the end of this chapter) Task 1: Offsite Survey Preparation: Offs ite Survey Preparation and Initial Sampling Task 2: Onsite Preparatory Activities and Entrance Conference Task 3: Initial Tour Task 4: Stage I Survey Tasks : Finalize Sample Selection , Stage I Sample Selection, Stage I Team Meetings (first meeting), Stage I Information Gathering, Stage I Admission Sample Review, Medical Record Review, Stage I Census Sample Review, Resident Interviews , Resident Unavailable for Interviews, Resident Observations, Staff Interviews, Medical Record Review, Family Interviews Task 5: Non-Staged Survey Tasks: Resident Council President/Representative Interview, Dining Observation, Kitchen/Food Service Observation, Infection Cont rol Policies and Procedures, Demand Billing Review, Abuse Prohibition Review, Quality Assessme nt and Assurance (QA & A) Review Task 6: Transition From Stage I to Stage II: Updating of the Resident Pool, Review Completion of Stage I, Review Surveyor-Initiated Residents and/or Care Areas, Import All Data into the Primary Laptop, Review the Relevant Findings Report, Review the QCI Results Report Task 7: Stage II Survey Tasks: Introduction, Team Meetings, Stage II Sample Selection, Substituting Residents, Supplementing the Sample, Staff Assignment s, Stage II Information Gathering, Stage II Critical Element Pathways, Medication Administration Obser vation and Unnecessary Drug Review, Facility-Level Investigations, Environmental Observation, Resident Funds, Admission, Transfer, and Discharge Review, Sufficient Staff Task 8: Analysis and Decision-Making: Integration of In formation, Integration of Facility-Level Information, Integration of Critical Element Pathways, Analysis of In formation Gained Analysis of Scope and Severity and Team Decision-Making Task 9: Exit Conference: Prior to the exit conference, in which case the facility will be provided with findings from the standard and extended survey; or Subsequent to the standard survey, but no longer than 2 weeks after the completion of the standard su rvey, if the survey team is unable to complete the extended survey prior to the exit conference. Statement of Deficiencies (Form CMS2567) The Statement of Deficiencies (SOD) has several functions: it is the document that cites the specific deficiencies incurred during the standard or complaint survey; it contai ns the PoC written by the facility; it is disclosed to the public. The SOD is mailed within 10 working days after the survey and if deficiencies are present, the PoC is due back to the state after 10 calendar days. Writing a Plan of Correction (PoC) An acceptable PoC must : Address how the corrective action will be accomplished for t hose residents found to have been affected by the deficient practice; Address how the facility will identify other residents havi ng the potential to be affected by the same deficient practice; Address what measures will be put into place or systemic ch anges made to ensure that the deficient practice will not recur; Indicate how the facility plans to monitor its performance to make sure that solutions are sustained. The facility must develop a plan for ensuring that the correction is ach ieved and sustained. It must be implemented and the corrective action evaluated for its effectiveness. The Po C is integrated into the quality assurance system; and Includes dates when corrective action will be complete d. The corrective action completion dates must be acceptable to the State. If unacceptable, the State notifi es the facility in writing and the PoC is revised. If accepted, the State will notify the facility by phone, e-mail, etc. The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 103 Informal Dispute Resolution (IDR) The purpose of the IDR is to give the facility one opportunity to refute cited deficiencies after any survey. The request must be submitted in writing along with an explanation of th e specific deficiencies that are being disputed. The request must be made within the 10 calendar day peri od the facility has for submitting the PoC. In writing an IDR, be specific regarding what deficienci es are being disputed and reas ons for this. Include supporting documentation. These may include statements in the medical reco rd that refutes the facts as st ated in the deficiency. Be factual, do not offer opinions. Be concise and organized. NOTE: Surveyors can make errors related to not having enoug h information, not being informed, or not having a clear understanding of the particular areas related to nutrition or dietary. Be sure to represent the facility and hold surveyors accountable for the legitimacy of the process in cluding accuracy and reliability of conclusions. If an IDR is successful, deficiencies will be deleted, any en forcement action(s) imposed solely because of that deficiency will be rescinded and the scope and severity may be ad justed to reflect the elimination of the citation. Included below is the Scope and Severity grid for rating nursing home deficiencies, followed by a brief description of the grid components. Please refer to the SOM from CMS for more detailed information. Scope and Severity Grid for Rating Nursing Home Deficiencies Level 4: Immediate Jeopardy to resident health or safety.

Only HCFA may impose denial of all payments. 3. Termination may be imposed by the State or HCFA at any time when appropriate. As of January 14, 2000 , regulations include the following: \"Double G.\" If the facility receives a \"G\" level deficiency or hi gher and if another \"G\" leve l deficiency or higher was received at the time of the last full survey or since the l ast full survey, a remedy or fine can be assessed immediately without an \"opportunity to correct.\" Per-Instance CMP: In addition to the traditional per-day Civil Money Penalties, a single CMP ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 on a per-instance basis for non-compliance may be imposed with no \"opportunity to correct.\" IMPORTANT : Regulations constantly change. It is imperative that the RD be aware of all changes, amendments and updates to federal, state and local regulations. F325 Nutrition \u00a7483.25(i) was revised with an Effective/Implementation Date of 09-01-08. It is important to understand all regula tions and interpretive guidelines applied to facilities, especially those that relate specifically to nutrition. F-Tag 325 Nutrition is included in de tail since it had significant revisions in 2008. There is also a listing of other FTags related to nutrition that can be found beginning on page 226. Based on a resident's comprehensive assessment, th e facility must ensure that a resident-- \u00a7483.25(i) (1) Maintains acceptable parameters of nutritional status, such as body weight and protein levels, unless the resident's clinical condition demonstrates that this is not possible; and \u00a7483.25(i) (2) Receives a therapeutic diet when there is a nutriti onal problem. INTENT: \u00a7483.25( i) Nutritional Status The intent of this requirement is that the resident main tains, to the extent possible, acceptable parameters of nutritional status and that the facility: Provides nutritional care and services to each resident, c onsistent with the resident's comprehensive assessment; Recognizes, evaluates, and addresses the needs of every resi dent, including but not limited to, the resident at risk or already experiencing impaired nutrition; and The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 105 Provides a therapeutic diet that takes into account the r esident's clinical condition, and preferences, when there is a nutritional indication. DEFINITIONS: Definitions are provided to clarify clinical terms related to nutritional status. \"Acceptable parameters of nutritional st atus\" refers to factors that reflect that an individual's nutritional status is adequate, relative to his/her overall condition and prognosis. \"Albumin\" is the body's major plasma protein, essentia l for maintaining osmotic pressure and also serving as a transport protein. \"Anemia\" refers to a condition of low hemoglobin concen tration caused by decreased production, increased loss, or destruction of red blood cells. \"Anorexia\" refers to loss of appetite, including loss of interest in seeking and consuming food. \"Artificial nutrition\" refers to nutriti on that is provided through routes other than the usual oral route, typically by placing a tube directly into the stomach, the intestine or a vein. \"Avoidable/Unavoidable\" failure to maintain acceptable parameters of nutritional status: o \"Avoidable\" means that the resident did not maintain acceptable parameters of nutritional status and that the facility did not do one or more of the following: evaluate th e resident's clinical condition and nutritional risk factors; define and implement interventions that are consistent with resident needs, r esident goals and recognized standards of practice; monitor and evaluate the impact of the in terventions; or revise the interventions as appropriate. o \"Unavoidable\" means that the resident did not maintain acceptable parameters of nutritional status even though the facility had evaluated the resident's clinical conditi on and nutritional risk factor s; defined and implemented interventions that are consistent with resident needs, goal s and recognized standards of pr actice; monitored and evaluated the impact of the interventions; and revised the approaches as appropriate. \"Clinically significant\" refers to effects, results, or con sequences that materially affect or are likely to affect an individual's physical, mental, or psychosocial well-being eith er positively by preventing, stabilizing, or improving a condition or reducing a risk, or negatively by exacerbating, causing, or contri buting to a symptom, illness, or decline in status. \"Current standards of practice\" refers to approaches to care, procedures, techniques, treatments, etc., that are based on research or expert consensus and that are contained in current manuals, textbooks, or publications, or that are accepted, adopted or promulgated by recognized professiona l organizations or national accrediting bodies. \"Dietary supplements\" refers to nutrients (e.g., vitamins, mi nerals, amino acids, and herbs) that are added to a person's diet when they are missing or not consumed in enough quantity. \"Insidious weight loss\" refers to a gradual, unintended, progressive weight loss over time. \"Nutritional Supplements\" refers to products that are u sed to complement a resident's dietary needs (e.g., total parenteral products, enteral products , and meal replacement products). \"Parameters of nutritional status\" refers to factors (e.g ., weight, food/fluid intake, and pertinent laboratory values) that reflect the resident's nutritional status. \"Qualified dietitian\" refers to one who is qualified based upon either registration by the Commission on Dietetic Registration of the American Dietetic Association or as perm itted by State law, on the basis of education, training, or experience in identification of dietary needs, pl anning, and implementation of dietary programs. \"Therapeutic diet\" refers to a diet ordered by a health care practitioner as part of the treatment for a disease or clinical condition, to eliminate, decrease, or in crease certain substances in the diet (e.g ., sodium or potassium), or to provide mechanically altered food when indicated. \"Usual body weight\" refers to the resident's usual we ight through adult life or a stable weight over time. Overview of Nutrition: The early identification of residents with, or at risk for, impaired nutrition, may allow the interdisciplinary team to develop and implement interventions to stabilize or improve nutritional status before additional complications arise. However, since intake is not the onl y factor that affects nutritional status, nutrition-related interventions only sometimes improve markers of nutritional stat us such as body weight and laboratory results. While they can often be stabilized or improved, nutritional deficits and im balances may take time to improve or they may not be fully correctable in some individuals. A systematic approach can he lp staff's efforts to optimize a resident's nutritional status. This process includes identifying and assessing each resident's nutr itional status and risk factors, evaluating/analyzing the assessment information, developing and consistently implementing pertinent appr oaches, and monitoring the effectiveness of interventions and revising them as necessary. The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 106 ASSESSMENT According to the American Dietetic Association, \"Nutritional assessment is a systematic process of obtaining, verifying and interpreting data in order to make decisions about the nature and cause of nutrition-related problems.\" The assessment also provides information that he lps to define meaningful interventions to address any nutrition-related problems. The interdisciplinary team clarifi es nutritional issues, needs, and goals in the context of the resident's overall condition, by using observation and gatheri ng and considering information relevant to each resident's eating and nutritional status. Pertinent sources of such inform ation may include interview of the resident or resident representative, and review of information (e.g., past histor y of eating patterns and weight and a summary of any recent hospitalizations) from other sources. The facility identifies ke y individuals who should participate in the assessment of nutritional status and related causes and consequences. Qualified di etitians help identify nutr itional risk factors and recommend nutritional interventions, based on each resident's me dical condition, needs, desires, and goals. Although the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI) is the only assessment tool specifically required, a more in-depth nutritional assessment may be needed to identify the nature and causes of impaired nut rition and nutrition-rela ted risks. Completion of the RAI does not remove the facility's responsibility to document a more detailed resident assessment, where applicable. The in-depth nutritional assessment may utilize existing informati on from sources, such as the RAI, assessments from other disciplines, observation, and resident and family interviews. The assessment will identify usual body weight, a history of reduced appetite or progressive weight loss or gain prior to admission, medical conditions such as a cerebrovascular accident, and events su ch as recent surgery, which may have a ffected a resident's nutritional status and risks. The in-depth nutritional assessment may also include the following information: General Appearance - General appearance includes a d escription of the resident's overall appearance (e.g., robust, thin, obese, or cachectic) and other findings (e.g ., level of consciousness, responsiveness, affect, oral health and dentition, ability to use the hands and arms , and the condition of hair, nails, and skin) that may affect or reflect nutritional status. Height - Measuring a resident's height provides informa tion that is relevant (in conjunction with his or her weight) to his/her nutritional status. There are various ways to estimate height if standing height cannot be readily measured. A protocol for determining height helps to ensure that it will be measured as consistently as possible. Weight - Weight can be a useful indicator of nutritional status, when evaluated within the context of the individual's personal history and overall condition. When weighing a resident, adjustment for amputations or prostheses may be indicated. Significant unintended changes in weight (loss or gain) or insidious weight loss may indicate a nutritional problem. Current standards of practice recommend weighing the resident on admission or readmission (to establish a baseline weight), weekly for the first 4 weeks after admission and at least monthly thereafter to help identify and document trends such as insidious weight loss. Weighing may also be pertinent if there is a significant change in co ndition, food intake has declined and persisted (e.g., for more than a week), or there is other evidence of altere d nutritional status or fluid and electrolyte imbalance. In some cases, weight monitoring is not indicated (e .g., the individual is terminally ill and requests only comfort care). Obtaining accurate weights for each resident may be aide d by having staff follow a consistent approach to weighing and by using an appropriately calibrated and functioning scale (e.g., wheelchair scale or bed scale). Since weight varies throughout the day, a consistent process and technique (e.g., weighing the resident wearing a similar type of clothing, at approximately the same time of the day, using the same scale, either consistently wearing or not wearing orthotics or prostheses, and verifying scale accuracy) can help make weight comparisons more reliable. A system to verify weights can help to ensure accuracy. Weights obtained in different settings may differ substantially. For exampl e, the last weight obtained in the hospital may differ markedly from the initial weight upon admission to the f acility, and is not to be used in lieu of actually weighing the resident. Approaches to improving the accu racy of weights may include reweighing the resident and recording the current weight, reviewing approaches to obtaining and verifying weight, and modifying those approaches as needed. The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 107 Examples of other factors that may impact weight and the significance of apparent weight changes include: The resident's usual weight through adult life; Current medical conditions; Calorie restricted diet; Recent changes in dietary intake; and Edema. Food and fluid intake - The nutritional assessment includes an estimate of calori e, nutrient and fluid needs, and whether intake is adequate to meet those needs. It al so includes information such as the rout e (oral, enteral or parenteral) of intake, any special food formulation, meal and snack pa tterns (including the time of supplement or medication consumption in relation to the meals), dislikes, and pr eferences (including ethnic foods and form of foods such as finger foods); meal/snack patterns, and prefe rred portion sizes. Fluid loss or retention can cause short term weight change. Much of a resident's daily fluid intake comes from meal s; therefore, when a resident has decreased appetite, it can result in fluid/electrolyte imbalance. Abrupt weight changes, change in food in take, or altered level of consciousness are some of the clinical manifestations of fluid and electrolyte imbalance. Laboratory tests (e.g., electrolytes, BUN, creatinine and serum osmolality ) can help greatly to identify, manage, and monitor fluid and electrolyte status. Altered Nutrient intake, absorption, and utilization. Poor intake, continuing or unabated hunger, or a change in the r esident's usual intake that persists for multiple meals, may indicate an underlying problem or illness. Examples of causes include: The inab ility to consume meals provided (e.g., as a result of the form or consistency of food/fluid, cognitive or functional decline, arthritis-rela ted impaired movement, neuropathic pain, or insufficient assistance); Insufficient availabilit y of food and fluid (e.g., inadequate amount of food or fluid or inadequate tube feedings); Environmental factors affecting food intake or appetite (e.g., comfort and level of disruption in the dining environment); Adverse consequences related to medications; and Diseases and conditions such as cancer, diabetes mellitu s, advanced or uncontrolled heart or lung disease, infection and fever, liver disease, hyperthyroidism, m ood disorders, and repetitive movement disorders (e.g., wandering, pacing, or rocking). The use of diuretics and other medications may cause wei ght loss that is not associated with nutritional issues, but can also cause fluid and electrolyte imbalance/de hydration that causes a loss of appetite and weight. Various gastrointestinal disorders such as pancreatitis, gastritis, motility disorders, small bowel dysfunction, gall bladder disease, and liver dysfunction may affect di gestion or absorption of food. Prolonged diarrhea or vomiting may increase nutritional requirements due to nutrient and fluid losses. Constipation or fecal impaction may affect appetite and excretion. Pressu re ulcers and some other wounds and other health impairments may also affect nutritional requirements. A hypermetabolic state results from an increased demand for energy and protein and may increase the risk of weight loss or under-nutrition. Examples of causes include advanced chronic obstructive pulmona ry disease (COPD), pneumonia and other infections, cancer, hyperthyroidism, and fever. Early identificatio n of these factors, regardless of the presence of any associated weight changes, can help the facility choose appropriate interventions to minimize any subsequent complications. Often, several of these factors affecting nutrition coexist. Chewing abnormalities - Many conditions of the mouth, teeth, and gums can affect the resident's ability to chew foods. For example, oral pain, dry mouth, gingivitis, periodontal disease, ill-fitting dentures, and broken, decayed or missing teeth can impair oral in take. Swallowing abnormalities - Various direct and indirect causes can affect the resident's ability to swallow. These include but are not limited to stroke, pain, lethargy, confusion, dry mouth, and diseases of the oropharynx and esophagus. Swallowing ability may fluctuate from day to day or over time. In some indi viduals, aspiration pneumonia can complicate swallowing abnormalities. NOTE: Swallowing studies are not always required in order to assess eating and swallowing; however, when they are indicated, it is essential to in terpret any such tests in the proper context. A clinical evaluation of swallowing may be used to evaluate average daily or al function. Functional ability - The ability to eat independently may be helped by addressing factors th at impair function or by providing appropriate individual assistance, supervision, or assistive devices. Conditions affecting functiona l ability to eat and drink The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 108 include impaired upper extremity motor coordination and strength or reduced range of motion (any of which may be hampered by stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, tardive dyskinesia, or other neuromuscular disorders or by sensory limitations (e.g ., blindness)). Cognitive impairment may also affect a resident's ability to use a fork, or to eat, chew, a nd swallow effectively. Medications - Medications and nutritional supplements may affect, or be affected by, the intake or utilization of nutrients (e.g., liquid phenytoin taken with tube feedings or grapefruit jui ce taken with some antihyperlipidemics). Medications from almost every pharmaceutical class can affect nutritional status, directly or indirectly; for example, by causing or exacerbating anorexia, lethargy, confusion, nausea, constipation, impairing taste, or altering gastrointestinal function. Inhaled or ingested medica tions can affect food intake by causing pharyngitis, dry mouth, esophagitis, or gastritis. To the extent possible, consideration of medication/nut rient interactions and adverse consequences should be individualized. Goals and prognosis - Goals and prognosis refer to a resident's projected personal and clinical outcomes. These are influenced by the resident's pr eferences (e.g., willingness to participate in weight management interventions or desire for nutritional support at end-of-life), anticipated course of a resident's overall condition and progression of a disease (e.g., end-st age, terminal, or other irreversible conditions affecting food intake, nutritional status, and weight go als), and by the resident's willingness and capacity to permit additional diagnostic testi ng, monitoring and treatment. Laboratory/Diagnostic Evaluation Laboratory tests are so metimes useful to help identify underlying causes of impaired nutrition or when the clinical assessment alone is not enough to define someone's nutritional status. Abnormal laboratory values may, but do not necessarily, imply that treatable clinical problems exist or that interventions are needed. Confirmation is generally desirable through additiona l clinical evaluation and evidence such as food intake, underlying medical cond ition, etc. For example, serum albumin may help establish prognosis but is only sometimes helpful in identifying impaired nutrition or guiding interventions. Serum albumin may drop significantly during an acute illn ess for reasons unrelated to nutrition; therefore, albumin may not improve, or may fall further, despite consumption of adequate amounts of calories and protein. The decision to order laboratory tests, and the interpretation of subsequent results, is best done in light of a resident's overall conditio n and prognosis. Before or dering laboratory tests it is appropriate for the health care practitioner to determine and indicate whethe r the tests would potentially change the resident's diagnosis, management, outcome or quality of life or otherwise add to what is already known. Although laboratory tests such as albumin and pre-albumin may he lp in some cases in deciding to initiate nutritional interventions, there is no evidence that they are useful for the serial follow-up of undernourished individuals. NOTE: If laboratory tests were done prior to or after admission to the facility and the test results are abnormal, the physician or other licensed health care pr actitioner, in collaboration with the interdisciplinary team, reviews the information and determines whether to intervene or order additional diagnostic testing. ANALYSIS: Analysis refers to using the information from multiple sources to include, but not limited to, the Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI), and additional nutritional asse ssments as indicated to determine a resident's nutritional status and develop an individualized care plan. Resultant conc lusions may include, but are not limited to: a target range for weight based on the individual's overall condition, goals, prognosis, usual body weight , etc; approximate calorie, protein, and other nutrient needs; whether and to what extent weight stabilization or improvement can be anticipated; and whether altered weight or nutritional status could be related to an underlying me dical condition (e.g., fluid and electrolyte imbalance, medication-related anorexia, or an infection). Suggested para meters for evaluating significance of unplanned and undesired weight loss are: Interval Significant Loss Severe Loss 1 month 5% Greater than 5% 3 months 7.5% Greater than 7.5% 6 months 10% Greater than 10% The following formula determines percentage of weight loss: % of body weight loss = (usual weight - actual weight) / (usual weight) x 100 Based on analysis of relevant information, the facility identifies a clinically pertinent basis for any conclusions that a resident could not attain or maintain acceptable parameters of nutritional status. Specification of the Nutritional Concern: A clear statement of the nature of the nutritional concern provides the basis for resident-specific interventions. Many residents have multiple coexisting issues. For example: Poor food and fluid intake: The resident has poor intake, is not consuming specific food groups, and has increased nutritional needs specific to clinical conditions. The resident also has lost significant wei ght over a few days while taking medications that may affect The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 109 appetite. Specific clinical conditions: The resident has an infection with fever and is in a hyper-metabolic state associated with an increased demand for energy and protein. Th e resident also has a neuromuscular disorder affecting the ability to eat or swallow, and has impaired cognition affecting a ttention and appetite. CARE PLANNING AND INTERVENTIONS: The management of nutrition in nursing homes involves various medical, psychosocial, ethical, and func tional considerations. Based on informat ion generated by the comprehensive assessment and any pertinent additional nut ritional assessment, the interdisciplinary t eam (including a physician or other licensed health care practitioner and the resident or the reside nt's representative) develops an individualized care plan. The care plan addresses, to the extent possi ble, identified causes of impaired nutritional status, reflects the resident's goal s and choices, and identifies resident-specific interventions a nd a time frame and parameters for monitoring. The care plan is updated as needed; e.g., as conditions change, goals are met, interventions are determined to be ineffective, or as specific treatable causes of nutrition-related problems (anorexia, impaired chewing, etc.) are identified. If nutritional goals are not achieved, different or additiona l pertinent approaches are considered and implemented as indicated. Pertinent documentation can help identify the basis (e.g., current resi dent status, comorbid cond itions, prognosis, and resident choices) for nutrition-related goals and interventions. Resident Choice A resident or resident representative has the right to make informed choices about accepting or declining care and treatment. The facility can help the resident exercise those rights effectively by discussing with the resident (or the resident's representative) the resident's condition, treatment options (including related ri sks and benefits, and expected outcomes), personal preferences, and any potential conseque nces of accepting or refusing treatment. If the resident declines specific interventions, the facility must address the resident's concerns and offer relevant alternatives. The facility's care reflects a resident's choices, either as offered by the resident directly or via a valid advance directive, or based on a decision made by the resident's surrogate or repr esentative in accordance with st ate law. The presence of care instructions, such as an advance directive, declining some interventions does not necessarily imply that other support and care was declined or is not pertinent. When preferences are not specified before hand, decisions related to the possible provision of supplemental or artificial nutrition sh ould be made in conjunction with the resident or resident's representative in accordance with state law, taking into account relevant consid erations such as condition, pr ognosis, and a resident's known val ues and choices. NOTE: The presence of a \"Do Not Resuscitate\" (DNR) order does not by itself indicate that the resident is declining other appropriate treatment and services. It only indicates that the r esident has chosen not to be resuscitated if cardiopulmonary functions cease. Meeting Nutritional Needs: The scope of interventions to meet resident s' nutritional needs depends on many factors, including, but not limited to a resident's current food intake, the degree of nutritional impairment or risk, resident choices, the response to initial interventions, an d the feasibility of addressing underlying conditions and causes. Basic energy needs can generally be met by providing a diet that includ es enough calories to stabilize current body weight. Adjustments may be necessary when factors exist such as those discussed within this document. For example, limits on dairy products may be desirable in individuals with l actose intolerance, and additional amounts of nutrients and calories may be needed for individuals with hypermetabolic states (e.g., fever, hypert hyroidism, acute wounds, or heart or lung disease), to try to keep the body from using lean body mass for energy and wound repair. Diet Liberalization : Research suggests that a liberalized diet can enhance the quality of life and nutritional status of older adults in long-term care facilities. Thus, it is often beneficial to minimize restric tions, consistent with a resident's c ondition, prognosis, and choices before using supplementation. It may also be helpful to provide the reside nts their food preferences, before using supplementation. This pertains to newly developed meal plans as well as to the revi ew of existing diets. Dietary restrictions, therapeutic (e.g., low fat or sodium restricted) diets, and mechanically altered diets may help in select situations. At other times, they may impair adequate nutrition and lead to further decline in nutr itional status, especially in already undernourished or at-risk individuals. When a resident is not eating well or is losi ng weight, the interdisciplinar y team may temporarily abate dietary restrictions and liberalize the diet to improve the resi dent's food intake to try to stabilize their weight. Sometimes, a resident or resident's representative decides to decline medica lly relevant dietary restrictions. In such circumstances, the resident, facility and practitioner collaborate to identify pertinent alternatives. Weight-Related Interventions For many residents (including overweight indi viduals), the resident's usual body weight prior to decline or admission is the most relevant basis for weight-related interventions. Basing interventions on ideal body weight can be misleading, because ideal body weight h as not been definitively established for the frail elderly and The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 110 those with chronic illnesses and disabilities. The care plan in cludes nutritional interventions that address underlying risks and causes of weight loss (e.g., the need for eating assistance, reduction of medication side effects, and additional food that the resident will eat) or unplanned weight gain. It is im portant that the care plan address insidious, abrupt, or sudden decline in intake or insidious weight loss that does not tr igger review of the Nutritional Status Resident Assessment Protocol (RAP); for example, by intensifying observation of intake and eating patterns, monitoring for complications related to poor intake, and seeking underl ying cause(s). Many risk factors and some causes of weight loss can be addressed, at least partially, while others may not be modifiable . In some cases, certain interventions may not be indicated or appropriate, based on individual goals a nd prognosis. Weight stability, rather th an weight gain, may sometimes be the most pertinent short-term or long-term objective for the nut ritionally at-risk or compromised resident. After an acute illness or as part of an advanced or end-stage medical conditio n, the resident's weight a nd other nutritional parameters may not return to previous levels and may stabilize at a lo wer level, sometimes indefin itely. NOTE: There should be a documented clinical basis for any conclusion that nutritional status or significant we ight change are unlikely to stabilize or improve (e.g., physician's documentation as to wh y weight loss is medically unavoidable). Weight Gain: Unplanned weight gain in a resident may have signif icant health implications. Rapid or abrupt increases in weight may also indicate significant fluid excess. After assessing the resident for the cause of the weight gain, care plan interventions may include dietary alterations based on the resi dent's medical condition, choices, and needs. If the resident exercises his/her right to choose and declines dietary restric tions, the facility discusses with the resident the benefits of maintaining a lower weight and the possible consequences of not doing so. A health care pr actitioner can help inform the resident about the rationale for the recommended plan of care . Environmental Factors : Appetite is often enhanced by the appeali ng aroma, flavor, form, and appearance of food. Resident-specific facility practices that may help improve intake include provi ding a pleasant dining experience (e.g., flexible dining environments, styles and schedules), providing meals that are palatable, attractive and nutritious (e.g., prepare food with seasonings, serve food at proper temperatur es, etc.), and making sure that the environment where residents eat (e.g., dining room and/or re sident's room) is conducive to dining. Anorexia : The facility, in consultation with the practitioner, identifies and addresses treatable cause s of anorexia. For example, the practitioner may consider adjusting or stopping medications that may have caused the resi dent to have dyspepsia or become lethargic, constipated, or confused, and reevaluate the resident to determine whet her the effects of the medications are the reasons for the anorexia and subsequent weight loss. Where psychosis or a mood disorder su ch as depression has been identified as a cause of anorexia or weight change, treatment of the underl ying disorder (based on an appr opriate diagnostic evaluation) may improve appetite. However, other coex isting conditions or factors instead of, or in addition to, depression, may cause or contribute to anorexia. In addition, th e use of antidepressants is not generally considered to be an adequate substitute for appropriately investigating and addressi ng modifiable risk factors or other underlying causes of anorexia and weight loss. Wound Healing: Healing of acute (e.g., postoperativ e) and chronic (e.g., pressure ul cer) wounds requires enough calories and protein so that the body will not use lean body mass (m uscle) for energy and wound repair. However, to date, no routinely beneficial wound-specific nutritional measures have been identified. Care plan interventions for a resident who has a wound or is at risk of developing a wound may include providing enough calories to maintain a stable weight and a daily protein intake of approximately 1.2-1.5 gm protein/Kg body weight. The recommended daily protein intake may be adjusted according to clinical need and st andards of clinical practice for situations in which more calories and protein are indicated. Sometimes, it may be most appropriate to try to encourage the resident to eat as many calories and as much protein as tolerated, because he/she does not desire or cannot tolerate more aggressive nutritional interventions. Additional strategies for wound healing may be considered when indi cated. A multivitamin/mineral supplement may be prescribed, however current evidence does not defin itively support any specific dietary supp lementation (e.g., Vitamin C and Zinc) unless the resident has a specific vitamin or mineral deficiency. Functional Factors Based on the comprehensive interdisciplinar y assessment, the facility provides the necessary assistance to allow the resident to eat and drink adequately. A resident with functional impairment may need help with eating. Examples of such interventions may include, but are not limited to: ensuring that sensory devices such as eyeglasses, dentures, and hearing aids are in place; providi ng personal hygiene before and after meals, properly positioning the individual, providing eat ing assistance where needed, and prov iding the assistive devices/utensils identified in the assessment. The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 111 Chewing and Swallowing In deciding whether and how to intervene for chewing and swallowing abnormalities, it is essential to take a holistic approach and look beyond the symp toms to the underlying causes. Pertinent interventions may help address the resident's eating, chewing, and swallowing problems and optimize comfort and enjoyment of meals. Examples of such interventions may include providing proper pos itioning for eating; participation in a restorative eating program; use and (e.g., supervision, cueing, hand-over-hand) during every meal/snack where assistance is needed. Treating medical conditions (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux disease and oral and dental problems) that can impair swallowing or cau se coughing may improve a chewing or swallowing problem. Examples of other relevant interventions include adjusting medications that cause dry mouth or coughing, and providing liquids to moisten the mouth of someone with impaired saliva production. Excessive modi fication of food and fluid consistency may unnecessarily decrease qua lity of life and impair nutritional stat us by affecting appetite and reducing intake. Many factors influence whether a swallowing abnormality eventually results in clinically significant complications such as aspiration pneumonia. Identification of a swa llowing abnormality alone does not necessarily warrant dietary restrictions or food texture modifications. No interventions consistently prevent as piration and no tests consistently predict who will develop aspiration pneumonia. For example, tube feeding may be associated with aspiration, and is not necessarily a desirable alternative to allo wing oral intake, even if some swallowing abnormalities are present. Decisions to downgrade or alter the consistency of diets must include the resident (or the resident's representative), consider ethical issues (such as the right to decline treatment), and be based on a careful review of the resident's overall condition, correctable underlying causes of the risk or problem, the benef its and risks of a more liberalized diet, and the resident's preferences to accept risks in favor of a more liberalized food intake. Medications When a resident is eating poorly or losing weight , the immediate need to stabilize weight and improve appetite may supersede long-term medical goals for which medicati ons were previously ordered. It may be appropriate to change, stop, or reduce the doses of medications (e.g., antiepile ptics, cholinesterase inhibitors, or iron supplements) that are associated either with anorexia or with symptoms such as lethargy or confusion that can cause or exacerbate weight loss. The medical practitioner in collaboration with the st aff and the pharmacist reviews and adjusts medications as appropriate. (For additional Guidance related to medications, refer to SO M 42 CFR 483.25(l)(1), F329, Unnecessary Drugs.) Food Fortification and Supplementation With any nutrition program, improving intake via wholesome foods is generally preferable to adding nutritional supplements. However, if the resident is not able to eat recommended portions at meal times or to consume between-meal sn acks/nourishments, or if he/she prefers the nutritional supplement, supplements may be used to try to increase calorie and nutrient intake. Sin ce some research suggests that caloric intake may increase if nutritional supplements are cons umed between meals, and may be less effec tive when given with meals, the use of nutritional supplements is generally r ecommended between meals instead of with meals. Taking a nutritional supplement during medication administration may also increase caloric intake without reducing the resident's appetite at mealtime. Examples of interventions to improve food/fluid intake include: Fortification of foods (e.g., adding protein, fat, and/or carbohydrate to foods such as hot cereal, mashed potatoes, casseroles, and desserts); Offering smaller, more frequent meals; Providing between-meal snacks or nourishments; or Increasing the portion sizes of a resident's favorite foods and meals; and providing nutritional supplements. Maintaining Fluid and Electrolyte Balance If a resident has poor intake or ab normal laboratory values related to fluid/electrolyte balance, the care plan addresses the potential for hydration deficits. Examples of interventions include adjusting or discontinuing medications that affect fluid bala nce or appetite; offering a variety of fluids (water, fruit juice, milk, etc.) between meals, and encouraging and assisting resi dents as appropriate. Serving (except to those with fluid restrictions) additional beverages with m eals will also help increase fluid intake. Examples of ways to encourage fluid intake include maintaining filled water p itchers and drinking cups easily accessible to residents (except those with fluid restrictions) and offering alternate fluid sour ces such as popsicles, gelatin, and ice cream. Use of Appetite Stimulants To date, the evidence is limited about benefits from appetite stimulants. While their use may be appropriate in specific circumstances, they are not a substitute for appropriate inv estigation and management of potentially modifiable risk factors and underl ying causes of anorexia and weight loss. The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 112 Feeding Tubes Feeding tubes have potential benefits and complicati ons, depending on an individual's underlying medical conditions and prognosis, a nd the causes of his or her anorexia or weight loss. Possible feeding tube use, especially for residents with advanced dementia or at the end-of-life, s hould be considered carefully. The resident's values and choices regarding artificial nutrition should be identified and considered. The h ealth care practitioner should be involved in reviewing whether potentially modifiable causes of anorexia , weight loss, and eating or swallowing abnormalities have been considered and addressed, to the exte nt possible. For residents with dementia , studies have shown that tube feeding does not extend life, prevent aspiration pneum onia, improve function or limit suffering. End-of-Life Resident choices and clinical indications affect decisions about the use of a feeding tube at the end-of-life. A resident at the end of life may have an advance directive a ddressing his or her treatment goals (or the resident's surrogate or representative, in accordance with State law, may have ma de a decision). Decreased appetite and altered hydration are common at the end of life, and do not require interventions other than for comfort. Multiple organ system failure may impair the body's capacity to accept or digest food or to utilize nutrients. Thus, the inability to maintain acceptable parameters of nutritional status for someone who is at the e nd-of-life or in the terminal stages of an illness may be an expected outcome. Care and services, including comfort measu res, are provided based on the resident's choices and a pertinent nutritional assessment. The facility can help to support intake, to the ex tent desired and feasible, based on the information from the assessment and on considering the reside nt's choices. If individualized approaches for end-of-life care are provided in accordance with the care plan and the resi dent's choices, then the failure to maintain acceptable parameters of nutritional status ma y be an expected outcome for resi dents with terminal conditions. Monitoring: Monitoring after care plan implementation is necessary for residents with impaired or at-risk nutritional status, as well as for those whose current nutritional status is stable. Monitoring includes a review of the resident-specific factors identified as part of the comprehensive resident assessment and any supplemental nutrition assessment. Identifying and reporting information about the resident's nutritional st atus and related issues such as level of consciousness and function are obtainable through various st aff observations. For example, nursing assi stants may be most familiar with the resident's habits and preferences, symptoms such as pain or discomfort, fluctuating appetite, and nausea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. More intensive and frequent monitoring may be indicated for residents with impaired or at-risk nutritional status than for those who are currently nutritionally st able. Such monitoring may include, but is not limited to, observing for and recognizing emergence of new risk factors (e.g., acute medica l illness, pressure ulcers, or fever), evaluating consumption of between-meal snacks and nutritional supplements, and revi ewing the continued relevance of any current nutritional interventions (e.g., therapeutic diets, tube feeding orders or nutritional supplements). Evaluating the care plan to determine if current interventions are bei ng followed and if they are effective in attaining identified nutritional and weight goals allows the facility to make necessary revisions. Subse quent adjustment of interventions will depend on, but are not limited to, progress, underlying causes, overall condition and pro gnosis. The resident's current nutritional and medical status helps the staff determine the freque ncy of reweighing the resident. For exam ple, reweighing a resident within a week of initiating or substan tially revising nutritional interventions to address anorexia or weight loss assists in monitoring responses to interventions. Monitoring residents who experience unplanned weight loss, including reweighing at least weekly until weight is stable or increasing and th en routinely thereafter, helps clarify his/her responses to interventions. However in some residents, subsequent weight monitoring may not be clinically indicated (e.g., palliative care resident). Nutrition-related goals may need to be modi fied, depending on factors such as further clarification of underlying causes (e.g., when evidence sugg ests that unmodifiable factors may prevent improved or stabilized nutritional status) and responses to current interventions. In some cases, th e current plan of care may need to be modified and new or additional interventions implemented. Th e facility explains any decisions to co ntinue current interventions when the resident's nutritional status continues to decline. For exam ple, because the goal of care for someone with a terminal, advanced, or irreversible cond ition has changed to palliation. Investigative Protocols The Investigative Protocols were developed to provide direc tion for the investigative pro cess, to assist in consistent application of the regulations and to provide direction for determination of avoidable / unavoidable as appropriate. Investigative Protocols primarily related to nutrition are as follows: The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 113 NUTRITIONAL STATUS F325: Used to determine if the facility has pr actices in place to maintain acceptable parameters of nutritional status for each resident based on his/her compre hensive assessment. To determine if failure to maintain acceptable parameters of nutritional stat us for each resident was avoidable or unavoidable (the resident's clinical condition demonstrates that maintaini ng acceptable parameters is not possible). To determine if the resident has received a therapeutic di et when there is a nutritional indication. A more detailed explanation of this investigative protocol follows. PRESSURE ULCER / SORE F314: Used to determine if the identified pr essure sore / ulcer(s) is avoidable or unavoidable and to determine the adequacy of the fac ility's pressure sore / ulcer treatment and prevention interventions. USE OF PAID FEEDING ASSISTANTS F373: Used to determine, for a fa cility that uses paid feeding assistants: If individuals used as pa id feeding assistants successfully completed a State-approved training course; If sampled residents who were selected to receive assist ance from paid feeding assistants were assessed by the charge nurse and determined to be eligible to receive these services based on the latest assessment and plan of care; and If the paid feeding assistants are supervised by an RN or LPN. paid feeding assistants, including proper training and supervision of feeding assistants, and proper selection of residents for feeding assistance. MEDICAL DIRECTOR F501: Used to determine whether the facility has designated a licensed physician to serve as medical director; and To determine whether th e medical director, in collaboration with the facility, coordinates medical care and the impl ementation of resident care policies. QUALITY ASSESSMENT AND ASSURANCE F520 : Used to determine if the facility has a QAA committee consisting of the director of nursing, a physician designate d by the facility, and at least three other staff members; and To determine if the QAA committee: o Meets at least quarterly (or more often, as necessary); o Identifies quality deficiencies; and o Develops and implements a ppropriate plans of action to address identified quality deficiencies. Surveyors will review records including assessments, care planni ng and interventions; interview resident, staff/care givers and family; and conduct observations to determine compliance with the protoc ols. Detailed information for all investigative protocols can be found in the SOM. INVESTIGATIVE PROTOCOL NUTRITIONAL STATUS This protocol is to be used for each sampled resident to determine through interview, observation and record review whether the facility is in compliance with the regulation Procedures: Briefly review the RAI, care plan, and any additiona l relevant nutritional assessment information that may be available to identify facility evaluations, conclusions, and interventions to guide subsequent observations. NOTE: Record reviews prior to meal observations are conducted to note the resident's therapeutic diet, food texture and level of required assistance with meals. 1. Observation Residents are observed during the initial tour of the facility and throughout the survey process. To facilitate the investigation, information is gathered (e .g., dining style, nourishment list, schedules, and policies). During observations, surveyors may see non-traditional or a lternate approaches to dining services such as buffet, restaurant style or family style dining. These alternat e dining approaches may include more choices in meal options, preparations, dining areas a nd meal times. Such alternate dining approaches are acceptable and encouraged. While conducting the resident dining observations: Observe at least two meals during the survey; Observe a resident's physical appearance for signs that might indicate altered nutritional status (e.g., cachectic) and note any signs of dental and oral problems; Observe the delivery of care (such as assistance and encouragement during dining) to determine if interventi ons are consistent with the care plan; Observe the serving of food as planned with atte ntion to portion sizes, preferences, nutritional supplements, prescribed therapeutic diets and between-meal snacks to determine if the interventions identified in the care plan were implemented; Follow up and note differences between the care plan and interventions and Determine if staff responded appropriately to the resident's needs (e.g., for assistance, positio ning, and supervision). 2. Interview the resident, family or resident's representative to identify: Whether staff are responsive to the resident's eati ng abilities and support needs, including the provision of adaptive equipment and personal assistance with meal s as indicated; Whether the resident's food and dining preferences are addressed to the extent possible, e.g., whether the resident is offered substitutions The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 114 or choices at meal times as appropriate and in accord ance with his/her preferences; Whether pertinent nutritional interventions, such as snacks, frequent m eals, and calorie-dense foods, are provided; and If the resident refused needed therap eutic approaches, whether treatment options, related risks and benefits, expected outcomes and possible consequences were discussed with the resident or resident's representative, and whether pertinent alternativ es or other interventions were offered. Interview interdisciplinary team members on various shifts (e.g., certified nursing assistant, registered dietitian, dietary supervisor/manager, charge nurse, social worker, occupational therapist, attending physician, medical director, etc.) to determine, how: Food and fluid intake, and eating ability and weight (and changes to any of these) are monitored and reported; Nutrition interventions, such as snacks, frequent meals, and calorie-dense foods are provided to prevent or address impaired nutritio nal status (e.g., unplanned weight changes); Nutrition-related goals in the care plan are estab lished, implemented, and monitored periodically; Care plans are modified when indicated to stabilize or improve nutritional status (e.g., reduction in medications, additional assistance with eating, therapeutic diet orders); and A health care practitioner is involved in evaluating and addr essing underlying causes of nutritional risks and impairment (e.g., review of medicati ons or underlying medical causes). If the interventions defined, or the care provided, appear to be inconsistent with current standards of practice, interview one or more physicians or other licensed health care practitioners who can provide information about the resident's nutritional risks and needs. Examples include, but are not limited to: The rationale for chosen interventions ; How staff evaluated the effectiveness of current interventions; How staff managed the interventions ; How the interdisciplinary team decided to maintain or change interventions; and Rationale for decisions not to intervene to address identified needs. 3. Record Review Review the resident's medical record to determine how the facility has: evaluated and analyzed nutritional status; identified residents who are at nutritional risk; investigated and identified causes of anorexia and impaired nutritional status; identified and implemented relevant interventions to try to stabilize or improve nutritional status; identified residents' triggered Resident Assess ment Instrument (RAI) for nutritional status; evaluated the effectiveness of the interventions; and monitored and modified approaches as indicated. NOTE: Documentation of findings and conclusions related to nut ritional status may be found in various locations in the medical record, including but not lim ited to interdisciplinary progress notes, nutrition progress notes, the RAP summary, care plan, or resident care conference notes. Assessment and Monitoring Review information including the RAI, diet and medication orders, activities of daily living worksheets, and nursing, dietitian, rehabilitation, and social service notes. Determine if the resident's weight and nutritional status were assessed in the context of his/her overall condition and prognosis, if nutritional require ments and risk factors were identified, and if causes of the resident's nutritional risks or impairment were sought. Determine whether : The facility identified a resident's desirable we ight range, and identified weight loss/gain; The facility identified the significance of a ny weight changes, and what interventions were needed; there have been significant changes in the resident's overall intake; the reasons for the change were identifie d and if appropriate interventions were implemented; the facility has calculated nutritional needs (i.e., calories, protein and fluid requirements) and identified risk factors for malnutrition; the facility met those needs and if not, why; the resident's weight stabilized or improved as anticipated; The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 115 a need for a therapeutic diet was identified a nd implemented, consistent with the current standards of practice; the facility indicated the basis for dietary restrictions; the reasons for dietary changes were id entified and appropriate interventions implemented; the facility accommodated resident choice, individual food preferences, allergies, food intolerances, and fluid restric tions and if the resident was encouraged to make choices; the facility identified and addressed underlyin g medical and functional causes (e.g., oral cavity lesions, mouth pain, decayed teeth, poorly fitting dentures, refusal to wear dentures, gastroesophageal reflux, or dysphagia) of any chewing or swallowing difficulties to the extent possible; the facility identified residents requiring any type of assistance to eat and drink (e.g., assistive devices/utensils, cues, hand-over-ha nd, and extensive assistance), and provided such assistance; the facility has identified residents receiving any medications that are known to cause clinically significant medication/nutrient inte ractions or that may affect appetite, and determined risk/benefit; the facility identified and addressed to the extent possible medical illnesses and psychiatric disorders that may affect overall intake, nutrient utilization, and weight stability; the facility reviewed existing abnormal laborat ory test results and either implemented interventions, if appropriate, or provided a c linical justification for not intervening (see note in Laboratory/Diagnostic Evaluation); the resident's current nutritional status is e ither at or improving towards goals established by the care team; and alternate interventions were identified when nut ritional status is not improving or clinical justification is provided as to why current in terventions continue to be appropriate. Care Plan Review the comprehensive care plan to determine if the plan is based on the comprehensive assessment and additional pertinent nutritional assessment information. Did the facility developed measurable objectives, approximate time frames, and specific interventions to try to maintain acceptable parameters of nutritional st atus, based on the resident's overall goals, choices, preferences, prognosis, conditions, assessed risks, and needs. If care plan concerns, related to nutritional status are noted, staff responsible for care planning about the rationale for the current plan of care will be interviewed. If questions remain after reviewing available informat ion including documentation in the medical record, the surveyor will interview the resident's attending physician or licensed hea lth care practitioner or the facility's medical director (e.g., if the attending physician or li censed health care practitioner is unavailable) concerning the resident's plan of care. NOTE: Because the ph ysician may not be present in the facility and have immediate access to the resident's medical record when the surveyor has questio ns, allow the facility the opportunity to first provide any pertinent information to the physician before responding to the interview. (This should also apply to the consulting RD.) Care Plan Revision Determine if the staff has evaluate d the effectiveness of the care plan related to nutritional status and made revisions if necessary based upon the following: Eval uation of nutrition-related outcomes; Identification of changes in the resident's condition that require revised goals a nd care approaches; and Involvement of the resident or the resident's representative in reviewing a nd updating the resident's care plan. Review of Facility Practices: Examples of such activities may include a review of policies, staffing, and staff training, functional responsibilities, and interviews w ith staff (to include but not limited to management). If there is a pattern of residents who have not maintained acceptable parameters of nut ritional status without adequa te clinical justification, determine if quality assurance activities were initiated in order to evaluate the facility's a pproaches to nutrition and weight issues. The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 116 Interviews with Health Care Practitioners If the interventions defined, or the care provided, appear to be inconsistent with recognized standards of practice, interview one or more health care practitioners as necessary (e.g., physician, hospice nurse, dietitian, charge nurse, director of nursing or medical director). Depending on the issue, ask: How it was determined that chosen interventions were appropriate; Why identified needs had no interventions; How ch anges in condition that may justify additional or different interventions were addressed; and How staff ev aluated the effectiveness of current interventions. DETERMINATION OF COMPLIANCE (Appendix P) Synopsis of Regulation (Tag F325) This regulation requires that, based on the resident's comprehe nsive assessment, the facilit y ensures that each resident maintains acceptable parameters of nutritional status unless the resident's clinical condition demonstrates that this is not possible, and that to the extent possible the resident receiv es a therapeutic diet when indicated. Criteria for Compliance The facility is in compliance with 42 CFR 483.25(i), Tag F325, Nutrition, if staff have: Assessed the resident's nutritional status and identified factors that put the resident at risk of not maintaining acceptable parameters of nutritional status; Analyzed the assess ment information to iden tify the medical conditions, causes and problems related to the resident's conditio n and needs; Provided a therapeutic diet when indicated; Defined and implemented interventions to maintain or improve nutritional status that are consistent with the resident's assessed needs, choices, goals, and recognized standards of practice, or provided clinical justification why they did not do so; and Monitored and evaluated the resident's response to the interventions; and revised the approaches as appropriate, or justified the continuation of current approaches. If not, failure to maintain acceptable parameters of nut ritional status is avoidable, cite at Tag F325. Noncompliance with Tag F325 may include (but is not limited to) one or more of the following, including failure to: Accurately and consistently assess a resi dent's nutritional status on admission and as needed thereafter; Identify a resident at nutritional risk and address risk factors for impaired nutritional status, to the extent possible; Identify, implement, monitor, and modify interventions (as appropriate), consistent with the resident's assessed needs, choices, goals, and current standards of practice, to maintain acceptable parameters of nutritional status; Notify th e physician as appropriate in evaluating and managing causes of the resident's nutritional risks and impaired nutritional status; Iden tify and apply relevant approaches to maintain acceptable parameters of resident s' nutritional status; and Provide a therapeutic diet when indicated. Potential Tags for Additional Investigation If noncompliance with 42 CFR 483.25(i) has been identified, the survey team may have determined during the investig ation of Tag F325 that concerns may also be present with related process and/or structure requirements. Examples of related process and/or structure require ments related to noncompliance with Tag F325 may include the following: Tag F150, Resident Rights o Determine if the resi dent's preferences related to nutrition and food intake were considered. 42 CFR \u00a7483.20(b)(1), Tag F272, Comprehensive Assessments o Determine if the facility assessed the resident's nutritional status and the factors that put the resident at ri sk for failure to maintain acceptable parameters of nutritional status. 42 CFR \u00a7483.20(k), Tag F279, Comprehensive Care Pl ans o Determine if the facility developed a comprehensive care plan for each resident that includes measurable objectives, interventions/services, and time frames to meet the resident's needs as identified in the resi dent's assessment and provided a therapeutic diet when indicated. 42 CFR \u00a7483.20(k)(2)(iii), Tag F280, Comprehensive Care Plan Revision o Dete rmine if the care plan was periodically reviewed and revised as necessary by qualified persons after each assessment to maintain acceptable parameters of nutritional status and provided a therapeutic diet when indicated. 42 CFR 483.20(k)(3)(ii), Tag F282, Provision of Care in Accordance with th e Care Plan o Determine if the services provided or arranged by the facility were provided by qua lified persons in accordance with the resident's written plan of care. 42 CFR 483.25(j), Tag F327, Hydration o Determine if the facility took measures to maintain proper hydration. 42 CFR 483.25(k)(2), The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 117 F328, Special Needs o Determine if the facility to ok measures to provide proper treatment and care for Parenteral and Enteral Fluids. 42 CFR 483.25, Tag F329, Unnecessary Medicines o Determine if f ood and medication interactions are impacting the residents' dietary intake. 42 CFR 483.30(a), Tag F353, Sufficient Staff o Determine if the fac ility had qualified staff in sufficient numbers to provide necessary care and services, including superv ision, based upon the comprehensive assessment and care plan. 42 CFR 483.35(a)(1)(2), F361, Dietary Services - Staffing o Determine if the facility employs or consults with a qualified dietitian.

Such activities may involve a review of policies, staffing and staff training, contracts, etc. and interviews with ma nagement, for example. If there is a pattern of residents who have not main tained acceptable parameters of nutritional status without adequate clinical justification, determin e if quality assurance activities address the facility's approaches to nutrition and weight issues. DEFICIENCY CATEGORIZATION (Part IV, Appendix P) Once the team has completed its investigation, analyzed the data, reviewed th e regulatory requirements, and determined that noncompliance exists, the team must determine the se verity of each deficiency, based on the resultant effect or potential for harm to the resident. The key elements for severity determin ation for Tag F325 are as follows: 1. Presence of harm/negative outcome(s) or potential for negativ e outcomes due to a failure of care and services. Actual or potential harm/negative outcomes for F325 may include, but ar e not limited to: Significant unplanned weight change; Inadequate food/fluid intake; Impairment of anticipated wound healing; Failure to provide a therapeutic diet; Functional decline; and Flui d/electrolyte imbalance. 2. Degree of harm (actual or potential) related to the nonc ompliance. Identify how the f acility practices caused, resulted in, allowed, or contributed to the actual or potential for harm: If harm has occurred, determine if the harm is at the level of serious injury, impairment, death, compromise, or discomf ort; and If harm has not yet occurred, determine how likely the potential is for serious injury, impairment, death, compromise or discomfort to occur to the resident. 3. The immediacy of correction required. Determine whether the noncompliance requires imme diate correction in order to prevent serious injury, harm, impairment, or death to one or more residents. The survey team must evaluate the harm or potential for harm. This is based upon the levels of severity for Tag F325. First, the team must rule out whether Severity Level 4, I mmediate Jeopardy to a resident's health or safety exists by evaluating the deficient practice in relation to immedi acy, culpability, and severity. (Guidance in Appendix Q, \"Guidelines for Determining Immediate Jeopardy\".) Federal Nursing Home Regulations for Food & Nutrition Services It is important to understand all regula tions and interpretive guidelines applied to facilities, especially those that relate specifically to nutrition. The major nutrition-related F-Tags include: The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 118 F-TAG # REGULATION INTENT OF REGULATION F240 Quality of Life Specifies that a facility must care for its residents in a manner and in an environment that promotes maintenance or enhancement of each resident's quality of life. F241 Dignity Specifies facility's responsibilities toward creating/ma intaining an environment that humanizes and individualizes each resident's dignity including how each resident is treated at mealtime. F252 Environment Provide a safe, clean, comfortable and hom elike environment F256 Adequate and comfortable lighting levels in all areas Includes dining areas and visual enhancements of meals/food. F258 Sound Levels Maintain comfor table sound levels (including noise level in the dining room) F272 Comprehensive Assessment To provide the facility with information nece ssary to develop a care plan and to provide appropriate care to each reside nt The facility must conduct initially and periodically a comprehensive, accurate, standardized reproducible assessment of each resident's functional capacity. F276 Quarterly Review Assessments To assure that the resident's assessment is accurate and reflects current status, the resident's assessment is updated on at least a qu arterly basis. F278 Nutritional Status and Requirements Accuracy of Assessment \u00a7483.20(b) xi Resident's nutritional status is assessed by someone who is knowledgeable in nutrition and capable of correctly assessi ng a resident? Nutritional status refers to weight, height, hematologic and biochemical assessments, clin ical observations of nutrition, nutritional intake, resident's eating habits and preference s, dietary restrictions , supplements, and use of appliances. F279 Comprehensive Care Plans A facility must use the results of the asse ssment to develop, re view and revise the resident's comprehensive plan of care. The comprehensive care plan for each resident includes measurable objectives and timetables to meet a resident's medical, nursing, and mental and psychosocial needs that are identified in the comprehensive assessment.

SURVEY MANAGEMENT TIPS FOR THE RD: Know the current Regulations and Rules: SOM, State Rules, State Food Code, MDS Manual) (Federal, State and Local). Periodically review a copy of the QI Report to identify r esidents that will be included in the sample selection. Follow ADA Standard of Practice (SOP/SOPP) and Evidence Based Best Practice Protocols. Incorporate the ADA Nutrition Care Process (NCP ) of assessment, diagnosis, intervention and monitoring/evaluation in medical record documentation. Know previous survey information: CMS 2567 (Stateme nt of Deficiencies), OSCAR Reports, Quality Measure Quality Indicator Reports, Plan of Correction (PoC) Request that the RD be notified of the arrival of surveyors as soon as possible. The RD should be introduced to the surveyors, particul arly the one assigned to diet ary and offer assistance as needed. Provide only the information requested or information that will support the facility. Check in with the dietary surveyor from time-to-time, offering assistance or clarification of procedures or to answer any questions. Be present when the surveyor is in the kitchen. Comp lete the Kitchen Tour (Sub Task 5B) with the dietary supervisor and the surveyor. Do not disagree with the surveyors, po litely ask for their reason for the potentia l citation. Present the rebuttal in a calm manner by presenting facts and citing regulations. Attend the exit conference if the facility does not object, in order to offer further e xplanations, if necessary, and to record any problems noted by the surveyors. Correct problem areas as quickly as possible. Remember: If state regulations differ from federal, the stricter of the two prevails. A surveyor may cite any sanitation violation to the stat e food code - regardless of whether it is noted in the regulations. Interpretive guidelines are published as guidance to surveyor s and are NOT law. Deficiencies can only be cited on actual regulations, which are identified by \"tag\" numbers. Regulations are subject to change and revision. Be cer tain that the most current regulations are available. The RD and the Regulatory Process Pocket Resource for Nutrition Assessment \u00a9DHCC 2009 120 How to Obtain Information on State & Federal Regulations It is very important to be familiar with the state regulations for nursing facilities (assisted living, group homes, residentia l care, or other settings). Each state has its own set of regul ations that may vary somewhat from the federal regulations. Generally speaking, the more stringent of the two regulations takes precedence. 1. Contact the state agency responsible for licensure, cer tification and regulations of long term care facilities. 2. Contact the state department of health for information of food service laws and rules, which may be separate from the licensure and certification regulations. 3. Contact the American Health Care Association (AHCA) * 202-842-4444 or 1-800-321-0343 http://www.ahca.org 4.
