There are a number of complementary methods that can be safely used along with standard cancer treatment. These methods may help relieve symptoms or side effects, ease pain, and help you enjoy life more. While they aren't fully tested, many are not usually harmful and can be used along with your treatment. Here are examples of complementary methods that some people have found helpful and safe when used along with standard medical treatment. Be sure to talk with your cancer care team before trying any of these.
