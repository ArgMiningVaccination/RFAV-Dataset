A patient's psychological association of a smell may also play a role. It remains unclear if aromatherapy use has a transient or sustained effect.2 Additionally, it remains unclear if there is a cumulative effect after multiple uses.5 The variance in results may be because of the particular essential oil used or the symptom targeted, as each oil has differing effects based on its chemical properties.5 The effects of aromatherapy are difficult to measure and are likely to be small.2 However, aromatherapy is becoming increasingly popular and more prevalent in society1,2,13 and is also the fastest growing type of complementary therapy among nurses in the United States.3,10This column presents current knowledge about the use of aromatherapy in the acute care setting, particularly for children. Advanced practice nurses may be asked by parents or nurses to consider aromatherapy use as an adjunct when traditional therapies are not desired or are not achieving the desired effect. Advanced practice nurses may also be asked to participate in protocol development to ensure safe administration in the acute care setting.When clinicians use essential oils, they should be clear about the purpose and intended therapeutic outcome, since the chemistry of each oil determines its therapeutic properties. Table 1 explores some of the more commonly used essential oils and their therapeutic qualities. The goal for clinicians using integrative therapies should be symptom relief not cure.5 Oils should be chosen on the basis of the patient's preference and treatment goals and should be administered in a way to minimize the risk of inducing side effects.Oils are typically chosen for their perceived benefits and low risk of interactions with medications.4 The most common choices are lavender, peppermint, ginger root, sweet orange, rosemary, eucalyptus, mandarin, and Roman chamomile.4,6 Uses may include to decrease postoperative nausea and vomiting, to decrease use of rescue antiemetics, as an adjuvant to reduce pain, to promote sleep or perceived sleep quality, and to promote a general sense of well-being. Aromatherapy is starting to be combined with guided imagery to reduce fear and anxiety in children4 and has been shown to have an effect when combined with conventional treatment in children.17-19The patient's history of use of essential oils should be assessed to determine if there are any contraindications to their use. Although essential oils are natural, that does not mean that they are safe to use in all patients or in medically fragile populations.4 Most professional aromatherapists avoid the use of essential oils around newborns and would not advocate use among the neonatal intensive care unit population.4 Contraindications may include age less than 3 years, pregnancy, history of bronchial hyperactivity (asthma), or hypersensitivity leading to migraines.16It is recommended that use of essential oils in nursing practice be guided by standards and guidelines and by clinicians who have been trained in the use of essential oils.12 RJ Buckle Associates endorses 2 training programs for health professionals: the Clinical Aromatherapy for Health Professionals certification course and the Integrative Aromatherapy Certificate.20 Several organizations (eg, the Alliance of International Aromatherapists, the National Association for Holistic Aromatherapy, and the American Holistic Nurses Association) can provide guidance when nurses are learning about the use of essential oils.Development of hospital-based protocols may be advisable to ensure consistent and safe use of aromatherapy. Safe administration includes consideration of the need for informed consent, staff training, or certification; determination of which oils to use; cost; application method; education of patients; safe storage and disposal; minimization of infection control concerns; whether administration will be by physician order or nursing intervention; documentation of administration; and availability of safety data sheets.4 Supervision of administration in child patients by nurses and parents is essential.Patient education is critically important. The patient, or parents/caregivers, must understand the potential benefits versus risks of aromatherapy use and agree to accept them. Some hospitals require written authorization, whereas others only require verbal agreement.4 It is not necessary to obtain an order from a provider to institute aromatherapy.21There are many modes of aromatherapy administration (Table 2). The cognitive and developmental needs of the child must be kept in mind when determining a mode of administration. When clinicians use aromatherapy, they must consider the fact that many hospitals have fragrance-free policies in place.4 Employees with fragrance sensitivities may claim a workplace disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act if they develop symptoms such as breathing problems, skin rashes, nausea/vomiting, lightheadedness/dizziness, or headache when exposed to scents.22 The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission oversees complaints by workers; there have been several lawsuits related to reactions to aromatherapy in the work setting resulting in multimillion-dollar settlements for some workers.23Although administration via diffuser is popular in the home, diffuser use is not recommended in hospitals and may be prohibited to limit unintended exposure of others. Diffuser use can affect respiratory passages, causing irritation of mucous membranes, cough, and wheezing for the patient and anyone else in the room. Water in the diffuser chamber can contribute to hospital-acquired infections because of bacterial growth in the water if diffusers are not cleaned properly.4The most common methods of administration in the hospital are active and passive inhalation. For active inhalation, 1 to 3 drops of oil are placed on a tissue, cotton ball, or gauze, which is held near the nose for 5 to 10 minutes. The patient may breathe in as much of the scent as desired, then the scent is removed. For passive inhalation, a drop of oil is placed on the patient's sheet or pillowcase near the head. When essential oils are administered via inhalation, the scent of the oil travels through the olfactory bulb to the limbic system, where the aroma is processed.5Aromatherapy is thought to be safe and effective with few side effects; however, oils should be kept out of the reach of children. Direct contact near or in the eyes should be avoided, as oils can cause irritation.10 Those administering aromatherapy with essential oils should be cautious about touching or rubbing their eyes because oils can linger on the hands even after washing with soap and water.10 In the event of eye contact, eyes should be irrigated as quickly as possible with milk or a carrier oil (eg, olive, nut, coconut, or vegetable oil) to dilute the essential oil. Eyes should then be rinsed with copious amounts of water or saline solution for the next 1 to 2 hours to minimize chemical burn.10,24 If a skin reaction occurs, dilute the oil on the affected area with a carrier oil, then wash with nonperfumed soap.10 If an oil is taken internally, vomiting should not be induced. The nearest poison control center should be contacted while the patient is encouraged to drink whole or 2% milk.10 The essential oil bottle should be retained for identification.Essential oils should be stored in a cool, dark location with the cap tightly closed, because oils are sensitive to changes in temperature a...", "sitename": "American Association of Critical-Care Nurses", "date": "2020-06-15", "cleaned_text": "The use of integrative and complementary practices for health care has increased in the United States during the past decade.1-4 One complementary practice that has become more popular is aromatherapy, the use of concentrated essential oils extracted from aromatic plant materials (eg, flowers, herbs, leaves, bark, wood, roots, seeds, and peels) to treat illness as well as enhance psychological and physical well-being.2,5,6 The term aromatherapy was initially used by the French chemist Gattefoss\u00e9 in 1936; however, the use of distilled plant materials can be traced back to medieval Persia.6,7 In Notes on Nursing, Florence Nightingale8 described the use of aromatherapy to promote health and healing during the Crimean War.9 Although relatively new to the United States, aromatherapy is used by nurses all over the world10 and has been part of holistic nursing practice in the...
