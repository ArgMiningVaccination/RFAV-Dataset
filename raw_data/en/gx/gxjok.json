(c) When physical security controls become inadequate as a result of a controlled substance being transferred to a different schedule, or as a result of a non-controlled substance being listed on any schedule, or as a result of a significant increase in the quantity of controlled sub stances in the possession of th e registrant during normal business operations, the physical security controls shall be expanded and extended accordingly.

The prescriptions may 186 be prepared by a secretary or agent for the signature of a practitioner, but the prescribing practit ioner is responsible in case the prescription does not conform in all essential respects to the law and regulations. A corresponding liability rests upon the pharmacist who fills a prescri ption not prepared in the form prescribed by these regulations.

A drug defined in an official compendium is not considered to be adulterated under this subdivision because the drug differs from the standard of strength, quality, or purity set forth in the compendium if the drug's difference in strength, quality, or purity from the standard is plainly stated on the drug's label. If a drug is recognized in both the United States Pharmacopoeia and the Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia of the United States, the drug is subject to the requirements of the United States Pharmacopoeia unless the drug is labeled and offered for sale as a homeopath ic drug.

(B) If a prescription drug, the established name of the drug or ingred ient on the label (and on any labeling on which a name for the drug or ingredient is used) is printed prominently and in type at least half as large as that used for any proprietary name or designation for the drug or ingredient. However, to the ex tent that compliance with the requirements of clause (A)(ii) or clause (B) is impracticable, exemptions shall be allowed unde r rules adopted by the state department or by regulations promulgated under the Federal Act. (6) Unless the drug's or devic e's labeling bears: (A) adequate directions for use; and (B) adequate warnings against use in those pathological conditions or by children where the drug's or device's use may be dan gerous to health or against unsafe dosage or metho ds or duration of administration or application in the manner and form that is necessary for the protection of users.

A rule or regulation may not be established for any drug recognized in an official compendium until the federal security administrator or the state department informs the appropriate body charged with the rev ision of the compendium of the need for the packaging or labeling requirements and that body fails within a reasonable time to prescri be requirements. (9) If a drug's container is made, formed, or filled as to be misleading. (10) If a drug is an imitation of another drug. (11) If a drug is offered for sale under the name of another drug. (12) If a drug is or purports to be or is represented to be a drug composed wholly or partly of insulin, unless: (A) the drug is from a batch with respect to which a certificate or release has been issued under Section 506 of the Federal Act; and 195 (B) the certificate or release is in effect with respect to the drug. (13) If a drug is or purports to be or is repre sented to be a drug composed wholly or partly of any kind of penicillin, streptomycin, chloretetracycline, chloramphenicol, bacitracin, or any other antibiotic drug, or any derivative of those drugs, unless: (A) the drug is from a batch with re spect to which a certificate or release has been issued under Section 507 of the Federal Act; and (B) the certificate or release is in effect with respect to that drug. However, this subdivision does not apply to any drug or class of dr ugs exempted by regulations promulgated under Section 507(c) or 507(d) of the Federal Act.
