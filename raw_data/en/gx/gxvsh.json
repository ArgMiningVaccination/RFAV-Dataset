An herbal substance is a plant or part of a plant, algae, fungi or lichen, or an unprocessed exudate of a plant, defined by the plant part used and the botanical name of the plant, either fresh or dried, but otherwise unprocessed. An herbal preparation is when herbal substances are put through specific processes, which include: - extraction - distillation - expression - fractionation - purification - concentration - fermentation The herbal substance being processed can be: - reduced or powdered - a tincture - an extract - an essential oil - an expressed juice - a processed exudate (rich protein oozed out of its source). Not all herbal products are medicines, some can be classified as food supplements or cosmetics.
