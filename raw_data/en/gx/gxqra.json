Abstract On March 23, 2010, President Obama signed in to law the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA) as part of the Patie nt Protection and Affordable Care Act (also known as the Healthcare Bill). BPCIA sets up a framework for th e approval of generic biologics and provides for up to 12.5 years of market excl usivity for FDA approved bio- pharmaceutical products. The exclusivity is intende d to run in parallel and in addition to any patents that may apply to such approved bio- pharmaceutical products, which would also grant the developers of these products monopolies in the underlying technologies on which such bio-pharmaceutical products are based. This seeming \"double dipping\" raises questions regarding the need and justifi cation, if any, for such parallel, double protection of this particular class of biological products. This article seeks to address these questions. Analyzing the fundamentals and underlying assumptions of the legal regimes of patents and statutory exclusivities, this article examines their applicability to the context of bio- pharmaceuticals. Based on the conclusions reache d, this article then further examines the proposition that statutory exclus ivity regimes could become a blueprint for \"patentless\" areas * Assistant Professor, Georgia State Un iversity College of Law; J.S.D. 2011 Columbia Law School; LL.M. 2004 Columbia Law School; LL.B. 2000 Tel Aviv University; Undergraduate Diploma in Biology 2000 Tel Aviv University.

Introduction Over the past decade or so, the United States has been the arena of a boisterous debate regarding the institution of a regulatory framework for the approval of generic versions1 of biologics-based pharmaceutical products (a lso known as \"biological products\" and \"biologics\"2)3\u2014an important and increasingly growing class of drugs.4 The basic premise of 1 In this Article, the terms \"generics\" or \"generic versions\" will be used to refer to imitations and follow-on versions of already approved drug products, which are the subject of an application for marketing submitted to the FDA. Applications for generic versions of dr ug products typically attempt to rely on FDA findings of safety and efficacy reached as part of its review of the already approved version of the re levant drug product. Notably, the term \"generic biologics\" in and of itself has spawned a considerable amount of controversy as the nomenclature in the area of biologics seems to be perceived as dictating the discussion's results. See e.g. Henry G. Grabowski, David B. Ridley & Kevin A. Schulman, Entry and Competition in Generic Biologics , 28 Managerial and Decision Economics 439 n. 2 (2007), available at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=992479 (asserting that while \"[t]hroughtout the paper we refer to 'generic biologics' for the sake of symmetry with generic pharmaceuticals[,] the term \"follow-on bi ologic\" might be more appropriate, . . . given that the product might be required to complete clinical trials to demonstrate similar safety and efficacy to the originator\") ; Wendy H. Schacht & John R. Thomas, CRS Report for Congress: Follow-On Bi ologics: Intellectual Property and Innovation Issues, at 3 (2008) [hereinafter 2008 CRS Report] (\"many experts do not describe competing biologic products as \"generics,\" as is the case for small-molecule pharmaceuticals; the term \"follow-on biologic\" is commonly used instead\"); Follow-On Protein Products: Hearing before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, 110th Cong., 3 (March 26, 2007) (statement of Janet Woodcock, M.D., Deputy Commissioner, Chief Medical Officer, FDA), available at http://www.hhs.gov/asl/testify/2007/04/t20070326a.html [hereinafter Woodcock Statement] (addressing the issue of terminology and explaining why she prefers the term 'follow-on protein products'). The particular term used in the context of the new healthcare reform act to indicate an imitation of an already approved product is \"biosimilar\" (rather than \"biogeneric,\" \"generic biologic,\" the genericity of the term \"generic\" to the legal discussion of regulated imitation-products and its wide use in the context of drug law, in this Article I will use the term \"generic\" as mentioned above. 2 The FDA defines biological products as \"any virus, th erapeutic serum, toxin, antitoxin, or analogous product applicable to the prevention, treatment or cure of diseases or injuries of man.\" See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.3(h). According to the FDA Center for Biologics Ev aluation and Research (CBER), Biological products include a wi de range of products such as vaccines, blood and blood components . . . somatic cells, gene therapy, tissues, and recombinant therapeutic proteins. Biologics can be composed of sugars, proteins, or nucleic acids or complex combinations of these substances, or may be living entities such as cells and tissues. Biologics are isolated from a variety of natural sources - human, animal, or microorganism - and may be produced by biotechnology methods and other cutting-edge te chnologies . . . Biological products often represent the cutting-edge of biomedical research and, in time, may offer the most effective means to treat a variety of medical illnesses and conditions that presently have no other treatments available. . . .

Biological products, including those manufactured by biotechnology, tend to be heat sensitive and susceptible to microbial contamination. Therefore, it is necessary to use aseptic principles from initial manufacturing steps, which is also in contrast to most conventional drugs.

Accordingly, in this Article, I will use the terms \"biologics\" and \"biological products\" to refer to pharmaceutical products whose ma nufacturing involves the use of living organisms and will distinguish them from \"small molecule drugs\" (or \"drugs\" for short). For further discussion of the differences between biologics and small molecule drugs and the possible implications of these differences on frameworks for the approval of generic versions of biological products, see generally Donna M.

The importance of biologics lies in their structural and functional variety which, in turn, embodies unprecedented therapeutic promise. Already, approved biologics include \"wonder drugs\" used to treat diseases and maladies that could not be treated effectively by sma ll-molecule drugs and in many cases used to be considered fatal. Examples of biologics include anti-cancer antibodies such as Hercep tin and Avastin, anti-arthritis products such as Enbrel and Remicade, insulin products such as Humulin for the treatment of diabetes, erythropoietin products such as Procrit, clotting factor VIII for the treatment of hemophilia and Aran esp for the stimulation of growth of red blood cells in people suffering from blood disorders such as anemia.

One of the main points of contention in creating the framework for the approval of generic biologics has had to do with the length of the exclusivity period that would be granted to developers of original biol ogics during which generic competitors would not be allowed to enter the market.5 On March 21, 2010, as part of the healthcare reform, Congress 5 Since the imposition of competition on a previously monopolized market is expected to be accompanied by a drop in the price of the biological product, it is in the best interest of the monopolist to make its monopoly period as long as possible. There are a variety of positions on the appropriate length of the period of such exclusivity. Different proposals raised over the past few years proposed setting the le ngth of exclusivity period, in years, at 0, 3-6, 7, 10, 12-12.5, 12-14.5, 12-15, 13-16, 17, etc. See Gitter, supra note 2, at 615-616 (reviewing different positions on the length of exclusivity period that should be afforded to original biological products); Henry Grabowski, Follow-on Biologics: Data Exclusivity and the Balance Between Innovation and Competition , 7 Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 479, 486 (2008) [hereinafter Grabowski 2008] (advocating a data exclusivity period of 12.9-16.2 years); Henry Grabowski, Genia Long & Richard Mortimer, Data Exclusivity Periods for Biologics: Updating Prior Analyses and Responding to Critiques , http://econ.duke.edu/Papers/PDF/Data_Exclusivity_Periods_for_Biologics.pdf , at 2, 30 (2008) (reiterating Grabowski's call for a 12-16 y ear exclusivity period) [herei nafter Grabowski et al.].

Notably, in Europe, original biological products are afforded a 10-11-year statutory exclusivity consisting of 8 years of data exclusivity during which it is not possible to file applications for generic versions of the biological product, two more years of market exclusivity, during which generic applications cannot be approved, and an This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review.

See Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council, Art. 14(11) (2004). For further discussion of the European regulatory framework for the approval of generic biologics, see generally Liang, supra note 2, at 397-408; Kelly & David, supra note 3, at 122-123. 6 For purposes of the discussion in this Article, a \"statuto ry exclusivity\" is defined as the period of time designated in legislation during which the FDA or any other statutorily designated entity is barred from approving a generic version of a product or taking other action mandated in legislation which would pave the road for competition in that product. The effect of such statutory impediment is a de-facto grant of a competitive advantage to the party owning/making the original version of the product. Cf. Bruce S. Manheim et al., 'Follow-On Biologics': Ensuring Continued Innovation In The Biotechnology Industry , 25 Health Affairs 394, 394 (2006), available at http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/25/2/394 (defining \"statutory exclusivity\" as \"the period of time in which the FDA is barred from approving a follow-on product .\"). For further discussion of statutory exclusivities and the difference between them and intellectual property rights such as patents see infra Part II.A. Two examples of statutory exclusivities existing in the context of FD A regulation are those affected under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 and the Orphan Drug Act. See Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (Hatch-Waxman Act), Pub. L. No. 98-417, 98 Stat. 1585 (Codified as amended in different sections of 15, 21, 35 and 42 U.S.C.); Orphan Drug Act, Pub. L. No. 97-414, 6 Stat. 2049 (1983). For further discussion of these Acts and the statutory exclusivities they confer see infra Part II.B. 7 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-149, \u00a7\u00a7 7001-7002, 124 Stat. 1025 (2010) (adding \u00a7 the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) ch. 373, 58 Stat. 682 (1944)). See discussion infra III.B. Importantly, in February 2011, as part of its 2012 Budget Proposal, the Office of Management and Budget in the Executive Office of the President published a proposal to shorten this exclusivity period to 7 years. See Office of Management and Budget, Fiscal Year 2012 Terminations, Reductions and Savings - Budget of the U.S. Government, at 119 (\"[t]he Admini stration is proposing to give consumers more access to affordable pharmaceuticals by . . . reducing the exclusivity period fo r brand biologics to encourage faster development of generic biologics . . . Under the Administration proposal, beginning in 2012, innovator brand biologic manufacturers would have 7 years of exclusivity). Interestingly, this proposal appears to be in line with the Administration's original position on the appropriate length of statutory exclusivity that should be awarded in approved original biological products. See infra note 87. Regardless, the discussion herein is based on the law as it currently stands under BPCIA. 8 See discussion infra Parts IV.A-IV.B.

This seeming redundancy raises questions re garding the need for and purpose of having patents in inve ntions related to biologics in addition to statutory exclusivities. What justification is there, if any, for such double-layered protection in biologics? And, assuming that such justification or need for double protection does ex ist, why should pharmaceutical biologics be the only kind of technology to benefit from it? Could the statutory ex clusivity regime in pharmaceutical biologics mark the dawn of a ne w era in the protection and incentivizing of innovation and the beginning of a gradual replacemen t of the old patent system with modern schemes of statutory exclusivities; or is it just a peculiar case of a legal regime shaped by an unusually powerful industry? In this article I will seek to answer these questions. Part II of this article will review fundamental patent theory concepts necessary for the discussion and compare them w ith statutory exclusivities with emphasis on the statutory exclusivity scheme created under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Part III will describe the current regulation of biologics in the Un ited States and review the framewo rk for the approval of generic biologics under BPCIA. Compari ng statutory exclusivities and pa tent protection in the context of biologics, Part IV will discuss the \"pros\" and \"cons\" of these two regimes from a public policy perspective, address the possible ramifica tions of having both statutory exclusivities and patent protection in biologics and culminate in a call for the suspension of patent enforcement rights with relation to biological products that be nefit from statutory excl usivities afforded under BPCIA for the duration of such exclusivities. Pa rt V will include broade r conclusions regarding additional areas of technology which could benefit from the application of statutory exclusivities regimes.

Statutory Exclusivities and Patents as Mechanisms of Protecting and Advancing Technological Innovation A. Patents Dating as far back as the 15th Century,9 patents10 are time-limited monopolies granting inventors the right to exclude others from usi ng their patented inventions;11 i.e., for a predefined period of time, inventor-patentees can dictate whether and how th ird parties may practice their patented inventions and collect payments in exchange for their permission to do so. The literature on patent theory is vast, but two theo ries dominate the underlyi ng rationales for having 9 See Giulio Venetian Patents (1450-1550) , 30 J. Pat. Off. Soc'y 166, 169 (1948). 10 In the context of this Article, unless stated otherwise, re ference to \"patents\" is to the modern form of patents of invention\u2014i.e. utility patents\u2014as opposed to design patents, plant patents and other types of patents. 11 In the United States, the right to exclude includes the making, using or selling of the invention or importation of the invention into the United States. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(a). See also Fritz Machlup, Subcomm. on Patents, Trademarks, and Copyrights, & Sena te Comm. On the Judiciary, 85th Cong., 2d Sess., An Economic Review of the Patent System at 1 (Comm. Print 1958) (\"a patent confers the right to secure the enforcement power of the state in excluding unauthorized persons for a sp ecified number of years, from making co mmercial use of a clearly identified invention\"). 12 The exact rationales for having patents remain the s ubject of debate. Although it is generally accepted that inventive activity is responsive to economic stimuli, th e need for patents as effective and efficient means of providing such stimuli remains under debate. See Rebecca S. Eisenberg, Patents and the Progress of Science: Exclusive Rights and Experimental Use , 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1017, 1031 (1989) (\"[t]here is considerable empirical evidence suggesting that technological change has been an extremely important sour ce of economic growth over time, and that levels of invention are responsive to economic stimuli. But it does not necessarily follow that patent protection is necessary to preserve adequate economic in centives for invention and innovation\"). Notably, the patent theory literature recognizes additional rationales for patents. E.g. the proposition that patents are a natural right because inventors have natural property rights in their ideas and thus, to prevent theft of such ideas by unauthorized parties, society is morally obliged to afford inventors a proprietary right in their inventions that would confer exclusivity in the invention. See Machlup, supra note 11, at 21. Another so mewhat archaic rationale for patents is the proposition that patents are means of securing appropriate rewards, namely, that principles of justice This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review.

Patents as Incentive to Disclose According to this theory, patents embody a pact between inventor s and society: in exchange for revealing their inventions to soci ety and the way to utilize them, society grants inventors monopoly rights in their i nventions for a limited period of time.13 This patent theory presumes that inventors would have kept their in ventions a secret for as long as possible but the exclusivity is sufficient to convince them to disclo se and explain their inventions and thus benefit society.14 An underlying premise of this theory is that the required disclosure of the invention by the inventor, once made, will enab le the public to use the technology.15 These assumptions have been the subject of critique, especially in view of arguments that many patents withhold vital information necessary for utilizing the inventi ons without additional, sometimes substantial, research and development (R&D).16 2. Patents as Incentiv e to Invent/Invest and \"natural law\" require that inve ntors receive rewards for their inven tions proportional to the inventions' usefulness to society. See Machlup, supra note 11, at 21. 13 See Machlup, supra note 11, at 21 (the \"exchange- note 12, at 1022, 1028- 1030 (\"[i]n exchange for these exclusive rights, the patent statute requires the inventor to disclose the invention in the patent application in terms sufficient to enable others who are 'skilled in the art' to make it\"). 14 See Machlup, supra note 11, at 21; Eisenberg, supra note 12, at 1028-1030. 15 See Machlup, supra note 11, at 21. 16 See Machlup, supra note 11, at 32-33 (\"[t]he point that patent monopolies are often granted in exchange for incomplete disclosure is made by several writers . . . the unpatented secret knowledge which is necessary to use a patent is colloquially called the know how and is generally re garded as property distinct from the patent to which it applies\"); Sean B. Seymore, The Teaching Function of Patents , 85 Notre Dame L. Rev. 621, 626 (2010) (recognizing that one critique of patents is that they \"seldom teach enough so that someone can actually go out and actually do the invention without some additional work\"). This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. A modern, broadly accepted per ception of patents is as an instrument of incentivizing invention by affording inventors an extra-competitive advantage over their competitors.17 Described as \"the fundamental eco nomic justification of patents,\"18 the basic premise upon which this theory is based is that under comp etitive conditions the profit made by inventors would not be high enough to justif y their investment and that in order to make the inventive activities worthwhile to inventors, society must en sure that they are able exploit their inventions to an extent that would sufficiently compensate them for their investment of time, money and effort.19 Further evolvement of the incentive-to-invent theory views patents as vital not only for the inventive activity it self but also for the industrial ap plication of resulting inventions,20 namely for the incentivizing of financing of th e steps necessary for putting an invention on the market.21 17 See Machlup, supra note 11, at 21 (the thesis); Eisenberg, supra note 12, at 1024- 1026 (\"[t]he incentive to invent theory holds that too few inventions will be made in the absence of patent protection because inventions once made are easily ap propriated by competitors of the origin al inventor who have not shared in the costs of invention.\"). Notably, this perception of pa tents also seems to lie in the basis of the Constitutional authorization of Congress to grant patents for the purpose of promoting scientific progress. See U.S. Const. Art. I \u00a7 8 Cl. 8 ([Congress shall have Power t]o promote the Progre ss of Science and useful Arts , by securing for limited Times to . . . Inventors the exclusive Right to their . . . Discoveries\"). An important critique of the perception of patents as incentive-to-invent argues that Man would create and invent regardless of any prospect of gain. See Machlup, supra note 11, at 34 (quoting Frank W. Taussig). 18 Machlup, supra note 11, at 32. 19 Id. at 32, 37, 39 (reviewing arguments made by several scholars, including A.T. Hadley and Joseph Schumpeter); Brill, supra note 5, at 6 (\"[t]he purpose of the patent system is to ensure that the inventor of a patented product receives monopoly market conditions and can earn profit margin s sufficient to induce the R&D costs asso ciated with bringing the product to market.\"). 20 For purposes of the discussion herein, this hypothesis will be referred to as the \"incentive-to-invest\" theory. Notably, the invention/investment terminology used herein bears similarity to the distinction drawn by some scholars between \"invention\" and \"innovation.\" For example, Eisenberg refers to the incentive-to-invest offshoot of the incentive-to-invent rationale as a separate patent theory according to which patents are meant to promote This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review.

Despite extensive criticism of the incentive -to-disclose and incen tive-to-invent/invest theories,22 they offer means for evaluating the utility of patents. Thus, in examining patents in the context of biologics, I will assume that th ese patent theories are valid and capable of explaining, at least to some extent , the need for patent protection for inventions in general, and biotechnological inventi ons in particular. B. Statutory Exclusivities The classic view on monopolies, wh ether patent or otherwise, is that they are generally harmful to society, but \"a temporary monopoly gr anted to an inventor [is] a good way of rewarding his risk and expense.\"23 This maxim is equally appli cable to both patents and other \"innovation,\" namely investment in practical and commercial development of existing inventions. See Eisenberg, supra note 12, at 1024 note 29, 1037-1045. See also Robert P. Merges, Commercial Success and Patent Standards: Economic Perspectives on Innovation , 76 Cal. L. Rev. 803, 807 (1988) (\"[a]n invention refers to the practical implementation of the inventor's idea. This often takes the form of a prototype or model. An invention, then, is more than a concept (it is usually a tangible thing), but less than the fully worked out product or process first offered for sale to customers. An innovation is the 'debugged' and functional version of the invention: the version first offered for sale.\"). 21 See id . Eisenberg; Machlup, supra note 11, at 36 (\"[f]inancing the work that leads to the making of an invention may be a relatively small venture compar ed with that of financing its introduction, because costly development work, experimentation in production and experimentation in marketing may be needed before the commercial exploitation of the invention can begin\"). The incentive-to-invest theory is especially relevant to the medical products industry, in which the expense in the laboratory of identifying a promising drug or biologic is often not remotely as costly as putting it through clinical trials as required by the FDA. 22 See e.g. Machlup, supra note 11, at 22-25 (describing critiques of arguments in favor of patent protection); Eisenberg, supra note 12, at 1026-1030 (addressing the critiques on the incentive-to-disclose and incentive-to-invent theories); and 2008 CRS Report, supra note 1, at 18. It is not within the scope of this Article to go into the details of such critiques. 23 See Machlup, supra note 11, at 19. But see Brill, supra note 5, at 11 (warning from the chilling effects of too-long monopoly periods and arguing that \"excessive monopoly protection by the government creates windfalls to innovators, stifles competition and is costly to society.\").

Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. types of state-instituted monopolies, such as statutory exclusivitie s, as a way to incentivize and reward innovation.24 As mentioned above, a statutory exclusivity is a time-limited monopoly in a product or products which is the result of a bar on the en try of competitors into the product's market.25 The most significant example of statut ory exclusivities is th at of the exclusivity periods granted under the Hatch-Waxman Act.26 Creating the regulator y pathway for the approva l of generic versions of small-molecule drugs, the Hatch-Waxman Act provides for several types of statutory exclusivities. First, the Hatch-Waxman Act o ffers a five-year statut ory exclusivity period available to original drug manufacturers for re ceiving marketing approval of drugs containing therapeutic chemical co mpounds that have not been previo usly approved for medical use.27 As I 24 E.g., the sui generis rights under the Plant Variety Protection Act (PVPA), Pub. L. 91-577, 84 Stat. 1542 (1970) (codified as various sections in 7 U.S.C.) and the Semic onductor Chip Protection Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-620, 98 Stat. 3347 (codified in 17 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901 et seq. ). Notably, the arguments in favor of granting statutory exclusivities in biologics\u2014encouraging innovation and enab ling innovators to gain sufficient profit\u2014bear striking resemblance to the incentive-to-invent/invest patent rationale discussed above. See infra notes 72-73 and accompanying text. For further discu ssion of the resemblance between th e rationales for granting patents and statutory exclusivities, see infra Parts IV.C. 25 See supra note 6. In terms of their effect, statutory exclusivities are highly similar to patents. According to Machlup, patents have three characterizing features: conditionality, limitation of time and scope and their being awarded by society for a reco gnizable reason. Machlup, supra note 11, at 26 (\"most writers [writing about patents] want to make it understood that [patents] are not \"odious\" monopolies but rather See Hatch-Waxman Act, supra note 6. For an overview of the Hatch-Waxman Act and its legislative history see generally Gerald J. Mossinghoff, Overview of the Hatch-Wa xman Act and Its Impact on the Drug Development Process , 54 Food & Drug L.J. 187 (1999); Gitter, supra note 2, at 568-573. 27 See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)(ii). This exclusivity peri od is commonly known as 'New Chemical Entity' (NCE) exclusivity. During the NCE period of exclusivity, a generic version of the same drug cannot be approved. Id. However, a generic applicant may file an application for the approval of a generic version of the drug after four years by challenging the patents related to the original product under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv)(II). Such a challenge would normally prompt the filing of a lawsuit by the patent owner, which would trigger - regardless of the timing in which the challenge was made with relation to the NCE exclusivity - an additional period of 30 months (or 7.5 years from the date of approval, if the filing was made between NCE y ears 4-5) during which the FDA may not This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review.

See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iii). For furt her discussion of the NCE exclusivity period and its underlying rationale see infra Part III.C. 28 See infra note 92 and accompanying discussion. 29 See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 355(c)(3)(E)( iii)-(iv). This additional exclusivity period is meant to incentivize further investment in R&D of a known drug. 30 See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(5)(B)(iv). Notably, the benefit embodied in the 180-day exclusivity period for generic manufacturers lies in the recipient's ability to charge near-mo nopoly prices for its generic version of the drug for the duration of the 180-day exclusivity period. See Gitter, supra note 2, at 573 (noting that during the 180-day period the generic drug \"shares duopoly prices with the Brand-name drug\"). 355(j)(5)(B)(iv)(II). Thus, the Hatch-Wa xman Act itself incentivizes the challenging of patents related to the original drug product. In this respect, the Hatch-Waxman Act seeks to abolish one monopoly by offering another, shorter one. 32 The Hatch-Waxman Act is considered a great success in terms of incentivizing R& D activities and in monetary terms due to the savings attributable to the approval of generic versions of innovative drugs. See Gitter, supra note 2, at 586-587 (reviewing the reasons for what she describes as the \"overa ll success\" of the Hatch-Waxman Act); This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. Another important example of a statutory exclusivity framework is that of the exclusivities granted under the Orphan Drug Act33 to developers of drugs for rare diseases34 such as Huntington's disease, ALS (Lou Gehr ig's disease) and Tourette syndrome.35 Under the Orphan Drug Act, once an approved drug or bi ologic is approved and \"designated under [21 U.S.C \u00a7360bb] for a rare disease or condition, the [FDA] may not approve another application . . . for such drug for such disease or condition for a [generic applicant] until the expiration seven years from the date of the appr oval of the [drug or biologic].\"36 The idea behind the legislation of the Orphan Drug Act was to increase insufficien t financial incentives under patent law (if any) by supplementing it with an additional exclusivity period that would make the development of drugs for rare diseases financially feasible. 37 The addition of the statut ory exclusivity period that is the crux of the Orphan Drug Ac t is considered to have achieve d its desired effect: since its passage in 1983, more than 200 drugs and biologics for rare diseases have been brought into the market as compared with fewer than ten in the decade preceding the passage of the Act.38 Liang, supra note 2, at 365 (arguing that the Hatch-Waxman Act has been very successf ul in bringing cheaper generic versions of drugs to the market while maintaining incentives for continued innovation). 33 Orphan Drug Act, Pub.L. 97-414, 96 Stat. 2049 (1983) (codified as 42 et 34 (definition of \"rare disease or condition\"). Notably, the definition of an orphan drug could also include \"orphan\" biologics approved under PHSA \u00a7 351. 35 See Congressional Findings for the Orphan Drug Act \u00a7 1. 36 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360cc(a)(2). 37 See Congressional Findings for the Orphan Drug Act, supra note 35, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 4-5. Notably, such orphan drug products may be entirely unpatentable and could s till merit exclusivity under the Orphan Drug Act. 38 See FDA, Developing Products for Rare Diseases & Conditions , available at http://www.fda.gov/forindustry/developingpro ductsforrarediseasesconditions/default.htm ; Frank R. Lichtenberg & This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. C. Patents and Statutory Exclusivit ies\u2014Similarities and Differences The main difference between statutory exclus ivities and patents i nvolves the nature or type of \"right.\"39 Patents result from a grant by an executive agency\u2014the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)\u2014and cr eate a right to exclude othe rs from using the object of the right, namely the invention.40 A patentee's right to exclude is correlated with the duty of third parties not to use the invent ion without the patentee's permission.41 Statutory exclusivities, on th e other hand, are the result of inaction by an executive agency that effectuates a de-facto monopoly status with respect to a particular product. For example, the NCE exclusivity under the Hatch-Waxm an Act is a result of the prohibition of the FDA granting marketing approvals for generic versi ons of the original drug for a period of five years from the date of approval of that drug, ther eby effectuating a five-year exclusivity in that drug on its developer.42 In other words, the benefits of st atutory exclusivities to developers of Joel Waldfogel, Does Misery Love Company? Evidence from Phar maceutical Markets Before and After the Orphan Drug Act , 15 Mich. Telecomm. & Tech. L. Rev. 335, 348 (2009) (arguing that the Orphan Drug Act \"works\"). 39 This part of the discussion will utilize the terminology and distinctions proposed by Hohfeld. See Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld, Some Fundamental Legal Concepts as Applied in Judicial Reasoning , 23 Yale L. J. 16 (1913). 40 Notably, patents are commonly mistaken for a positive right to use an invention. The distinction between a right to use and a mere right to exclude others may be best illustrated where a patentee is unable to use their own invention but still has the right to exclude others from using it. For example, if A's invention cannot be used without B's patented technology, then A would be unable to use B's technology although it would certainly still be able to prevent C from using A's technology even if C has a license from B to use B's technology. 41 See Hohfeld, supra note 39, at 32 (quoting Lake Shore & M. S. R. Co. v. Kurtz , 10 Ind. App., 60, 37 N. E., 303, 304 (1894): \"[a] duty or a legal obligation is that which one ought or ought not to do. 'Duty' and 'right' are correlative terms. When a right is invaded, a duty is violated\"). 42 See discussion of NCE exclusivities supra note 27 and accompanying text. This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. original products are by-products of the preclusion of potential competitors by an executive agency's withholding of its permission to partake in a regulated activity.43 The difference in the nature of the right c onferred by patents and statutory exclusivities dictates two additional important di stinctions related to the enfor ceability of the respective rights and their susceptibility to legal challenges. Fr om an enforceability perspective, while patents give grantees the right to prec lude others from taking certain actions as they relate to the inventions claimed by such patents,44 statutory exclusivities are merely immunities and confer no right per se (in the narrow Hohfeldian sense) on their bearer.45 Accordingly, enforcement of patent rights necessitates activel y seeking relief from a court and, typically, requires significant investment of resources. Statutory exclusivitie s, on the other hand, are \"automatically enforced\" by the regulatory bar that preempts the entry of potential competitors into the relevant market and, thus, require no enforcement action per se on the part of the parties benefiting from them. 46 43 I.e., the FDA does not owe an original drug manufacturer a five-year monopoly status for having a new chemical compound approved for medical use. Rather, the FDA is merely obliged to refrain, for a period of 5 years, from approving generic versions of the particular chemical compound for the drug's indicated medical use. Put in Hohfeldian terms, statutory exclusivities are the result of a privilege granted to applicant A to partake in certain commercial activities requiring a license from an executive agency E. Yet, the exclusivity itself is not the result of the privilege but rather of an immunity of A from having its monopoly status changed which correlates to a non- ability of third parties C to abolish this monopoly status of A by securing approval of their own generic products from agency E. See Hohfeld, supra note 39, at 55 (discussing the concepts of immunity and disability). 44 See supra notes 11 and 40 and accompanying text. 45 It is possible to argue that from a legal standpoint the beneficiaries of statutory excl usivities could secure certain legal rights, e.g. if agency E, for some reason, goes ahead and approves an application of third party C prior to the expiration of the relevant statutory exclusivity period, applicant A may be entitled to recover damages from agency E the amount that A could have reasonably expected to gain from its monopoly status had agency E not approved C's application. In this regard, it is important to distinguish between the type of right per Hohfeld and the legal right. See e.g. Hohfeld, supra note 39, at 43-44 (explaining that there are \"innumerable cases in which the mental and physical facts . . . [are] confused w ith the legal relation which they create\"). 46 See Brill, supra note 5, at 6 (\"[d]ata exclusivity is a definitive monopoly and a government grant, as it allows the innovator's data to be protected without challenge\"); Joyce Wing Yan Tam, Biologics Revolution: The Intersection This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. Patents and statutory ex clusivities also differ in their su sceptibility to legal challenges. Patents, while presumed valid,47 are subject to several different types of challenges, including reexamination,48 defense arguments in patent infringement suits49 and suits for a declaratory judgment.50 Such challenges could and often do result in the partial or complete invalidation of the challenged patents.51 Hence, it is possible to say that patents are substantially exposed to legal challenges throughout their term. Statutory exclusivity status, however, can onl y be contested by chal lenging the relevant agency's inaction (i.e. omission), e.g., by disputing the agen cy's \"failure\" to approve an application to partake in the part icular regulated activity which is the subject of the exclusivity. Since such a challenge would essentially argue that the ag ency should have, purportedly, of Biotechnology, Patent Law, and Pharmaceutical Regulation , 98 Geo. L.J. 535, 553 (2010) (\"[m]arketing exclusivities are particularly powerful . . . This perfect monopoly protection is automatic and does not require the entity holding the market exclusivity to act\u2014a sharp contrast to patent rights, which are only enforced when the patent holder prevails in a legal action.\"). Howe ver, a party benefiting from a statutory exclusivity could attempt to preserve and possibly even extend its monopoly by filin g a citizens petition requesting the FDA to take certain actions (e.g. imposing increased testing requirements on generic applicants) or refrain from taking certain actions (e.g. approving a generic application). See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 10.30. 47 See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 282 (\"[a] be presumed valid\"). 48 See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 302-305. 49 Patent infringement suits initiated under the Hatch-Waxman Act normally fall under this category. Namely, the third party generic applicant makes a certification under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 355(j)(2)(A)(vii)(IV) that the patents covering the original drug product are \"invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use, or sale of the new drug for which the application is submitted.\" Under patent law, su ch certifications constitute acts of infringement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(e)(2). See discussion supra notes 30-31 and accompanying text. 50 Suits for declaratory judgment may be brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201, but see Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (Copeland Pure Food and Drugs Act) (Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) (FDCA) (Humphrey-Durham Act), ch. 675, 52 Stat. 1040, \u00a7\u00a7 505, 512 (1938). 51 For example, patents are susceptible to challenges involving their novelty and non-obviousness under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 102-103, their compliance with the various requirements of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, their being directed to patentable subject matter under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101, and so forth.

Having laid down some of the foundations n ecessary for a discussion of patents and statutory exclusivities in the context of biologics, I will now provide background on the regulation of biological products. III. The Regulation of Biologics in the United States A. The Approval of Biologics License Applications Under PHSA \u00a7 351 In order to introduce a biological product (inc luding biologics) into interstate commerce the product's developer must first rece ive a biologics license from the FDA.53 Under FDA 52 Under current Supreme Court Precedent, challenging execu tive agencies' inaction is lik ely to be unsuccessful. See Hackler v. Chaney , 470 U.S. 821, 831 (1 985) (\"[t]his Court has recognized on several occasions over many years that an agency's decision not to prosecute or enforce, whether through civ il or criminal process, is a decision generally committed to an agency's absolute discretion). This low likelihood of success of an attempt to challenge executive agencies' inaction is especially true in the context of drug law. See Hackler v. Chaney , 470 U.S. at 835-36 (rejecting the argument that the FFDCA's prohibitions of \"misbranding\" and the introduction of \"new drugs\" absent agency approval supply courts with \"law to apply\" and therefore do not provide a basis for judicial review of an FDA decision not to take enforcemen t action in the area of drug law). See also Brill, supra note 5, at 6 (\"[d]ata exclusivity is not challengeable in court\"). Although statutory exclusivities per se may be relatively unsusceptible to legal challenges, it is quite possible that an agency's interpretation and application of laws instituting such exclusivities would be subject to legal challenges. However, such challenges would be subject to an exacting review standard of the Chevron Doctrine. See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natu ral Res. Def. Council, Inc. , 467 U.S. 837, 842-44 (1984) (holding that \"considerable weight should be accorded to an executive department's construction of a statutory scheme. . . .\" and that so long as (1) \"Congress has [not] directly spoken to the precise question at issue\", and (2) \"the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute\" then \"the principle of deference to administrative followed.\"). 53 Under PHSA \u00a7 351(a)(1)(A), \"[n]o person shall introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any biological product unless . . . a biologics license is in effect for the biological product.\" Notably, the FDA has approved several biologics through regulatory pathways created by FFDCA, e.g. human insulin products such as Humulin \u00ae and Humalog\u00ae, human growth hormone products such as Humatrope\u00ae, Norditropin\u00ae and Saizen\u00ae and more. See Vernon et al. , supra note 4, at 59-60 (discussing approval of some biologics under the framework of FFDCA). These biologics have mostly been well known, less structurally-complex compounds and, in some cases, This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review.

However, such cases are an exception to the general rule that biologics are subject to the approval proc esses set forth primarily in PHSA and it is likely that the formation of a regulatory pathway for the approval of generic biologics under BPCIA ( see infra Part III.C) would marginalize even further. Thus, in analyzing impli cations of BPCIA, I will assume that future regulation of biologics is going to be done almost primarily, if not exclusively, under PHSA. 54 See PHSA \u00a7 351(a)(2)(B)(i)(I); 21 601.25, 601.27 and 601.70. For further discussion of the typical length of the development of biological products see infra Part IV.A. 56 See Joseph A. DiMasi & Henry G. Grabowski, The Cost of Biopharmaceutical R&D: Is Biotech Different? 28 Manage. Decis. Econ. 469, 475 (2007) (estimating the cost of putting a typical biologic on the market, including taking under account success in obtaini ng regulatory marketing approval, at around $1.24-1.33 billion (2005 US$)) [hereinafter DiMasi & Grabowski]; Gitter, supra note 2, at 567, 589 (reviewing the significant investment required from biologics' manufacturers as compared to small-molecule drugs); Katlikoff, supra note 5, at 8 (\"bringing a new biologic medication to market is exceptionally expensive\u2014an estimated $1.24 billion.\"); Vernon et al. , supra note 4, at 66-68 (discussing the high costs involved in the development and manufacturing of biologics). Notably, these high development costs are at least partially attributable to the fact that only about one in three biological products that start clinical trials even tually receive FDA approval. See BIO White Paper, supra note 2, at 4 (\"it is estimated that less than a third of the biopharmaceuticals that en ter clinical trials ever receive marketing approval\"). 57 The annual price of some biologics tends to be very high and some of them could even cost over $100,000, and in rare instances even ov er $300,000 a year. See Kathleen R. Kelleher, FDA Approval of Generic Biologics: Finding a Regulatory Pathway , 14 Mich. Telecom. & Tech. L.

While the high prices of biologi cs may be justified, they also give rise to concerns of possible abuses of market positi on by manufacturers of original biologics. So me commentators have argued that manufacturers of original biolog ical products use the high entry barriers into the biologics' market58\u2014the result of the significant time, mone y and expertise necessary in order to put biologics on the market\u2014to char ge very high prices for their products well after they have recouped their development costs.59 One of the proposed solutions for this perceived market failure is the creation of a regul atory pathway for the approval of generic versions of biologics.60 B. Regulatory Pathways for the Appr oval of Generic Pharmaceuticals\u2014 Background As demonstrated by the generic scheme created under the Hatch-Waxman Act, regulatory frameworks for the approval of generic pharmaceuticals are established on the premise that http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/opinion/23sun3.html (discussing the high annual cost of some biologics used for treating rare diseases); Shapiro, supra note 4, at 4 (listing the high costs of several prominent biologics). 58 See Gitter, supra note 2, at 589-590 (recognizing the high entry barriers faced by generic manufacturers seeking to enter the biologics market); Sarah Sorscher, A Longer Monopoly for Biologics?: Considering the Implications of Data Exclusivity as a Tool for Innovation Policy , 23 Harv. J.L. & Tech. 285, 304 (2009) (discussing the high entry barriers into the generic biologics market, especially as compared to the entry barrie rs faced by manufacturers of generic small-molecule drugs). 59 See Dinh, supra note 3, at 79 (\"[b]esides the expenses of R&D and clinical trials, the high cost of biologics results from monopoly pricing of brand-name biologics . . . after patent expiration because the regulatory approval process delays the market entry of competing products.\"); Kelleher, supra note 57, at 252-253 (arguing that biologics are unjustifiably expensive and that the lack of competition in biologics costs the U.S. economy billions of dollars annually). 60 The institution of a regulatory pathway for the approval of generic versions of an already approved drug was the solution chosen for a similar problem in the context of small-molecule drugs. See Hatch-Waxman Act, supra note 6. The legislation of the Hatch-Waxman Act (and the creatio n of the generic pharmaceutical industry that followed) was the result of the growing awareness during the 1970s and early 1980s to a similar situation that existed with relation to small-molecule drugs. For additional possible solutions to the market failure existing in the area of biologics see Sorscher, supra note 58, at 301-302 (reviewing additional mechanisms for addressing the problem of diminished competition in the biologics market such as cost-sharing and prize funding that could potentially facilitate access to proprietary bi ological products' clinical data and manufacturing know-how).

In other wo rds, regulatory frameworks for the approval of generic versions of pharmaceuticals seek to save the high development costs involved in putting a candidate compound through all the stages of dr ug development by simply ensuring its identity to or interchangeability with the original product.63 Such identity or interchangeability, in turn, is deduced based on comparison of the or iginal product with the generic product.64 61 See Dawn Willow, The Regulation of Biologic Medicine: Innovators' Rights and Access to Healthcare , 6 Chi.- Kent.

Prop. 32 (2006) (\"[t]he principle underlying [a determination that two compounds have the same safety and efficacy profiles] is that th e greater the degree of similarity or identity between the two [compounds], the greater the confidence that their clinical performan ce will be similar or the same.\"); BIO White Paper, supra note 2, at 10 (\"[b]eing identical to the innovator product allows FD A to rely on the innovator's safety and effectiveness data in determining that the generic version of the product will be safe and effective.\"). 62 See FTC Report, supra note 5, at ii (\"[d]uplication of safety and ef ficacy information is costly, an inefficient use of scarce resources, and, as the FDA has explained, rais es ethical concerns associat ed with unnecessary human testing\"); Woodcock Statement, supra note 1, at 6 (\"[b]y establishing that the drug product described in the [generic application] is the same as the approved innovator drug pr oduct, the []applicant can rely on the Agency's finding of safety and effectiveness for the approved drug. Therapeutic equivalents can be expected to have the same clinical effect and safety profile when administered to patients under the conditions specified in the labeling.\"). 63 Notably, the ability to achieve such identity or compar ability between the biological compounds in the original biologic and the ones in a later, generic version of the biologic, thereby allowing recognition of the generic version of the biologic as interchangeable with the original produc t, has been a point of significant scientific and legal disagreement. For further discussion of the issue of biosimilarity and bioequivalence of biological compounds see Gitter, supra note 2, at 590-609 (arguing that current scientif ic knowledge enables making determinations regarding comparability of two biologics sufficient to justify an abbr eviated regulatory pathway for the approval of protein- based biological products and making the case for such regulation); 2008 CRS Report, supra note 1, at 7-9 and 22- 23 (describing the scientific and legal dispute regarding co mparability of biological products); Woodcock Statement, supra note 1, at 1, 4 and 7-12 (stating that there is general recognition that the idea of \"sameness\" is not applicable to biologics in the same manner it is to small molecule drugs, addressing the FDA's definitions for the terms \"comparability,\" \"therapeutic equivalents\" and \"interchang eability\" and reviewing the scientific challenges involved in comparing proteins and approving two biologics as substitutable/interchangeable); Liang, supra note 2, at 370-78, 415-17 (reviewing the difficulties in replicating biological compounds and the resulting safety concerns arising in the context of generic biologics); Marr, supra note 57 (describing the debate surrounding the ability to achieve and This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review.

However, regulatory pathways for the approva l of pharmaceutical pr oducts also invite free-riding by generic manufactur ers who do not participate in the substantial investment normally involved in the R&D of pharmaceutical products.65 Thus, it is necessary to ensure that developers of original pharmaceuticals are able to recoup their investment and reap profits sufficient to incentivize them to continue their R&D efforts. Both the Hatch-Waxman Act and BPCIA rely (at least to some extent) on statutory exclusivities for this purpose.66 T h e s e exclusivities, despite differences in their length and scope, all essentially guarantee that for a certain amount of time the government will not allo w potential competitors to enter the relevant market or take steps toward doing so.67 show similarity in biologics); Dinh, supra note 3, at 90-94 and 114-15. Notably, the enactment of BPCIA seems to accept the premise that there is, percei vably, a way to achieve and ascertain identity or similarity between two biological compounds. 64 The comparison is of both the st ructures of the respective compound s and their physiological effects. See Willow, supra note 61 (\"[b]y establishing that the drug product described in the [generic application] is the bioequivalent of the innovator drug product approved [by the FDA], the [gen eric] applicant can rely on the FDA's finding of safety and effectiveness previously de termined for its counterpart brand drug.\"). Notably, the generic applicant does not and is not expected to acquire the act ual clinical safety and efficacy data for the original pr oduct, which\u2014while submitted to the FDA as part of the approval process of the original product\u2014is consider ed proprietary, but rather \"refers\" the FDA to such data al ready in the FDA's possession. See discussion infra note 160 \u00b62. 65 See 2008 CRS Report, supra note 1, at 20-21 (demonstrating the differen ces in cost and risk between development of an original new pharmaceutical and a generic version thereof). 66 See, respectively, supra Part II.B and infra Part III.C. I will argue later in this article that the statutory exclusivities afforded to developers of original pharmaceu ticals under the Hatch-Waxman Act are different from the ones instituted under BPCIA not only in their length - 3- 6 years as compared to 12-12.5 years respectively - but also in their purpose and in the extent of protection that they afford to the interests of developers of original pharmaceutical products. See discussion infra Part III.C. 67 It is common to refer to two main types of exclusivities in the context of regulatory frameworks for approval of generic pharmaceuticals products: (1) \"mar ket exclusivity\" (also sometimes referr ed to as \"approval exclusivity\"): a period during which potential competitors are not allowed to enter the particular product's market, which is typically enforced by a prohibition on the FDA to approve applications for comparable products for the duration of the exclusivity period. (Notably, market exclusivity granted to a generic product is sometimes referred to as \"generic exclusivity.\"); and (2) \"data exclusivity,\" which is a period of time during which potential competitors may not rely on FDA findings of safety an d efficacy of an earlier approv ed product necessary to suppo rt the generic application, This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review.

The Framework for the Approval of Ge neric Biologics Under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act With the increase in the prevalence of biologics,68 there have been increasing calls and proposals for the institution of a framework for the approval of generic versions of biologics.69 As could be expected, some of these proposals were more favorable to generic manufacturers while others better represented the interests of developers of origin al biological products.70 Yet, which is typically enforced by a prohibition on submission of generic applications for the duration of the exclusivity period. See Mossinghoff, supra note 26, at 189 (explaining that a period of exclusivity during which a generic version of a drug cannot be approved is genera lly referred to as \"data exclusivity\"); Gitter, supra note and \"generic exclusivity\"); Kotlikoff, supra note 5, at 3, 5 (explaining what data and market exclusivities are). Notably, the terms \"market excl usivity\" and \"data exclusivity\" have been defined rather loosely in the literature and sometimes have different meanings. See e.g. Gitter, supra note 2, n. 108 (referring to \"data exclusivity\" as the period duri ng which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug). The Hatch- Waxman Act establishes three market exclusivity periods (f ive years for NCE, three year s for approval of a known drug for a new indication and 180 days for approval of a gene ric version further to challenging the patents related to the original drug) and a data exclusivity period of four to five years. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 355(j)(5)(F)(ii)-(iv). 68 See supra note 4. 69 See supra note 3. Some prominent proposals for the institution of a regulatory pathway for approval of generic versions of biologics include H.R. 1038, 110th Cong., Access to 14, 2007) ('ALSMA'); H.R. 1956, 110th Cong., Patient Protection and Innovation Biologic Medicines Act of 2007 (introduced Apr. 19, 2007) ('PPIBMA'); S. 1695, 110th Cong., Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of June 26, 2007) ('BPCIA 2007'); H.R. 5629, 110th Cong., 2008) ('PFBA'); H.R. 1427, 111th Cong., Promoting Innovation and Access to Life-Saving Medicine Act March 11, 2009) ('PIALSMA'); H.R. 3590, 111th Cong., Biologics Price Competition and Innovation of 2009 \u00a7\u00a7 7001-7002 (introduced Sep. 17, 2009) ('BPCIA'); (introduced Sep. 17, 2009) ('PPACA') (the Senate vehicle for healthcare reform legislation; passed Senate by a Yay- Nay vote 60-39 on December 24, 2009); H.R. 3962, 111 th Cong., Affordable Health Care for America Act \u00a7\u00a7 2575-2577 (introduced Oct. 29, 2009) ('AHCAA') (highly similar to BPCIA). See also PBA, supra note 7. 70 E.g. ALSMA and PIALSMA were considered more \"p ro-generic\" as they generally set more lenient comparability standards, shorter exclusivity periods for original products and better incentives for potential competitors to enter the market than \"pro-innovators\" bills such as PPIBMA and PBA, which set stringent comparability standards and long exclusivity periods for developers of original biological products. See ALSMA, relevant sections to be added as PHSA \u00a7\u00a7 351(k)(4) and (10); PPIBMA, relevant PHSA \u00a7\u00a7 351(k)(2)(D) and (3)-(6); PIALSMA, \u00a7\u00a7 351(k)(1)-(3), (5)(B) and (8)-(11); and added as PHSA \u00a7\u00a7 351(k)(2), (4), (6)-(7) and (9). This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. almost all of the proposals mandated the institu tion of some statutory exclusivity periods in original biologics, and especially a ma rket exclusivity period of 12-15 years.71 The reoccurrence of a twelve-year period in many of the proposals has not been coincidental. Rather, it was the result of a pe rception that \"the eff ective patent life for pharmaceuticals\u2014the time remaining following F DA approval\u2014is approximately eleven to twelve years.\"72 Thus, an exclusivity period of a bout 12 years would presumably provide developers of original biologics with the assurance that the re turn on their investment would justify the time, money, and effort they expended in developing their products.73 Notably, this 71 Under PPIBMA, developers of original biologics would have received exclus ivity and PIALSMA, up to six years. The exception was ALSMA that did not provide for exclusivity to developers of original biologics. The length of exclusivity periods to be afforded to original biologics also was the subject of a heated debate regarding the optimum period of delay of generic entry into the market. See Gitter, supra note 2, 613-616 (reviewing some of the proposals for exclusivity periods in original biological products). While it is beyond the scope of this Article to assess what is the \"optimum period\" of monopoly in the context of biologics, notably, according to Machlup, \"there will always be the possibility of very expensive de velopments that cannot be profitable even if a 30- or 50-year monopoly grant were promised.\" See Machlup, supra note 11, at 39. 72 See FTC Report, supra note 5, at vi (\"[t]he economic model put forth by pioneer drug manufacturers to justify [a 12-14-year exclusivity period] is based on the average time required to recoup the investment to develop and commercialize a typical biologic drug\"); Grabowski 2009, supra note 5, at 4 (\"[t]he average market exclusivity period for small molecule drugs in the United St ates is approximately twelve years.\"); Gitter, supra note 2, at 616. But see Brill, supra note 5; Kotlikoff, supra note 5. 73 See Kelleher, supra note 57, at 256 (\"[b]iologics cost more to produce than [small-molecule] drugs, and thus a five-year market exclusivity similar to the Hatch-Waxman provision may not be long enough to incentivize the development of biologics . . . some have suggested that a twelve-year market exclusivity for pioneer biologics would be optimal because traditional drugs gene rally have slightly under 12 years of market exclusivity due to patent protection\"); Kelly & David, supra note 3, at 139-140 (\"[a] 12 to 14 year period of innovator exclusivity is not arbitrary: studies have shown that the point at which an innovator biological drug becomes profitable (the 'break-even' point) is between 12 .9 and 16.2 years.\").

As I will argue later in this Article, for these same reasons (as well as others) patent protection for the underlying inventions related to biological products should be foregone during the period of statutory exclusivity under BPCIA. See infra Part IV.C.1. 75 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u00a7\u00a7 7001-7003 (2010). 76 See Sheryl Gal Stolberg and Robert Pear, Obama Signs Health Care Overhaul Bill, With a Flourish , N.Y. Times, March 23, 2010, available at http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/ 24/health/policy/24health.html . Notably, as discussed earlier, less than one year later, in February 201 1, the same administration seem s to have backed out of its earlier endorsement of BPCIA's twelve-year exclusivity period and is currently trying to limit this exclusivity period to seven years. See supra note 7. 77 BPCIA is almost identical to BPCIA 2007 introduced two years earlier by the late Senator Ted Kennedy and cosponsored by Senator Orrin Hatch and former Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. See Library of Congress website, available at http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/thomas ('Thomas'). 78 Codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262. 79 Under BPCIA, term 'biosimilar' or 'biosimilarity' means that \"the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components\" and that \"there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the [original] product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product.\" See BPCIA \u00a7 term 'interchangeable' or 'interch angeability' means that \"the biological product may be substituted for the reference product without the interv ention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product.\" See BPCIA \u00a7 7002(b) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(i)(3)). This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review.

See BPCIA \u00a7 (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262). BP CIA sets up numerous elaborate conditions and requirements for the establishment of biosimilarity to and/or interchangeability with a reference product. See id. (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 262(k)(2)-(4)). 83 See supra note 80. A determination of interchangeability is the essence of generic legislation and the prize sought after by generic applicants. Once made, the interchangea bility determination facilitates the \"interjection\" of the generic biological product into the existing market for the original product and enables it to benefit from the reference product's client base. 84 BPCIA \u00a7 7002(a) (codified at 42 at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(k)(7)(B)). Under BPCIA, during this period, generic applicants may not submit applications for the approval of their versions of biologics biosimilar to original biological products. For further discussion of data exclusivity, see supra note 67. This interpretation of the BPCIA sections relating to the exclusivities grant has been contested and argued to be mistaken by a group of members of the House of Representatives who are identified as proponents in Congress of the brand-name pharmaceutical companies. See Letter from Reps. Anna Eshoo, Jay Inslee and Joe Barton to the Food and Drug Administration dated Dec. 21, 2010 (\"Eshoo le tter\"). The stance advanced in the Eshoo letter is that BPCIA \"does not provide 'market exclusivity' for innovator products. Rather, it provides data exclusivity for 12 years from the date of FDA approval.\" Id. The Eshoo letter does not directly explain what the difference between the 12 and 4 year exclusivities established under BPCIA is but indirectly comments that \"[BPCIA] does not prohibit or prevent another manufacturer from developing its own data to justify FDA approval of a similar of [ sic] competitive product.\" Id. The positions taken in the Eshoo letter have been criticized as opposed to good public policy as well as to the simple language of BPCIA. See e.g. Letter from Senators Sherrod Brown, John McCain, Charles Schumer and Tom Harkin to Dr. Margaret Hamburg, Commissioner of the FDA, dated January 24, 2011. Notably, as a post-enactment statement, the FDA is not obliged to give the positions expressed in the Eshoo letter substantial weight in its construction of the statutory language of BPCIA. See Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 530 n.27 (2007) (endorsing the position that \"post-en actment legislative history is not only oxymoronic but inherently entitled to little weight\"). Moreover, even if one is to ignore the non-confor mity between the construction suggested in the Eshoo letter and the language of BPCIA itself, the Eshoo letter's statutory construction fails to This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. and four-year data exclusivity by an addition al six-month period for having the biological product tested and approved for use in pediatric populations.86 Thus, BPCIA creates market exclusivity periods in original biological products of up to 12.5 years and data exclusivity periods of up to 4.5 years.87 Importantly, the statutory excl usivities established under BPCIA do not guarantee exclusivity to an original deve loper of a biological product where another, different (later) developer may seek approval for its own version of the same biological compound for the same medical condition by conduc ting its own clinical trials; independently taking its product through the FDA approval proce sses irrespective of and without seeking to rely on the approval of the earlie r \"original\" biological product.88 In addition, BPCIA establishes market ex clusivity periods of 12-42 months for a manufacturer of a first biolog ical product approved as interc hangeable with the reference product.89 explain the difference between the 12 and 4 year statutory ex clusivities. In other words, if the twelve-year statutory exclusivity is in fact data exclusivity, it appears to rend er the four-year statutory ex clusivity established by the following subsection of BPCIA redundant. Accordingly, for at least this reason it is unlikely that the FDA would adopt the statutory exclusivity proposed in the Eshoo letter. 86 BPCIA \u00a7 7002(g) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(m)). 87 Notably, the passage of BPCIA with its 12-12.5-year market exclusivity and 4-4.5-year data exclusivity periods is at odds with the Obama Administration's outspoken opposition to such exclusivity periods, which it perceived as too long. See Letter from Nancy-Ann DeParle, Director, Office of H ealth Reform and Peter Orszag, Director, Office of Management and Budget to Representative Henry A. Waxman (June 24, 2009), available at http://energycommerce.house.gov/Pres s_111/20090625/biologicsresponse.pdf (expressing the Obama Administration's position that an exclusivity period for orig inal biological products of seven years \"strikes the appropriate balance between innovation and competition\"). 88 This scenario may come to be where the market for the biological product is large enough to financially justify taking the product through another, separate regulatory approval by the FDA rather than wait for the lapse of the applicable BPCIA statutory exclusivity periods. 89 BPCIA \u00a7 7002(a) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(k)(6)). The determination of a market exclusivity period that would be afforded to a generic manufacturer depends on several factors, including whether a patent infringement This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. Importantly, while the underlying rationales for market exclusivity under BPCIA and the 5-year NCE statutory exclusivity under the Ha tch-Waxman Act (on which the BPCIA market exclusivity is modeled) are similar, their function/\"mechanism of action\" is different. In both cases, the intention was to provide develope rs of pharmaceutical products with sufficient incentives to invest in R&D. 90 However, while the 5-year NCE statutory exclusivity was meant to work its effect where no incentives existed from a patent perspective (e.g. where the drug product contains a well known active compound that is not patentable),91 the 12-12.5-year market exclusivity under BPCIA appears to have b een devised as a \"fallback\" option to patents, namely, as \"insurance\" in case they fail.92 lawsuit was filed subsequent to the filing of the generic application for the approval of the biological product at bar and its outcome and the marketing status of such product. Id. 90 For the idea behind the NCE exclusivity established under the Hatch-Waxman Act, see Allan M. Fox and Alan R. Bennett, The Legislative History of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 at 60 (1987) (\"[t]he original Waxman Committee version . . . would have allowed granting four years of market exclusivity only to new chemical entities that for technical or scientific reasons are unpatentable\") and Remarks of Rep. Waxman, House Floor Debate, Cong. Rec. of Sep. 6, 1984, at H9113-H9114 (\"the amendment provides a 5- year period of exclusive market life fo r drugs approved for the first time after enactment of the legislation. This provision will give the drug industry the incentives needed to develop new chemical entities whose therapeutic usefulness is discovered late when little or no patent life remains.\"). For the idea behind the market exclusivity established under BPCIA see supra notes 72-73 and accompanying text. 91 See id. Fox and Bennett . 92 Notably, proponents of long market exclusivity periods in biological products have described such exclusivity as an \"insurance policy\" in case patents would fail. See infra note 144 and accompanying text. In other words, rather than provide protection in addition to patents or in case patents cannot be obtained, market exclusivity under BPCIA is meant to provide an \"iron-clad, litigation-proof\" protection of the interests of developers of biological products in case their patents fall short. An interesting question, which exceeds the scope of this article, is whether statutory exclusivities could be classified as proprietary rights\u2014possibly a new kind of property\u2014and what would be the implications of such classifications. This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. BPCIA also creates an intricate dispute resolu tion scheme for patent disputes arising in relation to the submission of applications for a pproval of biological products as biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product.93 Under BPCIA, within twenty days after acceptance of an application for a generic biologic by the F DA, the generic applicant is required to provide legal representatives of the reference product s ponsor and other potentia l adversaries, under a duty of confidentiality, a copy of the application and additional information regarding the process used to manufacture the biological product. 94 Within sixty days after receipt of the information from the generic applicant, the refe rence product sponsor is required to (1) provide the generic applicant with a list of all patents for which the re ference product sponsor believes a claim of patent infringement c ould reasonably be asserted agai nst the generic applicant if it engaged in the making, using, offering to sell, se lling or importation of the generic biological product, and (2) identify which of these patents it would be prepar ed to license to the generic applicant.95 BPCIA then stipulates th at within sixty days of receipt of the reference product sponsor's patent list, the generi c applicant may (but does not ha ve to) provide its own \"counter- list\" of patents with respect to which it believes a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted by the reference product sponsor.96 For each patent on the reference product sponsor's list and the generic appl icant's counter-list, the generic a pplicant is required to provide 93 Id.

First, BPCIA stipulates that within thirty days of the exchange of patent lists between the refere nce product sponsor and generic applicant or of the date of reaching an agreement on patents that would be the subject of an infringement action, the reference product sponsor is required to bring a patent infringement 97 Id.

If the parties fail to reach an agreement, BPCIA sets up an elaborate mechanism to decide on the number and identity of such patents that would be the subject of such an infringement action. See id.

Patent vs. Statutory Exclusiv ities in Biologics: A Timeline The R&D and approval of biologics, from the first synthesizing of the biologic or a closely related compound through th e approval of the BLA by the FDA,105 is a long process which typically spans over a period of over a decade.106 Although all development projects are different, a rough estimate of a typical timelin e for the development of a biological product consists of about 4-5 year s of preclinical studies,107 6-9 years dedicated to cl inical trials prior to 105 Notably, one may also view the development of drugs and biologics as an ongoing process that includes further R&D subsequent to marketing approval by the FDA. See http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/glossary#phaselv (defining phase IV clinical studies as \"[p]ost-marketing studies to delineate additional information including the drug's risks, benefits, and optimal use.\"). 106 Grabowski 2008, supra note 5, at 481 (illustrating the length of the development process of biologics with the example of the anti-cancer biologic Avastin, whose active compound, bevacizumab, took about 15 years to develop and have approved by the FDA); Vernon et al. , supra note 4, at 68 (\"[b]ringing a single new product to market requires huge sums of investor capital and often takes well over a decade). See also infra Part IV.B (discussing my finding that the average number of days between the filing of the first patent application pertaining to a biological product, which is indicative of R&D activities, and FDA appr oval of the product as pertaining to the seventy-nine biological products listed in Appendix A is 3728 days, i.e. about 10.2 years). 107 See Dennis S. Fernandez et al., The Interface of Patents with the Regulatory Drug Approval Process and How Resulting Interplay Can Affect Market Entry , in ipHandbook of Best Practices 965, 966 (Krattiger et al. eds., 2007) (\"[p]reclinical studies take an averag e of five years\"); Grabowski 2008, supra note 5, at 486 (stating that preclinical R&D requires 4-5 years to produce several lead candidates); DiMasi & Grabowski, supra note 56, at 475, Table 3 (estimating that the time spent on preclinical studies of candidate biological products is about 52 months). \"Preclinical studies\" are the earliest phase in drug development beginning right after the identification of a candidate-compound and concluding with the filing of an i nvestigational new drug application (IND) with the FDA. This step normally includes in-vitro and animal testing of the tested compound, pharmacodynamic studies and more. See Fernandez et al. at 966 (describing the discovery phase and preclinical studies of new drugs). Once an IND is submitted, unless the FDA places a hold on the IND, the app licant may begin clinical trials after thirty days. See 21 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 312.40(b)(1), 312.42. About 85% of all drugs for which an IND is filed are eventually approved for testing in clinical trials. See Fernandez et al. at 966.

Phase I involves testing the candidate compound on humans for the first time for safety, determination of a dosage range and identification of potential side effects and incl udes about 20-80 healthy indi viduals; Phase II involves testing the drug/biologic on about 100-300 volunteers having the condition that the drug/biologic is meant to treat to determine if it is effective and to further evaluate its safe ty; Phase III for different drugs/biologics varies greatly but normally involves 1000-3000 patients and is meant to confirm the drug/biologic's effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare the drug to commonly used treatments, an d collect information that will allow the drug/biologic to be used safely. See National Institutes of Health, Understanding Clinical Trials , http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/info/understand#Q18 ; telephone interview with FDA, CBER representative, Feb. 23, 2010 (on file with author) [hereinafter CBER interview]; 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 312.21. Notably, estimates of the length of the different phases of clinical trials vary among different commentators. According to Fernandez et al. Phase I could take, on average, from 1-3 years, Phase II: 2 years and Phase III: 3-4 years. See id. Fernandez et al. at 966. According to an unofficial estimate by a CBER staff-member, Phase I takes a bout one year on av erage, Phase II about two and Phase III, while varying greatly and depending on the amount to testing done by the applicant, normally takes, on average, about 3 years. See id. CBER Interview. Grabowski and DiMasi estimate that clinical trials take an average of about 6.8 years. See DiMasi & Grabowski, supra note 56, at 473, Figure 2 (estimating the time spent on clinical development of biologics at about 82 months). 109 See id. CBER interview; DiMasi & Grabowski, supra note 56, at 473, Figure 2 (estimating the time spent on approval of biologics at about 16 months). 110 This calculation is based on adding the estimated 4-5 years of preclinical studies, 6-9 years of clinical trials and 1-1.33 years it takes the FDA to approve BLAs and then roun ding the result (11-15.33 year s) to the closest half-year increment. 111 This calculation is based on adding the estimated 11-15.5 years it takes to put a typical biologic on the market to the 4-4.5 years of data exclusivity under BPCIA. 112 This calculation is based on adding the estimated 11-15.5 years it takes to put a biologic on the market to the 12- 12.5 years of market ex clusivity under BPCIA.

Viewing the abovementioned timeframes from a patent perspective, it is important to acknowledge several additional milestones. First, biologics may be and often are the subject of numerous patents that typically cover (1) specific biological compounds, namely the purified active biological compounds themselves (most fr equently, proteins), th eir precursors, possible metabolites and other derivatives,113 (2) processes of making these compounds,114 (3) formulations containing the compounds,115 and (4) methods of usi ng the biological compound in the treatment of illnesses.116 Since the natural course of de velopment of most biologics first involves the identification, making and isolation of a biologic havi ng therapeutic properties (not necessarily in that order), the first patent ap plications commonly seek to claim the biological API, closely related compounds and methods of making them and are file d very early in the development process,117 typically between the time immediatel y pursuant to the identification of 113 See Parke-Davis & Co. v. H.K. Mulford & Co., 189 F. 95 (103((C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1911) (L. Hand, J.), aff'd in part and rev'd in part , 196 F. 496 (2d Cir. 1912) (holding that the purified form of adrenalin\u2014a compound existing in the human body\u2014was patentable because the purification pro cess transformed it into drug and therefore into \"a new thing commercially and therapeutically\"); Amgen, Inc. v. Chugai Pharm. Co., 927 F.2d 1200, 1206 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (holding that naturally occurring DNA sequences constitute patentable subject matter when \"purified and isolated\" as compared to their natural form); but see Association for Molecular Pathology, et al. v. United States Patent and Trademark Office, et al. , 702 F.Supp.2d 181 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). 114 See Gitter, supra note 2, at 610 (reviewing the types of patents available to developers of biological products). 115 See Gitter id. Formulations are the compositions of the final product, namely the active pharmaceutical ingredient (\"API\") and different phar maceutically inactive ingredients (also known as \"excipients\") having certain functions in the composition, e.g. , stabilization, dissolution, adjustment of pH, filling, etc. 116 See Gitter id. 117 Cf. Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Eli Lilly and Co. , 598 F. 3d 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (essentially abolishing method claims directed to mechanisms of action per se , namely as standalone claims independent from sufficient disclosure of compounds that are used to achieve the de sired action as part of the 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112 \u00b6 1 written description requirement).

Cir. 1995) (holding that an antitumor compound does not necessarily have to be tested in-vivo to fulfill the utility requirement under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 and that in-vitro tests using cell-line models may be sufficient; stating that \"[t]he stage at which an invention in [the field of biologics] becomes useful is well before it is r eady to be administ ered to humans\"); In Infringement 583 F.3d 1317, 1389 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (\"results from animal tests or in vitro experiments may be sufficient to satisfy the utility requirement\"). Notably, this estimated timeframe is confirmed by my findings that the average time period between the filing of the first patent applications pertaining to biological products and their approval by the FDA is about 3728 days, or 10.2 years. See supra note 106. Deducting the estimated 6-9 years of clinical trials and 1-1.33 years of processing of BLAs it appears that the time frame of filing of the first patent applications covering biological products is about 0-3 years prior to the beginning of clinical trials. A possible explanation to this patent filing strategy is that once a compound enters the stage of human trials it is exceedingly difficult to keep it as a trade secret and the early filing is meant to preserve the developer's prospects of monopoly in any product that may result from it s R&D efforts. Another explanation is that early filing of patent applications mitigates pressure from in-house scientists to be allowed to publish their scientifically significant findings in scientific literature. 119 Notably, the first patent application is not necessarily th e first submission to the USPTO, which is frequently of a provisional application containing little more than prelimin ary data and a rudimentary concept of the invention and whose purpose is merely to \"buy\" the inventors another year for further development of their invention. See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 111(b), 119(e). For further discussion of provisional applications see USPTO, Provisional Application for Patent, http://www.uspto.gov/patents/resources/types/provapp.jsp . 120 See 35 U.S.C \u00a7 154. This expiration date may be adjusted to compensate for delays in the processing of the application by the USPTO, a filing of a terminal disclaimer with respect to the issued patent and time lost during the examination and approval of the BLA by the FDA. See infra Part IV.B. 121 For purposes of the discussion herein, a \"primary patent\" is defined as a patent issued from one of the first patent applications to be filed early in the R&D of the biological product and covering, typically, the biological API itself, its manufacturing and/or the first known methods of using it.

However, when comparing the term of statut ory exclusivities to the term of primary patents, it is necessary to take into account patent term extensions that one primary patent per FDA-approved product may receive under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 156.123 If we make the most patent-term- favorable assumptions that virtually all first primar y patents (i.e. the first primary patent to issue for any given biological product) woul d merit an extension of 4-5 years,124 then it is possible to argue that for any biological product there would be one patent whose term would be extended 1.5-2 years beyond the expiration of the 12- 12.5-year market exclusivity period.125 Thus, while generally the first patents covering biological pro ducts would expire within 21-25 years from the 122 This calculation is based on adding the estimated 1-4 years from the onset of development\u2014which is the period during which one could assume most early patents pertaining to a biological product would be filed\u2014to the 20 year patent term. 123 Under term of patents pertinent to biological produ cts \"shall be extended by the time equal to the regulatory review period for the approved product\" up to a total period of 14 years from the date of approval of the biological product but not exceeding 5 years, whereas the \"regulatory review period\" is calculated as half the time in which the product was in clinical trials, plus the period it took the FDA to review and approve the BLA. See id .; see also Mossinghoff, supra note 26, at 190 (reciting and explaining the abovementioned patent term extension provisions and stating that \"[t]he patent term restoration part . . . in title 35 of the United States Code . . . [consists of] very long, very complicated provisions . . . The length of the exclusivity periods are strictly arbitrary legislative numbers pulled out of the air.\"). 124 Given the length of clinical trials of biologics and the average 12-16 months needed for FDA review of BLAs, it is prudent to assume that the majority of biological products would merit the maximum patent term extension of half the clinical trials' period plus the time needed for FDA review of the application up to a maximum of 5 years. Basing the calculation on the estimated times brought herein, the term extension could be roughly estimated as equal to \u00bd of 6-9 years plus 1-1.33 years, namely 4-5.83 years. Given the upper limit of 5 years, a typical patent term extension period would be 4-5 years. 125 Since under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 156 patent term extension cannot extend the patent term beyond 14 years from the date of FDA approval of the product and the statutory market exclusivity under BPCIA extends for 12-12.5 years from that date, then, arguably, no patent term could be extend ed more than 2 years beyond th e expiration of a twelve-year market exclusivity or 1.5 years beyond the e xpiration of a 12.5-year market exclusivity.

T hus, as I will argue in the next section, even with pate nt term extension, primary patents are expected to expire, on average, around 5-11 months subs equent to the expiration of th e 12-12.5-year market exclusivity period under BPCIA.127 B. Patent term vs. Market Exclus ivity for Biologics\u2014A Case Study In order to test the validity of the above timeframe estimates and compare the term of patents pertaining to biological pr oducts with the term of market exclusivity that such products would receive under BPCIA, I calculated (1) the term of the first-to-issue primary patents128 126 This calculation is based on adding the estimated 4-5 ye ars of patent term extension to the 21-25 years patent term from the inception of development. The calculation would be slightly different if we were to add 2 or 1.5 years to the statutory exclusivity period of 23 to 28 years, re sulting in a similar patent term extending 25-29.5 years from the beginning of development. 127 See infra Part IV.B. 128 See Table 1 included as Appendix A, note 248 and accompanying text. The patent term calculation was based on the various sections of patent law and includes any patent term extensions awarded to patents under the Hatch-Waxman Act as listed in the USPTO Listing of Patent Term Extensions under 35 U.S.C. 156, http://www.uspto.gov/patents/resources/terms/156.jsp and any patent term adjustments as reflected on the face of the patents and in the patent information available through th e USPTO Patent Application Information Retrieval System (PAIR), http://portal.uspto.gov/external/portal/pair .

Furthermore, if we add the extension of 6 months to the mark et exclusivity period 129 The list consists of seventy-nine biological products for which primary patents could be identified, including sixteen out of the twenty-four best selling biological products in 2008 and excluding insulin and human growth hormone (hGH) products, for which generic (or \"follow-on\") versions have already been approved by the FDA. See LaMerie Business Intelligence, Top 20 Biologics 2008 , R&D Pipeline News\u2014Special Edition 1/2009, selection criteria for the analyzed sample of seventy-nine biological products might, admittedl y, reflect selection biases. At the same time, it is difficult to determine what would be considered a \"representative sample\" of biological products for the purpose of calculating the average length of primary patent life covering such products. 130 See Appendix A, note 249 and accompanying text. 131 See Appendix A, note 251 and accompanying text. Notably, for purposes of the calculations herein, I refrained from making any assumptions regarding the potential addition of \u00bd year of market exclusivity for experimentation in pediatric populations. See supra note 86 and accompanying text. 132 The calculation of the average number of days between FDA approval and the expiration of the first-to-issue primary patent listed for each of the seventy-nine products is done as explained in note 251, adding the number of days for all seventy-nine products and then dividing by seventy-nine. This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. (making it 12.5 years) for having a product tested and approved for pediatric use,133 the average term of the first identified primary patents pe rtaining to the seventy- nine biological products listed in Table 1 would extend about five months beyond the end of the market exclusivity period in these products. In conclusion, patents in the family of the original application134 could be expected to expire roughly within 21-25 years from the onset of the development of the biological product135 with one more patent expected to expire, on average, around 5-11 months after the period of market exclusivity under BPCIA. Thus, arguably, based on the above calculations, the market exclusivity period under BPCIA would keep competiti on out of biologic markets, on average, for 5-11 months less than the average monopoly pe riod afforded by primar y patents on inventions pertaining to the biological product .136 These conclusions may be illustrated graphically as follows: 133 See supra notes 86-87 and accompanying text. 134 A \"patent family\" includes all divisional, continuation and continuation-in-part applications (and issued patents thereof) stemming from a certain earlier parent application. See USPTO, Manual of Patent Examination and Procedure \u00a7\u00a7 201.04-201.08. 135 See supra note 122 and accompanying text. 136 These conclusions are in accord with the rationale behind the twelve-year market exclusivity period for new biological products under BPCIA, namely, ensuring that original product developers would be able to monopolize their products for a period at least as long as that which their patents would have afforded them. See supra notes 72- 74 and accompanying text. Importantly, these conclusions are only valid with respect to primary patents covering the \"first wave of inventions\" rather than to patents covering inventions resulting from continuing research. This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. These conclusions invite the question: what is the justification (if any) for this mostly overlapping protection of biological pr oducts under both BPCIA and patent law137 and what implications might there be to th is \"double-tiered\" protection? C. Patents vs. Statutory Exclusivities for Biological Products: A Public Policy Perspective Comparing the rationales for gr anting statutory exclusivities with the patent theories discussed earlier, it appears that the reasoning behind both types of monopoly is quite similar if 137 Disagreements regarding the length of patent protection are not uncommon, given the complexity of patent law and the dependence of such calculation on numerous factors (e.g. , timing of filing of patent applications, the ramifications of various different types of extensions, the prosecution of the patents, etc.) However, even slight changes in the term of this patent or another do not ch ange the fact that the effective result of BPCIA is the institution of \"double monopoly protection\" for biologics. This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. not identical, especially in the context of biologics. In a nutshell, the incentive-to-disclose and incentive-to-invent/invest patent theories emphasi ze patents' functional ro le of incentivizing the disclosure of existing inventi ons and the pursuit of further R& D activities leading to more inventions.138 Taking a closer look at th e rationales for granting stat utory exclusivities reveals a highly similar picture. The purpos e of statutory exclusivities in the context of pharmaceuticals is to provide assurance that developers of original biologics are able to reap the fruits of their investment, thereby ensuring the existen ce of sufficient incen tive-to-invent/invest.139 Thus, arguably, both patent and statut ory exclusivities regimes (1) r ecognize developers' right to benefit from the fruit of their labor by creating means to exclude others from using the biologics they developed;140 (2) enable only the developers to reap profits from the biological products for a certain period of time; and (3) encourage and requi re developers of biologi cs to disclose to the public the products they develop and their uses as a pre-requisite to the developers' ability to receive exclusivity in their products.141 Accordingly, at least from a functional perspective, in 138 See supra Part II.A. 139 See Kelleher , supra note 57 , at 255 (\"[the New Chemical Entity five year market exclusivity provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act] was meant to alleviate concerns that a generic pathway would prohibit innovators from realizing the benefits of their investments\"); Wing Yan Tam, supra note 46, at 553 (\"[t]he policy behind marketing exclusivities is to incentivize pharmaceuti cal research entities to engage in ambitious, cutting-edge research for the development of new drugs and to develop greater understanding about existing drugs.\"); see also Grabowski 2009, supra note 5, at 2 (recognizing that both patents and statutory exclusivities \"address the need for innovators to have some period of returns before imitators can enter the market with an abbreviated filing\"). 140 In the case of patents, these means to exclude take the form of letters of patent enforceable by courts while in the case of statutory exclusivities they entail direct exclusion of potential competitors from the market for the particular biological product. 141 In the context of patents, disclosure takes place as part of patents' specifi cations. In the context of statutory exclusivities, disclosure occurs in the submission of some publicly available information as part of the BLA. Thus, the incentive-to-disclose rationale is inherent to the context of biologics for the reason that it is impossible to commercialize a biologic without prior approval by the FDA, which can only be granted subsequent to the This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. the context of biologics, both patents and statut ory exclusivities seek to achieve the same purpose and incentivize essentially the same behavior by inventors, investors and developers. Accordingly, the goal of technological adva ncement in the area of biological products could be served by affording any kind of effectiv e exclusivity guaranteei ng sufficient profits to investors in R&D regardless of whether the product of such R&D would eventually fit in the strict mold of a \"patentabl e invention\" under patent law.142 1. Why Patents May Not Provide Sufficien t Protection to the Interests of Developers of Biological Products (and Therefore Would Fall Short as Means of Incentivizing the Develo pments of Biological Products) The similarity of purpose and effect of statut ory exclusivities and pa tent protection begs the question: why, if at all, is th ere a need for statutory exclusivit ies in addition to patents? The justification that is most frequently offered for making statutory excl usivities in biological products available in addition to patents is th e insufficiency of patents alone for protecting proprietary interests in biological products.143 Viewed in this light, in the context of biologics submission of information regarding the product, including such publicly available information about the nature of the product and its intended medical uses. In other words, the incentive to disclose information to the public about biologics exists regardless of any additional exclusivity that may or may not be granted to the products' developers under patent law. Interesting questions remain, however, as to the extent of disclosure incentivized by patent and statutory exclusivities regimes with respect to manufacturing \"know-how\" and actual clinical data. For further discussion of these issues see infra Part IV.C.2(b) and note 160 \u00b62 and accompanying text. 142 As early as the 1950s, Machlup already recognized that it is \"monopoly grant\" in general, rather than patent monopoly in particular, that is necessa ry to incentivize the risks taken by fi nanciers of industrial application of certain technology. See Machlup, supra note 11, at 36-37 (\"[t]he risks involved [in investment in technological R&D] may be too great to be undertaken except under the sh elter of a monopoly grant\"). According to this logic, statutory exclusivities would be no different than patents from the incentive-to-invest point of view. 143 See infra Parts IV.C.1(a)-IV.C.1(d). Representatives of original biologics developers have made forceful assertions regarding the need for both statutory exclusivities and patent protection in biological products. See e.g. BIO White Paper, supra note 2, at 22 and 37 (arguing that \"[a]s was the case in the Hatch-Waxman Act, it will be important to consider patent exclusivity, along with market exclusivity provided through the regulatory approval mechanism, as an integral part of the follow-on biologic approval framework\" and that \"any statutory pathway for This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review.

(a) Acquiring Patents and Enforcing them Cost a Lot, Yet Patents Provide a Limited Degree of Le gal Protection to Biologics The patent system suffers from inherent sh ortcomings that make the investment in obtaining and enforcing patents a risky and highly uncertain prospect. The securing and enforcement of patent right s involve a long and tedious via dolorosa of intricate (and expensive) proceedings. They require compliance with co mplicated legal criteria such as \"novelty,\" \"usefulness\" and \"non-obviousness\" as well as a plethora of pro cedural and technical requirements stemming from centuries of litigation and patent prosecution.145 This complexity, the approval of follow-on biologics must contain an appropriate mix of patent-based and market/data-based exclusivity to ensure effective market protection to incentivize investment and innovation\"). 144 According to Grabowski and DiMasi, the purpose of stat utory exclusivities is to provide investors \"with an 'insurance policy' against the potential failings of patent protection for biologics.\" See Grabowski et al., supra note 5, at 4; Grabowski & DiMasi 2009, supra note 5, at 8 (\"[f]rom the standpoint of innovative firms, [statutory] exclusivity protection provides a back-up or insurance polic y to the patent system\"); BIO Data Exclusivity Position Paper, supra note 5, at 4 (\"a 14-year period of data exclusivity serves essentially as an insurance policy that provides the innovator with some certainty of protection\"). 145 See Machlup, supra note 11, at 6 (\"but just what an 'invention' is, and when it can be regarded as 'novel' and 'useful,' is not self evident. The questions of the 'c orrect' criteria of utility, novelty, and invention have been answered in many different ways, and the courts of several countries are constantly recons idering earlier answers\"). For a good exemplification of the intricacy of patent prosec ution proceedings one need on ly consider the volume of the USPTO's Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP). See MPEP, 8th ed. (2001), available at http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/mpep.htm . This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. when combined with the high rate of patent invalidation in litigation,146 creates uncertainty regarding the outcome of patent litigation a nd undermines the ability of developers and entrepreneurs to rely on patents as reli able means of securing their investment.147 M a c h l u p described the shortcomings of patents as follows: The patent system lacks logic. It post ulates something called 'invention' but in fact no satisfactory definition of \"invention\" has even appeared, and the courts, in their search for guiding rules, have produced an almost incredible tangle of conflicting doctrines. This confusion has led to extensive and costly litigation. Its critics have described the patent right as merely \"something which has to be defended in the courts\" and, because it may put the individual inventor at a disadvantage against the larger corporations , as \"a lottery in which it is hardly worthwhile taking out a ticket.\" The syst em, too, is wasteful. It gives protection for 16 years (or thereabouts) wh ilst in fact over nine-t enths of the patents do not remain active for the whol e of this period . . . It is almost impossible to conceive of any existing social institut ion so faulty in so many ways. It survives only because there seems to be nothing better. 148 All of these shortcomings of the patent syst em appear to be further exacerbated in the context of pharmaceuticals in gene ral and biologics in particular. 149 First, as I will later argue, 146 See Michael Meehan, Increasing Certainty and Harnessing Private Information in the U.S. Patent System: A Proposal for Reform , 2010 Stan. Tech. L. Rev. 1, 1 (2010) (\"[n]early half of litigated patents are invalidated\"). 147 See Grabowski 2008, supra note 5, at 482 (warning that \"if the relatively few large success[ful biological products that make it through development and approval] experience increased uncertainty due to patent challenges and the potential for early entry of generic versions, higher risk-adjusted rates of return will be demanded by venture capital firms as well as in initial public offerings and s econdary offerings in public markets, yielding fewer candidates that meet this standard.\"); Grabowski & DiMasi 2009, supra note 5, at 9 (\"[u]ncertainty about recoupment periods and the ability to earn a risk adjusted return on particular new product candidates will result in fewer of these candidates being taken forward into development.\"). 148 Machlup, supra note 11, at 44. Despite the fact that Machlup ma de these statements over 50 years ago - before the patent term was adjusted to 20 y ears from the date of filing and prior to the creation of the Federal Circuit - it appears that much of what Machlup described in 1958 remains true today in the context of biologics. 149 See Grabowski 2009, supra note 5, at 2 (\"[p]atents may provide less clear and less predictable intellectual property protection for biologics than for small molecule drugs\") and 4 (\"there is a much higher probability now than there was a decade ago that drugs will experience pate nt challenges and that they will occur much sooner after brand launch.\").

Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. due to some particular characteristics, biologic s are subject to especial ly high barriers to patentability not existing in other areas of technology.150 Second, the patent dispute resolution framew ork established by BPCIA would necessitate an even higher investment of reso urces by all of the parties involved.151 As discussed earlier, BPCIA sets up a highly complicated and elabor ate framework for the resolution of patent disputes arising out of the filing of an application for biosimilar products.152 This fram ework would require potential a dversaries to obtain extensive legal counseling153 and, possibly, litigate numerous patent disputes in several different legal proceedi ngs over a prolonged period of time.154 Furthermore, protecting a single biolog ical product normally involves more than one patent so it is prudent to assume that patent disputes arising in the context of biologics would not 150 See infra Part IV.C.1(b); See also BIO Data Exclusivity Position Paper, supra note 5, at 2-3 (arguing that patent law yields increasingly narrow patent claims to biologics). 151 See Laura A. Coruzzi, Jonathan A. Muenkel & Lynda Q. Nguyen, The Crusade for Follow-On Biologics: The Next Wave of Pharmaceutical Patent Litigation? , 2 No. 1 LANDSL 30, 31 (2009) (predicting that the passage of a framework for the approval of generic versions for biological products may \"result in an influx of patent litigation in the field of biology\"). 152 See supra notes 93-104 and accompanying text. 153 BPCIA dictates that the parties involved in the patent dispute partake in an exchange of patent lists and statements of their respective legal positions, to be followed by negotiations aimed at the resolution of possible patent disputes prior to and in lieu of resorting to any legal action in court. See BPCIA \u00a7 7002(a) (codified these proceedings' robustne ss, the necessary involvement of attorneys in these proceedings is unlikely to co me at an insubstantial cost. 154 The framework set up in BPCIA acc ounts for the possibility that patent disputes under BPCIA may involve several different legal proceedings spanning over the course of 8 years or more, beginning with the expiration of the data exclusivity period\u2014four years after the approval of the original product\u2014and ending with the conclusion of actions for declaratory judgment and/or injunction prompted by an advance notice of intent to market a biosimilar product given 180 days prior to the onset of marketing. See BPCIA \u00a7 7002(a) and 262(l)(9)). Notably, the existence of patents covering the biological product would automatically trigger the BPCIA patent dispute resolu tion proceedings even if the patents are set to expire prior to the end of the market exclusivity period.

Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. only entail several legal proceedings over a prol onged period of time, but would also involve several patents directed at di fferent types of inventions.155 Finally, the scope afforded to patents pertai ning to biologics by courts is even more unpredictable than that of patent s in general due to the uncertain ty surrounding the application of the doctrine of equivalents to this relatively new area of technology.156 Combining all of the above with the already increased likelihood of patent challeng es characterizing the area of pharmaceuticals in recent years,157 the prospect of utilizing patents to protect proprietary 155 See Grabowski 2009, supra note 5, at 2-3 (\"[b]iologics rely on mu ltiple patents, including narrower product patents and process patents\"); supra notes 113-116 and accompanying text. More patents represents a larger investment in prosecution and enforcement as well as in creased uncertainty regarding the scope of the protected rights and the degree and extent of their enforceability. 156 The doctrine of equivalents is a patent law construct meant to encompass within th e scope of patent claims subject matter which does not squarely fall under the literal m eaning of the claim but is nonetheless equivalent to the patented invention. The most common legal standard for equivalence is the \"function-way-result\" test according to which a product or process is deemed an equivalent where \"the accused product or process performs substantially the same function, in substantially the sa me way, to achieve substantially the same result, as disclosed in the claim.\" See Abbott Laboratories & Astellas Phar ma, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc. et al. , 566 F.3d 1282, 1296-1297 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (\"[e]quivalency may also be proven where the differences between the invention as claimed and the accused product or process are insubstantial.\"). Thus, for example, even if a generic biological API would not literally infringe the relevant compound claim, it could trigger an issue of equivalents if the two compounds would have substantially the same structure enabling them to achieve substantially the sa me result in substantially the same way or are otherwise only different in an insubstantial way. According to the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO), \"[b]iotechnology is considered an u npredictable field because it is often no t known how even a minor change may affect the structure, behavior and biological activity of a protein.\" See BIO White Paper, supra note 2, at 28. Thus, if even a seemingly minor change to a biological compound may drastically affect its structure, the way it functions and/or its biological result, then it is possible to say that such minor changes in a biological compound would affect the \"function-way-result\" aspect s of such compound in a \"not insubstantial way,\" which, in turn, would render the scope of equivalents in such a compound highly unpredictabl e. Accordingly, as recogni zed in the BIO White Paper, \"there is no certainty that an innovator can obtain adequate patent protection covering variant proteins.\" See BIO White Paper, supra note 2, at 28. See also Aljalian, supra note 168 at 55-57 and 66-72 (arguing that \"[t]he application of the doctrine of equivalents in the realm of ge ne and protein patents, which appear to be the foundation of new medical breakthroughs, is highly significant . . . Thus there is debate over its applicability\" and calling for limiting the applicability of the doctrine of equivalents in such patents). 157 See Grabowski & DiMasi 2009, supra note 5, at 19 (\"the tren d in recent years has been for patent challenges to become much more frequent\").

Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. interests of developers of biological products app ears to be far from a ttractive, which may, in turn, result in a curbing of R&D.158 Interestingly, these shortcomings of the pa tent system are \"complemented\" with claims that, at least in the context of bi ologics, patents do not serve their ro le as facilitators of disclosure of valuable information to the public.159 Biotechnology patents have been accused of not providing sufficient disclosure to benefit the public and of revealing only piecemeal portions of certain technologies, which are useless in and of themselves and which could only serve as part of larger mechanisms to which the public is not made privy.160 158 See 2008 CRS Report, supra note 1, at 24 (\"several experts maintain that defending patents may divert support from on-going innovation, especially in small companies th at make up a significant portion of the biotechnology sector). 159 See supra Part II.A.1. 160 See e.g. Sorscher, supra note 58, at 305 (\"the patent for [biologics] may only cover early versions of the product produced in the laboratory setting, not the master cell lines and scaled-up industrial process used to produce the product eventually tested on patients and approved by the FDA. Firms can and do seek trade secret protection on these cell lines and processes, forcin g follow-on manufacturers to start over after a long an expensive design process.\"). Arguably, the statutory exclusivities established under BPCIA would not do a better job at facilitating disclosure of meaningful/practical information to the pu blic since the actual clinical data and manufacturing know- how submitted as part of the original BLA is considered proprietary and therefore not accessible to the public. See generally Letter from Prof. John C. Yoo to the Food and Drug Administration, Division of Dockets Management (Oct. 21, 2004), available at http://www.gphaonline.com/ sites/default/files/UC- Berkeley%20Professor%20Yoo's%20Analysis%20of%20the%20Takings%20Clause.pdf (addressing the constitutionality of the FDA's reliance on safety and efficacy conclusions reached in approval proceedings of original biological products for the approval of generic versions of such products and determining that it is not a taking of such (admittedly) proprietary information under the Fifth Amendment). Cf. generally Dinh, supra note 3, at 102-103 (arguing that drug developers have no property interest in the public fact that a certain drug was found to be safe and efficacious enough to be approved for marke ting and because such reliance does not involve an actual disclosure of clinical data submitted by drug developers); Andrew Wasson, Taking Biologics for Granted?

Rev. 4, 30 (2005) (arguing that \"it is unlikely that the approval of off-patent biologics originally approved under the [F]FDCA would be a taking\"); John C. Yoo, Takings Issues in the Approval of Generic Biologics , 60 Food & Drug L.J. 33, 43 (2005) (\"[i]f FDA decided to use the knowledge acquired by a pioneer company in furtherance of a subsequent approval of a generic biologic drug, the agency likely would encounter no significant taking issue.\"). Some commentators have argued that the FDA should make full disclosure to the public of safety and efficacy data relied on as part of approval proceedings This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. FDA-granted statutory exclusivities, on th e other hand, are obtained and enforced automatically, as a by-product of the FDA approval proceedings,161 and their practice does not require their beneficiary to take any specific action.162 They also do not lend themselves to the skirmishes that characterize pa tent infringement disputes.163 Thus, statutory exclusivities negate the need for long, cumbersome, expensive a nd uncertain proceedings such as those characterizing patent prosecution and enforcemen t, which makes statutory exclusivities highly appealing as means of protecting one's investment in technology.164 Rather, statutory of new pharmaceuticals. See e.g. Galbraith, supra note 205, at 712, 752-54, 762-767 (2009) (making a compelling argument in favor of \"comprehensive disclosure of meanin gful clinical trial data from all studies, regardless of whether FDA approval is obtained or even sought\"); see also See Ruckelshuus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1005-1009 (1984) (\"the Trade Secrets Act cannot be construe d as any sort of assurance against internal agency use of submitted data during consideration of the application of a subsequent applicant for registration.\"). 161 As discussed earlier, statutory exclusivities are conf erred \"automatically\" on recipients of FDA marketing approvals and thus, securing them requires no direct additional investment on the part of developers of biologics. Putting a biologic through all the tests and clinical trials necessary for approval by the FDA is an essential and unavoidable part of its approval for marketing. Therefore, the investment involved in obtaining FDA approval for biological products should be viewed as sunk costs, i.e. as a necessary expe nditure that has to be invested regardless of the legal protection sought for the investment. Hence, the direct investment in obtaining a statutory exclusivity could be viewed as $0 while obtaining and securing patents in related inventions would presumably involve additional costs. Similarly, the enforcement of patents woul d require the developers of original biologics to invest significant amounts in bringing lawsuits against infringers. As for statutory exclusivities, if anything, it would be the FDA that would bear the costs of litigating possible challenges of its decisions not to approve additional products for the treatment of a particular condition or havi ng a certain chemical structur e and not the developers of the original products. 162 Under BPCIA, potential competitors would be barred from even attempting to enter the market while the statutory exclusivities are in place beca use the FDA would be unable to accept for evaluation any application for a follow-on biological product prior to the expiration of the data exclusivity period or approve such applications prior to the expiration of the market exclusivity period. See supra notes 84-85 and accompanying text. 163 As discussed earlier, statutory exclusivities are signific antly less vulnerable to legal challenges than patents. See supra Part II.B. See also Brill, supra note 5, at 6 (\"[p]atents can, and frequen tly are, subject to legal challenge and therefore contain some amount of uncertainty for the patent holder. Data exclusivity is not challengeable in court and therefore is not uncertain.\"). 164 See Brill id. at 6. The application of statutory exclusivities would not be affected by the inherent uncertainty accompanying patent law, especially with regard to such ma tters as the application of th e doctrine of equivalents, meeting of burdens of proof, \"battles of experts,\" inequitable conduct and more. This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. exclusivities provide a relatively predictable outcome in case of potential disputes, which, in turn, represents not only significant cost savings but also minimization of investors' risks, thereby creating a business environmen t favorable to investment in R&D.165 (b) The 'Product of Nature' Doctrine and the Insufficiency of Patents as Means of Promoting Basic Research and Development in Biology and Biomedicine There are various types of biologics for whic h patentability is limited and yet for which R&D is highly desirable from a public policy perspective. 166 In many of these instances, the impediment to patentability is the 'product of nature' doctrine accordin g to which patents may only be granted for \"nonnaturally occurring [art icles of] manufacture or composition[s] of matter\" that are \"product[s] of human ingenuity.\"167 In other cases, the obstacles may be the heightened standards of written descrip tion and enablement,168 best mode169 and utility170 and 165 In this respect, the legal certainty accompanying a regime of statutor y exclusivities has a clear advantage over patents from an incentive-to-invent/invest public policy perspective. 166 E.g. genes, naturally occurring nucleic acid sequences (DNA and RNA) which have not been fully sequenced, non-purified naturally occurring compositions containing antibodies, naturally occurring proteins and hormones and so forth. See Kelleher, supra note 57, at 256 (\"the patentability of some biological materials is extremely narrow due to stringent specification an d enablement requirements\"). 167 See Diamond v. Chakrabarty , 447 U.S. 303, 309-310 (1980). According to the Chakrabarty Court The laws of nature [and] physical phenomena . . . have been held not patentable. . . Thus, a new mineral discovered in the earth or a new plant found in the wild is not patentable subject matter. . . Such discoveries are \"manifestations of . . . natu re, free to all men and reserved exclusively to none.\" Id. at 309 [internal citations omitted]. The 'product of nature' doctrine bears particular relevance to the context of biologics because so many biological products are in fact naturally occurring molecules, e.g. human growth hormone, insulin, erythropoietin, etc. See 2008 CRS Report, supra note 1, at 3 n. 19, 13 (addressing the implications of the 'product of nature' doctrine on biologics). 168 See Argoudelis , 434 F.2d 1390, 1392 (CCPA 1970) (requiring making a deposit of microorganisms to a publicly available depository as part of meeting the written description and enablement requirements under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, first paragraph); Fiers v. 1164, 1170 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (\"[a]n adequate written This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review.

Aljalian, The Role of Patent Scope in Biopharmaceutical Patents , 11 B.U. J. Sci. & Tech.

See also generally Karen G. Potter, Getting Written Description Right in the Biotechnology Arts: A Realist Approach to Patent Scope , 28 Biotechnology L. Rep. 1, 17 (2009) (describing the uncertainty surrounding the law of written description in biotechnological patents). 169 See e.g. Gregory N. Mandel, The Generic Biologics Debate: Industry's Unintended Admission That Biotech Patents Fail Enablement , 11 Va. J.L. & Tech 8, 66-77 (2006) (arguing that patents directed to biological products are generally not enabled as they do not provide sufficient detail to enable practicing the inventions in terms of manufacturing know-how). 170 See John R. Thomas, CRS Report for Congress: An Examination of the Issues Surrounding Biotechnology Patenting and Its Effect Upon Entrepreneurial Companies, at 18-26 (2000) [hereinafter 2000 CRS Report] (addressing the application of th e utility requirement under 35 U.S. C. \u00a7 101 to biotechnologies). 171 See e.g. Amgen v. Chugai, 927 F.2d at 1206 (\"when an inventor is unable to envision the detailed constitution of a gene so as to distinguish it from other materials, as well as a method for obtaining it, conception has not been achieved until reduction to practice has occurred, i. e., until after the gene has been isolated.\"). See also 2000 CRS Report, supra note 170 at 11-18 (addressing potential obstacles to patentability due to what the author describes as \"ethical concerns\"). 172 One such type of research involves the identification of particular genes and naturally occurring mutations in the human genome. Among the most prominent types of genetic diseases whose exact genetic background remains unknown at this time are: asthma, various types of cancer, epilepsy and many more. See National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, What Causes Asthma? , http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/D iseases/Asthma/Asthma_Causes.html (\"[r]esearchers think a combin ation of factors (family genes and certain e nvironmental exposures) interact to cause asthma to develop\"); National Cancer Institute, Cancer Genetics Overvi ew netics/overview/HealthProfessional/page2 (\"[the] expanding knowledge [of cancer genetics] has implications for all aspects of cancer management, including prevention, screening, and treatment\"); National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS Epilepsy Information Page , http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disor ders/epilepsy/epilepsy.htm (\"[r]esearchers are working to identify genes that may influence epilepsy\").

Rather, it facilitates granting statutory exclus ivities independent of external criteria such as \"patentability\" and depends only on the FDA' s finding of biological products as sufficiently safe and effective.175 Thus, the statutory exclusivities regime established by BPCIA would incentivize any kind of R&D project that may ev entually lead to biological products regardless of its patent ability, including research that may lead to the discovery of naturally occurring and/or non-is olated biological compounds.176 173 For example, courts have created an exception for naturally occurring compounds if such compounds are \"purified and isolated.\" See supra note 113. 174 A recent example of an ongoing ambiguity of the patent ability of biologics is the re-heated debate regarding the patentability of naturally occurring DNA sequences (e.g . genes) and obvious variations thereof (e.g. cDNA, diagnostic products thereof, etc.). See Assoc. for Molecular Pathology, et al. v. United States Patent and Trademark Office, et al. , --- F.Supp.2d ----, 2010 WL 1233416 (holding that DNA sequences are unpatentable subject matter even in their purified form b ecause they are not \"marke dly different\" from native DNA and that methods of analyzing DNA strands for certain sequences not tied to a particular apparatus/machine are equally non-patentable subject matter). 175 See discussion infra Part IV.C.1(a)0. 176 A notable exception to the broad applicability of statutory exclusivities and their potential as means of incentivizing R&D in biomedical technology exists in relation to the development of means of diagnosing certain diseases, including by using identified DNA and RNA sequences. For the reasons mentioned above, newly identified genes and diagnostics thereo f are currently held unpatentable. See supra note 174. However, they also seem to not fall under the definition of biologics under PHSA \u00a7 351(i) ( see supra note 2). Nonetheless, genetic diagnostics have an important role in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases and genetic predispositions which could not have otherwise been detected. For example, the tests for the presence of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes associated with increased risk of deve loping breast and ovarian cancers, while not serving as means of preventing such cancers per se , assist in recognizing the need fo r medical surveillance and preventive treatment for individuals having these mutations.

(c) Patents Provide Insufficient Protect ion to Biological APIs and the Processes of Making Them Patent compound claims177 and claims directed to met hods of making them might prove ineffective in protecting pa rticular biological compounds.178 As explained earlier, biological compounds are highly complex molecules and are often made of hundreds, sometimes thousands, of building blocks arranged in intricate three-dimensional structures.179 Thus, biological compounds and the pro cesses of making them normally lend themselves to an enormous number of potential variations, whic h could be used for \"d esigning-around\" patent claim limitations in order to yield highly sim ilar compounds or highly similar processes of making them.180 Cancer Risk and Genetic Testing , http://www.cancer.gov/cancer topics/factsheet/Risk/BRCA . Thus, it is desirable to grant some form of statutory exclusivities\u2014even if shorter than those afforded by BPCIA\u2014in genetic diagnostics so as to incentivize research leading to the development of such diagnostics. 177 Compound claims are patent claims drafted specifically to cover a particular chemical or biological compound or a group of particular compounds defined by structure, function and/or characteristics (e.g. melting point, X-ray diffraction pattern, solubility, density, etc.). 178 See Kelleher , supra note 57, at 256 (\"[t]he complexity of most biologics may allow a biogeneric manufacturer to design around an innovator's patents[ sic], but still secure regulatory approval through its \"biosimilarity\" to the pioneer biologic\"); Grabowski et al., supra note 5, at 4 (\"[p]atent protection alone may be insufficient for biologics in the context of biosimilars\"). 179 See supra note 2. 180 See Gitter, supra note 2, at 612 (explaining that generic versions of biologics \"might be sufficiently similar to the innovator biologic to rely on the FDA's findings of safety and effectiveness for the innovator product, but at the same time prove different enough from the innovator product to avoid a patent infringement claim\"); Jim Hollingshead & Rob Jacoby, Avoiding No Man's Land: Potential Unintended Consequences of Follow-On at 16 (2009), available at http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom- UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/us_lshc_a voiding%20no%20man's%20land_FOB_033009(1).pdf (\"many industry participants are concerned that innovators' patent s will prove relatively easy to circumvent.

Moreover, for the reasons discussed, the doctrine of equivalents would probably not provide effective means for encompassing such \"design-arounds\" within the scope of the relevant claims.181 Given the innumerable possibilities of \"design-arounds\" existing for many biological compounds and the general unpredictability of the results of even minor changes to biological compounds, the application of the doctrine of equivalents to biotechnological inventions might prove extremely difficult.182 E v e n i f w e a s s u m e that the changes to the biological compound do not substantia lly affect the way it achieves a \"substantially same\" result, there would still remain the difficult question: wh at is \"substantial structural similarity\" in biologics for equivalence purposes?

In view of the size of some proteins, it is quite possible that generic manufacturers could develop proteins that would be substantially structurally different from the original biological compound and yet have biological activity identical or highly similar to that of the original compound and therefore fall under the definition of \"biosimilar\" under BPCIA. See also Grabowski 2009, supra note 5, at 2-3 (\"[b]iologics rely on multiple patents, including narrower product patents and process patents that may be more vulnerable to inventing around than small molecule product patents . . . it is possible that biosimilars may be different enough not to infringe on patents, but similar enough to qualify for an abbreviated approval pathway.\"); Potter, supra note 168, at 14-15 (\"[i]in practice, the Courts are reluctant to apply [the doctrine of equivalents] in biotechnology cases . . .

But see FTC Report, supra note 5, at vi (\"there is no evidence that patents claiming a biologic drug product have been designed around more frequently than those claiming small-mo lecule products.\"); Potter, supra note 168, at 1, 14-15 (describing a hypothetical case in which strict written description requirements make a patentee narrowly claim its invention thereby \"inviting\" imitations that do not fall within the scope of the invention as claimed).

Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. biological compound claim under the doctrine of equivale nts (at least at this point in time) is low at best, making it easier for generic manufacturer s to enter the market before developers of original biologics had a chance to reap the profits that would make their efforts worthwhile.183 The statutory exclusivities framework establ ished under BPCIA would not give rise to such potential uncertainties and would eliminat e the need to litigate altogether. The BPCIA statutory exclusivities' framework institutes a clear choice: if one wishes to rely on a previous FDA approval of a certain biological product w ithout having to invest the vast amounts of money necessary in order to obta in approval of her ow n product, she would have to wait until the expiration of the relevant st atutory exclusivity periods.184 Under a statutory exclusivities regime, a generic manufacturer need only seek to obtain a pproval for its product to trigger the statutory exclusivity bar forbidding the FDA from approving its application regardless of whether or not the biological compounds are sim ilar enough to be used interchangeab ly and what their degree of similarity is. (d) Patents Provide Poor Protecti on to Biologics' Manufacturing Know-How 183 The author is not aware of any final court decision finding infringement of a biological compound claim under the doctrine of equivalents.

A possible way of avoiding the waste of resources associated with such situations\u2014at least those resulting from the respective developers' unawareness of the competing project\u2014would be to have the FDA publish preliminary details regarding INDs it receives.

For many biologics, one of the most difficu lt and important aspect s of bringing the product to the market is the deve lopment of manufacturing know-how.185 However, for various reasons, know-how is especially difficult to prot ect under patent law. First, viewed through a patent-law prism, the majority of manufacturing techniques are \"well known in the art.\"186 Thus, the manufacturing recipes of mo st biological products could, ar guably, be developed through 'routine experimentation' and would ther efore be obvious under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103(a).187 Second, as explained earlier, patent cl aims covering manufacturing pr ocesses could, and often are, \"designed-around,\" namely, evaded by making the same products in a different way, thereby rendering them irrelevant to protecting the substa ntial investment involved in the development of manufacturing know-how.188 A grant of statutory exclus ivities under BPCIA, on the other hand, would not require disclosure of manufacturing kno w-how to third parties (e.g. generic manufacturers).189 Similarly, third parties would not be able to circumvent statutor y exclusivities under BPCIA by 185 See BIO White Paper, supra note 2, at 3 (explaining some of the difficulties involved in the manufacturing of biological compounds and their susceptibility to changes in manufacturing processes). 186 I.e. \"well known\" to persons of ordinary skill in the pertinent forms of art, such as molecular biology, biochemistry, etc. 187 See Ritchie v. Vast Resources, 563 F.3d 1334, 1337 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (\"[a]mong the inventions that the law deems obvious are those modest, routine, everyd ay, incremental improvements of an ex isting product or process that confer commercial value . . . but do not involve sufficient inventiven ess to merit patent protection. This class of inventions is well illustrated by efforts at routine experimentation [where] method[s] of creation are well known, making successful results of the experimentation predictable.\"). 188 See Grabowski 2009, supra note 181 and accompanying text; see also BIO White Paper, supra note 2, at 32 (\"[i]t is rare that a patented process of chemical synthesis will be able to block any and all means of producing the product\"). 189 See infra note 160 \u00b62.

Why Concurrent Patent and Statutory Exclus ivities Protection in Biological Products Might Have Undesirable Ramifications In view of the above, it is not surprising that developers of biologi cal products advocated vehemently in favor of long statutory exclus ivity periods for origin al biological products.191 However, even though the litera ture is replete with argument s in favor of making statutory exclusivities available to biological pr oduct developers in addition to patents,192 the author is not aware of similar arguments having been made re garding a supposed need for patent protection in addition to and concurrent with the term of statutory exclusivit ies such as those provided under BPCIA; nor is the author aware of any ju stification for afford ing such protection.193 In other 190 See supra note 184 and accompanying text. 191 See e.g. Grabowski 2009, supra note 5, at 3 (listing the advantages of statutory exclusivities and how they would remedy the shortcomings of patents in the context of biologics). Arguably, the most straightforward way of addressing the inadequacy of the patent system for protecting biotechnological inventions would be to \"fix\" the patent system itself, namely by tailoring specific solutions that would encompass the type of product of biotechnological research and development activities that policy-makers seek to incentivize within the scope of what patent law would deem patentable subject matter. However, this route would not be preferable to statutor y exclusivities because such highly spec ific biotechnology-oriented solutions might increase the transaction costs involved in obtaining and enforcing biotechnology patents, which, as explained above, is an already expensive and highly uncertain prospect. 192 See e.g. references cited supra note 5. 193 As explained earlier, statutory exclusivities would negate the need for patent protection at least for the underlying biological compounds, the methods of making them and the initially appr oved methods of using them. This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. words, no one seems to argue that statutory excl usivities, while they last, provide insufficient protection to the interests of developers of biological products such that they should be supplemented by patent protection. Rather, it app ears that affording protection under both patent and statutory exclusivities regimes while both of them are in effect is likely to have undesirable ramifications. (a) Concurrent Protection by Both Pa tents and Statutory Exclusivities Would Likely Lead to a Wa ste of Societal Resources The enforcement of patents is an expensive prospect not only for the individual parties involved but also for society at la rge. Patent systems require subs tantial investment in education and training necessary to administ er patent prosecu tion and litigation.194 Moreover, maintaining a patent system with all its numerous elements, including a patent office, the various tribunals partaking in the administration and enforcement of patent laws195 and highly trained personnel196 requires a significant ongoing invest ment of societal resources.197 Thus, the investment of resources in the enforcement of patent right s where statutory exclusivities already cover biological products would constitute a waste of the relative portion of societal resources (out of 194 Hypothetically, had these resources not been invested in this manner they could have been invested in other, equally or possibly more socially beneficial avenues. 195 E.g. the Board of Patent Interferen ces and Appeals and federal courts. 196 E.g. judges, administrative judges, patent examiners and all their professional and administrative staff. 197 Notably, the administration of the patent dispute resolution scheme established in BPCIA would require even further investment of societal resources such as those described herein. See further discussion of the BPCIA patent dispute resolution scheme supra Part IV.C.1(a). This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. the entire societal investment in maintaining and administering a patent system) which is necessary to facilitate such enforcement.198 (b) Concurrent Protection by Both Pa tents and Statutory Exclusivities Would Give Rise to Unnecessary and Avoidable Risks of Abuse Monopoly\u2014any monopoly\u2014creates an inherent risk of abuse. 199 Thus, affording patent protection for biological products in parallel to FDA-instituted exclusivities would likely increase the risk of occurrence of abuse by develo pers of biological products in a variety of ways and disserve the public in terest that both regimes were created to promote.200 Such abuse might 198 To clarify: the argument here is not that the entire societal investme nt of resources in the creation and maintenance of a patent system constitutes waste, but rather that the relative portion of such an investment which is necessary to support the handling of patent disputes as they pertain to biological products which are being covered by statutory exclusivities under BPCIA would be wasteful. 199 Machlup defines \"abuse\" as a situation where \"the social objectives which [the monopoly] is supposed to serve are not promoted but rather jeopardized by the way it is used . . . when the temporal, functional, or material limits of the monopoly intended by the [monopoly] grant are overstepped and the actually achieved monopolistic control is extended in time, in sc ope or in strength.\" See Machlup, supra note 11, at 10. 200 For example, numerous commentators have expressed concerns regarding patent abuse practices commonly referred to as \"evergreening.\" See e.g. Laurence J. Kotlikoff, Clearing the Way to Low-Cost Biogenerics, Boston Globe, Oct. 26, 20 08, available at http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/ope d/articles/2008/10/26/clearing_the_way_for_low_cost_bi ogenerics/ (warning against granting developers of original biologics 12-14 years of statutory exclusivity alongside with patent protection and arguing that such protection would increase the risk that developers of original biologics would attempt to evergreen their biological products). A ccording to Katlikoff, evergreening is \"mak[ing] relatively minor changes to existing products in order to restart their monopoly protection clocks. These changes include changing the medication strength of pills . . . changing the form of medication (e.g., switching from pill to capsule), modifying the method of delivery (e.g., from injection to inhalation), expanding indications (applying the medicine to additional conditions), pegylation (which has the eff ect of reducing doses per time period via time-release mechanisms), and glycosolation[ sic] (adding sugar molecules to the medication).\" Katlikoff, supra note 5, at 9. See also Brill, supra note 5, at 7 (\"[e]vergreening is a process whereby the holder of the patents for a biologic drug, using incremental changes to its original product, is able to shift the market to a newer product so as to limit a generic competitor's market opportunity\").

First, BPCIA stipulates that applications for the appr oval of biologics that ar e \"supplements\" to an original BLA cannot re-trigger the mark et and data exclusivity provisions.202 Second, BPCIA determines that applications filed by the same manufacturer or its \" licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity\" would not merit data or market exclusivity if the application is merely for a \"modification to the structure of the biological product th at does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency.\"203 Finally, under BPCIA, an application filed by the same manufacturer for a non-structura l change of the biologic and \"t hat results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosag e form, delivery system, delivery device, or strength\" would, similarly, not award the manufacturer with an exclusivity period on top of that already awarded for the or iginal biological product.204 201 See Machlup, supra note 11, at 10-11 (\"[p]atentees may succeed in extending the time period of control [e.g.]. . . through incomplete disclosure, making it impossible for those without special \"know-how\" to use the invention even after expiration of the patent; . . . through the successive pa tenting of strategic improvements of the invention which make the unimproved invention commercially unusable after expiration of the original patent . . . The patentee may succeed in extending the scope and stre ngth of the monopoly be yond that intended by the law\"), 28 (reviewing different arguments made by others that patents have been misused in various ways to inhibit fair and free competition regardless of efficiency) and 31 (quoting Edwa rds's statement that \"[there] are cases in which one enterprise has held control through patents [of an industry] for periods as long as half a century\"). 202 See BPCIA \u00a7 7002(a) U.S.C. \u00a7 262(k)(7)(C)(ii)(II)). Notably, these provisions leave open the possibility of granting new data and/or market exclusivity te rms for approval of applications for biological products submitted by the same manufacturer that entail a structural change to an original biological product and that results This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. Patents, on the other hand, do not seem to have the same ki nd of safeguards against abuse and remain relatively susceptible to evergreening.205 Furthermore, the elaborate patent dispute resolution scheme established in BPCIA might also, conc eivably, give rise to different types of abuse similar to those that have been affected under the Hatch-Waxman Act.206 Thus, protecting biological products under patent law in additi on to the statutory exclusivities framework in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device, or strength. Yet, arguably, such re-triggering of the exclusivity period is justifiable since the manufacturer would have to put the biological product through what essentially would be a new approval process, including full blown clinical trials, and will therefore need to \"re-invest\" in R&D of what may well be viewed a new and different biological product. Notably, the BPCIA anti-ever greening provisions are in accord w ith Prof. Katlikoff's recommendations for such measures. See supra 5 at 9 (proposing to award full monopoly protection only for the discovery and marketing of a new biologic). By not affording additional statutory exclusivity fo r approval of additional indications of the same biological product, the statutory exclusivity scheme created by BPCIA differs from that of the Hatch-Waxman Act in that BPCIA does not incentivize additional clinical resear ch leading to the approval of the same biologic for the treatment of additional medical conditions. See discussion of the Hatch-Waxman Act supra note 29 and accompanying text. In providing such exacting criteria for the grant of statut ory exclusivities for already-approved drugs, BPCIA might actually curb much needed follow-up research of already-approved biological products, especially with relation to indications that require more complicated or elaborate R&D ef forts which, as such, tend to be \"pushed back\" for later approval, once more easily provable medical benefits of the biological product have already landed it a \"right of passag e\" into the market from the FDA. 205 See Christine D. Galbraith, Dying to Know: a Demand for Genuine Public Access to Clinical Trial Results Data , 78 Miss. L.J. 705, 759 (2009) (\"pharmaceu tical companies have recently employed a wide variety of \"evergreening\" strategies to artificially extend the date a medication officially goes off patent\"). A comprehensive review of the numerous possible \"methods\" of patent abuse and \"evergreening techniques\" in the context of biologics is beyond the scope of this article. Yet, for illustrative purposes it is worth mentioning a prominent example, namely when developers of original pharmaceutical products obtain pa tents on new methods of us ing an original biological product in combination with other ph armaceuticals, whereas the latter are e numerated in the patient prescribing information (PPI) for the or iginal pharmaceutical product s and then asserting inducement of infringement claims against generic manufacturers using the same PPIs (in accordance with FDA requirements) with their generic versions of such products. 206 See e.g. FTC, Generic Drug Entry Prior to Patent Expiration: An FTC Study (2002) (describing several types of patent abuse \"techniques\" used to keep generic competition off the market); s ee also FTC Report, supra note 5, at viii (\"early start [of . based on the experience under Hatch-Waxman, a pre-approval patent resolution process also is likely to lead to consumer harm . . . [by using] the pre-approval patent regulations to delay generic entry. In addition, generic and branded competitors have entered into \"pay-for-delay\" patent settlements that delay entry, not encourage it.\"). Arguably, similar abuses could occur under the pretext of patent dispute resolution under BPCIA.

Biological Products Should Not Receive Concurrent Protection Under Both Patent Law and th e Statutory Exclusivitie s Afforded under BPCIA The conclusion from the discussion thus far is that concurrent pr otection of biologics under both patent and statutory exclusivities regimes is no t only unnecessary but also undesirable. Rather, it would be preferable that any particular biological product be subject to protection under only either of these regimes, namely, BPCIA instituted statutory exclusivities or patents covering the und erlying inventions pertaining to the biological product. As explained earlier, statutory exclusivitie s have numerous advantages over patents.207 At least in the context of biol ogics, patents are a cumbersome, in efficient and often ineffective way of \"promot[ing] the Progres s of Science and useful Arts.\"208 FDA granted statutory exclusivities, on the other hand, appear to be mo re comprehensive and easily enforceable, would significantly reduce costs involved in litigation, are less prone to abuse and would create legal certainty that is currently missing from the protection of technologica l innovation under patent law. Furthermore, statutory exclusivities guara ntee that only \"wor thy technologies\" are granted monopolies. A constant concern in th e context of technological advances is that monopoly grants may be squandered on \"unwort hy\" technologies. For instance, it is not 207 See infra Part IV.C.1. 208 U.S. Const. Art. I \u00a7 8 Cl. 8. This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. uncommon that inventions that la ck any value to society are gran ted patents just because they happen to \"satisfy\" the re quirements of patent law.209 As opposed to the patent examination process, which mostly utilizes standards not di rectly relevant to a ny particular technology, evaluation of new technologies by specialized ag encies directly gauges the \"social worth\" of such technologies. The FDA's expertise and understanding in the ar ea of biologics enables it to evaluate the potential medical benefits of biologics and weig h them against possible risks, thereby directly determining the true societal va lue of specific biological products.210 On the other hand, the patent system utilizes an array of \"surrogat e\" or \"proxy\"\u2014arguably irrelevant\u2014standards to indirectly appraise the societal value of advancemen ts, including biological products.211 Thus, at least in the context of biologics, a statutory exclusivities re gime has an economic advantage over a patent regime as it is more likely to guarant ee that monopolies are only awarded for \"socially valuable\" technologies. 4. A Proposed Amendment to Limit Patent Protection Where BPCIA Statutory Exclusivities are in Force 209 Examples of what may be described as ridiculous patents covering socially worthless technologies are never in shortage. See e.g. http://totallyabsurd.com/ . 210 Direct examination by the FDA presumably guarantees that pharmaceuticals only recei ve monopoly via statutory exclusivities based on the criterion of whether they carry sufficient benefit to the public health per se rather than based on surrogate criteria for measurin g their social worth, which may or may not guarantee that they actually convey any benefit to the public. 211 E.g. novelty, nonobviousness, written description, enablement, and more . See 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq. The FDA evaluation is directed at the crux of the issue of benefit for the public, namely, whether the biological product is safe and efficacious enough to be approved as a medicine and therefore merits statutory exclusivity, regardless of whether or not a hypothetical person of ordinary skill in the art would have found it obvious or in compliance with other seemingly irrelevant criteria enumerated in patent law. This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. As discussed above, in the area of biologics, a statutory exclusivities regime is preferable to a patent regime. To avoid the negative ra mifications of concurrent protection by both statutory exclusivities and patents, it is advisable that upon the ons et of the statutory exclusivity period under BPCIA, developers of the approved products would no longer be able to enforce their patents as they pertai n to the biological product as approved against generic manufacturers applying for the approval of generic versi ons of such products (\"proposed amendment\").212 212 One way of achieving this result would be to amend Title 35 of the U.S. Code to limit section 271 so that it would create causes of action against generic applicants under BPCIA only if no statutory exclusivity under BPCIA is in effect with relation to the product covered by the patent whose enforcement is sought. A possible \"softer\" version of such a sweeping prohibition of enforcement of pertinent patents is to have developers of biological products elect how to protect their proprietary interests in their products, namely by choosing to benefit from the statutory exclusivities scheme afforded under BPCIA or having the ability to enforce their patents covering the underlying technologies in the approved biological product against generic applicants. To implement this \"softer\" version of the proposed amendment, BPCIA could be amended to stipulate that the FDA would refrain from taking the actions related to the approval of generic versions of the biological products as prescribed under BPCIA \u00a7 7002(a) (codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(k)(7)) only pursuant to a commitment by a BLA applicant to be estopped from enforcing its patents pertaining to the approved biological product against such generic applicants and/or so long as developers of biological products do not seek enforcement of their patents covering inventions pertaining to their biological products against parties seek ing approval for generic versions of such product in accordan ce with BPCIA. See supra notes 84-85 and accompanying text. This \"softer\" version may circumvent possible challenges of the proposed amendment as an unconstitutional taking of one's proprietary rights in its patents in violation of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution. Importantly, this amendment is not meant to prevent developers of biological products from enforcing their patents against later applicants seeking approval not under BPCIA. Namely, under no circumstances would developers of biological products be unable to sue for infringement of their patents where a competitor might seek FDA approval of the same biological compound for the treatment of the same medical condition by conducting their own clinical trials, i.e. without relying on the approval of the original biological product under BPCIA. A possible question is why leaving things the way they are, namely \"for the market to take care of,\" would not provide a sufficient and satisfying solution to the pr oblems discussed above arising out of affording double protection to original biological products under both patent and statutory exclusivities regimes. Arguably, if patents are \"so deficient\" as a means of protecting one's proprietary interests in biological products that alternative means - completely outside of patent law - are necessary to in centivize R&D of biologics, then developers of original biological products would be unlikely to seek or pursue enforcement of any patents covering their biological products and the whole issue of double protection would be moot. However, the need for the proposed measure limiting the protection afforded to original biological products is the risk of abuse of patent law (rather than its use for the purposes for which it was intended). In other words, allowing developers of original biological products to benefit, in the broad sense, from both patent and statutory exclusivity regimes might lead to their using the exclusivities under BPCIA for their intended purpose but misusing the protection afforded to their products under patent law in a manner that does not comport with the purpose for which patents were created. The measures This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. Importantly, this proposal would \"strip\" biolog ical products of any additional period of protection under their primary patents subsequent to the expiration of the market exclusivity under BPCIA.213 The potential loss214 of this additional protectio n under patent law (flawed and partial as it may be215) is justified because it reflects payment for insurance embodied in the statutory exclusivitie s afforded under BPCIA .216 In other words, de velopers of original biological products would surrende r about 5-11 months on average of exclusivity under patent law in return for 12-12.5 years of litigation-free and other legal risks'-fr ee market exclusivity (and 4-4.5 years of data exclusivity). Further, making it impossible for developers of original biological products to enforce their primary patents against gene ric applicants filing fo r generic versions of biological products under BPCIA (including after the expiration of the market excl usivity period) would prevent \"double dipping\" by developers of original biological products.217 Arguably, the length of the proposed herein seek to eliminate the risk of such patent abuse by making patent enforcement unavailable in a narrowly defined set of circumstances without derogating from the incentives for R&D of biological products. 213 See supra Part IV.B. 214 Notably, the 5-11 months term of primary patents beyond the expiration of the market exclusivity period under BPCIA is an average number. Thus, while some products would probably be covered by primary patents whose term is more than 5-11 months beyond the market exclusivity period under BPCIA, other products may only be covered by primary patents (if any) whose term is shorter than the market exclusivity period under BPCIA. See infra note 219. 215 See discussion supra Part IV.C.1. 216 See discussion supra notes 92 and 144 and their accompanying texts. 217 To clarify, \"double dipping\" in this context would be the benefit from both patent and statutory exclusivities regimes in the context of approval of generic biologics under BPCIA. This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. market exclusivity peri od granted under BPCIA218 should be sufficient to incentivize R&D in the area of biological pharmaceuticals. There is no justification for \"windf alls\" in the form of additional monopoly periods conferred by primar y patents extending beyond the end of the market exclusivity period in some of the biol ogical products that would further curb public access to these products.219 The proposed amendment is unlikely to discourage continued R&D of approved biological products (which is intended to lead to improvements of approved biological products and, possibly, to the development of new ones).220 This is because the proposed amendment would only apply to patents that cover biological products as originally appr oved by the FDA.221 218 The length of the market exclusivity period of 12-12.5 years under BPCIA is in line with the proposals raised by original biologics industry advocates as necessary for the industry to maintain proper incentives for R&D. See supra notes 72-73 and accompanying text. 219 E.g. of the seventy-nine products listed in Table 1, the term of the primary patents covering 53 of them would extend beyond the end of the twelve-year market exclusivity while the term of the primary patents covering 26 of them would not (the ratio shifts to 49 to 30 for a market exclusivity period of 12.5 years). Importantly, primary patents covering biological products (which would, under the proposal herein, be unenforceable against generic manufactur ers seeking approval of their pro ducts under BPCIA) would still be enforceable against independent developers of the same biological product and third parties who do not seek to utilize the BPCIA framework and who would therefore not be subject to BPCIA's statutory exclusivities provisions. 220 It is common in the context of pharm aceuticals that primary patents applied for early in a product's development process are followed by additional patents claiming (1) par ticular ways of formulating the product, (2) additional methods of manufacturing the API or any of the intermed iate compounds involved in making it and (3) additional methods of using the product or API for treating additional medical conditions [hereinafter \"secondary patents\"]. For example, the biologic Enbrel, which was originally ap proved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, later proved effective in the treatment of other autoimmune di seases such as psoriasis an d Crohn's disease and Avastin, which was originally approved for treatment of colorectal cancer, was later approved for treating non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. See Grabowski & DiMasi 2009, supra note 5, at 4-5 (arguing that new indications are an important source of innovative advances in biologics); Grabowski 2009, supra note 5, at 4 (reviewing three drugs approved for one condition which were later approved for other conditions). 221 In the \"softer\" version, BLA holders should be estopped only from enforcing patents covering the original formulation of the approved biologic, the originally approved indications, the original structure of the biological API, etc. This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. To avoid unnecessary legal disput es there may also be merit in explicitly limiting the proposed amendment so that it would only apply to primar y patents and would not prevent enforcement of secondary patents covering inventi ons stemming from continued R&D.222 Such explicit limitation, while potentially opening the door to abundant litigation involving secondary patents (with all of its risks of evergr eening and patent abuse), would a ssist in providing the necessary incentive for continued R&D of already-approved biologics, wh ich is currently missing from BPCIA. An alternative solution to the problem of lack of incentive for continued R&D of already-approved biological products would be to am end 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(k)(7)(C)(ii)(II) so as to allow for an additional short period of market exclusivity for the approval of additional medical indications for already-approved biological products similar to that afforded under the 3-year additional statutory exclusivity period granted under the Hatch-Waxman Act. 223 The proposed amendment could also raise con cerns that the limitations it imposes on patent recourse might contradict undertakings by the United Stat es under patent treaties not to The author is aware that in leaving an opening for additional monopoly periods subsequent to the expiration of the 12-12.5-year statutory exclusivity period in biological products there remains a risk of abuse by evergreening which would likely need to be addressed in litigation. 222 Since there is clear societal interest in encouraging such continued R&D, there is merit in offering additional incentives for such research in the form of either patents or statutory exclusivities. As explained earlier, statutory exclusivities under BPCIA are unavailable for most types of modifications of a previously-approved biological product. See supra notes 202-204 and accompanying text. Yet, patents may still be available\u2014limited and insufficient as they might be\u2014as a means of incentivizing invention, investment in R&D and disclosure of technology in the contex t of pharmaceuticals. See supra Parts IV.C.1(a), IV.C.1(b) and IV.C.1(d). By limiting the proposed amendments to primary patents, it would be possible to preserve patents as means of encouraging further R&D of already-approved biological products. 223 See supra notes 29 and 204 and accompanying text. This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. deny patent protection to classe s of technologies as such.224 However, arguably, the proposed amendment would not deny protection but rather create a quid pro quo arrangement wherein in order to benefit from statutor y exclusivities under BPCIA, de velopers of biological products would only be limited in enforcement of their ( undeniable) patent rights under a narrow set of circumstances.225 Finally, the proposed amendment would not seem to be at odds with Ar ticle I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the Constitution226 as the Constitutional language does not grant a positive right to obtain patents as such. Rather, Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 authorizes Congress to devise means of promoting the progress of science and usef ul arts as it sees fit, which is exactly what BPCIA does and would continue to do with the proposed amendment.227 Furthermore, if the 224 For example, the North American Fr ee Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Tr ade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights of the World Trade Organization (TRIPS) both stipulate th at \"each Party shall make patents available for any inventions, whether products or processes, in all fields of technology.\" See North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Dec. 17, 1992, art. 1709(1), 32 I.L.M. 605; The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Uruguay Round Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights Including Trade in Counterfeit Goods (\"TRIPS\"), Apr. 15, 1994, art. 27(1), 1994 WL 1711191 (Trty.). See also 2000 CRS Report at 26-27 (\"[t]he potential for limiting the patentability of livin g inventions is moderated by several factors. One source of restraints consists of international agreements to which the United States is a signatory.\"). 225 Notably, this challenge, too, could be overcome by adopting the \"softer\" version of the proposed amendment under which it would be developers of biological products who would have the option to pursue their rights under patent law or benefit from the statutory exclusivities scheme under BPCIA. 226 See U.S. Const. Art. I \u00a7 8 Cl. 8 ([The Congress shall have Power t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to . . . Inventors the exclusive Right to their . . . Discoveries\"). See id. 227 Once again, the \"softer\" version of the proposed amendment could resolve any constitutional difficulty that may arise in this regard under more conserva tive constitutional construction. Namely, ev en if one is to construe Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the Constitution narrowly as only granting Congress the ability to \"secure[] Rights\" (rather than deny such rights), under the proposed amendments inventors would choose to benefit from statutory exclusivities by electing to refrain from enforcing their patents. In other words, it will not be Congress that would deny the inventors' ability to \"secur[e] . . . exclusive [r]ights,\" but rather the inventors themselves who will be making the choice to li mit their own already \"secure[d] . . . exclusive [patent r]ights\" in exchange for the ability to benefit from the statutory exclusivities afforded under BPCIA.

Why Patents Still Have a Role to Pl ay in Incentivizing R&D in Biologics The above conclusions and propos ed amendment raise the follow ing question: if statutory exclusivities are so clearly preferable to patent s in the context of biological products and if patents are not only deficient bu t possibly even harmful to the interests of developers of biological products and public inte rest alike, wouldn't it simply be better to forego patent protection in biological products altogether? The answer to this question is in the negativ e. Despite their numerous shortcomings and the clear advantages statutory exclusivities have over them, patents still ha ve important functions to fulfill in incentivizing the development of biological products during the period prior to the approval of biological products by the FDA . Patents serve an importa nt fundraising tool, which enables R&D entities to rais e the funds necessary to s upport their research projects.229 In this respect patents have a vital f unction in the development of pharmaceutical products and, even 228 Such arguments could rely on the various ways in which patents could be abused and misused in an anti- competitive manner. See supra Part IV.C.2(b). Notably, a constitutional analysis of Congress's power to create the statutory exclusivity scheme under BPCIA appears to merit fu rther analysis, which exceeds the scope of this Article. 229 Although patents may not provide any additional monopoly period to that afforded by the statutory exclusivities under BPCIA or directly attest to the prospects of success of an R&D project that may lead to a biological product, patents carry substantial we ight with investors.

Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. more so, of biological produc ts\u2014given their high R&D costs\u2014 as they make it possible for developers of such products to raise the funds necessary to traverse the various, numerous expensive steps of clinical development prior to being eligible to bene fit from the statutory exclusivities under BPCIA (subsequent to approval of the biological product by the FDA). A possible explanation of the \"sway\" pate nts may have in convincing investors to commit funds to certain R&D projects is their ab ility to prevent situa tions of a \"race to register.\"230 In this respect, patents serve not only as a signaling device between companies but also as means of blocking one's competitors from en tering into such a \"race to register\" in the first place. This explanation appears to be es pecially valid in the c ontext of the biologics industry which consists of a significant portion of small to medium R&D firms. In \"race to register\" situations, patents woul d improve the survivability of su ch small to medium R&D firms competing against major pharmaceutical corpor ations during the development stages of biological products prior to their approval by the FDA.231 Thus, patents would make it possible for small to medium R&D outfits to stay in the market to see another day (and, perhaps, another research project).232 Accordingly, during the period prior to ap proval of biological pr oducts by the FDA and the onset of statutory exclusiv ities under BPCIA, patents woul d actually serve as \"insurance 230 A \"race to register\" occurs when two companies undertake a similar research project and are competing to have their respective products approved by the FDA first. 231 Since large corporations usually have more resources, it is expected that with everything else being equal, they will almost always \"win\" in \"r ace-to-register\" situations. 232 Alternatively, early patent applications and patents is sued from them would make it possible for small-medium R&D firms to get, at the very least, through the initial pr oof-of-concept or pre-clinical testing stages that would enable them to sell their research proj ect to major pharmaceutical corporations.

In addition, as discussed earlier, follow-on patents would also have an important role to play subsequent to the e xpiration of statutory excl usivity periods under BPCIA.233 T o summarize: there is merit in affording biological products sequential (rather than concurrent) protection from (1) any primary patents pertaining to the underlying technology in such products prior to the onset of statutory exclusivities under BPCIA, (2) stat utory exclusivities in the FDA approved products themselves and (3) any secondary patents pertaining to substantial234 further developments of the originally approved biological product. V. Statutory Exclusivities in Bi ological Products\u2014A Peculiar Case or the Future of Incentivizing Innovation In view of the foregoing conclusions one ca nnot help but wonder: is the regulation of generic biologics a harbinger of a new type of intell ectual property regime wherein patents and statutory-exclusivity work in tandem to incentivize R&D? Can we expect to see similar regimes put in place with respect to other areas of technology? And are there areas of technology in which it would be desirable to replace the traditional patent regime with a new regime of statutory exclusivities altogether? As the patter n of technical advance va ries significantly from field to field and from one industry to another, 235 statutory exclusivity frameworks would not 233 See supra notes 220-223 and accompanying text. 234 Notably, the inclusion of the \"substantiality\" language is meant to clarify that sequential protection of insubstantial developments of the biological product\u2014wh ich are essentially evergreening\u2014are not within the scope of legitimate sequential patent protection described herein. 235 See Robert P. Merges & Richard R. Nelson , On the Complex Economics of Patent Scope , 90 Colum. L. Rev. 839, 880 (1990). This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review.

Ho wever, it is quite possible that because of their lower trans action costs and the legal certainty they provide statutory exclusivities could complement patents in so me areas of technology an d possibly even obviate patents altogether in others. It would thus be beneficial to make some observations regarding the characteristics of areas of technology that may be \"candidates\" for such a change in technology- protection regime.236 Yet, before making any such observations, it is worth highlighting two \"pre-requisites\" for the administration of statutory exclusivitie s' regimes. First, to be a \"candidate\" for implementation of a statutory exclusivity framew ork\u2014just like in the ar ea of pharmaceuticals\u2014a technological area must be subj ect to regulation by a dedicated and qualified impartial body, e.g. an executive agency, capable of administering the regulatory framework instituting the exclusivities regime. Such a body ought to routinel y regulate the pertinen t technological area or have direct bearing to that par ticular area and must have a substantial amount of expertise in evaluating technologies in that ar ea. Given its particular expe rtise, arguably, such a body would be better suited than the USPTO to evaluate rele vant technologies in its area of expertise and would therefore be in a better position to make merit assessments with respect to such technologies from a public benefit perspective. 236 Notably, such an approach is in concert with the Federal Circuit's general approach of adapting the legal framework to particular areas of technology. See Aljalian, supra note 168, at 18-19 (\"patent scope has come to be largely dependent on the technology at issue. The Federal Circuit actively tailors patent law and policy to the technology under consideration. This new approach is vi ewed as having 'a significant impact' on advances in technology and various industries.\"). This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. A second prerequisite for the implementation of statutory exclusivities regimes is that the practical application of technol ogy in the regulated area would require some kind of regulatory approval or the removal of a regulatory bar. This requirement is essential for the administration of statutory exclusivities regimes because it is the withholding of the approval to use the technology or the imposition of the regulatory bar that would effectuate the exclusivities. Notably, once a technological area is recognized as a potential candidate for the implementation of a statutory exclusivity framework, it woul d be possible to fulfill the aforementioned prerequisites\u2014the regulation of the technologic al area by a dedicated and qualified impartial body and the existence of a requirement for regulat ory approval or removal of a regulatory bar in order to put technology in that area into practical application \u2014via appropriate legislation. Statutory exclusivities regimes would be, prim arily, suitable in ar eas of technology in which (1) additional incentives to invent/invest are necessary because the existing incentives provided under patent law are insu fficient, and/or (2) the circumstances of the particular market pertaining to the regulated technological area lend themselves to inefficiencies such as abuse of market share. Statutory exclusivities regimes ought not to be considered in areas that do not call for additional incentives, e.g., areas in which development of technology is relatively cheap, does not require substantial amounts of know-how and expertise or th e risks of not recouping one's investments are low.237 Ideally, statutory exclusivities regimes should be implemented in technological areas that have high entry barriers\u2014financial, technological or both\u2014and where the prospects of return on investment are unp redictable or involve substantial risks. 237 Awarding statutory exclusivities in areas that do not require further incentives to invent, invest in R&D or disclose technology might work to achieve the opposite results. This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review. Please do not cite to this draft without prior approval by the author. As for the question of when, if ever, shou ld statutory exclusiv ities replace patents altogether, it is difficult to establish a bright line rule regarding the circumstances which would necessitate and justify such repl acement. However, as stated above, it is possible to propose some parameters that would, potentially, assist in identifying technological areas which may be suitable for excepting technology from protection unde r patent law in favor of protection under a statutory exclusivities regime. Presumably, these areas would be such that exhibit extreme cases of the aforementioned characteristics, namely wher e patent protection provide s very little to no incentives (or even negative incentives238) to invent/invest or to disclose new technology and/or where the market in the tec hnology which utilizes the pertinent tec hnology is plagued by constant inefficiencies. Statutory exclusivitie s may be especially fitting as replacement for patents in technological areas th at are particularly susceptibl e or prone to patent abuse. Notably, the implementation of statutory exclus ivities regimes itself is also not devoid of risks of inefficiencies and abuse. With statut ory exclusivities regimes being based on reliance on expert regulators, risks of regulatory/ agency capture become more prominent.239 In the context of approvals of pharmaceutical products by the FDA, for example, this risk is evident in the fact that FDA personnel is in regular contact with represen tatives of certain co rporations who are prominent and repeated actors in the regulated area and who are also, frequently, former members of the FDA themselves. Being aware of such risks of regulatory/agency capture is 238 Hypothetically, there could be areas of technology where the traditional patent regime is so deficient that it actually creates negative incentives to invent/invest and/or disclose, in which case patent protection should be forgone and a statutory exclusivities regime ought to be made the sole method of protecting technology. 239 Regulatory/agency capture occurs when a regulatory body or agency created to regulate certain industries or sectors in the public interest, instead, advances the commerci al or special interests of th e industries or sectors of which it is charged with regulating.

VI. Conclusion The most important function of patents and stat utory exclusivities alike is to ensure that those partaking in technologica l R&D would not only survive to continue their activity but would also prosper and seek to continue their R&D activities in the future. However, in some technological areas, patents might not serve this purpose as well as statutory exclusiv ities would. 240 See generally Rachel Barkow, Insulating Agencies: Avoiding Capture Through Institutional Design , 89 Tex. L. Rev. 15 (2010). 241 See generally http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/vet_biologics/ . 242 See generally http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalPr ocedures/DeviceApprovalsa ndClearances/510kClearanc es/default.htm . 243 Notably, all of these areas are regulated by the Depart ment of Agriculture (DA) an d the FDA in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Unfortunately, the scope of this article does not allow for examination of the potential supplementation (or replacement) of patents with of statutory exclusivities.

This article does not purport to propose a \"patentless worl d\" or portray patents as dinosaurs\u2014ancient relics of a once glorious past . As explained above, statutory exclusivities would and should only serve as an addition to patents in a narrow class of well defined circumstances; the emergence of statutory exclus ivities should not be perceived as hailing the demise of the patent system. Yet, at least in some technological areas, pa tents may be a less than preferable way of promoting i nnovation and should be substituted by statutory exclusivities, where possible.244 Thus, this article advocates the subst itution of patent en forcement rights with statutory exclusivities of appr opriate lengths in those areas where there is a regulatory body capable of evaluating and granting licenses to partake in activities involving particular types of patentable technologies and in which the public has an inte rest in encouraging further technological development.245 Biologics represent such a case. As discussed in this article, in the context of generic biologics the statutory exclusivities instituted by BPCIA make primary patents re dundant and, by comparison, an inferior way of ensuring the proprietary interest s of developers of biological products in thei r technology. The statutory exclusivities afforded under BPCIA have been tailored to the needs of developers of 244 See 2008 CRS Report, supra note 1, at 18 (recognizing th at patents may not be \"the most successful mechanism for capturing the benefits of investment\" in every industry and arguing that \"[t]he utility of patents to companies varies among indust rial sectors\"). 245 This proposition coincides with Machlup's belief that [w]hile the student of the economics of the patent system must, provisionally, disqualify himself on the question of the effects of the system as a whole on a large industrial economy, he need not disqualify himself as a judge of proposed changes in the existing system. While economic analysis does not yet provide a basis for choosing between \"all or nothing,\" it does provide a sufficiently firm basis for decisions about \"a little more or a little less\" of various ingredients of the patent system. See Machlup, supra note 11, at 80. This article will be published in Volume 18 of the Michigan Telecommunications and Technology Law Review.

Allowing developers of biological products to benefit from the protection of primary patents along side and concurrent with such statutory exclusivities would cause waste and could lead to abuse of the patent system. Further, it is important to remember that patents, despite their long legal history and well known status as instruments of incentivizing innovation, are only a means to an e nd. Assuming this \"end\" is as well or even better served by other means ( e.g. statutory exclusivities), patents may lose their al lure and become redundant, and possibly even harmful. A substitution of pr imary patent enforcement rights where statutory exclusivities in FDA-approved biol ogical products are in force is the best means to incentivize continued investment in R&D wh ile guaranteeing sufficient public access to generi c versions of biological products.
