He received his medical degree from Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey. After finishing his neurology residency both in Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey, and at the University of Nebraska, he completed a two-year fellowship in clinical neurophysiology and epilepsy at the University of Virginia. Dr. Uysal came to the University of Kansas Medical Center in 2012. He is board certified in neurology, clinical neurophysiology and epilepsy by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology. He is also board certified in advanced central clinical neurophysiology with added competency in epilepsy monitoring by the American Board of Clinical Neurophysiology. Dr. Uysal's clinical interests are provoked or unprovoked seizures, epilepsy, refractory epilepsy, medical and surgical management of refractory epilepsy, antiepileptic drugs and status epilepticus in both outpatient and inpatient settings. Procedures he routinely performs are EEG, video EEG monitoring, intraoperative and extraoperative brain mapping and intraoperative neurophysiologic monitoring. His primary research interests are in surgical management of epilepsy, natural history of nonconvulsive status epilepticus, seizure biomarkers and antibiotic-induced seizures/status epilepticus.
