The ASD Project - [webdev.usu.edu/drc/facultytraining/intro0.htm](http://webdev.usu.edu/drc/facultytraining/intro0.htm) This computer-based course is intended to develop an awareness about accommodating students with disabilities. In your role as faculty, there is a little background information that may be helpful. Studies have shown that students with disabilities can participate in higher education and compete favorably with other students. Faculty FAQs What if I suspect that a student has a disability but hasn't provided me with any documentation from Disability Services? Can I ask them if they have a disability? We recommend not asking directly about a possible disability. The Americans with Disabilities Act states that a public entity may not make unnecessary inquiries into the existence of a disability. These inquiries usually relate to hiring or pre-admission screening, but when talking with students such inquiries should also be avoided. A direct inquiry such as this could also be considered intrusive or insensitive. You may simply tell the student that you notice they are having academic difficulty and encourage them to consider looking into support services available on campus (Disability Services would be considered a support service). We also recommend making statements or sharing concerns based on observable behavior (e.g., \"I noticed that you are struggling with X topic,\" \"It's important to participate more in class and I notice that you're not participating as much as other students in the course\"). What if a student comes to me at the end of the semester and tells me that they have a disability, but has not provided me with documentation from Disability Services? What if I disagree with an accommodation that is provided by Disability Services? [). We are here to support, guide, and consult with anything related to student accommodations. For further explanation regarding legal obligations of higher education institutions to provide accommodations for students with documented disabilities, please refer to page 1 of this guide which discusses the ADAA and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.](javascript:;) When is a student required to submit their accommodation letter to me? Students can begin the process and register with Disability Services at any time during their enrollment at Maryland University of Integrative Health. A student may provide you with a Faculty Contact Sheet at any time during your course. There are many different kinds of disabilities that vary significantly for each individual. Some conditions may not be static and the need for special instructional strategies or accommodations may change as the condition changes. However, please keep in mind that implementing accommodations begins at the time you receive the Faculty Contact Sheet; accommodations are not retroactive. What if I have provided the accommodations as outlined by Disability Services, but the student is still struggling in my class? A student who is registered with Disability Services is being extremely disruptive in my class and I'm not sure how to handle the situation. What should I do? Is my intellectual property at risk if I provide copies of my lecture notes in any form to a student? Learn About Faculty Responsibilities Faculty at Maryland University of Integrative Health have the right to: - Receive notification in writing from Disability Services and Accessibility of a student's need for accommodation. Faculty and staff do not have a right to access confidential disability documentation. - Contact Disability Services and Accessibility to clarify student requests for accommodation, academic adjustments, and/or auxiliary aids. Faculty at Maryland University of Integrative Health have the responsibility to: - Provide information to all students about the accommodation procedure in all course syllabi. - Refer students who have disclosed having a disability and a need for accommodations to Disability Services. - Provide accessible technology to his/her course (e.g., captioned video for deaf/hard of hearing students, web accessibility, accessible course materials). Please contact Center for Teaching and Learning for additional resources and assistance. - Alter the format of a testing procedure to measure proficiency in course knowledge based on the ability of the student, not the disability (e.g., for a student with limited speech ability: changing an oral exam to a written exam that includes multiple-choice or essay responses) - there may be an exception when the purpose of the test is to measure a particular skill. - Provide an opportunity to take a make-up exam in a timely fashion for students who miss exams for disability-related reasons. In these instances, Disability Services and Accessibility will work with faculty members when immediate access challenges cause barriers to students with disabilities, while maintaining the confidentiality of information regarding disability issues.
