CHICAGO \u2014 Delaying vending machines' delivery of tempting, high-calorie snacks can shift people's choices to less popular but healthier options, a first-of-its-kind, National Institutes of Health-funded study has found. Preventive medicine specialists at Rush University Medical Center examined people's snacking behavior at work to see if a vending machine time delay or price discount could influence people to make better, healthier snack choices. The results were published online in Appetite, an international research journal specializing in the influences on the selection and intake of foods and drinks. \"Having to wait for something makes it less desirable,\" said [Brad Appelhans, PhD](https://doctors.rush.edu/details/1824), a clinical psychologist at the Rush University Prevention Center and lead investigator of the study. \"Research shows that humans strongly prefer immediate gratification, and this preference influences choices and behavior in daily life.\" This behavior is known as delay discounting, which is the tendency to choose smaller immediate rewards over larger delayed rewards. \"We wanted to see if we could use this preference for immediate gratification to improve people's vending machine snack choices,\" Appelhans said. Vending machines are the most prevalent source of high-calorie snacks in the United States. There are 1.3 million snack vending machines across the U.S. For the study, Appelhans and his team at Rush developed a new vending machine and created a technology called the DISC system (Delays to Improve Snack Choices). The DISC vending machine system employs a \"delay\" bar that separates the healthier snacks from the less nutritious options. When an individual selects a less nutritious snack, the system begins a 25-second time delay before the machine releases the snack from the vending machine. It also has an LED screen, which displays the delay times for less healthy snack items, and a delivery countdown, which allows an individual to change their snack choice to a healthier option. \"This delay yielded a 2 percent to 5 percent increase in the proportion of total purchases from healthy snacks,\" Appelhans said. \"Also, we found that the delay did not harm total sales volume or vending revenue, which is important to vending machine operators.\" The study of the DISC vending machine system looked at the following six vending machine interventions in three locations between June 2015 and August 2016: The study assessed a total of 32,019 vending sales in a cumulative 602 observation days. \"Our findings with the DISC vending machine system suggests that relatively brief time delays can nudge people to purchase healthier snacks at least some of the time. The beneficial effect on snack choice is about as large as that seen with discounts, but unlike discounts, time delays do not harm the total revenue of vending machines,\" Appelhans said. \"This could be a viable option for vending machine owners to offer good, healthy snack options while keeping their sales and avoiding out-of-pocket costs.\" The DISC system color coded and labeled the healthy snacks to distinguish them from the regular, less healthy snack options. The machines also had clear signs indicating that regular, less healthy snacks would vend after a 25-second time delay. There was a touchscreen menu explaining the system delay mechanism and a countdown timer. The researchers also had specific criteria for healthy snacks vs. regular snacks. Healthy snacks must meet five of the seven following criteria: The study also compared the sales of snack items based on the location of vending machines in areas frequented by blue-collar or white-collar workers. The study found that sales of healthy snacks even without the time delay and no intervention was significantly higher in vending machines in the white collar location, at 47.3 percent of sales, compared to the blue collar location, where healthy snacks accounted for 36.6 percent of purchases. Also, the combination of a delay and price discount produced a larger improvement in healthy snack purchasing in the blue collar location than in the white collar location. \"There is a major need for new dietary intervention strategies that combat obesity-promoting factors in the environment,\" Appelhans said. \"Obesity and poor diet are strong risk factors for heart disease, stroke and diabetes.\" \"Vending machines are conveniently located, have a broad reach and are the most prevalent source of high-calorie, nutrient-poor foods in the U.S.,\" Appelhans said. \"They are not going anywhere any time soon, so this new vending machine system could be an effective and financially viable strategy that can shift individuals' choices towards healthier options.\" This technology is protected by a PCT patent application. Tomorrow's scientists have opportunities to conduct studies across a wide range of discplines in health care and make an impact. We conduct frontline research across the spectrum of bioengineering, brain research and neuroscience, new advances in pharma, and big data approaches to solving critical health challenges. Our students go on to jobs researching breakthrough medications to biomedical research jobs developing the next generation of hip or knee prosthesis. Some of the fastest-growing and most-rewarding careers in health are open to skilled graduates with a [master's degree or doctorate in biomedical research](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/graduate-college/academic-programs/masters-biomedical-sciences). People unfamiliar with current trends in biomedical research may picture a lonely scientist in a lab coat peering over a microscope to discover a new pathogen. This does happen, and the study of viruses, bacteria and other pathogens continues to be a vital part of medical research, but other work in the field encompasses diverse scientific research ranging from, for example, better ways for individuals with intellectual disabilities to communicate or developing new cochlear implants to help people with hearing deficits. A simple definition for biomedical research is: postgraduate or doctoral research in any field related to medicine and biology that has the potential to heal and improve lives. According to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/medical-scientists.htm), a biomedical scientist conducts research to improve human health. Biochemists focus on the chemistry of biological processes, including cell functioning and disease processes. Biophysicists study the physical principles underlying life and living things. Epidemiologists work within the public health domain to investigate how diseases spread and reduce their spread. Clinical biomedical researchers analyze biological material in laboratories in hospitals, clinics or as part of research teams. Biomedical engineers design equipment that can interface with the human body, including prosthetics. At Rush all these professionals and more work together on integrated teams to jointly solve important health problems. Depending on their specialty, a biomedical research scientist can work with other scientists as part of a research team. Medical research no longer takes place exclusively in labs. Biomedical research can take place in the community. For example, a biomedical research scientist could develop a way for children with autism spectrum disorder to communicate better with peers and study their method's effectiveness in a school or community-based clinic. Researchers studying Parkinson's disease could work with patients and their families to discover whether or not family members can help improve disease outcomes or daily functioning. Teams developing new drugs or treatment methods for diseases like diabetes can work in both the laboratory and community clinic settings. Biomedical research jobs may focus on any area of the health care system, from pharmaceutical research to community health. Philanthropic organizations, professional societies as well as the federal government may provide research grants for a broad range of biomedical projects. A biomedical scientist could work as part of a team studying environmental concerns, socioeconomic trends and large-scale population trends. Some biomedical research scientists conduct studies with subjects wearing biometric devices that can monitor individual health indicators, while others are developing ways to restore or improve brain function after illness or injury. Other biomedical scientist jobs could be involved with developing new cancer therapy or developing new imaging techniques to detect early disease. Medical research takes place in many environments, including within college or university research labs. Federal government agencies employ many biomedical researchers and through grants also fund additional research in specific diseases. Private businesses require biomedical scientists, both through the pharmaceutical industry and the medical device industry. Big data analysis also plays a role in biomedical research and data analysis roles are another avenue for biomedical research. Hospitals and clinics employ biomedical researchers, who may study disease processes and public health trends. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that the median salary for a medical scientist was $80,530 per year as of 2016. Biomedical engineers had a median salary of $85,620 per year in 2016, the BLS found. Where biomedical scientists work will influence their average pay, as well as their area of specialty, education and experience. Scientists working in the pharmaceutical industry earned an average of $113,800 a year, according to the BLS Occupational Outlook Handbook. Research and development scientists working in engineering, life sciences and physical sciences (biophysicists) earned $95,120 a year on average. With more than 24,200 biomedical research scientists, California is the state with the highest level of employment in the field, according to the BLS. California medical research scientists earned more than $105,000 a year in 2016, the BLS reported. Other states with high levels of employment opportunity in the field include New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Maryland. Biomedical scientists in Maryland earned more than $107,000 a year on average, according to the BLS. Many medical researchers become interested in further research after working as a physician, nurse or in a related field, such as dentistry. Researchers who have bachelor's degrees in chemistry, biology or similar bioscience fields can opt to enter [PhD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/graduate-college/academic-programs/doctor-philosophy-integrated-biomedical-sciences) [ programs](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/graduate-college/academic-programs/doctor-philosophy-integrated-biomedical-sciences). Some researchers may choose to enter dual degree programs where they will earn an MD or an advanced nursing degree and a PhD. Medical research can begin while candidates are undergraduates, gaining experience in laboratory work and principles of ethical research. Some medical research scientists have [master's degrees](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/graduate-college) and experience in data analysis and modeling. Postdoctoral programs offer additional experience and opportunities to supervise other research team members. Although students may begin performing medical research as part of their undergraduate education, most biomedical research scientists have doctoral or master's degrees and additional specialized education in data analysis or bioengineering. Gene therapy and drug trial researchers must have an MD and be licensed to practice medicine. [Learn about Rush University's biomedical research programs.](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/graduate-college) Stem cell treatments have potential to transform medicine. Experts in cancer, neurosurgery, orthopedics and pediatrics discuss the possibilities. The use of stem cells in medical treatments already is yielding exciting results and may yield greater medical advances in the future. At a recent event hosted by Rush University Medical Center, experts at Rush discussed the role of stem cells in neurosurgery, orthopedics, pediatrics and oncology and how their breakthrough research may dramatically improve the lives of people afflicted by disease and severe injury. An edited transcript of that discussion appears below. [Larry Goodman, MD](https://www.rush.edu/about-us/about-rush/leadership-biographies/larry-j-goodman-md-about-rush), CEO of Rush University Medical Center and [the Rush system](https://www.rush.edu/about-us/about-rush/rush-system), moderated the conversation. The panelists included [Brian Cole, MD, MBA](https://doctors.rush.edu/details/1079), professor in the [Department of Orthopedic Surgery](https://www.rush.edu/services/orthopedic-surgery) and section head of the [Center Cartilage Restoration](https://www.rush.edu/services/cartilage-restoration-center) at Rush; [Richard G. Fessler, Surgery](https://www.rush.edu/services/neurological-surgery); MD](https://doctors.rush.edu/details/16863), and Cell Therapy](https://www.rush.edu/services/cancer-center); and Anna Spagnoli, MD, the Woman's Board Chair of the [Department of Pediatrics](https://www.rush.edu/services/pediatric-primary-care). Larry Goodman: First let me spend one minute or so on stem cells. They're a big part of regenerative medicine with a lot of potential. They're cells that can literally divide into other types of cells in the body. The idea to have a cell that possibly divides into either a liver cell, or a pancreas cell, or a spinal cord cell when you most need it is pretty exciting. That said, I've asked each of the panelists to spend a few minutes summarizing either their research or the way they use stem cells in regenerative medicine in their area. Timothy Kuzel: We've been basically using stem cells for 40 years, and when we first started, we actually didn't know those were stem cells. We harvested bone marrow from a donor, re-infused it in the recipient, and the idea was to regenerate the bone marrow and protect the patient from the lethal effects of high doses of [chemotherapy](https://www.rush.edu/services/test-treatment/chemotherapy) and [radiation](https://www.rush.edu/services/test-treatment/radiation-therapy) for their cancer. We naively assumed that it was the chemo and the radiation that were actually curing patients with [a bone marrow transplant](https://www.rush.edu/services/stem-cell-and-bone-marrow-transplantation) for acute [leukemia](https://www.rush.edu/services/leukemia-services). It took us about 20 years to begin to understand what a stem cell was. We began to collect stem cells without even bone marrow harvest, which was good. But we learned something even more important. We learned that it was regenerating the immune system of the patient that actually allowed the cancer to be treated. That's permitted us to greatly reduce the chemotherapy and the radiation doses we give to patients. Now we give just enough to allow those stem cells to move into the host, grow and flourish and develop and attack the immune system. Now, that's all well and good. We treat leukemia and [lymphoma](https://www.rush.edu/services/lymphoma-services) patients that way even today. But the field has embraced the whole idea of [immunotherapy](https://www.rush.edu/news/breakthrough-cancer-drugs-last) now. Nowadays we talk about regenerating the immune system in patients to recognize cancers as really foreign tissue and to attack them. We can do that without stem cells. We can do that just recruiting and regenerating the patient's own immune system. So a lot of the fundamental advances in stem cell, bone marrow transplant, stem cell transplant, have really led to us being able to really treat all kinds of cancers now. Brian Cole: I'm an orthopedic surgeon, but the reality is probably 80 to 90 percent of my day is spent doing non-surgical things. The things that I'm mostly interested in are dealing with problems with tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and things of that matter. Inherently all of us actually have stem cells in our bodies that we can recruit. In fact, some of the treatments we use in the area of repairing cartilage utilize cells that we can recruit. For example, in the knee, by just poking small holes in the bone we recruit those stem cells, some of the bone marrow stem cells that Dr. Kuzel just was talking about. Our interests are now in the area of osteoarthritis. [Osteoarthritis](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/osteoarthritis) is obviously a very common disease. The way that we use stem cells for it are to sort of take advantage of them as almost like little pharmacies that have growth factors and very important proteins that can either act independently or recruit your own body's stem cells into the area to treat the symptoms of arthritis. These are ways to reduce symptoms. We're not to the point where we can regenerate an entire joint or take an individual who is slated to have a [joint replacement](https://www.rush.edu/services/joint-replacement-surgery-program) and prevent them from needing that replacement. But what we can do are treat symptoms in an office setting that are otherwise untreatable. Mostly what I do is to reduce pain and improve function, and do that long enough that it makes sense. The other area of interest is in helping [rotator cuff repairs](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/rotator-cuff-injury) to stay healed, and much of our existing efforts are in what's known as biologic surgery. We aim to optimize the outcomes of surgeries by helping the body to heal more predictably. Anna Spagnoli: I am a pediatrician, and I have been taking care for many years of children with genetic bone diseases like [osteogenesis imperfecta](https://www.rush.edu/kids/services-conditions/osteogenesis-imperfecta-children) that cause the bones to be brittle. These are children that can have many fractures in their lives, and we still don't have a treatment for them. The exciting thing that is happening with my research program is that we have discovered that stem cells can actively regenerate fractured bones. Our findings can help those children, as well patients that fail bone fracture healing. Twenty percent of the patients that fracture do not heal. So that's 600,000 people in the U.S. that do not heal. We discovered ways to make stem cells to become \"smart stem cells\" and improve fracture repair. Stem cells are present in many places of the body. Our research has led to the discovery of ways to direct those cells to the place where they are needed, and to repair the part of the body that is damaged, in the case of our patients with a fractured bone. What we discovered is that, yes the bones have stem cells, but they need special factors to actually be used be recruited within a fracture and to become bone cells. One of these factors is called AMD3100. It's a drug already in clinical practice and used to treat patients that receive bone marrow transplant. We found that if we combine stem cells with this drug, the cells are directed toward the fracture where they regenerate the bone. We are now looking at clinical trials to combine a patient's own stem cells, so called autologous stem cells, with AMD3100 to treat patients that fail fracture repair. Our lab has also discovered that joints have stem cells. This is an important discovery. The observation that joints are not able to heal had led scientists to wrongly believe that joints did not have stem cells. What we found was that the stem cells are not only present in the joints, but they actually make anti-inflammatory factors. Therefore, in patients with osteoarthritis stem cells can be useful not only to repair the joints but also to decrease the inflammation and to control the pain. Richard Fessler: I have been treating patients with spinal cord injury for 30 years, and I've done research in this area of spinal cord injury for about 20 years. We have known about spinal cord injuries since 5000 years ago. The treatment at that time was to not treat them, to let them die. In the succeeding 5000 years, we have made essentially no progress. So about a year and a half ago, the FDA approved us to do transplantation into patients who are paralyzed in the neck. Now that's a big deal. These cells only have to grow a centimeter or two, and we can return one level of function. In our study we just recently released the [12-month results](https://www.rush.edu/news/press-releases/regenerative-medicine-restores-movement-after-paralysis) of patients who receive 10 million cells injected into their spinal cord. Of these patients, 100 percent got one level back. 60 percent got two levels back, and one patient got three levels back. For the first time in recorded history, we have made progress in reversing spinal cord injury. We haven't cured it. It's like cancer. Fifty years ago, cancer was a death sentence. Now, many are curable. There was a period in between there where they weren't quite curable but they were partially treatable. I think we've made that step in spinal cord injury. It's not curable, it's now partially treatable. Goodman: I obviously have a lot more questions for these panelists, but I thought we would do is open this up to all of you. Audience member: Do younger people respond better than older people for this kind of stuff, regeneration? Fessler: Our next study will be a randomized study, and we hope to be able to do them in younger patients. Kids get better, adults not so much. Spinal cord injury happens to young people. It's young male injuries it happens to most. If I could do 14-year-olds, 16-year-olds, those are the people that really have a chance to do better. So I hope we can go that way. Goodman: Osteogenesis imperfecta is a younger person's problem, isn't it? osteogenesis imperfecta affects children. The reason why osteogenesis imperfecta is treatable with stem cells is that even if stem cells would make a partial replacement of the bad protein that the bones of those patients make, it would be enough to prevent them from fracturing. Osteogenesis imperfecta was one of the first diseases in which stem cells were tried. In patients treated with stem cells, we proved that they were able to make the correct protein and patients showed some promising improvements. What we need to learn is actually how to modify the stem cells so that they stay within the bones and they last for the life of the patients. Audience member: In light of the past controversy regarding the use of stem cells, what is the current political status of using stem cells in research? Fessler: We can only do stem cell lines that were approved in 1996. There were eight stem cell lines. It turns out, the one we're using is a good one. But we would like to create other stem cell lines. Socially it will become less of an issue, because we're learning the techniques to take cells and regress them to a primitive state and then regrow them into what we want. Once that's done, our access to stem cells will be much easier. Audience member: There are some small clinics offering treatment with stem cells, especially for knee injuries. In your opinion, how credible are those people? Cole: It's an area of concern, and it's one of the things that we take very seriously, because the barrier to entry is very low when it comes to the use of something called a stem cell in orthopedics. The United States has the largest stem cell tourism industry in the world right now. It's not particularly regulated, although over the next year that may change. The FDA is clearly cracking down, because every one of these technologies has no label for the use of arthritis, no clinical proof that it can do formal regeneration or stave off the knee for knee replacement and regenerate the joint. I always tell people, it's really buyer beware. Spagnoli: It's a very important question because for the investigators that are doing stem cell research. We are very worried that patients receiving stem cells in uncontrolled and unregulated places can be harmed, and this will not only have an effect on the patient but may stop the research on stem cells. This is the reason that we are seeking regulations for stem cell research and to have controlled clinical trials. Fessler: General rule of thumb, if they're asking for cash, be very wary. Audience member: What is the impact on stem cell research on longevity? Are people being treated living longer than normal? Kuzel: I think there's no doubt that the longevity of the individual patient who gets a bone marrow transplant or who gets cellular therapy, for example a child with refractory ALL treated with some of our new cell therapies, find their longevity is greatly improved because they're cured of a horrible malignancy. But for the healthy person, probably stem cells aren't the issue for a healthy person. You've got other programmed pathways in your body. Learning how to turn them off is probably more important than giving stem cells. Goodman: Let me take this opportunity to thank our panel. We really appreciate the great job they did tonight. As you think about what we've talked about tonight, there are a couple of other areas to just remember about. Right now, there are not enough [transplants](https://www.rush.edu/services/transplant-programs) for the people who need them. If you can figure out a way to make islet cells of the pancreas work and be reenergized to make insulin, suddenly [diabetes](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/diabetes) could go away without [a pancreatic transplant](https://www.rush.edu/services/pancreas-transplant-program) or without insulin. [Liver transplants](https://www.rush.edu/services/liver-transplant-program), all those things could be a target for this kind of therapy. [Parkinson's disease](https://www.rush.edu/services/parkinsons-disease-and-movement-disorders-program) is a neurological disease that is a problem in a very small part of the brain. They just are not making dopamine anymore. If you can figure out a way to reactivate whatever stem cells might be there, get that going again, suddenly not only don't you need L-dopa, but the problem with most of the anti-Parkinson's disease drugs is they kind of wear out after about a decade or so. Then you're on second line and third line drugs. None of that might be needed if stem cell research actually works the way the promise is. Tonight you heard about examples of it already working, and our hope is we're back again in five or ten years with some patients that have really been remarkably changed by this research. An active volunteer, Emil Maric is gaining experience in the Graduate College's accelerated master's in biotechnology program as he prepares for medical school. A gap year wasn't part of Emil Maric's original plan. Rather, Maric \u2014 who received his bachelor's degree from Illinois Wesleyan, in Bloomington, Illinois, last spring \u2014 hoped to jump right into medical school after graduation and a summer break. The only problem: He didn't receive an acceptance letter. After some introspection and honest reflection, Maric realized why. He needed to acquire more of the relevant experience desired by many medical schools. With that in mind, Maric found what he calls his stepping stone to medical school: the one-year accelerated [biotechnology master of science program](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/graduate-college/academic-programs/biotechnology-masters-degree-program) offered at the [Graduate College](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/graduate-college) at Rush University. Below, Maric describes how he came to realize that this program offered him the greatest chance of pursuing his dream of becoming a physician. Originally, I applied to medical school and didn't get in. In retrospect, that wasn't too surprising. I went into the application process at full throttle during college, assuming I'd get in somewhere but not really considering the quality of my application or my experiences. I put my ego aside, looked at my application and realized that I lacked a strong research and U.S. volunteering background. In fact, I had no research experience prior to coming to the Graduate College, and I hadn't volunteered here in the U.S. at all. A biotechnology degree in the Graduate College at Rush University offered me the opportunity to fill those gaps. My interest in science and how bodies work came at an early age, and I always wanted to help people in a meaningful way. As a teen, I volunteered on mission trips in Honduras and in the Dominican Republic. I had the opportunity to help clinical teams and saw how needed doctors were in rural areas. I remember one day that had a big impact on me. As I helped clean instruments following a medical procedure, a man walked up to me and said thank you to me in English, which wasn't his native language. I knew right then that we were making a difference, and I wanted to become a doctor. A recent experience helped affirm this aspiration. My aunt, who lived in Bosnia and Herzegovina, died from colon cancer the week after I came to Rush, and my parents went there immediately. We have visited Bosnia and Herzegovina regularly since moving to the U.S. when I was about 3. During my visits there, I've seen an extremely poor country that is ravaged by poverty and corruption. Even some doctors are corrupt. When my parents arrived, they found that my aunt couldn't get the appropriate care from doctors because she wasn't rich and couldn't pay the doctors off. That sort of corruption pushes me to want to help people in third world countries as well as in the U.S. as a physician. I want to help those who don't have access or insurance. I volunteer at a Cook County jail right now through Rush University. I'm a student facilitator of health education classes, and I'm paired with medical students who lead the classes. In the classes, we address topics such as diabetes and cancer, which is clearly a need. We recently did a program on men's health, and I was so surprised by the questions that were asked. For example, questions about sexually transmitted diseases indicated that there was a fair amount of misinformation surrounding transmission and prevention. I also volunteer at a hospice. This experience has really been illuminating and shows a different side of medicine. Here, it's about letting people die in a humane way, letting them die in a serene setting with loved ones if possible. This experience has really helped me see medicine in a new way, with doctors helping people die in peace. Well, we are digging into our capstone research projects right now. With a partner, I'm testing different assays for calcium deposits in tissues to evaluate their effectiveness looking at Peyronie's disease. And we recently finished a class that taught us how to implant saline pumps and approaches to surgeries that prevent excessive bleeding and damage to tissues. These are all techniques I hope to apply as a physician. If your plan is to go to medical school, I suggest taking a gap year and pursuing a degree or experience that will be applicable to medical school. My situation wasn't unique; I don't think most people get into medical school right after college. Pursuing a master's degree like the one offered through the biotechnology program at Rush can make a difference. We study topics that translate well to the field of medicine, such as organ and immune systems, tissue biology and pharmacology. And when you go to a school like Rush, you are exposed to volunteer opportunities that can deepen your interests in serving communities in addition to strengthening your medical school applications down the line. Find yourself a stepping stone. I was upset when I didn't get into medical school right away, but now I look at this master's program \u2014 my stepping stone \u2014 as the best thing to have happened to me. Rush researcher Susan Chubinskaya, PhD, is helping lead a study that aims to make space travel easier on astronauts, while providing insights for the rest of us here on Earth. Weightlessness takes a paradoxically heavy toll on astronauts who spend extended periods of time in zero gravity. A researcher at Rush is helping lead a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study that's trying to help make space travel easier on astronauts, and that also may yield insights into the progression, prevention and even possible cure of trauma-induced osteoarthritis for the rest of us here on Earth. [Susan Chubinskaya, PhD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/susan-chubinskaya-phd), the Klaus Kuettner Professor of Osteoarthritis Research at Rush, will work with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Alan Grodzinsky, ScD, a biomedical engineer, and Vicki Rosen, PhD, a developmental biologist at Harvard School of Dental Medicine, to test the effects of the \"microgravity\" of space on damaged knee and ankle cartilage. The study is one of the five 2017 Tissue Chips in Space Projects to be conducted aboard the International Space Station (ISS) United States National Laboratory, with funding from the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), a branch of the NIH. \"We have been collaborating with MIT on multiple projects for more than 20 years. This new project is a natural extension of that partnership\" says Chubinskaya, whose own research focuses on how human joint tissue responds to injury. Under her supervision, Rush will provide human joints from organ donors for the project and will assist with culture experiments and analysis of tissue responses to injuries. Tissue Chips in Space is a collaboration between NCATS and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space, or [CASIS](https://www.iss-casis.org/about/about-the-iss-national-lab/), the nonprofit, nongovernmental organization that manages the ISS. The overall endeavor will investigate human physiology and disease aboard the ISS with an eye to improving the health of astronauts, who [lose bone mineral density](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/osteoporosis) if they are in microgravity for long, and are prone to joint injuries during their routine exercises while in orbit. \"They experience a lot of changes in their muscular skeletal system, and when they come back, it's not that simple to recover. They need treatment, and we need to understand what happens with the joints while they're up there,\" Chubinskaya says. While the other projects will employ tissue-chip technology \u2014 tiny models of human organs \u2014 the MIT-Rush collaboration on ISS will use dozens of small samples of human knee and ankle components known as osteochondral units, which contain cartilage and bone, along with synovial tissue, a type of connective tissue specific to joints. This model replicates the environment within knee and ankle joints. The samples will be contained in small culture tubes that will each spend a month in space (the scientists in the program will remain on the ground). Because of Rush's long relationship with [Gift of Hope](https://www.giftofhope.org/), the federally designated nonprofit agency that coordinates organ and tissue donation in parts of Illinois and Indiana, Rush has access to donated human joints for research. Osteoarthritis is the most common chronic condition of the joints and a leading cause of pain and disability among adults 60 and older. The condition, which can be disabling and expensive to treat, occurs when cartilage (connecting tissue) between joints breaks down. The bones then rub together, causing pain and stiffness. The cartilage can deteriorate for any of a number of reasons, including overuse or [obesity](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/obesity). Trauma (damage) to young people's joints in accidents or sports injuries also is a common and pernicious cause of osteoarthritis, and post-traumatic osteoarthritis will be the focus of the ISS experiments. The problem can take a dozen or more years to develop after an injury, but then can require [joint replacement](https://www.rush.edu/services/joint-replacement-surgery-program), and even multiple replacements for the same joint over an individual's lifetime. (A replacement joint may only last 10 to 15 years, and post-traumatic osteoarthritis occurs earlier in life than age-related spontaneous osteoarthritis.) Post-traumatic osteoarthritis accounts for [about 12 percent ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17106388?dopt=Abstract)of symptomatic osteoarthritis in hips, knees and ankles. The study's primary focus will be on the mechanisms of post-traumatic osteoarthritis and the effects of certain drugs on the disease course on Earth and in microgravity. \"We are trying to model joint injury in order to understand the processes responsible for joint deterioration both on Earth and in space.\" Chubinskaya says \"We want to find out how to slow down the progression of the disease, or even prevent it.\" In Chubinskaya's and Grodzinsky's labs, healthy donor joint cartilage is deliberately and forcefully injured. Then samples of the damaged cartilage and accompanying synovial tissue are steeped in a \"cocktail of cytokines, the inflammatory mediators we know are released as a result of this impaction,\" Chubinskaya says. The research team hopes to learn \"what controls the degradations\" in the tissue after injury, so they can home in on effective treatments. After developing the tissue culture model, the researchers will use it to test five treatment options, including anti-inflammatory small molecule drugs that suppress inflammation and growth factors that stimulate tissue repair and regeneration. \"The same approach then will be taken into space,\" Chubinskaya says. The researchers will have a chance to see how microgravity affects the progression of osteoarthritis and the effectiveness of the five treatments. The samples will be aboard the ISS for a month, currently planned to be this December. After they return to Earth, the researchers will analyze them for appearance and multiple biological markers of disease progression, just as they will have done for the samples tested in the Earth labs. They'll compare the results with the findings of the Earth experiments. \"The data may increase understanding of trauma-induced osteoarthritis in both conditions and for both the general public and astronauts,\" Chubinskya says. Jesus Gonzalez watched his migrant farmer father's crops wither away and die. He wanted to know why and with that question began his journey as a scientist. September 12, 2017 A native of Eagle Pass, Texas, young Jesus Gonzalez watched as his migrant farmer father's backyard crops withered away and died. He wanted to know why. And with that simple question, Gonzalez began his journey as a scientist. This journey would lead him to becoming the first person in his family to earn a four-year college degree and the first to pursue an advanced degree. It would lead him right to Rush University, where he is currently a second-year student in the [master of science in medical laboratory science program](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-health-sciences/academic-programs/master-science-medical-laboratory-science) in the [College of Health Sciences](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/college-health-sciences). We asked Gonzalez to share with us the experiences that brought him from Eagle Pass, Texas, to Rush University, as well as his insights about the medical laboratory science program. Jesus Gonzalez: When I was younger, both my parents were migrant farm workers, traveling outside of Texas during planting and harvest seasons. At home, my father cared for his own crops. One year, most of his crops died. I wanted to understand why that had happened, so I created my own science project. Most of my dad's plants had brown spots on them. I wanted to demonstrate how something had spread from one plant to another, eventually killing each plant. To do that, I grew two tomato plants: one I surrounded with the remains of diseased plants; the second, I planted without the diseased remains. In the first one, the brown spots did spread, and I was able to stop the spread of infection by using commercial chemicals. While I didn't win the science fair - not even close - from that point on, my interest in bacteria, viruses and disease really peaked. And that's why I went to the University of Texas in Austin, where I received my bachelor's degree in microbiology. I was the first in my family to graduate from a four-year college, so my parents were incredibly proud. When I told them I wanted to get a master's degree in medical laboratory science as well, they were ecstatic. What really appealed to me about medical laboratory science in particular is the fact that I can perform similar kinds of experiments in the lab, ones in which I identify a culprit and help someone out in the process. I knew I was done with the Texas heat; it was unbearable. I wanted to find a graduate program somewhere else. When visiting family in Chicago for a football game, I told them about my plan to go to graduate school outside of Texas. They said that Chicago had many wonderful universities. I really liked Chicago, so I began to research them. Rush University, I found, had exactly what I was looking for: a master's degree program in medical laboratory science. I was really impressed by the program's statistics, especially the board certification and job placement rates. All the classes pertain to identifying what's wrong with the patient. In hematology, we learn about blood cells and how they're altered in diseases like leukemia and lymphomas. In microbiology, we learn about the many types of bacteria and what tests evaluate them. And in chemistry, we learn about hormones, enzymes and glucose levels. All of it relates back to our ultimate goal: to find out why a patient is sick. I especially liked clinical immunohematology, which relates to blood banks and how transfusions can go right ... or wrong. I enjoyed that class the most because it was like solving a puzzle, and I love puzzles. We looked at how different blood types work together and what fits. Like a crossword puzzle, you work until you find a perfect match. When you do, it's pretty gratifying. I've also had the chance to work on research projects. For example, we looked at more cost-effective ways to effectively test for transplant compatibility. I've also appreciated the opportunity to work at the Rush Blood Center. In fact, my job assisting with specimen processing really helped with my classwork. Through osmosis, I've learned so much from the lab techs there. Well, now I know that Chicago-style pizza in Texas is a joke. Here, it's actually good! I've really loved the change of scenery and have enjoyed the city vibe. Living near Greektown, I get to explore new restaurants and find ways to relax, like going to the beach or Millennium Park. It's fun just being a tourist. And, finally, I've experienced a real winter! It is a lot of work. You are being trained to be a generalist, so the program covers many disciplines in the field. It can move very quickly, but the faculty is here to help you through it. Ask a million questions and they'll give you a million answers; they'll sit with you and explain what you don't understand in ways you will understand. My advice for new students is to really try to see the \"why\" behind your work. Understanding why tests are being run and why they are done in a certain way will help you understand your role as a medical laboratory scientist and the roles of others in the hospital as well. That way, you can all come together for the patient in the best way possible. Work! School is great, but I've been attending classes since I was 6. I hope to get a job as a medical laboratory scientist at a big hospital in Chicago. The temperatures here, so far, agree with me. The symposium showcased presentations by students, residents and postdoctoral research fellows either from underrepresented minorities in science or working on topics relevant to diversity and inclusion in biomedical research. March 3, 2017 This week the 34th annual Rush University Forum for Research and Clinical Investigation also played host to the first symposium on research and diversity at Rush. The symposium, sponsored by the [Rush Initiative to Maximize Student Development](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/graduate-college/initiative-maximize-student-development-rush-imsd), or IMSD, showcased presentations by students, residents and postdoctoral research fellows either from underrepresented minorities in science or working on topics relevant to diversity and inclusion in biomedical research. \"During the preparation for this symposium, we had a view into the rich research environment related to this topic, which has not received special attention until now,\" says Gabriella Cs-Szabo, PhD, associate dean of [the Graduate College](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/graduate-college) and IMSD program coordinator. \"We are delighted to continue with this symposium for years to come to bring together a diverse research community and initiate collaboration and idea-sharing in the field of diversity.\" From 27 submissions to the symposium, five were selected for their outstanding scientific merit. These presenters covered topics spanning community engagement, to challenges in recruiting African-Americans for clinical studies, to basic questions about the regulation of growth of cancer cells. \"Linking the Rush IMSD symposium on research and diversity with the annual Rush research forum highlights our greater mission of aligning this program to Rush's overall vision and mission on inclusion and diversity,\" says Lena Al-Harthi, PhD, IMSD program director and associate chairperson in the Department of Immunity and Emerging Pathogens.

The community project she works on, Salud comunitaria y la escuela, shares similar aims. The Training Research-Literate Chaplains program announced its first chaplain research fellows and curriculum development grant recipients (Chicago) The Training Research-Literate Chaplains as Ambassadors for Spirituality and Health program announced the selection of its first cohort of chaplain research fellows and of the first recipients of the program's clinical pastoral education curriculum development grants. The fellowships and grants are part of Training Research-Literate Chaplains' efforts to advance knowledge about religion and health in health care organizations and among the public. The Training Research-Literate Chaplains program is a joint effort by the Department of Health, Religion and Human Values at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago and the Department of Sociology at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. The project seeks to close the gap between hospital chaplains' current limited research literacy and the importance of evidence-based care for all members of the health care team. \"Health care chaplains have embraced the importance of evidence-based practice but lack the training to realize it,\" said program co-leader [George Fitchett, DMin, PhD](http://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/george-fitchett-dmin-phd), professor and director of research in the Rush Department of Religion, Health and Human Values. \"More interdisciplinary collaboration and a growing understanding of how religion and spirituality can positively affect patient health means hospital chaplains are increasingly important members of a patient's care team.\" The fellowships will pay for 16 board-certified chaplains to complete a two-year, research-focused Master of Science or Master of Public Health degree in epidemiology, biostatistics or public health at an accredited school of public health. Selected from among a competitive pool, the first cohort of eight fellows are gathering for a kickoff conference from July 27 to 29 at Rush. The conference will bring together the fellows and members of the Training Research-Literate Chaplains' leadership and advisory committees to open the conversations on chaplaincy research. The clinical pastoral education (CPE) grants will be given to 70 CPE programs - which provide the training required to be a hospital chaplain \u2014 to incorporate research literacy into their curricula. The first cohort consists of 38 centers and will reach 237 student health care chaplains. The Training Research-Literate Chaplains' third initiative, a free, online education for chaplains entitled \"Religion, Spirituality and Health: An Introduction to Research,\" will be made available in 2017 at no cost to practicing chaplains who are members of the supporting professional chaplaincy organizations. \"We are thrilled with the opportunities this program is offering to chaplains with a range of backgrounds and experiences,\" said Wendy Cadge, PhD, program co-leader and professor of sociology at Brandeis. \"The first group of fellows and CPE centers will do much to bridge the gaps between chaplains and other members of the healthcare team. We are grateful to the John Templeton Foundation and the sponsoring chaplaincy organizations for giving all of us this opportunity.\" The Training Research-Literate Chaplains program is funded by $4.5 million in grants from the John Templeton Foundation with additional support from the Association of Professional Chaplains, the Association of Clinical Pastoral Education, the National Association of Catholic Chaplains, and Neshama - Association of Jewish Chaplains. The first cohort of chaplain research fellows includes the following members: The CPE programs at the following institutions are the recipients of the first round of clinical pastoral education grants: For more information about the Training Research-Literate Chaplains as Ambassadors for Spirituality and Health program, please contact [kathryn_lyndes@rush.edu](mailto:Kathryn_Lyndes@rush.edu).

Eating cinnamon might improve learning ability, according to a new study by Rush University Medical Center neuroscientists. By Deb Song Cinnamon is a delicious addition to toast, coffee and breakfast rolls. Eating the tasty household spice also might improve learning ability, according to new study results published online in the July issue of the Journal of Neuroimmune Pharmacology. The study by neurological scientists at Rush University Medical Center found that feeding cinnamon to laboratory mice determined to have poor learning ability made the mice better learners. \"This would be one of the safest and the easiest approaches to convert poor learners to good learners,\" said [Kalipada Pahan, PhD](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/faculty/kalipada-pahan-phd), the lead researcher of the study and the Floyd A. Davis Professor of Neurology at Rush. Some people are born naturally good learners, some become good learners by effort, and some find it hard to learn new tasks even with effort. Little is known about the neurological processes that cause someone to be a poor learner and how to improve performance in poor learners. \"Understanding brain mechanisms that lead to poor learning is important to developing effective strategies to improve memory and learning ability,\" Pahan said. The key to gaining that understanding lies in the hippocampus, a small part in the brain that generates, organizes and stores memory. Researchers have found that the hippocampus of poor learners has less CREB (a protein involved in memory and learning) and more alpha5 subunit of GABAA receptor or GABRA5 (a protein that generates tonic inhibitory conductance in the brain) than good learners. The mice in the study received oral feedings of ground cinnamon, which their bodies metabolized into sodium benzoate, a chemical used as a drug treatment for brain damage. When the sodium benzoate entered the mice's brains, it increased CREB, decreased GABRA5, and stimulated the plasticity (ability to change) of hippocampal neurons. These changes in turn led to improved memory and learning among the mice. \"We have successfully used cinnamon to reverse biochemical, cellular and anatomical changes that occur in the brains of mice with poor learning,\" Pahan said. The researchers used a Barnes maze, a standard elevated circular maze consisting of 20 holes, to identify mice with good and bad learning abilities. After two days of training, the mice were examined for their ability to find the target hole. They tested the mice again after one month of cinnamon feeding. The researchers found that after eating their cinnamon, the poor learning mice had improved memory and learning at a level found in good learning mice. However, they did not find any significant improvement among good learners by cinnamon. \"Individual difference in learning and educational performance is a global issue,\" Pahan said. \"We need to further test this approach in poor learners. If these results are replicated in poor learning students, it would be a remarkable advance.\" Cinnamon has been a sweet spot for Pahan's research. He and his colleagues previously that [cinnamon](https://www.rush.edu/news/press-releases/cinnamon-may-help-halt-parkinsons-disease-progression) can reverse changes in the brains of mice with [Parkinson's disease](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/parkinsons-disease). These studies have made the researchers spice connoisseurs: They used mass spectrometric analysis to identify the purer of the two major types of cinnamon widely available in the United States \u2014 Chinese cinnamon (Cinnamonum cassia) and original Ceylon cinnamon. \"Although both types of cinnamon are metabolized into sodium benzoate, we have seen that Ceylon cinnamon is much more pure than Chinese cinnamon, as the latter contains coumarin, a hepatotoxic (liver damaging) molecule,\" Pahan said. The study of cinnamon and learning ability was supported by grants from National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Alzheimer's Association. Interactions among researchers, clinicians and patients are critical to inspiring tomorrow's biomedical discoveries. By Mark Donahue Collaborations are critical to biomedical research. It's through a spirit of discussion and passionate focus that researchers sustain themselves in work that can take decades, through the ups and downs of sponsored funding, in the lab and sometimes far afield. Collaborative studies are on the rise in general, with partnerships at Rush alone emerging around microbiology and immunology, [Alzheimer's](https://www.rushu.rush.edu/research/departmental-research/rush-alzheimers-disease-center) and [HIV](https://www.rush.edu/services/hiv-treatment-program), and work on bone and cartilage, said Tom Wilson, assistant vice president of research affairs. And this cross-disciplinary work is drawing more attention \u2014 and support \u2014 from government and private funding agencies. \"Not too many years ago, most research faculty would kind of be in a silo,\" said Wilson. \"And they're doing what they do isolated in their laboratory, and they were getting funding for that research. But now sponsors' expectations have changed, and they want to see integrated, collaborative research projects.\" The medication Ampyra \u2014 also known by its generic name dalfampridine \u2014 was born out of a collaboration among Rush clinical and basic science researchers that started more than 30 years ago. Ampyra is used to treat [multiple sclerosis (MS)](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/multiple-sclerosis), an insidious disease that affects more than 2 million people worldwide. In MS, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks myelin in the brain and spinal cord without an identifiable cause or cure. For many sufferers, symptoms such as impaired eyesight, speech and muscle function become a fact of daily life. Ampyra is a potassium channel blocker, which enhances signaling in nerves damaged by MS, allowing patients to live more normal lives. Licensed for use in 2010, Ampyra remains the only FDA-approved therapy recognized to improve walking in MS patients. The initial spark that led to the discovery of Ampyra dates back to the 1960s, when Floyd Davis, MD, then a neurologist in training and later a physician at Rush, observed that many [multiple sclerosis](https://www.rush.edu/services/conditions/multiple-sclerosis) patients functioned better when their body temperature was slightly lowered. That raised the possibility that MS-damaged nerve fibers do not permanently lose the ability to transmit signals, as many before had thought. In 1978, Davis teamed up with another Rush clinical researcher, [Dusan Stefoski, MD](https://doctors.rush.edu/details/1587), and they concentrated on finding a compound that could mimic some of the effects of lower body temperature. Their research led them to the potassium channel blocker 4-aminopyridine, 4-AP or dalfampridine. Two years later, the team led by Davis published a paper on the scientific foundations of their work, and they began clinical trials in 1983. The results were immediate: Taken intravenously, 4-AP produced transient improvements in MS patients' motor and eyesight functions. In 1990, Rush initially licensed the proprietary know-how developed by Davis and Stefoski to a pharmaceutical company. When the company did not actively develop the drug, Rush looked for a new commercial partner. In 2003, the hospital signed a new license agreement with Acorda Therapeutics, which successfully completed the clinical development of what ultimately became Ampyra. The FDA approved Ampyra in 2010 as an extended release tablet form, followed by regulatory approvals in the European Union and Australia. From its launch until mid-2014, Rush (and its inventors) received a running royalty on sales of Ampyra. Rush sold its royalty rights to a private equity fund in August 2014 for about $42 million, and it has used large portions of the proceeds to fund other research. Today the [Rush Multiple Sclerosis Center](https://www.rush.edu/services/multiple-sclerosis-center) is continuing its work, studying whether Ampyra can help nerves restore the myelin coating stripped away by MS and if long-term use of the drug could gradually improve muscle function, much like athletic training. Bob Eisenberg, chairman emeritus of the Department of Molecular Biophysics and Physiology, has been at Rush since 1976 and recalls the excitement around the Ampyra team's initial breakthrough. One of the department's then-researchers, Charles Schauf, PhD, offered some early thoughts to Davis and Stefoski on the science behind ion channel blockade. For Eisenberg, it's a perfect example of how conversations that happen across disciplines are critical to research \u2014 in this case, the contribution of basic science to addressing foundational questions. \"There are things going on like that at the early stage right now,\" Eisenberg said. \"We don't know which one of them is going to work. We don't know where the interaction with the clinician may be helpful, here or somewhere else. It's "}
