Dellapenna is a retired professor of law who has taught at law schools in the United States and abroad for 53 years, primarily at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. He is the author of Dispelling the Myths of Abortion History (Carolina Academic Press 2006), the o nly study to combine the medical (technical), social, and legal history of abortion in England and America from the birth of the common law to create a richly textured account of abortion practice and law. Amicus has previously submitted briefs on abortion law and history to this Court in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services (1989), Hodgson v. Minnesota (1990), and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992). His interest is to bring the Court 's attention to the erroneous history on which Roe v. Wade (1973) was based, setting before the Court an accurate account of the common and statutory law relating to abortion in England and America across eight centuries, demonstrating that there is no long - term legal or social tradition of acceptance of abortion that could form the basis of a constitutional right to choose abortion. Amicus has written, either as sole author or as major contributor, The Encyclopedia of Water Law (Edward Elgar 2021), Waters and Water Rights (LexisNexis 2020), and The Evolution of the 1 The parties have consented to the filing of this brief in writing. No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in part. No person or entity other than Amic us and his counsel made a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or sub mission of this brief. 2 Law and Politics of Water (Springer 2009), as well as other books, articles, and chapters. The first edition of Suing Foreign Governments and Their Corporations (BNA 1988; 2d ed. 2003) was cited by both the majority and the dissent in Saudi Arabia v. Nelso n, 507 U.S. 349 (1993), and that book and other of his works have been widely cited in lower courts. Amicus also led the drafting of The Regulated Riparian Model Water Code (ASCE 2018), The Appropriative Rights Model Water Code (ASCE 2007), and The Berlin Rules on Water Resources (Int'l Law Ass 'n 2004). SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT The majority in Roe v. Wade ,2 influenced by deliberately distorted presentations of th e history of abortion laws that have also been pressed upon the Court in subsequent cases , erroneously concluded that abortion was not a common -law crime. Instead, the historical record shows that (a) abortion and other killings of unwanted children were condemned by all respected legal authorities in England from the start of the common law and (b) those laws were applied with full rigor in the United States during the colonial era and into the ninetee nth and twentieth centuries, including when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted . When viewed through the proper historical lens, this leg on which the Roe majority rested collapse s. Abortion was a common -law crime from the earliest recorded days, and the common law was followed and codified in the states and territories in order to 2 410 U.S. 113 (1973). 3 protect the life of the unborn child . Drawing a line at viability of the fetus has zero support in abortion history. The Court should uphold the challenge d provisions of the Mississippi statute , based on its valid and important purposes mirrored in the common law . ARGUMENT I. Through Erroneous Readings of the Historical Status of Abortion Under the Common Law, Roe Broke Sharply with the Traditional Values of the Common Law The rule of law requires judicial decisions to have a basis other than the judge 's personal predilections. This Court has found that basis in historical traditions regarding the relevant behavior.3 This Court in Roe recognized that t he historical record on abortion is highly relevant to the constitutionality of abortion laws, devoting more than half of its opinion to that topic .4 In that discussion, it recognized that abortion has always been , and now is , treated differently from other issues of reproductive privacy. 5 Thus, abortion 's historical tradition is highly relevant to determining the constitutional power of states to regulate or prohibit abortion , including prior to viability . The Roe majority , relying on tendentious articles, 3 See, e.g. , Timbs v. Ind. , 139 S. (2019) ; Harmelin v. Mich. , 501 U.S. 957, 967 -75 (1991) ; McCulloch v. Md. , 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 400 -05 (1819) . 4 410 U.S. at 129 -152, 156 -162. 5 Id. at 159. 4 concluded that \"it now appear[s] doubtful that abortion was ever . . . a common law crime \"6 and that American abortion statutes were not generally enac ted until after the Fourteenth Amendment 's adopt ion.7 Both conclusions are manifestly wrong. A careful historical review makes clear that abortion and other killings of unwanted children were always prohibited in the common law for the purpose of protecting the life of the unborn child. A. From Roe on, Courts Have Relied on a Deliberately Distorted History of Abortion The majority in Roe relied uncritically on the work of Cyril Means, Jr., who was then general counsel for the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws (NARAL ).8 Means distorted abortion precedents and statutes and ignored the larger social 6 Id. at 136. 7 Id. at 139. 8 C. Means, The Phoenix of Abortional Freedom: Is a Penumbral or Ninth -Amendment Right About to Arise from the Nineteenth -Century Legislative Ashes of a Fourteenth -Century Common -Law 17 N.Y.L.F. 335 (1971 ) (\"Means II \"); C. Means, The Law of N.Y. Concerning Abortion and the Status of the Foetus, 1664 - 1968: A Case of Cessation of Constitutionality , 14 N.Y.L.F. 411 (1968) (\"Means I \"). The majority cited Means seven times for the history of abortion, without noting that he was NARAL 's general counsel. See 410 U.S. at 122 n.21, 123 n.22, 135 n.26, 139 n.33, 148 n. 42, 151 n.47. On Mean 's relation to abortion advocacy groups, see M. Faux, Roe v. Wade : The Untold Story of the Landmark Supreme Court Decision That Made Abortion Legal 289-92, 297 -98 (1988) . 5 and technological context in which they were grounded . Abortion advocates also now rely on the work of historian James Mohr , as expressed in the \"Historians ' Briefs\" in Webster and Casey .9 These histories of abortion are advocacy pieces with a highly selective examination of the evidence to support a partisan and distorted reading . Mohr and the authors of the \"Historians ' Briefs\" present the law of abortion as a story of oppressors and oppressed, a story unsupported by the increasingly clear history of the law of abortion . Their project relies on recovering \"lost voices \"10 of mute classes who, by definition, find no or scant evidence in the historical record. This enables the advocates to discount attitudes that do appear in the historical record and that contradict their preferred theories , regarding them as aberration al, rather than representative . Recovering \"lost voices \" allows one to infer at will what the \"true\" attitudes were. Yet, if the public attitudes of formal, legal institutions did not represent the true values of society, why did those institutions express themselves in such terms, and why did those supposedly unrepresentative terms 9 J. Mohr, Abortion in America (1978) (\"Mohr\"); see also Amicus Brief of 281 American Historians, filed in Webster v. Repro. Health Servs ., 492 U.S. 490 (1989) (\"Webster Brief\"); Amicus Brief of 250 Historians, filed in Planned P'hood of Se. Pa. v. Casey , 505 U.S. 833 (1992) (\"Casey Brief\"). 10 See Casey Brief at 4. See also Law, Conversations Between Historians and the Constitution , 12 The Pub. Historian 11, 14 (1990) (\"Law\"). 6 continue despite majo r changes in social and political structures spanning more than seven centuries? The \"lost voices \" project also fails to recognize that the Constitution is a legal document. Ultimately, legal traditions must inform the Constitution ; social, medical, and mo ral contexts usefully illuminate legal traditions, but they are not an independent source of legal right s or duties . Finally, authors of the Webster Brief admitted deliberate distortions of the historical record to achieve allegedly more effective advocacy. Sylvia Law, counsel of record on the Webster Brief, candidly lamented the authors ' \"serious deficiencies as truth - tellers.\"11 James Mohr does not \"consider the brief to be history, as I understand the craft. \"12 Historian Estelle Freedman, who also worked on the brief, signed the brief despite knowing that her own research demonstrated a very different story, explaining her decision in a passage of remarkable candor : I realize that for the practical purposes of writing th is brief, it was necessary to suspend certain critiques to make common cause and to use the legal and political grounds that are available to us.13 11 Law at 14 -16. In stark contrast, one strong supporter of abortion rights has acknowledged the accuracy of Myths regarding the history of abortion laws. See Bernstein, Common Law Fundamentals of the Right to Abortion, 63 Buff. L. Rev. 1141 (2015) . 12 Mohr, Historically Based Legal Briefs: Observations of a Participant in the Webster Process, 12 The Pub. Historian 19, 25 (1990) . 13 Freedman, Historical Interpretation and Legal 7 The difficulties these admissions present are not resolved simply by asserting, as do the other two lawyers on the Webster Brief , that all discourse is necessarily political and that any distinction between scholarship and distorti on is illusory.14 The Casey Brief was written by the same attorneys , relying on the same historians , with only small changes of emphasis. The se briefs attempted to buttress the twin claims on which the Roe majority hinged its opinion: that abortion (1) has always been a common social practice and (2) was a common -law liberty before the Civil War . Both of these claims we re demonstrably false when Roe was written, and furth er scholarship has continued to undercut those claims .15 B. From the Beginning of the Common Law, Courts and Other Respected Authorities Consistently Condemned Abortion Despite the relative unpopularity of abortion techniques to rid oneself of an unwanted child due to the serious risks of abortion treatments to the Advocacy: Rethinking the Webster Amicus Brief , 12 The Pub. Historian 27, 32 (1990) . 14 Larson & Spillenger, \"That 's Not History \": The Boundaries of Advocacy and Scholarship , 12 The Pub. Historian 33 (1990) . 15 Certain historians continue to support Roe's historically inaccurate co nclusions with retellings of the \"new orthodox \" history of abortion. See, e.g. , Mary Ziegler, Abortion and the Law in America: Roe v . Wade to the Present (2020); Mary Ziegler, After Roe, The Lost Years of the Abortion Debate (2015). In neither work does she cite to or comment on Professor Dellapenna 's scholarship that forms the basis for this brief. 8 mother, c ommon -law indictments and appeals of felony for abortion are recorded as early as 1200 .16 While the terse records often do not indicate the outcome of the proceedings,17 the many records indicating punishment18 and judgments of \"not guilty\" rather than dismissal19 prove that the indictments and appeals were valid under the common law. Means was simply wrong to assert that only two cases dealt with abortion before 1600 and that the courts in both cases doubted whether abortion was a crime . In the first case he cited, the 1327 case of Rex v. de Bourton ,20 Means (and the Roe majority21) relied on a faulty text , and even the faulty text did not support Means ' highly partisan analysis. Bourton was charged with beating a woman, causing one 16 Joseph W. Dellapenna, The Myths of Abortion History 127-84 (2006) (\"Myths \"); see generally J. Keown, Abortion, Doctors and the Law (1988) . 17 See, e.g., Sibil 's Appeal (1203), 1 Selden Soc'y 32 (no. 73) (1887) ; Agnes 's Appeal (1200), id. at 39 (no. 82) . Many more cases between 1200 and 1600 are summarized and analyzed in Myths at 129 -84). 18 See, e.g., cases collected and discussed including decrees of death, imprisonment, and outlawry in Myths at 134 -43. See also Leges Henri Primi ch. LXX.14 (L.J. Downer ed. 1972) (a 12 th-century compilation of Anglo - Saxon law as modified by the early Norman kings). 19 See Myths at 137 n.86 (collecting over 30 cases) . 20 Y.B. Mich. 1 Edw. 3, f. 23, pl. 28 (K.B. 1327). 21 Justice Blackmun did not refer to the two cases by name, but he did reference Professor Means ' use of them to discredit Edward Coke 's statement about the criminality of abortion in the seventeenth century. Roe, 410 U.S. at 135 n.26. 9 twin to be born dead and the other to die shortly after birth , and he apparently was released on bail to answer for a different charge. The full record reveals the case actually to have been a dispute over whether the offense was bailable, and not over its crim inality. In the end, the charges were not dismissed , but he was pardoned , which also demonstrates that abortion was a criminal offense .22 In the 1348 case of Rex v. Anonymous ,23 the second case Means cited, the defendant escaped conviction for killing a child in the mother 's womb for the dubious reason that the indictment failed to state a baptismal name for the vic tim24 and because it was impossible to know if the defendant had killed the child. In both Bourton and Anonymous , the issues were procedural and evidentiary, not substantive. Bracton, writing in the thirteenth century, also declared abortion (if the child were \"formed or animated \") to be criminal homicide .25 Cases in the sixteenth century clearly held abortions to be crimes. A coroner 's inquest held 22 See Myths at 143 -50 for a full discussion. 23 (K.B. 1348), Fitzherbert, Graunde Abridgement, tit. ed. 1516). 24 \"Murder, \" at least until 1340, meant a fine imposed on a defendant when no one could prove a deceased 's identity as an Englishman. 1 W. Holdsworth, A History of English Law 65-77, 580 -632 (1938) . This usage was still common in the Inns of Courts nearly two centuries later.

Sixteenth -century legal activity directed at abortion involve d the secularization of ecclesiastical 26 R. v. Lichefeld , K.B. Cockaine v. Witnam (1577), Cro. Eliz. 49 (1586) ; see (Essex 1581) .

Sims35 held an abortion in which a child die d after its live birth to be murder on grounds that the birth and subsequent death of the child allow ed proof of the cause of death. In 1602, in R. v. Webb ,36 a woman apparently was saved from punishment for self - abortion only by a general pardon. And Sir Matthew Hale held that the death of a mother from an abortion was a felony homicide.37 Courts in many other seventeenth -century cases treat ed abortion as 32 Before the Bawdy Court 81, 152, 172, 204, 238 (nos. 150, 369, 427, 531) (P.

Sims as Attorney - General and discussed the case in his Third Institute ,39 generalizing from it a principle that abortion after quickening was \"a great misprision [serious misdemeanor], and no murder \" if the child died in the womb, but murder if the child died after its birth. Coke 's proposition for some time was accepted virtually without question.40 Coke did not cite available precedents for his conclusions ,41 but the key point here is that he identified abortion as a common -law crime. Means dismissed Coke's statement as a \"masterpiece of perversion ,\"42 but h e did not grapple with the mountain of evidence that supported Coke 's conclusion . 38 See, e.g., Myths at 194 nn.84 -86 (collecting cases). 39 3 E.

Hale 's opinion cannot now be established with certainty, but, as noted, he concluded that abortion was a felony sufficient to justify application of the felony murder rule.

English Law Always Prohibited Parents from Killing Unwanted Children, and Parliament and the Courts Took Strong Steps, Gradually Strengthened over Centuries, to Punish Such Ac ts Most abortion cases before 1700 involved crude physical batterings of the mother , often to her serious injury or death (injury techniques).43 The remaining abortions were induced by \"noxious potions\" that were nearly as deadly as the batterings (ingestion techniques).44 Such i ngestion and injury techniques could be effective only with intense pain and a risk of death or permanent injury. Voluntary abortions were rare when the techniques available were often tantamount to suicide.45 43 Injury techniques ranged from ineffective, simple body maneuvers to savage assaults, such as cutting the mother and removing the infant. See Myths at 32 -36. 44 Id. at 37 -52. Appeals or indictments for abortion by potion were rarer than for abortion by assault because potions seen as part of magic rituals were punishable as witchcraft, but only by an ecclesiastical court before Elizabeth I. 45 Shorter concluded that, before 1880, only the truly desperate would risk abortion.

And, while we cannot know all potions available in medieval England, surveys of the medical literature there and in medically similar societies show that the potions ingested for an a bortion were either ineffective or highly dangerous.46 For example, savin (juniper) , the abortifacient most widely reported in medieval English sources , works by undermining the woman 's health generally so she cannot sustain the pregnancy, all too often enfeebling her to the point of death.47 The Roe majority accepted the assertion of some historians that abortion was available through other, safer methods.48 Representative of them is John Riddle , who attempted to prove this supposition in his 1992 work ,49 claim ing that doctors and midwives during Roman and medieval times knew and used many safe and effective means to procure abortion s. To do so , Riddle employed a pharmacologist who recently\u2014no earlier than the late nineteenth century \u2014 abortion was simply too dangerous for a rational actor to choose for herself \"). 46 Id. at 37 -51; see J.

Indeed, n ineteenth - century courts were well aware of the dangers these 50 See Gina Kolata, In Ancient Times, Flowers and Fennel for Family Planning, N.Y.

If so, w hy would such folk medicines abruptly disappear in the nineteenth century in favor of highly dangerous intrusion techniques ? The answer is that this belief is a fable.57 Before the nineteenth century , the usual ways to rid oneself of an unwanted child were infanticide and abandonment (which often amounted to the same thing) .58 Infanticide was a frequent crime when abortion was still rare.59 Royal courts actively punished those convicted of infanticide and denied benefit of clergy to those accused of the crime.60 The earliest known 56 See, e.g., Cmwlth. v. W.M.W. , 3 Pitt. Rep. 462 (1871) ; Moore v. , 49 S.W. 287 (Tex. Crim. 1897) . 57Bernstein remarked, \"Speaking for myself, I acknowledge having trouble letting go of the belief that in days of old, persons seeking to end pregnancy received efficacious therapies from an unlettered yet sage female network. . . . Yet there is little reason to think that abort ion was until modern times an option for someone who intended to survive the experience. \" 63 Buffalo L.

Hull, Murdering Mothers: Infanticide in England and New England 1558 -1803 (1981) (\"Hoffer & Hull \"). 60 See, e.g. , R. v. Parker , 73 Eng. Rep. 410 (1580) . 17 regulations of midwives , published in 1512 , were adopted to prevent the killing of infants.61 Parliament enacted ev er more stringent statutes prohibiting infanticide, culminating in \"An Act to Prevent the Destroying and Murdering of Bastard Children ,\" legislation that conclusively presumed murder from concealment of the death of a child in order to hide its birth.62 Only the emergence of abortion as a real alternative to infanticide reduced the incidence of infanticide, making it a lesser legal problem. Th e intimate relationship between abortion and infanticide was demonstrated by Lord Ellenborough 's Act , the first English statutory prohibition of abortion , which in its very next section lessened the penalty for concealment of the death of a newborn ,63 making explicit the link between abortion and infanticide and recognizing their shifting rates by giving abortion primacy . D. The American Colonies Applied Laws Against Abortion Rigorously The English colonists brought the common law of abortion with them. In just one colony, Maryland, three prosecutions for criminal abortion arose before 61 J. Donnison, Midwives and Medical Men 18-20 (1988) . These regulations were repeatedly strengthened. T. Forbes, The Midwife and the Witch 144-147 (1966) . Wet - nurses were also seen as a major population control device, J.

The third was convicted of attempted murder, apparently because of a failure to prove the cause of death for the stillborn child. Prosecutions for abortion also arose in other colonies. A Rhode Island woman received 15 lashes for fornication and attempted abortion.65 Indictments also survive from Delaware66 and Virginia.67 And a 1716 New York municipal ordin ance forbade midwives to aid or counsel abortion.68 While abortion and infanticide do not seem to 64 Proprietary v.

Massengill, A Sketch of Medicine and Pharma cy 294 (2d ed. 1942) . 19 have been common in colonial America,69 more colonial legal activity, just as in England, was directed against infanticide than abortion.70 Still, one of the few secondary sources of the period concluded that the common law prohibiting abortion was part of New York law.71 E. When Abortion Became More Common Than Infanticide with the Development of Technical Means with a Lessened Danger to the Mother 's Life, English and American Law Came to Emphasize Abortion as the Primary Evil Endangering Unwanted Child ren Abortion statutes were enacted throughout the nation and the world in the nineteenth century.72 Roe's majority viewed this, and the accompanying increase in prosecutions, as resulting from Victorian sexual attitudes, fears for maternal health, and 69 J.

Concealment statutes were enacted in eight colonies or states before an abortion statute. Eleven states enacted a con cealment statute contemporaneously with the state 's first abortion statute and 20 states codified the two statutes together.

II) , 49 Geo. L.J. 395 (1961) . 20 concern for fetal life.73 Means insisted that only fear for maternal health motivated the legislation .74 But neithe r explained why these reasons became weighty only in the nineteenth century. Mohr and his associates, while recognizing a \"moral prejudice \" favoring the life of unborn children,75 argued that the central reason for the statutes was to ensure the domin ance of the newly organized allopathic physicians over competitors, especially midwives, and to a lesser degree to reverse falling birthrates among the native -born middle classes and to ensure paternal dominance in the household.76 These reasons, they asser ted, were sufficient, without concern over fetal life, to overcome allegedly strong public s upport , among men as well as women , for the free availability of abortions.77 The actual reasons are quite different and rooted in technological change. The first report of an intrusion technique in England was in a case in 1732 .78 A woman was sentenced to the pillory and to 73 410 U.S. at 147 -52. 74 Means I at 511 -15; Means II at 382 -92. 75 Mohr at 35 -36, 87, 104, 110 -11, 140, 143 -44, 147 -59, 164-70, 196 -99, 207, 214, 216 -17, 261 -63; Casey Brief at 11, 15, 26 -28; Webster Brief at 11, 16, 25 -28. 76 Mohr at 32 -37, 86 -122, 128 -31, 134 -35, 147 -82, 166 -70, 187-90, 202, 204, 207 -16, 226 -29, 237 -40, 256 -60; Casey Brief at 13 -21; Webster Brief at 13 -21. Mohr discounted concern for maternal health because he believ ed that abortion was safe. Mohr at 25 -40. 77 See, e.g. , Mohr at 108 -10, 115 -18; Casey Brief at 22 -23. 78 The earliest description of an intrusion procedure anywhere was in Diderot 's Encyclopedie (at 452 (1766) ), which described an experiment in 1714. Shorter , at 188 - 208, places the invention of effective intrusion techniques 21 three years in prison for inserting an iron rod into a second woman 's womb, inducing an abortion at less than 14 weeks of gestation (well before viability and quickening).79 Similar prosecutions arose in 1781 and 1803.80 Abortion by intrusion remained highly dangerous; the inserted object served as a highway for infection, and the procedure often was sufficiently painful to induce life -threatening shock.81 Death was not as certain, however, as with injury and ingestion techniques. Intrusion quickly became the technique of choice. Lord Ellenborough himself spoke to the sudden upsurge in abortions in the preamble to the eponym ous a ct: It . . . .\"82 The drafters of the first Pennsylvania abortion statute made a similar observation.83 The Maryland Court of Appeals made the point even more directly in the 1901 decision of Worthington v. State : late in the 19th century. 79 R. v. Bear e, 2 The Gentleman 's Mag. 931 (Aug. 1732) . 80 R. v. Anonymous , 3 J. Chitty, Criminal Law 798-801 (1816) ; R. v. Tinckler (1781), 1 E. East, Pleas of the Crown 354-356 (1806). 81 J. Bates & E. Zawadski, Criminal Abortion 85-87 (1964) . Apparently, abortions killed about one -third of the women undergoing them early in the 19th century. See Myths at 308 -09; see also O.W. Bartley, A Treatise on Forensic Med. 3, 5 (1815) ; T.R. Beck & J. Beck, Elements of Med. Jurisprudence 276-77 (1823) ; J. Burns, The Anatomy of the Gravid Uterus 57-58 (1799 ); G. Male, An Epitome of Judicial or Forensic Med. 116-117 (1816) . 82 43 Geo. III, ch. 58. 83 Pa. Daily Legis. Rec . No. 19, at 151 (1860) . 22 It is common knowledge that death is not now the usual, nor, indeed, the always probable, consequence of an abortion. The death of the mother, doubtless, more frequently resulted in the days of rude surgery, when the character and properties of powerful drugs were but little known, a nd the control over their application more limited. But, in these days of advanced surgery and marvelous medical science and skill, operations are performed and powerful drugs administered by skillful and careful men without danger to the life of the patie nt. Indeed, it is this comparative immunity from danger to the woman which has doubtless led to great increase of the crime, to the establishment of a class of educated professional abortionists, and to the enactment of the severe statutes almost everywher e . . . .84 Abortion prohibitions almost invariably were enacted in a general codification of common -law crimes ,85 suggest ing that the statutes were not thought to change the law , but to affirm it . Moreover, all nineteenth -century surgery was dangerous for the same reasons as beset intrusi on abortions (infection and shock), yet only for abortion were social or other pressures likely to induce some one to undergo the procedure despite risk to life or limb, indicating that intrusi on abortions were just as criminal as either 84 48 A. 355, 356 -57 (Md. 1901). 85 Lord Ellenborough 's Act, officially the \"Offenses Against the Person Act, \" was the first comprehensive criminal statute in English law. 23 injury or ingestion abortions and that abortions were criminal regardless of the stage of pregnancy. As further discussed in part II infra, the statutes solemnly reaffirm ed the criminali ty of abortion in the face of technological innovations that made it safer to perform .86 F. The Prohibitions of Abortion Represented a Widely Shared Consensus on the Value of Fetal Life, a Consensus that Included Nineteenth -Century Feminists and , Thus, Cannot Properly Be Characterized as a Conspiracy by Male Physicians and Others to Suppress Women The nineteenth century saw a steady broadening of abortion statutes to reach all abortions , regardless of the technique used or the stage of pregnancy , with a number of states includ ing punishment for the mother.87 This broadening 86 Nineteenth -century cases split over whether pre - quickening abortion was a common -law crime. Compare , e.g., Mills v. Cmwlth. , 13 Pa. 631 (1850) (yes), with Smith v. State , 33 Me. 48, 57 (1851) (no). Two leading early treatises on American criminal law both concluded that it was. 1 J.P. Bishop, Criminal Law \u00a7 386 (2d ed. 1858) ; 1 F. Wharton, The Criminal Law of the United States \u00a7\u00a7 1220 - 1230 (5th rev. ed. 1861) . 87 The broadening is illustrated by the New York abortion statutes. In 1845, New York made it a misdemeanor for a woman to seek or procure an abortion, raising it to a felony in 1872. See generally Myths at 328. Both \"Historians ' Briefs\" flatly (and falsely) assert that women were never subject to punishment for abortion. Casey Brief at 1; Webster Brief at 1. 24 suggests, as contemporary courts generally held, that protection of fetal life was the major purpose of the statutes.88 Many religious and social leaders also supported treating a bortion as a crime.89 Only by impugning the integrity of innumerable social and professional leaders can one argue that protection of unborn children from abortion was not a significant concern. Historians favoring abortion rights would have us believe that nineteenth -century abortion statutes were adopted as instances of male oppressors subjugating oppressed females, with doctors usurping the market for midwives and husbands dominating their wives in their home life.90 This fanciful history is refuted by the stance of nineteenth -century feminists ; even the most militant and well -known, including Susan B. Anthony and 88 See, e.g. , Dougherty v. People , 1 Colo. 514 (1872) ; State v. Lee , 37 A. 75 (Conn. 1897) ; State v. Moore , 52 Iowa 128 (1868) ; State v. Watson , 1 P. 770 (Kan. 1883) ; Smith v.

Howard , 32 Vt. 380 (1859) . 89 See Resolution of the Medical Society of the State of New York, 1867 N.Y. Assembly J. 443 -44 (Feb. 28, 1867) (\"Resolution \"). The Roe majority quoted other representative statements, 410 U.S. at 141 -42. See also M. Olasky, The Press and Abortion, 1838 -1988 17-53 (1988) (\"Olasky\"). 90 Cf. Gonzales v. Carhart , 550 U.S. 124, 171 -72 (2007) (Ginsberg, J., dissenting) (describing abortion as needed to allow women to be free from pregnancy to be able to realize their equal potential with men in the marketplace). 25 Elizabeth Cady Stanton, were adamantly opposed to legal abortion .91 This attitude continued among feminists into the twentieth century, with Margaret Sanger initially advancing her abhorrence of abortion as a major reason for founding what was to become Planned Parenthood Federation.92 Feminist abhorrence of abortion arose because the feminists viewed abort ion as the killing of a child. Indeed, Stanton entitled her article published contemporaneously with the adoption of the Fourteen Amendment, \"Child Murder. \"93 In contrast to their antipathy to abortion , the nineteenth - century feminists supported legal access to contracep tion because it did not involv e the killing of a child .94 Even where contraception was illegal, the penalties for abortion were harsher, again recognizing th e basic difference.95 As the story of the early feminists demonstrates , nineteenth -century legislatures responded to a widely shared consensus that abortion was the taking of human life and , thus, far different from contraception. This history provides no support whatsoever to the manufactured claims of advocacy pieces such as the Means articles 91 See, e.g. , E. Duffy, The Relations of the Sexes 274-75 (1876) ; A. Stockham, Tokology 246-50 (1887) ; Susan B. Anthony, Marriage and Maternity , 4 The Revolution 4 (July 8, 1869) ; Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Child Murder , 1 The Revolution 146 -47 (Mar. 12, 1868) .

II. Contrary to Roe, the English and American Legal Understanding Before Adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment Was That Abortion Killed a Child at Any Stage of Fetal Development , an Understanding Expressed in Case Law and Statutes The claim in Roe that American abortion statutes were not generally enacted until after the Fourteenth Amendment 's adoption is inaccurate.96 That a unique human life begins at conception was established scientifically by the early 1800 's.97 An English court promptly interpreted the earlier statutory term \"quick with child \" to mean conception, rather than the felt movement of the child within the womb, returning to the original understanding of that term.98 96 Compare 410 U.S. at 138 -39 with Myths at 315 -19. Justice Rehnquist, in his dissent to Roe, listed 36 state or territorial statutes prohibiting abortion in 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. 410 U.S. at 175. 97 See Myths at 259. 98 R. v. Wycherley , 173 Eng. Rep. 486 (N.P. 1838) ; see also The Offenses Against the Persons Act, 7 Will. IV & 1 Vict., ch. 85 (1837) . That there was some conf usion over this term historically is not surprising. The standard phrase down through the centuries was \"quick with child,\" which refers not to quickening as felt in the womb but to alive as opposed to dead, as in the phrase \"the quick and the dead, \" a phr ase that has nothing to do with a stage of gestation and applies to adults as well as children, as recognized Wycherley. Mr. Philip Rafferty 's research persuaded the Oxford English Dictionary to 27 After these scientific developments in the early 1800's, many states revised their abortion statute s to clarify that, a t whatever stage of pregnancy, whether before or after quickening, abortion was a crime that involved the taking of a human life.99 The Amer ican Medical Association unanimously adopted in 1859 a committee report that called for protection of fetal life beca use of the \"independent and actual existence of the child before birth, as a living being. \"100 Similarly, the Medical Society of New York in 1867 \"condemned abortion at every stage of gestation as 'murder.'\"101 All of t his was well known when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868.102 American jurisdictions followed suit , both in statutes and decisional law. The nineteenth -century evolution of the statutes underlined that they were crafted to protect human life. By 190 0 all states and territories uniformly made abortion a serious crime (except to save the life of the mother ).103 The large majority of the statutes referred to the fetus as a child . The statu tes of 30 states did so by 1868 , as well as those of seven territories and one nation (all of which later became states). Th at of Connecticut is change its definition of \"quick with child \" to conform to the Wycherley definition. See 23 Nov. 1990 ltr. from J.A. Simpson, coeditor of OED, to Rafferty (copy in Dellapenna 's possession). The phrase apparently became confused with the phrase \"with quick child. \" But see State v. Cooper , 22 N.J.L. 53, 57 (1849). 99 Myths at 234 -55, 260, 268, 282. 100 12 Transactions of the AMA 75 -76 (1859) . 101 Resolution ; see Myths at 46. 102 See, e.g., C.

[pay a fine up to $1,000 and suffer imprisonment of one to five years].104 The Pennsylvania Supreme Court in 1850 held that the common law supported an action for abortion at any stage of gestation: \"the moment the womb is instinct with embryo life, and gestation has begun, the crime may be perpetrated. \"105 The st ate legislat ure in 1860 followed this lead , statutorily criminalizing abortion of \"any woman, pregnant or quick with child .\"106 Some states , as illustrated above , removed any ambiguity regarding quickening by defining an unlawful abortion as involving a 104 Conn.

The history of abortion law provided no support for Roe's finding of a fundamental right for a mother to abort her fetus prior to viability (and thereafter if her \"health\" were implicated). The genius of the common law accommodates underlying principles to changing cir cumstances and knowledge. For abortion, the underlying principle of the common law was that a gestating, living fetus was entitled to protection from being killed by an abortion. The common law recognized growing scientific knowledge and did away with confused earlier precedent s that some read as suggesting that a fetus was only alive after being felt by the mother in 107 See Tenn. Acts, ch. CXL, \u00a7 1, at 188 -89 (1883) ; Vt. Acts, no. 33, \u00a7 1 (1846) . 108 Wyo. (Terr.) Laws, 3, 25, at 104 (1869) . 109 Tex. Gen . Stat. Dig., ch. VII, art. 535, at 524 (Oldham & White 1859) . 30 the womb. Statutory law in the states and territories codified this scientifically informed understanding , consistent ly with the principal purpose of the common law , by protect ing innocent life of unborn children from conception . CONCLUSION The historical predicates on which Roe was based are incorrect . The common law always made abortion illegal, and the main motivation was protection of the lives of unborn child ren, from the earliest moment of their life in the womb. By the early nineteenth century , medical science had firmly established that a unique human life begins upon conception. With that knowledge, courts and legislators in England and America confirmed that abortion prohibitions applied uniformly during a woman's entire pregnancy, largely eliminating difference s in penalt ies before and after quickening . The common law never made viability a touchstone for the severity of its penalization of abortion. Indeed, viability occurs later than when a child is normally felt to move in the womb by its mother. Roe should be overruled , with the Court adopting an accurate statement of the common law and the history of abortion . With that established, the viability distinction of Roe should be abandoned and the Mississippi statute should be upheld . 31 Respectfully submitted this 29th day of July, 2021 , /s/ Frederick W.
