Specific symptoms improve as the strengthened body defenses become more active. During homeopathic care, remedies are given to stimulate the process by which the person heals himself or herself in a safe, gentle, and reliable way. A homeopath views health as a condition of the entire individual rather than in terms of isolated symptoms from specific parts of the body. The focus is on your unique set of symptoms occurring mentally, emotionally, and physically. In this way treatment is individualized based on the totality of symptoms. Since homeopathy is focused on treating the whole person, anyone can benefit from homeopathic care regardless of symptoms or diagnosis. What Is Homeopathy? Homeopathy is a process for the restoration of your whole, healthy self. Through homeopathy, you are partaking on a healing journey towards a fully functioning, optimal state of health. Homeopathic remedies are derived mostly from plants and simple minerals and are FDA-approved. They are uniquely prepared through a dilution and shaking process. This differentiates them from common herbs or natural supplements. As such, they are also non-toxic, non-habit forming, and have no side effects. They also do not interfere with current medications you may be taking. In fact, over time homeopathy can help alleviate dependence on medications and bring you greater vitality and long-term health.
