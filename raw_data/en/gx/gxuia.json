There are meditation cushions, a meditation bench, and a chair available for your use. You are also welcome to bring your own meditation cushion, pillow, etc. You are welcome to meditate, journal, or use the space for another quiet activity! You do not need to be a current or past patient to use the space - everyone is welcome! Guidelines for the space: Please be quiet entering and using the space. Step outside the clinic if you need to take a phone call, do not play music on speaker, etc. - the clinic is open during these hours, so please be respectful of patients' healing space. Take your shoes off prior to stepping on the carpet. This helps keep the meditation area clean! Please do not take open drink containers or food onto the carpet. This also helps keep the space clean for others. Closed water bottles are okay! You do not need to sign up for a time, but please be aware that you could be sharing the space with others. This means access to supplies could be limited! Please bring headphones, earplugs, or other sound-dampening tools if they are necessary for you; the clinic is generally open during these hours and you may hear background noise (including conversation).
