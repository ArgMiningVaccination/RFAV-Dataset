However, although vaccinations provide good protection, they do not offer full immunity and while they likely reduce transmission of the virus to others, the extent of this remains uncertain. This produces a dilemma for communicators who wish to be transparent about benefits and harms and encourage continued caution in vaccinated individuals but not undermine confidence in an important public health measure. In two large pre-registered experimental studies on quota-sampled UK public participants we investigate the effects of providing transparent communication\u2014including uncertainty\u2014about vaccination effectiveness on decision-making. In Study 1 (n = 2097) we report that detailed information about COVID-19 vaccines, including results of clinical trials, does not have a significant impact on beliefs about the efficacy of such vaccines, concerns over side effects, or intentions to receive a vaccine. Study 2 (n = 2217) addressed concerns that highlighting the need to maintain protective behaviours (e.g., social distancing) post-vaccination may lower perceptions of vaccine efficacy and willingness to receive a vaccine. We do not find evidence of this: transparent messages did not significantly reduce perceptions of vaccine efficacy, and in some cases increased perceptions of efficacy. We again report no main effect of messages on intentions to receive a vaccine. The results of both studies suggest that transparently informing people of the limitations of vaccinations does not reduce intentions to be vaccinated but neither does it increase intentions to engage in protective behaviours post-vaccination.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-04-13", "cleaned_text": "Effect of Information about COVID-19 Vaccine Effectiveness and Side Effects on Behavioural Intentions: Two Online Experiments [https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9040379](https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9040379) [Psychological Aspects of wide-ranging restrictions have been placed on people across the globe, with immense social and economic consequences [ [2](#B2-vaccines-09-00379), [3](#B3-vaccines-09-00379)]. Mass vaccination has been heralded as a \"checkmate\" move to end the pandemic [ [4](#B4-vaccines-09-00379)]. However for lasting and widespread protection, this relies firstly on vaccines being developed that significantly reduce transmission of the disease rather than simple individual protection, and secondly, sufficient uptake of the vaccine to produce 'herd immunity'\u2014a level of population immunity at which an infectious agent is no longer able to spread [ [5](#B5-vaccines-09-00379)]. Estimates of the percentage of the population required to be vaccinated to achieve this goal vary (and depend on the local reproduction rate, R, of the virus), with most estimates in the 60-80% range [ [6](#B6-vaccines-09-00379), [7](#B7-vaccines-09-00379)]. [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00379)]\u2014defined as \"delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite availability of vaccination services.\" [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00379)]. Factors such as religion, gender, political ideology, and trust in medical and scientific institutions have been shown to be associated with vaccine hesitancy, both in general and regarding COVID-19 vaccines specifically [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00379), [10](#B10-vaccines-09-00379), [11](#B11-vaccines-09-00379)]. While these broader factors are important, research has also shown that specific beliefs about and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccinations are also closely linked to vaccination intentions [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00379), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00379)]. Whether these attitudes can be, and should be, changed by communication 'campaigns' is a matter of active debate worldwide. 1.1. Transparent Communication of Vaccine Risks and Benefits [13](#B13-vaccines-09-00379), [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00379), [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00379)]. Some, for example, Rzymski et al. [ [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00379)], think that such information may change individuals' vaccine beliefs: \"The general public must be given access to the pivotal information on the authorized vaccines, and that their approval is based on the evidenced benefits that outweigh the potential risks of vaccine administration\" (p. 3). Others see such transparency as more a matter of ensuring public trust in science, or simply an ethical imperative [ [17](#B17-vaccines-09-00379)]. Such calls demand empirical evidence of their potential effects, and hence are the impetus for the current study. What are the effects of such communications on individuals' beliefs about COVID-19 and their intentions to receive a vaccine? We note three important considerations in approaching this question. [18](#B18-vaccines-09-00379)] with well-defined (if small) risks to the individual. As such, in some countries it is treated as an individual medical decision and requires informed consent (in others it is treated as a public health policy and can be mandated without the option of consent or refusal\u2014for some discussion see [ [19](#B19-vaccines-09-00379), [20](#B20-vaccines-09-00379), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00379), [22](#B22-vaccines-09-00379)]). In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, until recently there was no evidence that they reduced transmission of the disease to others and therefore were more accurately considered a method of individual rather than public protection. Many might argue, therefore, that clearly and transparently communicating what is currently known about COVID-19 vaccines should be considered important from an ethical [ [23](#B23-vaccines-09-00379)] (and potential legal [ [24](#B24-vaccines-09-00379)]) standpoint, regardless of any expected effect of such messages on individuals' vaccination intentions. [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00379)]. On the other, as noted by Petersen et al. [ [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00379)], it is also possible that individuals may find the information more concerning, increasing their perception of vaccines as relatively more dangerous or ineffective. That is, some people may find the reported frequency of COVID-19 vaccine side effects to be higher, or efficacy of vaccines to be lower than they expected. Indeed, some (pre-COVID) vaccination messaging studies have reported 'backfire' effects, such that well-meaning efforts to increase vaccination intentions actually increase safety concerns and lower vaccination intentions [ [26](#B26-vaccines-09-00379)]. [27](#B27-vaccines-09-00379)]. In the context of vaccination attitudes, Kitta and Goldberg [ [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00379)] position the deficit model as \"...the presumption that vaccination opposition and/or refusals are primarily driven by insufficient understanding of the facts regarding vaccination risks and benefits.\" (p. 2). Within science and health communication fields the deficit model approach has received widespread criticism as ignoring the myriad social, cultural and psychological factors that drive risk perceptions and attitudes toward medical and scientific issues and technologies [ [28](#B28-vaccines-09-00379)]. However, COVID-19 vaccines are a very new medical intervention and a lack of information may play a greater role in attitudes and intentions compared to resistance towards other, more established vaccines. This point is explicitly noted by Opel et al. [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00379)] in comparing general vaccine hesitancy to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. They write: \"The former is steeped in a complex sociocultural milieu of consumerism, pervasive misinformation, and the rejection of objective, scientific evidence as truth. The latter may simply represent a deficit of the data needed to make an informed decision.\" (p. 1) 1.2. Beliefs about COVID Vaccines and Vaccine Hesitancy [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00379), [30](#B30-vaccines-09-00379), [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00379), [32](#B32-vaccines-09-00379), [33](#B33-vaccines-09-00379), [34](#B34-vaccines-09-00379), [35](#B35-vaccines-09-00379)]). Indeed, a recent systematic review of such studies [ [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00379)] concludes that perceptions of vaccine safety and effectiveness are 'universally' consistent determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (p. 8). Further, surveys which specifically asked COVID-19 vaccine hesitant participants their reason for vaccine refusal or delay consistently report that concerns over safety and efficacy are among the most common reasons given [ [33](#B33-vaccines-09-00379), [36](#B36-vaccines-09-00379), [37](#B37-vaccines-09-00379), [38](#B38-vaccines-09-00379), [39](#B39-vaccines-09-00379), [40](#B40-vaccines-09-00379)]. Similarly, qualitative research has also highlighted these concerns as reported drivers of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among minority and at-risk groups [ [41](#B41-vaccines-09-00379), [42](#B42-vaccines-09-00379), [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00379)]. Such concerns may be fuelled by COVID-19 vaccine misinformation [ [44](#B44-vaccines-09-00379)] and recent research has identified susceptibility to misinformation as a correlate of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy [ [45](#B45-vaccines-09-00379)]. [46](#B46-vaccines-09-00379), [47](#B47-vaccines-09-00379)]. The Health Belief Model has informed previous vaccine communication research. For example, Jones et al. [ [48](#B48-vaccines-09-00379)] show that exposure to vaccination campaign advertisements is associated with increased willingness to receive a H1N1 vaccine, and that this effect is partially mediated by belief that the vaccine will prevent disease and belief that the vaccine would not have a negative impact on one's health. The authors conclude that addressing perceived barriers (e.g., perceptions of vaccine risk) may be the most effective target for interventions to improve vaccine uptake. 1.3. The Effect of COVID-19 Vaccine Communications on Intentions [49](#B49-vaccines-09-00379), [50](#B50-vaccines-09-00379), [51](#B51-vaccines-09-00379), [52](#B52-vaccines-09-00379), [53](#B53-vaccines-09-00379)]. However, experimental studies which have examined the impact of COVID-19 vaccine information on behavioural intentions report mixed results. For example Petersen et al. [ [25](#B25-vaccines-09-00379)] report that transparent positive messages heralding a safe and effective fictional COVID-19 vaccine (70% efficacy with a 1 in 10,000 incidence of serious side effects) decreased vaccine scepticism relative to vague or negative transparent messages. However, no control group was included in the study\u2014leaving it unclear which interventions shifted beliefs relative to a baseline. In another messaging experiment, Motta et al. [ [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00379)] report that messages framed to emphasise the collective benefits of vaccination or the risks of not vaccinating increased participants' vaccine intentions\u2014however the presence or absence of information about the rigorousness of clinical trials had no impact on intentions. Palm et al. [ [55](#B55-vaccines-09-00379)] find that messages highlighting vaccine efficacy and safety had a marginally significant effect on vaccine intentions relative to a control group, while an opposite message claiming planned vaccines were neither effective nor safe had no main effect on intentions. Conversely, in a pre-post design experiment Loomba et al. [ [56](#B56-vaccines-09-00379)] report that exposure to a range of factual information about potential COVID-19 vaccines has no effect on vaccine intentions, while COVID-19 vaccine misinformation decreases vaccination intentions. Duquette [ [57](#B57-vaccines-09-00379)] reports that short messages framing vaccination as protecting either oneself or others have no effect on reported vaccination intentions (but notes that there are some experimental effects among non-white participants). [58](#B58-vaccines-09-00379)] paid French participants to spend 10 min interacting with an extensive Q&A interface in which users could select questions and read answers (the complete Q&A comprised more than 20 pages of text). Some of the answers included preliminary results from clinical trials outlining vaccine efficacy (95% for Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, and <70% for AstraZeneca) and noted some side effects without giving any indication of frequency. Altay et al. report that participants who interacted with the Q&A were more likely to report intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when available and expressed more positive attitudes towards vaccines, compared to a control group. However, it is unknown how many participants actually accessed or read the information on vaccine safety and efficacy. [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00379)]). We also include two further exploratory messages as experimental conditions. The first focuses on addressing concerns over the speed of vaccine development and approval, which is also associated with vaccine hesitancy [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00379)] and the second presents a mechanistic description of how vaccines, including the new mRNA vaccines, work. Mechanistic explanations have been shown to reduce risk perceptions and shift attitudes in other scientific domains [ [59](#B59-vaccines-09-00379), [60](#B60-vaccines-09-00379)]. 1.4. Post-Vaccination Protective Behaviour Messaging and Vaccine Confidence [61](#B61-vaccines-09-00379)]), there is considerable uncertainty about the effectiveness of others, particularly in some groups of people (e.g., AstraZeneca (Cambridge, UK) in over-65s [ [62](#B62-vaccines-09-00379)]). At the time of writing, the extent to which vaccines will prevent transmission of the virus is even more unclear and the majority of people in most countries are unvaccinated [ [63](#B63-vaccines-09-00379)]. This has lead public health authorities to emphasise the need for vaccinated individuals to continue engaging to preventative behaviours such as social distancing, frequent handwashing and wearing a mask in public spaces to prevent the spread of the virus [ [64](#B64-vaccines-09-00379), [65](#B65-vaccines-09-00379), [66](#B66-vaccines-09-00379)]. [67](#B67-vaccines-09-00379)] speculates, freedom from social distancing and mask wearing requirements may be a powerful personal incentive for some individuals to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (see also [ [68](#B68-vaccines-09-00379)]). Equally, could health messages in use to encourage the uptake of the vaccine which minimise uncertainty and risks (e.g., 'vaccines are safe and effective') encourage vaccinated people to stop engaging in protective behaviours once vaccinated? 2. Study 1 [69](#B69-vaccines-09-00379)], in we which we randomly allocate participants to read different messages or no message at all, before measuring attitude and behavioural intentions. This methodology allows us to clearly establish cause and effect when examining the impact of different messages, and follows from a well-established approach used many previous vaccine messaging studies (e.g., [ [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00379), [70](#B70-vaccines-09-00379), [71](#B71-vaccines-09-00379)]). By conducting the survey online (vs. in a laboratory setting), we were able to recruit a large and broadly representative sample. We note that the different messages presented here were drawn from publicly available information and do not vary systematically in content, thus our main focus is comparing the different messages with the control group. We would also add that none of the messages were directly persuasive regarding vaccination, that is, none explicitly stated that the reader should accept a vaccine if offered. This study was pre-registered ( [https://aspredicted.org/ty8x9.pdf](https://aspredicted.org/ty8x9.pdf), accessed on 12 April 2021) and ethical oversight was provided by the Psychology Research Ethics Committee at the University of Cambridge (PRE.2020.034 with amendment on 9 January 2021). 2.1. Methods 2.1.1. Participants [72](#B72-vaccines-09-00379)] indicated a total sample size of at least N = 1865 would be required to detect an effect size of f = 0.1 in a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with five groups, at 95% power and an alpha level of 0.05. We deliberately recruited a larger sample to account for the exclusion criteria detailed below. [73](#B73-vaccines-09-00379)]: Respondi (London, UK; Respondi.com, accessed on 12 April 2021) and Prolific (London, UK; prolific.co, accessed on 12 April 2021), between 13-17 January 2021. These web-based platforms facilitate recruitment of participants by emailing or messaging individuals registered with the platform about available studies in which they participate. Participants receive compensation for completing studies (usually in the range of $2-3 US). Both panels are large, with each reporting more than 50,000 potential UK participants. Participants recruited via Respondi were quota sampled (using Qualtrics survey software) to match the age and sex distribution of the UK population. Participants recruited via Prolific were quota sampled by the platform to match the UK population in terms of age, sex, and ethnicity [ [74](#B74-vaccines-09-00379)]. 2.1.2. Materials and Procedure [Table 1](#vaccines-09-00379-t001); the full text of each condition can be found in the [supplementary information (Supplementary Material 1)](#app1-vaccines-09-00379). The Factbox format is a tabular format allowing people to compare potential benefits and harms in those taking and not taking a particular medical treatment. It has been shown to help people understand and remember such information [ [75](#B75-vaccines-09-00379), [76](#B76-vaccines-09-00379), [77](#B77-vaccines-09-00379)]. The text Q&A format was an edited version of text from the European Medicines Agency website. Both were designed to address concerns about efficacy and side effects, but the Factbox condition was much more explicit about side effects. Data reported in the Factbox and Q&A conditions was based on a trial of the Moderna vaccine, but the name was omitted from the text. No source for the information was given. The regulatory Approval message condition gave participants information taken from the European Medicines Agency website specifically designed to address concerns about the accelerated approval process of the COVID-19 vaccines. The scientific Mechanism message condition gave participants information about how vaccines, and in particular the mRNA vaccines developed against COVID-19, work, designed to address misinformation and misunderstandings about the mechanism and contents of the vaccines, given previous findings on the effect of a meaningful mechanistic explanation [ [78](#B78-vaccines-09-00379)] [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00379)] including the subscales capturing: belief that COVID-19 vaccines are effective (\"The COVID-19 vaccine is likely to\"; 1 = \"Definitely work for me\", 5 = \"Definitely not work for me\"; = 0.87), concern over COVID-19 side-effects (\"The side effects for people of getting the COVID-19 vaccine will be\"; 1 = \"None\", 5 = \"Life threatening\"; = 0.76), and concern about the speed of vaccine development and approval (\"The speed of developing and testing the vaccine means it will be\"; 1 = \"Really safe\", 5 = \"Really unsafe\"; = 0.79). Scores on the efficacy scale were reversed such that higher values indicate a perception that COVID-19 vaccines are effective. The original Freeman et al. [ [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00379)] scale dimensions were based on exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of a larger pool of items. Results from these original analyses indicated some scale items which only loaded weakly onto the identified factors (e.g., a risk question about likelihood of infection had a loading of 0.45 on the efficacy factor). In light of this, we added one or two face-valid items to each scale and several items were removed (see [Supplementary Material 2](#app1-vaccines-09-00379)for a full description of changes). As expected, the adapted subscales displayed higher reliability than the original scales (however, analyses using the original scale items produced essentially identical results; see [Supplementary Material 2](#app1-vaccines-09-00379)). [84](#B84-vaccines-09-00379)], with all items prefaced with the stem: \"If you were given the option of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine or not today how would you feel about the decision?\". The first was a three-item measure of feeling informed regarding the decision to vaccinate (example: \"I would feel I had made an informed choice\"; 1 = \"Strongly disagree\", 5 = \"Strongly agree\"; = 0.79). The second was a three-item measure of decision certainty (\"I feel sure about what to choose\"; 1 = \"Strongly disagree\", 5 = \"Strongly agree\"; = 0.92) (The six Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) items were selected as the most relevant to the COVID-19 vaccine decision and we had intended treat these as a single scale ( = 0.90). However parallel and exploratory factor analyses revealed two factors differentially impacted by the experimental intervention. This lead to the creation of the two ad hoc two scales reported here (a deviation from our pre-registration). With regards to the original DCS factor structure, the three certainty items come from the Uncertainty subscale, whereas the informed items in the current study comprise two items from the Informed subscale (knowing the risks and benefits) and one from the Effective Decision subscale (\"I would feel I had made an informed choice\").). 2.2.

Secondary Outcomes analyses that participants in the Factbox condition (M = 4.21, SD = 0.84) reported, on average, feeling more informed regarding their vaccination decision that those in the control condition (M = 3.94, SD = 0.91, p < 0.001, d = 0.30) and Mechanism condition (M = 4.04, SD = 0.89, p = 0.04, d = 0.20. Participants in the Q&A condition (M = 4.28, SD = 0.86) also reported feeling more informed than those in the control (p < 0.001, d = 0.38), Mechanism (p < 0.001, d = 0.28), and Approval conditions (M = 4.05, SD = 0.86, p = 0.001, d = 0.27). There was no effect of condition on decision certainty, F(4, 2092) = 0.53, p = 0.71. [Supplementary Material (Supplementary Material 3)](#app1-vaccines-09-00379). 2.3. Interim Discussion [53](#B53-vaccines-09-00379)] report that varying rates of minor side-effects (between 50% and 90% likelihood) had no impact on participants willingness to receive a vaccine. [78](#B78-vaccines-09-00379)]. 3. Study 2 [64](#B64-vaccines-09-00379)]. [https://aspredicted.org/bn2dm.pdf](https://aspredicted.org/bn2dm.pdf), accessed on 12 April 2021) and ethical oversight was provided by the Psychology Research Ethics Committee at the University of Cambridge PRE.2020.034 with amendment on 25 January 2021). 3.1. Methods 3.1.1. Participants [72](#B72-vaccines-09-00379)] indicated a total sample size of at least N = 1724 would be required to detect an effect size of f = 0.1 in a one-way ANOVA with four groups, at 95% power and an alpha level of 0.05. To account for the fact that our control group would be included in both sets of analyses, we doubled the size of the control group (thus the required sample size became N = 2155). We deliberately recruited a larger sample to account for the exclusion criteria detailed below. 3.1.2. Materials and Procedure [87](#B87-vaccines-09-00379)] website, and tweets from the UK National Health Service (NHS) [ [65](#B65-vaccines-09-00379)] and Public Health England [ [88](#B88-vaccines-09-00379)] twitter accounts. We developed three types of message: No Caution, Medium Caution, and High Caution. No caution messages highlighted the efficacy and safety of vaccines but made no mention of the need to continue protective behaviours once vaccinated. Medium Caution messages stated that while vaccines are broadly safe and effective, there is some uncertainty, and noted the need to maintain protective behaviours after vaccination. High Caution messages emphasized uncertainty around vaccine efficacy and noted the need to maintain protective behaviours after vaccination. For each type we created a Long version reflecting what might be found on a webpage, and a Short 2-3 sentence version formatted in the style of a social media post. All messages were presented with an identical image of vaccine vials. As an example, the Long of version of the Medium Caution message is shown in [Figure 3](#vaccines-09-00379-f003). ( [Supplementary Material 4](#app1-vaccines-09-00379)details the full text of all messages as presented to participants). [Supplementary Material 5](#app1-vaccines-09-00379)). [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00379)] ( = 0.97; as in Study 1, scores were reversed such that higher values indicate greater willingness). [89](#B89-vaccines-09-00379)] nine-item scale in which participants indicate how the information made them feel (e.g., \"Resentful\") on a slider with the labels \"Not at all\" (0) and \"Extremely\" (100) and the slider initially anchored at 50. Following Marcus et al., responses were averaged to create three subscales: anxiety ( = 0.92), aversion ( = 0.93), and enthusiasm ( = 0.85). These participants also completed measures of: how trustworthy (three items, = 0.97), engaging (three items, = 0.87), and believable they found the information; how much they felt they understood the information; the level of effort required to read the information; and the perceived quality of the evidence underlying the information (all identical to Study 1). 3.1.3. Analysis 3.2. Results [Supplementary Material 6](#app1-vaccines-09-00379)for comparisons between conditions). 3.3. Study 2 Discussion [64](#B64-vaccines-09-00379)]\u2014might undermine perceptions of vaccine efficacy. 4. General Discussion [14](#B14-vaccines-09-00379), [16](#B16-vaccines-09-00379)], a means of maintaining public trust in science (e.g., [ [15](#B15-vaccines-09-00379), [21](#B21-vaccines-09-00379)]), and also as an ethical imperative. We investigated how communications about the efficacy and side effects of COVID-19 vaccines affect individuals' vaccination intentions and related beliefs. Across two experiments we find that intention to receive a vaccine when offered is relatively high and that different messages\u2014ranging from detailed tables of vaccine efficacy and side effects to a simple claim that vaccines are safe and effective\u2014do not substantially increase intentions to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Encouragingly, we also did not find any evidence that such communications lead to a decrease in vaccination intentions either, such as through 'backfire effects' [ [90](#B90-vaccines-09-00379)]. This was true even for messages in Study 2 which expressed high uncertainty about vaccine efficacy (a range of \"41-98%\") and reminded the reader that protective behaviours would need to be maintained even once vaccinated. [8](#B8-vaccines-09-00379), [12](#B12-vaccines-09-00379)]. These beliefs remained essentially unchanged in the face of detailed information from clinical trials. We do note that in Study 2, simple claims that vaccines are safe and effective (with or without reference to specific details; i.e., both short and long versions) did increase perceptions of efficacy relative to controls, but had no main effect on vaccine intentions. This gives some indirect evidence that increasing perceptions of vaccine efficacy may have a limited subsequent impact on intentions. However further research should investigate the causal effects of changes in perceived efficacy on intentions to confirm this. [91](#B91-vaccines-09-00379), [92](#B92-vaccines-09-00379)]. Our results also indicate that COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is not simply due to \"a deficit of the data needed to make an informed decision,\" as suggested by Opel et al., [ [29](#B29-vaccines-09-00379)]. While the current studies do not provide a strong basis for public health authorities to communicate vaccine information with the aim of increasing uptake of the vaccine, we would note two important points: first, our study occurred in the midst of such communications, and second, increasing uptake is not the only reason for actively disseminating vaccine evidence such as the results of clinical trials. [93](#B93-vaccines-09-00379)]. Thus, informing the public, should be considered an important endpoint in itself. We did find some positive results in this regard; in Study 1 several of the more informative messages increased participants' sense of feeling informed regarding the decision of whether or not to vaccinate. Such transparent communication may also serve to build trust over the longer term [ [94](#B94-vaccines-09-00379), [95](#B95-vaccines-09-00379)]. [96](#B96-vaccines-09-00379), [97](#B97-vaccines-09-00379)] and preliminary studies on COVID-19 vaccine intentions [ [43](#B43-vaccines-09-00379), [54](#B54-vaccines-09-00379)] suggest that this framing may be effective in increasing vaccine acceptance. As more evidence of the effect of vaccination on transmission becomes available, researchers should investigate the how communicating such evidence impacts vaccine attitudes and intentions. This may be especially relevant for increasing vaccination rates in younger age groups who are at much lower risk of death or hospitalisation from COVID-19 and perceive less threat from the virus [ [31](#B31-vaccines-09-00379), [98](#B98-vaccines-09-00379)]. Another factor we did not examine in the current studies was the impact of message source. It is possible that attributing the information to a source considered trustworthy by the UK public (e.g., the NHS) may have increased the impact of information. [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00379), [91](#B91-vaccines-09-00379), [99](#B99-vaccines-09-00379)]). A comprehensive approach to addressing COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy should draw on all available tools, and not rely solely on communicating vaccine information via messages like those examined in the current studies. [100](#B100-vaccines-09-00379)]. Readers should also be mindful that results from our UK studies may not generalise to other countries, as many local contextual factors can influence vaccine hesitancy [ [9](#B9-vaccines-09-00379)]. For example, the development of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine has been hailed by the media as a 'British' success story, e.g., [ [101](#B101-vaccines-09-00379)] and this may lead to pro-vaccine attitudes being linked with national identity in the UK. 5.
