Not a place for discussion of illicit and illegal compounds. Hello, so I have several health issues that started appearing around 2 years ago (I'm 25 years old). The first of which being tinnitus, and an intense nerve pain that radiated in both my feet and hands, numbness and pain. I also have candida which is a fungal infection and causes a white biofilm on the tongue. I'm also prediabetic, but my blood sugar isn't even close to be causing me all these symptoms like diabetic neuropathy. The past 2 years have been a very dark time in my life, I've lost all my self confidence and spent most of this time feeling sorry for myself. The intense nerve damage and ringing in my ear has made me want to take my own life several times. I tried many things to change this, thyroid drugs, vitamins, gluten free diet/low carb/low fat, antioxidants, countless doctor visits trying to figure out what was wrong with me. I've also had intense PAIN in my neck, and back, stiffness and massive inflammation across my entire body which crippled me from having any form of social life. I've managed to do a few things to lower the amount of damage happening to my body and symptoms on a daily basis (Intermittent fasting and things related to lowering insulin resistance) but none have been as effective as my recent discovery. So I've actually been taking vitamin C (Absorbic acid) for a while now, but up until recently I decided to up the dose from my previous 2g to 3g. I felt nothing after increasing the dose for a while, so I thought why not up the dose 1 more gram to see what would happen to my body. So the next day I decided to take 4g of absorbic acid with my first meal of the day (when I break my fast). As if by magic within the next 2 hours I felt something I haven't felt in a long time, I was pain free! The difference between the 3g to 4g was night and day; It was bizzare because 3g did nothing for me but the extra gram of absorbic acid seemed to be doing some crazy work for my intense chronic inflammation. My pain must of went (from a scale of 1-10), from a 8-9 to a 3. I honestly couldn't believe it, I would have intense pain in my ankles when I walked which went way down after doing this. On top of this all, I seem to be in a MUCH better mood, and the dizziness/vertigo issue that I had before seems to be way better and rarely gets in the way anymore. I'm thinking of upping the dose to 6g, but there is only one issue is that I feel like I'm detoxing, it's not a crazy side effect compared to the issues I had before but I do notice I'm a little more tired since upping the dose to 4g. Oh yeah.. and the tinnitus is not gone but it's reduced darastically. I have a couple questions, does anyone know the mechanism behind this and why vitamin c seems to be really helping my \"mystery disease\" or whatever I have going on in my body? Also, how come the difference between 3g to 4g of vitamin c seems to be so significant in terms of symptom relief? Would I benefit even more if I upped the dose to 6-15g? "}
