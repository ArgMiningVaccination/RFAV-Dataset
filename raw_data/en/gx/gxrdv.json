Herbal teas are commonly considered to be a safer alternative for other beverages. But during pregnancy, you need to be careful about what you eat or drink. Examples of pregnancy-safe herbal teas include raspberry, ginger, chamomile, thyme. But are they all safe to be consumed while pregnant? Do they provide nutrition? Read on as we discuss the benefits and possible side effects of having herbal teas when pregnant and also a list of the popular ones. Is It Safe To Consume Herbal Tea During Pregnancy? Herbal teas are generally considered safe. They are usually considered to be a part of alternative medicine or traditional medicine. They are often used as natural remedies for various illnesses and conditions. But there is not enough scientific evidence to prove their safety or benefits during pregnancy. Herbal [teas that are safe](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/drinking-tea-during-pregnancy_00475947/) for one woman may not be safe for another. A given herbal tea may not be safe for you if you are allergic to the components in the herb. Also, the herbs might interfere with your medicines, possibly leading to reactions. Hence, you should know which herbs can be safe for you during pregnancy, and which ones you should avoid. You may try a small sample cup with your doctor's approval and check if it suits you. Buy these teas from only well-known and certified brands. [(12)](https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/is-it-safe/herbal-tea/). Popular Herbal Teas: Can You Drink Them When Pregnant? Below is a list of popular herbal teas that women consume during pregnancy. If your health permits and the doctor gives you a go-ahead, you may try these occasionally. But it is good not to make a habit out of it. 1. Peppermint leaf tea Peppermint herbal tea is said to alleviate a few pregnancy symptoms such as nausea, heartburn, vomiting, and bloating. Moreover, it provides stress relief. It can also help facilitate smooth delivery. However, high dosage should be avoided as it contains emmenagogue properties (causing abortion) [(1)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5686907/) [(2)](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d752/e95199871783b31c43962cf7238203613f9a.pdf). 2. Red raspberry leaf tea Also called as women's herb, red raspberry has strong antioxidants. It is known to be good for treating [morning sickness in pregnant](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/motion-sickness-during-pregnancy-causes-symptoms-and-treatments_00107828/) women. It can also prevent complications and make the delivery smoother. However, you should not have raspberry tea if you have high blood pressure, if you are planning a c-section, or are on medications [(3)](https://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=21855). This tea may be taken during labor. It is good to avoid it when you are at a risk of preterm labor. 3. Ginger tea Ginger helps improve your mood, reduce irritability, reduce digestion issues, and alleviate [nausea and vomiting,](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/causes-vomiting-pregnancy-17-remedies-keep-bay_0075698/) which are common during pregnancy [(4)](https://mothertobaby.org/fact-sheets/ginger-pregnancy/). It also has anti-inflammatory properties that strengthen the immune system. However, it could lower blood sugar levels and therefore may not suit women who are taking medications for diabetes. 4. Dandelion tea The leaves of Dandelion are known to have mild diuretic properties that help in the proper functioning of the urinary system. They also have a variety of nutrients that benefit prenatal health such as folate, vitamins A, C, and K, and minerals such as calcium and potassium. There are no proven studies on the use of [dandelion during pregnancy](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/dandelion-tea-during-pregnancy_00378368/) [(5)](https://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=21667). It should be avoided by women who have gall bladder problems and acidity. 5. Nettle tea The nettle leaves are diuretic and rich sources of iron and calcium. It could help prevent allergies during pregnancy. Nonetheless, it is good to ask your doctor before drinking it [(6)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.278.6152&rep=rep1&type=pdf). 6. Chamomile tea Sipping [chamomile tea](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/chamomile-tea-while-pregnant_00370635/) before bed is said to promote sleep. However, limiting it to one cup a day is recommended when you are pregnant. Avoid this tea if you're allergic to chamomile [(3)](https://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=21855). The tea provides relaxation though it could make you feel drowsy, and it could also interact with medications such as painkillers, sedatives and antimicrobial drugs. The above teas may have been found safe in women but the evidence is anecdotal. Therefore, it is safer to try a diluted version in small quantity and check if it has any adverse effects. Even if there are no adverse reactions, do not consume more than one cup a day. There are another set of herbs that you should avoid during pregnancy. Herbal Teas To Avoid During Pregnancy Some herbal teas that are not recommended for pregnant women include: 1. Pennyroyal tea This herbal extract belongs to the mint family. It is toxic and could result in liver failure, illness, and severe health concerns. In pregnant women, it could induce abortion and must be avoided [(7)](https://www.poison.org/articles/2016-mar/pennyroyal-oil). 2. Licorice root tea Licorice is usually used as a sweetener in drinks. However, [drinking licorice root](https://www.momjunction.com/articles/is-licorice-root-safe-for-consumption-during-pregnancy_00334731/) herbal tea during pregnancy could result in cognitive, psychiatric, and pubertal problems in the baby [(8)](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/185/5/317/2967089). 3. Slippery elm bark tea If you are pregnant, you should avoid herbal teas made with or including slippery elm bark. The bark is known to have harmful substances that are said to increase the risk of miscarriage. However, it is not scientifically proven [(9)](https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/herb/slippery-elm). 4. Alfalfa tea Alfalfa contains components that could have estrogenic effects and hence, is not recommended for pregnant women [(10)](https://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=21465). 5. Lemon balm tea A cup of lemon balm tea is said to alleviate anxiety, depression, irritability, and insomnia. But it is not recommended during pregnancy due to lack of sufficient evidence. Anecdotal evidence shows that lemon balm could have emmenagogic, antithyrotropic, and antigonadotropic effects [(11)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16635970). [(13)](https://www.pregnancybirthbaby.org.au/herbal-teas-during-pregnancy-and-breastfeeding).
