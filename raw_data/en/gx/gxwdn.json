Many people appreciate the different flavors that come with energy drinks but don't love the ingredients. Thankfully, there are organic options that taste great and are made with healthier components. The following options listed below are 14 different natural energy drinks with organic ingredients. They come in various flavors, so you'll be able to try them out until you find one that you like the most. As an added bonus, you don't have to worry about it being detrimental to your health like other energy drinks. The organic ingredients pose less risk than the standard ones in popular beverages. If you're looking to find a few different options to try out, we have created a list below. Best Organic Energy Drinks This list contains various brands that you can find in stores or online. Continue reading to find out more! Hi-Ball Organic Energy Known as an energy seltzer, [Hi-Ball Organic Energy](https://hiball.com/) combines energy drink and [seltzer water. ](https://restaurantclicks.com/best-sparkling-water-brands/) The drink is comprised of organic caffeine with organic guarana and ginseng. Additionally, Hi-Ball Organic Energy has zero calories or sugar. You can find the beverage in an assortment of flavors, including grapefruit, watermelon mint, vanilla, wildberry, peach, and lemon line. What I love about Hi-Ball Organic Energy is that [it's keto-friendly](https://restaurantclicks.com/best-keto-energy-drinks/). You won't find any artificial flavorings or carbs in the drink. Another valuable component is that you can purchase these beverages through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program and have them delivered directly to your front door. Runa Organic Clean Energy Drink As a company, [Runa](https://runa.com/) has an underlying goal of making a positive outcome for the environment, people, and society. With that mindset, they have created an energy drink that contains all clean ingredients, making it better for those who drink it and creating better circumstances for the atmosphere. Aside from the company's mission, I love that there are only ten calories per drink. Unlike coffee, where the flavoring adds unnecessary calories, Runa purposely includes ingredients that keep the level low but still taste great. Like the previous option, you can purchase Runa Organic Clean Energy Drink through Amazon. Make sure you try out the Wild Black Cherry flavor; you won't regret it! Sambazon Organic Amazon Energy Drink Sambazon is a company that sells various products with acai as its base. You can purchase fresh juice, frozen sorbet, ready-to-eat acai bowls, and, most importantly - their [Organic Amazon Energy Drink.](https://www.sambazon.com/) With an elevated antioxidant level and no naturally-occurring sugars, you'll have a healthy beverage that provides the kick of energy that you need. One of the best things about this drink is that the cost per can is less than other options, and you can buy 12-pack cans through the company website. Even better, you can utilize a payment plan and cover the cost in four payments. You can order in four different options, two being regular and the others being low-calorie versions. Guru Organic Energy Drink As a plant-based alternative to the typical energy drink, Guru Organic Energy Drink contains natural ingredients. You will find matcha, echinacea, guarana, green tea, stevia, monk fruit, and ginseng in each can. The blend brings an earthy yet flavorful experience. Something that I appreciate about the Guru brand is that they sell a variety pack with one can of each of their four flavors. You'll get the original [Guru Organic Energy Drink](https://www.guruenergy.com/en-us/products), Organic Energy Lite, [Yerba Mate, and Matcha](https://restaurantclicks.com/types-of-tea/). If you decide to get a whole pack of the original or the lite, you can choose to get your cans in eight or 12-ounce sizes. Marquis Another plant-based option on our list of the best organic energy drinks is Marquis. The company markets its beverage as a [sparkling sugar-free energy drink](https://restaurantclicks.com/best-sugar-free-energy-drinks/). With zero carbs, sugar, or calories, you won't be consuming unnecessary ingredients. You will, however, get the boost of energy needed to get your day started on the right foot. Although [Marquis](https://drinkmarquis.com/) has zero sugar, it's still a sweetened beverage with the addition of monk fruit. Additionally, the drink provides various vitamins and immune-boosting elements. You can find Marquis in four unique flavors, which include lychee peach, mango ginger, citrus yuzu, and my personal favorite, super berry. NOOMA Organic Sport Energy Drink Of all the organic energy drinks, Nooma has the most fruit-flavored options. You can choose between dragonfruit, pineapple mango, tangerine, and lemon lime. If you can't decide which sounds most appealing, you can get them all in a variety pack! [Nooma Organic Sport Energy Drink](https://www.drinknooma.com/) uses organic green coffee bean extract, a newer addition to the energy drink market. These coffee beans are prepared in a completely different way than regular coffee beans and stay in their natural form. However, they are mighty. One can of Nooma Organic Sport Energy Drink has 120mg of caffeine and only two grams of sugar! Rockstar Organic Energy Drink Those familiar with [popular energy drinks](https://restaurantclicks.com/best-energy-drinks/) have likely seen the [Rockstar](https://www.rockstarenergy.com/) brand on store shelves. The company isn't known for being organic, but they have included an organic option for those looking for cleaner ingredients. Certified by the USDA, [Rockstar Organic Energy Drink](https://restaurantclicks.com/best-rockstar-energy-flavors/) comes in two flavors, strawberry and island fruit. What I love most about this drink is that I get the great taste of the regular Rockstar with a healthier set of ingredients. Made with a blend of caffeine (from organic green coffee beans), guarana, B-vitamins, taurine, ginseng, and milk thistle, you get all-natural elements with a powerful energy punch. Aspire With a motivational name like Aspire, you know the product is going to be powerful. Known as the \"healthy energy drink,\" [Aspire](https://aspiredrinks.com/) has no calories, sugar, or carbs and is considered keto-friendly. A small amount of Sucralose is included to sweeten the drink, but the primary flavoring comes from natural ingredients. I can appreciate that Aspire sells in several stores. However, the company also has its own subscription service where you can save 10% by enrolling. They also have unique flavors that snap your taste buds into attention. You can choose from cranberry, lemony lime, mango lemonade, dark cherry lime, raspberry and acai, apple and acai, and orange pineapple. DARK DOG Organic Energy Drink The DARK DOG company claims they are \"greatness with no limits.\" And they prove that with their line of energy drinks, made with 100% organic ingredients. While they don't have many flavors in their line-up (original, coconut water, blood orange, and cranberry mint), they have earned a powerful reputation in the energy drink market. The base of a [DARK DOG](https://www.darkdog-organic.com/) Organic Energy Drink comes from green tea and green coffee beans. For flavoring, they add cane sugar and organic berries. Tasting the cranberry mint option, I could tell the drink wasn't made artificially. You can taste the difference in the cranberry, which is highly flavorful. OCA Plant Based Energy Drink As another plant-based option, OCA has the same amount of caffeine as one cup of coffee. However, the [OCA Plant-Based Energy Drink](https://www.drinkoca.com/) is based on cassava root extract, not coffee beans. One can of OCA has nine grams of natural sugar and 60 calories. Something that I find interesting about the brand is that the company derives its flavors from the Amazon rainforest. So while there are only four to choose from, they have a unique origin story. When purchasing, you can select from berry acai, guava passion fruit, mango, and prickly pear with lime. There are no artificial sweeteners, as all flavoring comes from natural ingredients. PURPS Plant-Based Organic Energy Drink Headquartered in California, the goal of the PURPS company is to unite nature and science to create [a healthy energy drink. ](https://restaurantclicks.com/healthy-energy-drinks/) They have combined premium ingredients to accomplish this and use no artificial flavorings, coloring, or preservatives. You can find this beverage online on the company website or in stores nationwide. The founders of [PURPS](https://purps.com/) include the creator of RVCA, award-winning surfer Kelly Slater, and a doctor of autoimmune deficiency and inflammation, Dr. Purps. The trio wanted to create an alternative to standard energy drinks that would also have health benefits and appeal to the younger generation. The collaboration produced the PURPS Plant-Based Organic Energy Drink. Remedy Natural Energy Drink Known as the \"good energy,\" [Remedy Natural Energy Drink](https://www.remedydrinks.com/) is a fizzy beverage that is created with kombucha. As a result, the drink has health benefits in that it has live cultures, polyphenols, and organic acids. You will also find green coffee beans on the list of ingredients to give the beverage a kick of energy. Although this drink does contain caffeine, I don't personally like that it's a lesser amount than what you get in a cup of coffee. The company says this is to keep from getting the jitters and that the amount included is more than enough to help you power through the day. Yerba Mate Taking a different twist to organic energy drinks, Yerba Mate is created from the mate leaf found in the South American Amazon rainforest. This single ingredient gives you the benefits of three different products (coffee, tea, and chocolate) in one form. Mate leaf has been used for years in various ways and only recently has taken the shape of an energy drink. Not only does [Yerba Mate](https://guayaki.com/) come in many different flavors, but you can buy it in various forms through their website. The traditional can option is available, as well as glass bottles and as a dry loose leaf. It's important to note that not all flavors are available in each form. Zevia The Zevia brand is the option on this list that customers can most readily find on store shelves. While many others are sold in stores, it's not as broadly as [Zevia](https://www.zevia.com/collections/energy-drinks). Coming in six different flavors, Zevia Energy has zero calories and sugar. Additionally, each can has 120mg of caffeine, which is higher than a standard cup of coffee. Outside of the ease of availability, I love Zevia Energy's low price point. Many organic options are too pricy for people to afford, but Zevia keeps their prices at just around $2 per can. This amount is lower than the cost of most standard energy drinks!
