[dragonlover](https://vestibular.org/participant/isismadec/) Quick update: woke up today and finally feeling normal(fingers crossed) besides taking recommended supplements, taking a lot of Vitamin C and trying to get plenty of sleep I started taking NAC's about a week and a half ago and 120 mg of ginkgo biloba(based on my own research of what can help with brain fog and diziness). Not sure how much that contributed to me feeling better but I feel it had an impact since previous supplements didn't help much. Hoping it will stay this way as I am finally able to function and do day to day activities. I advise to do some research before taking the supplements, I know ginkgo biloba might not be for everyone.

May I ask to be reminded? Did your doctors determine if you had \"garden variety\" blood clotting, or if it was this kind? Or do you know?

Figured I'd give you all an update on my progress. Got the Vaccine on April 27th. Have dealt with persistent dizziness and tinnitus ever since. I tried the supplements that dizzyfromvaccine suggested on here for two weeks, unfortunately, it didn't get rid of my dizziness or tinnitus. I've gone to 6 different doctors (3 Ents, 3 vestibular specialists) all of whom have had different outlooks on what's causing this. First two ENT's refused to acknowledge that this was caused by the vaccine at all, very frustrating. Third Ent prescribed Prednisone which didn't do anything. The first vestibular specialist prescribed a low dose (0.25mg) of Xanax, she claimed it would help alleviate the dizziness and the tinnitus, it didn't do anything. The past two vestibular specialists I've seen are both claiming that these symptoms are from a \"Vestibular Migraine.\" They said they were 99.9% certain that's what's causing this. They acknowledged that the vaccine triggered this event and that the brain is overcompensating and that I need to take medication to get the brain back down to normal levels. I've maybe had two bad headaches in my life so this seemed far-fetched but at this point, I'm willing to try whatever will make this go away. They want me to use the Vestibular Migraine diet and go on medication. They claim that if I do this, there's an 80% chance I will recover in 6 weeks. They said if I don't want to go that route, I can try using the vestibular migraine diet and take 200 mg twice a day (400mg) of Vitamin B2 and 400 mg twice a day (800mg) of Magnesium oxide. As of now I'm testing the supplements and diet but am planning to start the medication soon and will post updates on how it goes. For everyone on this forum, Please, if you get better, post it on here so that people can see that there's light at the end of the tunnel. Post what worked for you and what didn't work, we're all in this together.

For instance this one has blood thinning properties and people that are allergic to poison ivy or poison oak may be allergic to it also. I can't imagine having an internal allergic reaction like I've had to topical poison ivy! Also it can be fatal in too large of a dosage. Sarah is right - it's very important to do your own research and learn how to use these non-prescription supplements safely! It's also advisable to get input from your doctor before using meds, even OTC ones. We sure don't want to end up sicker, while attempting to pursue bettering our health... [dragonlover](https://vestibular.org/participant/isismadec/), [Adam](https://vestibular.org/participant/adamk/), [dragonlover](https://vestibular.org/participant/isismadec/)and 1 people reacted [@heybro](https://vestibular.org/participant/heybro/) When I reported this to the The Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia (the USA FDA equivalent), the collector advised (based on their data) that persons that had a bad reaction to the first shot didn't seem to have as bad to the second one.. Or vice versa. They were following up with participants after their second jab to monitor the symptoms and collect data for this assumption. I think we need to report our side effects (if you haven't already), so authorities can collect data on this and that can inform policy and decisions. Otherwise if there is no data available, then no one can investigate this and answers are harder to come by... and then doctors just dismiss you. High doses of Vitamin D have helped my vertigo start to resolve. This video was also great in helping to understand the anxious feelings which resulted from vertigo all of the time: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZidGozDhOjg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZidGozDhOjg) - I'm not an overly anxious person, so I was totally unprepared dealing with the anxiety about vertigo and having to live with this condition forever. [@markm90](https://vestibular.org/participant/markm90/) How is your eye floater, can heal by itself? I am also seeing eye floater after Pfizer vaccine for 2 weeks already. [@wynnwolter](https://vestibular.org/participant/wynnwolter/) YES! It's so friggin annoying. And then my g-damn doctor tells me the same thing. I love my doctor but after this I may have to reconsider. Of course I'm anxious and stressed, because something caused by a vaccine that no doctor knows anything about is running me into the ground, and everyone is telling me it's anxiety. The more I'm told it's anxiety, the more stressed I'm getting. It's a terrible cycle of getting nowhere and making everything worse for me. I had a bout of vertigo about 3-4 years ago due to a viral infection, which eventually seemed to resolve on its own. I was in bed for 2-3 weeks with severe vertigo. After the illness subsided, I had MRIs done and saw an ear specialist who concluded there was nothing physically wrong with me. During this time I took Prochlorperazine maleate which helped to manage the symptoms and the vertigo went about for about 95% of the time. On 3rd June 2021, I received my first pfizer vaccine. After about a week after the vaccination, I developed severe vertigo and nausea, as well as chills, fever and swollen glands. I ended up in the ED due to a severe headache response and symptoms. I thought I was going to die. At the ED, I also did functional tests with their physical therapist and they also determined it wasn't crystals in my ear that need to be put back in place (we did exercises on the bed and a bunch of functional tests). This was consistent with the work done prior. Whilst the chills, fever and glands have now returned to normal and ibuprofen helped, I still have quite bad vertigo and it is quite debilitating. Whilst my previous vertigo was primarily in the head/ears/side of head, this vertigo has also been coming from the stomach area too - Which makes me feel like I'm on a ride all of the time. I am again on Prochlorperazine maleate, however it isn't as effective against the stomach vertigo feelings. This is impacting my sleep, with some nights I'm only able to achieve about an hours sleep. I've also felt anxiety at 110% because of all of this which I've never felt as intense before. I've been doing exercises from this book, [https://www.amazon.com.au/Waking-Tiger-Peter-Levine/dp/155643233X]and it has helped get rid of some of the anxiety. Since the ED episode, my doctor has undertaken a full set of blood tests and everything appears normal apart from lower than normal vitamin D levels (not ultra low though). I've started taking about 5000 IU of vitamin D a day (split up over the day as 1000 IU) with vitamin C and the vertigo is actually going away. Today is the first day I've not had to take Prochlorperazine maleate and have just been taking a vitamin D every 4-5 hours. I've been trying to do reading on why vitamin D is resolving my symptoms and the peer reviewed research just isn't there yet. There are a few studies and good blogs, but my own GP pretty much dismissed me as being fine and told me to get the second vaccine or I would have to start the cycle over. I'd like to know why Vitamin D is now working given the doctor told me there is nothing wrong with me. Hope this information help someone else. Hi - It sounds like you've been on a difficult journey! My vitamin D level came up deficient early on in this journey - 14.1. My doctor had me take the once a week prescription level dosing for 8 weeks, which brought my level about mid-range of normal, 50s - after which I'm now taking OTC D3 2000IU daily. Sorry to say, that didn't resolve my symptoms, although I've gotten better in an up and down fashion over the course of 3+ months, but then had a dratted total relapse episode a week ago that I'm recovering from currently. I've interrupted my natural course with a Medrol pak twice now, most recently following my recent relapse, but I don't think the Vitamin D deficiency or replenishment has affected my course. Rather, as a number of others here have also concluded, I think my body having time to struggle to recover and recuperate from this has been my greatest boon. [LadyD](https://vestibular.org/participant/ladyd/), [dragonlover](https://vestibular.org/participant/isismadec/), [Adam](https://vestibular.org/participant/adamk/)and 3 people reacted I just wanted to say that though our tests may come back normal and our doctors may not be able to perceive anything wrong with us, we have been living in our bodies all our lives and we know when something is wrong, when something abnormal is happening for us. If you read the amazing amount of information available on this VeDA website beyond just reading this forum - for instance for starters, the Vision Statement at the bottom of this page - you will see ample evidence of the complexity of vestibular issues and the long, difficult journey many have traveled before us in pursuit of regaining a balanced and healthy life. I'm so thankful for this place, a God-send to me - truly a refuge in my time of trouble! Hello. Wanted to share my experience. 1st Pfizer shot received April 29. On day 8, I woke up with swelling around my eyes (peri orbital swelling) that lasted 3 days. MD thought it was allergies. I have never been allergic to anything. On day 10, I woke up with a horrible migraine and dizziness. The dizziness made me feel like I had visual problems or I was in a fun house where it was difficult to determine depth. The more intense dizziness lasted 3-4 days and then it became sporadic for another week. I decided to delay the second shot. I was experiencing intermittent dizziness for another month until June 20 when my dizziness returned. The symptoms are worse when I lay down so I've been sleeping nearly in a sitting position for 3 nights. I have no idea what triggered the worsening of the dizziness other than I had a get together on Saturday which took a lot of active prep work and stress. My primary MD ordered basic labs and all looked good except my vit d which was just under the normal range. He told me directly that he has no idea if this could be from the vax since he has no more info than we do. I'm extremely disappointed the symptoms came back and am glad I held off on 2nd dose. Started quercetin, zinc, vit d yesterday. I have s history of migraines so can't attribute the headaches to the vax. I feel Sudafed has helped my headaches and has made my head feel less heavy. Hope this helps someone. "}
