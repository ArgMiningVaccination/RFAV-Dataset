Roth, MD, MS FROM THE CHANCELLOR FOR HEALTH SCIENCES One of the great things about working at an academic health center is seeing the many ways in which our missions of education, research and clinical care reinforce one another. Our biomedical research enterprise, which has long focused on developing state-of-the-art diagnostic and therapeutic technology, is also a powerful driver of economic activity in New Mexico. Each year, UNM Health Sciences Center research activity pumps tens of millions of dollars into the state's economy, supporting hundreds of well-paid, highly skilled jobs. An additional economic boost comes in the form of new private sector biotech startups that are spun off from UNM HSC research innovations. Each of these new startups has the potential to grow into a thriving business, creating more jobs and opportunity in our state. This year, we were fortunate to see renewal of funding for our Clinical & Transla- tional Science Center, which does a tremendous job of training and mentoring the next generation of researchers, creating a clear pathway to continue building on our successes. Our program was one of only four nationally that had an exceptional score, allowing it to be fully funded. And the UNM Cancer Center won coveted comprehensive designation from the National Cancer Institute. We earned an \"outstanding\" evaluation in four key areas of competence from the National Cancer Advisory Board. These are examples of what makes an academic health center unique and what enables the Health Sciences Center to make such a significant impact on the health and well-being of New Mexicans. We all can be proud of these accomplishments, and I'm grateful to our entire research community for the passion, creativity and dedication they bring to their work. RESEARCH ANNUAL REPORT 2015 3 Richard S. Larson, MD, PhD FROM THE EXECUTIVE VICE CHANCELLOR AND VICE CHANCELLOR FOR RESEARCH We did it again! I am pleased to report that the UNM Health Sciences Center contin- ues to make scientific breakthroughs while building its research mission, but in FY 2015 we once again outdid ourselves, securing a record total of $161 million in funding. Our funding success is a tribute to the inspired work of our faculty, students and staff, who continue to break new ground in so many areas and have done a terrific job of putting UNM on the map as a center of research and innovation. This achievement caps more than a decade of continual growth in extramural funding and highlights our focus on developing major new discoveries that im- prove the health and well-being of New Mexicans. But that is only part of the story. The past year also saw the renewal of National Institutes of Health funding for our Clinical & Translational Science Center. The comprehensive designation bestowed on the UNM Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute is another major achievement. These developments make us one of only 29 institutions in the nation with both a Comprehensive Cancer Center and a Clinical and Translational Science Award. Adding to the good news, the Brain and Behavioral Health Institute recently won a five-year $11.6 million grant from the National Institute of General Medical Scienc - es to develop a new Center for Brain Recovery and Repair. As you'll read in these pages, our researchers are also finding fresh ways to tackle youth obesity, protecting our communities with new methods for diagnosing and treating tuberculosis and searching for more effective tools to fight deadly MRSA infections. Stay tuned for further discovery and innovation! 4 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Nancy Ridenour, PhD, RN, APRN, BC, FAAN FROM THE DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF NURSING The College of Nursing celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2015, marking a long-standing tradition of providing local and national leadership and innova-tion with a comprehensive approach to meeting our education, practice and research missions. Throughout its history, the College has focused on promoting and enhancing health and wellness, along with creative initiatives and strategies to help pa-tients, families and communities manage health challenges. Our research portfolio includes important work in cancer prevention and screen- ing, sleep apnea, pain, respiratory conditions, women's health, childhood asthma and rural health, along with problems affecting particular populations, such as Native Americans and veterans. College of Nursing faculty serve as leaders and key members of interdisciplinary research teams. They also contribute to local and national initiatives dedicated to advancing the science of health, including UNM's Clinical & Translational Science Center and the federally funded Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. Faculty also hold leadership roles in national and international organizations and share the results of their research widely to extend the impact of their work across New Mexico and well beyond. One project being led by Stephen Hernandez, PhD, is exploring Air Force officer and enlisted nursing personnel's perceived levels of stigma and barriers to ac - cessing mental health services to deal with issues of stress and resilience. The project's findings will provide a foundation to further study the unique population of military nurses and medical technicians with the long-term goal of developing meaningful interventions for this vulnerable group. The College's long tradition of collaborative research and service continues to bear fruit. We will continue to work with colleagues and partners to address New Mexico health priorities for many years to come. RESEARCH ANNUAL REPORT 2015 5 Lynda S. Welage, PharmD, FCCPFROM THE DEAN OF THE COLLEGE OF PHARMACY College of Pharmacy scientists are creative visionaries. With a combined 21 active U.S. patents and another 34 patent applications pend- ing, our faculty researchers are seeking innovative solutions to combat deadly diseases and health issues. Some of their work has led to patents on important inventions to treat melanoma and tuberculosis and to better diagnose pneumo - nia and other infections. Our faculty members engage in a wide variety of research that seeks to under - stand how arsenic and uranium cause disease, how a radiotracer might diagnose appendicitis or better treat asthma - even how smokers might kick the habit without packing on the pounds. Our scientists are dedicated to advancing human health through better drugs or drug target identification and in clinical settings to achieve better therapeutic outcomes and improvements in health care policies. Research funding at the College continues to grow. Thanks in part to our \"Re - quest-for-Proposals Intramural Pilot Funding Initiative, \" which stimulated inter - disciplinary collaboration on large-scale grant proposals, research grants and contracts awarded to our faculty members exceeded $7.1 million last year. We now rank in the top tier of colleges of pharmacy in National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding and in total research dollars. More than 30 of our faculty members are involved in research. Faculty submitted 80 proposals during FY 2015. Impressively, 50 of these proposals were funded, for a success rate of 63 percent. This year, a team of environmental health researchers successfully obtained a prestigious NIH P50 grant to establish the Center for Native American Environ-mental Health Equality Research. The researchers also submitted an NIH P42 Superfund Basic Science Research Center application that will investigate the impact of exposure to toxic metals on human health. 6 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Martha Cole McGrew, MD FROM THE EXECUTIVE VICE DEAN OF THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE The UNM School of Medicine continued its success in growing research funding and programmatic initiatives amid an increasingly competitive environment for research support. In the fiscal year ending in June 2015 the school set another record in total fund- ing, reaching $143 million. This represents an increase of $10 million compared to FY 2014. National Institutes of Health (NIH) support for research has remained nearly flat over the past five years. Given that and the declining purchasing power of awarded funds, the School of Medicine's success is all the more remarkable. Two UNM departments, Family Medicine and Pathology, were ranked in the Top 10 in the country among their peer departments for NIH funding. Ten faculty mem-bers received more than $1 million in NIH funding - with three of those receiving more than $3 million. With strong participation from the School of Medicine, the Clinical & Translational Science Center (CTSC) submitted the second-best application nationwide and received NIH funding for its second five-year award. The CTSC consistently leads in team science, population health and community engagement, often serving as a model for larger institutions. The refunding of the CTSC ensures that this key translational research framework will continue to under - pin and support School of Medicine research. Our six Signature Programs continue to support team science in key areas of health, including cancer, brain and behavioral health, infectious disease and immu-nity, child health, cardiovascular and metabolic disease and environmental health. The National Cancer Institute recently bestowed coveted \"comprehensive\" desig- nation on the UNM Cancer Center. According to the NIH, comprehensive cancer centers demonstrate an added depth and breadth of research, as well as substan-tial trans-disciplinary research that bridges the scientific areas of basic, clinical and community-based research related to cancer. RESEARCH ANNUAL REPORT 2015 7 Principal Investigator Robert Rhyne, MD Professor and Vice Chair of Research, Department of Family & Community Medicine Grant Name Health Extension Rural Offices: Translating Research into Localities Grantor Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality People living in rural counties are nearly twice as likely as people in big cities to overdose on prescription painkillers, so it's not surprising that New Mexico, with its wide-open spaces, has one of the highest death rates from prescription opioids in the U.S. It's a disturbing trend for Robert Rhyne, MD, a professor of Family & Community Medicine and co-director of the Clinical & Translational Science Center's Community Engagement and Research Core. \"Small-town docs are passionately interwoven into their communities, caring for friends and neighbors, \" Rhyne says. \"Entire towns' reliance on their local physicians leaves little time for professional networking, education or advancement. The challenge becomes providing the highest standards of care when geographically isolated. \" Rhyne believes that the treatment of chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) such as arthritis, back pain or headaches is a frustrating problem for rural primary care providers. \"We're overprescribing pain medication based on a dated medical paradigm, \" he says. \"Newly established clinical guidelines can take years for adoption into clinical practice, \" Rhyne adds, \"so we're developing a system called practice detailing to deliver the most current evidence-based information in the most usable format for rural practitioners to manage CNCP.\" Rhyne's team is conducting a comparative study designed to deliver CNCP guidelines in a toolkit that rural clinicians can - and will - apply to their patients using an algorithm that best fits rural practices. From that algorithm, developed partly with feedback from community clinicians, the detailed toolkit is continually evolving to provide evidence-based clinical guidelines for treating CNCP patients with and without opioids. \"We're training physicians to better conduct patient assessments and explore treatment options such as physical and behavioral therapy or sleep therapy, surgical interventions, acupuncture and others - with opioids as the final treatment option, \" Rhyne explains. \"We're adaptive and interactive, using two-way communication to create better informa- tion and buy-in from rural practitioners in communities across the state. \"GAME CHANGER PRACTICE DETAILING TACKLES OPIOID OVERPRESCRIPTION 8 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER The UNM Clinical & Translational Science Center (CTSC) was awarded a five-year, $23-million grant renewal in 2015 following a fierce national competition. It received one of the highest scores in the nation, becoming one of only four such centers nationally to receive full Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This award recognizes UNM's success in conducting innovative, cutting-edge biomedical research that quickly and safely con-verts fresh ideas into New Mexico clinical practice, says Richard S. Larson, MD, PhD, executive vice chancellor and vice chancellor for research at the UNM Health Sciences Center. \"Through our CTSC, we're bringing state-of-the-art therapies and technologies to our citizens and our families that otherwise wouldn't be available, \" Larson says. \"We're accelerating basic health discovery and ways of delivering care into clinical trials in practices in all 33 counties across the state. It's very exciting.\" The CTSC pools essential resources for researchers to more effi- ciently collaborate, design and conduct their studies, while adding an extensive mentoring program to help young scientists learn to create novel medical innovations. The CTSC also guides investigative teams who are continually introducing important new medications, diagnostic tools, and best-practice protocols to treat New Mexico patients with complex diseases like addiction, obesity and diabetes. In addition to supporting research by increasing laboratory space, cultivating junior researchers, offering regulatory and legal guidiance Principal Investigator Richard S.

UNM's biomedical research has delivered discoveries in many areas, including infectious disease, metabolic disorders and substance abuse. More than 500 CTSC researchers and support staff have led the way in devel-oping vaccines for deadly infections like drug-resistant tuberculosis, Larson says. They currently conduct 125 clinical trials across every New Mexico county, along with extensive community-based research throughout the state. The NIH introduced the CTSA network in 2006 to speed new drug therapies, vaccines and diagnostic tools through the developmental pipeline from bench to bedside. UNM first joined the CTSA consortium in 2010, becoming one of just 62 universities in the country with a program to convert basic laboratory discoveries into medical therapies and devices that make a real differ - ence in patients' lives. \"Our first five years provided a sturdy foundation on which to expand our effectiveness in developing new health and treatment concepts, and seeing them all the way through to actual patient care, \" Larson says. \"In the future we'll be adding to CTSC's scope and focus, particularly in the areas of translational workforce de - velopment, multi-site study support, participant recruit - ment and CTSA consortium-wide initiatives.\"In addition to its tremendous economic contribution to New Mexico - nearly 40 biotech businesses have spun off from research conducted at UNM over the past decade - the renewed CTSA represents UNM HSC's ascendance into the higher tier of academic health centers nationally, Larson adds. \"Perhaps most importantly, the CTSA enables us to conduct meaningful research that brings hope to our patients throughout the state, \" he says. \"This accom-plishment demonstrates the terrific progress we have made in just five years as a CTSA recipient. We are excit - ed to contemplate the many new advances in coming years that will benefit New Mexicans.\" RESEARCH RENEWAL UNM'S CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE AWARD EXTENDED10 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Principal Investigator Cheryl Willman, MD Director and CEO, UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center Grant Name P30 Cancer Center Support Grant Grantor National Institutes of Health/ National Cancer Institute PROMISES KEPT UNM CANCER CENTER WINS COVETED NCI DESIGNATION \"Fifteen years ago, we made a promise to be of service to the people of New Mexico and to overcome New Mexico's cancer burden, \" says Cheryl Willman, MD. \"To do that, we sought to be one of the nation's very best: a National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive Cancer Center, \" says Will-man, director and CEO of the UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center. \"And we delivered!\" The Cancer Center underwent a rigorous process to achieve its com- prehensive designation last summer. The highly sought-after desig-nation recognizes the center's achievements in four areas: providing integrated cancer diagnosis and treatment, providing access to nation-al clinical trials, conducting world-class cancer research and educating the next generation of cancer health care and scientific professionals. UNM's cancer research is supported by more than $72 million in annual extramural funding and takes advantage of regional scientific and engineering strengths. Cancer Center scientists collaborate with col-leagues at Sandia National Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laborato - ry and the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute. UNM scientists also work with researchers at New Mexico State Uni- versity. These collaborations have led to breakthroughs in targeted therapies and cancer diagnostics. The UNM Comprehensive Cancer Center also conducts clinical re - search. As part of the Oncology Research Information Exchange Net - work, it is launching a program to offer patients an opportunity to have their cancer tumors sequenced to benefit not only cancer research but also themselves when newer, better treatments become available. In addition, the Cancer Center's NCI Community Oncology Research Program grant supports access to clinical trials in diverse communities throughout the state, helping patients and cancer scientists alike.RESEARCH ANNUAL REPORT 2015 11 In the substance use and mental health world, researchers know that early detection and treatment can greatly improve outcomes. In New Mexico these conditions often go untreated because of stigma and lack of access due to the limited behavioral health workforce. Deborah Altschul, PhD, aims to address these challenges head-on with her New Mex - ico Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment program.\"Most people already go to primary and urgent care for other health issues, \" she says. \"Our goal is to infuse behavioral health into these settings. That way, treatment is easily accessible in nonthreatening settings.\" Each of the grant's sites houses a behavioral health provider along with a certified peer support worker. Every patient undergoes a universal screen that takes only minutes to complete. If the screen is positive for substance abuse, depression, anxiety or trauma, patients are immediately introduced to the behavioral health team for further assessment and treatment. \"This increases access to convenient, evidence-based treatment, \" Altschul says. Altschul and her team collect data on every person who is screened. They follow 20 percent of the patients who screen positive every six months for two years to evalu-ate whether this approach effectively integrates behavioral health into primary care settings. \"By putting screening and treatment where people already are comfortable seek - ing help, we hope to catch substance abuse and mental health issues before they become big problems, \" Altschul says. \"Additionally, given our state's limited behavioral health workforce and health dispar - ities, this research has major implications for public health in New Mexico.\"Principal Investigator Deborah Altschul, PhD Assistant Professor and Division Chief, Community Behavioral Health, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Grant Name New Mexico Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment Grantors Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, New Mexico Behavioral Health Services Division EARLY DETECTION BEHAVIORAL HEAL TH SCREENING IN A PRIMARY CARE SETTING12 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER The human brain - containing some 86 billion neurons (and trillions of connections among them) - is the most intricate known structure in the universe. A special team is needed to tackle this complexity and devise new treatments for neurological diseases and injuries. UNM's Brain & Behavioral Health Institute (BBHI) takes a mul- tidisciplinary approach to attacking brain-related problems, bringing together researchers from across campus, includ-ing the departments of Neurology, Neurosurgery, Neurosci-ences and Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. \"Research and education have traditionally been quite compartmentalized, \" says BBHI director Bill Shuttleworth, PhD, Regents' Professor in the Department of Neurosciences and associate director of the Clinical & Translational Science Center. \"BBHI dramatically changes the dynamic. We have an opportunity to leverage each other's expertise to enrich research programs and be more responsive to national funding opportunities. \" One example is the competitive five-year $11.6 million federal grant that BBHI recently secured to establish a new Center for Brain Recovery and Repair. The grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences will fund five junior investigators to launch new research into brain stimu-lation techniques and ways of regenerating brain tissue. The money will also help provide research support. \"We're a platform to facilitate diverse programs that address brain health across the lifespan, \" Shuttleworth says. \"This is one of BBHI's key achievements to date. \" BBHI is committed to tailoring its patient-centered research to meet the unique needs of New Mexicans. Starting in 2013, BBHI faculty spent 18 months meeting with individu-als and advocacy organizations to find out what mattered most to them.DREAM TEAM COLLABORATING ACROSS CAMPUS TO TREAT BRAIN INJURY Principal Investigator Bill Shuttleworth, PhD Director, UNM Brain & Behavioral Health Institute, Regents' Professor, Department of Neurosciences Grant Name UNM Center for Brain Recovery and RepairGrantor National Institutes of Health/National Institute of General Medical SciencesRESEARCH ANNUAL REPORT 2015 13 Community groups \"are really the engine pulling the train, \" Shuttleworth says. He credits the New Mexico Brain Net - work, a coalition of patient advocacy organizations, with helping to shape the research agenda. \"They helped us develop a meaningful program. \" Network representatives will be included in steering com- mittees to help shape the center's development, he says. The group has been meeting monthly and is also working with the Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook University. The Alda Center generally focuses on teaching scientists to communicate with the public, but the New Mexico advo - cates have helped flip the paradigm; now, the center has become interested in teaching scientists how to listen to laypeople. This work is funded by a federal Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute award to BBHI to facilitate progress in Alzheimer's disease, cerebral cavernous malfor - mations and autism. \"We're trying to do something special, \" Shuttleworth says. \"We're trying to pull people together from very different groups across campus. People have been working on brain disorders at UNM for decades and there has been a pent-up feeling that we could do more collaboratively, across disciplines. \" BBHI is making progress in its research, Shuttleworth says. \"It has an ambitious agenda. But, still, there's a lot of hard work to do to break down some of those barriers. We're looking for opportunities to collaborate. \" Featured on https://vimeo.com/hsctv/bbhi 14 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Principal Investigator Pamela Hall, PhD Assistant Professor, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Grant Name Apolipoprotein B and Control of S. aureus Quorum Sensing Grantor National Institutes of Health The Centers for Disease Control lists Methicillin-resistant Staphylococ - cus aureus (MRSA) as a top threat to human health and have called for a national strategy to combat it. At UNM, Pamela Hall, PhD, and her research team are doing their part, looking for a new way to defeat MRSA. It is an important battle. In the past, MRSA was known as a hospital-ac - quired disease, striking patients who have compromised immune systems. But even healthy people - from kids to pro-football players - can contract it. The past few years have seen the drug-resistant germs evolving faster and faster, Hall says. \"It is going to take a multi-level offensive to defeat MRSA, \" says Hall, an assistant professor in the College of Pharmacy's Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences. \"But if we can find the means to disarm the bacteria, then we can defeat them. \" Bacteria become drug-resistant when a few germs survive exposure to an antibiotic. Killing off their competition actually makes it easier for the remaining germs to multiply. Hall's lab is testing anti-virulence signaling strategies. If vaccines can be developed that block the bacteria's ability to recognize and com-municate with each other, they won't become activated and begin to colonize - meaning no infection to eradicate and no chance of resis-tance developing. Hall and her team have found that targeting virulence regulation sys- tems can actively protect from MRSA. The next step is gaining a better understanding of how the vaccine will perform against different types of MRSA. The stakes are high. A future without effective strategies to battle MRSA would mean a step back to the pre-antibiotic world, where even a small cut could be catastrophic. SIGNAL ACHIEVEMENT FINDING NEW WAYS TO FIGHT A DEADLY INFECTIONRESEARCH ANNUAL REPORT 2015 15 Principal Investigator Pavan Muttil, PhD Assistant Professor, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy Co-Investigator Dominique Price Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program Doctoral Candidate, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Grant Name Pulmonary BCG Immunization for Uniform Protection Against TB Grantor Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Grand Challenges Exploration;College of Pharmacy Dominique Price wants to wage a war on tuberculosis with a vaccine that works. \"I am extremely motivated, \" says Price, a postgraduate student in the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences. TB is one of the world's deadliest contagious diseases - 9 million people devel- oped the disease in 2009, and 1.5 million died from it - but most fatalities are preventable. The current injectable vaccine, known as Bacille Calmette-Guerin or BGG, is used in more than 100 countries, but it provides little protection in most hard-hit areas of the world, including Southeast Asia and Africa. \"It does not generate a strong immune response in the lungs, the prime region where we need the immune cells, \" says Pavan Muttil, PhD, an assistant professor in Pharmaceutical Sciences. \"We could treat the disease by giving a vaccine directly into the lungs, \" adds Muttil, the principal investigator of a study designed to develop a better TB vaccine. Price and Muttil's research suggests that the BCG vaccine's ineffectiveness is partly due to people's exposure to non-tuberculosis mycobacteria in soil and water. The body develops ways to \"compartmentalize immunity\" by triggering an im- mune response to some pathogens while avoiding a response to others that are not necessarily harmful to the body, Price says. But the mycobacteria, which belong to the same family as tuberculosis, confuse the immune system, rendering the injectable vaccine less effective. Price tested in mice whether a dry powderized form of the vaccine could provide better protection if delivered directly to the lungs. Mice exposed to mycobacteria got sick after receiving the current BCG vaccine through the skin. But when they received a vaccine via the lungs, the mice devel-oped an effective immune response. \"The mice were able to fight off the bacteria, \" Price says. \"That is really exciting. \" PROTECTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES INHALED TB VACCINE COULD SAVE MILLIONS OF LIVES Dominique Price Featured on https://vimeo.com/hsctv/price16 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER \"What I kind of do is put unusual things together, \" says Graham Timmins, an associate professor in the College of Pharmacy's Department of Phar - maceutical Sciences. It's a modest statement from a researcher who holds seven UNM-affil- iated patents that involve innovative technology to quickly diagnose tuberculosis and other lung infections. Another Timmins patent proposes a more effective treatment for TB, and yet another involves evaluating sunscreens for their protection against all potentially damaging solar radiation. His research focuses on using stable isotope-related compounds and free radical biology - the unusual things he puts together - to better diagnose and treat some common and deadly diseases. Asked which of those patents he is most proud of, Timmins groans. \"Ahh, \" he says. \"It's like which of your children do you love the most?\" Let's start with his rapid breath-test technology, known as the urease breath test. Ureases are bacterial enzymes that are expressed by many bacteria. \"If you look at serious lung pathogens, \" Timmins says, \"most of them have it. \" Timmins' stable isotope-labeled tracer compound, inhaled by a patient through a nebulizer or inhaler, fills the entire lung. It detects and identi-fies different infections upon exhalation - and does so within minutes. \"You can screen for tuberculosis, \" Timmins says. \"You can see if some - body's got pneumonia. You might be able to see the difference between viral and bacterial pneumonia. \" His rapid breath-test technology patents have led to the creation of a company, Avisa Pharma, headquartered in Santa Fe. The company has raised $8 million and its first clinical development is focusing on using TACKLING TB RAPID DIAGNOSTIC TEST SPEEDS TREATMENT Principal Investigator Graham Timmins, PhD Associate Professor, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Grant Name Pyrazinamide Breath Test for TB Grantor National Institutes of Health/ National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases RESEARCH ANNUAL REPORT 2015 17 Timmins's rapid breath test for TB with plans to expand research into pneumonia and cystic fibrosis. If there is a theme to Timmins' work, it is speed.\"What we're trying to do is have a very, very rapid screening test for TB so the whole thing could be over in five or 10 minutes, \" Timmins says. The fastest TB diagnostic test now takes three hours and the technology it uses is relatively un-portable. TB is most common in developing countries where transpor - tation is limited - it can take a full day for a patient to travel to a clinic or a clinician to travel to a rural area to conduct testing. \"With this, \" Timmins says, \"you could put everything in a backpack and you could just cycle to a village and test a whole lot of people. If somebody can be diagnosed and have their drug susceptibility determined in that single encounter, then you don't lose them to follow-up. That's a major improvement. \" The test, which has worked in 10 minutes in animal trials, could have a huge impact: the disease infects millions of people worldwide and results in 1.5 million deaths each year. \"Sometimes, \" Timmins says, \"it's just speed. You can poten- tially diagnose earlier in the processes, with the assumption that if you can intervene earlier there'll be a better outcome. \" Another of his innovations modifies an existing TB drug with stable isotopes to improve its infection-fighting effective - ness. \"It's very, very complex, \" Timmins says. \"It's taken me seven or eight years to figure it out. \"Yet another patent addresses the efficacy of sunscreens in protecting against melanoma. Sun Protection Factor rat - ings only measure protections against ultraviolet radiation, not all of the potentially damaging wavelengths. Timmins' patent involves analyzing a sunscreen for all the potential melanoma protection factors. And another involves using the breath test to rapidly di- agnose pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis patients. Once it is established, it's a very difficult infection to eradi-cate, but when caught early it can be eliminated. Timmins hopes the test will significantly improve the lives of some cystic fibrosis patients. Timmins, who joined UNM in 2001, has been recognized many times for his research accomplishments. In 2013 he received the STC.UNM Innovation Fellow Award thanks to his prolific record. While accolades and patents are prestigious and pharmaceu- tical companies may show profit, Timmins says the questions that underlie the research are his real motivators. \"The reason you do it is to get at these questions, \" Timmins says. \"Most smart people just like working problems. \"18 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Raj Shah with members of the Zuni Health Initiative Principal Investigator Jeanne Dalen, PhD Research Assistant Professor, Office of Pediatric Research Grant Name Adaptation and Evaluation of a Family-Based Mindful Eating Intervention for Overweight Adolescents Grantor National Institutes of Health /National Center for Complementary & Alternative Medicine Teenagers love high-tech gear, so it makes sense to use the latest gadgets to improve their health. But few studies have been done on using technology to motivate teens to become more active and lose weight, says Jeanne Dalen, PhD, research assistant professor in the Office of Pediatric Research. Dalen and her team studied three different brands of activity trackers - devices that record data such as steps taken, heart rate and calories burned. \"Researchers usually use these just to collect data, \" she says. \"We began to ask if fitness trackers are motivating in and of them-selves. \" The challenge is a major one: 35 percent of U.S. teenagers are over - weight and one in six has metabolic syndrome. In a recent study Dalen divided adolescents ages 11-16 into three groups. Each tested three different trackers for several weeks. \"We wanted to know if they would wear them and what they would like, \" Dalen says. \"Fitness trackers are beginning to be paired with mo - tivational websites, so people can really start to become engaged on a social level and on a motivational level, using computer technology. \" Dalen is also studying the effectiveness of a meditation-based mind- ful eating program for teens. \"This may represent a unique scientific approach to the current adolescent obesity epidemic, \" she says. Her team has identified an unexpected barrier to adolescent enroll- ment, though. \"We are seeing success once families are enrolled and begin to ex - periment with eating mindfully together at mealtime, \" she says. \"But sometimes the last thing a teenager is going to want to do is anything that their parent thinks is a good idea. \" Featured on https://vimeo.com/hsctv/dalenMOTIVATING MINORS HIGH-TECH HELP IN FIGHTING ADOLESCENT OBESITYRESEARCH ANNUAL REPORT 2015 19 VOLATILE SPIRITS EXPLORING THE LINK BETWEEN ALCOHOL AND PARTNER VIOLENCE Intimate relationships are complex, fueled by biology, chemistry, emotions, environment and upbringing. Mixing in alcohol with often contentious issues such as finances, child rearing or in-laws can quickly ignite domestic violence. Intimate partner violence is a big problem in the U.S. An estimated 22.4 million physi- cal assaults are committed every year, costing $6.2 billion in direct medical and mental health services alone. Investigator Brandi Fink, PhD, a KL2 Scholar in the Clinical & Translational Science Center, believes that alcohol-induced over-arousal plays a crucial role in heightening patterns of violence between couples. \"Fifty to 75 percent of partner violence incidents involve one or both partners under the influence of alcohol, \" she says. \"You can't study partner violence without studying the effects of alcohol. \" Alcohol-induced over-arousal reflects changes in heart rate, respiration, skin conduc - tance and brain responses that Fink hypothesizes play a crucial role in triggering partner violence. Fink's study compares the arousing effects of alcohol amid conflict, as well as the differ - ent responses in emotion regulation between violent and nonviolent partners.She's applying rigorous screening, interviewing and coding, precise demographic and psychophysiological data collection and EEG neuroimaging measures to her carefully selected sample. Current partner violence interventions rarely address alcohol use and can be tainted by cultural assumptions, Fink says. They often focus on males, based on the belief that the male is always the aggressor. \"In fact, there are over 200 studies that show both genders are equally violent, \" she says. \"And when only one partner is violent, it's more often the female. By blending psycholo - gy, psychiatry and clinical neurosciences research methods, we have teamed to scientifi-cally dissect this serious public health issue that destroys New Mexico families. \"Principal Investigator Brandi Fink, PhD Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Grant Name Overarousal as a Mechanism Between Alcohol Use and Intimate Partner Violence Grantor UNM CTSC; National Institutes of Health/ National Center for Research Resources; NIH/National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences 20 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER Every creature with a nervous system experiences discom - fort from time to time - but severe chronic pain presents a special kind of suffering. A multidisciplinary team of UNM researchers is tackling this problem with the help of a new, state-of-the-art laboratory that will help them pinpoint how the nervous system responds to potential therapies. \"We want to focus on pain mechanisms, \" says Hugh Mar - tin, MD, chair of the Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care, who spearheaded construction of the new facility. \"What are the deep-down neuronal injuries when you have a bone spur that constricts a nerve that comes out of the spinal cord?\" The Anesthesiology Pain Research Laboratory is specially equipped to examine the bio-distribution of novel pain drugs, says Erin Milligan, PhD, an associate professor in the Department of Neuroscience. An animal is admin - istered a candidate drug tagged with a radioisotope compound. Its tissues are sectioned into ultra-thin 5-micron slices that are imaged and digitally stored. When these images are overlaid with a radioisotope image using special software, scientists can create a 3-D picture showing how much of the drug has been absorbed and where in the body it is concentrated. Principal Investigators Hugh Martin, MD Chair, Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Erin Milligan, PhD Associate Professor, Department of Neurosciences Jeffrey Norenberg, PhD Professor and Director of Radiopharmaceutical Sciences Grant UNM Anesthesiology Pain Research Laboratory Grantor UNM Clinical & Translational Science Center RESEARCH RESOURCE AN INNOVATIVE TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING CHRONIC PAIN RESEARCH ANNUAL REPORT 2015 21 It's a big step toward developing a competitive program in the hunt for non-opioid alternatives for pain relief, Milligan says. \"We don't have anything in the Southwest like that. New Mexico would benefit tremendously from having a pain research center. \" This research traditionally has focused on nerve cells and how they communicate with one another, but Milligan is looking elsewhere. She is studying how, in chronic pain patients, pro-inflammatory immune cells flock from the site of an injury to portions of the spinal cord. \"These regions in the spinal cord are critical to pain processing, \" she says. She is testing BIRT-377, a drug that could block immune cells from triggering the inflammation that drives chron - ic pain. That's where Jeffrey Norenberg, PhD, comes in. A professor in the College of Pharmacy and an expert in pharmacodynamics, he has patented a radioiso - tope-tagged version of the drug. Norenberg is excited by the new lab's technical capabili - ties. \"It's the marriage of the equipment for collecting the slices to the software to the analysis that makes it state-of-the art, \" he says. \"You're not going to see anything like this. That's what makes it a very unique laboratory. \" In the new lab, he adds, \"We can do noninvasive in vivo imaging using functional probes. We can also drill down to the tissue and even cellular level in this lab. There are certain questions you can only answer when you get into a complex system. \" The lab is available to other UNM faculty who are studying neuro-immune conditions, Milligan says. \"They are very interested in dovetailing with Hugh's lab. It's going to be a very multidisciplinary research program. \" Meanwhile, the insights gained from collaborating with Martin and Norenberg help Milligan connect basic science research to patient needs, she says. \"We don't want to be in an ivory tower, \" she says. \"We really want to be one step from the clinic, all the time. What are the practical clinical problems that are observed in your patients on a routine basis? Hugh's clinical faculty tell me what's practical, what's not practical and what is desperately needed. \" 22 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER \"I am a woman on a mission, \" Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart says, recalling how a word of encouragement from an elder on the Stand-ing Rock Sioux Reservation in North and South Dakota set her on the path to earning her PhD in clinical social work. Decades later, Brave Heart, a research associate professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, is working to help heal American Indians suffering from historical trauma arising from centuries of genocide. She leads the Iwankapiya-Healing study. Funded by the National Institute of Mental Health, it compares a 12-week course of group in-terpersonal therapy (IPT) sessions with 12 sessions that combine IPT with the Historical Trauma and Unresolved Grief intervention that Brave Heart developed. The study takes place at a Northern Plains reservation and an urban Southwestern reservation outpatient be - havioral health setting. One example of historical trauma is the government policy, enforced as recently as the 1970s, of forcibly separating American Indian chil-dren from their parents and shipping them off to boarding schools. \"In the Dakotas, the boarding schools were notoriously abusive or perceived as abusive by people, \" says Brave Heart, who is Hunkpapa and Oglala Lakota. \"What we do is talk about the impact of boarding schools on our people and the traumas that emerge from that. \" Exposure to multigenerational trauma leads to heightened risk for a laundry list of emotional problems, Brave Heart says. \"PTSD, depres-sion anxiety, difficulty sleeping - all of those kinds of things are framed in reaction to this massive group trauma and how it's been passed on. \" Addressing this trauma in a therapeutic setting \"de-stig-matizes, \" she says. \"It communicates that you're not alone in this. \" Participants come to realize that what they're feeling isn't their fault, she says. It also yields understanding - and perhaps forgiveness - for one's parents, grandparents and great-grandparents. \"People are more open to looking at what's going on for them now. \" Principal Investigator Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart, PhD Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences Co-Investigator Josephine Chase, PhD Oglala Lakota College Grant Name Iwankapiya-Healing: Historical Trauma Practice and Group IPT for American Indians Grantor National Institutes of Health/ National Institute of Mental Healthcredit: State Historical Societies of North and South Dakota NATIVE WISDOM HELPING TO HEAL HISTORICAL WOUNDS RESEARCH ANNUAL REPORT 2015 23 Principal Investigator Elaine L.

Her research comes amid a virtual epidemic of violence against children. In 2012, 686,000 American children were victims of maltreatment and more than 1,600 of them died from abuse and neglect, accord-ing to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. In animal studies, Bearer showed that adverse experience can per - manently affect emotional circuitry. This may result from epigenetic changes, in which gene expression is altered without affecting the inherited DNA sequence. These changes involve a biochemical pro - cess called DNA methylation. Bearer's study suggests persistent stress changes children's brains. \"Traumatic experience appears to induce changes in the epigenetic pattern of DNA methylation in the brain, \" Bearer says. Bearer focused on methylation of the serotonin transporter gene, extending this analysis to subsets of the 1 billion potential methyl-ation sites in the human genome. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in regulating emotion. More than 25,000 methylation sites were significantly altered in children with autism, she found. Many of these changes could be detected in both saliva of living children and the post-mortem brains of children with autism. \"Eight percent of the altered methylation sites found in children correlated with altered sites in the brain, \" Bearer says. \"Saliva gives us a read-out of what's happening in the brain. \" The changes indicated abnormal gene expression that could inter - fere with the development of a young brain. With these promising findings, Bearer's goal is to discover biomark - ers that could help identify traumatized children early and channel them quickly into intervention programs. \"I would like to find a way to heal these children, \" she says.24 UNIVERSITY of NEW MEXICO HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER UNM Health Sciences Center researchers continually seek new cures and treatments to improve health and save lives. One sign of their success is the number of patents they receive: UNM ranks 42d in the world in number of patents issued, with UNM HSC accounting for a large part of the total. What is often overlooked is the economic empact of that research, which has led to 38 new business startups in New Mexico over the past decade, creating new jobs and boosting the state's economy. The pace of UNM HSC-related business development has been picking up in recent years, with four new ventures being launched in FY 2015, says Elizabeth Kuuttila, president and CEO of STC.UNM, the non-profit corporation chartered by the Board of Regents to promote technology transfer on behalf of the university. Albuquerque's Exovita Biosciences is developing technology pioneered by Kristina Trujillo, PhD, research assistant profes-sor in the Department of Cell Biology and Physiology, that uses exosomes - small, fluid-filled packets - to kill cancer cells without harming healthy cells. New Mexico-based terraSOL is honing analytical software created by Glen Murata, MD, professor in the Department of Internal Medicine, to improve care for people with chronic diseases. GHP Development, a Colorado company, has licensed a de - vice developed by Mark Hauswald, MD, professor emeritus in the Department of Emergency Medicine, that allows emer - gency room patients to safely control how much narcotic pain medication they receive. A new approach to automated flow cytometry is among sev - eral new UNM-developed technologies licensed to ieCrowd, a California biotech development group. The average salary for employees of these companies is generous - in the $70,000 to $80,000 range, Kuuttila says. It doesn't hurt that many of those hired by the firms were educated at UNM. \"It's great for the economy, \" she says, \"and it's great for our students, too. \" FROM BENCH TO BEDSIDE COMMERCIALIZING BIOTECHNOLOGY ONE STARTUP AT A TIME Elizabeth Kuuttila President and CEO, STC.UNM credit: MarbleStreetStudio .comRESEARCH ANNUAL REPORT 2015 25 Principal Investigator Stephen Hernandez, PhD, RN Assistant Professor, College of Nursing Grant Name Stress, Resilience, and Stigma and Barriers to Mental Health Care in Air Force Nursing Staff Grantor TriService Nursing Research Program If you were a soldier, how likely would you be to trust the person next to you if you knew he or she had recently been in counseling? If ordered into combat under the command of an officer with an anger problem, would you feel better or more un-easy knowing it was serious enough for him or her to seek counseling? \"Our military forces are highly trained and we don't want to lose them due to stress, \" says Stephen Hernandez, PhD, RN, assistant professor in the UNM College of Nursing. \"But traditionally, there has been a stigma to someone seeking out mental help. \" A major in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, Hernandez focuses on military service mem- bers' perceptions of stigma and barriers to care associated with seeking mental health services. An increasing number of research projects have addressed the issue in recent years, he said, but the well-being of medical caregivers themselves has been overlooked. How reluctant are they to seek services when they are overwhelmed, he wondered. In 2012, Hernandez launched a study that focused on health care providers at multi- ple Air Force bases. It found officer nursing personnel were significantly more likely than enlisted staff to believe accessing mental health services would be embarrass-ing, harm their career or cause leaders to blame them for the problem. Other barriers to seeking care included taking time off from work for treatment and scheduling appointments. A followup study is already in place. Ultimately, Hernandez says, the goal is to iden- tify effective interventions and decrease stress for medical personnel.
