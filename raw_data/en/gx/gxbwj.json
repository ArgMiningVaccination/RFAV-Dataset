Many have suffered from varying weather extremes this past season ranging from fire and drought to unseasonal cold and flooding. Here in Arizona, we have suffered from drought, causing the garden to struggle and lack its usual growth. A disappointment to say the least. But the thing about seasons is that they do change - we can move forward from what has happened to what can still be. So, despite our losses and dashed hopes for this year, we can move forward into autumn, reflect on the past, and plan for the future. With that in mind, new ideas and inspiration can be drawn from the upcoming NAHA conference in October! Discover what educational opportunities are available for aromatherapists through four fun-packed days of lectures and workshops, one of which I will be presenting myself on The Healing Garden: The Restoration of the Five Senses. Make sure to visit the conference website to keep up-to-date with speaker and event information as there are some great speakers you really don't want to miss! There is still time to purchase a ticket, if you are a last-minute decision maker! In this journal issue, we are looking at spice! Plants which produce aromatic spice oils and waters are usually warming, offering support to the digestive and respiratory systems. Tricia Ambroziak writes about a favorite spice, cinnamon ( Cinnamomom spp .), but looks more closely at its use as a hydrosol. Cheryl Murphy looks at the Zingiberaceae plant family which contains spices such as officinale ) and cardamom from that, I profile cardamom more deeply in its use as an herb, oil, and CO2 extract. Kathy Sadoswki reminds us about herbs we can easily grow in the garden and make herbal teas from. KG Stiles reflects on how spice oils can be used during the autumn of our lives, which might be a useful starting point if you are new to aromatherapy. Dawn Shipley writes about one of autumn's favorites, the pumpkin, and how it can be utilized as a carrier oil. On the business side, Kayla Fiovaranti revisits the subject area of labeling your aromatherapy products correctly, a topic that often causes confusion, but is one of great importance if you sell aromatherapy products. And finally, the NAHA directors have been generous once again to share with us a bumper harvest of autumn aromatherapy blends! Spice up your life this autumn with either our most recent journal issue - or by growing your aromatic community with friends old and new, along with timely aromatherapy topics, at the conference!

Aromatherapy NAHA Return to TopEssential Oils for the Autumn of Our Lives By KG Stiles The natural stages of human life have fascinat - ed mankind and been written about for millen - nia.\u00b9 As human beings, and as part of nature's life cycle, the analogy of the four seasons is often used when talking about the life cycles we experience as humans. For example: Spring: Spring is the first season of our life. It is the time between our birth and young adulthood. Summer: Next there is summer, the second season of our life. This is the time of our adulthood which encompasses family and career life. Autumn (Fall): Autumn refers to the third season of our life, and it is the time of mature adulthood. These are the years when we slow down and take time to enjoy our achievements. Winter: Finally, winter marks the fourth season of our life, the wisdom years. These are the years when we can experience being a crone or a sage. Each season of our life brings with it shared transitions and challenges we all must face. We can get stuck at any stage in our life. You may have experienced feeling trapped, even if momentarily, by a life challenge\u2014when our growth and development seemed to stop and we felt stagnant and stymied, unable to move forward. Essential oils can be a great tool when you need help to move through some of these life transitions and challenges. In this article, we will look at autumn and how essential oils can help with this third stage of life. When Autumn Leaves Begin to Fall - Letting Go! You enter the autumn season of your life when your individual responsibilities begin to decrease. The financial pressures of the householder years wane and the challenges of raising a family and demands of professional life slowly lessen. Maybe the children are off to college or are starting to make their own way in life. You may become a grandparent and retire from work life. Finally, you have time to enjoy travel you've long anticipated, or start pursuing avocational interests you've put on hold. For many this can be a time when you begin to contemplate the meaning of life. What is life all about? Did you achieve and experience everything you wanted to in your life? By the autumn season of life, you've faced many life challenges and overcome countless fears and limitations that threatened to hold you back from achieving your dreams. Hopefully, you've ripened and matured nicely and are like ripe fruit ready for the harvest. 10 Aromatherapy Journal Summer Autumn 2018.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to TopAt this stage you may realize life has a time limit and you have fewer years ahead of you than behind you. It's \"now or never\" you may think! The fall years of your life can be especially fruitful and full of spice if you allow them to be. You now have an opportunity to break free from the rules of society you may have followed for years that felt limiting and restrictive. Now society as a whole actually supports and even encourages you to take a break from the usual whirl of worldly commitments. You feel freed up to play and pursue your natural interests. Why People get Stuck at This Stage The summer season comes to its natural close once your life vision is realized. People can begin to feel old and worn out. They may come to the realization they've accomplished everything they wanted to in life. This season of life can be a time of crisis of identity and self-confidence. You may no longer know what to do with yourself as the rules of society no longer hold strong sway.\u00b2 Or, on the other hand, this can be a time of tremendous renewal when your enthusiasm for life gets reborn. Enthusiasm comes from the Greek word enthousiasmos which means \"possessed by a god, inspired or filled with spirit.\"\u00b3 The truth is the research shows that we can excel and do our best work at any age. Success in life correlates with being adaptable and open-minded. When faced with challenges success goes to those who collaborate and engage creatively with their \"allies\" and \"rivals\" to find the right way to do things. One sniff of an essential oil, a plant's essence, can almost instantly shift your mental attitude. It can help you to become more open minded and adaptable and to fill you with renewed enthusiasm for your life.

Purity matters. APRC, industry leader in essential oil aromaticplantRC 2018.3 NAHA Return to TopPumpkin Seed Oil By Dawn Shipley, Registered Aromatherapist I've always loved autumn; the change in colors, the spices and smells. And what would autumn be without pumpkins? Without jack-o- lanterns, the wafting scent of a pumpkin pie in the air, and memories made taking pictures in the pumpkin patch? And yet there is so much more to pumpkin! It is highly nutritional and versatile in both how it helps the body and ways it can be used. The most nutritionally-dense part of the plant is the seeds and the oil made from the seeds is no less impressive; it's placed among the top three nutritional oils along hemp ( Cannabis sativa) and flax (Linum providing the highest essential fatty acids (EFAs), which are required for healthy mind/ body functioning. 1 And to top it off, it's got a delightful slightly sweet nutty scent and taste, plus it has a nice, heavy viscosity that gives it a rich velvetiness that soaks in quickly, leaving skin soft and smooth. The Pumpkin Pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima , C. pepo), whose most common name means \"largest gourd\" in Latin, comes from the Cucurbitaceae family. 2 It's a grand species full of many squashes and some gourds that we know mostly for their culinary delectability, such as acorn squash, kabocha, and banana squash. 3 Cucurbita are herbaceous, frost-sensitive trailing vines bear - ing tendrils and large fruit. It is one of the most economically important genera of vegetable crops, with three species widely dis - tributed in cultivation.4 The Cucurbita maxi - ma can actually get up to a size exceeding 1000 lbs. (wow!), but it also grows as many different, smaller varieties of assorted shapes and sizes. This is because they are polymorphic, mean - ing there are several different forms among the members of the species.5 It's an ancient fruit, grown in the Americas for somewhere around 9,000 to 10,000 years, while it also made its way into Europe in the 17th century. 6 Extraction of pumpkin seed oil is done by cold pressing the cleaned, dried seeds. A seed yields 12% of oil.7 It is a dark reddish-green color,8 with a thick, viscous texture, and a slightly sweet taste. One very unique property of the oil is its dichromatic property. The oil shows two strikingly different colors of dark green (thinner layers) and a deep red (thicker layers). Pumpkin seed oil has the highest amount of dichromatism of any natural substance known! 9 It is an interesting phenomenon to experience. Put about \u00bc cup of oil in a small light-colored bowl and gently move it back and forth to see the dichromatism. Composition of Pumpkin and the Seed OilThe nutritive benefits of the pumpkin and its seed oil are lengthy. Pumpkin seed oil contains 16 Aromatherapy Journal Summer Autumn 2018.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to Tophigh levels of fatty acids that are necessary for a healthy mind and body, as previously noted; the most notable of those being oleic acid (up to 41.4%) and linoleic acid (up to 37%). Pumpkin seed oil also boasts the highest beta-carotene levels of all seed oils. 10 Zinc, vitamins B, C and E are also prevalent, along with phytosterols, which inhibit inflammation of prostate tissue,11 L-tryptophan, known to increase serotonin (and hence, mood), and six different phenolic acids. 12 One of the major characteristics of phenolic acids is their ability for radical-scavenging capabilities involved in anti-oxidant behavior. 13 And if it couldn't get any better, studies conducted in 2010 show that pumpkin seeds have even more benefits due to three bioactive compounds\u2014D-chiro-Inositol, Peptide (MW 8 kDa), and Moschatin that the studies to have anti-diabetic, anti-fungal and anti-carcinogenic properties, respectively. 14 The Wide Array of Health Benefits of Pumpkin Seed Oil Reading through the composition of pumpkin seed oil, you already have a good idea that pumpkin is amazing! Let's take a look at it from another angle\u2014the wide array of benefits: Anti-oxidant: Reduce oxidative stress in the body, known as a hallmark of various chronic diseases. 15 Anti-oxidants slow cell damage caused by free radicals, thought to boost overall health. 16 This also makes it great for the skin when used topically. Antimicrobial: Pumpkin concentration of 2.0 %.17 Anti-diabetic activity. 18 Increases energy/vitality: The B-vitamins in particular, and well-rounded general nutrient profile, are known to increase vitality. Healing to the digestive tract: The seeds were traditionally used for travel sickness, and it has laxative effects. Intestinal parasites are also inhibited.19 Increases heart health: Helps to lower cholesterol due to unsaturated fat content, and it has been shown to lower blood pressure in mice.20 Optimizes brain function, increases mood. Pumpkin Seed Oil continued Autumn 2018.3 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal17 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to TopPumpkin Seed Oil continued Aids urinary health: Generally, it has a positive effect on the urinary tract. It has even been seen to drastically cut down on bedwetting at night in one research study.21 It is also slightly diuretic, which in turn helps with urinary complaints. 22 Benefits prostate health: Decreases inflammation of prostate tissue, and even thought to help protect against prostate cancer.23 Aids in maintenance/improvement of sexual health. Helps to relieve effects of meno - pause: Found to help relieve or decrease some symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, joint pain, and headaches. 24 Maintains smooth skin: The emollient action, anti-oxidants and rich nutrient profile (especially beta-carotene) help to keep skin healthy, hydrated and smooth. Good for sores and ulcers. How to Use the Oil Most of the benefits listed above are achieved through internal use of the oil. It only takes a very small amount (a \"dessert\" teaspoonful a day per adult) to reap the health benefits. It also can be used topically for great skin benefits, making a wonderful massage or face oil. Do not heat the oil, and keep it refrigerated to keep it fresh. Cautions for Using the Oil There are no known contraindications for using the oil. However, it is important to buy from a reputable source to avoid adulteration with cheaper, refined oils. It is also important to keep the oil refrigerated. With refrigeration, the oil is hearty and rarely goes rancid. 25 Easy Healthy Dressing Ingredients: 1 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar 3 Tbsp. pumpkin seed ( Cucurbita maxima ) oil 1 clove garlic, crushed 1/2 tsp. black lava sea salt Use: Place all ingredients in a glass bowl then beat together with a fork for a few minutes. For best results, let the mixture sit for thirty minutes or overnight. Pour a small amount over salad to taste. Autumn Soothing and Stimulating Massage Oil Ingredients: 1 oz. pumpkin seed ( Cucurbita maxima ) ) Cautions: Avoid use with babies, children or while pregnant. Perform a patch test before use for people with sensitive skin. Be cautious of oxidation of yuzu essential oil - it could cause sensitization. 18 Aromatherapy Journal Summer Autumn 2018.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to TopPumpkin Seed Oil continued References 1.

There are fifty-two genera and about 1,300 species in this plant family. Most species are perennial and have creeping, horizontal or tuberous rhizomes (roots). Members of the Zingiberaceae family include plants that are commonly grown for ornamental, culinary (spices) and medicinal use. Some species, such as turmeric played a major role in Ayurvedic and herbal medicine for centuries. 1 The Importance of the Zingiberaceae Plant Family in Aromatherapy The Zingiberaceae plant family contains only a handful of species that produce an essential oil and are used in aromatherapy. Essential oils from this plant family are generally warming and good for pain, inflammation and digestive issues and have few contraindications.

Cinnamon as an Herb and a Hydrosol By Tricia Ambroziak, Certified Aromatherapist The sweet comforting aroma of cinnamon fills many homes especially during the fall and winter months. Cinnamon in the form of sticks, chips, and powder is used to flavor both sweet and savory foods and beverages in a wide variety of cuisines. But don't let its sweetness fool you. Cinnamon is also a multifaceted medicinal powerhouse. Cinnamon is the name of several species of trees whose fragrant bark is harvested for the spice. All are members of the Cinnamomum genus in the Lauraceae family and several are grown commercially to produce cinnamon. 1 Cinnamons and their Synonyms Cinnamomum cassia (a synonym of Cinnamomum aromaticum ) is the most common commercial type of cinnamon also known as cassia or Chinese cinnamon. Other species include: Indonesian cinnamon (Cinnamomum burmannii) Vietnamese cassia or .2As you can see cinnamon is a rather generic term for a spice that can come from a variety of species. Sometimes even the aromatic bark of unrelated species is ground and also sold as \"cinnamon.\" However, Cinnamomum cassia and Cinnamomum verum are most commonly sold for use in cooking and aromatherapy and this article will focus on those two species. As a spice, Cinnamomum cassia , sometimes labeled as cassia, produces a dark red, harder- to-grind cinnamon, and has single layered quills. Its flavor is typically strong and spicy, and it is well suited to baking. 3 Cinnamomum verum , sometimes labeled Ceylon cinnamon, is light brown in color, softer, and easier to grind and more expensive than cassia. Its quills are multilayer and crumbly. Its flavor is subtle and less aromatic than cassia. 3 When dealing with the herb, essential oil, or hydrosol from a quality company, the scientific name and plant part is specified. Since the chemistry varies between the leaf and bark as well as species it's important to know what's really in the bottle. C. verum and C. cassia (both leaves or bark) are generally used for medicinal purposes. Cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia)28 Aromatherapy Journal Summer Autumn 2018.3 \u00a9 Copyright to TopBotanical Description of Cinnamomum verum Cinnamomum verum is a tropical evergreen tree that grows from 8-18m in height (25-60 ft.). Its leaves are described as leathery and range from 11 to 16cm (4.5 to 6.25 inches) long with pointed tips. They are usually opposite and lanceolate to ovate and they are a gorgeous bright green color intermingled with splashes of red-tinged young leaves. Clusters of tiny, tube-like, yellow flowers hang drab and inconspicuous alongside the leaves. They yield a small, fleshy black berry which is 1 to 1.5 cm (0.25 to 0.5 in) in size when ripe. 4 C. verum originated in Sri Lanka and southern India and has been introduced to many other areas including Madagascar, East and West Indies, Central America, and Africa.5 As a tropical native C. verum prefers warm, humid conditions, and sandy soil. It is also commercially grown in Brazil and the Caribbean. The spice is obtained from the inner bark of the tree. Around the second year, the trees are cut back or coppiced to a stump and covered with soil. The trees then grow in a bush-like fashion the next year, with shoots bursting from the sides. These shoots are stripped of their bark and the peels set out to dry in the sun. While in the sun the bark curls into quills or sticks. Both the bark and leaves are distilled for essential oil and hydrosol production. 6 Botanical Description of Cinnamomum cassia Cinnamomum cassia is an evergreen tree originating in southern China. It is also widely cultivated in southern and eastern Asia. Much of the cassia comes from Indonesia and the tree is also grown in Vietnam, Burma, India, Malaysia, Taiwan, and Thailand. It grows from 10 to 15m (32 to 40ft) in height and it also has leathery, oblong to lanceolate leaves. The leaves reach about 10 cm (4 inches) in length and taper to a point. Clusters of white flowers adorn the tree and culminate in a purple-black berry about 1 cm (0.25 in) in size, surrounded by a cup shaped perianth. Like Cinnamomum verum , the spice comes from the inner bark of the tree and coppiced shoots are often harvested and dried to produce cinnamon quills. 7 A Brief History of a Long-Used Spice Cinnamon has a spicy history, so to speak. As one of the most prized and important spices of all time, its history is filled with myths surrounding its origin and tales of explorers and kings seeking to control its harvest and sale. Cinnamon was said to be found in the nests of the Phoenix and could only be collected when it fell from inaccessible rocks or trees on which the nests were built. Other myths suggested it grew in marshes but was guarded by a frightful clawed bat and winged serpents. These myths were solely to protect trade monopolies. Its source was kept a secret by those in the spice trade for centuries and, according to Pliny the Elder (23 AD - 79 AD), a Roman pound of cinnamon or cassia could cost up to 1500 denarii - about fifty months of wages. He disclosed its origins as \"the country of the Ethiopians\" and described its delivery around the Arabian Peninsula by rafts that took advantage of the trade winds. 8 Cinnamon was used by ancient nations for flavoring and preserving food. We now Spice is Nice! continuedAutumn 2018.3 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal29 \u00a9 to Topknow that cinnamon contains antimicrobial compounds and supports digestion, so it's no wonder it was not only valued for its scent and taste, but also for its ability to safeguard foods, cover the odor of spoiling food, and support digestive health. Cinnamon bark is mentioned by inference in several books of the bible and the Greek word \"Kinamomon\" appears in the book of Revelation. Scholars have no doubt it refers to Cinnamomum zeylanicum (synonym Cinnamomum verum ). The Hebrews found the scent glorious and used it as a perfume. 9 As early as 2000 B.C. there is record of cinnamon being imported to Egypt. It was regarded as a gift fit for royalty or even a deity. An inscription records the gift of the spice to the temple of Apollo at Miletus. 10 Cinnamon was used to embalm mummies and as part of aromatics used for burning. Given its antimicrobial properties it was useful for clearing the air of germs and imparting a pleasant scent. 11 During the early modern period (late 15th - late 18th century), the Dutch, Portuguese, and British had all established a stake in the cinnamon trade. Dutch traders established posts in Sri Lanka in 1638, took control in 1640, and expelled Portuguese traders by 1658. The Dutch East India Company overhauled methods for wild harvesting and began to cultivate their own trees but the British were also fiercely competitive in the spice trade. In 1767 Lord Brown established Anjarakkandy Cinnamon Estate on behalf of the British East India Company near Anjarakkandy in the Cannanore district of Kerala.12 This estate was the largest of its kind in Asia. By 1796 the British occupied costal areas of Sri Lanka (also referred to as Ceylon) with little difficulty and in 1802 the Dutch part of the island was ceded to Britain. 13 This period was riddled with conflict and war over the spice trade but ultimately gave way to a more peaceful production of cinnamon. Today the cultivation of cinnamon continues and the bark gathered for current supplies typically comes from highly pruned, cultivated plants. 14 Common in most kitchens, cinnamon is now readily available, used in a variety of cuisines, yet still prized for its aroma, taste, and medicinal benefits. Next time you reach into your spice cabinet and pull out cinnamon spice, think about the regal, mythical, adventurous past that brought this now cozy, humble spice into our homes. Therapeutic Uses of Cinnamon as a Herb Cinnamon is not only delicious and aromatic, it's beneficial for a wide variety of issues. Cinnamon bark has been employed in both Eastern and Western medicines for thousands Spice is Nice! continued Cinnamon (Cinnamomum cassia)30 Aromatherapy Journal Summer Autumn 2018.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to Topof years.15 As one of the first known spices its use is described in the Torah as an anointing oil and perfume for bedrooms along with aloe and myrrh. \"Then the Lord said to Moses, take the following fine spices:500 shekels of liquid myrrh, half as much...of fragrant cinnamon, ...of fragrant calams, 500 shekels of cassia ...and a hint of olive oil. Make these into a sacred anointing oil, a fragrant blend, the work of a perfumer. It will be the sacred anointing oil.\" 16 Traditionally a warming herb, cinnamon is one of the world's oldest tonic plants. Ancient writers and physicians Theophrastus, Herodotus, Galen, Dioscorides, Pliny, and Strebo each mention it in their writings. Chinese use goes back 5,000 years and it was used medicinally in Egypt, India, and Europe since around 500 BCE. 17 Cinnamon is recommended for a variety of digestive complaints, including spastic conditions, bloating, and sluggish digestion. Cinnamon also has a history of use in helping with excess bleeding, fibroids, and menstrual problems. Cinnamon has anti-microbial properties, which made it useful both as a food preservative and embalming agent. It is said to help with \"cold and debilitated\" conditions and may be useful against yeast infections. Both the herb and essential oil are key components of many germ-fighting blends. 18,19 According to Maud Grieve (1858 - 1941), \"It stops vomiting, relieves flatulence, and given with chalk is useful for diarrhea, and haemorrahage of the womb.\" 20 Hildegard of Bingen great power\" and \"it diminishes bad humors in who ever eats it often and brings good humors to the person.\" 21 In King's American Dispensatory cinnamon is described as \"stimulant, tonic, stomachic, carminative, and astringent; also reputed emmenagogue, and capable of diminishing the secretion of milk.\" And \"The tincture of bark is useful in uterine hemorrhage and menorrhagia...\" 22 Key constituents starch, sugars, coumarin. Cinnamomum cassia is rich in cinnamaldehyde, phenolic compounds, resins, sugars, coumarins, salicylic acid, anhydrocinnzelanol, anhydrozelanine, and carvacrol. 24 A 2014 review of the research on Cinnamo- mum zeylanicum and Cinnamomum cassia illustrates the numerous benefits of this plant. Cinnamon acts as an antioxidant, anti-inflam - matory, antimicrobial. Additionally, it 2018.3 to TopSpice is Nice! continued been found to have anti-cancer, anti-diabetic, lipid-lowering, and cardiovascular disease low - ering compounds, as well as activities against neurological disorders such as Parkinson and Alzheimer's diseases. 25 As you can see cinna - mon offers much to support wellness. Therapeutic Uses of Cinnamon as a Hydrosol You'll want to have cinnamon hydrosol on hand for the fall season. Like the essential oil it can be extracted from the leaf or bark. The chemistry of the oil differs between leaf and bark, and so one would expect the hydrosols would also vary. Cinnamon leaf produces oil high in the phenol eugenol (68.6-87%), followed and (E)-cinnamaldehyde (0.6-1.1%). the bark is rich in (E)- cinnamaldehyde (63.1-75.7%), with Analysis on the hydrosols is lacking but data from the Circle H institute indicates Cinnamomum cassia hydrosol has 34.8 mg/l of eugenol. 27 Although not specified, the chemistry suggests that the hydrosol was distilled from the bark. One would suspect hydrosol from the leaf would be rich in eugenol with lesser amounts of cinnamaldehyde. From my own experience cinnamon hydrosol is delicious! It smells and tastes like candy. It's sweet and spicy without being hot. I have only tried the hydrosol from the bark, but Catty says, \"the leaf hydrosol (is) sweet, yummy, just like the best cinnamon sweetie you've ever tasted.\" 28 She describes the flavor of the bark as more intense\u2014candy for grown ups. I agree with her assessment of the hydrosol being wonderful. Both the leaf and bark hydrosol are very stable and likely to last 18 to 24 months, if not more, when stored in cool, dark conditions. Cinnamon leaf hydrosol is balancing to the autonomic nervous system. One of Catty's clients used cinnamon leaf hydrosol for nearly a year during an intense court case. She found it gave her clarity and the ability to cope. 28 The hydrosol from the bark is stimulating. It's excellent to support focus or study, better than coffee says Catty\u2014but also delightful with coffee. Try using it as a spray to support back-to-school studies, or at work in the fall to usher in focus with a seasonal scent. Like the herb, the hydrosol is wonderful for the digestive system, relieving bloat and colic pains straight away. The essential oil has a reputation for killing infections of the digestive tract without harming beneficial flora. The hydrosol has similar, albeit less potent, effects. In her book Catty states that using both the essential oil and the hydrosol in synergy can reportedly achieve outstanding results. 28 Yarrow hydrosol, in combination with cinna - mon hydrosol, is said to help rebalance the en - tire digestive system.28 Catty is not specific in how to use this combination but suggests that when using hydrosols therapeutically add two tablespoons to a liter of water and consume daily for three weeks, then take a week off to 32 Aromatherapy Journal Summer Autumn 2018.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to Topallow your body to assimilate the changes. Reassess your situation and continue if nec - essary for further improvement.28 Of course, any internal use of essential oils or hydrosols should be done only under the supervised care of a qualified clinical aromatherapist or quali - fied holistic health care professional. Given its gorgeous scent and antimicrobial properties cinnamon hydrosol makes an excellent choice for use in green cleaning and to clear the air of germs - perfect for fighting back-to-school germs. The hydrosol also makes a refreshing mouth rinse and it is excellent for sweetening the breath. Perhaps tempting kids who are reluctant to brush with its sweetness. It's best to dilute hydrosols for children. A good starting point is 10% (5ml to 50 mls of spring water). Unlike other hydrosols cinnamon is not recommended for skin care and it should NOT be sprayed on the face. Given its antimicrobial properties it may be useful for cleansing cuts or scraps but, given its aldehyde content, it could potentially be irritating to the skin. Warm and comforting, cinnamon has long been treasured for its taste and many benefits. The herb once so rare, riddled with conflict, and fit only for royalty is now common in most kitchens. Whether you sprinkle the herb on Spice is Nice! continued Festive Fall Spray This festive spray is excellent to support focus, clear the air of germs, and promote the aroma of fall. You'll need a 2 oz. glass spray bottle to make this blend. Note: This is a spray for the environment, not a body spray. Ingredients: 1.5 oz. cinnamon ( Cinnamomum zeylanicum or cassia) leaf drops sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis) Directions for Use: Add the essential oil to the glass bottle. Add the solubol. Add cinnamon hydrosol and cap the bottle. Mix gently to combine. Spray as needed to support focus or fight germs. Avoid spraying directly on the face. Cautions: Avoid use of rosemary hydrosol with high blood pressure or during the first trimester of pregnancy. Refreshing Mouth Wash This aromatherapy mouthwash is natural, tastes great, and it is great for teeth and gums. You will need an 8 oz. bottle with a cap to make this blend. Hydrosols: 4 oz. cinnamon ( Cinnamomum zeylanicum or cassia) leaf or bark 3.5 oz. x piperita) 0.5 oz. myrrh Directions for Use: Combine the hydrosols in the glass bottle, cap, and shake gently to mix. Use \u00bd to 1 tsp. (2.5 - 5 MLs) after brushing, rinse, and spit. The hydrosol extracted from the leaf is less intense than that extracted from the bark. This blend can also be used to freshen breath throughout the day. Use within two weeks of making the blend. Cautions: Dilute to 10% for children. Hydrosols are very gentle but cinnamon is not recommended for use on the skin. Avoid getting on skin or in or near eyes.

However, it is one of those lesser known spices that made its way to the West and won our hearts with its warming and comforting aroma. A close relative of ginger (Zingiber officinale) , cardamom pairs with cinnamon (Cinnamom zeylanicum) in culinary dishes and compliments citrus and floral essential oils in aromatherapy blends. In herbal preparations, cardamom is used for teas, tinctures, and infusions. And it is now also available as a CO2 extract. Cardamom is a coveted ingredient in natural perfumery blends for its own accord of pleasing notes and its tenacious middle note. Cardamom is a plant that gifts us several extracts that can be used in a variety of ways for chilly autumn days. As in my previous articles on the Echinacea spp. published in the NAHA Aromatherapy Journal 2018.1 , and the Tilia spp. published in the NAHA Aromatherapy Journal 2018.2 , I hope to make this lesser known plant to aromatherapists more accessible and usable after reading this article. Botanical Profile Botanical Name: considered threatened. 1 Plant Characteristics: Cardamom is an herbaceous perennial.1 The plant is non- descript in that it is predominately a mass of leafy shoots, similar to its cousin ginger. It grows to a height of up to twenty feet. The seed (pods) are the part of the plant which is coveted for herbal and aromatic use. Flowers: The flowers are green in color and develop on a long flowering stalk. Flowers contain both male and female flowers. One of the striking features of the flowers is that one petal develops white in color, with a streak of violet.1 Lawless states that flowers can be yellow with purple tips.2 Cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum) : A Warming Spice for Autumn Days By Sharon Falsetto, BA (Hons) NAHA Certified Professional 2018.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to TopLeaves: The leaves are dark green, long, and lanceolate. Seeds: The seed pods are long, oval, and green-yellow in color.1 The seed pods develop after the flowers age. Each pod contains three compartments of tiny, aromatic seeds. The pods are not produced until after three years of growth.3 They dry out naturally but also require drying out in the sun before use.4 Plant Distribution: Cardamom is indigenous to southern India and Sri Lanka.4 However, it may be found in other tropical regions and can be cultivated in appropriate plant zones for personal use (see under Garden Profile ). Garden Profile Natural Habitat: The plant grows from either a thick rhizome (root) or seeds. It needs shade and moist, rich soil to flourish. 4 Its natural habitat is the floor of the forest in its native region. How to Grow from Seed/Root: In the appropriate climate, cardamom can be grown from seed, sown directly into the ground. It can also be grown in a greenhouse, with care, but it requires a minimum temperature of 35 degrees F. 3 It appears that cardamom is a sensitive plant which will not flourish without the right growing conditions: A tropical-like climate with a lot of shade. It is also possible to grow cardamom from the rhizome, which produces earlier fruit (and seed pods).1 Plant Zones: 10 - 13.3 Garden Benefits: Cardamom is not a natural choice to attract pollinators and other beneficial creatures to the garden but if you live in its preferred climate, it will add a spicy element to your aromatic garden!Historical Use Cardamom has traditionally been used in Ayurvedic medicine 1 and it has also been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine.2 Its uses included digestive and urinary problems, in addition to the treatment of fever. The ancient Greeks used cardamom as both a spice and a medicine as early as 4 th century BC.4 According to Lawless,2 Hippocrates (460 - 370 BC) recommended cardamom for \"sciatica, coughs, abdominal pains, spasms, nervous disorders, retention of urine and also for bites of venomous creatures.\" When is Cardamom not Cardamom? Do not confuse Elettaria These are often termed by the common name of cardamom but are not the same as Elettaria cardamom . Learn the correct botanical name to purchase the right type of cardamom for your use.Cardamom: A Warming Spice for Autumn Cardamom 2018.3 Return to TopCardamom: A Warming Spice for Autumn Days continued In Medieval times, cardamom was a popular import of the spice trade. The Arabs used it extensively as a flavoring in coffee.5 Cardamom is one of the most expensive spices in the world. Proof of its value can be traced back to ancient times when it was listed as a commodity subject to duty in Alexandria in 176 AD. 6 If further proof is needed of the importance of cardamom in a historical context, you will find many references to it as the Queen of Spices, just as black pepper (Piper nigrum) is referred to as the King of Spices. Chemistry Profile Cardamom (the plant) contains alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, sterols, and oil. 4 According to Mabey,7 constituents of the plant can contain between three to six percent of volatile oil which contains terpene and terpineol. The essential oil of cardamom is said to be \"a rich source of the compound 1,8 cineole...\" 8 Other research shows that the essential oil contains \"1,8-cineole (45.6 %), -terpinyl acetate (33.7 %), sabinene (3.8 %), 4-terpinen-4-ol (2.4 %), and myrcene (2.2 %), respectively.\"9 Finally, Rhind describes cardamom essential oil as having up to 50% of 1,8 cineole, 24 - 40 % of -terpinyl acetate and 6% of limonene, with other minor constituents.10 Perfume Profile It is worth mentioning cardamom's aromatic profile under a separate heading in this article as it can vary depending on the type of extract. The essential oil is described as \"warm and spicy, with a slight camphoraceous/cineolic nuance in the top note.\" 10 Aromatherapists and natural perfumists alike love it with regard to its aroma as it is an extremely tenacious oil for a middle note. This means that it will hold well in an aromatic blend of complimentary oils. With the increasing availability of CO2 extracts now available to aromatherapists (and natural perfumists), it is interesting to compare the aroma of cardamom essential oil to that of the CO2 extract. The total CO2 extract of cardamom (which is closer to the aroma of the actual plant but closer in its liquidability to that of an absolute, but without the use of chemicals) is also rich, and warm, but more balsamic and woody on the dry down. It is closer in aroma to the smell of the cardamom pods, if that is the aroma you are looking for, rather than the more camphoraceous top note of the essential oil. Therapeutic PropertiesTherapeutic actions of cardamom in herbal medicine include: Indigestion, irritable bowel syndrome, flatulence, asthma, and bronchitis. 4 It is also thought to be an aphrodisiac. Tierra, in his book The Way of Herbs, 11 states that cardamom can be used for diarrhea, colic, and headaches. He also comments that it is excellent in Chai tea. Cardamom essential oil can be used for infections, congestion, asthma, inflammation (respiratory), stress, anxiety, mental fatigue, and as an aphrodisiac.10 In summary, cardamom can be used primarily for digestive and respiratory disorders, and as an aphrodisiac.40 Aromatherapy Journal Summer Autumn 2018.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to TopNote that the amount of dosage, and the method of administration, of cardamom may affect the degree of success in addressing each of these problems. Ways to Use Cardamom Some of the ways in which cardamom can be used are: Essential oil (steam distilled from the seeds) CO2 extract Tea infusion Infused oil Tincture/glycerite. Cardamom is also extensively used as a spice in culinary dishes, both savory and sweet (Indian curry, cakes, bread, and coffee). Conclusion Cardamom is a difficult, although not impossible, plant to grow in most of the United States and the rest of North America. However, cardamom is available as a number of extracts from reputable suppliers, to use both as a purely aromatic indulgence, and for its herbal and aromatherapeutic properties. Cardamom pods are available for purchase to make teas, infusions, and tinctures, in addition to the essential oil for aromatherapy blends. Cardamom mixes well with other aromatic spices for a warming, autumnal blend, topped off with a citrus or floral note.Cardamom: A Warming Spice for Autumn Days continued Cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum)Breathe Easy Oil Use this blend to relieve the congestion of autumn chills and colds.

It is both fresh and convenient; just walk out to the yard, trim and rinse some herbs, add hot water, and brew for a few minutes! Growing the Plants There are many herbs that will grow easily, if given proper sun, water, and soil. Plants of the Lamiaceae family, like mint ( Mentha cataria) can even overgrow to the point of becoming invasive to the other plants in your garden! Many herbs can be planted in pots to reduce spreading. This also makes them portable, thus they can be moved to a location with a better amount of sun or brought inside if the temperature dips too cool. When growing herbs for culinary and medicinal use, it is very important that they are not exposed to pesticides or pollutants that would render them unsafe to ingest! Harvesting Harvesting can begin when the plant has enough leaves to maintain growth. Most herbs are quite hardy, so they can be cut back up to 50% without harm. LEAVES should be harvested before the plants begins flowering (such as basil (Ocimum as once the plant flowers, the leaf chemistry changes, and the flavor lessons or becomes more bitter. Lengthen leaf harvest time by cutting back flowers as they start to appear. FLOWERS like lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile, Matricaria recutica) and rose ( Rosa spp.) should be harvested while they are young and have just begun to bloom. STORAGE of freshly harvested bunches of herbs can last about a week in the refrigerator. Place stemmed bundles up to 4 -12 inches tall in a glass with about an inch or two of water and refrigerate. Making Aromatic Teas from Herbs Growing in the Garden By Kathy Sadoswki LMT, RYT, Registered Aromatherapist 48 Aromatherapy Journal Summer Autumn 2018.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to TopPreserving Dried herbs can offer delicious flavor into the winter months, when the garden has become dormant. Properly dried and stored in a sealed container in the cupboard, the herbs should last about a year. Herbs can be dried by air or in the oven. Air Drying Herbs Harvest herbs by cutting stems to about 4- 12 inches in length. Gently rinse, and then pat the cuttings dry with a paper towel or cloth. Make small bundles, tied in a way to allow air flow around the herbs. Dry in a warm, dry, ventilated area. Dry hanging upside down or put the bunch in a brown paper lunch bag, stems facing outward. Bagging prevents dust and debris from collecting on the drying herbs. Once completely dried, remove leaves or flowers from stems, and place desired parts in a sealed container and store in cupboard, out of sunlight. Oven Drying Leaves and Flowers Gently rinse, and pat dry any excess moisture from the harvested herbs. Place the herb cuttings in a single layer on glass (such as Pyrex\u00a9 or Corningware\u00a9) dishes. Turn the oven to the very lowest setting (100 - 150 degrees Fahrenheit is best). Set the herbs in the oven, leaving the oven door slightly open to maintain a temperature under 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Heat for about three hours, depending on the herb. Turn the herbs and begin drying the other side after about an hour. Check progress often; do not overheat as flavor, aroma, and color will be lost. Once completely dried, but not overheated, take the herbs out of the oven and allow to cool. Put dried herbs in sealed containers, and store in cupboard, out of sunlight. Preparing Herbs For Tea There are a few things to keep in mind before preparing home grown herbal teas. Firstly, respect that herbs have medicinal qualities which can be very helpful, but just like essential oils, should not be taken in excess. As a general rule, a safe adult amount is up to three cups of infused tea per day (each cup made with 1 tsp. of dried herbs or 2 tsp. of fresh herbs). Like essential oils, herbs also have contraindications and safe amount guidelines to investigate before using. Possible contraindications for the herbs listed in this paper came from Catherine Ulbricht's Natural Standard Herb & Supplement Guide . 1 Unlike essential oils, that can be specifically analyzed Making Aromatic Teas from Herbs continued Sage (Salvia officinalis)Autumn 2018.3 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal49 to Topfor precise chemical make-up, herb growing at home yields a less definitive product. When harvesting herbs, assess appearance, aroma, and flavor before preparing teas. Steeping Time Heavier plant parts like roots, seeds, and coarse bark such as cinnamon sticks, star anise, and black pepper, are generally added to boiled water and simmered for 10- 20 minutes. Lighter plant parts such as leaves should be infused in water that is slightly less hot than boiling for 6-9 minutes. Very delicate plant parts such as blossoms and flower petals should be steeped in hot water that would not burn the finger for 3-5 minutes.Helpful Hints Use spring or distilled water. Use about 1 tsp. of dried herbs or 2 tsp. of fresh herbs per eight ounces of water. Do not use aluminum or iron pots to brew herbs. Strain loose herbs immediately after diffusing. Avoid over-steeping, which can bring out a bitter flavor. For a stronger flavor, use more herbs instead of steeping longer. OR - crush or mince fresh herbs before infusing to bring out a stronger flavor. For iced tea - allow strained brew to cool before pouring over ice.Making Aromatic Teas from Herbs continued Top Row, Left-to-Right: Basil (Ocimum basilicum), Lemon balm 2018.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to TopSome Herbs that Grow Easily and Which Are Great for Making Tea Sage ( Salvia officinalis) GROWTH - Many species varieties are available.

Many have claimed that essential oils should fall under the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) drug category; however, I can make a good case against that hope. It is important that as aromatherapy, and hence cosmetic, companies, that we clearly stay on \"our side of the line\" and don't walk the tightrope between the cosmetic and drug definitions. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA): Intended Use Let's talk first about the role the FDA plays in cosmetics. The FDA has authority over cosmetics, meaning that the FDA regulates cosmetics, but they do not pre-approve or approve any cosmetic or aromatherapy product. As of right now, they do not require current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) to be followed. FDA approval or pre-approval falls solidly within the FDA role in drugs, but not in cosmetics. The intended use of an aromatherapy product determines whether it falls under a cosmetic or a drug claim. Claims that are made on the packaging of products, on social media, websites, consumer reviews, or any form of advertising that can sway what the consumer believes the product will do can change how the FDA views the intended use of a product. To navigate the concept of intended use it is vital to know how the FDA defines a cosmetic and a drug. According to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) cosmetics are \"articles intended to be rubbed, poured, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human body or any part thereof for cleansing, beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering the appearance [FD&C Act, sec. 201(i)].\" 1 When it comes to drugs, a cosmetic can be classified as a drug if claims make the intended use \"for therapeutic use, such as treating or preventing disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body.\" 2 Cosmetics have simple labeling regulations, and voluntary adverse effects reporting. You cannot make any claims other than cosmetic usage, even if it is accurate or nature's wonder \"drug.\" The Cosmetic Legality Principle does not require pre-market approval or notification of products or ingredients, clearance of products safety, or substantiation of product performance claims (moisturizing, cleansing, deodorizing, etc.). \"This principle also holds true for 'essential oils.' For example, a fragrance marketed for promoting attractiveness is a cosmetic. But a fragrance marketed with certain 'aromatherapy' claims, such as assertions 58 Aromatherapy Journal Summer Autumn 2018.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to Topthat the scent will help the consumer sleep or quit smoking, meets the definition of a drug because of its intended use. Similarly, a massage oil that is simply intended to lubricate the skin and impart fragrance is a cosmetic, but if the product is intended for a therapeutic use, such as relieving muscle pain, it's a drug.\" 3 Adulterated and Misbranded Products The manufacturer of a product is responsible for making sure that cosmetics are safe and that they are not adulterated or misbranded. Adulterated is defined as harmful or injurious to a user under customary conditions of use such as microbiology, unapproved color additive, chemical contaminant or prohibited ingredient. 4 Misbranded is defined as when labeling is false or misleading; the package does not exhibit labeling information required by statute or regulation; packaging is not in compliance with 1970 Poison Prevention Packaging Act (PPPA); or the packaging lacks requires information. 5 International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) All cosmetic ingredient lists are required to be listed with the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) names on the finished product. They must be listed in descending order. The use of trade or common names alone is not allowed on cosmetic ingredient lists. International standardization to ensure consumer safety worldwide means that we can't just put everything into basic English. Examples of International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) Example of an Essential Oil Blend with Ingredients Listed in Descending Order If you made an essential oil blend with 15 drops of lavender, 12 drops of lime, and 5 drops of patchouli and sold it as an essential oil blend the label would need to read: Lavandula angustifolia essential oil, Citrus aurantium essential oil, Pogostemon cablin essential oil. For consumers you could add the common names in parenthesis. For example, the same blend could be listed: Lavandula angustifolia (Lavender) essential oil, Citrus aurantium (Lime) essential oil, Pogostemon cablin (Patchouli) essential oil. Example of an Ingredient List for Lotion This is an example of a lotion ingredient list.

The FDA suggests that a brand can reduce the risk of adulterated or misbranded cosmetic products if they manufacture the product by following cGMP, although this is a voluntary practice. 6 On the other hand, drugs are highly regulated and do require pre-clearance by the FDA, and cGMP is required. Drugs have highly regulated labeling laws (i.e. Drug Facts). They require reporting of all and any adverse effects which are known, and they are allowed to make proven, specific, and tested claims that follow the monographs requirements. In the Drug Legality Principle, a product meets the definition of a drug if it complies with ALL of the requirements for drugs (even if it also meets the definition of cosmetic). All cosmetics that meet the definition of a drug have to be registered and regulated by the FDA. A product is considered a drug if it makes claims such as being a sunscreen, antibacterial soap, anti- dandruff shampoo, anti-acne, anti-wrinkle, antiperspirant, etc. 7 While your product may be the be-all and end-all of natural cures you simply cannot make that claim because your intended use claims will convert your aromatherapy cosmetic product into a drug. Examples of drug products intended use include: antiperspirant (stops perspirations) dandruff shampoo (treats dandruff) sunscreen/suntan preparation (prevents sunburn) fluoride toothpaste (prevents cavities) skin protectants (helps heal cuts).Examples of cosmetic products intended use include: deodorant (cover up odor) shampoo (cleanse hair) suntan preparations (moisturized while tanning) toothpastes (cleans teeth or freshens breath) skin protectants (moisturize skin). Three Types of Claims that Can Cause Your Cosmetic to be a Drug 1. Claims that suggest physiological change. For instance, if you say, \"younger looking\" rather than \"younger\" it is a cosmetic. If you say \"removes\" or \"prevents\" wrinkles, rather than \"covers\" your product is a drug. 2. Claims that sound scientific. For instance, if you claim that your soaps are \"Compounded in our laboratory under the most sterile conditions,\" or \"If blemishes persist, see a doctor,\" your product is a drug. 3. Claims that appear in an applicable Over-the-Counter (OTC) monograph such as sunscreen products, hormone products, acne, eczema, psoriasis, skin bleaching, etc. Even implied claims by known effects of ingredients can turn a cosmetic product into a drug product. For example, in skin bleaching products, the presence of many ingredients automatically makes the product a drug. Remember that even if a cosmetic has a drug action, it must qualify as a drug first and then as a cosmetic.The Definition of Aromatherapy continued60 Aromatherapy Journal Summer Autumn 2018.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to TopSummary The trick is this: It doesn't matter whether the claim is true or not, it's whether the claim transforms the cosmetic into a drug. You might know that your aromatherapy product helps to lighten hyper-pigmentation, your ointment helps to cure eczema, your serum irons out wrinkles, but as soon as you state or imply that fact on your label, in your literature, in any print advertisement, on your website, or anywhere, you are placing your product into the drug category. Therefore, you must follow all drug regulations and present your product to the FDA before it hits the market. You will also need to present case studies to the FDA to back up your claim. A few marketing ploys that can get you in trouble and alert knowledgeable consumers that you don't know the laws of the industry include: Making claims that your product is FDA approved or that your facility is an FDA approved facility, making product claims based on known effects of ingredients, unsubstantiated endorsements (such as Celebrity Infomercials) or product reviews, including a disclaimer such as \"results may vary\" or \"not typical for the average consumer.\" In addition, using the term \"cosmeceuticals\" for your product is a big red flag because a product can be defined as a drug, cosmetic, or a combination of both following the rules of both standards, but the term \"cosmeceutical\" has no meaning under the law. 8 Just because you see another company making claims does not mean that you should do it. If the FDA looks into your claim, you can't use another company's bad judgment as an excuse for your choices. And you don't know if the other company is actually complying with the law since much of it is behind the scenes, with the exception of \"drug facts\" on the label. Essential oils fall solidly under the FDA's cosmetic definition and that is a good thing. Claims can cause a product to be classified as a drug with the FDA, which would make a company out of compliance. As a cosmetic formulator who has worked on over-the-counter (OTC) sunscreen products, I would rue the day that essential oils become over- the-counter (OTC) drugs. The cost, paperwork, and red tape of essential oils becoming an OTC drug would most likely put 99.9% of us out of business.The Definition of Aromatherapy continued Autumn 2018.3 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal61 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to TopReferences: 1.

Essential Oils: 200 drops sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis) 100 drops cinnamon bark for Making and Use: Mix together the essential oils in a glass bottle with an orifice reducer. Diffuse drops of the blend (according to manufacturer's guidelines) with a nebulizer, ultrasonic machine, potpourri or wax warmer, light bulb ring, etc. Annette's Tip: This delightful, spicy blend will fill your home with the aroma of pumpkin pie and spice bread while purifying the air. Cautions: The blend may harm wood finishes and plastics. This blend is not intended for topical use unless highly diluted in a carrier (maximum 1% blend in 99% carrier base). May irritate sensitive skin. Avoid eye area and mucous membranes. Keep out of reach of children and pets. NAHA Directors are both diverse and knowledgeable in their various areas of aro - matherapy expertise! Here is a roundup of some of their favorite Autumn recipes! Autumn Recipes Contributed by NAHA Directors Frankincense Coffee By Robin B. Kessler, CA (New Jersey) Ingredients: 1 tsp. ground powder* frankincense (Boswellia sacra) 1 organic empty tea bagYour coffee of choice1 Tbsp. vanilla almond milk or regular milk Directions for Making and Use: *To make the powder: Take tears of frankincense and grind them down using a mortar and pestle or by using a coffee grinder. Make sure that you put the tears in the freezer the day before. They must be frozen in order for you to grind it or it will get too sticky and you will not be able to grind it up. Take one tsp. of the ground powder and put it into the teabag. Make the coffee in your usual way. Put the teabag into the cup. Let it steep for about 3-5 minutes until you smell the frankincense aroma. Add stevia (if desired) and a Tbsp. of milk to the cup. Slowly sip it and feel your whole body relaxing! Robin's Tips: Frankincense is grounding and relaxing. If you cannot drink caffeine at night, then make the recipe with decaffeinated coffee.Autumn 2018.3 NAHA's Aromatherapy Journal63 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to TopAutumn Recipes continued Nourishing Hair Oil Treatment By Valerie Cooksley, RN, OCN, dulcis) oil 1 vitamin E oil capsule ( optional) Essential Oils:10 - 20 drops essential oil of your choice (my personal favorite is rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis )) Directions for Making: In a small glass bottle, add the vegetable and nut oils. Add the vitamin E if using it by cutting off the end of the capsule and squeezing the contents into the bottle. Add your essential oil and mix well. Directions for Use: Apply the blend to your hair and cover with a hair cap. Leave on for a minimum of 20 minutes or longer if desired. Valerie's Tips: I recommend this recipe as a wonderful Hot Oil Treatment for treated or damaged hair. Gently warm the bottle of oil in a hot water bath. This can be easily done by placing it inside of a small bowl of very hot water and creating a water bath. I do not recommend microwaving. Apply while in the bath soaking, or you can smear it on at the beach while sun bathing (just be sure not to use phototoxic oils!).

After cleansing face and neck, spray the toner onto a cotton pad and gently wipe face and neck in an upward motion. Apply moisturizer of choice afterwards if desired. Jaime's Tips: Use an amber or cobalt blue colored glass spray bottle and store in the refrigerator. Cautions: Avoid use near eye area. Avoid use if you have low blood pressure. Avoid use if pregnant or breast feeding. Do not use on open skin areas. Discontinue use if skin irritation occurs. Do not confuse cold pressed carrot oil with steam distilled carrot seed essential oil. 64 Aromatherapy Journal Summer Autumn 2018.3 \u00a9 Copyright 2018 NAHA Return to TopAutumn Recipes continued Autumn Spice Foot Soak By Jennifer Hochell NAHA Vice President orange ( Citrus sinensis) Directions for Making and Use: Combine Epsom salt, shredded ginger and crushed anise seeds in a bowl. Add in the essential oils and mix well. Pour the salt mixture into a foot soak tub and add warm to tolerable hot water. Soak feet for 15-20 minutes. Jennifer's Tips: A great blend to rejuvenate tired feet, stimulate circulation, and nourish your sole! Cautions: If you have an allergy to any of the ingredients omit these ingredients from the recipe. Those taking blood thinners should use caution and/or omit cinnamon from this recipe.
