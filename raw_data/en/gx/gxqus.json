In part, this renewed curiosity is probably due to the revolutionizing natural movement in the cosmetic industry. In this article, we provide an overview of the historical aspects of the use of natural ingredients in cosmetics, which mostly come from botanical and mineral sources. We begin with an introduction to the art and science of cosmetics in the ancient world, which includes accounts of Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greek, and Roman cosmetics as well as Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic Medicine. These dermatological and cosmetic practices, which were advanced for the time, paved the way for the current revolution of natural ingredients in cosmetic products. Without providing a comprehensive historical account, we surveyed selected cultures during different periods of time to provide some perspective of our current understanding of natural ingredients in cosmetics. Attention is also given to the rich contributions of body art by tribal societies to our knowledge base, especially in the areas of dyes and pigments. Finally, we offer some perspective of natural ingredient cosmetics in the Information Age.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-04-29", "cleaned_text": "History of Natural Ingredients in Cosmetics [https://doi.org/10.3390/cosmetics10030071](https://doi.org/10.3390/cosmetics10030071) Abstract: 1. Introduction 2. Egyptian Cosmetics [1](#B1-cosmetics-10-00071), [2](#B2-cosmetics-10-00071), [3](#B3-cosmetics-10-00071), [4](#B4-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Ahead of their time, the Egyptians were sophisticated cosmetic chemist formulators. Bathing was a part of their daily life, with most Egyptians bathing at home or in the river. Cleansing cream was made of animal fat or vegetable oil mixed with powdered lime and perfume. Oils and creams were used for protection against the harsh sun, wind, and dry climate. The lips and cheeks were treated with red ochre ground in water. People rubbed themselves daily with perfumed unguent oil that was soaked in scented wood. Perfumes were made of myrrh, thyme, marjoram, chamomile, lavender, lily, peppermint, rosemary, cedar, rose, aloe, olive oil, sesame oil, and almond oil [ [1](#B1-cosmetics-10-00071)]. The use of perfume had a very spiritual significance and was believed to optimize body function. Fingernails and the palms of the hands were treated with henna, producing an orange-red tone. In general, the variety of pigments based on natural minerals used by the ancient Egyptians for cosmetics is impressive [ [5](#B5-cosmetics-10-00071), [6](#B6-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [7](#B7-cosmetics-10-00071)]. It is a dark cosmetic applied to the eyebrows, eyelashes, and perimeter of the eye. The wall painting displayed in [Figure 1](#cosmetics-10-00071-f001)clearly demonstrates the use of kohl by the ancient Egyptians. Analysis of samples from burial excavations provided evidence that green kohl was used in predynastic times (5000-3000 BC) with the principal ingredient being malachite ore (basic copper carbonate; Cu2(OH)2CO3). In the Egyptian dynastic periods (3100-30 BC), kohl often contained galena ore (lead sulfide; PbS) as the most abundant ingredient, which provided a black color [ [8](#B8-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Throughout history, it was presumed that black kohl was predominantly made of stibnite (Sb2S3), a rarer mineral which gives a similar tone as galena ore. While stibnite has been found in excavated kohl samples, galena ore was more common. This misconception might stem from the use of the Latin word stibium for kohl or possibly the reference to stibnite in ancient Muslim texts as the proper ingredient for formulating kohl [ [9](#B9-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Often, minor components in kohl consisted of other lead-based compounds, such as phosgenite ((PbCl)2CO3) and laurionite (PbCl(OH)), which provided lighter tones to the resulting formula. Long chain fatty acids of animal origin were also found in kohl compositions. Although less prevalent, magnesium oxide (MnO2) and brown ochre/iron oxide (Fe2O3 \u00b7 nH2O) were also used as primary kohl ingredients. Later in history, kohl made from soot was more frequently used. See [Figure 2](#cosmetics-10-00071-f002)for an illustration for some of the minerals that were used in Egyptian cosmetic preparations. [8](#B8-cosmetics-10-00071)]. It should be noted that compounds containing lead are toxic and can enter the blood circulation by inhalation, ingestion, and percutaneous absorption. Lead compounds bioaccumulate in the body and are significantly more toxic to infants and children than to adults. They can cause intellectual disabilities, loss of hearing, and various other ailments. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not approve the use of kohl products due to the presence of lead-based compounds. However, there are products that are labeled as kohl in the U.S., although in this case, kohl is a marketing term that is used to describe extremely dark shades of eyeliner. [10](#B10-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Since the Egyptians used stone to grind wheat into flour, it is very likely that sand from the stones damaged enamel and other structural elements of the tooth [ [11](#B11-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Most archaeological evidence suggests that the Egyptians suffered from tooth decay, tooth loss, and dental abscesses. Interestingly, the earliest recorded dentist in the world was the Egyptian Hesy-Ra who lived during the Third Dynasty (First Dynasty of the Old Kingdom\u20142600 BC) [ [12](#B12-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Chewing sticks and wood have been used throughout history to clean the teeth. However, the ancient Egyptians are often credited for the first written recording of a toothpaste formula (ca. fourth century BC) containing a mixture of salt, pepper, mint leaves, and iris flowers [ [13](#B13-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Historically, salt and ash were used in dentifrices as abrasive ingredients serving a similar function as silica in today's modern-day preparations. Ironically, several commercial brands available on the market today contain salt as one of the principal ingredients. Most texts describe the first mints made by the Egyptians as containing frankincense, myrrh, and cinnamon, which were boiled with honey and shaped into pellets. [14](#B14-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Other ingredients often described in the literature include myrrh, thyme, marjoram, chamomile, lavender, lily, peppermint, rosemary, cedar, rose, aloe, olive oil, sesame oil, and almond oil [ [1](#B1-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Perfumes from this period were fat-based, since modern techniques of preparation based on distillation were not discovered until later. Therefore, perfumes often contained animal fats or plant oils since they absorb and retain fragrance molecules [ [15](#B15-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Most of the historical analyses of ancient Egyptian perfumes only describe the base material as fat- or oil-based due to the limited advances in chemical analysis techniques in the early 1900s. Some of the ingredients that would have been locally available in the region at the time would have been plant-based oils such as sesame oil (Sesamum indicum L.), castor oil (Ricinus communis L.), and moringa oleifera). Other oils, such as olive oil (Olea europea) and almond oil (Prunus amygdalus), as well as animal fats (ox, sheep, and fowl fat) could have also been used [ [14](#B14-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [16](#B16-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Tombs of people who underwent a mummification process were compared to those of tombs that were naturally mummified by extremely arid conditions. Mummies from both groups were found to have fatty material (palmitic and stearic acid) applied to their styled hair. Therefore, this data suggests that the coating of hair with a fatty substance was not necessarily a part of the embalming procedure. However, it should also be pointed out that during the mummification procedure, hair was often treated with fat-based preparations. [17](#B17-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Furthermore, archeologists suggest that wigs were placed on the heads of shaved mummies to prepare them for the afterlife. For example, Queen Nodjmet who was relatively old when she died in 1064 BC, was found to have a wig believed to help her look younger for the afterlife (see [Figure 3](#cosmetics-10-00071-f003)). [18](#B18-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Unfortunately, the resin was never properly analyzed; however, myrrh gum resin (Commiphora myrrha) was commonly used in ancient Egypt. There are several different species of Commiphora indigenous to the northeastern African continent. In addition to its antimicrobial properties, myrrh is a remedy for numerous ailments in herbal medicine [ [19](#B19-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [20](#B20-cosmetics-10-00071)]. The liver should then be cooked in water and mixed with lard prior to application to the scalp. More than likely, this treatment probably does not work, although there are not any studies to the authors' knowledge that disprove it. In general, herbal medicine was important in ancient Egypt. Some medical prescriptions in dermatology consisted of acacia (Acacia nilotica), Aloe vera, and turmeric (Curcuma longa) for treating skin diseases and burns as well as serving as wound healing agents [ [21](#B21-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [22](#B22-cosmetics-10-00071)]. 3. Traditional Chinese Medicine [23](#B23-cosmetics-10-00071), [24](#B24-cosmetics-10-00071), [25](#B25-cosmetics-10-00071), [26](#B26-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Most of the skin remedies in Traditional Chinese Medicine are decoctions (multi-ingredient) that are taken orally for several weeks. Topical preparations often consist of a single ingredient. Treatments for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, eczema, and other skin ailments are described in Bencao Gangmu. [Table 1](#cosmetics-10-00071-t001)contains a list of several plant species that are used for the treatment of skin ailments in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Carthami flos is the floret of the safflower plant which belongs to the sunflower (Asteraceae) family. Mugwort has been used in traditional systems of medicine in different parts of the world. Nowadays, oral administration of mugwort is suggested for digestive problems, irregular menstruation, and high blood pressure. It also has properties that make it useful as a sedative, laxative, and liver tonic. Semen benincasae, also referred to as Dong Gua Zi, is a melon whose seeds are crushed into a paste and then applied to skin. Taoren (Semen persicae) is the fruit kernel of peach (the kernel is the soft part of a seed). In general, there is renewed interest in understanding the history of skin care in China; however, there is not very much information available in the academic literature [ [27](#B27-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [Figure 4](#cosmetics-10-00071-f004)for the structure of selected in the Gingko biloba plant. Gingko seeds are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to treat skin infections (topical antimicrobial). Present-day studies have shown that Ginkgo seed extracts protect against gram-positive skin pathogens: [31](#B31-cosmetics-10-00071)]. During the Zhou Dynasty (1050-221 BC), women of all classes could wear nail polish. Higher social ranking individuals painted their nails and covered them with silver and gold dust. Average Chinese women were allowed to wear neutral colors (e.g., pink). Not abiding to these norms could result in punishment and even the death penalty. During the same period, the early Egyptians also painted their nails (mostly with henna). Cleopatra is known for wearing a henna-based red nail polish. Berries were also used to stain the nails. Nail painting was also carried out during the era of the Babylonian empire. 4. Ayurvedic Medicine [32](#B32-cosmetics-10-00071), [33](#B33-cosmetics-10-00071), [34](#B34-cosmetics-10-00071), [35](#B35-cosmetics-10-00071), [36](#B36-cosmetics-10-00071)]. For the sake of brevity, we only touch upon certain aspects of Ayurvedic medicine and the treatment of skin. [37](#B37-cosmetics-10-00071), [38](#B38-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Diet and water are believed to play an important role in the overall health state of the skin. In general, Ayurvedic treatments focus on skin beauty as well as treating skin disorders, such as acne vulgaris, aging skin, eczema, psoriasis, and vitiligo. Sesame oil, which contains lignan compounds (sesamin and sesamolin) is used as a base in many Ayurvedic cosmetic preparations. Face mask preparations traditionally contain buttermilk and goat milk powder\u2014rich in vitamin A, B6, B12, and E\u2014providing emollient properties to the skin. A popular shampoo ingredient is the herb shikakai, which comes from the shikakai pods and nuts of the Acacia concinna shrub. The pods contain saponins, which acts as mild detergents [ [39](#B39-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [Table 2](#cosmetics-10-00071-t002). Aloe vera has been used by some of the ancient cultures for millennia, including China, Greece, Egypt, India, and Mexico. Mucopolysaccharides in Aloe vera bind water and help maintain moisture levels of the skin. Aloe vera contains numerous vitamins (vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene), enzymes (anti-inflammatory and metabolism of sugars and fats), minerals (to promote enzyme activity), anthraquinones (laxatives), and hormones [ [40](#B40-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [41](#B41-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Curcuma longa (Curcumin) is the yellow pigment obtained from the rhizome of the perennial herb turmeric. It has received a lot of interest in recent years as a skin treatment due to anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, Ativisha) is considered one of the world's worst weeds, known for infecting crops and other plants. In addition to its role as an alternative for Ativisha, coco grass was also shown to regulate hair growth, which was suggested to result from the activity of flavonoids on the androgenic activity of the hair follicle [ [44](#B44-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [47](#B47-cosmetics-10-00071)]. In wound healing, its mechanism of action is believed to result from the proliferation of fibroblasts leading to an increase in collagen synthesis, elevated levels of fibronectin in the extracellular matrix, and a reduction of inflammation [ [45](#B45-cosmetics-10-00071)]. 5. Color Cosmetics on the Indian Subcontinent [48](#B48-cosmetics-10-00071)]. 5.1. Kumkum [Figure 5](#cosmetics-10-00071-f005)and [Figure 6](#cosmetics-10-00071-f006)). Early in history, lime was used as a plaster agent, fertilizer, hair dye, and soap ingredient. [49](#B49-cosmetics-10-00071), [50](#B50-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Nowadays, some of the products that claim to be organic and/or natural kumkum use borax (sodium borate salt), alum (hydrated sulfated salt of aluminum), lemon/lime juice, plant powders, and plant oils (e.g., sesame, jojoba, almond). The salts provide the necessary caustic conditions for curcumin to change its color from yellow to red. 5.2. Kajal [51](#B51-cosmetics-10-00071)]. In addition to lead sulfide (PbS) found in galena, commercial formulations have been reported to contain minium carbon, magnetite (Fe3O4), and zincite (ZnO) Carbon black has become a more common modern-day version of kajal, which circumvents any issues that could be associated with lead poisoning from traditional kajal. It should be pointed out that some scientists distinguish between the chemical composition of kohl and kajal [ [48](#B48-cosmetics-10-00071)]. 5.3. Henna [Figure 7](#cosmetics-10-00071-f007)) is the principal dye molecule component responsible for its characteristic orange-red color. Henna is also the primary dye component used in the body art Mehndi, which has been practiced since the 4th or 5th century BC and is still common today in India and surrounding regions. Mehndi is typically administered on the hands and/or legs and is especially popular for traditional Hindu weddings. [53](#B53-cosmetics-10-00071)]. The preparation and application of henna hair formulations is a more time-consuming process than conventional hair dye systems. In addition, the colorfastness of conventional commercial hair systems is greater than natural henna dyes. 6. Cosmetics in Ancient Mesopotamia [54](#B54-cosmetics-10-00071), [55](#B55-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [56](#B56-cosmetics-10-00071)]. The use of eye cosmetics was very similar to the customs in Egypt\u2014essentially another form of kohl. Lotion and unguent formulations were devised to care for the skin and protect it from the powerful UV radiation and dry climate in the region. 7. Cosmetics and Dermatology in Ancient Greece and Rome [57](#B57-cosmetics-10-00071)]. There was a noteworthy Egyptian influence on the development of Greek cosmetics. Some of the cosmetic ingredients used during that time for color cosmetic applications included chalk (limestone), lapis-lazuli (a deep blue metamorphic rock), and malachite (discussed in the section Egyptian Cosmetics) [ [58](#B58-cosmetics-10-00071)]. During the archaic period (800-490 BC), women started to treat their skin with lead-based creams that provided a whitening effect. The use of such lead-based formulas to make the skin appear whiter persisted until the 18th century in Europe. [59](#B59-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Other information comes from literature and poetry (e.g., the poet Ovid). Some of the beauty attributes during this period include pale skin, joining of the two eyebrows by a patch of hair (monobrow), and blonde or auburn (reddish-brown) hair. Skin lightening became increasingly important since Roman women spent more time outside of the house than their Greek predecessors. While cosmetics were used by all echelons of society, for women with a higher standing in society, cosmetics were typically applied in a small room with the help of female slaves known as cosmetae. [Table 3](#cosmetics-10-00071-t003)contains a selection of different treatments that were included in the works of Pliny the Elder and Cornelius Celsus and summarized by Ursin et al. [ [60](#B60-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Rather than an exhaustive list, selected ingredients are discussed. The first ingredient in the table is Alcyonium\u2014the soft coral genus (sponge-type) from the Mediterranean Sea\u2014which, according to ancient legends, served as the nest for the halcyon, a bird nowadays that is identified as the kingfisher. While there is certainly a fair amount of literature describing different ingredients in Alcyonium, to the authors' knowledge there are not any published studies focused on its efficacy in the treatment of the skin. [Table 3](#cosmetics-10-00071-t003)is narcissus, which is a genus of perennial plant that is commonly known as the daffodil. There are two published studies (by the same group) that demonstrate its efficacy in the prevention of chronological skin aging\u2014it was proposed that a decrease in cell turnover time produces this effect [ [61](#B61-cosmetics-10-00071), [62](#B62-cosmetics-10-00071)]. In another study looking at cell proliferation and dermal structural components, an increase in the production of growth factors, signaling molecules, structural biomarkers, and oxidative stress indicators was observed for a blend of Narcissus tazetta bulb extract and Schisandra chinensis fruit extract [65](#B65-cosmetics-10-00071)]. In addition to simple carbohydrates (fructose and glucose), honey contains enzymes, vitamins, minerals, and other molecules with bioactivity. Furthermore, honey has antimicrobial properties, which has led to interest in its use against pathogenic microorganisms that mitigate the skin [ [66](#B66-cosmetics-10-00071), [67](#B67-cosmetics-10-00071)]. More than likely, its potential as a wound healing agent stems from its antimicrobial activity [ [68](#B68-cosmetics-10-00071), [69](#B69-cosmetics-10-00071), [70](#B70-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Moreover, the immunomodulating properties of honey should provide additional support for wound healing and the treatment of other skin disorders [ [71](#B71-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [72](#B72-cosmetics-10-00071)]. See [Figure 8](#cosmetics-10-00071-f008)for a representative example of a molecule from the furanosesquiterpenes class. Surprisingly, there have not been many studies aimed at better understanding the potential of myrrh in skin care [ [73](#B73-cosmetics-10-00071), [74](#B74-cosmetics-10-00071)]. There has been concern about potential skin sensitizers in myrrh due to the high degree of variability in the sources of myrrh and the complex nature of the myrrh exudate [ [75](#B75-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [76](#B76-cosmetics-10-00071)]. There are many [Figure the key molecules that provide the typical orris root scent and are commercially important in the fragrance industry [ [78](#B78-cosmetics-10-00071)]. In a recent study, there was interest about the potential of orris root to impede the activity of the stress hormone, cortisol, in skin [ [79](#B79-cosmetics-10-00071)]. 8. Cosmetics in Europe during the Renaissance and Modern Era 8.1. Venetian Ceruse [80](#B80-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Ceruse was typically prepared with water, vinegar, and lead carbonate. Venetian ceruse refers to a particular type of ceruse that was of the highest quality, probably due to the purity of white lead. [Figure 10](#cosmetics-10-00071-f010)) is probably one of the most well-known historical figures that used Venetian ceruse to whiten her face. As a child, she had smallpox, which in sixteenth-century Europe had a mortality rate of 30%, leaving her deeply scarred for life. For this reason, she used ceruse and other preparations, giving her an almost clown-like appearance. Maria Coventry, Countess of Coventry (1733-1760 AD) and London society hostess, was another known figure during this period who was afflicted with the negative consequences of using lead carbonate-based cosmetics. At the age of 28, the Countess of Coventry died from lead poisoning [ [81](#B81-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Often, the use of ceruse led to the formation of eruptions on the skin, which women tried to cover up by applying more ceruse, thereby creating a vicious cycle. [82](#B82-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Today, exposure to heavy metals in face paint is still a concern for Chinese opera actors [ [83](#B83-cosmetics-10-00071)]. 8.2. Cinnabar [Figure 11](#cosmetics-10-00071-f011)). It is the most common ore used to obtain refined elemental mercury. Overexposure to mercury leads to neurotoxicity, which affects the body's nervous system. Cinnabar has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurveda for thousands of years; however, in today's health-conscious environment, there certainly are concerns about its toxicity [ [84](#B84-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Nowadays, some commercial color cosmetics (e.g., lipstick) brands use the word cinnabar as a description of the makeup color. 8.3. Perfumed Gloves [85](#B85-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [86](#B86-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [87](#B87-cosmetics-10-00071)]. The aroma of the essential oil is extremely sought after, especially in the Arab world, and is extremely expensive (agarwood is the most expensive wood in the world) [ [88](#B88-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Stress to the tree caused by a fungus induces the formation of the aroma. The aromatic and medicinal properties of agarwood are thought to arise from about 150 identified compounds that include sesquiterpenoids, chromones, and volatile aromatic compounds [ [89](#B89-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [90](#B90-cosmetics-10-00071)]. 9. The Perfume Industry in France [91](#B91-cosmetics-10-00071)]. During the crusades, many scents were brought back to Europe from the Eastern Mediterranean. The crusades were a series of wars (ca. 1096-1291 AD) between the European Christians and Muslims to take control of the Holy Land, located in modern-day Israel. In the Renaissance period, perfume was mostly worn by royalty and the upper echelon of society to mask body odor. During the reign of Louis XV (18th century AD), his court became known as la cour perfume due to their excessive use of perfume. Madame Pompadour (mistress of Louis XV), Marie Antoinette (18th century AD; last queen of France before the French Revolution), and Duchesse d'Aumont (18th-19th century AD) are well-known figures in French history who were perfume enthusiasts. The nobility did not practice very good personal hygiene primarily due to their fear of water and the belief that most diseases were transmitted through water. [92](#B92-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Grasse, a small village just north of the French Riviera, became the center of the perfume industry. Some of the plant species harvested in the south of France consisted of jasmine of a blooming lavender field in Grasse, France. 10. Traditional Japanese Customs [93](#B93-cosmetics-10-00071)]. The white powder applied to the face and known as oshiroi contained lead carbonate, with the same composition as ceruse, which was applied in Europe during the Renaissance and Modern era. Beni (lipstick) was formulated by making a pulp of the safflower plant (Carthamus tinctorius L.) and then extracting the red and yellow dyes. Beni was normally placed in small bowl and became red when moistened. Komachi beni\u2014made from pure high-quality safflower\u2014dates as far back as the Edo period (1603-1867 AD) in Japan. Two principal dye components in the safflower plant are carthamidin (yellow) and carthamin (red), whose molecular structures are provided in [Figure 13](#cosmetics-10-00071-f013)[ [94](#B94-cosmetics-10-00071), [95](#B95-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Carthamin is not soluble in water while carthamidin is water soluble. Nowadays, carthamin (Natural red 26) is used as a color additive in food and cosmetic products. The safflower plant contains many molecules of pharmacological importance [ [96](#B96-cosmetics-10-00071)]. 11. Body Art in Tribal Cultures 11.1. Body Painting by African Tribes [97](#B97-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Beckwith and Fisher spent many years traveling across Africa photographically documenting the customs of many of its inhabitants. In the paragraphs that follow, we summarize some of their findings in relation to the art of body painting. [98](#B98-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Red ochre has been one of the most used pigments worldwide throughout history and contains the mineral hematite, which gives it is characteristic reddish hue [ [99](#B99-cosmetics-10-00071)]. In general, clays have been used to treat dermatological diseases, clean the skin, provide moisturization, and provide UV protection [ [100](#B100-cosmetics-10-00071), [101](#B101-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [Figure 14](#cosmetics-10-00071-f014)contains a photograph of a Surma man with facial and body painting demonstrating the use of chalk. [Figure 15](#cosmetics-10-00071-f015)contains a photograph of a young Himba woman with otjize applied to the skin and hair giving it a reddish hue. The hair arrangement is typical for Himba women styled into thick lustrous braids that symbolize their fertility. [102](#B102-cosmetics-10-00071)]. The tattoos appeared to be located along acupuncture and pressure points, suggesting that they were for therapeutic reasons and not for cosmetic adornment. 11.2. Ingredients Used in Native American Body Art [103](#B103-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Much of what we know about the cosmetic painting customs of Native Americans comes from the work of George Catlin who painted portraits and provided a historical account of their customs and practices. [Figure 16](#cosmetics-10-00071-f016)provides an example of the very subtle use of red ochre by a member of the Ojibbeway Nation. [Table 4](#cosmetics-10-00071-t004). While charcoal had various uses, in some Native American societies, a charcoal preparation was painted around the eyes and oftentimes even on the eyelids to prevent sun glare from decreasing visibility and damaging the eye. 11.3. Cosmetic Practices in South America and Mesoamerica [Table 5](#cosmetics-10-00071-t005)provides a list of several ingredients that were popular in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. Carmine is a bright red dye that is obtained by extracting carminic acid from the cochineal insect and mixing with aluminum or calcium salts. Nowadays, carmine (also known as C.I. Natural red 4 or C.I. 75470) is a popular dye ingredient in cosmetics and food products (see [Figure 17](#cosmetics-10-00071-f017)). It can be found in color cosmetic preparations, such as lipstick and some selected foundations. Carminic acid itself is a dye as well as several of its derivatives such as carmine. In the western hemisphere, carminic acid is obtained from the Dactylopius coccus species of cochineal. However, carminic acid can also be obtained from the Porphyrophora hamelii de campeche, a member of the legume family, which is also known as the blackwood, longwood, or bloodwood tree. A black dye, obtained from the red heartwood, was traditionally used as face paint in Mesoamerican tribes. Later, the Europeans used it as a textile dye in the 17th-19th centuries. [Figure 19](#cosmetics-10-00071-f019)contains a photograph of several young Kayap\u00f3 women where one can observe such patterns. Typical ingredients used by the Kayap\u00f3 as body paint include crushed seeds from the achiote shrub (red hues), liquid from the Genipa americana fruit (black color), and charcoal (dark hues). Interestingly, the liquid obtained from the Genipa americana fruit becomes black upon oxidation. After application to the skin, it remains in the upper levels of the epidermis for a couple of weeks. 11.4. Cosmetic Traditions in Oceania [Figure 20](#cosmetics-10-00071-f020)). Given the high sun exposure in Australia, dry skin is very common. Therefore, formulations are prepared to address dryness by using tubers from different plants from the jungle, while astringent preparation is derived from eucalyptus and acacia bark. Preparations based on eucalyptus and white/red cedar leaves are used for wound healing. [107](#B107-cosmetics-10-00071)]. 12. Urotherapy in Folklore Medicine [108](#B108-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Its use continued in the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance period. Urine predominately consists of water (95% w/w), the molecular structure of urea. Interestingly, urea is one of the components of the natural moisturizing factor (NMF) of skin. It is used as a moisturizing agent and to treat atopic dermatitis, ichthyosis, psoriasis, and xerosis [ [109](#B109-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Topical treatment of skin with urea provides moisturization at concentrations less than 10% (w/w) and acts as a keratolytic agent greater than 10% (w/w) [ [110](#B110-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [111](#B111-cosmetics-10-00071)]. In recent years, urotherapy (or pee facials) has become increasingly popular [ [112](#B112-cosmetics-10-00071)]. 13. Essential Oils [113](#B113-cosmetics-10-00071)]. They are volatile substances that are obtained by distillation of the plant. Essential oils have been used in medicine, pharmacology, and cosmetics for centuries due to their antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties [ [114](#B114-cosmetics-10-00071)]. They are rich in antioxidants and usually contain terpenes and terpenoids as well as a variety of phenolic compounds [ [115](#B115-cosmetics-10-00071)]. The use of essential oils for their medicinal properties is known as aromatherapy. [116](#B116-cosmetics-10-00071)]. As another example, the broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of tea tree oil protects against bacterial, viral, fungal, and protozoal infections of the skin [ [117](#B117-cosmetics-10-00071)]. There are many cases in the literature highlighting the beneficial effects that essential oils provide to the skin [ [118](#B118-cosmetics-10-00071), [119](#B119-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Due to the properties of essential oils already discussed, they also offer promise as wound healing agents [ [120](#B120-cosmetics-10-00071)]. [121](#B121-cosmetics-10-00071)]. It is believed that essential oils function as good permeation enhancers due to their ability to compromise the lipid phase of the stratum corneum due to interactions they have with stratum corneum proteins that might undergo conformational changes and weaken the skin's barrier properties. While many essential oils have been found to be effective permeation enhancers, it is not certain to what extent this was ever really put into commercial practice in the dermatological world. [122](#B122-cosmetics-10-00071), [123](#B123-cosmetics-10-00071)]. The plant families most cited as having insect repellent properties are Cymbopogon spp. (lemon grass), Ocimum spp., and Eucalyptus thymol has been noted [ [124](#B124-cosmetics-10-00071)]. 14. Natural Ingredients in Information Age [125](#B125-cosmetics-10-00071), [126](#B126-cosmetics-10-00071), [127](#B127-cosmetics-10-00071), [128](#B128-cosmetics-10-00071), [129](#B129-cosmetics-10-00071), [130](#B130-cosmetics-10-00071), [131](#B131-cosmetics-10-00071)]. This movement began products based on naturally derived polysaccharides from cellulose, guar gum, starch, and many other ingredients. These are functional biopolymers in the formulation that serve as rheology modifiers, binding agents, emulsifiers, and film formers. [132](#B132-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Today, almost every skin care formulation contains some form of antioxidant, either to be delivered to the skin so that it can biochemically exert its action or to help prevent oxidation in the cosmetic formula. 15. Understanding the Safety of Natural Ingredients in Modern-Day Cosmetics [133](#B133-cosmetics-10-00071), [134](#B134-cosmetics-10-00071)]. Many of today's product labels contain claims that the product is free of parabens, sulfates, PEGs, silicones, phthalates, and a growing list of chemicals that have become blacklisted in cosmetics. However, much less attention has been given to the potential toxicity of natural ingredients. A major concern is that labeling requirements of personal care products does not guarantee that a consumer will be aware of potentially hazardous ingredients. For example, many plant oils contain limonene, citral, citronellol, linalool, and other fragrance allergens. According to INCI requirements, only the Latin name of the botanical extract should appear on the label, which provides no indication of individual molecules that might create a hazardous condition. [135](#B135-cosmetics-10-00071)]. For example, in a grassland field, it was shown that isoflavone production (phytoestrogens) can reach up to 220 kg per hectare per year [ [136](#B136-cosmetics-10-00071)]. The harvesting of an increasing number and variety of plants for use in cosmetics could likely result in elevated levels of some toxic natural compounds, which could contaminate our waterways and soil. In addition, cosmetic ingredients that are washed from our skin and hair during showering and bathing could also accumulate in our waterways. 16.
