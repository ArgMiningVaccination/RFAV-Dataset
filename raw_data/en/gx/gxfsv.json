So many practitioners of health and wellbeing are frustrated by the limited, or non-sustainable outcomes of conventional western treatments, especially when working with clients who experience persistent challenges like depression, anxiety, addiction, and trauma. The latest scientific and medical research is now showing that Entheogenic Medicine when paired with professional guidance and other powerful modalities, offers enormous potential for deep personal healing and transformation. Esteemed institutions like Harvard, Yale, UCLA, New England School of Medicine, Imperial College London, and many others have established research departments for the continued development of Entheogenic Assisted Therapies. Here at EAST, we have combined the best practices of empirically proven methods with the ancient traditions of the indigenous cultures. Perhaps you've considered facilitating Entheogenic journeys for others, but you haven't had access to the right training program for you. Now you do, you have access to one of the premier methods for Entheogenic Assisted Therapy. The EAST Facilitator Program is a deep training curriculum that encompasses neuroscience, indigenous traditions, and six fully integrated healing modalities into one comprehensive program. "}
