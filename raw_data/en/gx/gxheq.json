We investigated the genetic basis of sex-specific differences in wing size between two closely related species of Nasonia by positional cloning a major male- specific locus, wing-size1 (ws1). Male wing size increases by 45% through cell size and cell number changes when the ws1 allele from N. giraulti is backcrossed into a N. vitripennis genetic background. A positional cloning approach was used to fine-scale map the ws1 locus to a 13.5 kilobase region. This region falls between prospero (a transcription factor involved in neurogenesis) and the master sex-determining gene doublesex . It contains the 5 9-UTR and cis-regulatory domain of doublesex , and no coding sequence. Wing size reduction correlates with an increase in doublesex expression level that is specific to developing male wings. Our results indicate that non-coding changes are responsible for recent divergence in sex-specific morphology between two closely related species. We have not yet resolved whether wing size evolution at the ws1 locus is caused by regulatory alterations of dsxorprospero, or by another mechanism.

Because of this, between-species genetic analysis of recentlyevolved sexual differences has been proposed as a way ofidentifying the genes and genetic changes that underlie morpho-logical diversification [1]. For example, Kopp et al. [2] have foundthat a sex-specific abdominal pigmentation difference that recentlyevolved between Drosophila species is caused by non-coding cis- regulatory changes in the bric-a-brac gene, changes which involve binding sites for conserved transcription factors doublesex and ABD- B[3]. The study of recently evolved sex differences can therefore reveal changes in tissue- and sex-specific gene regulatory networks.Nevertheless, there have been few studies investigating the geneticand molecular basis of the recent evolution of morphologicaldifferences between species, due in part to the difficulty of conducting genetic analyses in diverged species that are often reproductively incompatible. An active debate concerns whether the evolution of differences between species are due primarily to cis-regulatory or protein coding changes (e.g., [4-8]). While protein-coding changes havebeen the focus of most historical studies of phenotypic evolution, it has been argued that changes to non-coding cis-regulatory elements may be more important, as they are crucial to the spatiotemporal control of gene expression in development and can change with potentially fewer pleiotropic effects on other processes [4,5]. However, empirical support for this claim is limited, largely by the difficulty of determining the genetic basis of phenotypic changes to a fine enough level to distinguish between cisand protein-coding changes [6]. An additional issue concerns whether the standing genetic variation for phenotypes within populations represent the same spectrum of mutations that go to fixation and become involved in species differences in phenotype [7]. Therefore, additional genetic studies of phenotypic evolution in recently diverged species are needed to help reveal the processes by which new morphologies evolve and the relative roles of cis-regulatory versus protein-coding changes in morphological evolution. Here we investigate the genetic basis of male-specific differences between two species of Nasonia ,N. vitripennis and N. giraulti .Nasonia is a complex of four closely related parasitic wasp species that is rapidly emerging as a model for evolutionary and developmental genetics [9,10]. Nasonia males are haploid, and therefore can be PLoS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 January 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | e1000821readily genotyped for visible and molecular markers regardless of marker dominance. Furthermore, unlike most organisms, Nasonia species can be made inter-fertile in the lab by removing bacterialsymbionts ( Wolbachia ) that cause sperm-egg incompatibilities among [11,12]. This permits movement of genesinvolved in phenotypic differences between the species bybackcrossing [13-15]. Utilizing flanking visible and recessivelethal mutations and genetic and genomic tools in Nasonia , positional cloning of genes involved in species differences canthen be accomplished [9]. N. giraulti males have large wings (Figure 1) and are capable of flight, whereas N. vitripennis males have vestigial wings and do not fly, although they use them in courtship and agonistic displays[16]. A major portion of the male-specific ws1and wdw increase wing size in a sex specific fashion, as seen when introgressed from N. giraulti by backcrossing into an N. vitripennis background. In this study, we positionally clone the ws1 locus to a 13.5 Kb which falls near the sexdetermining locus doublesex [17,18] and includes its 5 9UTR. This is the first positional cloning of a gene in Nasonia , and the study illustrates methods for utilizing haplodiploidy for efficient cloningof interspecies QTL in this genetic system. Results/Discussion Sex-specific differences in wing size Nasonia wings are composed of a larger forewing and smaller hindwing. Here we focus our attention on the forewing, althoughmore subtle differences in the hindwing are also found between thespecies and sexes. N. giraulti male forewings are 2.16 fold larger in area than N. vitripennis male forewings, although female wings of both species are large and more similar in size (Figure 1; Table 1;[13,15]). Weston et al. [13] previously identified a major locusaffecting the interspecies male wing size difference, called giraulti allele at this locus ( ws1 g) was shown to increase wing size by approximately 60% when introgressed from N. giraulti into a N. vitripennis background, accounting for 44% of the species difference. To positional clone this major sex-specific wing QTLand to more precisely describe its phenotypic effects we (a) reduced the size of the introgressed sequence flanking the ws1locus to a 40kb segment (see fine-scale mapping and cloning below) and (b)backcrossed the introgressed ws1 gsegment into a standard N. vitripennis strain (AsymCX) genetic background for .10 genera- tions. This strain is referred to as ws1 gV_40kb, and is used to more precisely assess the effects of the ws1 gallele on wing size in comparison to the ws1 vallele in the same genetic background. Overall male forewing area of ws1 gV_40kb is 45% the locus accounts for 39% of the species difference in male wing area. Male forewing length and width are similarlyincreased (Table 1; HSD tests, p ,0.001). In contrast, female wing length, width and area are unaffected by the ws1allele (Table 1; HSD tests; p .0.05), confirming the sex-specific effects of this locus. A more detailed analysis of phenotype was conducted using setae (wing cell hairs) to estimate cell size and cell number effects ofws1 g. Setae have also been used in Drosophila to estimate the relative contribution of cell size and cell number to wing size (e.g.,[19]). In Nasonia , setae cover the distal portion of the wing, but are sparse in the proximal portion (Figure 1). Most of the size increasedue to ws1 gis in the distal portion of the wing as well (73% increase distal to the costal cell versus 21% increase proximal). Wetherefore estimated seta densities in the distal portion of the adultwing after first establishing that there was a relationship betweencell number and seta number. Cell density N. vitripennis male forewings is 3.260.4 SD, compared to 4.6 60.4 SD in N. giraulti (Mann- Whitney U-test, p ,0.05, n = 12). In contrast, the ws1 gVintrogres- sion shows the same density of cells per seta as N. vitripennis (3.260.3 SD for each; U-test, p .0.05, n = 12), indicating that this species difference is not under the genetic control of the ws1locus. We then estimated cell number by counting total seta numbers onthe distal portion of the adult wing and estimated cell size bycalculating the distance to each seta's nearest neighbors. Based onthese calculations, the wsl gallele increases overall cell size by 21%63% (SD) and cell number by 45% 65%, resulting in a Figure 1. Wing size differences due to ws1.

Scale bar: 100 mm. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1000821.g001Author Summary The regulation of cell size and cell numbers is an important part of determining the size of organs in development, as well as of controlling cell over-proliferation in diseases such as cancer and diabetes. How the regulation of cellsize and number can change to produce different organsizes is not well understood. Here, we investigate the recent evolution of sex-specific wing size differences between two species that involve changes to cell sizeand number regulation. Males of the emerging geneticmodel wasp Nasonia vitripennis have small wings and do not fly, while males of the closely related species N. giraulti have large wings and do fly. We isolated a locus thatcontributes substantially to this wing size difference by increasing cell size and cell number. Surprisingly, we found that the determinant for this wing size difference is locatedin the non-coding region between two known transcrip-tion factors, the master sex determining gene doublesex and neurogenesis regulator prospero . The mechanism by which ws1regulates sex specific wing growth has yet to be determined, although differences in dsxexpression level in developing male wings may indicate a role for this sex determination locus.Wing Size Evolution in Nasonia PLoS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 2 January 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | e100082173%610% increase in area of the distal half of the wing (Table 2; HSD tests, p ,0.05). It would be useful to know whether large or small male wing- size is ancestral in the Nasonia lineage. Other closely related species (e.g. Trichomalopsis sarcophagae ,T. dubia , and Urolepis rufipes ) have males with large functional wings, suggesting that this state isancestral. However, the situation is complicated by the fact thatthe most basal diverging Nasonia species, N. vitripennis, has small wings (Figure 1), whereas the other species form a monophyleticclade [20] that contains both species with intermediate ( N. longicornis ) and large and N. oneida ) [15,20]. Thus, we can postulate that either (a) male wing reductionbegan in the common ancestor to all four species, with subsequentincrease in the lineage leading to N. giraulti and N. oneida , (b) smaller male wing size has independently evolved in N. vitripennis and N. longicornis , or (c) there has been introgression of one or more small-wing alleles between N. vitripennis and N. longicornis . Resolution of these alternatives will require more detailedphenotypic and sequence evaluation of the QTL involved in sex specific wing evolution. Positional cloning of ws1 Positional cloning of the ws1locus involved the following steps: (a) recessive lethals flanking ws1 were generated using already identified linked visible mutants, (b) these were then used to sequentially generate a set of recombinants on both sides of ws1for fine-scale mapping and cloning of the gene, (c) a molecular (AFLP)marker tightly linked to ws1 was identified by genotyping recombinants, (d) this marker was then used to identify a set of BACs covering the region, which were assembled into contigs [21], (e) PCR based markers were developed for determining recombination intervals within the region using sequences fromthe BAC containing the AFLP marker, end sequences of BACs, and corresponding vitripennis and/or giraulti markers (Table S1), (f) a set of increasingly finer-scale recombinants were screenedto delineate the ws1region and finally (g) additional sequence analysis within the cloned region was conducted to identify features within the region and differences between N. vitripennis and N. giraulti . The latter effort was enhanced by the availability of genome sequences for ADAO00000000) [10] which became available during the course of this project. The method of assembly of BAC contigs is described in [21]. The approach for generating linked lethals and using these for cloning of QTL is described in methods and shown in Figure 2.Due to male haploidy, this method can be used to efficiently screen for recessive lethals linked to any gene of interest within the genome. Briefly, new lethal mutations linked to ws1 were generated by EMS mutagenesis followed by screening for linkage of the lethal to ws1. Use of custom-made lethals in this approach was effective because non-recombinant haploid males with the genotype lethal ws1 gdie and, therefore, the only surviving males carrying the ws1 gallele are recombinants between the lethal and wing size locus ( +ws1 g) (Figure 2). These tightly linked lethals increased the ''effective'' discovery rate of recombinants within the region by 100-200 fold (Figure 2), greatly enhancing efficiency of the positional cloning effort. Thus, we were able to positionallyTable 2. Cell number and size effects of ws1, as estimated by seta number and area.

Screening of additional recombinantmales further reduced the size of the region known to cause the ws1 g large-wing phenotype to 13.5kb (Figure 3C). Positional cloning ws1shows it to fall adjacent to the protein coding region of doublesex (dsx,GeneID 100302336), a master sex determination gene found from nematodes to mammals [17,18].The 13.5kb ws1region contains the dsx59UTR, promoter and presumed cis-regulatory region but notably excludes the protein coding regions of dsxor any other gene (Figure 3B). This gene was confirmed as the Nasonia ortholog of doublesex based on protein domains, expression pattern, sex specific splice forms, and experimental demonstration that splice forms are associated withsex in a gynandromorph producing line [18]. This previous work onNasonia dsx [18] confirmed the coding regions, 5 9UTR, 3 9UTR, exons and introns for both male and female specific splice-forms(shown in Figure S2) in both N. vitripennis and N. giraulti . Upstream of the ws1region, the nearest gene was identified by BLAST to be a homolog of the D. melanogaster gene prospero (pros, GeneID (Figure 3B). In Drosophila ,prospero is a transcription factor that specifies cell fate and cell growth in the nervous system [23]. Wealso identified a single EST (Genbank EV431998) within the 13.5kb region from the Nasonia EST dataset [10]. The EV431998 EST contains 5-8 stop codons in each frame and is not spliced,and therefore does not appear to be a protein-coding gene. RT-PCR of EV431998 failed to detect this transcript from wing, leg orwhole prepupa cDNA, whereas the primers did amplify from genomic DNA controls. The evidence therefore indicates that the ws1 phenotype is due to non-coding DNA within the 13.5kb region. A number of sequence differences occur between giraulti and vitripennis in the 13.5kb ws1region .W e sequenced the full foldback element and found that it does not contain protein coding sequences, but two inverted repeats of approximately 1.5kb and two small ''stem loop'' regions.Investigation of intraspecific variation in the 13.5kb region andultra-fine scale mapping is now being undertaken to narrow theregion that is involved in the ws1phenotype. Effects of ws1 ondsxand pros expression Based on our findings revealing ws1to contain the 5 9non- coding region of doublesex , we next determined whether this region affects dsxexpression. Nasonia doublesex has male and female splice- forms, and experimental evidence supports its role in sexdetermination in Nasonia [18]. As expected, the male splice-form ofdsx(dsx M) is present in developing male wings of vitripennis (ws1 vV) and ws1 gV_40kb (Figure S3). However, quantitative RT- PCR reveals an estimated 2.4X higher level of dsxMtranscript in developing prepupal male wings of ws1 vrelative to ws1 gin the same vitripennis genetic background (Figure 4; U-test, p = 0.04, n = 7 biological replicates). In contrast, there is no significant difference between the two genotypes in dsxMtranscript levels in male legs or whole pre-pupae (Figure 4; U-tests, p .0.05, n = 5). We also measured expression of dsxin female wings using non-sex- specific primers and observed no clear difference due to ws1 g (median 1.01x expression difference, n = 3; Table 3). No expression difference was found in male wings for the flanking gene prospero (Table 3; median 1.07x expression difference between ws1 gV_40kb ). We note that while the introgression appeared to have no effect on prosexpression in wings, higher prostranscript levels were observed in ws1 vV_40kb whole prepupae (Table 3). A likely explanation for this whole-bodyeffect is that the larger 40kb of giraulti sequence in the tested strain extends over part of the prosgene, possibly affecting its regulation in whole body. These gene expression data provide a sex- and tissue-specific correlation between dsxexpression level and wing size. As with other positional cloning studies, our data do not rule out alternative scenarios that could link causative sequence changes in the 13.5kb region to wing size, such as (undetected) effects onprospero or long-distance regulation of a different gene. However, we do note that we started with a sex-specific phenotype and''walked'' to a region adjacent to a gene known to be involved in somatic sex determination. Future work will be geared towards Figure 2. Positional cloning in Nasonia using linked lethals. The diagram illustrates a screen for fine-scale recombinants (marked with *)between ws1 gand a lethal located 0.6cM away. Because of the lethal ( l), the only live haploid males with ws1 g(large wings, w) are recombinant.

Concluding remarks Our results show that non-coding changes are responsible for thews1male-specific wing phenotype. Unlike studies of candidate genes involved in sex differentiation, the positional cloningapproach is candidate-blind, so it is intriguing that the region weidentified as causing a sex specific increase in wing size ( ws1) also contains the 5 9UTR of the sex-signaling gene doublesex . Nevertheless a causal relationship between ws1and dsxhas not yet been established. Previous studies [3,24] have implicated dsxin the evolution of sex-specific morphology. But rather than changesindoublesex itself, these studies revealed changes in downstream targets of dsx, via changes to specific DNA sequences to which DSX protein binds in the cis-regulatory regions of the bric-a-brac and desatF genes and affecting sex differences in abdominal pigmentation and pheromone production. In this study, weobserved tissue-specific changes in dsxlevel, possibly due to cis- regulation. Dsxexpression level manipulation has been found to affect cell number of a sex-specific cell type in the Drosophila brain[25]. If dsxis indeed the mechanism behind ws1, it would be the second case of dsxregulating sex-specific cell proliferation. Further, it would suggest that sex-specific morphology can evolve by Figure 3.

Prospero is of particular interest because it is a transcription factor known to regulate cell proliferation in theDrosophila nervous system [23]. Cell size and cell number regulation are crucial elements of both organ size determination and control of human diseases suchas cancer and diabetes [26]. Understanding how growthregulation can evolve therefore has the potential to broaden ourknowledge of the operation of these gene networks. One notableexample of organ size evolution is fw2.2, which regulates tomato fruit size via cell number changes [27]. This gene was positionallycloned [27] and found to be a cell cycle regulator in plants [28]. InNasonia , non-coding cis-regulatory evolution at the ws1 locus causes changes in both cell size and cell number. The two genesflanking the ws1region, doublesex and prospero , have both been found to regulate neuronal cell numbers in Drosophila ,a n d doublesex does so sex-specifically [23,25]. How a 45% change in organ size might be achieved by either of these genes, each of which hasa conserved homologue in the human genome, remains to bedetermined. This study demonstrates the feasibility of positional cloning genes in Nasonia . A number of biologically important phenotypic differences occur between Nasonia species, which are ripe for genetic investigation using this approach, such as wing andantennal morphology [20,37]. The four known Nasonia species are all inter-fertile in the laboratory, facilitating the isolation of genesinvolved in complex trait differences between each species [15,30].The availability of genome sequences [10] combined with thehaplodiploid positional cloning methods described here now make it possible to determine the evolution of these complex traits on a molecular level in this emerging model organism [9].Materials and Methods Strains used Wing measurements were conducted using the inbred N. vitripennis strain AsymC and inbred N. giraulti strain R16A; these data are also reported in [15]. Gene expression experiments were conducted with the N. vitripennis AsymCX strain used for genome sequencing [10], which was derived from AsymC by multiplegenerations of sib-mating. All wing size and gene experiments used the minimal-introgression ws1 gVstrain ws1 binants between ws1and linked visible and lethal mutants (see Positional Cloning below). This strain contains ,40Kb of introgressed giraulti DNA containing ws1 gin a vitripennis genetic background. It was constructed by backcrossing males fromminimal-recombinant strain wm114 (Rec 4 in Figure 3C) into AsymCX for 10 generations to produce a homogeneous genetic background. Wild-type N. vitripennis and N. giraulti are also referred to as ws1 vVand ws1 gGin the text. Wing size, cell size, and cell number measurements Wing measurements were performed as in [15]. Briefly, individual females were given two Sarcophaga bullata hosts for 48 hours at 25C after host-feeding for 24 hours on two hosts (whichwere discarded). Male wing samples were collected from theoffspring of single virgin females, while female wing samples were collected from the offspring of single mated females. Adult wings were dissected at the hinge adjoining the thorax and dry mountedon microscope slides under coverslips. Five individuals per familyfor 5-8 families were mounted; occasional damaged or misshapen wings meant that four individuals per family were measured. Wings were photographed on a Zeiss AxioImager Z1 com- pound scope at 10X as mosaic images. Measurements were performed on the wing images using AxioVision 4.6 software (Zeiss). Wing length, width, area, and head width (inter-oculardistance, a measure of body size) were measured as in [15]. Briefly, wing length is the distance between a notch at the proximal anterior end of the costal cell and the distal tip of the forewing.Wing width is the distance perpendicular to the length axisbetween the most anterior and most posterior points on the wing. Wing area is defined by outlining the wing starting at the proximal anterior notch. Measurements of wild-type N. vitripennis and N. giraulti shown here (Figure 1) are also reported in [15]. Images of ws1 gGand ws1 vVmale wings shown in Figure 1 were cropped to remove other mounted wings which appear in frame but are not related to the displayed image. Setae, hair-like structures produced by cells on the wing blade, were used to infer changes to cell size and number. This approach has been used to estimate cell size in other insects, particularlyDrosophila [19]. To determine if seta number is a of cell number in Nasonia , the number of cells per seta was determined at the red-orange-eye pupal stage, where setae are most distinguishable before the wing sclerotizes and cell nucleidisappear. Pupal male then fixed on lysine-coated slides in 3.7% formaldehyde. Slides were stained with DAPI and Alexa Fluor488-Phalloidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and mounted in ProLong Gold (Invitrogen). The wing is not completely expanded at this stage and has some three-dimensional structure (Figure S1).Therefore, wings were imaged at 20x as mosaics under multiplefocal planes, so that setae on both wing surfaces and all nuclei could be detected. All setae and nuclei were then counted within aTable 3. Gene expression analysis in the ws1 region.

Cell size and cell number estimates were derived from seta measurements on adult wings. Seta number and area per seta werecounted in the distal half of the wing, where setae occur, following[15]. Specifically, a subset of the mounted adult male forewings wasre-imaged at 20x through multiple focal planes. Each seta on thedorsal surface of the wing was counted and the area of the seta-containing part of the wing was measured (defined as the area distalto the costal cell, based on the length (proximal-distal) axis described above; [15]). Cell number was inferred from the total seta number. Cell size was inferred by estimating the mean area occupied by eachseta based on nearest neighbor distances using a custom perl script.Specifically, the average distance to each seta's four nearestneighbors ( nnd4 i) was calculated and then average area per seta across all isetae was estimated as the mean of pi * ( nnd4 i/2)2. Pairwise comparisons of wing measurements between genotypes (strains) were conducted using Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD test, [38]), based on ANOVAs using family as a nesting factor within genotype. Because several morphologicalvariables were measured per genotype, we used the conservativeBonferroni correction for multiple tests. P-values shown werecorrected by multiplying by the number of tests conducted in eachanalysis (Table 1: 8 tests (4 variables and 2 sexes per genotype).Table 2: 3 tests (3 variables per genotype). Positional cloning methods Positional cloning efforts were begun by identifying visible mutants linked to ws1. Using the original ws1introgression from giraulti into vitripennis (INTw1.1, [13]), it was ascertained that the visible eye color mutant or123 and body color mutant bl13 mapnear to ws1. A introgression of ws1 ginto vitripennis containing a large giraulti flanking region was used for most of the fine-scale mapping and positional cloning work (strainINT_bkbw, described in [14]). This introgression contains anaturally giraulti black eye color allele, bk g,linked to ws1. We found that bkgfails to complement the N. vitripennis mutant bk576 in heterozygous females. bkgproduces oyster-gray eyes in the pe333 (peach eye) mutant background, which is easier to see than the black eyes of the mutant in wild-type background. Arecombination map of these visible markers is shown in Figure 3A. To further assist in the positional cloning, recessive lethal mutations linked to ws1were generated in the INT_bkbw strain by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) treatment of males carrying ws1 g. Ten gbkg; pe333) males were paper soaked 10% sucrose solutioncontaining 0.25-0.5% EMS (Sigma Chemical). After 7-10h,males were transferred to a vial containing clean filter paperovernight. Mutagenized males were then crossed to linked visiblemutant strain bl13; pe333 . F1 virgin females were collected, transferred to individual cells of plastic 24-well culture plates (various manufacturers) and given a single fly host to lay eggs. Plates were sealed with a double layer of Micropore tape (productnumber 1530-03, 3M Corporation) and incubated at 25C. After48h, females were transferred to a new plate containing a pe333 male black-stage pupa and a spot of honey water. After mating,the wasps were anaesthetized at 4C and on ice, 2 fly hosts wereadded to each well, and then incubated at 21C. Newly-createdlinked recessive lethal markers were identified by distortions in F2ratios of the visible markers ( ws1 g,b k gand bl13) among the haploid F2 males of the virgin hosting (as in Figure 2) and then linkagerelationships were determined. Lethal lines were maintained usingheterozygous female offspring. One lethal line, lethal D4, was primarily used for mapping in this study, due to its close linkagetows1and its position on the side opposite the visible markers (Figure 3A). To collect recombinant males for positional cloning, females heterozygous for ws1 gand a flanking visible or lethal marker were set as virgins and resulting haploid male progeny were screened forrecombination between the marker locus and ws1by phenotype (Figure 2). Use of lethals in this a pproach was especially effective because non-recombinant haploid lethal ws1 gmales die; the only surviving males carrying the ws1 gallele were recombinants between the lethal and wing size locus. Penetrance of the lethal genes used was found to be 100%. These tightly linked markers increased the ''effective'' discovery rate of recombinants within the region by 100-200 fold, greatly enhancing efficiency of the positional cloning efforts. A crucial step in the cloning effort was identification of molecular markers within the ws1region to assist in fine-scale recombinant mapping. Initially this was accomplished byscreening the original ws1 gVintrogression line and recombinants between it and flanking visible markers for linked Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) markers. This was done using methods previously reported in [39]. A marker termed''AF1'' was identified and found to be tightly linked to ws1. The marker was cloned and sequenced. PCR products from primersdesigned to AF1 were used to screen a BAC library to N. vitripennis . Ends of a subset of BACs were sequenced, the library re-screened,and then RFLP a set of contig BACs [21]. BAC-end sequences were then used to generate set of molecularmarkers distinguishing vitripennis and giraulti by PCR accession AC185330) which included the entire ws1 g region and alignment of vitripennis and giraulti trace reads from the Nasonia genome project were used to identify additional PCR markers for ultra fine-scale mapping, and identification ofrecombination breakpoints by sequencing. Genotyping primersand PCR conditions are shown in Table S1. Over 2000 recombinant haploid males were identified between ws1and either the visible or lethal marker. These were screened with molecular markers to identify the location of recombination within the region around ws1. The most informative recombinants are shown in Figure 3C. These include recombinants producedfrom 1-4, 6-7). To define the ws1region further, a strain was established from a recombinant between the flankinglethal D4and ws1that contained a relatively small region of giraulti but retained the large wing phenotype (Rec1 inFigure 3C). This strain was used for subsequent recombination tothe other flanking region ( bl13 side). A recombinant from this second set containing only 40kb of giraulti sequence (Rec4, Figure 3C) yet still showing the '' ws1'' large-wing phenotype (Figure 1) was then backcrossed into the genome-sequenced AsymCX strain for .10 generations, and then purebred. This strain (called ws1 gV_40kb ) was used for wing measurements and quantitative PCR. Additional recombinants from these experi-ments further localized the ws1 geffect to a 10.8kb region in giraulti , and a corresponding 13.5kb in vitripennis due to insertion/deletion differences. We examined this sequence and flanking regions forgene predictions [10] and also manually scanned the region foropen reading frames and ESTs [18]. The region does not containprotein coding sequence for dsx, but only the dsx59UTR, promoter and cis-regulatory region. Recombination rate We estimated the recombination rate between ws1and lethalD4 by counting all (living) male offspring of a set of virgin females (lethalD4ws1 g/++) hosted for positional cloning. 89 males out ofWing Size Evolution in Nasonia PLoS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 7 January 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | e100082115594 screened were recombinant ( +ws1 g), a map distance of 0.57cM. Of a larger set of 683 +ws1 grecombinant males screened with the ws1-8 marker (Table S1), 6 were recombinant betweenws1-8 and ws1 g, a distance of 36-50kb (uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in the location of ws1 gin the 13.5kb region). Local recombination rate was calculated as [(0.57 cM 0.14 - 0.10 cM/Mb. RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR RNA was isolated from wing discs, leg discs and whole individuals at the third instar larvae - prepupal transition. Wefound that this stage can be precisely identified to a few hours, between defecation of the larvae and ecdysis. Wing and leg discs were dissected RNAse freeconditions in 1X phosphate-buffered saline. After dissection,tissues were placed immediately on dry ice and if necessary storedat280uC until RNA was isolated. Independent extractions of tissue were conducted to produce independent biological repli-cates. Each biological replicate consisted of 15-30 prepupal wingsor legs or a ( ws1 was isolated RNA was then quantified using a Qubit fluorometer Quant-iT in and AACTTTGTATTCC-CTCAGCCAC.

Supporting Information Figure S1 Wing setae are used to estimate changes in cell size. Example images of seta and nuclear density from male pupal andadult forewings are shown. Adult wing seta numbers and densitieswere used to infer changes in cell number and cell size due to ws1 (Table 2), based on estimates of the number of cells (nuclei) per seta inthe pupal wing (Data presented in main text). Precise counts wereperformed by examining multiple focal planes to track setae and nuclei across different depths. The figure shows single focal planes forsetae and for nuclei. (A-C) Setae from adult male forewings (G-I) show changes in seta density (which estimate cell size). All images are from the distal portion of the (e.g., A,D) are different fluorescence channels from the same image (coincident, but from different focal planes).
