During your first acupuncture appointment at Inclusive Natural Medicine, Dr. Schneller spends time with you discussing your specific concerns. She reviews your medical history and symptoms and may also check physical signs, like the pulse in your wrist or the appearance of your tongue. Then, she carefully inserts tiny sterile needles into specific points on your skin. The needles don't go in very deep, so most people don't feel pain. However, you may experience a brief sensation of discomfort when treating a particularly tender area. You relax on a comfortable table while the treatment takes effect. Depending on your needs, this may take 20-30 minutes. After that, Dr. Schneller returns to remove the needles. You shouldn't bleed or feel pain after acupuncture, but a small drop of blood or mild redness at the treatment site is normal.
