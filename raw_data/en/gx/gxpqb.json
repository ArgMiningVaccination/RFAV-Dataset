GreerExecutive Director, CECBecky J. SmithExecutive Director, AAHE HIV and AIDS INTRODUCTION PROJECT DESCRIPTIONHIV INFECTION AND AIDS PREVENTION:INTERDISCIPLINARY, MULTICULTURALAPPROACHES FOR STUDENTS ANDTEACHERS The Association for the Advancement of HealthEducation (AAHF) is conducting a five year projectaimed at preventing the transmission of the humanimmunodeficcy virus (HIV) by promoting HIVprevention and AIDS (acquired immunodeficiencysyndrome) education in comprehensive schoolhealth programs. The cooperative agreement isfunded by the Division for Adolescent SchoolHealth, Center for Chronic Disease Preventionand Health Promotion of the Centers for DiseaseControl.In 1988, AAHE project staff sought the assistanceof The Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) in(a) determining special educators' needs for informa-tion and materials about HIV prevention and (b)identifying HIV prevention curricula that may be ap-propriate for special education students. In January,1989, AAHE and CEC conducted a national forumof experts in health education and special educationto assess thc status of HIV prevention education forspecial education students. The conclusions andrecommendations of the forum are included in Sec-tion II of this booklet and may serve as a guide forthe development of HIV prevention programs.In addition to hosting the forum, AAHE and CEChave worked together on several endeavors that maybenefit special educators. One major activity was to 1collect curricula developed by various educationagencies across the nation and to convene a meetingof teams of health educators and special educatorsto review the curricula. The resulting curriculumrelated materials can be found in Section V of thisbooklet.In 1990, the two organizations developed andberm delivering training on HIV Prevention andAIDS Education for Children with Special Needs.The training model calls for teams of healtheducators and special educators to collaborate onthe planning and delivery of instruction. The train-ing is being conducted on a training-of-trainer basisthrough state and local education agencies (seeSection VI).The purpose of this booklet is to distribute the in-formation and products resulting from the AAHEand CEC collaboration to as many special educatersas possible. CEC and AAHE staff would like toexpress gratitude to the many individuals andorganizations who generously eontributPd informa-tion and materials. We hope the materials will serveto educate special education students about ways ofprotecting themselves from HIV. Project Staff Jolene EXCEPTIONALCHILDREN The Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) is theonly professional organization dedicated to improv-ing the quality of education for all exceptionalchildren and youth, both handicapped and gifted.CEC is an international association of over 54,000members located primarily in the United States andCanada. Membas are teachilss, administrators,teacher educators, students, support services profes-sionals, and parents. Special divisions within theorganization focus on the education of students withvarying exceptionalities: giftedness, mental retarda-tion, learning disabilities, visual impairments,communication impairments, physical disabilities,and behavior disorders. Other groups serve theinterests of early childhood special educators,administrators, teacher educators, college students,diagnosticians, and those especially interested intechnology, cultural diversity, career education, inter-national programs, and research. CEC has localchapters in each state and all of the Canadian provin-ces. This organizational structure provides manychannels through which members may enhance theirknowledge and contribute to the field of specialeducation.Since its founding in 1922, CEC has been com-mitted to providing exceptional students withappropriate educational experiences designed to nur-ture potential and support achievement. CECscommitment encompasses four major priority areos: 1.To advance the education of exceptionalpersons by improving access to specialeducation for underserved or inappropriate-ly served populations, such as the gifted and2dr*talented, young adults over age 18, certainlow incidence exceptionalities, and ethnicand culturally diverse students; and by ex-tending special education to children whocould benefit from, but are not now con-sidered entitled to such services. Examplesare children who are abused, neglected,suicidal, druxpendent, or who have AIDS. As a result of the passage of Public Law 99-457 in October 1986, adequate services areincreasingly available for children with dis-abilities, including those under age 5. CECsvolunteer advocacy network and profes-sional staff worked hard to promote thepassage of this landmark U.S. federal legisla-tion. Work continues for improvements inthe programs and funding. CEC, in cooperation with the NationalEducation Association, the AmericanFederation of Teachers, and the NationalAssociation of School Nurses, Inc., has pub-lished Guidelines for the Delineation ofRoles and Responsibilities for the SafeDelivery of Specialized Health Care in theEducational Setting (see Section VI of thisresource book for information on obtainingthe guidelines). To improve the conditions under whichprofessionals work with exceptional personsthrough the establishment of professionalstandards of practice and a code of ethics forall professionals involved in the education ofexceptional persons. CEC has completed a set of Standards andGuidelines for Curriculum Excellence inProfessional Preparation Programs for Spe-cial Education, which is being used by TheNational Council for Accreditation ofTeacher Education as the standards for spe-cial education training programs. 3.To improve the quality of instructionprovided exceptional persons by supportingthe development and dissemination of newknowledge, technology, methodology, cur-ricula, and materials on a nationwide basis. CEC's Annual Conventions provide oppor-tunities for thousands of members andothers interested in special education toshare their expertise, renew their energy,and spend time networking with colleagues.CEC is the host organization for severalprojects important to the education field,including the ERIC Clearinghouse onHandicapped and Gifted Children, Clearing-house for Professions in Special Education,and the Center for Special Education Tech-nology. CEC's Project RETOOL offerstraining in.advanced applications ofmicrocomputers in special education forpostdoctoral leadership personnel.CEC offers a variety of professional develop-ment opportunities including Academies forProfessional Collaboration, Effective In-struction, Bilingual Special Education, andCareer Education. State and local schooldistricts may contract with CEC to provideAcademies as inservice training. 4.To advance The Council for ExceptionalChi ldm by enhancing communication be-tween the organization and its individualmembers, units, and other organizations in-volved with exceptional persons.Through CEC's professional journals,TE,4CHING Erceptional Children and Excep-tional Children, books, computer searches,and media products, and through collabora-tive projects with other professionalassociations, state-of-the-art information iscontinually made available to specialeducators. 30OVERVIEWASSOCIATION FOR THEADVANCEMENT OF HEALTHEDUCATION Mission Statement The mission of the Association for the Advancementof Health Education (AAHE) is to advance health byencouraging, supporting and assisting health profes-sionals concerned with health promotion througheducation and other systematic strategies. Purposes and Objectives The basic purpose of AAHE is to promote theadvancement of health education by providing afocal structure for the encouragement, support andassistance of persons interested in concentratingtheir professional efforts on the improvement ofhealth through the development and conduct ofeffective health education programs in educationalinstitutions and other community settings.In fulfilling the previously stated purpose, AAHEseeks to: a.Ptovide information, resources and servicesregirding health education to professionalsand the lay public. b.Enhance a public awareness of the natureand purposes of health education. e.Enlist support in the development and pro-am implementation andevaluation ofhealth education programs. d.Foster the development and program im-plementation of the philosophical basis ofhealth education practices. e.Promote and interpret research relating toschool and community health education. 1.Promulgate criteria, guidelines and evalua-tion procedures for assessing theeffectiveness of preservice, inservice and g.continuing professional education of healtheducation personnel.Determine curriculum needs and assist inthe development and mobilization of resour-ces for effective health education at all levelsof education. h.Facilitate communication between schooland community personnel, and betweenprofessionals and the lay public, with respectto current health education principles,problems, and practices.j.Provide leadership in establishing programpolicies criteria and evaluative proceduresthat will promote effective health educationprograms.Inform the membership of current and pend-ing legislation related to AAHE interests,and, upon request, provide professional andtechnical assistance in drafting pertinentlegislation and related guidelines. k.Maintain effective liaison with other nation-al health education organizations. HIV and AIDS OUTCOMES OF THE NATIONAL FORUM ON HV/AIDSPREVENTION EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITHSPECIAL EDUCATION NEEDS In February, 1989, representatives of more than 25national organizations and governmental offices metat the headquarters of The Council For Exception!Children to assess the status of HIV infection AIDSprevention .2ducation for special education students.The forum was conducted by The Association for theAdvancement of Health Education as part of an HIVprevention education project funded by the Centersfor Disease Control.Presenters and participants in the forum workedtoward and achieved three objectives: 1.Determination of the extent to whichchildren and youth with disabilities arc atrisk for HIV infection. 2.Identification of the most appropriate cur-ricular delivery approaches to meeting theHIV prevention education needs of childrenand youth with disabilities. 3.Determination of the extent and methods bywhich HIV prevention education andgeneral health education needs of thispopulation are being met at present. After three days of presentations and discussions,forum participants reached conclusions and made avariety of recommendations that may assisteducators in planning HIV prevention programs forspecial learners.FORUM CONCLUSIONS All children, including special education stu-dents, need health education, which includesHIV infection prevention education. Health educators and special educatorsshould work together in delivery of HIV in-fection prevention education for childrenand youth with special needs. HIV infection prevention education forchildren and youth with special needs is ashared responsibility of state departments ofeducation and health, local school boardsand health departments, school ad-ministrators, teachers of health educationand special education, and parents/guardiansof children with special needs. National and state level policies about com-municable disease and HIV infectionprevention should be utilized to focus atten-tion on the need for education. Policies for implementing HlV infectionprevention education for enildren and youthwith special needs should be implemented atthe local level but may be modeled after sug-gestions developed by national experts. Professional organizations in health educa-tion and special education should developguidelines for health education, including HIV infection prevention education for FORUM RECOMMENDATIONS children and youth with special needs. Misunderstandings and misconceptionsabout HIV infection and AiDS need to beclarified for professionals, parents ofchildren with special needs, and childrenwith special needs. Special education teachers need preserviceand inservice training in health educationand HIV infection prevention education. Health education teachers need preserviceand inservice training in effective instruc-tional strategies for special learners. HIV infection prevention education shouldbe incorporated into training programs forparents of special education students. There is a lac: of educational and curricularresources in comprehensive health education and HIV infection preventioneducation for children and youth witl. spe-cial needs. HIV infection prcventioi curriculum andmaterials should be developed or modifiedso that different types of disabilities - cogni-tive, sensory, physical, behavioral - areaddressed. Local education agencies should select HIVinfection prevention curricula and materialsappropriate for children and youth with spe-cial needs. Objectives on HIV infection preventioneducation and health education should bewritten into students' Individualized Educa-tional Plane (IEP). HIV infcction prevention education shouldfocus on behavior. When youth with special needs areemployed in settings where they might be atrisk for HIV infection, thcy should receiveappropriate risk reduction training.6Policy Thcre is a need for educational organiza-tions to compile arid disseminate modelpolicies for HIV infection prevention educa-tion and comprehensive health educationfor children and youth with special educa-tion needs. These policies must be entered into a varietyof Ota bases, e.g. the Combined Health In-formation Database (CHID), EducationalResources Information Center (ERIC), andthe National AIDS Information Clearing-house. Training Institutions of higher education and stateand local education agencies should developand provide preservice and inservice train-ing for both specialeducators. Preservice(a)training mterial higher educa-tion classes(b)training educationand special teachers of trainers for professionaldevelopment specialists at theschool district level(e)within local education agencies col-laboration among coordinators ofhealth education and special educa-tion programs. Statewide ActivitiesState Education Agencies should (a)determine training needs within thestate(b)facilitate and coordinate trainingwithin the state. CurriculumDetermine the number and source of exist-ing comprehensive hcalth educationcurricula that include HIV prevention.Identify model eurricula in comprehensivehealth education and HIV infection preven-tion education appropriate for specialeducation populations.Develop strategies for compilation and dis-semination of model curricula.Support development of new curricula ormodification cf existing curricula as needed. Instruction Develop strategies for ensuring that specialeducation students receive appropriate com-prehens:ve health education instructionwhether it be in health education classes orspecial education classes. Develop mechanisms that facilitate col-laboration between health education aridspecial education teachers in providing in-struction. State and local education agencies need toensure that health education materials forspecial education students address theirlearning requirements. HIV andAIDS BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT HIV AND AIDS Since the beginning L,f the AIDS epidemic, there hasbeen a significant amount of misunderstanding aboutHIV and AIDS. The purpose of Section III of thisresource book is to provide the basic facts aboutthe virus, how it is transmitted, and how it can beprevented. Further, the section includes guidelinesfor special educators who occasionally come in con-tact with blood, vomitus, or other such fluids in thecourse of their work.The text was originally published in Responding toHIV and AIDS,a special publication for members ofthe National Education Association. John E. Burgerand James H. Williams were the editors. The texthas been updated and edited for this booklet by D.Peter Drotman,M.P.H., Center for InfectiousDiseases, Centers for Disease Control. THE HIV AND AIDS BASICS Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) wasfirst reported in the United States in mid-1981,Since that time more than 170,(XX) people have beendiagnosed with AIDS in the United States, and morethan 100,0(X) have died, No cure exists, and AIDS isexpected to claim increasing numbcrs of lives in thecoming years.As of mid-1989, an estimated one million pcoplein the United States were infected with human im-munodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causesAIDS. Many have no symptoms; they look and feelhealthy. Because HIV infection can exist for yearsbefore any symptoms develop, some people may noteven know they are infected with the virus. Anyone 8who has the Orus can infect others, whether the in-fected person shows symptoms or not.Research indicates that about fifty percent ofthose infected may develop AIDS within seven to tenyears after infection, and that, eventually, all or near-ly all HIV-infected persons become ill in some waybecause of their infection. Authorities project hiatby 1992, 365,000 persons will have developed AIDS,and 263,0(X) will have died. In 1992 alone, apredicted 66,000 persons with AIDS (called \"PWAs\"or \"PLWAs\" for persons living with AIDS) will die:That is more than the number of Americans whodied in combat during the 11 ycars of the VietnamWar.Accurate information and effective education areour best strategies to prevent the spread of HIV andreduce the number of deaths from AIDS. Curativetreatments and preventive vaccines will take manyyears to develop. For the foreseeable iuture, thc bestway we can interrupt the transmission of HIV will beby changing personal behaviors. Education can helpto effect this change by increasing our understandingof how the virus is spread. This, in turn, can reduceunnecessary fears about AIDS.Educators must have complete and accurate infor-mation about HIV and AIDS. Educators can play aunique role in preventive education. AIDS? HIV? WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? The diseaseAIDSis a serious impairment in aperson's natural immunity against disease. The dis-ease AIDS usually has its onset years after the15 person gcts infected with the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV). HIV is thc virus that causesAIDS, and it is HIV that is spread through sexualintercourse, sharing drug needles, and blood contact.Thc spread of HIV can happen regardless of whetherite infected person feels sick or has any othersymptoms. A person who is infected with HIV isdiagnosed as having AIDS aftcr the onset of certainsevere illnesses.HIV infccts and kills certain types of white bloodcells that help protect Vie body from infections.People infect.,d with HIV are vulnerable to seriousillnesses caused by bacteria, fungi, viruses, andprotozoa, as well as some forms of cancer. These ill-nesses, which are usually not a threat to people withnormally functioning immune systems, are called \"op-portunistic\" because they need the opportunity of aweakened immune system to cause serious illness. Itwas unexpected clusters of cascs of these opportunis-tic illnesses in previously healthy young men in 1981that first led to thc recognition of AIDS byepidemiologists.HI V is a retrovirus. Retroviruses species-specific, which mcans that HIV only infects humans(the \"H\" in HIV) and not animals or insects. HIVuoes not survive for long in the environment and can-not reproduce itself outside the human body; it is notspread through thc air. Ordinaty chlorine bleachand water will destroy HIV. The way HIV is trans-mitted is through direct contact with blood, semen,or vaginal secretions of an infected person. This con-tact is most often made through sexual intercoursewith an infected person, the sharing of IV needleswith an infected person, and from an infected motherto her baby during pregnancy, childbirth, orbreastfeeding. HOW IS HIV TRANSMITTED? HIV is transmitted by sexual intercourse, needlesharing by drug users, and pregnancy. HIV does notdiscriminate; anyone can become infected. A persondoes not have to be gay, live in a big city, or be a druguser to become infected with HIV. All a person hasto do is have sex with or reuse a needle used by some-one who has the virus in order to become infected,too.Sexual Tri LAnission HIV can be passed from infected men to women andfrom infected womcn to mcn through vaginal inter-coursc (penis in vagina). The virus can also bepassed from infected men to othcr mcn or to womcnthrough anal intercourse (penis rectum, or mouth increase thelikelihood of HIV transmission.Some questions remain unanswered about thesexual transmission of HIV. For example, we are notsurc why somc sexual partners of HIV-infected per-sons have not become infected despite repeatedsexual exposures. Scientists also have not yet fullydocumented how thc virus gets from onc sex partnerto the other during vaginal intercourse, but theybelieve the presence of other infections of the penis,vagina, or cervix (the canal that leads to thc uterus,or womb) is a risk factor. There is evidence that thevirus is transmitted through oral sex (contact be-tween the penis, vagina, or anus and the mouth);therefore, this sexual activity cannot be said to berisk-free.With HIV, as with almost all sexually transmitteddiseases, thc risk of infection increases with the num-ber of sexual patinas. If a person does not havesexual intercourse and does not use IV needles, he orshe cannot become infected. There is a vety smallrisk (less than 1 in 40,000) of transmission of HIVthrough a blood transfusion, Couples who are not in-fected with HIV, who have sex only with each other,and who do not use IV needles or need blood treat-ments also have no risk of infection. Safer SexAbstinence (not having sexual intercourse) andmutual monogamy amg uninfected couples (sexualrelationships with onc partner for an extendedperiod, such as in marriage) arc the only 1(X) percenteffective ways to avoid contracting HIV throughsexual contact. The term \"safer sex\" describes anysexual contact that does not allow any contact withblood, semen, and vaginal secretions. Latex con-doms (rubbers)because they prevent contact withsemen and vaginal secretionscan help prevent thespread of HIV through sexual intercourse, The effec-tiveness of condoms may be enhanced if they areused with a spermicide such as nonoxynol-9, which .916 has been shown to kill HIV in laboratoiy tests. Con-doms and spermicidal foams, gels or other forms canbe easily found in drug stores, pharmacies, and otherstores or ordered through the mail.For full protection, a condom i lust be used fromstart (when erection begins) to finish for each inter-course experience. Each condom can only be usedonce. Condoms should not be stored for extendedperiods of time in warm places (like a pocket wallet)because the heat can weaken them. Condoms madeof latex offer better proteuion than those made fromnatural membranes, often called \"lamb skins,\" be-cause the virus is less likely to penetrate latex. Theuse of lubricants in conjunction with condoms candecrease the chances of tears in the condom or thevagina or rectum. Oil-based lubricants (likepetroleum jelly) can cause latex to break and shouldnot be used. Water-based lubricants (K-Y Jelly, forexample) are preferred because they do not damagecondoms.Condoms can prevent other sexually transmittedinfections that may increase a person's susceptibilityto HIV. Condoms, however, are not foolproof; theireffectiveness is lost if they are not used every time aperson has sex or if they break, leak, or are not usedproperly. Transmission of HIV from Injected Blood Because small amounts of blood remain in needlesor syringes after injection, sharing equir Inuit alreadyused to inject drugs of any kind into someone's bodyisextremely risky.Any equipment that is not sterilewhether it is used for self-medication, shooting illicitdrugs, injecting steroids, piercing ears, or tattooingmay be contaminated with HIV or other harmfulgerms.Studies of IV drug users in a few cities show thatas many as 60 percent have been infected with HIV.Sharing needles among groups of people in \"shoot-ing galleries\" is especially dangerous because manypeople share or rent a single needle.Many illicit drugs are addictive and carry serioushealth risks along with the risk of HIV infectionduring needle sharing. If you use drugs, get help tostop. You can get help by talking with your parents,doctor, pastor, or school counselor or calling a na-tional hotline. The NIDA sponsored drug helplinenumber is 1-800-662-HELP. If you cannot stop, donot share needles, or at least clean them with bleachand water before each use.Before 1985, people who received blood andblood components were at risk for infection withHIV. This occurred before scientists discoveredIIIV. Some of the transfusion recipients, as well aspaticnts with hemophilia who used blood clottingmedicine made from donations of blood plasma,have developed AIDS, accounting for 3 percent oi allAIDS cases. Since 1985, all U.S. blood and plasmadonations have been tested for evidence of HIV in-fection. As a result, blood transfusions are muchsafer.If you received blood transfusions between 1978and 1985, you should discuss this with your physicianor a counselor in a public health clinic. Transmission During Pregnancy A pregnant woman with HIV infection can pass t!'evirus to her baby during pregnancy, delivery, orthrough breastfeeding.Children born with HIV will probably develo'AIDS and become seriously ill. For this reason, awoman with even a slight risk of being infected withHIV should have counseling and an HIV antibodytest before becoming pregnant. A woman is at greatrisk if she has ever used IV needles or has had sexwith IV drug users or with men who have had inter-course with other men.Pregnancy itself may worsen serious healthproblems for women with HIV infection. Womenwho are infected with HIV should ask their doctorsabout the full range of family planning options avail-able to them to avoid risking their health.What Is Safe?A person does not become infected with HIV byshaking hands, hugging, kissing, crying, coughing,sneezing, or giving or receiving massages. Onealso does not contract the virus from water in poolsor baths, lakes or oceans, from food or beverages,from bed linens, towels, cups, dishes, straws, orother eating utensils, or from toilets, doorknobs,telephones, office equipment, or furniture. HIV isnot transmitted through vomit, sweat, stool, or nasalsecretions. Although the virus has been isolatef, invery small concentrations in tears, urine, and salivaof some persons who are infected with HIV, people1017 do not become infected with HIV through contactwith these fluids. However, many other germs arepassed by such contact. Therefore, lack of HIV riskis not an excuse for low standards of cleanliness andgood personal hygiene. In addition, a person cannotget HIV from mosquito or other insect bites. (Un-like mosquito-transmitted viruses or parasites, suchas yellow fever and malaria,HIV does not completeits life cycle or reproduce in these other insects.)If you have a particular question about HIV trans-mission, call the National AIDS Hotline:1-800-342-AIDS, Spanish: 1-800 -344-SIDA,TTY: 1-800-AIDSITY or your local AIDS Informa-tion resources such as the city or county healthdepartment. HOW CAN HIV INFECTION BEPREVENTED? If you are not infected with HIV now, there is noreason for you to ever become infected. You canprevent becoming infected with HIV by stopp:ag thepassage of the virus from an infected person to you.Because HIV is most frequently transmitted by shar-ing needles or through sexual intercourse, you canprotect yourself by making good decisions aboutyour own behaviors.Specifically, the U.S. Public Health Service recom-mends the following steps for everyone to reducetheir chances of becomhig infected with HIV: Recognize that abstinence or mutuaimonogamy is the best protection againstsexual transmission of HIV. Do not have sexual intercourse with non-monogamous partners or with persons whohave multiplc t)artners--including female ormale prostitutes. The more partners youhave, the greater your risk of infection.Using conemms correctly can reduce risk. Do not have sexual intercourse with personswith AIDS, persons who have engaged inrisky behaviors, or persons who have testedpositive for HIV antibodies. Rememberthat many persons with HIV infection lookand feel healthy, but are capable of transmit-11ling HIV to their sex partners. You cannottell by a person's appearance whether he orshe is infected. Using condoms can reducerisk of HIV transmission.From start to finish of each sexual contact,use a latex condom. Adding a spermicide,such as one containing nonoxynol-9, mayprovide extra protection.Avoid sexual activities that c mid cause cutsor tears in the liningof the rc.:tum, vagina,or penis. Anal (STD). If you t)ave a STD or havehad sex with someone who has one, see yourphysician or public health clinic, or call theNational STD Hotline: 1-800-227-8922.Do not use IV drugs. Do not share, borrow,or reuse needles or syl ingesfor any kind ofdrug, including steroids. If you need infor-mation about where to receive counseling tostop using drugs, call toll-free NationalAIDS Hotline: 1-800-342-AIDS, help prevent thc spread ofHIV by starting education programs, with special em-phasis, :ri activities for people most likely to engagein high-risk behaviors. WHAT IS THE RISK FORHETEROSEXUALS? AIDS was once widely viewed as a \"gay disease.\" Weknow that this is not true; HIV can be spreadthrough vaginal intercourse from a man to a womanand from a woman to a man. In a study of spouses ofpersons infected with HIV, most :;pouses who did notabstain from intercourse or use condoms became in-fected with HIV even when they only practicedvaginal intercourse. Consistent use of condomsgreatly reduced !he frequency of HIV transmission tothese spouses who were uninfecteResults of studies in certain African countrieswhere equal numbers of men and women have con- tracted HIV infection have shown that heterosexualsare susceptible to HIV. In these countries,heterosexual intercourse is believed to be the majortransmission mode in the spread of HIV. Multiplesex partners, the presence of other sexually trans-mitted diseases, and sex with prostitutes also seem toincrease the risk of HIV infection.The number of new AIDS cases related to HIVtransmission through heterosexual intercourse is in-creasing much/inter than cases related tohomosexual intercourse. Abstinence, mutualmonogamy, and condom use are the only ways tostop the further sexual transmission of HIV. HOW DO CHILDREN GET AIDS? In the United States, more than 2,500 children underage 13 have been diagnosed with AIDS. Even morehave other serious illnesses resulting from HIV infec-tion.Approximately 80 percent of chldren with AIDSwere infected by their mothers during pregnancy ordelivery; 19 percent receiN ed contaminated trans-fusions or clotting facto,. concentrate before theblood supply was screened. IS THERE DANGER OF A CHILDCONTRACTING HIV FROM FRIENDS ORSCHOOLMATES? NO, Although transmission might occur as theresult of direct exposure to the blood of an infectedchild, no cases of HIV infection are known orsuspected to have been transmitted from one child toanother in school, daycare, or foster care settings.The U.S. Public Health Service recommends that,except in very unusual circumstances, children whohave HIV infection or who have AIDS \"should be al-lowed to attend school and after-school daycare and(when necessary) to be placed in a foster home in anunrestricted setting.\"Each child's case should be evaluated individually,with special attention to the child's needs and theparticular setting. Decisions affecting the schoolingof an HIV-infected child should be made in the samemanner as decisions for any child with special healthproblems. HOW CAN EDUCATION HELP US STOPTHE SPREAD OF HIV? A major strategy to stop the spread of HIV andAIDS is education to improve our individual under-standing of the virus and how it is transmitted. Theultimate goal of health education is to change thosebehaviors that can transmit HIV.Educational programs can have noteworthyresults. For example, education within gay com-munities has reduced the frequency of riskybehaviors among gay men and has also radicallyslowed the rate of new HIV infections in some areas.People who usc drugs and share needles havebeen more difficult to influence through educationalprograms. Moreover, many licterosexuals do notbelieve they can become infected, and thus continueto practice high-risk behaviors. WHAT IS THE HIV ANTIBODY TEST? What many people call the \"AIDS blood test\" is nota direct test for AIDS itself. Although there areseveral licensed tests, each of them detects the samething: antibodies to HIV.Antibodies are proteins that a person's immunesystem produces in response to an infectionin thiscase, infection with HIV. There are different typesof HIV antibody tests. The ones most commonlyused include maytake two weeks to several months for antibodies toHIV to develop, so if somebody has recently been in-fected with HIV, they may not show antibodies whentested. However, any infected person is still capableof transmitting HIV to others, despite a negativeantibody test. SHOULD I GET TESTED? If you think you have been at risk for HIV infectionyou should strongly considerbeing tested. There aredirect and specific medical benefits for early detec-tion of HIV infections. Once a person gets sick fromHIV, the medical treatments may not be as effective.Still, the decision to be tested is personal, and shouldbe made after discussing this question with a per-sonal physician or counselor. If you arc consideringbeing tested, discuss this with your physician or otherqualified counselor or health care provider. If youneed information on where to find counseling andtesting services, contact your local or state HIV Pro-gram Coordinator, or localAIDS informationhotline. You can also call the National AIDS Hot-line: 1-800-342-AIDS. WHAT IS THE TESTING PROCEDURE? After the person receives counseling and gives con-sent to be tested, a blood sample is drawn from thearm. The ELISA test is done first because it is themost sensitive of available tests. To minimize thepossibilities of a false-positive result, a positiveELISA test should be repeated to confirm the result.If the ELISA result is repeatedly positive, furthertesting should be donesuch as with the WesternBlot or the IFA test. These more specific antibodytests are used to confirm repeatedly positive ELISAresults. Two positive ELISA tests backed up by apositive Western Blot or IFA test indicate thepresence of HIV antibodies. WHAT DO THE TEST RESULTS MEAN? Negative HIV Antibody Results A negative test result means that a person has notdeveloped antibodies to HIV. It usually takes 6-12weeks after infection to develop HIV antibodies.For this zeason, if you have engaged in any risky be-haviors in the months before the test, a negative testresult may not reflect lack of HIV infection, butrather, recent infection and insufficient time fordevelopment of HIV antibody, and further counsel-ing with possible retesting is recommended.A negative test result does not mean that some-one is immune to HIV andAIDS or that they cannotbecome infected in the future. Positive HIV Antibody Results A positive test result means that a person has beeninfected with HIV, will remain infected, and cantransmit HIV to others:through anal, vaginal, or oral sex; by sharing needles;perinatally (to a baby before or during birth)or possibly through breastfeeding; by donating blood, plasma, semen, tissue, orbody organs.A positive test result does not necessarily mean:hat a person has AIDS. Available data suggest,though, that the great majority of persons with HIVinfection will develop AIDS in the absence ofspecific treatment. Nonetheless, many people whohave tested pos.itive, while still being capable of in-fecting others, have remained healthy for years afterinfection.If you decide to take thc HIV antibody test, coun-seling is strongly recommended, both before andafter the tcst, to help you identify other services youmay need and where you canobtain them and to helpyou sort out your feelingsand maintain a healthy life-style.Whether you takc thc test or not, and whateverthe results, you should avoid putting yourself at riskin the future. Do not engage in risky activities. Al-ways practice safer sex and never use needles. HOW CAN SOMEONE GET TESTED? Confidential counseling and HIV antibody testingare widely available on avoluntary basis. Counselingoccurs both before and afterthe test.Testing is often available at clinics or alternativehealth sites, or through public health departments.132 0 Testing can also be accomplished through privatephysicians or some biomedical laboratories. Youmay have to make an appointment, and there may bea wait.For more information on the HIV antibody tests,including what the medical benefits arc and where toget counseling and testing, contact the AIDS hotlinefor your state, or the national AIDS hotline (1-800-342-AIDS). ARE TEST RESULTS KEPT PRIVATE? Different states have varying policies on HIV an-tibody testing. Many offer the tests free On either a\"confidential\" or \"anonymous\" basis. Some offerboth. Testing isconfidentialwhen someone givestheir name, and their test results becomepart of their confidential medical records.Public health departments have an excellentrecord of maintaining confidentiality of theclients/patients they serve. Their manydecades of expe7iftnce with confidential STDrecords have shown they are able to main-tain a high degree of confidentiality. Withanonymoustesting, a person does notreveal their name; instead, a code and ornumber is used which must be presented inperson at the test site to receive the results.This arrangement ensures that only you getthe results. If you lose or forget your code,there is no way to match your result withyour blood sample. You will have to pro-vide a new blood sample to learn yourinfection status. GUIDELINES FOR HANDLING BLOODAND OTHER EDDY FLUIDS IN SCHOOLS Very simply, it is good hygiene policy to treat allspills of body fluids as infectious in order to protectpersonnel from becoming infected with any germsand viruses. The procedures outlined below offerprotection from many types of infection, not justHIV, and should be followed routinely.14How Should Blood Be Handled? Wear disposable, waterproof gloves whenyou expect to come into direct hand contactwith blood or blood-tinged substances(when treating bloody noses, handlingclothes soiled by blood, or cleaning smallspills by hand). Gloves used for this pur-pose can be put in a plastic bag or linedtrash can, sealed, and disposed. Handsd be washed with soap and warm watergloves are removed. If you have unexpected contact with bloodor if &yes are not available (for example,when applying pressure to a bleeding injuryoutside the classroom, or helping a studentin the bathroom), you should wash yourhands and other affected skin with soap andwater after the direct contact. This is recom-mended as a general hygiene measure, notjust for HIV infection. Handle any bloody disposable items (tissues,paper towels, and bandages, for example) with glovesand dispose of these items in the same manner asused gloves. How Should Urine, Feces, and VomitusBe Handled? Most schools already have standard procedures inplace for removing urine, feces, -ind vomitus substan-ces. These policies should be reviewed to determinewhether appropriate cleaning and disinfection stepshave been included. HandwashingProper handwashing requires the use of soap andwarm water and vigorous washing under a stream ofrunning water for at least 10 seconds. If handsremain visibly soiled, more washing is required.Scrubbing hands with soap will suspend easily remov-able soil and microorganisms, allowing them to bewashed off. Running water is necessary to carry awaydirt and debris. Rise your hands under runningwater and dry them Nith a clean cloth, paper towelsor a blow dryer.21 DisinfectantsA solution of 99 parts water to 1 part householdbleach (or 1/4 cup bleach added to one gallon ofwater) is effective, .,nexpensive, and readily available.It or other EPA-registered germicides should beused to clean spills or contaminated surfaces. Higheiconcentrations of bleach can be corrosive, and arc un-necessary unless a surface is heavily soiled withorganic material and cannot be precleaned before dis-infection. Always follow label directions carefullyand do not mix chemicals,Disinfecting Hard Surfaces and Caring forEquip-witAlter removing the soil, apply a germicide (like thebleach/water solution described above) to the equip-ment used. Mops should be soaked in this solutionafter use and rinsed thoroughly with warm water.Non disposable cleaning equipment (such asdustpans and buckets) should also be rinsed in agermicidal solution, The solution should bepromptly discarded down a drain pipe. Removegloves and discard them in appropriate receptacles,and wash your hands as described above.Laundry Instructions for Clothing Soiledwith BloodContaminated clothes may be laundered with soapand water or dry cleaned. Pre-soaking may bc re-quired for heavily soiled clothing. Otherwise, washand dry as usual, following the directions provided bythe manufacturer of the laundry detergent. If thematerial can bc bleached, add 112 cup of householdbleach to the wash cycle. If the material is not color-fast, add 112 cup of non-chlorine bleach to the washcycle.

The resolutionsfrom the National Congress on Parents and Teachers(PTA) cover a range of issues including informationdissemination, testing blood supplies, and placementof students infected witn HIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DOMESTIC POLICYCOUNCIL'S PRINCIPLES FOR AIDSEDUCATION The following principles were proposed by theDomestic Policy Council and approved by the Presi-dent in 1987: Despite intensive research efforts, preven-tion is the only effective AIDS controlstrategy at present. Thus, there should be anaggressive federal effort in AIDS education.The scope and content of the school portionof this AIDS education effort should be lo-cally determined and should be consistentwith parental values.The federal role should focus on developingand conveying accurate health informationon AIDS to the educators and others, notmandating specific school curriculum on16this subject, and trusting the Americanpeople to use this information in a mannerappropriate to their community's needs.Any health information developed by thefederal government that will be used foreducation should encourage responsiblesexual behaviorbased on fidelity, commit-ment, and maturity, placing sexuality withinthe context of marriage.Any health information provided by thefederal government that might be used inschools should teach that children shouldnot engage in sex, and the informationshould be used with the consent and involve-ment of parents. Note: Permission granted to photocopy these prin-ciples. AAHE STATEMENT REGARDING HIVINFECTION PREVENTION EDUCATION AIDS, a serious health problem, is currently an issueof concern to many Americans. The Association forthe Advancement of Health Education recommendsthat accurate and current information about AIDSbe a part of a comprehensive school health educationinstructional program. Because AIDS research infor-mation is changing rapidly, it is imperative that theeducational process utilize professionally trainedhealth educators. Note: Permission rinted to photocopy this statement.'23 STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL HEALTHCARE NEEDS (CEC, 1988) The Council for Exceptional Children believes thathaving a medical diagnosis that qualifies a student asone with a special health care need does not in itselfresult in a need for special education. Students withspecialized health care needs are those who requirespecialized technological health care procedures forlife support and health support during the schoolday.The Council believes that policies and proceduresdeveloped by schools and health care agencies thatserve students with special health care needs should(1) not exclude a student from receipt of appropriatespecial education and related services; (2) not ex-clude a student from receipt of appropriateeducational services in the least restrictive environ-ment; (3) not require educational agencies to assumefinancial responsibility for non-educationally relatedmedical services; (4) define clearly the type, nature,and extent of appropriate provider; (5) assure thatplacement and service decisions involve interdiscipli-nary teams of personnel knowledgeable about thestudent, the meaning of the evaluation data, andplacement options; (6) promote a safe learning en-vironment, including reasonable standards for aclean environment in which health risks can be mini-mized for all involved; (7) provide assurance thathealth care services are delivered by appropriate andadequately trained personnel; (8) provide ap-propriate medical and legal information about thespecial health care needs of students for all staff; (9)provide appropriate support mechanisms for stu-dents, families, and personnel involved with studentswith special health care needs; and (10) provide ap-propriate and safe transportation,The Council for Exceptional Children believesthat special education personnel preparation andcontinuing education programs should provideknowledge and skills related to: (1) the nature andmanagement of students with special health careneeds; (2) exemplary approaches and models for thedelivery of services to students with special healthcare needs; and (3) the importance and necessity forestablishing support systems for students,parents/families, and personnel.Recognizing that this population of students isunique and relatively small, The Council for Excep-1724tional Children still believes that the manner inwhich policies are developed and disseminated re-lated to students with special health care needs iscritically important to effective implementation. Indevelopment of policy and procedure for this low-incidence population, the following must beconsidered integral to any such process: (1) that itcan be developed throughcollaborative efforts ofhealth and education agencies at state, provincial,and local educational, health, and legal require-ments; (3) that it provides for frequent review andrevision of intervention techniques and programsas a result of new knowledgeidentified through re-search, program evaluation and monitoring, andother review mechanisms; (4) that policies aresupported by data obtained from medical andeducational professions; (5) that policy developmentis easily understandable by students, professionals,and the public at large; and (6) that policy develop-ment and dissemination should be a continualprocess and disassociated from pressures associatedwith precipitating events.

MANAGING COMMUNICABLE ANDCONTAGIOUS DISEASES (CEC, 1991) Controlling the spread of communicable and con-tagious diseases within the schools has always been ap thlem faced by educators, the medical profession,and the public. Effective policies and procedures formanaging such diseases in the schools have historical-ly been developed by health agencies andimplemerted by the schools. These policies and pro-cedures were primarily designed to manage acute,temporary conditions rather than chronic conditionswhich require continuous monitoring and removechildren from interaction with other children whilethe condition is contagious or communicable.Recent public awareness of chronic infectiousdiseases such as those with hepatitis B-virus,cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and humanimmunodeficiency virus have raised concerns, neces-sitating the reassessment or at least clarification ofschool policies and procedures. The Councilbelieves that having a chronic infection does not in it-self result in a need for special education, Further, The Council believes that schools and public healthagencies should assure that any such infectious andcommunicable disease policies and procedures: a.Do not exclude the affected child from thereceipt of an appropriate education evenwhen circumstances require the temporaryremoval of the child from contact with otherchildren. b.Provide that determination of a non-tem-porary alteration of a child's educationalplacement should be done on an individualbasis, utilizing an interdisciplinary/interagen-cy approach including the child's physician,public health personnel, the child's parents,and appropriate educational personnel. e.Provide that decisions involving exceptionalchildren's non-temporary alterations ofeducational placements or services con-stitute a change in the child's IndividualizedEducation Program and should thus followthe procedures and protections required.Recognize that children vary in the degreeand manner in which they come into contactwith other children and school staff. e.Provide education staff with the necessary in-formation, training, and hygienic resourcesto provide for a safe environment for stu-dents and educational staff. f.Provide students with appropriate educationabout infectious diseases and hygienicmeasures to prevent the spread of such dis-eases. g.Provide, where appropriate, infectedchildren with education about the additionalcontrol measures that they can practice toprevent the transmission of the diseaseagent. h.Enable educational personnel who are medi-cally at high risk to work in environmentswhich minimize such risk. i.Provide educational personnel with ade-quate protection for such personnel and18their families if they are exposed to such dis-eases through their employment. The Council believes that special education per-sonnel preparation programs should a. b.Educate students about infectious diseasesand appropriate methods for their manage-ment. Counsel students as to how to determinetheir level of medical risk in relation to cer-tain diseases and the implications of suchrisk to career choice. The Council believes that the manner in whichpolicies for managing infectious (communicable andcontagious) diseases are developed and disseminatedis important to their effective implementation.Therefore the following must be considered integralto any such process: a.That they be developed through the col-laborative efforts of health and educationagencies at both the state, provincial, andlocal levels, reflecting state, provincial andlocal educational, health and legal require-ments. b.That provision is made for frequent reviewand revision to reflect the ever-increasingknowledge being pwduced through re-search, ease reports, and experience. e.That policies developed be based on reliableidentified sources of information and scien-tific principles endorsed by the medical andeducational professions. d.That policies he understandable to a varietyof consumers including students, profes-sionals, and the public. e.That policy development and disseminationbe a continual process and disassociatedfrom pressures associated with precipitatingevent.s.

PTA CHECKLIST FOR A GOODAIDS CURRICULUM The answer to each question should be Yes. Is the curriculum right for the age of thechild? Children go through stages. The cur-riculum must be right for the stage. Does the curriculum help younger studentsget past their fear of AIDS? In grades 6 and up, students can talk aboutsex and health in more detail. Does the20curriculum for the younger students (K-5)build a foundation for this? Does the curriculum say that sexual feelingsare okay? Does the curriculum teach young children torefuse to allow someone to touch them if thetouch is unwanted: Does the curriculum tell students how toprevent getting HIV and AIDS?Does the curriculum encourage students notto engage in sexual intercourse.' Does the curriculum support students whodo not want to have sex? Does the curriculum tell all students howcondoms prevent AIDS if they do have sexin the future? Does the curriculum use woids the studentsunderstand? Does the curriculum put stress on high-riskbehaviors, not high-risk groups? Does the curriculum state strongly thatanyone can get HIV and AIDS, regardless ofrace, sex, age or whether the person isheterosexual or homosexual? Students need a lot of time to learn and ab-sorb and act on this new information. Is27 there plenty of time (several class periods)for each student to learn the skills to makehealthy decisions?Does the program pick teachers whom stu-dents trust and who are comfortable talkingabout AIDS and sex? Does it train teacherswell?Do the non-English-speaking students getthe same information in their own language? Is the same information given to studentswith vision and hearing problems and physi-cal handicaps?Are the students taught in small groups?Does sonieone update the curriculum asnew information becomesavailable? Will parents, students and other communitypeople help set up the AIDS education pro-gram?Is there ongoing talk with parents about thecurriculum?Note: Permission granted to photocopy the checklist.
