Reviews and validates data, Maintains communications between the project and participating parties, and Coordinates with BOW management, BOW public engagement, and BOW web page for public presentation of data. 5 DHEC Assistant Project Manager Assists the Project Manager with implementation of the sampling plan and coordinates the aquatic biology tissue project component. These responsibilities include developing and planning the freshwater fish sampling schedule and assisting the Project Manager in coordinating with SCDNR and the DHEC Shellfish Program. Surface Water Coordinator Assists the Project Manager with implementation of the surface water component of the sampling plan. These responsibilities include scheduling field sampling activities for the central office component and assisting in responding to inquiries from BEHS regional staff. Quality Assurance Manager Reviews and approves the QAPP on behalf of the BOW and BEHS. Provides general guidance on quality assurance issues that arise during the project. Sampling Logistics - Surface Water and Aquatic Biology Sampling and logistics personnel work with the Project Manager to coordinate and conduct sampling activities including laboratory coordination, shipping, sample collection, training, and other logistics activities. The field component of this project will begin July 2022 and complete in June 2023 and is subdivided into four components: 1. BEHS regional office surface water sampling of ambient monitoring base sites. Sixty-five (65) actively-monitored base sites were selected for surface water PFAS sampling as part of this project. These sites will be sampled quarterly (Q3 2022, Q4 2022, Q1 2023, and Q2 2023) as part of routine sampling conducted by BEHS regional office field staff. For this program, the regional staff will collect only surface water samples for PFAS (i.e., no additional supporting chemistry in addition to routine monitoring parameters). 2. Central office surface water sampling of additional water quality sites. Forty-one (41) additional monitoring sites were selected for surface water PFAS sampling. These sites include a mix of former statistical survey network locations (stream, lake, and coastal), macroinvertebrate stations, special study sites, and nine new locations selected as part of this study to target key features. These sites will also be sampled quarterly for surface water PFAS. In addition, samples for supporting chemistry (total organic carbon, alkalinity, turbidity, total suspended solids, and hardness) and field parameters (temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and specific conductivity) will be collected to characterize the physical state of these sites as they are not routinely sampled as part of the ambient monitoring base site network. 3. Central office sampling of inland/freshwater fish. Twenty-one (21) sites will be sampled for PFAS concentrations in fish tissue. Each site will be sampled once with the possibility of a second targeted event if the results from the first sampling event warrant. At these sites, up to three species will be sampled for PFAS in whole fish or filet portions. Filet portions will be tested primarily in fish species consumed by humans. 6 4. Coastal oyster and blue crab sampling coordination with DHEC Shellfish Program and South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. Twenty-four (24) active shellfish monitoring sites distributed among the 20 coastal shellfish management areas will be sampled for PFAS concentrations in oyster tissues. Sampling at these sites will be coordinated with DHEC Shellfish Monitoring Program. Twenty (20) locations will be sampled for blue crab whole tissue PFAS concentrations. Seventeen (17) of the blue crab sites are routine trawl, creek trawl, and crab pot locations sampled by South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR). Sampling of these sites will be coordinated with SCDNR staff. Three (3) additional blue crab locations near Myrtle Beach/Murrells Inlet will be sampled by DHEC central office staff using crab pots. Each site will be sampled once with the possibility of a second targeted event if the results from the first sampling event warrant. Record Keeping The Project Manager will create and maintain a repository for documents and data generated as part of this project. Sampling Teams Parties responsible for ensuring that field sampling activities are conducted in accordance with the QAPP. These parties include BEHS regional field staff, BOW and ASP field staff from Central Office, DHEC Shellfish Program staff, and SCDNR fisheries staff. Public Communications The Public Communications lead with communicate sampling results to the public and ensure that the BOW PFAS web page and social media are current. Web Page and Social Media The Web Page and Social Media lead will maintain the BOW PFAS page as directed by BOW management. GEL Project Manager The GEL Laboratories Project Manager will be the primary contract laboratory contact for the DHEC project team and will assist in facilitating sampling, handling, and delivery of samples and help address logistics issues that may arise. 7 Figure 1. Project organizational chart. A5. Problem Definition/Background Brief Background on PFAS in Environmental Media PFAS are a broad class of more than 3,000 man-made organic chemicals. Production of these compounds began in the 1940s. The chemical properties of PFAS give them the unique ability to repel both oil and water and as such have been widely used in commercial products. Commercial uses for PFAS include coatings for nonstick cookware, food packaging, stain-resistant fabrics, water-resistant clothing, and metal plating. PFAS are also used in firefighting foams (aqueous film forming foam, AFFF), cosmetics, and industrial surfactants. PFAS compounds are highly persistent in the environment and resist degradation. Hence, PFAS chemicals are commonly referred to as forever chemicals . Among the documented sources of PFAS to the environment, four are considered primary sources: fire training/response sites (military bases, civilian airports), industrial sites, landfills, and wastewater treatment plants. PFAS have been found in the blood of animals and humans worldwide. The primary non-occupational route of exposure to PFAS is diet, meaning PFAS may also pose ecological risks as they are present in most food webs. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry notes possible associations between specific PFAS and several health outcomes including liver damage, increased total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia, thyroid disease, decreased antibody response to vaccines, increased risk of asthma, decreased fertility, and decreased birthweight. PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment due to their long-standing use in consumer, commercial, and industrial products and applications. Because the compounds are stable and mobile, they can be present in most environmental media including air, soil and sediment, groundwater, surface water, and biota (plants and animals). However, the distributions and concentrations of PFAS in environmental media are dependent on proximity to a potential source of release, nature of the source, and local geology, hydrology, and water chemistry. 8 An enhanced discussion regarding the nature and history of PFAS use, environmental fate and transport of PFAS chemicals, ecological and human health impacts associated with PFAS exposure, and a regulatory overview of PFAS is presented in the Strategy to Assess the Impact of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances on Ambient Surface Waters in South Carolina (Surface Water Strategy) included as Appendix A of this QAPP. Problem Definition This QAPP represents the field sampling plan following guidance presented in the Surface Water Strategy. The purpose of the Surface Water Strategy was to guide the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) in assessing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the State's surface waters and address the question: How widespread are PFAS in ambient surface waters and related aquatic media within the State of South Carolina? The prevalence of PFAS in the environment in South Carolina is largely unknown, including in surface water and associated biota. The Surface Water Strategy identified a series of 48 priority Hydrologic Unit Code - 10 (HUC-10) level watersheds distributed across each major river basin within the State based on past and present sources that may have released or may release PFAS to the environment (Figure 1). Those sources include current and former industrial sites, airports, military bases, landfills, WWTPs, and agricultural fields used for land application of biosolids. The watersheds were selected by major river basin to ensure adequate representation throughout the State. The Surface Water Strategy presented a scalable framework from which the State can: 1) evaluate which release sources may be impacting ecological integrity and pose human health concerns; 2) determine which areas of the State may be most impacted by PFAS; and, 3) identify what environmental media may be accumulating PFAS (and what type of PFAS). A specific sampling plan will be developed for each of the priority watersheds based on the number of potential PFAS sources and types present, source relationships to the river and stream network, size (class) of the waterways, and feasibility and accessibility of target areas. Based on these considerations, specific media (surface water and finfish/shellfish) for testing will be determined. The results of this screening level program will be communicated to the public and will inform future DHEC actions related to addressing possible human health and ecological impacts associated with PFAS exposure. 9 Figure 2. HUC-10 level watersheds identified as key to addressing the Surface Water Strategy's primary objective. The watersheds are distributed across each of the major river basins in SC. 10 A6. Project/Task Description Surface Water Sampling DHEC will test quarterly for a suite of PFAS and PFAS precursor compounds at 106 locations distributed across the state and guided by the 48 priority HUC-10 level watersheds identified in the Surface Water Strategy. This total also includes several sites in watersheds identified as controls. Control watersheds are free, or mostly free, of potential PFAS release sources, identified in the Strategy. If a control watershed contains a potential PFAS source, the control sampling locations occur in a different HUC-12 level watershed or upstream of the possible release source. Sample locations are presented in Appendix B of this QAPP. Stream flows, hydrology, and geochemical conditions ( e.g., water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH) in South Carolina exhibit seasonal trends and are related to prevailing climate and seasonal weather patterns. In general, winter conditions tend to result in higher rainfall totals, increased stream flows, lower water temperatures, and higher dissolved oxygen levels, while summer weather tends to be drier and warmer which yields reduced stream flows, warmer water temperatures, and lower dissolved oxygen levels. These seasonal differences in weather impact stream flushing, stream metabolic rates and assimilation capacity of organic matter, and stream chemistry. It is expected that quarterly sampling at each location will capture seasonal variability in ambient temperature and stream flow conditions at the sampling sites. Sampling will begin in the third quarter of 2022 and end after the second quarter of 2023 (one year field program duration). If the sampling plan becomes delayed, it may be necessary to extend the field program (or a component of the program) to ensure project completeness. While this outcome is not anticipated, a decision on a possible extension will be made by the Project Manager and respective parties. Freshwater Finfish Sampling Finfish will be collected at two to three freshwater locations in each major river basin at least once over the course of the field program. In total, 21 locations have been identified. At each site, up to three fish species or composites of the same species will be analyzed for PFAS in either whole fish (if non-human consumption species or human consumption species) or filet (if human consumption species) components. The freshwater finfish component will begin in the third quarter of 2022. Freshwater finfish sampling locations are identified in Appendix B. Coastal Oyster Sampling Composite oyster samples representing approximately 12 individuals will be collected by the DHEC Shellfish Program at 24 actively monitored shellfish sites along the coast. Sampling will occur at each selected location once or twice over the course of the field program with sampling anticipated to begin in the third quarter of 2022. Oyster sampling locations are identified in Appendix B. Coastal Blue Crab Sampling Composite blue crab samples representing approximately three individuals will be collected as part of routine South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR) sampling (trawls or crab pots) from Winyah Bay south or by DHEC central office staff (crab pots) north of Winyah Bay. Samples will be collected by SCDNR at eleven estuarine and two creek trawl locations in August and four crab pot locations in October. DHEC central office will collect samples using crab pots at three locations in the fourth quarter of 2022 or first quarter of 2023. The number and size distribution of the composite sample collected at 11 each of these locations is contingent on the results of the trawls or crab pot deployments. Blue crab sampling locations are identified in Appendix B. Sample Analysis Surface water, freshwater finfish tissue, oyster tissue, and blue crab tissue samples will be processed and analyzed for 25 PFAS compounds following GEL Laboratories modified liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method (GL-OA-E-076 Rev. 12) utilizing isotope dilution for enhanced precision an accuracy applicable to Department of Defense Quality Systems Manual Table B15.1 A copy of the proprietary laboratory standard operating procedure (SOP) for PFAS analysis is stored on a secure DHEC server. A list of the 25 PFAS compounds is identified in Appendix C. Project and QA Records/Reports Upon analysis, the laboratory will send an electronic report to the Project Manager for review and validation. These reports will be stored on DHEC server that is backed up regularly. Sample results will be aggregated in a working repository that will also be stored on a regularly backed up DHEC server as well as uploaded to an internal SharePoint site. A7.

Training The Project Manager will distribute a guidance document on PFAS sample collection and handling procedures compliant with the laboratory requirements. This document will be reviewed and signed by each field sampler. The Project Manager will ensure that the central office sampling team has met the training requirement. The BEHS regional field sampling program will ensure that the regional office sampling teams have reviewed the guidance document. No special certification is required. The guidance document is included as Appendix E of this QAPP. A9. Documentation and Records The Project Manager will distribute the official, approved QAPP and any necessary subsequent revisions to individuals listed in the distribution list identified in A3. Contract Laboratory - PFAS Sample and Supporting Chemistry Laboratory Records The format of all data reporting will be consistent with the requirement and procedures for an Analytical Support Level II data quality assessment, which consists of results, completed chain of custody form, and sample narrative. Data will be submitted via email to the Project Manager. Data will be stored and backed up by the laboratory and BOW per each entity's normal procedures and retention schedules. As information is returned from the laboratories, summary reports will be submitted via email to project management. 15 DHEC - Supporting Field and Chemistry Laboratory Records No additional laboratory samples or field data will be collected by regional office field teams as part of this project aside from the quarterly PFAS surface water samples. All supporting chemistry samples collected by the central office field teams will be analyzed by the contract laboratory. All field data collected by the central office field teams will be recorded in a field log and maintained on the DHEC server. Upon completion of the project, the Project Manager will submit a written report to management that details the results of the project. The report will be stored electronically in accordance with the Department's record retention policy. Section B. Measurement/Data Acquisition B1. Sample Process Design The field component will begin in July 2022 and end in June 2023. The project is divided into quarterly components (Q3 2022, Q4 2022, Q1 2023, and Q2 2023) for surface water sampling. Stations for this study were selected to support the objectives outlined in Section A5. The sampling strategy was developed to capture a variety of flow features throughout the year. Because it is not possible to target each surface water site during a rain induced flushing event, it is expected that quarterly samples will capture varying flow patterns dictated by seasonal weather conditions. In total, 106 locations were identified for analysis of surface water PFAS. Of the total, 65 sites are active ambient monitoring base sites and 41 are DHEC sites that are not currently active or are new sites. Reconnaissance has been completed at each of these 41 sites to determine road feasibility and stream access. The surface water chemistry sites are listed in Appendix B. The BEHS regional offices will collect water samples for PFAS analysis at the active base sites as part of their routine visits to those sites on a quarterly basis. These samples will be either shipped directly to the contract laboratory or couriered to the central office where the Project Manager and central office team will route samples to the contract laboratory. No additional samples (i.e., supporting chemistry) are planned for regional staff beyond current ambient monitoring sampling. The remaining 41 sites will be sampled quarterly for PFAS, supporting chemistry, and field parameters by central office staff of the BOW ASP and TMDL groups. Each team will be provided two surface water sampling rigs to be used for PFAS sampling only: 1) a stainless steel sampling container with 60 feet of stainless steel chain for bridge sampling and 2) a stainless steel sampling container affixed to a 5-foot PVC arm that is extendable to eight feet with a 3-foot attachment for boat and stream bank sampling. The 21 inland fish sampling sites will be sampled once with the possibility of a second sample event if initial PFAS results warrant. These sites will be sampled by central office BOW ASP and TMDL staff. At each site up to three species will be collected. Samples will include either a single individual of the same species or composite of multiple individuals of the same species. Testing for PFAS may occur in either or both whole fish and filet tissue of the fish sample depending on the quality and quantity of the available species following electrofishing. In total six samples may be collected per site. Sampling the 24 coastal shellfish sites for oysters will be conducted by and coordinated with DHEC Shellfish Program. Sampling of these sites is expected to occur in July and August. After collection, each sample (a composite of approximately a dozen individuals) will be packaged in aluminum foil or 16 HDPE container and transmitted to the central office either through the DHEC courier service or direct pick up by central office staff. Composite blue crab samples representing approximately three individuals will be collected as part of routine South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR) sampling (trawls or crab pots) from Winyah Bay south or by DHEC central office staff (crab pots) north of Winyah Bay. Samples will be collected by SCDNR at eleven estuarine and two creek trawl locations in August and four crab pot locations in October. DHEC central office will collect samples using crab pots at three locations in the fourth quarter of 2022 or first quarter of 2023. The number and size distribution of the composite sample collected at each of these locations is contingent on the results of the trawls or crab pot deployments . After collection, the samples will be packaged in aluminum foil or HDPE container and transmitted to the central office through direct pick up by central office staff. Specific dates for sampling each surface water, inland finfish, and coastal shellfish site will be coordinated following discussions with respective groups. Sample delivery to the contract laboratory will occur as soon as possible following the sampling event to meet holding times. The holding times are 14 days and 28 days for surface water and tissue (if frozen), respectively. All measurements made during this study are crucial to the meeting the primary objective of this study. The results of this study and other studies within the State will enhance the understanding of PFAS distributions and potential human health and ecological consequences of these chemicals. Anticipated sources of natural variability A primary aim of this study is to capture PFAS concentrations in surface water under a variety of flow conditions as dictated by seasonal weather patterns. Seasonal variations in pollutant input to streams and rivers and resulting concentrations are most influenced by local variations in weather. Precipitation can: 1) increase pollutant concentrations in surface water through groundwater discharge and overland flow; 2) decrease pollutant concentrations through dilution and flushing, and 3) increase turbidity through increased sediment load to surface water and sediment resuspension. Accessibility If a sampling site proves to be inaccessible, sampling will be postponed at that site until the site can be accessed. The Project Manager and responsible field sampling crew will jointly evaluate and select a replacement site if necessary. This situation is not anticipated, however, as each site selected for this study is either actively monitored by BEHS, DHEC Shellfish Program, or SCDNR or has been evaluated by central office staff. B2. Sampling Methods Requirements For surface water samples, equipment and supplies that will be needed to perform the sampling are certified pre-cleaned polyethylene 250-milliliter (mL) sample containers for PFAS surface water samples, sample bottles for additional surface water chemistry (central office only), weather- and waterproof labels, chain of custody forms, indelible ink pen/marker and shipping coolers for return to the laboratory. GEL Laboratories requires each surface water sample consist of two 250 mL bottles. These requirements are in addition to the sampling rigs and associated materials described above. For collection of freshwater finfish, oysters, and blue crabs, equipment needed will be the same as routine sampling for the respective groups. Each group will be provided 1) heavy duty aluminum foil, gallon-sized 17 HDPE bags, and HDPE sturdy sampling containers for sample storage based on the size of the sample. This guidance follows discussions with GEL Laboratories on best practices for tissue sample storage. Because PFAS are used in a wide variety of consumer products (e.g., cosmetics, water- and oil-repellent clothing, laundry softeners, fast food wrappings), the sampling teams will be made aware of proper preparation, collection, and handling during the pre-mobilization training session. In addition to proper pre-sampling personal preparation (e.g., clothing, cosmetics, etc.), the sampling teams will wash hands before sampling each system and will wear nitrile gloves during sample collection. An expanded discussion on pre-sampling and sampling protocols is presented in the field sampling guidance document (Appendix E of this QAPP). As stated above, DHEC staff from the central office and the regional offices will be collecting the samples and transmitting them to the contract laboratories. The sample collection procedures will be followed according to the methods, and shipping will be completed using the appropriate laboratory protocols. Sampling containers, PFAS-free certified water for field blanks, and chain of custody forms will be provided by the contract laboratory. Field Quality Control Prior to the start of the field program, up to six equipment blanks will be prepared and submitted by the central office staff and Project Manager as a check on possible background PFAS concentrations associated with the stainless steel surface water sampling gear. Field blanks will be periodically collected as part of the surface water program by BEHS regional staff and central office staff. Two field blanks will be submitted by each region each quarter and two field blanks will be submitted by the central office field team each quarter. The field blank will be prepared by dispensing PFAS-free water provided by the laboratory into a sample container in the field and sent with field samples. The field blanks will be handled just as the investigative samples are handled to identify potential problems associated with field collection procedures. B3. Sample Handling and Custody Field personnel will be responsible for PFAS sample collection, handling and preservation, and chain of custody following all applicable protocols. Surface water PFAS samples will be the first samples collected at each site to minimize the risk of contamination. PFAS samples will be recorded on a chain of custody form provided by the contract laboratory. Surface water samples will be collected using either a stainless steel bridge (chain and sampling container) sampling rig or streambank/boat PVC (handle and extender) and stainless steel (sampling container) sampling rig to be distributed by the Project Manager/central office. Contract laboratory supporting chemistry collected by central office sampling teams will be recorded on a chain of custody form provided by the laboratory. Supporting field measurements collected by central office sampling teams will be documented in a PFAS-dedicated field log. All surface water samples will be placed on ice immediately after collection in the field. Sample bottles will be procured from the contract laboratories and will be labeled prior to sample collection. Labels will include station ID, date, time of collection, and sampler name. Following sample collection, freshwater fish samples (either individual specimens or composites of the same species) will be measured for length and immediately wrapped in aluminum foil or placed in an HDPE bag and stored on ice until return to the central office laboratory. After return to the 18 laboratory, samples will be frozen and transmitted to the contract laboratory as soon as possible with the chain of custody form. Following sample collection, oyster samples (a sample from each site consists of approximately one dozen individuals) will be measured for length and immediately placed in an HDPE bag and stored on ice until return to the laboratory. After return to the laboratory, samples will be frozen and transmitted to the central office with the chain of custody form. Central office staff will coordinate oyster sample transmittal to the contract laboratory. The contract laboratory will be responsible for shucking, processing, and homogenizing the oyster composite samples. Following sample collection, blue crab samples (a sample from each site consists of approximately three individuals) will be measured for carapace length, chilled to reduce mobility, placed in an HDPE bag, and frozen. After return to the laboratory, samples will be transmitted to the central office with the chain of custody form. Central office staff will coordinate blue crab sample transmittal to the contract laboratory. The contract laboratory will be responsible from picking, processing, and homogenizing the blue crab samples. The chain of custody will specify whether the sample will be all soft tissue (offal) or edible tissue. Sample delivery to the contract laboratory will occur as soon as possible following the sampling event to meet holding times. The holding times are 14 days and 28 days for PFAS surface water (unfrozen) and tissue (if frozen) samples, respectively. Holding times and preservation for additional water quality parameters collected by the central office sampling teams: o TOC - 28 days and acidified to ph<2 using sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, or hydrochloric acid o Hardness - 180 days and acidified to ph<2 using nitric acid o Alkalinity - 14 days and unpreserved o TSS - 7 days and unpreserved o Turbidity - 48 hours and unpreserved B4. Analytical Methods Requirements Laboratory analytical methods are adequate for the quality objectives outlined in Section A7. GEL Laboratories turnaround time for PFAS samples is approximately 10 days. This turnaround time is sufficient to meet program objectives. B5. Quality Control Requirements SC DHEC Quality Control requirements for field work and laboratory analysis are detailed in the EA SOP and QC Manual, SOP for Quality Control of Analytical Performance (Section II, October 2014), Section 7: Wastewater Facility and Ambient Monitoring (Revision 3.1, January 2012), and Section 14: Field Measurable Physical/Chemical Characteristics (Revision 4.1, August 2015) as discussed above. Quality Control requirements for daily use of multi-parameter sondes are detailed in Section 14 of the EA SOP and QA Manual (14.10 Multi-parameter Meters). For continuous monitoring, the Quality Control requirements are detailed in the SOP for Continuous Monitoring of Ambient Surface Water. EPA has established protocols for the analysis of Quality Control (QC) samples with each analytical batch of PFAS samples, generally defined as a maximum of twenty samples. All QC results must be assessed and evaluated by the laboratory on an on-going basis. Method-specific QC acceptance criteria must be used 19 to determine the validity of the data. The on-going QC samples must meet the acceptance criteria specified in GEL Laboratories modified liquid chromatography mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS) method utilizing isotope dilution for enhanced precision an accuracy and DoD QSM Version 5.3. For analytical testing, the laboratory includes positive control samples (Laboratory Fortified Blank) to evaluate the total analytical system. Negative control samples [Laboratory Reagent Blanks (LRB)] are used to assess the preparation batch for possible contamination during the preparation and processing steps. A blank is considered contaminated with any result equal to or greater than the analyte reporting limit. Specific control samples [Laboratory Fortified Matrix (LFM)] are used to indicate the effect of the sample matrix. Replicates (LFM, LFM duplicate) are performed to assess the precision of the results generated. Specific information regarding the frequency, composition, acceptance criteria and corrective actions is documented in the laboratory's specific standard operation procedure (SOP) for implementation of the modified LC-MS/MS method, as well as their SOPs for the support chemistry parameters (i.e., TOC, alkalinity, hardness, TSS, and turbidity). Samples that have exceeded the holding time or temperature requirements will be flagged and analyzed. Analytical results will be reviewed to determine if sample recollection is necessary. B6. Instrument/Equipment Testing, Inspection, and Maintenance Requirements All laboratory equipment will be tested, calibrated, and maintained in accordance with SOPs maintained by the contract laboratories. Regular cleaning and maintenance of the Hydrolab DS5X, YSI EXO2, In-Situ Aqua Troll 600 field meters are performed by field personnel according to Section 14 of the EA SOP and QA Manual (14.10 Multi- parameter Meters), the User's Manual for the instruments. An instrument that does not meet routine maintenance checks or fails calibration will not be used. B7. Instrument Calibration and Frequency Instrument calibration and frequency will be performed in accordance with the respective analytical method, SOP, and QC documents. The sondes used for in situ measurements are calibrated at the beginning of each field day and verified at the end of each field day according to the EA SOP and QC Manual Section 14: Field Measurable Physical/Chemical Characteristics (Revision 4.1, August 2015) and Appendix document to the EA SOP and QA Manual (A3.0 Oxygen by Luminescence using the Hydrolab DS5/DS5X). B8. Inspection/Acceptance Requirements for Supplies and Consumables Sample containers for surface water samples are purchased pre-cleaned. Sample containers are one-time use and provided by the contract laboratory with appropriate preservatives, if necessary. Consumables, standards reagents, and supplies required by each analytical laboratory are the responsibility of that laboratory based on the analytic procedure. Standards must be NIST internally traceable or standards must be prepared using Certified American Chemical Society reagent grade chemicals appropriate to the specific analytical equipment. 20 Laboratories will follow testing and reporting procedures in accordance with appropriate analytical methods as described above. B9. Non-Direct Measurements Internal/external secondary data are not required for this project. B10. Data Management Contract Laboratory Following sample collection, samples will be packed and shipped along with chains of custody following procedures outlined in Section B2. Analytical results in the form of a final report for each sample delivery group will be sent via e-mail from the laboratory to the Project Managers. Results will be maintained on DHEC's internal server which is backed up daily. Section C. Assessment and Oversight C1. Assessment and Response Actions Identification of problems related to technical performance is the responsibility of all project team members. The Project Manager will assess problems that arise in the field. If necessary, modifications to technical procedures may be considered. Any changes to technical procedures will be documented and, if necessary, discussed with the Quality Manager. GEL's equipment, SOPs, and quality documents for the support chemistry parameters are evaluated by DHEC's Office of Environmental Laboratory Certification on a triennial basis. The laboratory must pass proficiency tests for these parameters each year. The contract laboratories will perform self-audits and institute corrective actions in accordance with their respective written records. The contract laboratory must inform the DHEC project manager any time logistical and analytical issues arise that may affect the quality of the sample data. C2. Reports to Management Reports regarding data quality are included in the certificate of analysis or via email. Corrective actions for field issues are included in the field logbooks along with a narrative about the issues. The Project Manager will meet with team members as needed to discuss project status and take corrective action. As mentioned in Section A4. Project/Task Description and B10. Data Management, the Project Manager is responsible for collating data and ensuring validation is performed on data received from all sources. The Project Manager is responsible for contacting the analytical laboratories if there are problems with data quality or completeness in the data received (missing values, a high percentage of data not meeting QC criteria) and resolving any recurring data problems. Refer to Section D2 below for further details. The Project Manager is responsible for correcting problems that arise in the field. 21 Section D. Data Validation and Usability D1. Data Review, Verification, and Validation All sample chain of custody forms and field logbooks will be reviewed by the Project Manager after each sampling event. Any errors/discrepancies noted will be brought to the attention of the field samplers for resolution. The Project Manager will be responsible for implementing any corrective actions needed. Items that will be reviewed are: Sample Collection Records reviewed: Daily field logs and chain of custody forms Responsible party: Field samplers, Assistant Project Manager Discrepancies reported to: DHEC Project Manager Sample Receipt Records reviewed: Chain of custody forms from field sampler Responsible party: Laboratory Sample Custodian Discrepancies reported to: DHEC Project Manager Sample Analysis Records reviewed: Laboratory results Responsible party: Laboratory Director Discrepancies reported to: DHEC Project Manager Error/Corrective Actions Records reviewed: Reports from Responsible party: Project Manager/Data validator Discrepancies reported to: DHEC Project Manager Laboratory Data Verification The Project Manager will evaluate the contract laboratory data packages against complete laboratory/field results to determine if any supporting observations may provide insights into unexpectedly high or low analytical results. The Project Manager will review analytical results and determine any limitations on the use of the data and include these limitations in the Final Report. D2. Validation and Verification Methods Data quality review of all contract laboratory-generated data is performed by a secondary laboratory analyst not associated with the primary measurement operation for the analytical batch, but knowledgeable in the analytical process. It is the responsibility of the reviewer to ensure that all data are correct and of known and documented quality. Once the review is complete, the reviewer will sign and 22 data the QA/QC checklist according to the laboratory SOP. Limitations on the use of data will be communicated to the laboratory director and the DHEC Project Manager. D3. Reconciliation and User Requirements If the review stages prescribed in this QAPP are satisfied and the data are determined to be sound, the data are deemed usable for the purpose intended. If any data are determined to be unusable by the Project Manager, those data will be removed from the project database and re-sampling will be considered. D4. Reporting, Documents, and Records All documents will be maintained electronically by the Project Manager on routinely backed up DHEC servers.

The Strategy has identified a series of 48 priority watersheds distributed across each major river basin within the State based on past and present sources that may have released or may release PFAS to the environment. The watersheds were selected by major river basin to ensure adequate representation throughout the State. The results of this screening level program will be communicated to the public and will inform future DHEC actions related to addressing possible human health and ecological impacts associated with PFAS exposure. PFAS are a broad class of more than 3,000 man-made organic chemicals. Production of these compounds began in the 1940s. The chemical properties of PFAS give them the unique ability to repel both oil and water and as such have been widely used in commercial products. Commercial uses for PFAS include coatings for nonstick cookware, food packaging, stain-resistant fabrics, water-resistant clothing, and metal plating. PFAS are also used in firefighting foams (aqueous film forming foam, AFFF), cosmetics, and industrial surfactants. PFAS compounds are highly persistent in the environment and resist degradation. Hence, PFAS chemicals are commonly referred to as forever chemicals . Among the documented sources of PFAS to the environment, four are considered primary sources: fire training/response sites (military bases, civilian airports), industrial sites, landfills, and wastewater treatment plants. PFAS have been found in the blood of animals and humans worldwide. The primary non-occupational route of exposure to PFAS is diet, meaning PFAS may also pose ecological risks as they are present in most food webs. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) notes possible associations between specific PFAS and several health outcomes including liver damage, increased total and low- density lipoprotein cholesterol, pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia, thyroid disease, decreased antibody response to vaccines, increased risk of asthma, decreased fertility, and decreased birthweight. PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment due to their long-standing use in consumer, commercial, and industrial products and applications. Because the compounds are stable and mobile, they can be present in most environmental media including air, soil and sediment, groundwater, surface water, and biota (plants and animals). However, the distributions and concentrations of PFAS in environmental media are dependent on proximity to a potential source of release, nature of the source, and local geology, hydrology, and water chemistry. As such, a specific sampling plan will be developed for each priority watershed based on the number of potential PFAS sources and types present, source relationships to the river and stream network, size (class) of the waterways, and feasibility and accessibility of target areas. Based on these considerations, specific media ( e.g., surface water, finfish, shellfish) for testing will be determined. The Surface Water Strategy presents a scalable framework from which the State can: 1) evaluate which release sources may be impacting ecological integrity and pose human health concerns; 2) determine which areas of the State may be most impacted by PFAS; and, 3) identify what environmental media may be accumulating PFAS (and what type of PFAS). 1 Introduction Background on Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a broad class of more than 3,000 synthetic fluorinated (carbon-fluorine bonds) organic chemicals. PFAS are man-made and do not occur naturally. Production of these compounds began in the 1940s. The chemical properties of PFAS give them the unique ability to repel both oil and water and as such have been widely used in commercial products. Commercial uses for PFAS include coatings for nonstick cookware, food packaging, stain-resistant fabrics, water-resistant clothing, and metal plating. PFAS are also used in firefighting foams, cosmetics, and industrial surfactants (Wang et al. 2017). Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) were the two most widely used PFAS compounds. Though now phased out of commercial and industrial production, PFOS and PFOA remain the two most widely studied PFAS chemicals. PFOS and other PFAS chemicals were used in the production of aqueous film forming foam (AFFF). AFFF has been widely used to extinguish hydrocarbon fires and are prevalent particularly in the vicinity of military bases, firefighting training facilities, airports, and petroleum refineries. Further, due to the ubiquitous presence of PFAS in everyday commercial products, the waste stream from landfills, industrial facilities, municipal sludge and treated effluent from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), and septic systems represent important source pathways for PFAS entry into the environment. PFOS, PFOA, and other PFAS compounds are highly persistent in the environment and resist degradation. Hence, PFAS chemicals are commonly referred to as forever chemicals . However, PFAS chemicals were not documented in wildlife tissues until the early 2000s (Giesy and Kannan 2001) despite widespread use for more than a half century. In recent years, awareness of the presence of these chemicals in the environment, their tendency to bioaccumulate and biomagnify in the food chain, and their potential to impact human health has increased prompting the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to release drinking water health advisories for PFOS and PFOA in 2016 (81 CFR 33250). Since then, state and tribal governments have recognized more broadly the importance of PFAS in the environment and to, varying degrees, developed or implemented study plans to assess drinking water and surface water or to adopt drinking water standards such as Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs). In January 2020, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) Bureau of Water (BOW) released the State's study plan (Drinking Water Strategy) to assess PFAS concentrations in all 583 public/community water systems (CWS) as well as in potentially vulnerable private wells located in susceptible aquifers or near potential sources of PFAS to the environment (DHEC 2020). Environmental Fate and Transport Sources and Transport Certain PFAS are no longer manufactured in the United States, including PFOS and PFOA. In 2002, 3M voluntarily phased out production of PFOS. In 2006, the EPA PFOA Stewardship Program invited eight leading PFAS manufacturing companies to reduce PFOA emissions by 95% by 2010 and all emissions by 2015. All companies successfully met the goal of the program (EPA 2016, 2018). There are no current facilities known to produce PFAS in South Carolina; however, PFAS may be, or have been, used in industrial processes or to produce commercial/consumer products in South Carolina. 2 Among the documented sources of PFAS to the environment, four are considered primary sources: fire training/response sites, industrial sites, landfills, and wastewater treatment facilities/biosolids (ITRC 2018). The Department of Defense (DOD) bases, Department of Energy (DOE) facilities, civilian airports, and firefighting training facilities used AFFF for decades to extinguish hydrocarbon fires. Multiple AFFF formulations have been produced over the years. The fluorosurfactants in AFFF are produced by electrochemical fluorination or fluorotelomerization processes, both of which contain a diverse mixture of PFAS (Barzen-Hanson et al. 2017). AFFF was used at these sites for a variety of reasons and at different rates. The pathways of release of PFAS to the environment from firefighting activities include through atmospheric dispersion and deposition; diffusion, dispersion, advection and transformation of precursors in sediment, surface water, soil, and groundwater; and transformation of precursors in biota (ITRC 2018). Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAA) are a PFAS subgroup which includes PFOS and PFOA. PFAA precursors are a broad class of polyfluorinated compounds ( e.g., alcohols, acids, amides) that when transformed yield a PFAA terminal product. Industrial sites include both facilities that produce or synthesize PFAS containing products and secondary manufacturing facilities. Secondary manufacturing facilities are those that use PFAS containing compounds in production of commercial goods, such as those identified above, or in industrial processes. The pathways for industrial release of PFAS to the environment are similar to fire/training response sites except that industrial facilities may treat wastewater on-site or send wastewater to a WWTP. The treated wastewater may be land applied or discharged to surface water. Uncontrolled releases of PFAS from industrial sites may also occur. Landfills and non-permitted disposal sites may harbor PFAS-containing consumer goods, industrial waste, and sludge/biosolids from WWTPs. A composite liner has been a requirement for newly constructed municipal solid waste, construction and demolition, and industrial landfills since the 1990s (40 CFR 258.40). Landfills constructed prior to this did not require a liner and, thus, may present a higher potential for release of PFAS to the environment. The release pathways of PFAS to the environment from disposal facilities are similar to industrial sites as landfill leachate may either be treated on-site or diverted to a WWTP. Uncontrolled releases may also occur. Municipal and industrial WWTP facilities can release PFAS to the environment as direct point source discharge, through facility malfunctions, as sludge/biosolids waste production, and through atmospheric deposition if the facility incinerates waste. Further, PFAA may be produced from oxidation of precursors during the treatment process. The composition and concentration of PFAS in these various environmental pathways are functions of the WWTP's influent, biological and chemical transformation of substances to intermediate or terminal degradation products, and physical/chemical partitioning. The application of industrial and municipal biosolids as a soil amendment to agricultural fields represents an emerging and potentially important spatially distributed (nonpoint) source of PFAS to groundwater, sediment, soil, surface water, and biota (DHEC 2019). Partitioning and Transformation The PFAA group of PFAS is generally the most studied due to their widespread use and documented presence in environmental media. PFAA are commonly divided into two categories: short-chain and long- chain based on the number of carbons present in the chemical. PFOS (sulfonate head) and PFOA 3 (carboxylate head) are considered long-chain PFAA as both have an eight-carbon tail. The widespread environmental presence of PFAA is attributed to the tendencies of the hydrophobic (water repelling) and lipophobic (lipid repelling) fluorinated tail (carbon-fluorine bonds) and the polar (electrostatically charged) and hydrophilic (water attracting or soluble) heads of the chemicals. Specifically, these properties lead to important partitioning mechanisms including hydrophobic effects, electrostatic interactions, and interfacial behaviors. Long-chain PFAA are more strongly sorbed and have a higher potential for bioaccumulation than short-chain chemicals (Conder et al. 2008). However, in general, PFAA are relatively mobile in groundwater and associate with the organic fractions of soil and sediment. PFAA are less volatile than other PFAS but can be transported in the atmosphere and can be generated by transformation of volatile precursors. PFAA generally do not degrade or transform under ambient environmental conditions but may be formed through transformation of more volatile precursors by abiotic and biotic processes. Hydrolysis, photolysis, and oxidation have been noted to transform precursor compounds to PFAA under ambient conditions. While the PFAA group is also resistant to microbial degradation, numerous aerobic, and, to a lesser known extent, anaerobic biotransformation pathways exist to transform volatile precursors to PFAA. Ecological and Human Health Impacts Certain PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment due to their long-standing use in consumer, commercial, and industrial products and applications. Because the compounds are stable and mobile, they can be present in most environmental media including air, soil and sediment, groundwater, surface water, and biota (plants and animals). However, the distributions and concentrations of PFAS in environmental media are dependent on proximity to a potential source of release, nature of the source, and local geology and hydrology. The body of literature on bioaccumulation and biomagnification of PFAS in the environment is increasing, particularly as state agencies implement their own studies. PFOS was first identified in animal tissues in the early 2000s. Giesy and Kannan (2001) quantified PFOS in fish, birds, and marine mammals in both urban and rural environments. Tissue concentrations were greater in urban environments, but the presence of PFOS in rural tissue samples indicates widespread distribution of the chemical. Subsequent studies have identified high concentrations of PFOS and other PFAA in migratory bird egg yolk (Yoo et al. 2008) and in resident marine organisms (Yoo et al. 2009) near industrial sources. Contaminant concentrations in egg yolk and soft tissue of marine organisms (blue crab) decreased as a function of distance from the source of discharge. In recent years, states have identified high concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in filets of omnivorous and carnivorous fish near military installations and in large rivers (Michigan DEQ, 2017). PFOS and PFOA were detected in the majority of composite fish filet and liver samples representing species across multiple trophic levels and in the eggs of osprey, a piscivorous bird (WA Dept. of Ecology 2008, 2016). In the Charleston area (Harbor and tributaries) of South Carolina, PFAS were detected in all six fish species analyzed, with PFOS concentrations of certain fish species exceeding human health screening values (Fair et al. 2019). PFOS was the most abundant chemical detected in each fish species, representing 26-70% of the total PFAS concentration. These high PFOS concentrations across a variety of fish species indicate a high potential for bioaccumulation in human food chains. It should be noted, however, that the most recent total-dietary data (generally, from the 2016 to 2018 period) published by the US Food and Drug Administration did not reveal widespread occurrence of PFAS in surveyed foodstuffs (FDA 2020). 4 Because PFAS are present in the environment and in animal tissues across multiple trophic levels, these chemicals can bioaccumulate and biomagnify in humans, particularly in vulnerable or dependent populations. PFAS have been found in the blood of animals and humans worldwide and the primary non- occupational route of exposure to PFAS is diet. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found PFOS, PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulphonic acid (PFHxS) in the blood serum of nearly all Americans tested through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) since 1999. From 1999 to 2014 blood levels of PFOS and PFOA have declined by more than 80% and 60%, respectively, concurrent with the phasing out of these chemicals (ATSDR 2019). Further, blood serum concentrations of these chemicals have continued to decrease since 2014 (CDC 2021). However, currently used PFAS compounds not monitored in blood in this study may have replaced discontinued PFOS and PFOA. In a recent USGS study, PFAS compounds were ubiquitously detected at low levels in a tapwater survey in Chicago (Bradley et al. 2020) and in treated water in a national scale survey of water treatment plants (Boone et al. 2019). Most studies examining the impacts of PFAS compounds on human health are cross-sectional and do not establish causality. However, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) used a weight- of-evidence approach to evaluate links between PFAS and a particular health effect (ATSDR 2018). The ATSDR draft report indicates possible associations between specific PFAS and several health outcomes: PFOS and PFOA - liver damage, increased total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia, thyroid disease, decreased antibody response to vaccines, increased risk of asthma (PFOA only), decreased fertility, and decreased birthweight PFHxS - liver damage and decreased antibody response to vaccines PFNA - increased total and LDL cholesterol Perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDeA) - increased total and LDL cholesterol and decreased antibody response to vaccines Objective/Purpose of This Strategy The objective of the Ambient Surface Water Strategy is to answer the question: How widespread are PFAS in ambient surface waters and related aquatic media within the State of South Carolina? The prevalence of PFAS in the environment in South Carolina is largely unknown, including in surface water and associated biota. The Surface Water Strategy will screen for PFAS in environmental media at or near locations of current and former sources that may release or may have released PFAS to the environment. Those sources include current and former industrial sites, airports, military bases, landfills, WWTPs, and agricultural fields used for land application of biosolids. This screening level program is not meant to be an exhaustive spatial characterization of PFAS in ambient waters, but a focused survey of a series of targeted locations where PFAS may occur. The results of this program will provide insights into the prevalence of PFAS in the South Carolina environment. Further, these insights, along with the results of the BOW Drinking Water Strategy, will inform future DHEC actions related to addressing possible human health and ecological impacts associated with PFAS. At these locations, BOW will test for a group of selected PFAS in surface water and in biota using procedures and equipment that will minimize the potential for sample PFAS contamination. EPA has 5 developed and published in 40 CFR Part 136 EPA Method 537.1 and EPA Method 533, both for drinking water. Presently, there is no analytical method validated and approved in final form by EPA and published in Part 136 of the Code of Federal Regulations (40 CFR 136 2021) for acquisition of PFAS data from non- potable water ( e.g., wastewater, surface water, groundwater). EPA has developed SW-846 Method 8327 for non-potable water and is moving the method through the regulatory process for ultimate publication in 40 CFR Part 136 (USEPA 2021b,d). Additionally, EPA is collaborating with DOD to validate a solid-phase extraction/isotope dilution (SPE-ID) method which will include solid matrices ( e.g., sediment, fish tissue) in addition (USEPA 2021d). The SW-846 Method 8327 list of PFAS compounds is expected to include a combination of 24 short-carbon chain and long-carbon chain compounds that are known to occur or possibly occur in environmental media. Length of the carbon chain and attached functional group (polar head group) influence how the compound partitions in the environment and where it may be present ( e.g., in dissolved form in the water column or attached to sediment). Regulatory Overview, Other States' Efforts, and South Carolina Strategy USEPA Health Advisories and State-level Surface Water Criteria In 2016, EPA issued a lifetime drinking water health advisory of 70 ppt (parts per trillion, or nanograms per liter [ng/L]) for PFOS and PFOA, either individually or in combination (81 CFR 33250). A health advisory is not an enforceable standard, but is proposed to assist federal, tribal, and local managers of drinking water systems. In December 2019, EPA proposed a groundwater screening level of 40 ppt to determine if PFOS and/or PFOA are present at a site (EPA 2019). In this context, screening levels are used to determine if levels of contamination may warrant further investigation. Further, EPA adopted the drinking water health advisory (70 ppt) as a preliminary remediation goal (initial cleanup target) for groundwater that serves as a drinking water source. Some states have established drinking water regulatory, advisory, or guidance values for various PFAS. Please refer to Section II.E of the BOW Drinking Water Strategy (DHEC 2020) for a state-by-state summary of drinking water numeric limits and guidance for PFAS. On January 19, 2021, EPA announced a final regulatory determination to proceed with regulating PFOA and PFOS under the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act by development of MCLs and to include PFAS in the upcoming Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule 5 drinking water data collection (77 CFR 26072). These decisions have been reviewed by the new Presidential Administration with an announcement on February 22, 2021, of the intent to proceed with implementation of both. To date, only Michigan, Oregon, and Colorado have promulgated surface water criteria or advisory levels for PFAS (ECOS 2020, IRTC 2020). Michigan has adopted criteria of 11 ppt for PFOS and 420 ppt for PFOA in surface waters serving as drinking water sources and 12 ppt for PFOS and 12,000 ppt for PFOA in surface waters not used as a drinking water source (MI Rule 57 R 323.1057). In 2011, Oregon adopted wastewater initiation levels for five PFAS chemicals in WWTP effluent (OAR 340-045-0100). Concentrations greater than the initiation level require a pollution prevention plan that becomes part of a facility's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. In July 2020, Colorado promulgated surface water standards (translation levels) largely consistent with the EPA drinking water lifetime health advisories (5 CCR 1002-31, 1002-41 2020). In addition, Florida has proposed literature-based provisional cleanup target levels and screening levels for surface water, groundwater, soil, and irrigation water (Stuchal and Roberts 2019). Provisional surface water screening levels for the consumption of freshwater and estuarine finfish 6 and shellfish are 4 ppt for PFOS and 150 ppt for PFOA. These screening levels were developed based on human health considerations. Studies of PFAS in Surface Water Conducted by Other States Several states have evaluated PFAS contamination in environmental media associated with known sources of PFAS release. The following summary is not meant to be exhaustive but highlights important and pertinent findings for the development of the Surface Water Strategy. Minnesota has conducted widespread environmental sampling in the eastern Twin Cities (Minneapolis/St. Paul) metropolitan area (East Metro). The East Metro area includes a 3M facility and multiple disposal sites as well as inactive landfills. Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) testing identified that groundwater beneath the 3M Cottage Grove facility was contaminated with PFOA, PFOS, and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA). Sampling of sediments and sediment pore water near the site also revealed PFAS contamination. Further, PFAS from a 3M disposal site and an inactive landfill were found in neighboring creeks and lakes. In addition, these sites have created a large groundwater PFAS plume. From 2009-2011, MDH and MPCA conducted a survey of PFAS concentrations in areas exposed to AFFF use. Elevated levels of PFAS were found in nearly all media including wetland surface water and sediment near the Lake Superior Emergency Response Training Center, where Class B AFFF was used until 1996. Other firefighting sites sampled as part of this study including Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport and a Marathon refinery on the Mississippi River near St. Paul, both of which had groundwater concentrations detected below drinking water health values based on well sampling (Antea 2011). In 2012, Michigan received a Great Lakes Restoration Initiative grant to assess and correlate PFAS concentrations in surface waters and fish across the State. The study identified concentrations of PFOS (7- 50 ppt) in several large waterbodies including Flint River, Kalamazoo River, and Saginaw River as well as in bass from the Flint and Kalamazoo rivers. The highest surface water PFOS and PFOA concentrations (5,099 ppt and 1,309 ppt, respectively) were observed in Clark's Marsh, a wetland area near Wurtsmith Air Force Base (AFB). Sunfish collected from this waterbody and nearby Au Sable River yielded filet PFOS concentrations of 5,100 ppt and 166 ppt, respectively (MI DEQ 2017). The State of Washington conducted two statewide surface water PFAS studies in 2008 and 2016 (WA Dept. of Ecology 2010, 2017). These studies quantified a suite of PFAA in surface water from several freshwater systems across the State. The 2008 study returned at least one PFAA in every Spring sample and all but two in the Fall. The highest concentrations were observed in WWTP receiving waters with little dilution. PFAA were detected in seven of 15 freshwater systems sampled in 2016. The systems with detected PFAA were those receiving a higher relative proportion of wastewater discharge and located in more developed areas, including urban lakes. In streams receiving a relatively high input from a WWTP, short-chain PFAA were dominant consistent with discharger effluent samples. PFOS was detected in 40% of composite fish filets and in 67% of composite liver samples collected as part of the 2008 study. The composite samples were dependent on fish species present at a site. In 2016, PFAS (primarily PFOS) was detected in 86% of 22 the composite fish filets and in 100% of the 22 composite liver samples analyzed. As with the fish samples, PFOS represented most of the PFAS concentration found in osprey eggs indicating communication to higher trophic level organisms (WA Dept. of Ecology 2010, 2017). 7 As stated previously, this summary is not meant to be exhaustive, but provides meaningful background for the development of this Strategy. Based on these studies: PFAS concentrations may be present in the surface water and sediment of larger waterbodies, the presence of PFAS in surface water and groundwater is largely dependent on how AFFF was used and managed at firefighting or fire training facilities, the presence of PFAS in surface water and groundwater is largely dependent on the types of industry present within the watershed, the presence of PFAS in surface water and groundwater is related to industrial and municipal waste storage ( e.g., old landfills) within the watershed, PFAS can be exchanged between groundwater and surface water, waterways receiving WWTP with low dilution and/or high urban stormwater runoff tend to have higher PFAS concentrations, and PFAS, particularly PFOS, are present consistently in both fish filet and liver samples with a positive relationship between concentrations in biota and in surface water. DHEC Bureau of Water Strategy for PFAS in Drinking Water In January 2020, BOW released the State's Strategy to assess PFAS in drinking water. Over the course of 2020, BOW began testing PFAS levels in finished water (but prior to final treatment) in all 583 community water systems within the State. Further, BOW intends to offer testing of drinking water to private well owners that are identified as potentially at-risk. Vulnerability of private wells will be assessed based on the aquifer from which the well is drawing. BOW identified the Upper Coastal Plain and Piedmont aquifers as potentially at higher risk for groundwater contamination. Private wells will be prioritized and identified based on a ranking of the potential magnitude of PFAS (in terms of concentration ranges) for each source type (Section IV.A of the Drinking Water Strategy [DHEC 2020]). Please refer to the Drinking Water Strategy for further detail. Potential PFAS Sources in South Carolina The BOW Drinking Water Strategy adapted a recent literature review that assessed possible relative impacts of a source type on local groundwater (Guelfo et al. 2018). PFAS source types and magnitudes of PFAS concentrations are highly variable, but are useful in prioritizing, generally, where potential environmental impacts could be investigated. The following list characterizes the source type and prioritization by the Drinking Water Strategy and will be used, in part, to inform the selection of Surface Water Strategy sites. Note that not all potential PFAS sources characterized in Guelfo et al. (2018) are directly applicable to this Strategy or South Carolina. Please refer to Section III of the Drinking Water Strategy for an expanded discussion (DHEC 2020). Impact Rank 1: Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Energy (DOE) Facilities The primary source for PFAS release to the environment at DOD and DOE facilities is through the use of AFFF. PFAS have been confirmed at six facilities; results are pending or investigations are planned for four facilities; and, two sites have no documented use of AFFF (Joint Base Charleston-Weapons and Poinsett Electronic Bombing Range). 8 Impact Rank 2: PFAS or Fluoropolymer Manufacturing There are no current or past facilities in South Carolina known to produce PFAS or fluoropolymer chemicals. Impact Rank 3: Landfills There are 677 active and inactive landfills in South Carolina. Of the total, 79 are active construction and demolition (Class 2) landfills and 28 are active municipal solid waste (Class 3) landfills. The remaining 570 landfills are inactive Class 2 (133), inactive Class 3 (228), or inactive industrial (208). There is one inactive hazardous waste landfill in Pinewood, SC. Impact Rank 4: Airports There are eight Part 139 airports in South Carolina. All Part 139 airports are required to have aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) capabilities and are indexed from A to E (smallest to largest). The larger the airport the higher the ARFF requirements and as such Index E airports will likely have more AFFF on-site than Index A airports. South Carolina has three Index C airports (Charleston International, Greenville- Spartanburg International, and Myrtle Beach International), one Index B airport (Columbia Metropolitan), and four smaller Index A airports. Impact Rank 5: Fire Training Areas The South Carolina Fire Academy, a large and comprehensive fire training facility, operates a 208-acre facility north of Columbia. Before moving to its current location, the academy was located near Columbia Metropolitan airport. Impact Rank 6: Petroleum Refineries There are no known current or past petroleum refineries in South Carolina. Impact Rank 7: Industrial Sites The BOW Drinking Water Strategy identified 384 currently NPDES permitted industries that may be potential sources of PFAS to the environment. The Strategy used two criteria to assess potential industrial sources: process wastewater from the industry is discharged into a surface water through an NPDES permit, onto the land through a No Discharge (ND) permit, or to a municipal WWTP through a pretreatment permit and, the industry falls under a Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) code identified by EPA or that the BOW believes PFAS could be utilized in the production process. The 384 industries identified in the BOW Drinking Water Strategy by SIC code are organic chemicals, plastics and synthetic fibers (OCPSF) (65), pulp and paper (11), textiles (68), and airport and other (240). Given the persistent nature of PFAS in the environment, the list of potential industrial PFAS sources was expanded to include past, or not currently, permitted facilities for this Strategy. Additionally, the list was updated to include currently permitted facilities that may not have been permitted at the time the Drinking Water Strategy was developed. Also, each facility on the list was evaluated/re-evaluated based 9 on best professional judgement and current information regarding SIC codes that are associated with PFAS use (ASDWA 2020, NAICS 2018). Direct Discharges The evaluation included 684 current and terminated/closed individual industrial NPDES/ND permits. Of these, 399 were eliminated from further consideration based on SIC code or minimal flows ( e.g., car washes). The remaining facilities include current/former OCPSF (31), textiles (81), pulp and paper (11), landfills (10), federal facilities (9), fire protection (1), and other (164). Also, there are three historic facilities which the BOW was unable to characterize based on the limited remaining information on those facilities. Note that some of the terminated/closed facilities on the individual industrial NPDES permit list may have elected to obtain coverage under a general permit (GP). The GP universe includes 25 current and terminated/closed Bulk Petroleum Storage Facility NPDES GP coverages and 2,164 current and terminated NPDES/ND GP coverages of other types ( e.g., mining, hydroelectric, hydrostatic test water, pesticide application, petroleum contaminated groundwater, utility water, and vehicle wash water). Of the GP coverages, Bulk Petroleum Storage Facilities is the only category being carried forward for consideration in the Surface Water Strategy as these facilities may have currently or in the past used/stored fire suppressants containing PFAS. (Note that while vehicle wash water GP discharges may contain some PFAS, they are not expected to be large contributors due to the small flows associated with these discharges.) Pretreatment Publicly Owned Treatment Works Pretreatment programs reduce the level of pollutants discharged by industries and other nondomestic wastewater sources into publicly owned treatment works (POTWs). The BOW evaluated 566 pretreatment facilities that discharge to municipal WWTPs. The facilities were classified into categories which include OCPSF (78), textiles (41), pulp and paper (1), landfills (9), electroplating and metals (135), and other (302). These industrial pretreatment effluents are discharged to 76 individual municipal WWTPs. The number of pretreatment discharges to individual municipal WWTPs ranges from 1-60. Overall, 59 municipal WWTPs receive between 0-9 pretreatment discharges, 12 municipal WWTPs receive between 10-19 pretreatment discharges, and two municipal WWTPs receive between 20-29 pretreatment discharges. Two other municipal WWTPs receive between 30-39 and 40-49 pretreatment discharges, respectively. The WWTP with the most receives 60 pretreatment discharges for treatment. Impact Rank 8: Wastewater Treatment Plants The BOW Drinking Water Strategy identified 746 WWTPs in South Carolina. Of the total, 362 are either domestic (146, privately owned) or municipal (216, publicly owned) WWTPs. The remaining 384 are industrial facilities. The PFAS composition and concentration in the effluent or sludge of an individual domestic or municipal facility is dependent on the influent to the plant (residential vs. industrial) and the activities of the influent sources. Land Application of Treated Sludge Sites There are more than 2,000 sites across the State that receive sludge application at some frequency associated with NPDES or ND permits. For many of these sites, especially for larger facilities, there are often multiple application fields at each site. Land application of treated sludge/biosolids is an emerging concern for the BOW. Recently DHEC detected elevated levels of PFAS in soil from a series of agricultural 10 fields that received treated sludge from a former industrial source. Further, surface water and sediment collected adjacent to the fields contained significantly elevated levels of PFAS and nearby residential wells contained PFOS and/or PFOA concentrations greater than EPA's health advisory of 70 ppt (DHEC 2019). Private well sampling continues near some of the more than 9,800 acres that were permitted for land application from this facility. Given the high number of WWTPs (NPDES and ND permits) in the State, it is not possible to evaluate these facilities as a whole. EPA recommends that NPDES permits include requirements for phased-in monitoring and best management practices related to PFAS when these chemicals are expected to be present in wastewater received by the WWTP (Ross 2020). As such, the Surface Water Strategy will investigate a subset of this source category, which includes the direct discharges by the industrial facilities within the priority SIC codes id entified above; municipal WWTPs receiving pretreatment from industrial facilities; and, land application sites for industrial and municipal/domestic sludge (biosolids) associated with NPDES and ND permits. Also, on January 19, 2021, based on information collected and reported in Effluent Guidelines Plan 14 (USEPA 2021a), EPA announced the next steps the agency is taking to address PFAS in wastewater via NPDES permits issued by EPA: the publication of an Advanced Notice of Rulemaking whereby EPA intends to acquire data and information about PFAS manufacturers and the presence and treatment of PFAS in wastewater discharges from those manufacturers, the intent to request information regarding PFAS formulators (facilities that produce various products and materials from PFAS feedstocks), and interim strategy for PFAS in NPDES permits issued by EPA (USEPA 2021c). Ambient Surface Water Assessment Plan Assessment Design Rationale As stated above, the objective of the Surface Water Strategy is to answer the question : How widespread are PFAS in ambient surface waters and related aquatic media within the State of South Carolina? The results of this assessment, along with the Drinking Water Strategy findings, will provide valuable insights into the presence of PFAS in surface waters within the State and inform future DHEC actions related to addressing possible PFAS-related human health and ecological consequences. The total number of potential PFAS sources (current and former industrial sites, airports, military bases, landfills, WWTPs, and agricultural fields) to the State's surface waters is large and the spatial distribution of these sources is vast (Table 1). As such, it is not possible to sample surface waters near each potential source. 11 Table 1. Distributions of potential PFAS sources by category in each South Carolina major river basin. Counts include total number of sites associated with potential sources.

There may be multiple application fields associated with a permitted site. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) divides and sub-divides the United States into successively smaller hydrologic units which are classified into four levels: regions (2-digit), subregions (4-digit), accounting units (6-digit), and cataloging units (8-digit). Below these four primary levels are the watershed (10-digit) and sub-watershed (12-digit) levels. South Carolina comprises eight major basins: Broad, Catawba, Edisto, Pee Dee, Salkehatchie, Saluda, Santee, and Savannah (Figure 1). Within these eight major river basins are 38 8-digit cataloging units and 185 10-digit watershed units, each assigned a specific and identifying hydrologic unit code (HUC). 12 Figure 1. Major river basins in South Carolina. The 10-digit watershed classification level (HUC-10, Figure 2) represents an ideal spatial scale from which the BOW can identify priority study areas to characterize the environmental presence of PFAS from potential release sources (Table 1). The following sections summarize how HUC-10 level watersheds were identified and prioritized related to each potential PFAS source type listed in Table 1 while considering possible impacts in each of the eight major river basins in the State. The priority study areas for each source type were then aggregated to provide a final list of target watersheds. This approach ensures that PFAS distributions from all potential source types are investigated in each major river basin in targeted watersheds where these chemicals may occur. 13 Figure 2. HUC-10 level watersheds (purple) within each major river basin. There are 185 HUC-10 level watersheds in South Carolina. DOD and DOE facilities, Part 139 Airports, and South Carolina Fire Academy Each HUC-10 watershed that includes a DOD or DOE site, a Part 139 airport, or the South Carolina Fire Academy is identified as a priority study area. The DOD or DOE sites occur in parts of 14 HUC-10 watersheds across seven of the eight major river basins in the State (Broad River Basin excepted). There is considerable overlap in watersheds particularly east of Columbia at the confluence of the Saluda, Catawba, and Pee Dee basins among Fort Jackson, McEntire Joint National Guard Base, Shaw Air Force Base, and Poinsett Electronic Bombing Range. Further, Joint Base Charleston Air, Joint Base Charleston Weapons, and Charleston Naval Complex occur in two HUC-10 watersheds near Charleston (Figure 4 in Appendix A). The eight Part 139 airports occur in eleven different HUC-10 watersheds across six major river basins (Catawba and Edisto basins excepted), however, there is overlap between the airports and the military facilities. Together, airports and DOD/DOE facilities occur in 21 watersheds with overlap between 14 Charleston International and the Charleston area DOD sites and between Myrtle Beach International and former Myrtle Beach Air Force Base (Figure 4 in Appendix A). The South Carolina Fire Academy occurs in a Broad River Basin HUC-10 on the northside of Columbia. In total, the 12 DOD or DOE sites, eight Part 139 airports, and the South Carolina Fire Academy include 22 different HUC-10 watersheds (Figure 4 in Appendix A). Landfills For the PFAS source categories with large numbers of potential release sites ( i.e., landfills, industrial sites, and sludge land application sites), the top two watersheds by site count for each source type in each major river basin were identified as target study areas. The top two HUC-10 watersheds by landfill count in each river basin contain approximately 32% (213) of total active and inactive landfills throughout the State. The top two watersheds in each river basin average approximately 13 landfills per watershed with a range of 8.5 (Catawba) to 18 (Santee) (Figure 5 in Appendix A). Industrial Sites As stated above, this Surface Water Strategy considered approximately 300 past and current permitted industrial sources as possible contributors to PFAS in the environment. These industrial discharge sources include OCPSF, textiles, pulp and paper, landfills, federal facilities, fire protection, and other. There are approximately 500 individual outfalls associated with these past and current permits. The outfalls are treated as individual sites to capture the magnitudes associated with the facilities. The top two HUC-10 watersheds by outfall count in each river basin are selected as target study areas. These watersheds make up nearly 47% of the total count of industrial outfalls. The top two watersheds average 21-22.5 outfalls per watershed in the Broad, Santee, and Savannah basins. The Edisto and Salkehatchie basins have the lowest averages at 4 and 6 outfalls, respectively (Figure 6 in Appendix A). The former Galey and Lord textile mill in Society Hill, SC (Pee Dee River Basin), is not considered as part of this Strategy as this facility is under federal Superfund (EPA) and state (Bureau of Land and Waste Management) authority. Pretreatment POTWs In total, there are 76 potential municipal pretreatment POTW sources (72 active NPDES facilities, one closed facility, and three ND facilities). There are 96 sites associated with these 76 sources. Each NPDES permitted outfall and ND permitted wastewater irrigation field or lagoon is identified as a site. The Pee Dee Basin includes the highest number of sites (27) and the Edisto Basin contains the fewest (2) (Figure 7 in Appendix A). As there are fewer pretreatment municipal POTWs than the other large number source categories, the top watershed by site count in each major river basin was identified as a priority study area. These watersheds include approximately 28% of the total number of pretreatment POTW sites. Sludge Land Application Sites The top two sludge land applications watersheds in each basin are selected as target study areas. These watersheds represent 43% (980) of the total sites throughout the State. These watersheds average approximately 61 sludge land sites though the range is large. The lowest average number of sites in the top two watersheds occur in the Santee Basin (4); the Catawba Basin has the highest average number of sites (174) (Figure 8 in Appendix A). 15 Summary In total, 48 HUC-10 level watersheds were identified as target areas to address the primary objective of the Surface Water Strategy (Figure 3). The final number of watersheds indicates that there is considerable overlap among the potential PFAS source categories. A complete list of the target HUC-10 watersheds is presented in Appendix B. A specific sampling plan will be developed for each of these watersheds based on the number of potential PFAS sources and types present, source relationships to the river and stream network, size (class) of the waterways, and feasibility and accessibility of target areas. Based on these considerations, specific media (surface water and finfish/shellfish) for testing will be determined. Sample maps highlighting select watersheds, within watershed stream network, and potential PFAS sources are presented in Appendix C. Figure 3. HUC-10 level watersheds identified as key to addressing the Surface Water Strategy's primary objective. The watersheds are distributed across each of the major river basins in SC. PFAS of Interest Until EPA promulgates a 40 CFR Part 136 method, a suite of target 25 PFAS or precursor compounds known to occur or possibly occur in surface water and related media has been identified for use in the Surface 16 Water Strategy (Table 2). This suite represents PFAS across the spectrum including both short-chain and long-chain PFAA with carboxylate and sulfonate head groups. The list also includes precursor compounds that are known to occur or may possibly occur in environmental media. The proposed EPA SW-846 Method 8327 includes 17 of the 25 target compounds. A final list of test compounds will be determined as part of study plan development and will depend on analytical capacity of the selected contract laboratory and available funding resources. Table 2. Target list of PFAS and precursor compounds known to occur in environmental media. Compound Name Acronym Surface Water include mollusks ( e.g., oysters, clams) and crustaceans ( e.g., blue crabs, shrimp) 1: Identified in surface water (WA Dept. of Ecology 2017) 2: Identified in freshwater fish (WA Dept. of Ecology 2017) 3: Identified in estuarine or marine fish (Fair et al. 2019) 4: Identified in freshwater aquatic invertebrates (Koch et al. 2019) 5: Identified in blue crabs or other marine invertebrates (Yoo et al. 2009) 17 Media Three media have been identified as key to addressing the Surface Water Strategy's objective: surface water, finfish, and shellfish. These media have been selected to provide insights into the relationship between the water column and ecologically and economically important species on a PFAS specific basis. Testing for a subset of PFAS in fish and shellfish communities will establish a basic, first order, mechanistic link between PFAS in the water column and the resident aquatic faunal community. Quantifying these distributions will inform the BOW on partitioning tendencies between the water column and food webs for each PFAS compound and how each of these chemicals' properties influence how they interact with the South Carolina environment. This understanding will be enhanced by further resolving water chemistry (discussed below). This relationship is not meant to fully resolve trophic transfer or bioaccumulative tendencies of PFAS but to provide the BOW a sound basis from which to investigate questions related to human health consequences or ecological integrity. Other Supporting Aquatic Chemistry The primary objective of this study is to determine how widespread PFAS are in the surface water and related media (aquatic life). Water chemistry influences PFAS exposure and uptake by animal and plant life. To provide insights on exposure pathways between surface water and aquatic life, dissolved organic carbon, total organic carbon, hardness, alkalinity, water temperature, and pH will be determined in water samples collected at the same time as PFAS sampling. This PFAS site-specific stream data will bolster the State's historical ambient monitoring program data and provide a basis for understanding bioaccumulation tendencies which bear on human health and ecological integrity. Timeline Stream flows, hydrology, and geochemical conditions ( e.g., water temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH) in South Carolina exhibit seasonal trends and are related to prevailing climate and seasonal weather patterns. In general, winter conditions tend to result in higher rainfall totals, increased stream flows, lower water temperatures, and higher dissolved oxygen levels, while summer weather tends to be drier and warmer which yields reduced stream flows, warmer water temperatures, and lower dissolved oxygen levels. These seasonal differences in weather impact stream flushing, stream metabolic rates and assimilation capacity of organic matter, and stream chemistry. As such, each target watershed will be sampled at least once between November and February to characterize PFAS distributions and supporting chemistry during winter conditions and at least once between March and October to characterize the summer conditions. The total number of sampling events in each watershed will be determined based on funding availability and preliminary laboratory results. Field Sampling and Laboratory Analyses All field sampling will be conducted following approved DHEC field sampling methods or prevailing best practices that will be memorialized in an approved Quality Assurance Project Plan. Biological tissue (finfish, mollusks, and crustaceans) analyses will follow USFDA Method C-010.01 or other equivalent and appropriate method. Path Forward and Next Steps Adaptability and Implementation Schedule The BOW intends that the Surface Water Strategy outlined here represents a framework from which to develop a specific sampling plan. Ultimately, the sampling plan will be guided by watershed feasibility 18 analyses, which includes an understanding of the relationships between potential PFAS sources and local stream networks. The local stream network will inform which types of media will be investigated ( e.g., stream size, freshwater vs. marine/estuary settings). The total number of sampling sites will be determined from watershed feasibility studies and anticipated availability of resources. The BOW reserves the right to alter the Surface Water Strategy as new information or updated guidance becomes available. The BOW's Surface Water Strategy will be implemented along the following timeline: Second Quarter (April-June) 2021 Finalize and publish this Strategy Prepare quality assurance project plan Prepare procurement for external laboratory services Third Quarter (July-September) 2021 Finalize quality assurance project plan Award procurement for external laboratory services Fourth Quarter (October-December) 2021 Prepare for winter sampling program component First Quarter (January-March) 2022 Conduct winter sampling program component Update DHEC website with laboratory and field results Prepare for summer sampling program component Second Quarter (April-June) 2022 Conduct summer sampling program component Update DHEC website with laboratory and field results Third Quarter (July-September) 2022 Continue summer sampling program component Update DHEC website with laboratory and field results Fourth Quarter (October-December) 2022 Finalize 2022 field sampling Update DHEC website with remaining data First Quarter (January-March) 2023 Prepare study final report and update website 19 Communications The BOW commits that the results of the Surface Water Strategy will be communicated in a timely, consistent, and transparent manner. Throughout the implementation of this Strategy, BOW will communicate with the public through a Surface Water PFAS Strategy webpage that will be developed and maintained on the BOW webpage. This communication process will include regular updates on sample results. A final report and/or summary of findings will be posted on the webpage following conclusion of the field program and sample analyses. PFAS are currently not regulated contaminants. As such, DHEC's role at this time is to make the public aware of the data obtained as part of this Strategy and to provide information and education about PFAS compounds in the aquatic environment. 20 References Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. 2018.

Production of these compounds began in the 1940s. The chemical properties of PFAS give them the unique ability to repel both oil and water and as su ch have been widely used in commercial products. Commercial uses for PFAS include coatings for nonstick cookware, food packaging, stain -resistant fabrics, water -resistant clothing, and metal plating. PFAS are also used in firefighting foams (aqueous film f orming foam, AFFF), cosmetics, and industrial surfactants. PFAS compounds are highly persistent in the environment and resist degradation. Hence, PFAS chemicals are commonly referred to as forever chemicals . Among the documented sources of PFAS to the envi ronment, four are considered primary sources: fire training/response sites (military bases, civilian airports), industrial sites, landfills, and wastewater treatment plants. PFAS are ubiquitous in the environment due to their long- standing use in consumer , commercial, and industrial products and applications. Because the compounds are stable and mobile, they can be present in most environmental media including air, soil and sediment, groundwater, surface water, and biota (plants and animals). However, the distributions and concentrations of PFAS in environmental media are dependent on proximity to a potential source of release, nature of the source, and local geology, hydrology, and water chemistry. The objective of this study is to answer the question: How widespread are PFAS in ambient surface waters and related aquatic media within the State of South Carolina? The prevalence of PFAS in the environment in South Carolina is largely unknown, including in surface water and associated biota. The Surface Water PFAS Strategy identified a series of 48 priority Hydrologic Unit Code - 10 (HUC -10) level watersheds distributed across each major river basin within the State based on past and present sources that may have released or may release PFAS to the environment. Those sources include current and former industrial sites, airports, military bases, landfills, WWTPs, and agricultural fields used for land application of biosolids. The watersheds were selected by major river basin to ensure adequate representation throughout the State. To address the objective, DHEC will test for PFAS in a variety of media at 141 locations throughout the state. Media include surface water, freshwater fin fish, and oysters and blue crabs along the coast. Activities at each site vary, bu t of the 141 sites, PFAS will be analyzed in surface water at 106 sites on a quarterly basis. Field work will begin in July 2022 and end in June 2023. Of the 106 surface water PFAS sites, 6 5 are active ambient monitoring base sites and 4 1 are new sites im plemented as part of this project or existing DHEC sites that are not currently active. The project is divided into quarterly components (Q3 2022, Q4 2022, Q1 2023, and Q2 2023) for surface water sampling. Sampling Plan Overview As part of the routine sampling of these 65 base sites, a single PFAS surface water sample will be collected on an approximately quarterly schedule by regional sampling teams following protocols described below. Central office staff will be responsible for the 4 1 additio nal surface water sites. Pre-Sampling Considerations PFAS are present in a wide variety of sampling materials and field supplies such as waterproof pens and paper, personal protective equipment (PPE), clothing, food packaging, personal care products. As such, PFAS contamination of the surface water sample is an overarching concern of this project. PFAS are used to coat a variety of clothing and PPE to repel water, oil, and dirt. While preparing for sampling, pay attention to clothing or PPE that is advertised to have waterproof, water -repellant, or dirt and/ or stain resistant characteristics because these types of clothing may have had PFAS used in their manufacturing and can be a source of contamination. California provides the following examples of acceptable and prohibited sampling materials: *Note: This table is from the State of California. It's not always possible to wash hands in the field. Please be mindful of what you touch while wearing nitrile gloves. If you feel they may be contaminated, please change them. Also please be mindful of food wrappers so, if possible, please conduct PFAS sampling before eating a granola bar, bag of chips, etc. The South Carolina summer can be a harsh environment for us field samplers. Ultraviolet radiation from the sun, mosquitos, and ticks are an ever -present risk. T herefore, complete elimination of sunscreens and insect repellants that are known to contain PFAS may not be possible. Many personal care products, including cosmetics, moisturizers, fragrances, and creams may contain PFAS or may become contaminated with P FAS from the containers they are supplied in. For this reason, the use of such products should be avoided or minimized on the day of sampling. The words \"natural\" and/or \"organic\" in a product name or used to describe the product does not mean that the pro duct is PFAS -free. The State of Michigan has determined several sunscreens and insect repellents to be free of PFAS. We will be providing each region sunscreen and insect/mosquito repellent from this list. Please use these on days when PFAS sampling is to occur. PFAS are known to be prevalent in food packaging, including paper plates, aluminum foil, paper towels, food containers, bags, and wraps. Although long- chain PFAS have been banned for use in the manufacturing of cont act food materials in the United States, short -chain PFAS have not been banned. Therefore, these products could be sources of PFAS contamination. Please be mindful on PFAS sampling days. Sampl ing Equipment Preparation Each region will be provided two sampling rigs composed exclusively of stainless steel or PVC for PFAS surface water sampling only . The bridge sampling rig consists of a 6 0-foot stainless steel chain outfitted with a 1 .2 L stainless steel container. The shore /boat sampling rig includes an exte ndable PVC pole (up to 8 feet : 5 ft with a 3 ft extension ) equipped with an identical 1.2 L stainless steel container. Prior to daily use and after daily use please clean the stainless steel sampling containers with the Liquinox provided . Rinse containers with deionized water and perform a final rinse with laboratory supplied PFAS - free deionized water. We will provide PFAS -free deionized water to each region. PFAS- free deionized water will also be use d for field blanks described below. Let Matt Baumann kno w if you are running low and need more rinse/blank water. Please be conservative in your PFAS -free deionized water use. Sampling Guidance General Guidance Rain/Weather : If rain is expected or a certainty on a day with scheduled PFAS sampling, please postpone PFAS sampling. Reschedule PFAS sampling for that site(s) for the following month's regular run. This field program is on a quarterly sampling schedule so there is scheduling flexibility built into the program. Please notify Matt Baumann (baumanms@dhec.sc.gov ) and Caitlin Smith ( smithc5@dhec.sc.gov ) of adjustments . Apparel: On a field day where PFAS samples are to be collected, please wear well laundered clothes (i.e., clothes that have been washed a number of times) pref erably of cotton or jean material. Athletic apparel, or moisture wicking/repelling clothes are more likely to contain PFAS. Please refrain from using Gore -tex or similar material on PFAS sampling days. Additional guidance is provided in the table above. Multiple Sites in the Same Day: If multiple PFAS samples are to be collected on the same day or sampling run, lightly rinse the 1.2 L stainless steel sample container with PFAS -free deionized water after a sample is collected. Store the stainless steel sampl ing container in a gallon sized Ziploc bag for transit . At the next site, rinse the stainless steel container twice with sample water prior to collecting the sample to be transferred to the sample bottles. Sample Bottles: GEL Laboratories requests 2 x 250 mL bottles per sample and 1 x 15 mL screening vial . Carefully fill each 250 mL laboratory provided sample bottle and the screening vial with sample water. Please wear nitrile gloves and discard after use. GEL does not require preservative for surface water PFAS samples, but please be careful not to overflow the bottles. We will provide sample bottles to the regions in 'kits', which will c onsist of two sample bottles in a gallon sized Ziploc bag. If you need more consumables, please contact Matt or Caitlin . Stream Sampling Stream sampling may be conducted by one field sampler. Please collect the PFAS sample before any other sampling activit y is conducted at the site. Treat the PFAS sample as a 'separate' sampling event at that site. This will minimize contamination. General procedure: 1. At the site, wearing nitrile gloves label the sample bottle s with a regular ballpoint pen. In field tests on these labels, thin Sharpies did not dry and ran too quickly. Place sample bottles back in Ziploc bag. Discard gloves. 2. If sampling from a bridge : a. Wearing clean nitrile gloves carry the chain and bridge stainless steel bucket to the sampling location. Remo ve each from the respective bags and clip together. These have been built with quick release clips for easy assembly. Rinse the sample bucket twice with surface water. Collect the sample and return to the truck. Note: The buckets tip and fill easily in the stream. Please try to minimize chain contact with the stream. Lightly rinse chain with PFAS -free deionized water if necessary. b. Carefully fill the 250 mL sample bottles and screening vial. Immediately replace the caps and return to the Ziploc bag. Store o n ice in the PFAS cooler(s) provided. c. After collection, lightly rinse the stainless steel sampling container with PFAS -free deionize water and return it to the Ziploc bag for transport. 3. If sampling from a streambank, do not immediately put on new nitrile gloves after labeling sample bottles. a. Carry to the sampling location the PVC pole, streambank stainless steel bucket in its Ziploc bag, two sample bottles in a single Ziploc bag , and nitrile gloves in a separate Ziploc bag (this bag can be reused unless the sample r feels it's contaminated) . b. At the stream site sampling location, put on new nitrile gloves and assemble the pole sampling rig. Rinse the sampling stainless steel sampling bucket twice before collecting the sample to be transferred to th e sample bottles. c. Carefully fill the sample bottles at the point of collection and immediately replace the caps. Put sample bottles back in the Ziploc bag. d. At the truck, place Ziploc bag containing the two sample bottles on ice in the PFAS cooler(s) pro vided. e. After collection, lightly rinse the stainless steel sampling container with PFAS -free deionize water and return it to the Ziploc bag for transport. Boat Sampling 1. Boat sampling procedures are similar to stream sampling. Please treat the PFAS sample as its own sampling event at the site. However, there is no need to return to the landing/boat ramp immediately after the sample. Continue on with your regularly scheduled activities following collection of PFAS sample(s). 2. Once on site , wearing nitrile glo ves label the sample bottles with a ballpoint pen. Discard gloves. 3. Since there will be at least two samplers on the boat, team up to collect the sample. a. Sampler 1: Replace gloves, assemble the boat sampling rig (same as the streambank rig), rinse the stai nless steel container twice, and collect the sample. b. Sampler 2: Wearing clean nitrile gloves, open the sample bottles, and allow Sampler 1 to pour the sample from the stainless steel sampling container to the sample bottles. Once filled, immediately replace caps, place the sample bottles back in the Ziploc bag, and store on ice in the provided PFAS coolers. c. After collection, lightly rinse the stainless steel sampling container with PFAS -free deionize water and return it to the Ziploc bag for transport. As always, please follow standard best practices for environmental sampling to prevent contamination. A couple specific notes: Please collect the PFAS sample b efore any other sampling is conducted at the site. Label the sample bottle in the staging area using a ballpoint pen prior to sampling. Discard gloves after labeling . Always use the stainless steel sampling container to collect the surface water sample. Do not directly fill sample bottles by submerging in the stream or lake. Return the sample bottles to the Ziploc bag and store on ice. Samples must be kept at or below 4\u00b0C but not frozen. The sample container must be kept sealed and only opened during sample collection. The sampling container cap or lid should never be placed on the ground or on any other surface unless it is PFAS -free. When collecting and handling water samples, do not insert or let tubing or any materials inside the sample bottle. Dus t and fibers must be kept out of sample bottles. Chain of custody guidance is provided below. Field Blanks Each region will prepare two field reagent blanks (FRB) per quarter. A field reagent blank is an aliquot of PFAS -free deionized water transferred to an empty sample bottle in the field. If the region's sampling plan for the quarter involves collecting PFAS samples on multiple days, please prepare a field blank as part of sampling the first PFAS station on each of the first two days of sampling within the quarter . If all PFAS samples for the quarter are to be collected on the same day, please prepare a field blank as part of sampling the first two PFAS s ites of the day. To prepare a field reagent blank : 1. Once on site, wearing nitrile gloves label the sample bottles with a ballpoint pen as you would for a regular stream site . Place sample bottles back in Ziploc bag. Discard gloves. 2. Wearing new nitrile gloves, dispense PFAS -free deionized water into two 250 mL sample bottle s (same bottle quantity and volume as regular samples) . Immediately replace caps and put sample bottles back in the Ziploc bag. There is no screening vial associated with field blanks. 3. Store on ice in the PFAS cooler(s) provided. The blan k will be sent along to the laboratory and treated as if it were a regular PFAS surface water sample. PFAS- free deionized water will be provided with the sample kits. Chain of custody guidance is provided below. Additional Guidance Additional considerations when labelling samples and documenting field activities to prevent contamination : Regular/thick size markers (Sharpie or otherwise) should be avoided as they may contain PFAS. Please use b allpoint pens when labeling sample containers. Thin Sharpies were not successful in labeling bottles in the field. Ballpoint pens will be provided to each region. Do not use sticky notes, plastic clipboards, or waterproof paper and notebooks in the sampling area. 'Rite in the Rain ' notebooks /paper are acceptable to use in the staging area provided gloves are changed after note taking. Chain of Custody and Shipping Please fill out a chain of custody for each set of samples sent to the central office (an example COC is included below) : 'Client Name ' is SC DHEC. 'Project/Site Name ' is Surface Water PFAS Project. 'Send results to ' is M. Baumann. Please fill out 'Collected By' with the sampler's name. For 'Sample ID' list station and note 'surface water '. For example, 'B- 040'. Please fill in date and time collected in the format indicated on the COC . o For regular samples the QC code is ' N' for normal sample. Field filtered is ' N' because samples are not field filtered. Sample matrix is ' SW' for surface water. Samples are not radioactive or hazardous. For field reagent blanks: Sample ID format is 'Region - Sampling Quarter - Blank Number '. The surface water component is broken down into four quarters: Q3 and Q4 of 2022 and Q1 and Q2 of 2023. The quarter numbers are sequential f or identification purposes: Q1 of 2023, and Q4 is Q2 of 2023. o For example, the first Greenville region FRB this summer will be identified as: 'Greenville FRB Q1.1' Please fill in date and time collected in the format indicated on the COC. The second and final Greenville first quarter field blank will be 'Greenville FRB Q1.2'. o For field blanks samples the QC code is ' FB' for field blank. Field filtered is ' N' because samples are not field filtered. Sample matrix is ' SW' for surface water. Samples are not radioactive or hazardous. Total number of containers will be ' 2' as we're collecting 2 x 250 mL bottles per sample. The screening vial does not count toward s the total. Surface water samples will be identified in the Sample Analysis Requested as 'PFAS' . GEL is providing us approx. two coolers per region that will be couriered back and forth. Please use these coolers bo th in the field and for shipping samples to the central office. Once we receive samples, the cooler will be sent back to the region. Surface water samples have a 14 -day hold time if they are kept at 4 \u00b0C (40 \u00b0F). Before sending samples to the central office, please sign and date the COC, place COC in provided plastic bag, and tape it to the inside of the cooler lid. Ensure there is enough ice to last through the following morning. Tape the cooler shut. Send samples via courier to: Matthew Baumann EA - Bureau of Water 2600 Bull St. Columbia, SC 29201 Please notify Matt Smith ( smithc5@dhec.sc.gov ) when a shipment is on the way.
