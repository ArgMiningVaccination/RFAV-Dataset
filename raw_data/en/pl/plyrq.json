The study, known as Project PREVENT (PReventing Emerging Infections through Vaccine EffectiveNess Testing), is designed to measure the comparative effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine(s) by looking at how well the vaccine works, return-to-work practices, and how receptive people are to receiving the vaccine. The test-negative case control study will enroll up to 10,000 health care workers who are tested for COVID-19 over a 6- to 12-month period beginning this winter. COVID-19 infected participants will be matched in a 3:1 ratio with symptomatic non-COVID-19 controls, according to Nick Mohr, MD, MS, UI professor of emergency medicine, anesthesia critical care, and epidemiology, and co-principal investigator for the study. \"When vaccines are approved, we are going to enter an important 'next phase' of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Mohr says. \"Health care personnel will be among the first to receive COVID-19 vaccinations, and studying their experiences will give us insights into how we can protect both health care workers and the general public once a vaccine is more widely available.\" The UI also will be the data coordinating center for this project.
