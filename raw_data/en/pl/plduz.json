We seek to protect anglers and their families by uncovering unknown contamination threats to Minnesota fish. Funds Requested: $276,000 Proposed Project Completion: June 30 2025 LCCMR Funding Category: Water Resources (B) Project Location What is the best scale for describing where your work will take place? Statewide What is the best scale to describe the area impacted by your work? Statewide When will the work impact occur? During the Project and In the Future 4/7/2021 2 Narrative Describe the op portunity or problem your proposal seeks to address. Include any relevant background information. Recent reports of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in rainbow smelt have troubled Minnesota's anglers and their families. PFAS are widely present in consumer products, and they don't break down once they enter the environment. Instead, they can accumulate in fish and end up on our dinner tables. The implications span generations: PFAS have been linked with developmental health effects in children, and may compr omise immune activity and impact COVID -19 vaccine efficacy in adults. As Minnesota seeks to lead the nation to reduce PFAS contamination, innumerable other contaminants are present in the environment - and we may not even realize they exist. For example, 6P PD-quinone, a mysterious chemical that caused mass Coho salmon deaths on the West Coast, eluded detection because it's not directly produced by humans. Rather, it's a \"transformation product\" formed from tire rubber left on road surfaces. Further, the Minn esota Department of Agriculture recently reported detection of cyanazine transformation products in Minnesota waterbodies. Cyanazine is an herbicide no longer used in the US, and its transformation products were likely missed by monitoring programs for years. Therefore, as Minnesota seeks to reduce known contamination, we also have the opportunity to \"catch and reveal\" unknown fish contamination threats. What is your proposed solution to the problem or opportunity discussed above? i.e. What are you seeking funding to do? You will be asked to expand on this in Activities and Milestones. To protect Minnesota's families and fisheries, water quality monitoring efforts must cast a wide net to both track down sources of known contaminants and uncover potentially h azardous unknown contaminants. We seek to identify chemical fingerprints across waterbodies impacted by different land uses that indicate potential threats to Minnesota's fisheries. We will go beyond current and planned monitoring efforts by coupling innov ative field techniques with state- of-the-art chemical analysis methods. Specifically, we will use passive samplers (small vessels that take up contaminants over time when submerged in water) to capture contaminants that are likely to accumulate in fish while avoiding time - consuming and costly efforts to measure contaminants in fish tissue directly. Passive samplers will be deployed at sites across MN representative of waterbodies impacted by urban, industrial, and agricultural activities, as well as pristin e waterbodies representing reference conditions. Contaminants collected on samplers will be measured using novel discovery -based chemical analysis techniques, enabling simultaneous measurement of known contaminants while acquiring a \"snapshot\" of all conta minants present in a sample - known or unknown. Finally, identified contaminants will be ranked according to potential threats to aquatic life by using databases and risk assessment tools to compile known or predicted bioaccumulation and toxicity potential. What are the specific project outcomes as they relate to the public purpose of protection, conservation, preservation, and enhancement of the state's natural resources? Our findings will provide a knowledge base for more comprehensive statewide contamina nt monitoring and mitigation plans. Specifically, we will take a nontargeted approach to broadly observe contaminants lurking in MN waterbodies, in complement to conventional monitoring activities. Further, by ranking identified contaminants according to k nown or estimated hazards, our results will inform the prioritization of new contaminants to be included in existing monitoring and mitigation programs. These efforts will protect Minnesota's natural resources and lead to cleaner water and healthier fisheries. Moreover, protecting Minnesota's fisheries also means protecting our families, freshwater recreational opportunities, regional economies, and cultural identity. 4/7/2021 3 Activities and Milestones Activity 1: Development of passive sampling methods and field monitoring plans Activity Budget: $87,300 Activity Description: Preliminary work will be required to develop data collection methods that are comparable across varying field conditions, as described below: Task 1a: Development of passive sampling m ethods. Several types of commercially available passive samplers with varying modes of contaminant capture will be evaluated in laboratory experiments under a range of flow conditions with realistic natural waters. The sampler (or combination of samplers) that most comprehensively captures contaminants will be selected for deployment. Sampler collection frequencies that optimize contaminant capture and time resolution will be determined according to experimental data. Task 1b: Development of deployment pla n. We will work with regional managers to select field sites along MN streams that represent the following categories of expected land -use impacts: pristine, urban -impacted, industry -impacted, and agriculture -impacted. We will target locations with active stream gauges, expect sites to be distributed throughout Northeastern MN, Southern MN, and the Twin Cities Metro area. We will also develop a sensor deployment plan to continuously monitor other parameters important to fish and fish habitat health (temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, and turbidity). The output of this activity will be a field monitoring plan to comprehensively collect water quality and contaminant data across Minnesota streams impacted by varying land uses. Activity Milestones : Description Completion Date Passive sampler and analysis methods verified in the laboratory February 28 2023 Field sites selected and sampling plan finalized February 28 2023 Sensors, samplers, and other field equipment acquired March 31 2023 Activity 2: Deployment and monitoring of passive samplers and sensors Activity Budget: $157,632 Activity Description: Passive samplers and in -stream, high -frequency sensors will be deployed and monitored over two field seasons as described below: Task 2a : Deployment and maintenance of monitoring equipment. Sensors and samplers will be securely installed within streams at easily accessible locations, allowing field crews to maintain sensors and download data approximately every other week from April - Octo ber. The frequency of sampler collection will be determined during Activity 1 to optimize contaminant capture and time resolution. To inform contaminant load calculations, we will also measure water height and measure discharge to create rating curves for each stream. Task 2b: Discovery -based analysis of captured contaminants. Contaminants extracted from samplers will be analyzed using discovery -based chemical analysis techniques, yielding \"snapshots\" of virtually all detectable compounds present. Briefly, candidate contaminant \"peaks\" will be deciphered from acquired data, and then established workflows will be 4/7/2021 4 performed to link observed mass spectra (a chemical fingerprint) with potential contaminant identities. Confidence of identities will be ranked a ccording to established methods, and concentrations will be measured if analytical standards are readily available. The output of this activity will be a summary of measured water quality parameters and detected contaminants (known and newly identified) in streams across varying land uses. Activity Milestones: Description Completion Date Passive samplers and sensors deployed April 30 2023 Collection of samplers and sensor data completed November 30 2024 Measurement of known contaminants and identification of unknown contaminants completed March 31 2025 Activity 3: Assessment of potential fish contamination threats and dissemination of findings Activity Budget: $31,068 Activity Description: Task 3a: Compile a ranked list of potential fish c ontamination threats. The potential hazards of detected contaminants will be quantified according to known or predicted indicators of aquatic toxicity and bioaccumulation potential. Briefly, we will search the US EPA's ECOTOXicology Knowledgebase (ECOTOX) for toxicity data for detected contaminants, compile known aquatic toxicity indicators, and use data for structurally similar compounds to estimate indicators for cases where no toxicity data exists. Contaminant bioaccumulation potential (an indicator of t he likelihood of contaminants to accumulate in fish) will be estimated using standardized software (e.g., EPA's Epi Suite). A weighted ranking system will be applied to create a prioritized list of detected contaminants according to aquatic toxicity and bioaccumulation potential, and trends in hazard potential and land -use impacts will be evaluated. The list will also be cross -checked with contaminant lists from current monitoring programs to identify potentially problematic gaps. Task 3b: Disseminate fin dings. Our results and recommendations for expanded contaminant monitoring programs will be summarized in a final report. Findings will be disseminated to resource managers, stakeholders, and the public through state and regional agency presentations, comm unity gatherings, media stories, NRRI and UMD communications, conference presentations, and peer -reviewed scientific articles.

Yes Long -Term Implementation and Funding Describe how the results will be implemented and how any ongoing effort will be funded. If not already addressed as part of the project, how will findings, results, and products developed be implemented after project completion? If additional work is needed, how will this be funded? In reflection of NRRI's commitment to sustaining Minnesota's natural resources, we will continue to disseminate our findings and advise resource managers beyond the project duration. This will lead to future implementation of evidence - based, statewide contaminant monitoring programs that more effectively target potential threats to fisheries and families alike. Development of discovery -based chemical analysis methods are ongoing at NRRI, and are funded as a part of the US EPA's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI). Beyond project completion, we intend to seek funding opportunities for solutions -oriented research to mitigate contamination threats uncovered as a part of our findings.
