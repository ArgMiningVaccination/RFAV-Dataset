At Evolve Naturopathic Vitality Centre, we offer a four pronged approach to graceful aging with our unique Nature Inspired Facial Rejuvenation Cosmetic Acupuncture series.

Our therapies increase circulation, tissue oxygenation and nutrition to support and enhance connective tissue integrity, and cellular health from inside and out. A Non-Surgical Facelift Cosmetic acupuncture is a growing specialty within the practice of acupuncture that requires additional training and certification above and beyond traditional acupuncture practices. It is a highly effective and non-toxic treatment, using the principles of Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine for patients who want to improve their appearance without the use of chemicals, fillers, injections or surgery. It is a much safer alternative to injections and surgery and requires no recovery time. This form of non-surgical facelift uses acupuncture and natural therapeutics to balance and remove blockages in the meridians to enhance the flow of \"qi\" and blood to effectively slow and diminish the signs of aging. Facial needles are tiny and thin, thus minimizing discomfort. Cosmetic acupuncture involves the combined use of traditional body acupuncture points to help regulate underlying physiological changes and superficial facial points to address localized issues. The result, an increase in local circulation and stimulation of internal collagen production to naturally fill in fine lines and wrinkles, enhance tissue tone and reveal a healthy, glowing complexion and an overall sense of well-being and self-confidence.
