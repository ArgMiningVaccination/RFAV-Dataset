However, due to the heterogenous definition of CAM, which can encompass natural products, mind-body practices, or complementary approaches such as traditional Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, and homeopathy, the interpretation and evaluation of the literature has been difficult. Investigators in Germany conducted a [substudy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10180689/ ) analysis of a large, multicenter, epidemiological, cross-sectional [study](https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/JCO.2014.56.0086?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed ). This substudy involved 1,214 female patients with either breast cancer (BC) or gynecological cancer to examine the prevalence of CAM use, whether CAM was found helpful, the types of CAM utilized, the sociodemographic factors and medical variables associated with CAM use, and the relationship between CAM use and quality of life (QoL) in this population. The study was conducted in oncological inpatient clinics at acute-care hospitals, specialized outpatient cancer care facilities, and cancer rehabilitation centers in Germany. Patients were aged between 18 to 75 years and had a malignant tumor. Those aged younger than 18 years or aged older than 75 years, those with severe cognitive or physical impairment, and those with language barriers were excluded. The study participants were queried as to the type of CAM that they utilized (e.g., anthroposophical medicine [i.e., study of the evolution of human wisdom as it relates to illness and healing], [Bach-flowers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2695424/#:~:text=It%20contains%20a%20mixture%20of,and%20clematis%20(Clematis%20vitalba) ) (which contain a mixture of star umbellatum], rock traditional Chinese medicine/acupuncture, others). QoL was evaluated using the cancer-specific EORTC-QLQ-C30 (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire Core 30). Distress was assessed using the Distress Thermometer. Of the 5,889 patients eligible to participate in the study from the main trial, 4,020 (68%) agreed to further study. However, 2,806 did not meet the study criteria (e.g., were men with BC or women with other cancer diagnoses). Therefore, this substudy included a total of 1,214 patients, of which almost three-quarters (897; 73.9%) had BC and 317 (26.1%) had gynecological cancers, which included cervical, endometrial, ovarian, fallopian tube, vulval, or vaginal cancers. Overall, 46.5% of the study patients had used CAM. The article focuses on findings among the BC population. Of the BC patients, whose mean age was 55.3 years, 48.6% used CAM (n = 436). Of the CAM users, 21.1% of BC patients used one type of CAM, 12.6% used two types of CAM, 5.8% used three types of CAM, 4.8% used four types of CAM, and 4.3% used more than four types of CAM. When rating the usefulness of CAM, 28.6% found that CAM was very much helpful, 32.2% reported that it was quite a bit helpful, whereas only 4.9% did not find CAM helpful at all. Among the most common types of CAM utilized were vitamins/minerals/micronutrients, which were consumed by 41.2% of BC CAM users. The next most popular type of CAM was homeopathy used by 20.5% of BC patients, followed by mistletoe therapy, which was used by 15.6% of BC patients. According the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), although [European mistletoe](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/european-mistletoe ) has been studied for cancer, its effects are not well understood because much of the research has been of poor quality. NCCIH warns that European mistletoe berries and leaves can cause serious harmful effects when taken orally and that it is probably unsafe during pregnancy. Injectable European mistletoe extract may cause soreness and inflammation at the injection site, headache, fever, chills, and severe allergic reactions. Other forms of CAM utilized by BC patients in decreasing frequency were enzymes (11.0%), Among the total study population (BC and gynecological cancers), CAM users were younger, more educated, had higher monthly incomes, had more advanced disease, and were more often distressed. Time since diagnosis was significantly longer in CAM users and more CAM users had received chemotherapy. QoL dimensions that were associated with improvement with CAM use in BC patients included pain and insomnia. CAM was of no benefit for fatigue, nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and global health status (QoL). With evidence pointing to an ever-increasing [CAM market](https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2022/06/13/2461116/28124/en/Global-Complementary-and-Alternative-Medicine-Market-2022-to-2027-Industry-Trends-Share-Size-Growth-Opportunity-and-Forecasts.html ), pharmacists need to be familiar with the types of products/therapies their BC patients are using. As many CAM products have the potential to interact with medications used in the management of cancer, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has developed an app called Herbs App. Information about the app can be found at [https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/diagnosis-treatment/symptom-management/integrative-medicine/herbs/about-herbs.](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/diagnosis-treatment/symptom-management/integrative-medicine/herbs/about-herbs) The content contained in this article is for informational purposes only.
