Passing the GED\u00ae test proves you have a high school-level education. If you pass, you will be awarded a GED\u00ae test credential, the equivalent of a high school diploma. Four separate tests make up the GED\u00ae test: 1.Mathematical Reasoning 2.Reasoning through Language Arts (RLA) 3.Social Studies 4.Science To score your best on each test, not only will you need to know the basics of each subject, but you'll also need to use critical thinking, writing, and problem-solving skills. If this sounds like a lot to handle, don't worry\u2014 this book is designed to help you overcome any test anxiety or fear you're experiencing, through careful and effective preparation alongside proven strategies for maximizing your test time and earning your best possible scores. How Is the Test Taken? You will take the GED\u00ae test on a computer. Although you absolutely do not need to be a computer expert to take the GED\u00ae test, you should be comfortable using a mouse and typing on a keyboard. Test Length You can choose to take all four GED\u00ae tests at once, or you can take each test separately. The entire exam will take about seven hours to complete. The timing for each subject area is as follows: n Mathematical Reasoning\u2014115 minutes n Reasoning through Language Arts\u2014150 minutes (including a 10-minute break) n Science\u201490 minutes n Social Studies\u201490 minutes When Can You Take the GED\u00ae Test? There are a variety of scheduling options for taking the GED\u00ae test, depending on your state and area. Please check with the ofcial GED\u00ae Testing Service\u00ae for scheduling options available to you: ged-test ing-service Where Can You Take the GED\u00ae Test? To nd a GED\u00ae testing center that's convenient for you, go online to the following link, choose your location, and enter your zip code: www.gedtestingservice.com/testers/ locate-a-test ing-center How Do You Sign Up for the Test? You can sign up for any or all of the GED\u00ae tests online at the ofcial GED\u00ae Testing Service website and get more information on options in your area. How Much Will the Test Cost? Each of the four GED\u00ae tests costs $30 to take, for a total of $120 for all four tests. You can pay for any or all parts of the test you are rea dy to take. There might also be additional fees, depending on which state you will take the test in. You may be eligible for a fee waiver to help cover the cost; you can contact the ofcial GED\u00ae Testing Ser - vice for available options for paying for the tests. How Are the Tests Scored? A minimum score of 150 is required to pass each test. Each question on the GED\u00ae test is assigned a different point value depending on its difculty. You will nd out your score or scores on the same day you take each test. 22 - - INTRODUCTION TO THE GED\u00ae TEST Question Types Most of the questions on the GED\u00ae test are multiple choice, where you pick the best answer out of four given choices: a, b, c, or d. Because you'll take the test on a computer, you'll also see some other kinds of questions, which will ask you to use your mouse to move images around, use the keyboard to type in your answer, and other types of interactivity. These other question types are called: n Drag and drop n Drop-down n Fill in the blank n Hot spot n Short answer and extended response If you have never used a computer or a mouse before, it may take some getting used to. The key is to prac-tice, practice, practice! Read on to get the informa-tion you need to be comfortable with how the GED\u00ae test w orks and what you'll need to do in order to make your way through the test. Here we review each questio n type carefully, so you'll know exactly what to expect on test day. Drag and Drop For these questions, you will need to click on the cor - rect object, hold down the mouse, and drag the object to the appropriate place in the problem, diagram, chart, or graph that you're given. Drag-and-drop questions have two areas; one area shows all of the possible answer choices, and the other area is where you will move the correct answer(s). You will need to drag one or more answers from the rst area to the second area. To answer a drag-and-drop question, you will click and hold the mouse on an answer and move it (drag it) to the correct area of the screen. Then let go of the mouse (drop it). You can remove an answer and switch it with another answer at any time. You'll see a question similar to this on the test scree n: Of course, within this book you can't drag and drop items. For the purposes of this book, you will choose from a list of items, as you would on a typical drag-and-drop question, and write the correct answer(s) in the appropriate spot. Drop-Down In drop-down questions, you will need to select the answer or phrase to complete a sentence or problem from a menu that drops down with the click of a button. Drop-down questions are very similar to multiple-choice questions. To answer the question, click your mouse on the arrow to show all of the answer choices. Then click on your chosen answer to complete the sentence, paragraph, or equation. 33 - - INTRODUCTION TO THE GED\u00ae TEST You'll see a question similar to this on the test screen: Fill in the Blank These questions ask you to manually type in answer(s) to a problem rather than selecting from several choices. The ll-in-the-blank questions in this book look almost exactly like the ones you'll encoun-ter in the online test, but here you will of course have to write in your answer instead of typing it. Hot Spot For hot-spot questions, you will be asked to click on an area of the screen to indicate where the correct answer is located. For instance, you may be asked to plot a point by clicking on the corresponding online graph or may be asked to click on a certain area of a map. To answer the question, click on the correct spot of the image provided. You can change your answer by simply clicking on another area. You'll see a question similar to this on the test scre en: 44 - - INTRODUCTION TO THE GED\u00ae TEST In this book, you may be asked to draw a dot on a specic point or to circle a certain part of a diagram to simulate practicing this type of question. Short Answer and Extended Response These types of questions are similar to ll-in-the-blank questions\u2014you must type your response in the provided text box. You should feel comfortable typ-ing on a keyboard in order to answer these questions, since there is a time limit for each test. Therefore, it is essential to practice before the day of the test. n Short answer questions require you to write a paragraph instead of a word or two, usually in response to a passage or an image. These ques - tions can usually be answered with just a few sen-tences and will probably take about 10 minutes to co mplete. n Extended response questions require you to write an essay. You will be given 45 minutes to read one or two informational articles (a total of 550 to 650 words) and type an essay response (on the computer, using a simple word processing program) that contains evidence and examples. When using this book, you can choose to either hand-write your short answers and extended responses or ty pe them on a computer or typewriter. On test day, the text box you'll see on your scre en will look similar to this: Notice that at the top of the box you will nd tools to help you edit your answer if necessary. You can do the following: n Select your words: Before you can copy or cut words or sentences (explained next), you rst need to know how to highlight the exact text you want to work with. Highlight text by dragging your mouse across it while holding down the left mouse button. n Copy and paste: Copying and pasting allows you to repeat a word or words in another place in your essay. \u00b0 Step 1\u2014Highlight the words you want to copy, and then click the \"Copy\" option on the toolbar. 55 \u00b0 Step 2\u2014Next, click your mouse where you want to paste the words, and then click the \"Paste\" option. n Cut and paste: Cutting and pasting allows you to select a word or words from one place in your essay and move them to another place. \u00b0 Step 2\u2014Next, click your mouse where youwant to paste the words, and then click the \"Paste\" option. - - INTRODUCTION TO THE GED\u00ae TEST \u00b0 Step 1\u2014Highlight the words you want to cut, and then click the \"Cut\" option on the toolbar. n Undo and redo: If you've accidentally typed in wrong words, you can quickly and easily undo what you have entered. To undo an action, click the \"Undo\" option on the toolbar. 66 - - INTRODUCTION TO THE GED\u00ae TEST Maybe you've decided not to undo your original answer, and you want to go back to what you origi- nally wrote. This is when you redo an action. To reverse an undo action, click the \"Redo\" option on the toolbar. Getting comfortable with the Ged\u00ae test When you're ready to take the GED\u00ae test, you'll want to save all your energy for answering questions. You don't want to waste time being unsure of how to use the computer correctly. Use the following informa-tion to help you get prepared. Basic Clicking and Navigation When you take the GED\u00ae test, you'll see different buttons on each screen. You will need to know how to point and c lick these buttons to move through the different pages of the test, nd important information, and choose an answer. To point and click, move your mouse over the button, image, or text you want to choose and then click the left side of the mouse. (Your cursor will change to a hand when the mouse is over your selected item.) During the test, you will need to read a passage or look at a graph or other information in order to answer a question. The information or image and its question(s) will be on a screen page for you to read and answer. 77 INTRODUCTION TO THE GED\u00ae TEST - - 88 - - INTRODUCTION TO THE GED\u00ae TEST n Sometimes, all of the information will not com - plet ely show up on a screen because it is too long. You wil l need to use the mouse to scroll to see all of the information or a test question. You can use the scroll bar to move up or down a document to see the parts that do not show up in the main area of the screen. \u00b0 Vertical scroll bars will show up on the right side of the window if what you need to read is too long to t within the window. This lets you move it up and down. \u00b0 Horizontal scroll bars will show up across thebottom of the window if what you need to read is too wide to t within the window. This lets you move it left and right. To use the scroll bar, place the mouse pointer over the scroll bar. Hold down the mouse button and drag the scroll bar up or down, or right or left, without letting go of the button. Page Tabs Sometimes you will see page tabs at the top of a doc- ument you are asked to read. Each tab stands for a differ ent page that you must read to answer the ques- tions. You will need to click on each tab to see and read ea ch page in order to answer your questions. 99 - - INTRODUCTION TO THE GED\u00ae TEST Click and Drag Sometimes, you will have to move windows that appear on the computer screen in order to answer a question. You can move windows by clicking and dragging. To move a window, place the cursor over it, pr ess and hold down the left mouse button, and then move the mouse while still holding down the button. When you have dragged the object to the location you want, let go of the button. About the Ged\u00ae test s ections Before you make your way through the rest of the book, let's briefly explore each of the four GED\u00ae test sections. The more information you have before test day, the more condent and prepared you'll be for success! Mathematical Reasoning On the GED\u00ae Mathematical Reasoning test, you will have 115 minutes (just under two hours) to answer 45 questions. These questions will fall into two areas: quantitative problem solving and algebraic problem solv ing. n Quantitative problem solving questions cover basic math concepts like multiples, factors, expo - nents, absolute value, ratios, averages, and pr obability. n Algebraic problem solving questions cover basic topics in algebra, including linear equations, qua - dratic equations, functions, linear inequalities, and mor e. Calculator An online calculator, called the TI-30XS M ulti- View, will be available to you for most of the ques-tions within the Mathematical Reasoning section. You 'll also be able to bring your own TI-30XS Multi- View calculator to the exam for use during the test. Your rst ve questions will be non-calculator quest ions, but the rest of the test will have this on- screen calculator available for you to use. If you have never used the TI-30XS MultiView or another scien-tic calculator before, be sure to practice using it be fore you take the actual test. 1010 - - INTRODUCTION TO THE GED\u00ae TEST The GED\u00ae T esting Service has created a calculator reference sheet and tutorial videos on its website to help you practice. The reference sheet will also be available for you to use during the test. However, you should be comfortable with the functions of the calculator before taking the test. You will not want to take extra time to read through the directions while trying to complete the problems on test day. The reference sheet can be found at www.ged testingservice.com. Formulas A list of formulas will be available for you to use dur - ing the test. However, the list will not inc lude basic formulas such as the area of a rectangle or triangle, circumference of a circle, or perimeter of geometric gures. You will be expected to know these already. Review the Appendix at the end of the book to see the list of formulas you will be given on test day. Reasoning through Language Arts The GED\u00ae Reasoning through Language Arts (RLA) exam tests your reading, writing, and English-language skills. Questions in this section will ask you to do things like identify the main idea or theme in a reading passage or determine the meanings of words within a passage. The RLA section also tests your knowledge of grammar, sentence structure, and the mechanics of language. Sharpening your reading and writing skills is important for the GED\u00ae test, and not only for the RLA section; the GED\u00ae Social Studies test and the GED\u00ae Science test also measure your ability to understand and communicate ideas through writing. There are 48 questions and one extended respo nse question on the RLA test. You will have 150 minutes to complete the entire exam, with one 10-minute scheduled break. For most of the ques-tions on the RLA test, you will be given a reading pas-sage, followed by six to eight questions that test y our ab ility to understand and analyze what you have rea d. Dr op-down items are mostly used on the GED\u00ae RLA e xam to test grammar and English-language mechanics. Drop-down questions are inserted in the middle o f paragraphs. You will be asked to \"drop down\" a menu with several sentence choices and choose the one that ts best grammatically in the sentence. Passage Types for Reading Questions Of the reading passages on the RLA test, 25% will be liter ature. This includes historical and modern c- tion, as well as nonction like biographies or essays. You mig ht generally think of literature as ction (invented stories), but literary texts can also be non-ction (true stories). The other 75% of the reading passages w ill be from informational texts, including workplace documents (like memos or letters). These passages will often cover topics in social studies and science. The RLA test also features historical passages that are considered part of the \"Great American Con- versation.\" These include documents, essays, and spee ches that have helped shape American history. There are no poetry or drama passages on the RLA test. Extended Response Questions As you learned earlier in the chapter, the extended respo nse item requires you to nd and use informa- tion from the reading passage (or passages) to answer the quest ion in a well-thought-out essay. You will be asked to analyze an issue and likely also asked to pro-vide an opinion on what you have read. You will have 45 minu tes of your total RLA time to complete this essay\u2014that includes brainstorming, writing a draft, writing a nal version, and proofreading your work. Science The GED\u00ae Science test focuses on scientic reasoning and tests how well you understand and can apply science principles in real-world situations. It is made up of 35 questions, which you will have 90 minutes to complete. 1111 - - INTRODUCTION TO THE GED\u00ae TEST The test will include reading passages, graphs, and charts. The majority of the information you need to answer questions will be within the exam itself, whether in a diagram or in a passage. The test does not ask you to memorize science facts beforehand. The science topics covered on the GED\u00ae Science test ar e: n Physical science\u201440% of the questions n Life science\u201440% of the questions n Earth and space science\u201420% of the questions On the GED\u00ae Science test, physical science includes high school physics and chemistry and covers the structure of atoms, the structure of matter, the properties of matter, chemical reactions, conservation of mass and energy, increase in disorder, the laws of motion, forces, and the interactions of energy and matter. Life science deals with subjects covered in high scho ol biology classes, including cell structure, heredity, biological evolution, behavior, and interdependence of organisms. Earth and space questions will test your kn owledge of Earth and the solar system, the geochemical cycles, the origin and evolution of the Earth and the universe, and energy in the Earth system. Social Studies The GED\u00ae Social Studies test is made up of 35 questions and one extended response item. You will have 65 minutes to answer the questions and 25 minutes to write your essay. The questions on this test are based on information provided to you, such as brief texts, excerpts from speeches, maps, graphics, and tables. As on the GED\u00ae Science exam, the information you'll need to answer questions on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test will be contained in the passages, political cartoons, maps, and other information presented on the test. You do not have to memorize names, dates, places, and facts beforehand. As on the GED\u00ae RLA test, many of the brief te xts featured will be drawn from materials reflecting the \"Great American Conversation,\" which includes documents like the Declaration of Independence and other notable historical texts from U.S. history. The Social Studies exam focuses on four areas: 1. Civics and government\u201450% of the questions 2. United States history\u201420% of the questions 3. Economics\u201415% of the questions 4. Geography and the world\u201415% of the ques-tions summary Now that you're more familiar with the GED\u00ae test, we can begin reviewing each GED\u00ae test section in greater depth and tackle some helpful test practice. The practice questions in this book are designed to be as close as possible to the actual questions you'll see on test day. Each practice question in this book is accompanied by a very detailed answer explanation\u2014 so you'll be able to see not only why the correct answer is right but also why each of the other choices is incorrect. Use the information, review, and practice provided in this book to develop a solid study plan between now and test day. Best of luck on your GED\u00ae test study journey\u2014 and on y our test-taking experience! 1212 T R PA I GED\u00ae MAThEMATicAl REAsoninG TEsT This section of the GED\u00ae test review focuses on the GED\u00ae Mathematical Reasoning test. The purpose of the Mathematical Reasoning test is to assess your depth of math knowledge. In addition to being able to demonstrate your ability to perform computations correctly, this test assesses your ability to reason mathematically: to build solution pathways and to evaluate the lines of reasoning as you solve problems. In other words, are you able to identify how to start a problem? Can you change your course of action when your original solution pathway is not working? Can you recognize flaws in your reasoning or that of others? Do you understand what you are doing, or are you simply following a memorized procedure? Building your conceptual understanding of math will not only help you pass this test but will also aid you in furthering your education and in securing and maintaining future jobs. You will be given 115 minutes to complete the Mathematical Reasoning test. There will be 46 questions, but the scoring is done on a scaled basis, so that each question may be worth more than one point. You will need to get a scaled score of 150 to pass the Mathematical Reasoning module. 13To access online GED Test Mathematical Reasoning practice that provides instant scoring and feedback: Navigate to your LearningExpress platform and make sure you're logged in. Search for the following test and then click \"Start Test.\" GED Mathematical Reasoning Practice Test 1 - - GED MATHEMATICAL REASONING TEST Mathematical Reasoning Test structure More than half of this test contains problems for which you have to use algebraic thinking. Don't let this scare you! Think of algebra as being able to rea-son through math in a sometimes abstract, yet logical way. Algebraic thinking is ingrained in everyday life; you are already using this way of thinking without even realizing it! Do you ever calculate how much more money you need to pay your rent and bills based on what you already have in your bank account? That's one example of algebraic thinking. The types of items you will encounter on the act ual test are discussed next. We also explain ways that you can practice for the online test with this print book. Multiple-Choice Questions (More than 50%) Multiple-choice questions on the GED\u00ae Mathemati- cal Reasoning test ask you to select the best answer from four choices. To select an answer, you will click your mouse in the circle next to that answer choice. To change your answer, click the circle of another answer choice. In this book, you can practice by cir - cling the correct response to a multiple-choice questio n. Fill-in-the-Blank Questions For ll-in-the-blank questions, you will need to type in an answer or answers, rather than being presented with a selection of possible answers from which to choose. In this book, you can practice by writing in the correct answer on the given line or lines. Hot-Spot Questions For hot-spot questions, you will need to click on an area of the screen to indicate where the correct answer is located. For instance, you may be asked to plot a point by clicking on an empty graph. In this book, you can practice by identifying where the correct answer is located and marking the location on paper in the appropriate spot. Drag-and-Drop Questions To answer drag-and-drop questions, you will need to click on the correct object, hold down the mouse, and drag the object to the appropriate place in the prob-lem, diagram, chart, or graph. In this book, you can pra ctice by identifying which object will complete the problem, diagram, chart, or graph and writing it in instead of dragging it. Drop-Down Questions For drop-down questions, you will need to select the correct numerical answer or phrase to complete a sentence or problem. You will click your mouse on the arrow to show all of the answer choices. Then, you will click on your chosen answer to complete the sentence, paragraph, or equation. This type of ques-tion is similar to a multiple-choice item. calculator Use An online calculator, called TI-30XS MultiView, will be available for most of the questions. The rst ve questions on the test will be non-calculator ques-tions. These questions may deal with ordering frac-tions and decimals, using the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common factor (GCF), using the distributive property, simplifying or solving prob-lems using the rules of exponents, or identifying absolut e value, among other skills and concepts. The rest of the test will have the on-screen calculator available for you to use. 1414 - - GED MATHEMATICAL REASONING TEST If you have never used the TI-30XS MultiView calcu - lator, you should practice using it before you take the ac tual test. The GED\u00ae Testing Service has created a calcula- tor reference sheet and tutorial videos on its website to help you practice. The reference sheet will also be available for you to use during the test. However, you should be comfortable with the functions of the cal-culator before taking the test. You will not want to take extra time to read through the directions while trying to complete the problems. The reference sheet can be found at www.gedtestingservice.com. Formulas A list of formulas will be available for you to use dur - ing the test. However, it will not include basic formu- las such as the area of a rectangle or triangle, the circumf erence of a circle, and the perimeters of geo- metric gures. You will be expected to know these alrea dy. If you do not know these formulas off the top of your head, you will nd them in Chapter 4 of this book. The formulas available to you on the GED\u00ae test are in the Appendix at the end of this book. Mathematical Reasoning Review c hapters The following review chapters will help you brush up on concepts and skills. The math content has been broken into the following chapters: n Numbers and Quantities (Chapter 1) n Algebra and Functions (Chapter 2) n Graphs and Tables (Chapter 3) n Geometry Basics (Chapter 4) n Statistics and Probability (Chapter 5) If you practice a little bit of math every day, not only will you see an improvement in your test scores, but you will also notice that you are retaining informa-tion better and longer. 1515 TESTPREP_00_MATH_PTI_13-16.indd 16 3/31/15 4:51 PMBlank page chapter1 NumbeRS aNd QuaNtitieS Working with numbers and quantities allows you to deal with many problems you may encounter throughout your daily routine. Knowing what a percent is, for instance, and how to calculate it, gives you the tools you need to gure out how much an item on sale costs or what amount of interest you would pay on a student loan. This chapter reviews types and properties of numbers and how to manipulate them, such as number lines, simplest forms, least common multiples (LCMs), and square and cube roots, as well as rates, percents, and pro - portions. I ncluded throughout are practice exercises that will help reinforce the concepts discussed. The answers and explanations for all prac tice questions can be found at the end of the chapter. Rules of Numbers There are certain rules you must master before you move on to more complicated mathematics. Once you are comfortable with these skills, you can feel condent when tackling problems that have multiple steps. 17 - - __ 1__ 7__ 3 2, 8, 4 NUMBERS AND QUANTITIES The Distributive Property The distributive property does exactly what it sounds like it does\u2014distributes a number or term to other numbers or terms. Whenever you see a number outside parentheses that has another function inside, at some point you will want to use the distributive property, which means you will multiply everything inside the parentheses by that number. For instance, if we needed to expand the prob- lem 5(3 + 2), we would distribute the 5 to the 3 by multiplying 5 \u00d7 3 and then distribute the 5 to the 2 by multiplying 5 \u00d7 2. The result would be 15 + 10 = 25. The distributive property will help you when simplifying long pro blems. The next concept is better for guring out division. Least Common Multiple The least common multiple (LCM) is the lowest multiple shared by two numbers. To understand what a multiple is, think of it this way: if one number can be divided by a second number evenly, then the rst number is a multiple of the second number. For instance, 4 is a multiple of 2, 6 is a multiple of 2, and 8 is a multiple of 2. You'll see later, when we discuss the greatest common factor (GCF), that nding the LCM requires us to go in the direction opposite the one we use when nding the GCF. An easier way to think about this is to picture the multiplication tab le. Multiples are numbers that result when multiplying one number by whole num-bers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and so forth. For example, if we wanted to nd the multiples of 6, we would start by asking ourselves \"What's 6 \u00d7 1? What's 6 \u00d7 2? What's reality, a number has an innite number of multiples. However, for the purposes here, we will just list some of them: Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60.. . .L CMs are necessary when nding common denomi- nators, and common denominators are necessary when adding, s ub tracting, or comparing fractions. ___a numerator b = _____________ denominator RemembeR For example, if we wanted to order the following fractions from least to greatest, we would rst need to nd a common denominator among 2, 8, and 4. Let's break this down into steps. First let's list the multiples of each number. 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. . . . 8: 8, 16, 24, 32. . 4, 8, 12, 16, 20. . . . Then, let's nd the smallest number they all share\u2014 that they have in common. This is the LCM. In this case, it is 8. 2: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10. . . . 8: 8, 16, 24, 32. . 4, 8, 12, 16, 20. . . . Next, let 's write equivalent fractions with the least common multiple as the new denominator. Remem- ber, whatever number you multiply the original denominator b y to get the new denominator, you have to multiply the original numerator by that same number to get the new numerator. Keep in mind that in this way you're really just multiplying the fraction by 1 and not actually changing it. 1818 - - NUMBERS AND QUANTITIES __ 1 \u00d7 __ 4 __ 8- __ 2 __ 3 10 \u00f7 2= 5 So, we can easily see from the new, equivalent frac- tions that the order of these fractions from least to __ 1__ 3__ 6 greatest is 2, 4, 8. 1 This also works if we wanted to subtract __ 2 from __ 7 8 . We would use the same equivalent fractions as previously: See how the LCM is useful? As mentioned before, we also will need to nd the greatest common factor when working with numbers. Greatest Common Factor A number that divides evenly into a second number is referred to as a factor of the second number. For instance, 2 is a factor of 4, 6, 8, and so on. The great - est common factor (GCF) of two or more numbers is the largest number that is a factor of the two or more numbers you are considering. Finding the GCF between two or more numbers is nec essary to reduce fractions (i.e., to put fractions in their lowest terms). This is often necessary for answering questions and is also really useful for sim-plifying complex questions and being able to answer them faste r. 6For instance, if you need to put __ 10 in lowest terms, rst you need to nd the GCF of 6 and 10. An easy way to do this is to list the factors of each num- ber and see which number is the largest factor the two numbers share: 6: 1, 2, 3, 6 10: 1, 2, 5, 10 The biggest factor that both 6 and 10 share is 2. Ther efore, let's divide both 6 and 10, the numerator and denominator, respectively, by 2: Because you are dividing by the same number\u2014in 2this case, __ 2 \u2014you are essentially dividing by 1. As you know, any number divided by 1 yields the original 3 number. Therefore, even though the answer of __ 5 6 looks different, it is equivalent to __ 10 and is in lowest terms. If a question asks you to rewrite an expression using the dist ributive property, nd the GCF of the two numbers and then divide each number by the GCF. Practice 1. Write the following expression in lowest terms using the distrib utive property. 64 - 8. _________ SimPLeSt FOR m Simplest form refers to the most simplified version of an answer. For instance, even 6 3though ___ 10 and __ 5 are equivalent (as illus- trated in the previous section), the fraction __3 5 is in simplest form because it cannot be reduced any further. The reason this is so important is that, unless instructed other - wise, you should always give the answer in simplest form on the test. Number Lines On the GED\u00ae test, you may be asked to put fractions, decimals, and rational numbers in order. Likely, you 1919 ONeS 4 . . . 4 5 5 . 2 3 5 2.

There are a few things to keep in mind when arranging numbers on a number line from least to greatest. Practice Watch Out for the Negatives! As you go further to the left on the number line, the absolute values of the numbers get BIGGER (an explanation of absolute value is included later in this chapter). If negative numbers scare you, just think about them in terms of money. If you keep spending more money than you have in your bank account, you go deeper and deeper into debt. If you have only $3 in your bank account and you buy a sandwich for $5, you will be $2 in the hole. That number is located two spaces to the left of 0 on this number line: -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 This is true for bigger numbers as well. If you have $100 in your checking account and you spend $150, you owe $50. So your bank account\u2014before over - draft fees of course\u2014is negative $50. On a number line lik e the next one, -50 would be 50 spaces to the 0 1 Ordering Decimals Place values to the right of the decimal point repre-sent parts of a whole. The names of the place values look similar to those of numbers to the left of the decimal point. However, note the -ths at the end of each name in the chart. left of 0. -100 -80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40 60 80 100 Find Common Denominators to Order Fractions The surest way to be certain that you are ordering fractions correctly is to rewrite the fractions so they share a common denominator. Review the least com-mon multiple section for a more detailed explanation of rewriting equivalent fractions. Let's practice this skill with the following question. The rst number listed in the table is read, \"Four and three tenths.\" To illustrate this as a mixed number (a whole number and a fraction), it is written like it sounds: 4 103. The second number listed is read as \"three and forty-ve hundredths.\" As a mixed number, it is writ- ___ 45ten 3100. The third number listed above is read as \"ve and two hundred thirty-ve thousandths.\" It is writ- ____ 235ten 51,000. To order decimals on the number line, you can use the previous strategy of writing decimals as frac-tions with a power of 10 (10, 100, 1,000, 10,000, and so fo rth). 2020 - - NUMBERS AND QUANTITIES 2. x1 = x Examples: 71 = 7; 1001 = 100 4. xmxn = xm + n Example: 22 \u00b7 23 = 22 + 3 = 25 6. (xm)n = xmn Example: (42)3 = 4(2)(3) = 46 For example, let's order the following decimals from least to greatest: 1.2, 1.40, 1.15, 1.67, and 1.53. Each of these decimals has two digits to the right of the de cimal point except the number 1.2. However, adding zeros at the end of a decimal number does not change the value: 1.2 is equivalent to 1.20, which is also equivalent to 1.200. The pattern continues. To make the comparison easier, simply add a zer o to 1.2 so that each number has the same amount of digits to the right of the decimal point. Then, note that each denominator will be 100 since there are two digits to the right of each decimal point (the hun-dredths place). 1.20 = 1___ 20 100 1.40 = 1___ 40 100 1.15 = 1___ 15 100 1.67 = 1___ 67 100 1.53 = 1___ 53 100 Since each fraction has the same denominator, it is easy to determine the order of the numbers: 1.15, 1.2, 1.4, 1.53, and 1.67. It is also helpful to think about decimals in terms of money. For instance, 1.2 is like $1.20. We all know that this amount is a little more than $1. __ 3Another example: 3.76 is like $3.76\u2014it is about 4 of the way between $3 and $4. The following number line illustrates this concept. 1.2 3.76 0 1 2 3 4 Laws of e xponents An exponent\u2014written as a small number to the upper right of a number\u2014indicates how many times a number should be multiplied by itself. For instance, 10 2 (read as 10 to the second power) means 10 \u00d7 10, or 100; and 103 (read as 10 to the third power) means 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10, or 1,000. There are six laws of exponents: 1. x0 = 1 Examples: 20 = 1; 60 = 1 xm - n xn Example: __ 35 = 35 - 2 = 33 32 Squares and Cubes Squaring and cubing numbers uses the exponents 2 and 3. When you square a number, you multiply a number by itself: 4 2 = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 Notice that this is differ ent from multiplying by 2. If we multiply 4 \u00d7 2, we get 8\u2014not 16. When you cube a number, you multiply a num- ber by itself, using the number three times: 43 = 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 = 64 Notice that this is differ ent from multiplying by 3. If we multiply 4 \u00d7 3, we get 12\u2014not 64. 2121 n n - - NUMBERS AND QUANTITIES To square or cube a number means you are rais- ing that number to the second or third power. The 2 and the 3 are exponents. You'll notice that when you raise a number to a power, the number grows quickly. You may have heard people say things like \"The pop-ulation has grown exponentially.\" That just means it increased v ery quickly. Square Roots and Cube Roots Roots undo exponents. Square rooting and cube rooting involve backwards thinking. For instance, if a problem states, \"What is the square root of 16?\" it is asking you for the number that equals 16 when mul-tiplied by itself. Mathematically, it is written 16 = ? So, what number, when multiplied by itself (i.e., when squared), yields 16? Four! 4 \u00d7 4 = 16 42 = 16 So, 16 = 4. Cube roots function in the same way. To nd a cube root of a number, ask yourself, \"What number used three times in multiplication gives me this num-ber?\" Mathematically, cube roots are written like the follo wing: 3 27. So, what is the 3 27? What number multiplied by itself three times yields 27? Three! 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 = 27 33 = 27 So, 327 = 3 It is also important to understand how to sim- plify expressions that contain roots. We will review this pr ocess with two forms\u2014whole numbers and fractions. Whole Numbers ab = a b Example: Simplify 27. 27 = 39 =3 9 = 33 Practice 3. Simplify 20 12. _____________ Fractions a= a b b Example: Simplify 4 .9 4 2 4 = = 3 9 9 absolute Value The absolute value of a number tells us how far away it is from zero. For instance, the number 8 is a dis-tance of 8 from zero. The number 400 is a distance of 400 fro m zero. What about the number -10? Think about it. Even though it is a negative number, it is still a distance of 10 from zero\u2014just to the left of zero instead of to the right. The absolute value is written mathematically like the fol lowing examples: |8| = 8 (Read: the absolute value of 8 is 8) |-10| = 10 (Read: the absolute value of -10 is 10) You may be asked to nd the absolute value of the distance b etween two numbers. What does that mean? It means to nd the difference between the numbers (subtract) and then record the absolute value of the answer. 2222 - - NUMBERS AND QUANTITIES a. b. c. d. a. b. c. d.

Find the absolute value of the difference be tween 5 and 3. __________ Scientific Notation What does it mean to write a number in scientic notation? The general format for a number written in scientic notation is a \u00d7 10 b. An example of a num- ber written in scientic notation is 2.6 \u00d7 104. Scientic notation is a way to write really big or real ly small numbers in shorthand. There are two rules when it comes to writing numbers in scientic notation: 1. The number should always be between 0 and 10. 2. The exponent is dictated by the number of spac es the decimal point moves to the left or to the right. For instance, say we want to write the number 9,800,000 in scientic notation. Since the number needs to be between 0 and 10, our decimal point is going to be moved from the right of the last zero to the right of 9. Thus, the number becomes 9.8. How-ever, we need this number to be equivalent to 9,800,000, so we can't stop at 9.8. This is where the second rule comes in. We need to multiply by a power of 10. Count how many spaces you moved the deci-mal point to the left . Did you get six? Good. So, we write the number as 9.8 \u00d7 106. Suppose we have a really small number\u2014say, 0.000047\u2014that ne eds to be written in scientic nota- tion. We are going to approach this the same way. First, we need to write a number that is between 0 and 10: 4.7. Next, we need to multiply by a power of 10 to make this notation represent the original num-ber. To get to 4.7, we moved the decimal point ve spac es to the right. We reflect this in the power of 10 by writing a negative exponent: 4.7 \u00d7 10-5. To convert a number in scientic notation to a standard n umber, simply reverse the steps. 9.8 \u00d7 106 indicates that we need to move the decimal point six spaces to the right to get a large number: 9,800,000. 4.7 \u00d7 10-5 indicates that we need to move the decimal point ve spaces to the left to get a really small number: 0.000047. So, how does scientic notation play out in the real world? Suppose you were measuring a planet's distance from the sun in kilometers (km). That would end up being a pretty large number! Instead of writ-ing a number with a bunch of place values, you can simply and concisely write it using scientic notation. Or suppose you needed to give a pipe's width in terms of meters (m). Instead of writing a long number, you could concisely write it in scientic notation. Practice 6. Which of the following is the 7. Pluto is 5,914,000,000 km from the sun. This distance can be written in scientic notation 2323 a. b. c. d. - - ___ ___ 37 100 = 0.37 = 37% NUMBERS AND QUANTITIES Percentages When you break down the word percent into two parts\u2014per and cent\u2014it means \"for every hundred.\" A percentage conveys a number that is a part of, or a fraction of, 100. For instance, 37% means 37 out of 100. Thus, it could also be written as 37 100. Let's not stop there! Not only can we write 37% as a fraction, but we can also write is as a decimal. Remember, to have a denominator of 100, there must 37be two digits to the right of the decimal point. So ___ 100 is read as \"thirty-seven hundredths.\" A s a decimal, it is written as 0.37. Simply take the original percentage of 37 and then move the decimal point two spaces to the left to get 0.37. Not three spaces. Not one space. Always two. Why? It is representative of hundredths, or per hundred. So, 37% is equivalent to 0.37. (This is important to remember, because when we use per- centages in real-world problems, we will be convert- ing them into decimals.) Fractions, decimals, and percentages are equiva- lent: How does this make sense? Well, they all express val- ues that are parts, or fractions, of 100. The following are some problems that deal with pe rcentages in real-life situations. Simple Interest Suppose you took out a ve-year car loan for $12,000, with an interest rate of 6.5% per year. You might want to gure out how much money you will be paying in interest. To solve this problem, we need to use the simple inte rest formula: I = prt, where p = the principal bal- ance, r = the interest rate, and t = the duration or time. Before we start substituting numbers to solve this p roblem, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal. Remember, we just move the decimal point two spa ces to the left. So 6.5% becomes 0.065. When we substitute values into the formula, we ge t the following equation: I = (12,000)(0.065)(5) I = 3,900 Therefore, you will be paying a total amount of $3,900 in interest over the course of the ve-year loan. Practice 8. If Veronica deposits $5,000 in her savings account with a yearly interest rate of 9% and leaves the money in the account for eight years, how much interest will her money earn? $360,000 $45,000 $3,600 $450 Tax If you go to the store to purchase household items, you take into account the tax in your total, right? How do you do that? Let's say that you spend $46.98 on household items before tax. If you are taxed 7%, what is your total bill? Like the previous problem, you need to convert the 7% to a decimal. Move the decimal point two spaces to the left to get 0.07. This is the number to be used in the problem. To nd how much tax you pay, multiply the total c ost before tax, $46.98, by 0.07: 46.98 \u00d7 0.07 = 3.2886 Since we are talking about money, let's round that to $3.29. W e are not done yet, though! The question asks for the total bill, so we need to add $3.29 to $46.98. When we do that, we end up with $50.27. 2424 - - NUMBERS AND QUANTITIES a. $587.50 b. c. d. ___ 75 800 = 0.09375 Markups/Markdowns Every month you budget for fun money. You are able to put aside $30 each month. You see a pair of shoes that you really want for $90, but you have only $65 saved. The next week the shoes go on sale for 25% off. Do you have enough money to buy them? To solve this problem, we need to gure out the sale p rice of the shoes. The rst step is to convert the percentage to a decimal. So 25% becomes 0.25 when we move the decimal point two spaces to the left. Multiply 0.25 by 90, the price of the shoes, to gure out how much they are marked down to: 90 \u00d7 0.25 = 22.5 Remember, $22.50 is not the sale price of the shoes, bu t the amount taken off the original $90. So, you need to subtract $22.50 from $90, which results in $67.50. If you have only $65, unfortunately you do not have enough money. Practice 9. Mr. Jordan is planning to buy a treadmill. The tr eadmill he wants is on sale at 10% off the retail price of $700. Mr. Jordan has an addi-tional coupon for 5% off after the discount has b een applied. What is the nal cost of the treadmill, not including any taxes or assembly fees? $598.50 $630.00 $668.50 Percentage Increase/Decrease Your rent went from $800 a month to $875 per month. To consider whether the increase is fair, thinking about it in terms of a percentage is helpful. To nd the percentage increase, we rst have to gure out how much more the current price is than the original price. By doing a simple subtraction pr oblem, we nd that $875 - $800 = $75. To gure out the percentage increase, we divide 75 by the total original amount (remember, percentages convey parts of wholes): To gure out the percentage increase from this deci- mal, we need to use backwards thinking. To convert pe rcentages to decimals, we move the decimal two spaces to the left. So to convert decimals to percent-ages, we move the decimal two spaces to the right. 0.09375 = 9.375% Let's round our answer to the nearest tenth, 9.4%. Rates We use rates every day without even realizing it. What are rates? Miles per hour (mph), price per pound, and persons per square mile are all examples of rates. They are written most often as fractions, with the numerator as the rst unit listed and the denomina-tor as the second unit listed. Let's look at some appli-cations of the concept. Speed It took Denise 1 hour and 45 minutes to walk a four-mile trail. How many miles per hour did she walk, rounded to the nearest tenth of a mile? T o nd how many miles per hour, we write our fraction with the number of miles as the numerator : _________ 4 milesand the number of hours as the denominator1.75 hours. This is now a simple division problem: 4 \u00f7 1.75 = 2.28.

Approximately 3.82 mil-lion people live within 503 square miles in Los Ange-les, CA. What is the difference of people per square mile be tween these two cities? To nd the persons per square mile in Minne- 392,880 peopleapolis, we need to rst write our fraction: _____________ 58 square miles . There are 6,774 people per square mile in Minneapo-lis (rounded from 6,773.79). To nd the people per square mile in Los Ange- 3,820,000 peopleles, we write another fraction: ______________ 503 square miles . There are 7,594 people per square mile in Los Angeles (rounded from 7,594.43). To nd the difference of people per square mile between Minneapolis and Los Angeles, we subtract 6,774 from 7,594. 7,594 - 6,774 = 820 people per square mile Proportions Proportions are two equivalent ratios or fractions. For instance, if two fractions are proportional, one can be obtained from the other by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the same number.

Solve for x: __ __ __ __ __ __ NUMBERS QUANTITIES answers and e xplanations Chapter Practice 1. 8(8 - 1). Since 64 can be divided by 8, and 8 can b e divided by 8, 8 is the GCF. If we then divide both 64 and 8 by 8, we can create the new expression 8(8 - 1), which has that whole parentheses look of the distributive property we looked at before. 2. 4 6 70 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 18 8 8 First, rewrite the fractions so that the denomi - nator (the bottom number) of each fraction is the same. To do this, look for what number all three numbers\u20142, 8, and 4\u2014can go into. The answer is 8. One of the fractions already has a denominator of 8, so that fraction is good to go. Changing the denominator of the other two __1 4 3 6fractions, becomes 8 , and 4 becomes 8 .2 Now it is easy to see that 84 is smaller than 86, which is smaller than 87. 3. 4 15. Both of these numbers, 20 and 12, have a factor of 4, which is a perfect square. Therefore, these square roots can be simplied. 20 = 45 = 4 5 = 12 = 43 = 4 3 = 2325 So, 20 12 = 25 23. When simplied further, the answer is 415. 4. |3 - 8| = |-5| = 5 5. 2. |5 - 3| = |2| = 2. If the numbers were r eversed, the absolute value of the difference would be |3 - 5| = |-2| = 2. Either way you write the numbers, as long as you are taking the abso-lute value of the difference between the two n umbers, you will always get the same answer. 6. b. Scie ntic notation expresses a number as the product of a number between 1 and 10, includ- ing 1 but excluding 10, and a power of 10. If the n umber is greater than 1, then the exponent of 10 is non-negative. So, to write 316.72 in scien-tic notation, move the decimal point two pla ces to the left to get a number between 1 and 10, and write the power of 10 as 2 because you moved the decimal point two places to the left. 7. b. A n umber in scientic notation is written as a number that is at least 1 but less than 10, mul- tiplied by a power of 10. The power of 10 is the n umber of places that the decimal is moved to transform the number into decimal notation (regular numbers). If the decimal point in the number 5.914 is moved nine places to the right, the number becomes 5,914,000,000. 8. c. I n the formula I = prt , the amount of money deposited is called the principal, p. The interest rate per year is represented by r, and t represents the number of years. The interest rate must be written as a decimal. Here, p = 5,000, r = 9% = 0.09, and t = 8. Substitute these numbers for the respective variables and multiply: I = 5,000 \u00d7 0.09 \u00d7 8 = $3,600. 9. b. T his question requires taking your time and making sure you do all the required steps. Do one step at a time to arrive at the correct answer. First, nd the sale price after the 10% has been deducted (remember, 10% is the same as 0.10): $700 - 0.10($700) = - $70 = $630 N ow, apply the 5% coupon to the discounted price of $630. Remember, 5% is the same as 0.05. Be sure to subtract from $630, not from the o riginal price of $700. 0.05($630) QUANTITIES 10. b. D ividing 5,100 miles by three hours gives you the speed of the jet in miles per hour: 5,100 3 = 1,700 miles per hour Therefore, to fly a distance of 22,950 miles, divide the distance 22,950 miles by 1,700 miles 22,950per hour, which equals = 13.5 hours.1,700 11. c.

Let's set up a proportional rela-tionship by writing two fractions. Let's use x to r epresent the number of words per 12 minutes: _____1,000 __ x = 5 12 Cross multiply to solve for x: 1,000 \u00d7 12 = 5x 12,000 = 5x 12,000 5 = 2,400 13. $45. One way to nd the cost of nine used b ooks is to gure out the relationship between the number of books and the price of the other bundles. Do you notice a pattern? Do you see that each time the number of books is multi-plied by 5 to get the price of each bundle? If we m ultiply 9 by 5, the answer is $45. Another way to nd the cost of the bundle of 9 books is to set up two equivalent fractions and solve for x: 6 9 = 30 x 6x = 30 \u00d7 9 6x = 270 270x = 6 x = 45 14. -5 and 5. W e are only concerned with the denominator when talking about undened expressions. We need to nd the two values of x that make the denominator equal to zero. Let's set up an equation and solve for x: x 2 - 25 = 0 x2 = 25 x 2 = 25 x = 5 and -5 Remember, a square root is the number that, when multiplied by itself, gives you the number you start with. In this problem, we are looking for the number that when multiplied by itself yields 25, which is 5. Also, when you square a negative number, you get a positive answer. So, -5 \u00d7 -5 also equals 25. Therefore, the two values of x that make the equation undened are 5 and -5. Numbers and Quantities Review 1. 1.0005, 1.005, 3 2 , 15. All of these numbers, when rewritten, contain the digits 1 and 5. The num- _____5 5ber 1.005 = 1 1,000, the number 1.0005 = 110,000, 3 1and 2 = 1 2 = 1.5. Therefore, 1.0005 is less than 1.005, which, in turn, is less than 1.5. The great- est number is 15. 2. c. T o answer this question, it is helpful to remember that the absolute value of the num- ber is the distance between that number and 0. T he scale of the number line is 3-unit incre- ments. Thus, point A is -12 and point B is 6. To nd the diff erence between these two numbers, simply make a subtraction problem and take the absolute value. Choice a includes +12, not -12. Choice b reflects the sum, not the differ - ence. For choice d to be correct, it should read |6 - (-12)|. 3030 - - ________ ________ NUMBERS AND QUANTITIES 3. a.

To answer this question, it is helpful t o recall that words per minute is a rate. First, notice that the quiz results were for 2 minutes, not 1 minute. We need to nd words per min-ute. To do this, simply divide each number of w ords typed by 2 to nd the words per minute for each person. Since each number is being divided by the same number, we only need to do this for the greatest and the smallest number 90 words 59 wordsof words typed. 2 minutes = 45 wpm. = 2 minutes 29.5 wpm. To nd the difference, simply sub-tract 29.5 from 45 to get 15.5 wpm. Alterna- tively, subtract the smallest number of words t yped from the largest number and divide the difference by 2. 5. b. A 15% t ip on a charge of $15 equals $2.25. Therefore, the total amount that Samantha paid was $15.00 + $2.25 = $17.25. The difference equals $20.00 - $17.25 = $2.75. 6. b. T o nd the cost of one can of tomatoes, divide the cost of six cans ($5.34) by 6: $5.34 \u00f7 6 = $0.89 of tomatoes costs $0.89. Next, to nd the cost of 11 cans, multiply $0.89 by 11: $0.89 \u00d7 11 = $9.79 T he cost of 11 cans of tomatoes is $9.79. 7. b. B ecause 1 inch on the map represents 24 miles, 3 inches on the map represent 3 \u00d7 24, or 72 miles. 8. c. A n umber can be written in scientic nota- tion as the product of a number between 1 and 10, including 1 and excluding 10, and a power of 10. If a number is less than 1, the power of 10 is negative. So, to write 0.00231 in scientic notation, start at the decimal point and move it to the right until you have one non-zero digit to the left of it. You must move the decimal point three places to get 2.31, so you multiply that number by 10 to the power of -3 because the number 0.00231 is smaller than 1 and you moved the decimal point three places to the right. So, in scientic notation: 0.00231 = 2.31 \u00d7 10 -3 3131 - - NUMBERS AND QUANTITIES 9. c. Sum is a key word that means add. You need to add the numbers 12.03 and 4.5. Place the numbers one over the other and line up the decimal points. 12.03 +4.5 Because 4.5 does not show as many decimal pla ces as 12.03, add a zero on the end of 4.5 to make 4.50. Then each number will show the same number of places to the right of the deci- mal. These will be easier to add. 12.03 +4.50 Now add each column one at a time starting on the r ight. 12.03 +4.50 16.53 10. 80. First, divide the denominator on the left int o the new denominator on the right: 100 \u00f7 10 = 10. Then, multiply 10 by the numerator on the left to solve for x: 8 \u00d7 10 = 80. 3232 chapter2 AlgebrA ANd FuNctioNS In this chapter, we're reviewing the basic principles associated with algebra and functions. Understanding these principles will lead you to being able to recognize and work through these problems as you go. Alg ebra is an organized system of rules that help solve problems for unknowns. This organized sys - tem of rules is similar to rules for a board game. To be successful at algebra, like any game, you must learn the r ules of play. As you work through this chapter, be sure to pay special attention to any new words you may encounter. Once you understand what is being asked of you, it will be much easier to grasp algebraic concepts. The answers and explanations for all practice questions are at the end of the chapter. Signed Numbers Let's start with rules for signed numbers. When solving problems, there are a few rules to remember about signed numbers (i.e., + and - numbers). 33 - - ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS Multiplication and Division Multiplication and division have straightforward rules. The product involving an odd number of nega-tives is negative, and the product involving an even numbe r of negatives is positive, assuming that none of the numbers is zero. Rule 1: (+)(+) = + and +/+ = + Example: 5 \u00b7 5 = 25 Rule 2: (-)(-) = + and -/- = + Example: -5 \u00b7 -5 = 25 Rule 3: (-)(+) = - and -/+ = - Example: -5 \u00b7 5 = -25 Practice 1. If n is a positive number, will the solution to the following problem be positive or negative? (-____ n)3 n . ____________ Adding and subtracting with negative numbers can be a bit trickier. However, there are rules to help you with this as well. Addition Rule 1: When you add a positive to a positive, the answer is positive. 60 + 34 = 94 Rule 2: When you add a negative number to a neg ative number, the answer is negative. -20 + -31 = -51 If you start with $20 of debt and pick up $31 more of deb t, you have a total of $51 of debt. If you think about it as it is on the number line, both numbers are going in the same direction\u2014to the left. Rule 3: When you add a positive and a negative numb er, you simply need to nd the difference between the two numbers. To determine the sign of the answer, use the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. Let's look at 60 - 84. On the number line, the two numbers are going in op posite directions. In this problem, even though 60 is written rst, it is smaller. To nd the absolute value of the answer, switch the numbers around: 84 - 60. This equals 24. Now, which number has the great er absolute value? -84. So the answer is negative. 60 - 84 = -24. If this is confusing, think about it in terms of money. If you have $60 and spend $84, you are in debt $24. Subtraction Rule 1: Adding a negative is the same as sub- tracting a positive. 60 + -9 is the same as 60 - 9. Rule 2: Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding a p ositive. 70 - -31 is the same as 70 + 31 Order of Operations The order of operations helps you to correctly solve complex problems that include more than one opera-tion. These are rules as well, and ensure that everyone follo ws the same steps to solve a given problem. The rules of order are: 1. Parentheses 2. Exponents and roots 3. Multiplication and division 4. Addition and subtraction The operations in rules 2, 3, and 4 are performed as they aris e from left to right in a problem. You can remember them easily by this acronym: PEMDAS. You can also remember the acronym by reciting, \"Purple Elephants Marching Down a Street\" or \"Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally.\" However you remember it, remember it! It will guide your steps when solving problems. 3434 - - ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS a. b. c. d. Example Solve 4x2 + 3(1 - x), when x = -2. a. 21 b. 25 c. 73 d. 77 First, let's substitute -2 for every x and rewrite the expression: 4(-2)2 + 3(1 - -2) While it may be tempting to go from left to right, we need to be careful. We cannot multiply -2 \u00d7 4 and then square the answer because Exponents come before Multiplication in the order of operations. Plus, we also have Parentheses in the second half of the problem, and the order of operations indicates we do them rst. Always. So let's go through the steps one by one: 1. We have Parentheses: (1 - -2). When subtract-ing a negative number, the negatives turn into addition. Thus, (1 - -2) really is (1 + 2), which equals 3. Our problem now reads: 4(-2)2 + 3(3) 2. We have Exponents: (-2)2. This 4. Our prob- lem now reads: 3(3) 3. We 4(4) and 3(3). 4(4) = 16 and 3(3) = 9. Our problem now reads: 16 + 9 4. We have Addition: 16 + 9, which equals 25. Therefore, the answer is choice b, 25! You get choice a, 21, if you don't do the paren- theses rst and just multiply 3 \u00d7 1 and the n subtract -2. You get choice c, 73, if you multiply 4 \u00d7 -2 and then square it, along with not computing the paren-theses rst. You get choice d, 78, if you multiply 4 \u00d7 -2 and then square it but still compute the second half correctly. Practice 2. Solve (52 + 64\u0003) \u00f7 10. ___________ 3. Evaluate the following expression: (5 - 3) \u00d7 (4 + 4 \u00f7 2) 6 8 10 12 Performing operations on e xpressions Keeping in the theme of operations, let's look at the rules and methods used to perform operations on expressions. (An expression is a combination of num-bers and/or symbols that indicate a specic value.) Distributive Property with Linear Expressions We looked at the distributive property in the previous chapter. Remember, it does exactly what it sounds like it does\u2014distributes a number or term to other num-bers or terms. Parentheses and multiplication are always in volved. For instance, if we needed to expand the prob- lem 5(3 + y), we would distribute the 5 to the 3 by multiplying 5 \u00d7 3, and then distribute the 5 to the y by multiplying 5 \u00d7 y. The result would be 15 + 5y. Adding and Subtracting Polynomial Expressions When adding and subtracting terms in polynomial expressions, we can only add and subtract like terms. Numbers can be added to numbers, x2's can be added to x2's, y3's can be added to y3's, xyz's can be added to xyz's, and so forth. Example Simplify (6x2 + 2xy - 9) - (4x3 + 2x2 ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS This looks complicated, but really it is just adding and subtracting coefcients\u2014the numbers in front of the variables\u2014of like terms. One thing important to note in this problem is that we are subtracting a quantity. This means that the minus sign needs to be distributed to each of the terms in parentheses after it. The minus sign will make each of the terms in parentheses its opposite. The rst step in simplifying this problem is to rewrite it with the distributed negative: 6x2 + 2xy - 9 - 4x3 - 2x2 + 5xy - 8 The second step in simplifying is to combine like terms. 6x2 - 2x2 = 4x2 2xy + 5xy = 7xy -9 - 8 = -17 -4x3 has no other term like it, so it stays the same. The last step is to rewrite the expression with the co mbined terms: -4x3 + 4x2 + 7xy - 17 (Note: It's helpful to write the terms so that the value of the exponents goes from greatest to least as you read from left to right. Also, remember that positive numbers will have a plus sign in front while negative numbers will have a minus sign.) Multiplying Polynomial Expressions When multiplying polynomial expressions, we don't have to worry about combining like terms. To multi-ply two expressions, simply multiply the like terms to gether to yield an answer that is a combination of the two terms. Here are some examples: (5x)(6x) = 30x2: 5 \u00d7 6 = 30 and x \u00b7 x = x2. (4xy)(3x) = 12x2y: 4 \u00d7 3 = 12, x \u00b7 x = x2, and y stays the same. Dividing Polynomial Expressions When dividing polynomial expressions, we are look- ing for ways to reduce and/or cancel values to yield a simplied answer. For example, let's say we were asked to simplify the following expression: We need to call to mind our knowledge about reduc- ing fractions as well as our knowledge about dividing exp onents. To simplify this expression, let's look at the numbers rst. Can we reduce at all? Yes! We can divide 4 by 2, and then we are left with a 2 in the numerator only: Is there anything else we can simplify? There are x' s and y's in both the numerator and the denominator, so we can divide the denominator into the numera- tor. Let's take the terms one at a time: __ y3 y = y2 When dividing exponents, we subtract their values. Thus, 3 - 1 = 2, which is why we are still left with y2 in the example. Note Our complete answer is 2y2x. Practice 7 _____ x4y5 Simplify the following expression: x5y6. ______ 4. Multiplying Binomials (FOIL) We FOIL when we are multiplying two binomials, or two expressions with two terms each. For example, 3636 - - ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS _________ take (x + 2)(x - 4). To solve this problem, apply FOIL: multiply firsts, outsides, insides, lasts. Multiply Firsts: (x + 2)(x - 4) = x2 Multiply Outsides: (x + 2)(x - 4) = x2 - 4x Multiply Insides: (x + 2)(x - 4) = x2 - 4x + 2x Multiply Lasts: (x + 2)(x - 4) = x2 - 4x + 2x - 8 We get the nal answer after combining the two like terms, -4x and 2x: x2 - 2x - 8 Practice 5. Apply FOIL to the following multiplication pro blem: (y + 2)(y - 2). _______________ Factoring When factoring, we are going backwards from FOIL. Let's look at an example to illustrate this concept. Factor the polynomial expression x2 - 3x + 2. To do this, we must keep FOIL in mind. Remember, when we were multiplying two binomi- als, we multiplied the rst two terms together to get the rst term of our answer. Thus, the rst terms of our binomials need to equal x2 when multiplied together. So far, we know the following: (x )(x ) The next step of FOIL was to multiply the outsides and the insides to get two different products. To obtain the nal answer, we combined these two products to get our middle term. Thus, when factoring, we must nd a combination that when adding the products of the outsides and the insides, we get a sum of -3x . However, before proceeding, we need to also kee p in mind that the last term of the answer when applying FOIL is the result of the product of the last terms of the binomials. So, not only do the products of the outsides and the insides need to combine to equal -3x, but the lasts need to yield a product of +2. x2 - 3x + 2 = (x + ?)(x + ?) What two numbers when added equal -3, but when multiplied equal +2? What about -2 and -1? -2 + -1 = -3 -2 \u00d7 -1 = 2 Let's plug these numbers in! When factored, x2 - 3x + 2 = (x - 2)(x - 1). To check, we can FOIL our answer to make sure we factored correctly. Multiply Firsts: (x - 2)(x - 1) = x2 Multiply Outsides: (x - 2)(x - 1) = x2 - 1x Multiply Insides: (x - 2)(x - 1) = x2 - 1x - 2x Multiply Lasts: (x - 2)(x - 1) = x2 - 1x - 2x + 2 Combine the two like terms to get the nal answer: x2 - 3x + 2. Practice 6. Factor y4 - 25. ________________ 7. For what values of x is the func t ion f(x) undened? f(x) = x2 - 33 x + 2. _________________ Substitution The principle of substitution applies to any variable expression\u2014linear, rational, or polynomial\u2014where 3737 n Example: The difference of 5 and 4 is 1 (i.e., 5 - 4 = 1). n Example: 4x2 + 3x - 2; 4 and 3 are coefcients. n Example: Six times the quantity of 5 plus x2; 6(5 + x2). - - ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS values are given to replace the variable(s). Once the variables are replaced by the given values, the order of operations is used to solve or simplify the problem. Example 3 1Given the equation V = s , solve for V if s = __ 4. To solve for V, we rst need to replace every s from 1the original equation with the given value of __ 4. So, the equation now reads: V__ 1 = ( 4)3 1When we solve 4 4= 64 Practice 8. What is 2x2 + x - 4 when x = -3? __________ Solving Problems and e quations Your GED\u00ae test will expand on basic math concepts to test them via more complex problems and equa-tions. This section introduces the question types you will fa ce on the exam. Word-to-Symbol Translations There are several key words to remember when trans-lating word problems into mathematical sentences. Sum: A sum of two or more numbers is the answer to an a ddition problem. n Example: The sum of 3 and 5 is 8 (i.e., 3 + 5 = 8). Difference: A diffe rence between two numbers is the answer to a subtraction problem. Quotient: A quotient is the answer to a division problem. n Example: The quotient of 18 and 6 is 3 (i.e., 18 \u00f7 6 = 3). Product: A product is the answer to a multiplication problem. n Example: The product of 8 and 9 is 72 (i.e., 8 \u00d7 9 = 72). Coefcient: A coefcient is the number or symbol multiplied by a variable in an algebraic expression. n Example: y has a coefcient of 9 (i.e., 9y). Quantity of: \"The quantity of\" indicates that there are two or more terms combined to make one term. This combination of multiple terms into one is illus-trated with parentheses. Also , pay attention to the wording and the order of the te rms stated. For instance, where is the word from placed in phrases that indicate subtraction? \"Subtract y from 5\" is translated as \"5 - y\" and not \"y - 5.\" This is because the phrase states that y is the term being subtracted, and not 5. Another phrase to keep in mind is less than. Which number is less than which? It is very important to pay close attention. n \"Two less than x\" is translated \"x - 2\" because the phrase indicates that we are talking about a num-ber that is 2 less than the value of x (i.e., x is g reater). n \"14 less than 2y\" is translated as \"2y - 14.\" The phrase indicates that we are starting with a value 3838 - - ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS n n n of 2y and then subtracting 14. Whatever the answer is, we know it is 14 less than the value of 2y. Now, what if the problem said, \"14 is less than 2y\"? That one word \"is\" changes everything. It is now a mathematical inequality with the words \"is less than.\" Translated, this is 14 < 2y. (Remember, the open part of the inequality sign opens toward the bigger num-ber and points to the smaller number.) What about \"7 is greater than or equal to 4z\"? Ho w would this be written mathematically? Remem- ber, the open part of the inequality sign opens toward the big ger number. This would be written: 7 v 4z. You may also need to use word-to-symbol tr anslations when using variables to represent rela- tionships between numbers in word problems. For instance, say that Sally is twice as old as Jim. To repre- sent their ages algebraically without knowing their ac tual ages, we could use j to represent Jim's age and 2j to represent Sally's age. reMeM ber When translating words into symbols, it is important to read the problem critically, pay attention to the exact wording, and keep these key words and phrases in mind. These tips are essential to solving algebraic word problems. Practice 9. Richard has a T-shirt company. He needs to make at least $2,500 this mo nth to meet his sales goal. If each T-shirt costs $16.50, what is the minimum number of T-shirts Richard needs to sell to reach his goal? Solving Linear Equations A linear equation is an equation with one or more variables to the rst power. Examples include: 3x + 7 = -5 y = mx + b 4z - 3 + n = 2 To solve linear equations with one variable, we need to get the variable by itself on one side of the equa-tion. For instance, to nd what x is in the equation 3x + 7 = -5, we need to get x by itself. The goal is to get a mathematical sentence that reads \"x = a number.\" How do we do this? By stripping away the other numb ers through performing opposite operations. In the following example, what is on the same side of the equation as x? 3x + 7 = -5 3 and 7: x is b eing multiplied by 3 and then added to 7. To undo these operations, we need to do the op posite. reMeM ber Some opposites, or inverses, to keep in mind are: Addition and subtraction are opposites. Multiplication and division are opposites. Exponents and r oots are opposites (squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, etc.). One other very important thing to keep in mind when solving linear equations: whatever you do to one side of the equation, you must do to the other. This is so that you maintain a balance on each side of the equal sign. 3939 x = -4 10. 8x = 6x + 18 - - ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS So, looking at 3x + 7 = -5, let's perform oppo- site operations to get x by itself. Start from the num- ber furthest from x on the same side and work your way to x. 3x + 7 = -5 -7 -7 3x + 0 = -12 __ = ___ 3 3 3x -12 Practice Sol ve for y in the equation 2y - 4 = 21. Systems of Linear Equations What is a system of linear equations? It is two equa-tions, each with an x ter m and a y term. What do we do with systems of equations? The goal is to nd the solution to the system, meaning the point (x,y) where the two linear equations (lines) intersect. Here is an example of a system of linear equations: y = 2x - 4 4y = 6x + 2 There are three ways to nd the solution to these two equat ions: substitution, linear combination, and graphing. Substitution In order to nd the solution for this system of equa-tions using substitution, we rst need to isolate one of the variables in one of the equations in order to substitute an equivalent value in the other equation. Luckily, one of the equations already has isolated y: y = 2x - 4. So, the next step is to use 2x - 4 in place of y in the second equation so we can solve for x: 4(2x - 4) = 6x + 2 Distribute the 4 to each of the terms in the quantity 2x - 4: 8 x - 16 = 6x + 2 Next, get all the numbers on one side of the equation and the x quant ity on the other. Add 16 to both sides and subtract 6x from both sides: 8x - 16 = 6x + 2 + 16 + 16 -6 x -6x 2x = 18 To isolate x, w e need to divide each side of the equa- tion by 2. __2x __ 18 2 = 2 x = 9 So, if x = 9, what is the y-c oordinate that corresponds with that x-coordinate? To nd y, we substitute 9 for x into one of the original equations. y = 2x - 4 y = 2(9) - 4 y = 18 - 4 y = 14 T he solution to this system of equations is (9,14). Alwa ys write the x-coordinate rst. Linear Combination The method of linear combination is just what it sounds like: we are going to combine the two linear equations. y = 2x - 4 4y = 6x + 2 4040 - - ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS 11. The goal of combining the two equations is to elimi- nate one of the variables. We do this by adding the eq uations together. However, sometimes just adding the equations together as they are written will not cancel either variable out. Can we add y and 4y to get zero? No. Can we add 2x and 6x to get zero? No. So we need to do some manipulation. Let's focus on eliminating the x' s. If we have 6x in one equation, then we need -6x in the other equa- tion so that we get a sum of zero when they are added to gether. Is there a way to make the 2x into a -6x? Could we multiply by -3? Yes! If we multiply 2x by -3, then we must multiply the rest of the terms in that equation by -3: (-3)y = -3(2x - 4) Once the -3 is distributed to, or multiplied by, each te rm, we have -3y = -6x + 12 How does this help us? Well, let's put the two equa-tions on top of each other again, this time using the new , manipulated equation: -3y = -6x + 12 +4y = 6x + 2 Notice that when we proceed to add each term to gether, we add 6x and -6x, which equals zero. That is what we want! Then, we can solve for y since it will be the only variable: -3y = -6x + 12 +4 y = 6x + 2 y = 0 + 14 y = 14 Now that we know that y = 14, we can solve for x by substituting 14 for y into one of the original equations: y = 2x - 4 14 = 2x - 4 A dd 4 to each side to get all the numbers on one side and all the x's on the other. 14 = 2x - 4 +4 +4 18 = 2x Divide each side of the equation by 2 to isolate x. __ 18 __ 2x 2= 2 9 = x The solution to this system of equations is (9,14). Ag ain, we always write the x-coordinate rst. Practice Edward's school is having a raffle contest. Peo-ple can buy a red ticket for $10 for a chance to win a ne w TV or a blue ticket for $5 for a chance to win a brand-new bicycle. Edward sold a record high of 130 tickets for a total of $1,100. How many of each color ticket did Edward sell? __________ Graphing y = 2x - 4 4y = 6x + 2 T o solve this system of equations by graphing, we nee d to graph each of these lines. The point where these two lines intersect is the solution. How do we plot these lines? First, we need each line t o be in slope-intercept form. That is, we need each line to mirror the format y = mx + b. 4141 ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS - - n m is the slope of the line n b is the y-intercept (i.e., where the line intercepts the y-axis). n x and y are the values that make up the coordinates on the line. There are infi- nite values of x that yield corresponding values of y on the line. uSeF ul terMS iN uNderSt ANdiNg ANd coNStructiNg grAPHS The rst equation is already in slope-intercept form, so we do not need to change it. However, we need to isolate y in the second equation to get it into slope- intercept form. 4y = 6x + 2 To get rid of the coefcient of 4, we need to divide each side of the equation by 4. __ 4y 6x + 2 4 = _____ 4 __ 6 2y = 4 x + __ 4 Notice that both of the fractions are not in lowest form. We can reduce both of them by taking a factor of 2 out of each equation: __ 3 1y = 2 x + __ 2 This is now in slope-intercept form and can be graphed. When you graph the two lines, you see that the one solution that works for both is (9,14)\u2014this is the one place where the lines cross. 13 3 5 7 9 -9 -7 -5 -3 11 13 15 y (9,14) x -3 -5 -7 -9 -11 57 9 11 13 y=2x-4 y= x+ 1 2 3 2 linear i nequalities Solving linear inequalities is almost exactly the same as solving linear equations. The only difference is that there is not an equal sign. Instead, there is an inequal- ity sign (<, >, f, v). This changes the meaning of the number sentence but not the method of isolating the variable on one side of the inequality. Example Solve 2x + 4 f 0. Just like when solving linear equations (i.e., 2x + 4 = 0) we isolate x on one side of the equation: 2x + 4 f 0 2x 2 f x f -2 What does this number sentence mean? It means that to keep 2x + 4 f 0 a true statement, we can substitute any value of x that is less than or equal to -2. 4242 - - ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS 12. 13. Practice Solve y + 4 > 7. __________ Graphing the Solution on a Number Line You may be asked to graph the solution to an inequal- ity on a number line. Let's use the previous two examples to il lustrate how this is done. x f -2 We need to show on the number line that for the inequalit y 2x + 4 f 0, we can have a value of x that is less than or equal to -2. To do this, we plot a point at -2 and then shade in the rest of the number line to the left of -2. We represent that the number line goes on forever\u2014to innity\u2014by putting an arrow at the end. -5 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 Practice G raph the following inequality on the number line: y > 3. 6 Using Inequalities to Represent Real-World Situations There are times when we need to use inequality state- ments in real-world contexts. For instance, let's say that you are making a monthly budget based on a new job you just got, and you are trying to gure out how much spending money you will have each month. You make $1,500 a month after taxes. You 54 321 0 have $1,000 of expenses, including rent, utilities, and food. You want to put at least $325 in savings each month. How much spending money could you potentially have each month? We can use an inequality to represent this sce - nario. We know how much money you are starting with: $1,500. W e also know the amounts of money you will be subtracting each month: $1,000 + $325. To nd how much money is left over, we simply subtract: 1,500 - 1,000 - 325 = 175 How do we write this inequality? The scenario indi - cates that you want to save at least $325 p er month. That means you could potentially save more. You don't need to spend the remaining money. This is what indicates that we are going to have a statement of inequality\u2014it will show the limit of your monthly spending money even if you do not use it all. So, can you spend more than $175 if you want to sa ve at least $325? No! You have only $175 left after expenses and savings, so whatever you spend has to be equal to or less than $175. Represented in a number sentence, it looks like this: 1,500 - 1,000 - 325 v x; or, when simplied further, 175 v x. The variable x is the amount of spending money. Quadratic e quations A quadratic equation has a form where a, b, and c are coefcients. The square of x in the rst term is what makes this equation a quadratic equation: ax2 + bx + c = 0 The goal of solving a quadratic equation is to nd what values of x make the quadratic equation equal 4343 - - __ 2 2 = 1ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS to 0. There are several ways to solve a quadratic equa - tion to nd these x values. Quadratic Formula Let's say we needed to solve the equation x2 + 2x = 15. First, we need to convert this into the quadratic form so that we have the equation set equal to 0: x2 + 2x - 15 = 0 Next, we need to follow the quadratic formula. This formula will be available to you during the test: b \u00b1 2b 4ac x = 2a Look at the form of the quadratic equation and com - pare it to our problem: ax2 + bx + c = 0 x2 + 2x - 15 = 0 W e see that a = 1, b = 2, and c = -15. Let's substitute those values into the quadratic formula: 2 \u00b1 22 4(1)(15)x = 2(1) 2 \u00b1 4 60 x = 2 2 \u00b1 4 + 60 x = 2 2 \u00b1 64 x = 2 2 \u00b1 8 x = 2 Because of the \u00b1 sign, we have two different equa - tions that will yield two different solutions: x = _____ -2 + 8= __ 6= 32 2 x = _____ -2 - 8= ___ -10= -52 2 Therefore, the two solutions of the quadratic equa- tion x2 + 2x - 15 = 0 are x = 3 and x = -5. If you sub- stitute either of these values into the equation, the answer will be 0. Completing the Square The key to completing the square is to focus on the x2 and x terms\u2014in this case, x2 + 2x. Step 1: Get the numbers on one side of the equation and the x2 and x terms on the other: x2 + 2x - 15 = 0 + 15 + 15 x2 + 2x = 15 St ep 2: Look at the x te rm: 2 x. The coefcient of this term is 2. Divide this number in half and then square it: 12 = 1 S tep 3: Add this squared number to both sides of the eq uation. x2 + 2x + 1 = 15 + 1 Step 4: Now, we want to write the left side of the equation as a perfect square. To do this, simply take the square root of both x2 and 1 and write these terms as a quantity squared: (x + 1)2 = 16 S tep 5: Take the square root of both sides of the equa- tio n. Remember, when square rooting a number, we need to take into account that we could have squared not only a positive number but also a negative num-ber to get the value. So, (x + 1)2 = \u00b1 16 x + 1 = \u00b14 Just like when we used the quadratic formula to solve for the values of x, we have two equations that will yield two solutions to this quadratic equation: x + 1 = 4 -1 -1 x = 3 x + 1 = -4 -1 -1 x = -5 4444 - - ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS The solutions for this quadratic equation (the values of x that make this equation equal to 0) are x = 3 and x = -5. Look familiar? Good! We should get the same answers no matter which method we use. Factoring Factoring quadratic equations is easy when we under - stand how binomials are multiplied in the rst place. A b inomial is an expression with two terms. To mul- tiply binomials, simply FOIL: multiply the rst terms, outsid e terms, inside terms, and last terms. Example Expand (x - 7)(x + 4). Multiply Firsts: (x - 7)(x + 4) = x2 M ultiply Outsides: (x - + 4) + 4x M ultiply Insides: (x - 7)(x - 7x M ultiply Lasts: (x + 4) = x2 + 4x - 7x - 28 C ombine the x terms to simplify: x2 + 4x - 7x - 28 = x2 - 3x - 28 Th erefore, when factoring, we need to work back - wards. The equation x2 - 3x - 28, when factored, is (x - 7)(x + 4). The equation is equal to 0 when x = 7 and/or when x = -4. L et's look at the equation we have been working with in the other methods of solving quadratic equa- tions. x2 + 2x - 15 = 0 W e want to factor this so that we have a product of two b inomials: ( )( ) How do we decide what the terms of these binomials are? Let's think about how we expanded the previous example. We rst multiplied the rst terms of each. So, if we have x2, we must have multiplied x times x: ( x )(x ) N ext, we need to nd numbers that when combined (outsid es and insides) equal +2 and when multiplied (lasts) equal -15. What are the factors of 15? 1, 3, 5, 15. Right awa y, we see that 3 and 5 are two units apart. We need to nd a combination of these numbers that when added together yield +2 and when multiplied yield -15. (+3)(-5) = -15; this requirement is fullled! +3 - 5 = -2; but we need +2, not -2. Let's switch the signs on the numbers: (-3)(5) = -15 -3 + 5 = +2 This works! So let's plug our values into the binomials: (x - 3)(x + 5) When we factor, w e see that for this product to equal 0, x equals 3 and/or -5. These are the solutions that we got when we used the quadratic formula and com- pleted the square! Square Root Technique (Inspection) The square root technique, or inspection, is used only when we do not have an x term. For instance, for 4545 - - ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS the quadratic equation we have been working with, x2 + 2x - 15 = 0, we would not use inspection to solve for the values of x, due to the 2x term. Let's draw a picture: 2w However, if we had x2 = 36 or x2 - 64 = 0, we could use the method of inspection. w Example Solve x2 = 36. To use inspection, we simply inspect the equation to look for perfect squares. We can easily get x by itself by square rooting both sides of the equation. Remem- ber, we have to account for a potential negative value of x, so don't forget the \u00b1 sign! x 2 =\u00b1 36 x = \u00b16 x = 6 and x = -6 are the two solutions to this equation. Practice 14. Solve x2 - 64 = 0. ____________ 15. Solve x2 + 40 = 45. ____________ Negative Numbers Last, consider the following equation. Solve x2 = -25. C an a number, when squared, ever be negative? No . A negative number when multiplied by a negative number is always positive. So, for this equation, there are no solutions. Real-World Context There are times when knowing how to solve qua-dratic equations helps us gure out real-life situa-tions. For instance, as a landscaper, if you were given instr uctions to lay stone tiles where the length would be twice as long as the width and your budget would pay for 72 square feet of tile, how would you gure out the dimensions of the tiled area? We know that when we nd the area of a rectangle, we get square units. Quadratic equations involve square units, so that is our clue that we can use the quadratic equation to nd w. (2w)(w) = 72 2w2 = 72 W e now have to gure out which method to use to solv e this equation: quadratic formula, completing the square, factoring, or inspection. Since we do not have a w term, completing the square and factoring can be ruled out. Do you notice that if we divided each side of the equation by 2, we would get a situa-tion where we have perfect squares? 2___ w2 ___ 72 2 = 2 w2 = 36 W e are perfectly set up to use the method of inspe ction. w 2 =\u00b1 36 w = \u00b16 w = 6 and w = -6 are solutions to this equation. How- ever, we are talking about dimensions of a tiled area, so it does not make sense to have negative numbers. Therefore, w = 6. I f the width is 6, we simply multiply that by 2 to ge t the length. Thus, the dimensions of the stone tiled area are go ing to be 12 feet by 6 feet. 4646 8 16. f(x) - - 4747 ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS Functions A function is a mathematical expression that states the relationship between an input and an output. Where do we see functions in real life? Everywhere! Any equation that allows you to substitute an input to get a corresponding output is a function. For instance, determining a distance when given a rate and a time is a function. How the area of a triangle changes as the base length changes is a function. Cal- culating your pay rate is a function. Even if the func- tion notation f(x) is not explicitly used, whenever we plug a value in to get a different value out, we are working with functions. Comparing Proportional Relationships When comparing proportional relationships, we look at the rate of change of each. The rate of change is simply the change in y values divided by the change )yin x values, ___ )x . For the equation of a line y = mx, m is the slope, or rate of change. To identify the rate of change for an equation of a line is easy: simply look at the value of m in the equation. 1For instance, for the equation y = __ 2 x, the rate of change is __ 1 2 . For the following table of values, we can )ynd the rate of change by using the formula ___ )x . x y 3 6 4 5 10 6 12 Divide the difference of any two y values by the dif- ference of their corresponding x values: ____ 8 - 6 24 - 3 = __ 1 = 2 Therefore, the rate of change, or the slope of the line if we were to graph it, is 2: y = 2x. 2 4 2 4 To nd the rate of change of a graph, we keep the )ysame formula in mind: ___ )x . We see that the line passes through the origin (0,0) as well as the point (2,4). W e can use these two points to determine the slope, or rate of change, by )ycalculating ___ )x : ____ 4 - 0 42 - 0 = __ 2 = 2 The rate of change of this line is 2.

These are x values. All the possible x values that can be substituted into a function make up the domain of the function. Outputs are the values that result from substi- tuting an input into the function. These are y values. All the possible y values that can result from a func- tion make up the range of a function. For every input (x), there is a corresponding output (y). Function notation for the output, or range, is f(x). Instead of writing it y = x2 - 1, it would be writ- ten f(x) = x2 - 1. The f(x) means that we will be sub- stituting x values into the function f to get output values, or the range. Example f(x) = 2x + 4 Find f(x), when x = -9. This can also be written \"Find f(-9).\" Substitute -9 for x into the equation: f(x) = 2(-9) + 4 f(x) = -18 + 4 f(x) = -14 Practice Given the following equation, ll in the chart for all values of f(x). f(x) = 3x3 - 12 x f(x) 1 3 5 7 Find the domain of the following function: ______ 3 + x2 9 - x2 = Evaluate the function = 2x2 + 3x when x = 2a. __________ Write a function to represent the following situation: Greg is paid an hourly rate as well as a com-mission for the number of refrigerators he sells in one day. He gets $13 per hour and works 8-hour days. For every refrigerator he sells, he gets $40. What function represents the amount of money Greg earns on a given day? ______________ Comparing Properties of Functions To compare properties of quadratic equations, it is rst important to know that quadratic equations, when graphed, are in the shape of a parabola. As you can see, it is a U-shaped curve. The parab - ola can be either facing up or facing down. If the parabola is facing up, as in Figure 1, there is a mini- mum y-coordinate. In this case, the minimum is 0. The function does not have a y value below that point. If the parabola is facing down, as in Figure 2, there is a maximum y-coordinate. In this case, the maximum is 4. The function does not have a y-coordinate above that point. 2 4 -2 -4 2 4 Figure 1 - - 4949 ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS 2 4 -2 -4 2 4 -2 Figure 2 Suppose we were given an algebraic expression of a quadratic equation and were asked to nd the maximum or minimum of that function. How would we do that? 1. Remember that the generic quadratic equation is ax2 + bx + c = 0. 2. If the value of a < 0, the function will yield a maximum value for y. The parabola will be fac-ing down. For example, f(x) = -4x2 + x - 3 has a = -4, which is less than 0. The parabola has a shape similar to the one in Figure 2. So, it has a maximum y-coordinate. How do we nd what the maximum y-coordinate is? Luckily, there is a procedure we can follow. The important thing to remember is that to nd where there is a maximum or a minimum, we need to nd -__ b 2a and then plug that value back into the equation. That might sound confusing, so let's walk through a couple of examples. Example f(x) = -4x2 + x - 3 1Plug 8 back into f(x) to maximum value of y: __ 1f -4( 8 )2 1 ) + ( __ 8 ) - 3 -2 = __ 1 8 + __ 8 - 3 -1 = __ 8 - 3 __ 1 = -3 8 -25f(x) = ___ 8 is the maximum value of this function. 3. If the value of a > 0, the function will yield a minimum value for y. The parabola will be fac-ing up. For example, f(x) = 2x2 - 3x + 4 has a value of a = 2, which is greater than 0. The parabola has a shape similar to the one in Figure 1. So, it has a minimum y-coordinate. How do we nd what the minimum y-coordinate is? Follow the same procedure as in the previous example. Again, the important thing to remember is that to nd where there is a maximum -bor a minimum, we need to nd __ 2a and then plug that value back into the equation: f(x) = 2x2 - 3x + 4 -__ b = ____ 3 2(2) = __ 4 __ 3Plug 4 back into f(x) nd maximum value of y: __ 3 3f( 4 ) = 2( __ 4 )2 3 - 3( __ 4 ) + 4 __ 9 9 = 2( 16) - ( __ 4 ) + 4 cross out the 2 by dividing the 16 by 2 in the rst term. This will avoid having to simplify it in the next step: 21. b. f(x) = -x2 + 5x 1.

How many negative numbers are m ultiplied in the numerator? Three. How many negative numbers are in the denominator? None. Since there is an odd number of negative signs, the answer will be negative. 2. 6. T aking the steps one by one: We have parentheses, (52 + 64). In the paren - theses we have a square root, so we need to sol ve that in order to add it to 52. The 64 = 8. 52 + 8 = 60. We have division: 60 \u00f7 10, which equals 6, so (52 + 64) \u00f7 10 = 6. It is important that the order of operations is followed to nd the right answer. 3. d. Or der of operations says that you should rst perform any operations in parentheses, and then perform all multiplication and division, moving from left to right; then perform all addition and subtraction, again moving from left to right. Start by simplifying the expressions inside both sets of parentheses, and in the second expres- sion, be sure to divide 4 by 2 before adding 4: (5 - 3) \u00d7 (4 + 4 \u00f7 2) = 2 \u00d7 (4 + 2) = 2 \u00d7 6 = 12 - - __ __ __ __ ___________ 4 ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS 4. 7. There are x's and y's in both the numeratorxy and denominator, so we can simplify. Again, we need to keep in mind our rule of dividing expo- nents. When simplifying x4 5, subtract the expo-x nent in the denominator from the exponent in the numerator to nd the remaining power of x: 4 - 5 = -1 S o, we are left with x-1. Since it is a negative exponent, the x will be in the denominator. When simplifying y 65, subtract the exponent iny the denominator from the exponent in the numerator to nd the remaining power of y: 5 - 6 = -1 S o, we are left with y-1, which means we also still have a y in the denominator. 7Our answer, then, is xy. 5. y2 - 4. Multiply Firsts: 2(y + 2)(y - 2) = y Multiply Outsides: (y + 2)(y - 2) = y2 - 2y Multiply Insides: (y + 2)(y - 2) = y 2 - 2y + 2y Multiply Lasts: (y + 2)(y - 2) = y2 - 2y + 2y - 4 When simplied, this expression is y2 - 4. Do you see how this is a difference of squares? Both y 2 and 4 are squares of numbers. 6. (y2 + 5)(y2 - 5). Notice that there are only two terms, not three. Ask yourself, could this be a difference of squares? Is y 4 the square of a number? Yes. (y2)(y2) = y Is 25 the square of a number? Yes. (5)(5) = 25 So, to write this expression in factored form, we write two binomials using the square roots, which we just found. One will be addition and one will be subtraction. The factored answer of y 4 - 25 = (y2 + 5)(y2 - 5). Again, let's check our answer by FOILing. Multiply Firsts: 4(y2 + 5)(y2 - 5) = y Multiply Outsides: 2(y2 + 5)(y2 - 5) = y4 - 2(y2 5)(y2 y4 5y2 + 5y Multiply Lasts: (y 2 + 5)(y2 - 5) = y4 - 5y2 + 5y2 - 25 Combine the like terms, -5y2 + 5y2, and we get zero. Thus, we are left with y4 - 25. It worked! 7. x = 2 and x = 1. F or an expression or function to be undened, the denominator must equal zero. In this case, we have a polynomial expres-sion in the denominator. To nd the values of x w here f(x) is undened, we must rst factor the polynomial. Refer to the rst example for step-by-step instructions of how to factor it. When factored, x 2 - 3x + 2 = (x - 2)(x - 1). So, f(x) = 3 (x - 2)(x - 1). What would make the denominator zero? If we m ultiply any number by zero the answer is zero. So, let's look at what would make each factor in our denominator zero. When would x - 2 = 0? When x = 2. When would x - 1 = 0? When x = 1. So, the two values of x where the function f(x) is undened are x = 2 and x = 1. 5454 - - _____ ____ ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS 8. 11. A gain, wherever we see an x, we need to replace it with the given value of -3. After sub-stituting, the equation reads: 2(-3) 2 + -3 - 4 Remember, PEMDAS. Exponents come rst. Which number is being squared? The parenthe-ses indicate that it is just the -3. What is (-3) 2? (-3)(-3) = +9. 2(9) + -3 - 4 M ultiplication comes next in the order of oper - ations. What is being multiplied? 2(9) = 18. 18 + -3 - 4 W e have only addition and subtraction left, so we now just solve the problem left to right. 18 + -3 - 4 15 - 4 = 11 9. 152. T o translate these words into symbols so we can solve the problem, we rst need to iden-tify the unknown. What is it that we are trying t o nd out? The number of T-shirts. This is what then becomes represented by a variable. So, let's say t is the number of T-shirts. We know that Richard needs to make at least $2,500. What do the words at least sound like? Could he make more? We're sure he'd love to! So, the words \"at least\" indicate that we have an inequality on our hands. The total amount Richard makes should be equal to or greater than $2,500. How do we calculate how much money Richard will make? He gets $16.50 per T-shirt sold. So, we are going to be multiplying $16.50 by our variable t, which represents the number of T-shirts, to get a product of $16.50t. Putting everything together, we now get the mathematical statement 2,500 f 16.50t. The inequality sign is pointing to 2,500 because Richard wants more than $2,500 if he can sell that many shirts! We solve this inequality just like we would if there were an equal sign. Divide both sides by 16.50 to undo 16.50Now, 16.50 = 1, so we now have t by itself on one side of the inequality. On the other side of the inequality, we can simplify and get 151.5. This number represents the number of T-shirts, so we need to round up to get a whole number, 152. Therefore, Richard needs to sell at least 152 T -shirts to make his goal of $2,500. Mathemati- cally, this is written 152 f t , as we hope the number of T-shirts, t, is greater than 152. How- ever, t needs to be at least equal to 152 for Rich- ard to make $2,500. 5555 - - __ ___ ____ __ __ __ ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS Divide each side by -5 now to isolate b.10. 12.5 or 12 1 2.

Substitute 40 for b in 2y + 0 = 25 the equation r + b = 130: Next, divide each side of the equation by 2 to r + b = 130 isolate y. r + 40 = 130 2y 25 Subtract 40 from each side to get r by itself.= 2 2 r + 40 = 130y = 12.5 or 12 21. -40 -4011. Edward sold 40 $5 blue tickets and 90 $10 red r = 90 tickets. W e need to use a system of equations to Therefore, 40 $5 blue tickets were sold and 90 solve this problem. We know that Edward sold $10 red tickets were sold. 130 red and blue tickets combined. Let's use r 12. y > 3.

However, let's use the 13. method of substitution. If we use the rst equation to isolate r, we need to subtract b from both sides of the equation: We need to show that for the inequality y + r + b = 130 4 > 7, we can have a value of y that is greater -b -b than 3. To do this, we plot an open circle at 3 r = 130 - b (y cannot equal 3 according to this number Now, we can substitute 130 - b for r in the sec- statement) and then draw an arrow extend- ond equation. ing to the right of 3. 10r + 5b = 1,100 10(130 - b) + 5b = 1,100 Distribute 10 to each of the terms in parentheses. 1,300 - 10b + 5b = 1,100 Combine the b's and the numbers, each on one side of the equation. 1,300 - 10b + 5b = 1,100 -1,300 -1,300 -5b = -200 6 54 32 1 0 5656 - - ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS 14. x = 8 and -8.

B y plugging the values from the table into each of the equations, it is clear that -3x2 + 4 is the only equation that satises the relationships between the inputs and outputs. Without even substituting all of the inputs to check the outputs, the input 0 makes it obvious that d is the only function that satises the relationship. 17. x f(x) 1 -9 3 69 5 363 7 1,017 To nd the output values, we need to substitute our inputs into the function f(x). f (x) = 3x3 - 12 f(1) = 3(1)3 - 12 = 3 - 12 = -9 f(3) = 3(3)3 - 12 = 3(27) - 12 = 81 - 12 = 69 f(5) = 3(5) 3 - 12 = 3(125) - 12 = 375 - 12 = 363 f(7) = 3(7)x 3 - 12 = 3(343) - 12 = 1,029 - 12 = 1,017 Notice that f(x) is the y-coordinate. These p oints could be plotted on a graph to see this portion of the function. 5757 - x | 3, -3. What is the domain again? The set of inputs. The x values. We need to know what x values can be substituted into this equation to yield an output of f(x). For many functions, there are no restrictions. For instance, for f(x) = x 2, we can plug in any value we want and we will get an output for f(x). However, for the function in this problem, we have to pay special attention to the fact that it is a fraction. What do we know about fractions? The denom- inator can never be 0. So, we need to nd which v alue(s) of x will result in 0 in the denominator. To do this, set the current denominator equal to 0. 9 - x 2 = 0 Solve for x by rst moving the x2 to the other side of the equation. 9 - x2 = 0 + x2 + x2 29 = x Now, take the square root of both sides: 9 = x 2 \u00b13 = x 23 + xTherefore, the function f(x) = 2 has a9 - x domain where x | 3,-3. 19. 2(4a2 + 3a). Just like the previous problems, we substitute the x value, or input, to get the value of f(x), or the output: f(x) = + 6a = 2(4a2 + 3a) The last step of the solution reflects the un-dist ribution of a 2. 20. M = 104 + 40n (variables will vary). Let's use M for the total amount of money Greg earns on a given day. We know for sure that he gets paid $13 per hour and that he works 8 hours per day. So far, M = (13)(8) In addition, though, Greg gets a $40 commis- sion for every refrigerator he sells. Let's let n stand f or the number of refrigerators Greg sells. This probably changes from day to day. When we put this into the equation, we multiply it by $40, since Greg gets $40 for each refrigerator he sells. M = (13)(8) + 40n Simplied, the function is M = 104 + 40n T his is a function because the value M will change depending on the value, n, that is substi- tuted into the equation. Each input n will yield a diff erent output, M. 21. b. F or function A, we can see that the maxi-mum value is f(x) = 2. F or function B, we need to do a little more work.

T his problem requires us to use the distribu- tive property for two parts of the expression. Fir st, we need to distribute 7 to each of the fac- tors in the quantity after it: x , 2y, and -3. This gives us 7x + 14y - 21. Next, we need to distrib- ute the -3 to each of the terms in the quantity aft er it: 2x, -4 y, and 1. This gives us -6x + 12y - 3. Now, we need to combine like terms to sim-plify the expression: 7x + 14y - 21 - 6x + 12y - 3 = x + 26y - 24. Choice a did not distribute the negative with the 3 in the second half of the problem. Choice b reflects incorrectly distribut-ing the coefcients and negatives to the other t erms. Choice d did not distribute the coef- cient to each term. 2. d. I n order to nd out how many flyers Johanna and Paolo passed out, we need to sub- tract x, the amount left over, from the total, 1,000. Once we get that value, we multiply by 15% by changing 15% to a decimal, 0.15. Multi-ply 0.15 by (1,000 - x ) to get the number of new customers they will anticipate. Choices a and b do not convert the percentage to an equivalent decimal before multiplying. In addition, choice b multiplies the total number of flyers by the amount left over instead of subtracting it. Choice c reflects a lack of understanding of how to calculate the anticipated response rate. 3. a. L ooking at the answer options, we can 2deduce that we need to factor 2y2 - yp - p. Keeping in mind how to FOIL backwards, we get the two factors (2y + p)(y - p). When these two binomials are multiplied, or FOILed, we get the original expression. Choice b does not have the necessary factor of 2 to get 2y 2. Choice c incorrectly factors out a 2 from the rst term only. Choice c has the addition and subtraction signs incorrectly placed. The way d is written, we would get +yp instead of -yp when multi- plied out. 4. d. S ince we know that Aaron needs three times as much cheese as ranch dressing, we know that the 48 ounces of cheese are three times the needed ranch dressing. Either multiply 48 by 1 3 or divide 48 by 3. They are essentially doing the same thing. The answer is 16 ounces of ranch. Choice a multiplies 48 by 3 instead of dividing 48 by 3. Choices b and c are factors of 48 and demonstrate a lack of understanding of how to calculate the answer to the problem. 5. $225. A sy stem of equations is needed to solve this problem. If C = the amount of money the club prots and D = the amount of money donated, the following two equations are true: C + D = 550 C - 100 = D When C - 100 is substituted into the rst equa- tion for D, the equation reads C + C - 100 = 550. 2 C - 100 = 550 2C = 650 C = 325 When this value is substituted for C in the sec-ond equation, the equation reads 325 - 100 = 225. 5959 - - ______ __ ALGEBRA AND FUNCTIONS 6. c. T he number of bottles of product purchased is multiplied by the cost of the each bottle. This product is set less than or equal to $2,000, which is the total amount Richard is able to spend. Solving for p will yield the number of bottles that can be purchased without going over his $2,000 budget. Choice a is incorrect because it indicates that Richard would be able to spend any amount equal to or greater than $2,000. Choice b is incorrect because it does not take into account that (1) the cost needs to be multiplied by the number of bottles purchased and (2) the amount Richard is able to spend can equal $2,000. Choice d is incorrect because it indicates that the cost of one of the bottles of product should be divided by the number of bottles; however, the cost should be multiplied by the number of bottles of product to yield the price of the total purchase. 7. b. T his is a quadratic equation and can be solved in several ways: factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. How-ever, looking at the terms -5x and -6, it is ap parent that factors of 6 can add to 5, so we will factor this quadratic to get the solutions. First, we set the equation equal to 0: x 2 - 5x + 6 = 0. We want to nd the two values of x where the equation is equal to 0. By factor - ing, we get (x - 2)(x - 3). Multiply it out if nec- essary to check that it in fact yields the original e quation. Anything multiplied by 0 is 0, so for what values of x would we get an answer of 0? When x = 2 and when x = 3. Choices a, c, and d have incorrectly placed positive and negative signs. 8. b. T he party host must buy three balloons for each guest, so 3g represents the correct number of balloons for all the guests. The host must also buy 20 more balloons for the hall, so the total number of balloons is the number needed for the guests plus 20 more. This is the equation b = 3g + 20. 9. d. T his answer is equivalent to the original because each of the terms was divided by 4, and then accurately written as a product of 4 and the quantity 8x 2 + x - 2. This, in effect, is the un-distribution of a 4 from each term. Choices a and b incorrectly factor out 32 and 4x, respec- tively, which leaves the remaining terms incor - rect. Choice c looks very similar to choice d, but the 4 is not c orrectly factored out of the term 232x. 10.

To factor means to divide out the largest fac- t or that all of the terms have in common. First, consider the coefcients: 5 is a factor of both coefcients, so divide the 5 out. Next, consider the variable x: x3 is a factor of both terms, so divide out the x3. Finally, consider the variable y: The second term has y raised to only the rst power, so y is the largest factor. After determining the largest factor, rewrite the expression by dividing each term by the factor: 35xy(2xy5 - 1) 14. 17. Let x equal the number sought. The word p roduct tells us to multiply 16 by one-half x, or (16)(0.5x), which we set equal to 136. There-fore, (16)(0.5 x) = 136, which reduces to 8x = 136, res ulting in x = 17. 15. d.

Circle Graphs/Pie Charts Circle graphs, or pie charts, are used to express data that collectively makes a whole. This is best used when looking at percentages out of 100%. It's good for getting a comparison of a particular piece of information against the whole. For instance, if 80% of all children in developing countries under the age of ve are malnourished, a circle graph could easily display this data. Number of Books The 80% of malnourished children under ve years old in developing countries plus the 20% of nour - ished children under ve years old in developing count ries equals a whole 100% of children under ve years old in developing countries. The circle graph provides a visual representation of the statistics. On the test, you may have to identify the correct piec e of the circle to complete a graph, similar to the bar graph example. Or you may have to nd percent-ages of data to correctly construct the circle graph, or at least re cognize the correct graph. 6565 Single-Mother Families 84.1% Single- Father Families 15.9% 3. - - GRAPHS AND TABLES Practice c.

Two scores were 84, so two X's stacked on top of each other are plotted at 84. Three scores were 92, so three X's are plotted at 92. Last, one score was 94, so one X is plotted at 94. This visualization of data allows Miss Betty to quickly see the range of test scores: 79 to 94. It also gives her a visualization of how well her students are doing as a whole. On the GED\u00ae test, you will be asked to interpret information of dot plots as well as use them to nd missing information.

For instance, suppose Miss Betty has 25 students, and she wants a good way to summarize the score data of the recent test. The scores are already listed in chronolog-ical order. If data is given that is not list ed from least to greatest, you must order the data before proceeding with the box plot. 25 Scores from Miss Betty's Class Test 55, 65, 67, 69, 75, 76, 78, 79, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 87, 89, 90, 91, 91, 91, 92, 93, 93, 93, 100 Even though there are 25 numbers in the data set, be cause a box plot offers a summary of the data, only ve numbers will be plotted: 1. Median of the entire data set 2. Lower quartile (i.e., the median of the lower half o f the data set) 3. Upper quartile (i.e., the median of the upper half o f the data set) 4. Lower extreme (i.e., the lowest point of the data set) 5. U pper extreme (i.e., the highest point of the data set) S o, how do we nd these ve numbers? Let's start with the median of the entire data set. Look at the chronological list of data. What is the very middle number (i.e., the median)? 55, 65, 67, 69, 75, 76, 78, 79, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 87, 89, 90, 91, 91, 91, 92, 93, 93, 93, 100 The number 86 is the median because there is an even 12 numb ers on each side of it in the data set. Next, let's nd the lower quartile, the median of the low er half of the data set. The rst 12 values are: 55, 65, 67, 69, 75, 76, 78, 79, 82, 83, 84, 85. . . . There is an even number of data points, so we need to nd the average of the two middle numbers to get our lower quartile: 76 + 78= 77 The number 77 is the lower quartile, the median of the lower half of the data set. To nd the upper quartile, nd the median of the upp er half of the data set: . . . 87, 87, 89, 90, 91, 91, 91, 92, 93, 93, 93, 100 Again, there are 12 numbers, but the two middle numb ers are the same, so it is easy to take the average of them to get the upper quartile: 91 + 91______ 2 = 91 The number 91 is the upper quartile, the median of the upper half of the data set. 6868 - - GRAPHS AND TABLES The lower and upper extremes are easy to nd. They are simply the lowest number and the highest number in the data set\u2014in this case, 55 and 100. Now that we have our ve points, let's plot them on the n umber line. Lower extreme: 55 Lower quartile: 77 M edian: 86 Upper quartile: 91 U pper extreme: 100 The bolded numbers are going to become lines to ma ke a box. The extremes are simply going to be dots. 50 60 70 80 90 100 Do you see how the box contains three vertical lines? These represent the values of 77, 86, and 91. The box lets Miss Betty see that the majority of her students fall within the range of the boxed values. The points let Miss Betty see the outliers of data\u2014how far above and below her students scored with respect to the box. Remember, the box has been made according to Q1 three median values of the data set. Looking at the box plot, Miss Betty can also see that the lower half of her class's scores are more spread out and the upper half of her class's scores are more bunched. The last terminology you should know for box plots involves quartiles. The data is split up into four quartiles, as shown: Q2 Q3 Q4 50 60 70 80 100 6969 Mr. Duvall's College Students Number of Students12 9 6 3 41-45 46-50 51-55 56-60 Age of Students Minnesota 45 50 55 60 65 70 Alaska A.

According to the graph, what is the percentage diffe rence between the age group with the highest number of students and the age group with the lowest number of students? _______ Scatter Plots Scatter plots of bivariate data\u2014data with two vari- ables\u2014allow us to assess the relationship between the two variables and make predictions about data not contained in the graph. Here are some terms to know with respect to scatter plots: C luster: A cluster of points is where most of the plott ed points are located. It can also refer to the direction of the plotted points as a whole. Outlier: This is a point that is not with the clus- t er. It is either signicantly larger or smalle r or a point that does not correlate with the rest of the data. Linear association: A g raph has linear associa- tion if the plotted points resemble a line. Nonlinear association: A g raph has nonlinear association if the plotted points resemble a curve. Positive association: Posit ive association of bivariate data means that as one variable increases, the other increases as well. Negative association: Ne gative association of bivariate data means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. Creating a Scatter Plot Here is a table of bivariate data: the number of hours ea ch student studied each week compared to the number of weeks it took each to pass his or her GED\u00ae test. hoURS oF STUDyinG nUMbeR oF weekS To pa SS GeD 30 25 24 21 19 10 27 11 17 12 16 14 14 17 13 20 10 To graph this data, treat one variable as the x-coordi - nate and the other variable as the y-c oordinate. There are 11 (x,y) coordinates for this collected data. When plotting points, there are six things to keep in mind: 1. The x-axis is horizontal. 2. The y-axis is vertical. 3. The x-coordinate is always the rst term listed in the pare ntheses (x,y). 4. The y-coordinate is always the second term liste d in the parentheses (x,y). 5. The point of intersection between the x- and y-axis is cal led the origin. It has an x value of 0 and a y value of 0. It is written (0,0). 6. There are four different quadrants that make up the co ordinate plane. As you can see from the following graph, any y value below the x-axis is negative. Any x value to the left of the y-axis is also negative. 7171 - - 72GRAPHS AND TABLES 72 x y (x,y) (-x ,y) (-x ,-y) (x,-y) To plot the point (4,-5), you would start at the origin and move four spaces to the right and ve spaces down. -5 4 y xOrigin To plot the point (-3,6), you would start at the origin and move three spaces to the left and six spaces up. 6 -3 y x Origin If we refer back to the data just listed and plot these points as (x,y) coordinates, the result would look like this: Number of Study Hours Number of Weeks to Pass GED\u00ae Test35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Hours of Studying per Week vs. Number of We eks to Pass the GED \u00ae Test 0 5 10 15 20 25 - - GRAPHS AND TABLES a. b. c. d. It might be helpful at this point for you to return to Chapter 2 on algebra and functions to reread the information on slope: what it is, how to nd it, and what it represents.

The data shows negative nonlinear associat ion. d. One can quite condently predict that a stud ent who studies 19 hours a week will pass the GED\u00ae test in roughly 11 weeks. Graphs in the Real World In addition to knowing how to answer questions on the GED\u00ae test, understanding how graphs are con-structed and convey meaning is extremely important fo r job skills and in further education. Displaying data graphically can offer powerful evidence to sup-port claims. For instance, one could use the data from the bar graph to support the claim that changes in society over the past 100 years have resulted in a decrease in the number of children per family. The data represented in the circle graph could be used to argue that single mothers need more nancial and educational support. The data from the box plot shows Miss Betty that the majority of her students are succeeding as well as illustrates that there are a few students who may need extra help. Mr. Duvall can use the histogram to recruit other middle-aged adults who may be wary of starting college at their age. The scatter plot can encourage students to study more so that they pass their GED\u00ae test faster. parallel and p erpendicular l ines Two lines are parallel if they have the same slope. For instance, y = 7x + 5 and y = 7x - 34 are parallel. The slope of each line is 7. Two lines are perpendicular if their slopes are opposite reciprocals. For instance, if the slope of a line __ 1A is 2, then the slope of its perpendicular line B is - 2. A n innite number of lines could be parallel and pe rpendicular to a given line when you look only at the slope as the determining factor. The only thing that changes with each of these lines is the y-inter- cept\u2014where it crosses the y-axis. However, what if we wanted to nd a par ticular line that is parallel or perpendicular to a given line? As long as we know the slope and a point through which the line passes, we can nd a particular parallel or perpendicular line. Example Find the equation of the line that is parallel to 3y - 6 = 18 x and passes through the point (0,-3). First, we need to get the given line into slope- inte rcept form: y = = 18x +6 +6 + 3= 3+ 6 y = 6x + 2 7373 12. a. b. c. d. - - GRAPHS AND TABLES Our slope is 6, so the slope of the parallel line is also 6.

Find the equation of the line that is perpendic- __1ular to y =4 x + 6 that passes through the point (-2,8). ____________ key Features of Graphs There are many features of graphs that are used to describe and identify functions. Intercepts There are x-intercepts and y-intercepts, which are points at which the graph line intersects an axis. As you would imagine, x-intercepts intercept, or cross over, the x-axis, and y-intercepts intercept, or cross over, the y-axis. Look at the following graph of y = x + 4. y 6 2 -2 2 -2 4 -4 x At which point does the line cross the x-axis? (-4,0) The x-int ercept of this function is -4. What do you notice about the y value? It is 0. Does this make sense? If a function crosses the x-axis, then at that exact point there is no height\u2014upward or downward movement\u2014of the function. Therefore, the y value must be 0. At which point does the line cross the y-axis? (0,4) The y-int ercept is 4. What do you notice about the x value? It is 0. Does this make sense? If a function 7474 15. 16. - - 7575 GRAPHS AND TABLES crosses the y-axis at that exact point, there is no width\u2014left or right movement\u2014of the function. Therefore, the value of x must be 0. Sometimes functions have more than one x-intercept and/or y-intercept. Look at the following graph. 2 -2 2 4 -2 y x How many y-intercepts does this parabola have? One: When x = 0, y = 4. How many x-intercepts does this parabola have? Two: When y = 0, x = 2 and -2. If you did not have a graph to look at, could you nd values of the x- and/or y-intercept(s)? Since we know that at the point of intersection the other coordinate value is 0, we can determine what the intercept values are when we have an equation. We have already started practicing this concept with the equation of a line, y = mx + b, where b is the y-intercept. Practice What is the y-intercept of the function f(x) = 3x + 4? ____________ Where does the function f(x) = 5x2 - 25 inter- sect the x-axis? _______________ Increasing and Decreasing A way to think about the concept of increasing and decreasing intervals is to observe whether the graph is rising or falling from left to right. A function is said to be increasing during intervals over which the graph rises from left to right. Conversely, a function is said to be decreasing during intervals over which the graph falls from left to right. The points at which a function changes from increasing to decreasing or from decreasing to increasing are points on the graph where the function is said to be neither increasing nor decreasing. Intervals during which the function increases are described as having a non-negative slope. Inter- vals during which the function decreases are described as having a non-positive slope. For instance, the function graphed next is increasing from before we even see the graph (from negative x values) all the way to the y value of 4. Since it appears this graph goes on forever, we use the symbol to represent inn- ity. So, the interval over which this function increases and has a non-negative slope is (-h,0). 2 2 4 -2 -2 y x - - 76GRAPHS AND TABLES 76 Where does this same function decrease? From 0 to what appears to be innity. The interval over which the function is decreasing and has a non-positive slope is written (0,h). It is very important to use parentheses ( ) instead of brackets [ ] because 0 is not included in either the increasing or decreasing\u2014it is simply the x value at which the function switches direction\u2014and innity is not a nite amount. Brack- ets indicate that the value is included in the interval. Let's look at another function to illustrate the increasing and decreasing of functions. 2 -2 -2 -4 -6 -8 -10 y x Over which interval(s) is the f(x) increasing? Over which interval(s) is the f(x) decreasing? There are no intervals where f(x) is increasing. There is a point when the function intersects the y-axis where it is neither increasing nor decreasing: (0,-5). With the exception of this point where the graph is neither rising nor falling, the graph main- tains a non-positive slope (i.e., the graph falls from left to right). Since we have an interval where the function decreases, and then the point (0,-5), and then another interval where the function decreases, we write the two decreasing intervals joined with a \u008b to illustrate this concept. The function f(x) decreases (-h,0) \u008b (0,h). Positive and Negative Functions are considered positive or negative based on the y values. That is, we can tell during which interval(s) the function is positive or negative by looking for portions of the graph that are above or below the x-axis. Any part of the function above the x-axis means the y value is positive. Any part of the function below the x-axis means the y value is negative. 1 3 3 5 7 9 -7 -5 -3 y x -3 -1 -5 -7 5 7 9 -9 This function is positive on the intervals (h,-7) \u008b (5,h) and is negative on the interval (-7,5). Relative Maximums and Minimums Maximums are heights of the function, and mini- mums are lows of the function. Maximums and min- imums occur where there are changes in the direction of the graph. When a function increases and then decreases, a maximum occurs. When a function decreases and then increases, a minimum occurs. There may be several maximums and minimums of a - - 7777 GRAPHS AND TABLES function\u2014thus, the term relative, which refers to the region of the graph where a given maximum or mini- mum is located. Take a look at this graph: (-5, 2) 12 10 8 6 4 2 -2 -4 -6 -8 -10 5 10 1 5 20 -20 -15 -10 -5 (9, -8) (-5,2) (9,-8) f(x) 0 At what point does the function f(x) have a maximum? The graph switches from decreasing to increas- ing at the point (9,-8), making it a relative minimum value. At what point does the function f(x) have a maximum? The graph switches from increasing to decreas- ing at the point (-5,2), making it a relative maximum value. Symmetries Some graphs are symmetrical about the x-axis or y-axis. Creating symmetry is like looking in a mirror. If you were given half of the information of a sym- metrical function, you would be able to complete the graph. For instance, look at this graph: 2 4 If this function is symmetrical about the x-axis, you can mirror the relationship and sketch the rest of the graph. 2 4 6 8 10 2 4 -2 -4 n 2 -2 2 4 -2 - - 78GRAPHS AND TABLES 78 Consider this next graph: 2 4 4 6 -2 -4 2 If you were told it is symmetrical about the y-axis, how would you complete the graph? 2 4 -2 -4 6 2 4 -2 -4 End Behavior End behavior refers to what the function is doing as the y values approach \u00b1h. If you look at a graph, it is easy to tell what is happening to the y values as the x values change. However, what if you do not have a graph in front of you, but rather have only a func- tional formula? There are a few things to keep in mind: If the function has an even leading power (i.e., x2 , x4 , x6, etc.), then the function will have a parabolic shape. If the leading coefcient is positive, the parabola will be face up; if the leading coefcient is negative, it will be face down. When there is a positive leading coefficient, as x approaches negative infinity (written x q -h), y approaches positive infinity (written f(x) q h). In addition, as x q +h +, f( x) q h. When there is a negative leading coef- ficient, as x q h, f(x) q h. In addition, as x q +h, f(x) q -h. noTe n 17. 18. - - 7979 GRAPHS AND TABLES If the function has an odd leading power (i.e., x3 , x5 , x7, etc.), then the function will have a cubic shape. If the leading coefcient is positive, the function will start from the bottom left of the graph; if the leading coefcient is negative, the function will start from the upper left of the graph. 2 -2 2 4 6 -2 -4 2 -2 -2 -4 -6 -8 -10 When there is a positive leading coefficient, as x q -h, f(x) q -h.

In addition, as x q +h, f(x) q -h. noTe Practice What is the end behavior of the function x4 + 3x3 - 2x as x q -h? _____________ What is the end behavior of the function -2x 5 + 3x3 + x2 as x q +h? _____________ Equation of a Line As we've covered before, the equation of any line is y = mx + b. The variables x and y represent any (x,y) coordinate on the line. The variable m represents the slope, and the variable b represents the y-intercept. Imagine drawing a line. You could go on forever if you didn't have walls, doors, street signs, trees, and so forth in the way. Lines are innite. Thus, they have an innite number of points on them. The equation of a distinct line will have a denite slope and a de- nite y-intercept named in the equation, but the vari- ables x and y will remain in the general equation. The following are examples of equations of distinct lines. Any (x,y) coordinates that satisfy this relationship are located on the given line. y = 8x + 6 y = -3x + 2 __ 1y = 2 x - 3 However, what if we don't know the equation of a certain line, but we have other information about it? Can we still gure out what line it is? Yes! As long as we have either a given point and a given slope or two distinct points, we can identify a specic line. 20. - - GRAPHS AND TABLES Given Slope, Given Point If we know the slope and a point (x,y), that takes care of three of the four variables in the equation y = mx + b. We can solve for the unknown, b, and then rewrite the equation with the value of b. Example Find the equation of the line that has a slope of 4 and passes throug h the point (-1,7). Substitute the known values into the equation y = mx + b and solve for b: y = mx + b 7 = 4(-1) + b 7 = -4 + b +4 +4 11 = b Now, include the value of b in the equation and write it so that x and y are back in the equation: y = 4x + 11 Practice 19. Find the equation of the line that passes through (9,-5) and has a slope of 0.5. ________________ Two Given Points W e can also nd the equation of a specic line if we hav e two distinct points on the line, even if we don't have the slope. This method has several steps to remember. Let's say we want to know the equation of the line that passes throug h (2,0) and (-3,5). Step 1: Use the equation y - y1 = m(x - x1) to nd the slope. I f it helps to keep the points straight, you can labe l the points (it doesn't matter which point you choose to have a subscript, as long as you are consis-tent): (2,0) (x,y) (-3,5) (x1,y1) N ow, plug these values into the equation and solve fo r slope, m. y - y1 = m(x - x1) 0 - 5 = m(2 - (-3)) -5 = m(2 + 3) -5__ m ____ (5)= 5 5 -1 = m Step 2: Now that we know the slope is -1, we can nd the equation of the line by using the same equation and one of the points\u2014either one\u2014to substitute for (x1,y1). y - 5 = -1(x - (-3)) y - 5 = -1(x + 3) y - 5 = -x - 3 +5 +5 y = -x + 2 Practice W hat is the equation of the line that passes throug h (-6,3) and (-1,11)? ___________ Graphing a Linear Equation Graphing a linear equation is quite simple. 1. If you are given two distinct points, simply plot both p oints and draw a line through them. 2.

However, when you have an even number of data points, there are two middle numbers. The median is then the average of those two middle numbers. To nd the missing score, we rst need to order the data points from least to greatest: 79, 84, 84, 92, 92, 92, 94 T he problem states that the missing point in the data set is between 84 and 92.

In the rst example, we calculated 39 total students. Reading the graph, we can see that the number of students ages 46 to 50 is 12. To nd the percentage, we simply divide 12 by 39 and then move the decimal point two spaces to the right. 12 39 = 0.307 = 30.7 = 31% (when rounded) So, 31% of Mr. Duvall's students are ages 46 to 50. 8. 13%. W e found the percentage of the age group with the highest number of students in the sec- ond example. Next, we need to nd the percent- age of students in the age group with the lowest n umber of students. The lowest number of stu- dents in an age group is 7, in the 56 to 60 age r ange. Find the percentage by dividing 7 by the total number of students, and then move the decimal place. 7 39 = 0.179 = 17.9 = 18% (when rounded) The percentage difference is then 31% -18% 13% S o, the percentage difference between the age groups with the highest number of students and the lowest number of students in Mr. Duvall's class is 13%. 9. negative association. Look back at the six t erms dened earlier. Negative association means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. In this graph, as the number of hours of studying increases, the amount of time it takes to pass the GED\u00ae test decreases. 10. c.

There must be other reasons that this student did not pass his or her GED\u00ae test in fewer weeks, because it does not follow the trend. 11. c. T he graph does show a linear association, so choice c is not true. The graph has a negative association: as the number of hours of studying increases, the number of weeks it takes to pass the GED\u00ae test decreases. Since the graph does have a linear association, one can predict values not plotted that follow the linear progression. 12. b. T he slope of the given line is 3, and the slope of the line in option b is also 3. Parallel lines have the same slope. Choices a and c mistakenly use the y-intercept value of 2, and choice d has a slope that renders it perpendicular to the given line. __ __ __ __ ___ GRAPHS AND TABLES 13. d. T o accurately identify the slope of a line per - pendicular to the given one when the x term is o n the other side of the equation, manipulate the equation to put it in y = mx + b form. y + 43x = 1 3 3-4 x -4 x -3y =4 x + 1 -3The slope is 4 , so the perpendicular slope must be the opposite reciprocal\u2014a positive 34. Choices b and c confuse the y-intercept term for the slope. Choice a has the wrong sign because the x term was not moved to the other side of the equation before identifying the slope. An innite number of lines could be parallel and perpendicular to a given line when we look only at the slope as the determining factor. The only thing that changes with each of these lines is the y-intercept\u2014where it crosses the y-axis. 14. y = -4x. If the slope of the given line is __ 41, what is the slope of any line perpendicular to it? The opposite reciprocal: -4. Now that we have iden- tied the slope, let's substitute the given x and y v alues into the slope-intercept equation to nd the y-intercept of this particular line: y = mx + b 8 = -4(-2) + b 8 = 8 + b -8 -8 0 = b The equation of the line perpendicular to y = 41x + 6 that passes through (-2,8) is y = -4x + 0, or just y = -4x. 15. 4. Since we know that the y-intercept is located o n the y-axis (and therefore x = 0), let's substi- tute 0 in for x and see what y value we get. R emember, f(x) and y represent the same thing. f(x) = 3x + 4 f (x) = 3(0) + 4 f(x) = 4 16. x = 5. Since we know that the x-intercept is located on the x-axis, and therefore y = 0, let's substitute 0 for y and see what x value we get. f(x) = 5x2 - 25 0 = 5x2 - 25 +25 +25 225 = 5x 25__ 5x2 = 5 5 25 = x 5= x 2 \u00b1 5 = x Since we have to take into account values when square rooting, there are two places where the function f(x) = 5x 2 - 25 intercepts the x-axis. 17. as x q -h, f(x) q +h.

Therefore, it will behave like a cubic function with a negative coefcient, like the example shown above. The function will generally decrease from the left of the graph to the right of the graph. As x q +h, f(x) q -h. 19. y = 0.5x - 9.5.

Each quartile accounts for 25% of the data. Since there are four quartiles in a data set, the middle two quartiles (the second and third quartiles) repre- sent the middle 50% of the data. For this data set, the beginning of the second q uartile is $50 and the end of the third quartile is $90. So, the middle 50% of the data is between $50 and $90. 9191 - - GRAPHS AND TABLES 5. d.

When looking at a scatter plot of data points, a correlation exists if there is a relation- ship between x and y that holds true for the majo rity of the points. For example, if the y val- ues get larger as the x values get larger, there is a p ositive correlation. In other words, if the points seem to rise as you move from left to right on the graph, there is a positive correla-tion. Similarly, if the y values get smaller as the x values get larger, there is a negative correla- tion; the values are behaving in an opposite way t o each other. According to this scatter plot, there is a distinct relationship. As the x values get larger, so do the y values. Therefore, there is a positive correlation. Consider the line. Does the line cut the rectan-gle in half and form two mirror images? Y es; this line divides the rectangle into two tri- angles that are mirror images of each other. 6. 9%.

This concept is similar to nding the perimeter of a straight-sided gure. However, since a circle does not have any straight sides, the dis- tance around the circle\u2014the circumference\u2014needs to be calculated differently. What is the circumference of the following circle if AB = 4 cm? Before you can calculate the circumference of a circle, there are a few terms you need to know. A B C A D Center: In the gure, the center is at point A. Radius: Any line that is drawn from the center, A, to the outside of the circle is called a radius. Thus, the line from A to D, AD, is a radius, and the distance from A to C, CA, is a radius. There- fore, AD = CA. Diameter: Any line that is drawn from one end of the circle to the other end and passes through the center of the circle is called a diam- eter. Thus, the line is a diameter because it passes through the center of the circle, A. Notice that CA + AD = CD. The length of the diameter of a circle is equivalent to two times the radius: d = 2r. U (pi\u2014sounds like \"pie\") . .

If the circumference of the circle is 62.8 mm, what is the diameter of CD? ____________ area Whereas the perimeter refers to the measurement around a gure, area refers to the measurement inside a gure. In general, to nd the area of gures such as rectangles, squares, triangles, and circles, you will use multiplication.

The formulas for calculating the volume of a rectangular prism, right prism, cylinder, right pyramid, cone, and sphere will be available to you during the GED\u00ae test. You do not need to memorize the formulas; just become com-fortable with using them. Rectangular/Right Prisms To nd the volume of a rectangular prism, or right prism, use the following formula: V = Bh, where B is the area of the base (length \u00d7 width) and h is the height. Notice that the only difference between the area of a rectangle and the volume of a rectangular prism is the addition of a dimension of height. Pay close attention to the units of volume in this section. They are cubed, not squared, reflecting the addition of a dimension. Example If the height of the prism is 3 cm and the length of the prism is 8 cm, what is the width in cm if the vol- ume is 96 cm3? Fir st, write the formula for the volume of a rect- angular prism. Then, substitute for known values. V = Bh 96 cm3 = (8 cm)(3 cm)w 4 cm = w Practice 11. These two boxes have the same volume (V = l \u00d7 w \u00d7 h). Find the length of the missing side on box B. 4 cm 3 cm 4 cm Box A 3 4 5 Cylinders To nd the volume of a cylinder, use the formula V = Ur2h. Notice that the only difference between the area of a circle and the volume of a cylinder is the addition of the dimension of height. Again, this addition of a 9898 - - GEOMETRY BASICS term to multiply in the equation will change the units from squared units to cubic units. Practice 12.

Example Let's nd the height of this pyramid if the volume is 54 mm3. 6 mm3 mm We know the volume is 54 mm3. We can nd B by multiplying the length \u00d7 width of the rectangular base: B = (6 mm)(3 mm) = 18 mm2 Return to the formula and substitute the known val- ues to nd the height: 1V = mm2)(h) 162 mm3 = (18 mm2)h 9 mm = h Right Circular Cones To nd the volume of a right circular cone, use the = __ 1formula V3 Ur2h.

Round y our answ er to the nearest tenth of a centimeter . ________________ 9999 - - GEOMETRY BASICS Spheres To nd the volume of a sphere , use the formula V = __ 4 3 Ur3 . Example L et's nd the volume of this sphere if the diameter is 11 inches. The diameter of 11 inches informs us that the radius is half of 11 inches; the radius is, therefore, 5.5 inches. Substitute this value back into the formula to nd the volume of the sphere: V__ 4 = 3 Ur3 V__ (522.4175 in.3) = 696.5566 in.3 surface a rea Surface area refers to the area of the entire outside of a three-dimensional gure. The formulas for calcu- lating the surface area of a rectangular prism, right pr ism, cylinder, right pyramid, cone, and sphere will be available to you during the test. You do not need to memorize the formulas; just become comfortable with using them. Rectangular/Right Prisms The formula for calculating the surface area of a rect-angular, or right, prism is SA = ph +2B where B is the area of the base, p is the perimeter of base B, and h is the height. Example Let's calculate the surface area of this gure. 8 in. 4 in. 3 in. There are three unknown values you need to nd in order to solve for the surface area: p, h, and B. p = the p erimeter of the base = 8 in. + 8 in. + 3 in. + 3 in. = 22 in. h = the height of the prism = 4 in. B = the area of the base = (8 in.)(3 in.) = 24 in.2 Substitute these values into the formula to get SA = (22 in.)(4 in.) + 2(24 in.2) = 88 in.2 + 48 in.2 = 136 in.2 So, the surface area of the gure is 136 square inches. Right Circular Cylinders The formula for the surface area of a cylinder is SA = 2Urh + 2Ur2 where r is the radius and h is the height of the cylinder. 100100 - - GEOMETRY BASICS 5 ft. Practice 15. Find the surface area of a cylinder that has a diameter of 12 cm and a height of 20 cm. __________ 12 cm 20 cm Right Pyramids The formula for the surface area of a right pyramid is 1SA = __ 2ps + B w here B is the area of the base, p is the perimeter of base B, and s is the slant length. Since it is a right pyramid, the highest point is dire ctly above the center of the base. Thus, all four slant lengths are the same. Example For example, let's nd the surface area of the right py ramid pictured: 4 ft. 6.4 ft. We can see that the slant length, s, is 6.4 ft. To nd p and B, we need to do a few calculations. p = the p erimeter of base B = 5 ft. + 5 ft. + 4 ft. + 4 ft. = 18 ft. B = the area of the base = (5 ft.)(4 ft.) = 20 ft.2 Substitute these values into the formula: 1SA + 20 ft.2 = 57.6 ft.2 + 20 ft.2 = 77.6 ft.2 So, the surface area of the pyramid is 77.6 square feet. Right Circular Cones The formula for the surface area of a cone is SA = Urs + Ur2 where r is the radius and s is the slant length. Practice 16.

Notice that this formula is the area of one circle, Ur2, multiplied by 4. Let's calculate the radius of a sphere if its surface area is 113.04 square inches. In this problem, the surface area is given, and we need to solve for the radius. Substitute the value of the surface area into the formula and solve for r. SA = 4Ur2 r2 9in.2 = r 2 3 in. = r So, the radius of the sphere is 3 in. scale Factor A scale factor is a factor that multiplies a term to change the value at a constant rate. For example, if 4 is multiplied by a scale factor of 3, the value is now 12. Scale factors can be used in a variety of settings: maps, flo or plans, blueprints, and other geometric drawings. For example, to reproduce the floor plan of an ofce building on a size of paper that is manage-able, scale factors are necessary. If every shape and dime nsio n of the floor plan is reduced by the same factor, the drawing will be an accurate reproduction of the spatial dimensions.

First, let's nd how long it takes Re ggie to get to work using his normal route. He bikes 10 miles north and then 8 miles east for a total of 18 miles. If he bikes 18 mph, how long does it take him to get to work? Use the distance = rate \u00d7 time formula and solve for time: d = rt 18 = 18t __18 18t 18 = 18 1 hour = t It takes Reggie 1 hour to get to work using his normal route. To nd how long it would take him to get to work using the bike path, we need to nd its distance using the Pythagorean theorem. a 2 + b2= c2 102 + 82 = c2 2100 + 64 = c 2164 = c 164 = c 2 12.8 = c The distance from Reggie's house to work using the bike path is 12.8 miles. Use the distance for - mula to nd how long it will take Reggie to get to w ork using the bike path: d = rt 12.8 = 18t 0.71 hours = t To nd ho w much faster Reggie would get to work using the bike path versus his normal route, subtract the two times. 0.71 of an hour = (0.71)(60) = 42.6 ~ 43 minu tes 60 minutes - 43 minutes = 17 minutes So, if Reggie uses the bike path to get to work, he wil l get to work 17 minutes faster than by taking his normal route. 5. d. A regular octagon has eight sides, all of w hich are the same length. The perimeter is the length around the outside of a gure. If all eight sides of 4 cm each are added up, the perimeter is 32 cm. 6. $937.50. Since the garden is in the shape of a re gular pentagon, the side lengths are equiva- lent. Therefore, the perimeter is p = 5(15 ft.) = 75 ft. The c ost of the fencing is $12.50 per foot, so the total cost to fence in the community garden is C = (75 ft.)($12.50) = $937.50 7. 20 mm. Remember, the equation for circumfer - ence is C = 2Ur or C = Ud. Since we need to nd the diamet er to solve this problem, let's use C = Ud. C = Ud 62.8 mm = (3.14)d 20 mm = d 8. 28.8 in. First, you need to nd the side length of the squar e by solving for s using the equation for area: 2A = s 52 in.2 = s2 52 in.2 = s 2 7.2 in. = s Now that we know what s is, we can nd the perimeter: P = 4(7.2 in.) = 28.8 in. 9. 70.85 cm2. The equation for the area of a circle requires the value of the radius, r. However, in this problem we have been given the diameter. dRemember, d = 2r, so 2 = r. 9.5 cm = 4.75 cm = r2 Now, use the equation for area: A = Ur2 = U (4.75 $445.80.

From the diagram, we can see that the height of the cylinder is 8 inches and the radius is 5 inches. Substitute these values into the formula to solve for the volume. V = Ur 2h = U(5 in.)2(8 in.) (3.14)(200 in.3) = 628 in.3 13. d. U se the formula V = Ur2h, where r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the cylinder: U(1.52)4 = U \u00d7 2.25 \u00d7 4, which equals 9U. 14. 4.49 cm. The formula for the volume of a cone is V = 31r2h.

To substitute values into the for - mula SA = 2Urh + 2 Ur2, we rst need to identify the radius. The problem states that the diameter is 12 cm. The radius is half of the diameter, so the radius = 6 cm. Now, substitute values into the formula for the surface area of a cylinder: SA = 2Urh + 2 Ur2 979.68 cylinder is 979.68 2cm . 16. 1,099 mm2.

M ethod 1: Choose a few examples of the given situation and anal yze the results. Example: If square A has sides of length 10, square B will have sides of length 5. Then, the area of A is 100, and the area of B is 25. The area of square A is 4 times the area of square B. Example: If square A has sides of length 6, square B will have sides of length 3. T hen, the area of A is 36, and the area of B is 9. The area of square A is 4 times the area of square B. If you continue to try other situations, the r esults will be the same. The area of the larger square is always 4 times the area of the smaller square. Method 2: The situation can be analyzed algebraically. L ength of side of square B = x Length of side of square A = 2x 2Area of square B = x 2Area of square A = (2x)2 = 4x 4x2 is 4 times x2. 2. d. A ll sides of a square are the same length. The perimeter is the distance around the outside of a gure. You can divide the perimeter of a square by 4 to determine the length of a side: 24 \u00f7 4 = 6. Therefore, the length of a side of the square is 6 inches. To nd the area, multiply the length by the width. In a square, the length and the width are the same. In this case, they are both 6 inches, and 6 \u00d7 6 = 36. The area of the square is 36 square inches. 3. c. T o nd the area of the shaded region, sub-tract the area of the circle from the area of the sq uare. Notice that the radius of the circle is half the length of one side of the square.

The perimeter of a gure is the dis-tance around it. For a regular octagon (whose sid es all have equal lengths), the perimeter can be found by multiplying the length of one side times the total number of sides. According to the diagram, the length of each side of the octa- gon is 3x - 2, so the perimeter is 8(3x - 2). B e sure to distribute the 8 to both terms inside the parentheses so as not to arrive at 24x - 2, which is incorrect. When the 8 is distributed correctly, P = 8(3x) - 8(2) = 24 x - 16 108108 - - GEOMETRY BASICS 9. b. T here are two ways to solve this problem. The rst is to divide the room into two rectangles, calculate the area of each, and add the areas together. There are two ways to divide the room into two rectangles: 3 3 5 5 7 7 In the diagram on the left, one rectangle has a length of 5 feet and a width of 7 feet and the other has a length of 10 feet, resulting from 7 + 3, and a width of 7, resulting from 12 - 5. To nd the area of the room, set up the following equation: (5 ft.)(7 ft.) + (10 ft.)(7 ft.). This yields 105 ft. 2 as the area of the room. In the diagram on the right, one rectangle has a length of 12 feet and a width of 7 feet and the other has a length of 7 feet, resulting from 12 - 5, and a width of 3 feet. To nd the area of the room, set up the fol- lowing equation: (12 ft.)(7 ft.) + (7 ft.)(3 ft.). This also yields 105 ft. 2 as the area of the room. The second method is to calculate the area of the big rectangle\u2014(12 ft.)(10 ft.)\u2014and subtract the area of the part of the room that is missing\u2014(5 ft.)(3 ft.). This equation reads 120 ft. 2 - 15 ft.2 = 105 square feet. 10. c. T he perimeter of a gure is the distance around the gure. Since the opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, and one side of this rectangle has a length of 8, another side also has a length of 8. The set of num- bers whose sum is 64 when added to 8 is 8 + 8 + 24 + 24 = 64. 109109 TESTPREP_04MATH_93-110.indd 110 3/31/15 4:53 PM chapter5 STaTiSTiCS and ProbabiliTy The eld of statistics revolves around data\u2014how it is collected, organized, manipulated, and presented. Probability is a specic application of statistics that aims to arrive at conclusions based on current tendencies. This chapter reviews some basic concepts in statistics, such as the mean (average) and median of a data set. Measures of Central Tendencies Measures of central tendencies are a way to talk about a data set using one number to summarize the data. As you will see throughout this book, many sections of the GED\u00ae test will require you to understand how to both nd and interpret these measurements in order to understand data presented, whether it be something like sci-entic experiment data, information in a social studies population table, or a straightforward math problem.

If the average number of students per group was 3.2, and one of the unknown groups had one more student than the other unknown group, what is the average number of students who came to see Ms. Reba each day? First, interpret the words into math. We know that one of the Wednesday groups had one more stu-dent than the other. Assign x to o ne of the groups and x + 1 to the other. Next, add up all the numbers, divide by 10, and set it equal to the known average of 3.2: 2 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + _________________________________ x + x + 1 + 4 + 2 10 = 3.2 10(28 + 2_________ x) 10 = (3.2)10 28 + 2 x = 32 -28 -28 2x = 4 __ 2x 4 2 = __ 2 x = 2 S o now we know that one of the Wednesday groups had 2 stud ents (x ) and the other had 3 students (x + 1).

To understand the concept, consider this question: What is the median of the following data val ues? 63, 72, 54, 69, 66 To nd the median, rst rewrite the numbers in chr onological order: 54, 63, 66, 69, 72 The median is 66 because there are two numbers to the le ft and tw o numbers to the right of it. 54, 63, 66 , 69, 72 Finding the median is very simple when there is an odd number of values. However, what if there is an even number of values? In that case, take the average of the middle two numbers. What is the median of the following data val- ues? 23, 10, 31, 5, 39, 33 First, rewrite the values in chronological order: 5, 10, 23, 31, 33, 39 The two middle numbers are 23 and 31: 5, 10, 23, 31, 33, 39 The median of this data set is the average of 23 and 31: 23 + 31______ 2 = 27 Mode The mode of a data set is the number that appears most often.

T o explain this concept, let's look at a few examples. Example Suppose Shirley owns a bakery and is ordering supp lies to make her famous pies. If she orders a shipment of 20 cans of peaches for $32.50 and a shipment of 24 cans of cherries for $34.00, what is the average price Shirley pays per can of fruit? The price of the peaches is different from the price of the cher ries. Therefore, the prices have different rele- vance when calculating the average. To nd the answer to this question, you need to nd the sum of the total cost of fruit and divide by the number of cans: Let's work through another example: Five-y ear-old Larry made up a card game using four tens, three jacks, two queens, and one king. He assigned a point value to each of the cards, which is shown in this table: Card FrequenCy PoinT V alue Tens 4 5 Jacks 3 10 Queens 2 15 Kings 1 20 What is the average point value of each card? Since each card is assigned a different value, we will need t o calculate a weighted average. To do so, we must rst multiply the number of each card by its point value and then add up the total value of all the cards. (4)(5) = 20 (3)(10) = 30 2(15) = 30 1(20) = 20 20 + 30 + 30 + 20 = 100 Next, we'll divide the total value of all the cards by the total numb er of cards used in the game. There are 10 cards used in the game (4 + 3 + 2 + 1). So, the (weighted) average value of each card is: 100 \u00f7 10 = 10 points Practice 4. My rna teaches at a university.

What is the probability of grabbing a blue candy out of a bag with the following contents? ____________ Green 6 Yellow 5 Brown 10 Red 8 Blue 7 Orange 6 Compound Probability Compound probability refers to events with more than one condition. For instance, consider the follow-ing question. What is the probability of getting heads twice in a row? An extra step is required to solve compound proba-bility problems. First, calculate the probability of getting heads __ 1once: 2 . Then, calculate the probability of getting heads a second time. The result is the same: __ 1 2. 115115 - - __ 1 \u00d7 __ 1 __ 1 2 2= 4 STATISTICS AND PROBABILITY To nd the probability of both of these events together, you multiply: The compound probability, then, of both of these __ 1events occurring is 4 , or 25%. Example S uppose there are eight tennis balls in a container: ve green and three red. What is the probability of pulling out a green ball on the rst try and then a red ball on the second try, without adding the rst green ball back into the container? To nd the answer to this problem, let's rst nd the probability of pulling a green tennis ball out of the container. There are ve green tennis balls and eight total tennis balls. Therefore, the probability of pulling out a green tennis ball on the rst try is __ 5 8. Now you have to consider how the problem changes after this rst step, as you calculate the prob- ability of pulling a red ball the second time. After tak- ing the green tennis ball out of the container, there are only seven balls left\u2014the total has changed from eight to seven. There are three red tennis balls. There- fore, the probability of pulling out a red tennis ball after the green tennis ball is __ 37. Find the compound probability of these events by m ultiplying: __ 5 \u00d7 __ 3 __15 8 7= 56 Practice 7. Refer to the table with the number of candies, reprinted here: Green 6 Yellow 5 Brown 10 Red 8 Blue 7 Orange 6 What is the percentage probability of grabbing a blue candy the rst time and then another blue candy the next time, without replacing the rst blue candy? ____________ Counting Techniques The counting techniques featured on the GED\u00ae test are permutations and combinations. Permutations Permutations are combinations where the order matters. For instance, a question might ask for the number of ways rst, second, third, and fourth place trophies could be awarded to 15 different teams. This is an example of a permutation because you're not just nding four teams, you're being asked to nd four teams in a dened and ranked order. Let's work out this example to illustrate this co ncept. T here are 15 different teams and only four tr ophies. How many teams could win rst place? 15 Aft er the rst place trophy is given out, how many teams are left to win second place? 14 Aft er second place is handed out, how many teams are left to win third place? 13 Aft er third place is handed out, how many teams are left to win fourth place? 12 T herefore, the number of possible combinations for the 15 teams t o win the four trophies is: 15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 = 116116 - - STATISTICS AND PROBABILITY __________________________________________ 13 \u00d7 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) Permutations Formula There is a formula that can be applied to any problem re garding permutation: P(n,k) = ______n!, where n is the number of options and k is the number of choices made. U sing the preceding problem to illustrate this for - mula, n = 15 and k = 4: 15!P(15,4) = _______ (15 - 4)! 15 1 15 \u00d7 14 \u00d7 13 \u00d7 12 = 32,760. Practice 8. There are 20 athletes competing in a swim meet for rst, second, and third places. How many different ways could the trophies be awarded? ___________ Combinations Order does not matter with combinations. For instance, the number of combinations of three differ - ent appetizers a group could order at a restaurant is an e xample of a combination. It does not matter what order the chosen appetizers are listed in: salad, soup, and flatbread is the same as soup, flatbread, and salad. The formula for combinations is similar to the one for permutations; however, another factor is added to the denominator to reduce the number of possibilities. Again, if order does not matter, then 1, 2, 3 is the same as 3, 2, 1; thus, the combination is counted only once. Combinations Formula nC______ P( ,k) ________ n!(n,k) = k! = k!(n - k)! , where n is the number of options and k is the number of choices made. N otice that the only difference between the for - mula for permutation and combination is the k! in the denominator of the combination formula. Again, this is to eliminate repetitive combinations in the answer, since order does not matter. Example Let's say there are 13 different appetizers to choose fro m at a restaurant. There is a special where you can order three appetizers for $12.99. How many differ - ent combinations of three appetizers could you or der? Using the combinations formula, n = 1 3 and k = 3. 13 ___________________________________________ \u00d7 12 \u00d7 11 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1) = _____ 1,716 6 = 286 T hus, there are 286 different combinations of three diffe rent appetizers when there are 13 options to choose from.

Then, add the percentages together to nd Chad's nal grade: Final grade = 0.70( 78 + 85 + 88 + 90)4 + 0.10(87 + 90 + 83 + 93+ 91 + 90 6 ) + 0.20(82) = 0.70(85.25) + 0.10(89) + 0.20(82) = 59.675 + 8.9 + 16.4 = 84.975 Chad's nal grade is ~ 85%. 5. 92.33%. T o nd Katie's nal grade, a weighted average must be calculated since Mr. Gallespie weights each type of assignment differently. Find the average score of each type of assign- ment, multiply it by its percentage weight, then a dd the percentages together to get Katie's nal grade. Final grade = 0.60(93 + 97 + 88 + 91+ 95 5) + 0.15(90 + 99 + 100 + 95 + 96 5) + 0.25(89 + 90 + 85 + 92 4) = 0.60(92.8) + 0.15(96) + 0.25(89) = 55.68 + 14.4 + 22.25 = 92.33 6. 1 6 .

To nd the ice cream flavor that is the mode during Ethan's shift, nd the ice cream flavor that was sold more than any other flavor. Add up the number of ice cream cone sales by flavor: butter pecan: 1 c hocolate: 5 coffee: 2 mint: 2 pistachio: 2 strawberry: 3 vanilla: 2 The ice cream flavor that was sold the most d uring Ethan's shift was chocolate, so it is the mode. 2. c. T he median of a data set is the piece of data that occurs right in the middle after the data is put in order. To nd the median number of hours Phoebe will work in one day over the next three weeks, put the number of hours she works each day in order and choose the number in the middle: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 4 , 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 7 T here are 21 days on the schedule, so the mid- dle number is the eleventh number shown ab ove, 4. The median number of hours Phoebe will work is 4. 3. d. T he mean, or average score, of Pat's ve games is 146. That means that Pat scores a total of 5 \u00d7 146, or 730, over ve games. Let x represent Pat's score in the fth game. His total score over ve games is equal to: 123 + 165 + 127 + 144 + x = 559 + x N ow, set that total equal to Pat's total score, 730: 559 + x = 730 Subtract 559 from both sides: x = 171 P at scores 171 in his fth game. To check your answer, add Pat's score in each of the ve games and divide the sum by 5: 123 + 165 + 127 + 144 + 171 = 730 T he dividend should be equal to Pat's mean, 146: 730 \u00f7 5 = 146 4. b.

If Evander selects another coin, the probability that it will be a quarter is 2 15. 7. b. T his is a situation of probability with depen-dent events (i.e., the rst event is dependent on the se cond event). Therefore, we need to multi- ply the two separate probabilities together to get the c ompound probability. For the rst card, there are two possibilities out of a total of 28 cards. For the second card, there is only one chance that Yolanda will pick the matching card out of a remaining 27 cards. Multiply these two fractions together to get the answer: 2 1 2 1 = = 28 \u00d7 27 756 378 8. c. T his is a problem involving permutation, which requires the following formula: n! (n - r)!, where n = the total number of options and r = the number of options chosen. Since there are seven teams that could win a trophy, n = 7. Only three teams will get trophies, so r = 3. When these values are substituted into the n! 7! 7 \u00b7 6 \u00b7 5 \u00b7 4 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 2 \u00b7 1equation, we get = = (n - r)!

It is important to understand that the order in which she chooses the CDs does not matter. The group of CDs A, B, C, and D is the same as the group A, B, D, and C, or D, C, A, and B. This is a combination problem, so you must use the combination formula to nd the answer: n!C(n,k) = k!(n - k)! , where n is the number of options and k is the number of choices made. Joan has seven CDs and chooses four. Divide by 4! t o ensure that you do not count the same group of four CDs more than once: 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 210= = = 353 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 6 10. 1.75 hours.

Good luck! 124124 chapter6 ReaDInG CoMpRehenSIon Many of the questions on the GED\u00ae RLA test are designed to uncover how well you understand and think about what you read. Each of these questions will be tied to a reading passage\u2014for instance, a newspaper article, part of a novel, or a president's speech. You'll need to read the pas- s age carefully in order to answer the question correctly. In some cases, the answer will be obvious to you; in other cases, y ou'll have to do a little detective work to gure out the correct choice. Answers and explanations for all practice questions are at the end of the chapter. Main Ideas and Supporting Details In this section, we'll walk you step-by-step through many of the tools you'll need to become a good detective and improve your score on the GED\u00ae RLA test. One of the most important skills to have when you read a pas-sage on the GED\u00ae test (or in everyday life, for that matter) is the ability to identify the main idea of the passage and to se e how the writer supports that idea. 125 - - reading comprehension Subject versus Main Idea There's a difference between the subject of a piece of writing and its main idea. To see the difference, read through the following short passage: pRoMpT Today's postal service is more efficient and reliable than ever before. Mail that used to take months to move by horse and by foot now moves around the country in days or hours by truck, train, and plane. First-class mail usually moves from New York City to Los Angeles in three days or less. If your let - ter or package is urgent, the U.S. Postal Se rvice offers Priority Mail and Express Mail services. Priority Mail is guaranteed to go anywhere in the United States in two days or less. Express Mail will get your package there overnight. Say someone asked you, \"What is the main idea of this reading?\" You might be tempted to answer, \"The post ofce.\" But you'd be wrong. This passage is about the post ofce, yes\u2014but the post ofce is not the main idea of the passage. The post ofce is merely the subject of the passage (who or what the passage is about). The main idea must say something about this subject. The main idea of a text is usually an assertion abou t the subject. An assertion is a statement that requires evidence (proof) to be accepted as true. The main idea is also something more: it is the idea that holds together or controls the passage. The other sen-tences and ideas in the passage will relate to that main idea and serve as evidence that the assertion is true. You might think of the main idea as a net that is cast over the other sentences. The main idea must be gen-eral enough to hold all of these sentences together. Let's take another look at the postal service parag raph, this time to identify the main idea. Look for the idea that makes an assertion about the postal service and holds together or controls the whole paragraph. Which of the following three statements best summar izes the main idea? A. Express Mail is a good way to send urgent mail. B. Mail service today is more effective and de pendable than it was in the past. C. First-class mail usually takes three days or less. Because choice A is sp ecic\u2014it tells us only about Express Mail\u2014it cannot be the main idea. It does not encompass the rest of the sentences in the paragraph (for instance, it doesn't cover Priority Mail or rst-class mail). Choice C is also too specic. It tells us only about rst-class mail. Choice B is the correct answer. It is general enough to encompass the whole passage, and each of the other sentences in the para-graph offers proof that the idea is true. Topic Sentences You'll notice that in the paragraph about the postal service, the main idea is expressed clearly in the rst sentence: Today's postal service is more efcient and reliable than ever before. A sentence that clearly states the main idea of a paragraph or passage is called a topic sentence. In most cases, as in the postal service paragraph, the t opic sentence is located at (or near) the begin- ning of the passage. Sometimes, however, it is located at the end\u2014the writer gives his or her supporting evidence up front and then reveals at the end what all of that evidence adds up to. Less often, but on occa-sion, the topic sentence can be found in the middle of the passage. W hatever the case, the topic sentence\u2014like To day's postal service is more efcient and reliable than ever before\u2014is an assertion, and it needs proof. In a well-written passage, the writer will supply facts and 126126 - - reading comprehension ideas throughout the text as proof that his or her main idea is right. noTe Not all topic sentences state the main idea as clearly as the topic sentence in the pas - sage. Throughout this chapter, you'll learn to use tools that will help you interpret what you read, so you will be able to identify less obvious topic sentences, as well as under - stand passages that do not have a topic sentence at all. Supporting Evidence Supporting evidence is the set of specic facts and ideas that explain and support the main idea. These details provide you with a more complete picture of what the author is trying to say. Supporting evidence can be factual informa- tion, reasoning, examples, and descriptions that relate to the main id ea. Let's go back briefly to that paragraph on the postal se rvice: pRoMpT Today's postal service is more efficient and reliable than ever before. Mail that used to take months to move by horse and by foot now moves around the country in days or hours by truck, train, and plane. First-class mail usually moves from New York City to Los Angeles in three days or less. If your let - ter or package is urgent, the U.S. Postal Se rvice offers Priority Mail and Express Mail services. Priority Mail is guaranteed to go anywhere in the United States in two days or less. Express Mail will get your package there overnight. In this case, the paragraph is chock-full of evidence that supports the main idea (which is Today's postal service is more efcient and reliable than ever before). For example, look at the second sentence: Mail that used to take months to move by horse and by f oot now moves around the country in days or hours by truck, train, and plane. The fact that the postal service can move mail around the c ountry in days or hours provides evidence that it has improved its efciency since the time when this process took months. The other sentences provide even more evi- dence of efciency\u2014explaining that mail can get to its d estination in three days, in two days, or overnight (all much quicker than months!). In addition, the next to last sentence in the parag raph offers support for the topic sentence's assertion that the postal service is more reliable: Priority Mail is guaranteed to go anywhere in the Unit ed States in two days or less. The last sentence also helps to bolster that claim: Express Mail will get your package there ov ernight.

Most of these tragedies can be avoided with a few simple precautions. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) collects information on weather-related deaths to learn how to prevent these tragedies. Many lightning victims say they were caught outside in the storm and couldn't get to a safe place. Other victims waited too long before seeking shelter; by heading to a safe place five to ten minutes sooner, they could have avoided being struck by lightning. Some people were struck because they went back outside too soon. Finally, some victims were struck inside homes or buildings while they were using electrical equipment or corded phones or were in contact with plumbing, a metal door, or a window frame. There are a few things you might not know about lightning. First, all thunderstorms produce li ghtning and are dangerous. In the United States, in an average year, lightning kills about the same number of people as tornadoes do and causes more deaths than hurricanes do. Lightning often strikes outside the area of heavy rain and may strike as far as ten miles from any rainfall. Many lightning deaths occur ahead of storms or after storms have seemingly passed. What should you do if you are caught outside near a thunderstorm? Keep in mind that there is no safe place outside in a thunderstorm. If you're outside and hear thunder, the only way to significantly reduce your risk of becoming a lightning casualty is to get inside a substantial build-ing or hard-topped metal vehicle as fast as you can. In addition, you should avoid open areas, is olated tall trees, towers, or utility poles. Stay away from metal conductors such as wires or fences. Metal does not attract lightning, but lightning can travel long distances through it. If you are with a group of people, spread out. While this actually increases the chances that someone might get struck, it tends to prevent multiple casualties and increases the chances that someone could help if a person is struck. Remember, if you can hear thunder, you are in danger. Don't be fooled by blue skies. If there is thunder, lightning is close enough to pose an immediate danger. Stay inside a safe building or vehicle for at least 30 minutes after you hear the last thunder clap. \u2014Adapted from an article by the Federal Citizens Information Center ( publications.USA.gov) . 128128 - - reading comprehension 1.

Facts versus o pinions A fact is a statement of truth. It is based on direct evi- dence, actual experience, or observation. An opinio n is a statement of belief, judgment, or feeling. It shows someone's personal thoughts about a subject. Some opinions are based on facts, but they are still some- one's personal feelings about a subject, not facts themse lves. Opinions are debatable; facts are not. As an example of fact versus opinion, look at these two se ntences, which discuss the same event: Today, the president of North American Airlines, Mar ia Delgado, announced that she is lowering employee pay by 50%, discontinuing health insurance, and reducing vacation time by 30%. In her announcement today, the president of Nor th American Airlines, Maria Delgado, showed that she cares more about money than her employees' welfare by slashing pay and vacation time and axing health insurance. Both sentences describe Maria Delgado's announce-ment, but there is a big difference in how they do so. The rst sentence is completely fact ual\u2014it communicates only the facts of the day. The second sentence is highly opinionated . It communicates cer - tain facts\u2014that Maria Delgado is the president of No rth American Airlines, that she made an announcement today, and that she will be cutting pay, health coverage, and vacation time\u2014but mixed in with those facts is a lot of opinion: that her plans show that she cares more about money than about the employees. 129129 n n n n - - reading comprehension The writer also communicates his or her opin- ion by using words such as slashing and axing \u2014they have a negative implication. By using these words instead of neutral words like reducing, lowering, or ending, the writer emphasizes the belief that Ms. Del-gado's plans are violent and harmful to employees. Another important difference between the sen- tences is that the rst sentence contains facts that are eithe r right or wrong, while the second sentence is open to conversation and debate. Others might have a completely different opin- ion of Ms. Delgado and her actions at North Ameri-can Airlines. For example, they may say that Ms. De lgado is really a nice woman who is doing all she can to help her employees during a difcult time. Even though the company has less money this year, she is not laying off any workers, but she has to reduce pay and benets to keep them on. Still others might have yet another opinion of Ms. D elgado and her plan. observations and Inferences Making observations means looking carefully at the text and noticing specic things about how it is writ- ten. You may notice, for example, the point of view that the au thor has chosen. You may also notice: Particular words and phrases the writer uses The way those words and phrases are arranged in sentences and paragraphs Repeated word patterns or sentence patterns Important details about people, places, and things If you make good observations, you can then make val id inferences. Inferences are conclusions that you make based on reasons, facts, or evidence. You are constantly making inferences based on your obser - vations, even when you're not reading. For example, if y ou notice that the sky is full of dark, heavy clouds, you might infer that it is going to rain; if you notice that your coworker has a stack of gardening books on her desk, you might infer that she likes to garden. On the GED\u00ae RLA test, you may be asked to make an inference about a character, setting, or situation based on the information that is provided in a passage. If you make an incorrect inference, it is proba- bly because you haven't looked closely enough at the passage. As a result, you may base your inferences on your own ideas and experiences, not on what's actu-ally written in the passage. If that's the case, it means you are forcing your own ideas on the author rather than listening to what the author has to say. It's criti-cal, then, to pay close attention to what the writer is say ing and how he or she says it.

Arsenic is present in the environment as a naturally occurring substance and also as a result of contamination from human activity, such as past use of fertilizers and arsenic-based pesticides, which may still be in the soil, explains Donald Zink, PhD, senior science adviser at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"While en vironmental contaminants like arsenic are unavoidable in food,\" says Zink, \"the goal is to keep the levels of arsenic that people consume over the course of their lives as low as possible.\" That's where the FDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) come in. Their job is to monitor food and the environment and take action when needed to protect the American public. The FDA has been testing and monitoring fruit juices, including apple juice, for arsenic content for more than 20 years, says Michael R. Taylor, the FDA's deputy commissioner for foods. \"We are confident in the overall safety of apple juice consumed in this country because we con-tinue to find that apple juice, on average, contains low amounts of arsenic.\" In fact, the FDA's most recent tests done in 2010 and 2011 show on average about three pa rts of arsenic in every one billion parts of apple juice. That is lower than the 10 parts per billion (ppb) set by the EPA as the maximum level allowed in public drinking water. \"Our test results over many years support the overall safety of apple juice,\" says Taylor, \"but we see a small percentage of individual samples tested that contain higher levels of arsenic. We want to minimize the public's exposure to arsenic in foods as much as we can.\" For that reason, the FDA plans to consider all the relevant evidence, and based on this work, it may set a guidance or other maximum level to further reduce arsenic in apple juice and juice products. To further protect the public's health, the FDA is also taking the following actions: n Enhancing its surveillance of arsenic in apple juice and juice concentrate. The agency will shortly have results for an additional 90 samples of apple juice and juice concentrate and soon after will sample additional types of juice and juice concentrates. n Continuing to test samples of apple juice imported into the United States from China. The most recent results included more than 70 samples from China, and 95% of these con - tained less than the 10 ppb level used for drinking water. n Working with the EPA to coordinate the review of the risk assessment being prepared and discussing other steps the two agencies can take to reduce the overall levels of arsenic in the environment and in foods. T he bottom line is that the FDA is working hard to ensure the safety of the foods people consume and to do so based on the best science. And the best thing families can do is to con- sume a variety of foods and beverages and follow a well-balanced diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. 131131 3. 4. n - - reading comprehension W hich of the following statements can be infe rred from the recommendation at the very end: the best thing families can do is to consume a variety of foods and beverages? a. If you don't focus too much of your diet on one f ood or beverage\u2014such as apple juice\u2014 to begin with, you will have a lower risk of exposure to any contaminants found in that food or beverage. b. Apple juice is one of many beverages av ailable to consumers in the United States. c. One way of reducing obesity in the United States is f or people to consume a variety of fruits and vegetables, including apple products. d. It can be difcult to encourage children to tr y other types of juices, but parents should make the effort. Which of the following statements is the most log ical inference based on the purpose of the article and the information it contains? a. Apple juice is being monitored for arsenic be cause more juice products are being imported from sources outside the United States, such as China. b. Apple juice is being monitored for arsenic be cause the FDA recently discovered high levels of arsenic in other types of juice. c. Apple juice is being monitored for arsenic be cause it is a popular beverage. d. Apple juice is being monitored for arsenic be cause it has surpassed orange juice in consumer preference. Theme We've already discussed ways of nding the main idea in nonction passages (newspaper articles, docu-ments, and other kinds of writing that contain facts and/or opinions). You'll nd many reading passages of this type on the GED\u00ae RLA test. You'll also nd another type of passage: ction. These will be excerpts from novels or short stories\u2014writing that tells a story that is either completely or partially imaginary. Every work of ction contains a theme: the idea that lies beneath the story. The theme can be a lesson or message of the story, a question that the author is asking through the story, or a general concept. Themes are similar to main ideas, but there is one big difference: Unlike in nonction writing, where writ-ers often summarize their main idea in a topic sen-tence or a paragraph, the theme of a work of ction is rar ely spelled out so clearly. To nd it, you will need to read closely and consider not just what the story is about but how the writer tells that story. In other words, look past the action (or plot), and ask yourself what it all may mean. As an example, say you're reading a novel about a p oor woman's journey from Korea to the United States in the 1940s. It may describe the details of the character's childhood on a farm in Korea, the boat trip that she took as a young adult to San Francisco, the elderly man who swindled her out of her life sav-ings because she didn't speak English, the difculties she ha d nding a job, and the satisfaction she ulti- mately felt as she worked hard to make a living. These are the facts of the plot, but the theme of the novel is something very different. Here are some possible themes: n The theme could be a message or lesson. For instance: You can reach your goals more easily if you block out your problems and focus only on your goal. The theme could be a question. For instance: Do you lose part of yourself when you leave your cul- ture? Is it better to stay where you are and face the difculties there, or do you become more of your real self when you leave your culture and make your own way in the world? 132132 - - reading comprehension n n n n n n The theme could be a specic idea about life or people. For instance: Desperation brings out the very worst in people and the very best. The theme could also be a simpler, more general c oncept. For instance, perhaps the novel is an exploration of the theme of youth and aging. Note that more than one theme may be valid for a wo rk of ction, and other readers may come to a dif- ferent conclusion than you do. This is part of the re ward of reading ction\u2014seeing the ideas behind what you read and discussing those ideas with other people. (Often these are ideas about life, which will be interesting to you as you make your own way in the world.) noTe Although a work of fiction may have more than one possible theme, don't worry that this will cause confusion on the GED \u00ae RLA test. Every question about theme on the GED \u00ae RLA test will have only one, clearly correct answer. There are no \"trick\" ques-tions on the exam. Finding the Theme As you read a work of ction closely, pay attention to the following elements in order to nd the theme: Repetition: Note whether the author repeats cer - tain w ords, phrases, symbols, actions, or ideas, or whe ther certain characters reappear throughout a story. This is often a clue that those words, phrases, characters, and so on have a special importance in the story\u2014and to the theme. Connections: In many stories, one specic thing ma y not be repeated, but if you look closely, you'll nd that the writer uses repetition in a more complicated way. For example, let's say the rst chapter of a book takes place in a house by a river, which is flooding after a bad storm. The climax of the book takes place on a train that's traveling through the dusty plains of Texas. The end of the book takes place on a street in New York City, where children have uncapped a re hydrant and are playing in the water. While a river, a plain, and a re hydrant are very different things, there is a pattern running through the book: water\u2014either too much or too little. Ask yourself if this pattern helps to reveal the theme. Timing: Consider when events occur in a story and w hether there is a pattern. For example, let's say in one short story, whenever the main charac-ter, a reghter, puts on his reghting uniform in the mor ning, a mouse\u2014a common symbol for cowardice and weakness\u2014peeks its head out of a hole in the wall. Is this pattern a reminder that we all have to battle our weaknesses? Or that even when someone acts bravely, he or she is still vul-nerable? Patterns are usually connected to the theme and can he lp us understand it. Omission: Often it's what a writer doesn't write ab out that's most important. Is there a detail or event that's glaringly left out of the story? This may be directly tied to the theme.

In today's high-tech society, many potential employers are turning to social media to learn more about you. \"Before you even walk through the door for your first interview, it is highly likely the person waiting on the other side has seen more than just your resume,\" says Lauren Berger, CEO of InternQueen.com . \"The way you present yourself online speaks volumes to hiring managers about yo ur tech savvy and comfort level with social media\u2014both critical skills demanded by virtually every employer.\" With technology playing an established role in our lives and social networks easily accessible to potential employers, establishing a strong digital footprint and personal brand is crucial to suc- cess. So how can you use technology to land that first job and make the best first impression? Here are four top tech tools and social media tips for landing your dream job: 1. Get organized. While it may seem like a minor detail, one of the first things you should do i s get a professional e-mail address. The college e-mail or cutesy address you created back in high school won't impress a job recruiter. 2. Leverage your networks and set infor ma tional interviews. Make a target list of employers you'd like to work for and do some research about them, identifying one person from each company whom you'd like to meet. Reach out to that person and explain that you're really interested in the company and what his or her department does. Then ask if he or she will take five minutes to sit down and tell you how he or she got started and give you some advice. 3. Put your best \"digital foot\" forwar d. You have one chance to make a first impression, so make sure it's a good one. This means not only dressing professionally but also using your style (both online and off) to demonstrate your personal interests. Building your personal brand and establishing relationships within the industry will help open doors to opportuni-ties you may not have discovered otherwise. Make sure that your online presence is up to da te and also reflects your best attributes. This includes maintaining a consistent resume and work experience information across your networks to build familiarity among possible recruiters. 4. Lead with your str en gths. Ask your friends and previous employers what your strengths are, and use specific examples during your interview to highlight them. You can also use this opportunity to demonstrate your experience with technology. If you are consistently told how well organized you are, share a previous work experience that demonstrates how you used technology and what value this brings to the employer. If you have a laptop or a tablet computer, consider bringing it to the interview to show off your portfolio of work. This instantly demonstrates you're on the cutting edge of new technology\u2014a value for any employer. These seemingly simple tips can help you stand out from the crowd and boost your chances of finding that great job. 134134 - - reading comprehension n n n 5. Of the following choices, which skills does the eXCeRpT author emphasize as being important to poten - tial employers? a. leadership and the ability to resolve conflict b. digital literacy and expertise with Internet co mmunications c. loyalty and a strong work ethic d. creativity and knowledge of computer hard ware 6. Based on the passage, which of the following state ments would the author most likely make when advising someone who was recently laid off and is in the process of applying for jobs? a. Update your career wardrobe and hire a pr ofessional to revise your resume. b. Consider getting retrained in a eld that is gr owing in career opportunities. c. Evaluate how your job qualications can be de monstrated through the use of technology. d. Schedule as many informational interviews as you can at ea ch company you are interested in, and attend a weekly job-support group. Relationships and Structure Understanding how different elements develop in a passage is a crucial part of reading comprehension. In this section, we discuss some of the building blocks of writing and see how they interrelate. Descriptive Elements Authors use descriptive elements and details to help readers create a mental picture. Descriptive details in writing let you more easily visualize a person, place, object, or event. In this excerpt from the short story \"A Rose for Emily\" by William Faulkner, do you see how detailed Faulkner gets when describing the character? They rose when she entered\u2014a small, fat woman in black, with a thin gold chain descending to her waist and vanishing into her belt, leaning on an ebony cane with a tarnished gold head. Her skeleton was small and spare; perhaps that was why what would have been merely plumpness in another was obesity in her. She looked bloated, like a body long submerged in motionless water, and of that pallid hue. Her eyes, lost in the fatty ridges of her face, looked like two small pieces of coal pressed into a lump of dough as they moved from one face to another while the visitors stated their errand. As you can see, the writer uses many specic details to help you create a picture in your mind of what Miss Emily looks like and how she acts. Look at how richly he describes the character in just the rst sentence: a small, fat woman in black a thin gold chain descending to her waist and van - ishing int o her belt leaning on an ebony cane with a tarnished gold head T hese elaborate descriptions add to your understand- ing of the character. They help you better understand the e vents in the story\u2014the portrait of Miss Emily grows with every detail and sets you up for her meet-ing with her visitors. Interpreting Relationships When you see a passage on the GED\u00ae test, pay special attention to how different people or characters relate to one another. Thinking about why the author puts each person, place, and thing into a passage will help you better understand it. 135135 n n n - - reading comprehension Here is another excerpt from \"A Rose for Emily\": eXCeRpT [Miss Emily's] voice was dry and cold. \"I have no taxes in Jefferson. Colonel Sartoris explained it to me. Perhaps one of you can gain access to the city records and satisfy yourselves.\" \"But we have. We are the city authori- ties, Miss Emily. Didn't you get a notice from the sherif f, signed by him?\" \"I received a paper, yes,\" Miss Emily sa id. \"Perhaps he considers himself the sheriff. . . . I have no taxes in Jefferson.\" \"But there is nothing on the books to show that, you see. We must go by the\u2014\" \" See Colonel Sartoris. I have no taxes in Jefferson.\" \"But Miss Emily\u2014\" \" See Colonel Sartoris.\" (Colonel Sarto- ri s had been dead almost ten years.) \"I have no taxes in Jefferson. Tobe! . . . Show these gentlemen out.\" Based on the dialogue between Miss Emily and the town authorities, the reader understands that Miss Emily is not intimidated by them. The town authori-ties, on the other hand, are confused by Miss Emily's unw illingness to bow to their power. Furthermore, do you see how your understanding of this conversation is affected by the colorful description of Miss Emily that you read earlier? Without that detailed descrip-tion, you might have had a very different interpreta-tion of the conversation. Structure Readers also need to understand how an author orga-nizes his or her writing and how this affects its overall meaning. You may be asked to identify these features of a passage: cause and effect sequence of events or time order of events compare and contrast Cause and Effect I n a cause-and-eff ect relationship, one action or event (the cause) creates another action or event (the effect). Consider the following examples: Because she'd studied for the GED\u00ae every morn-ing during her commute to work, Maria felt read y to take the test. Here, the cause is Maria's studying every morning dur ing her commute. The effect is the fact that she feels ready to take the test. If it rains too hard, we'll have to cancel the picnic. Here, heavy rain would cause the cancellation of the picnic (the eff ect). Sequence Sequence is the order in which events happen over time. Some passages describe events chronologically: in the same order that they occurred in real life or in the make-believe world of a novel or a short story. For instance, in a novel about a doomed love affair, if the writer chooses to tell the story in chronological order, the book may begin with the couple meeting for the rst time, then describe moments in their relationship, and end with their breakup. 136136 - - reading comprehension n n n n n n n n n n n n n n That same love affair could also be described in a completely different order: for example, the writer could start the story with their breakup, and then piece together why that breakup happened by describing moments in the couple's relationship through memories or flashbacks. When you read pas-sages on the GED\u00ae test, pay close attention to the seq uence of events\u2014if the sequence is tricky, you are sure to see questions asking about it! Compare and Contrast We spend a good deal of our lives comparing and co ntrasting things. When we want to explain some- thing, for example, we often co mpare it to something else (showing how two or more things are similar). We might say, for example, that mint chocolate chip ice cream tastes just like a peppermint-lled choco-late, or that our new boss looks a lot like Will Smith. Whe n we want to show how things are different or not alike, we contrast them. We might say that our friend Sam looks nothing like his brother Pat, or that Italian is a much harder language to learn than Spanish. Comparing and contrasting are common tech- niques in writing, too. They can be used for many reaso ns\u2014for example, to describe a character more colorfully or to provide support for an argument that the writer is making. Transitions Used to Compare and Contrast As you read the next passage, about gardeners and pare nts, notice the transitional words and phrases that indicate when the writer is comparing (showing similar it y) and when the writer is contrasting (show- ing difference). There are several transitional words and p hrases writers use to show comparison and contrast. Here are some words and phrases that can be used t o show similarity: similarly likewise like just as in the same way and also T hese words and phrases can be used to show diffe rence: on the other hand on the contrary however nevertheless conversely yet but Practice R ead the passage and answer the questions that fol low. 137137 - - reading comprehension GaRDeneRS anD pa RenTS Planting a garden is a lot like having a family. Both require a great deal of work, especially as they grow and as the seasons change. As summer days lengthen, your plants become dependent on you for sustenance, much like your children depend on you for food and drink. Like a thirsty child asking for a drink of water, your plants do the same. Their bent, wilted \"body\" language, trans - lated, issues a demand much the way your child requests milk or juice. When their collective thirsts ar e quenched, you see the way they both thrive in your care. The fussy child becomes satis- fied, and the plant reaches toward the sun in a showy display. You might also find that you have to cl ean the space around your plants much like you would pick up toys and clothes that have been left helter-skelter in your toddler's room. Similarly, plants shed spent petals, roses need to be pruned, and weeds need to be pulled. To keep children healthy, parents protect their children against disease with medicine, and gardeners do the same with insect repellent. To nourish them, parents give children vitamins, and gardeners use fertilizer, as both promote healthy growth. As children grow and become adults, they need less and less care. However, here's where the similar - ity ends. While plants die or become dormant during winter, children still maintain a vital role in the family unit. 7. In this passage, the writer compares being a pare nt to being a _________________. 8. Which of the following pairs shows a contrast, not a co mparison, between being a parent and being a gardener? a. Parents give vitamins to children to keep them health y; gardeners give fertilizer to their plants to keep them healthy. b. Parents pick up toys and clothes in their childr en's room; gardeners pull up weeds around their plants. c. Children remain an important part of the family aft er they grow up; plants die or become dormant after the growing season ends. d. Children ask parents for milk or juice when they ar e thirsty; plants bend or wilt when they need water, showing gardeners that they are thirsty. Reading More Closely As you practice more and more with reading pas-sages, you will begin to notice how specic sentences or paragraphs relate to each other and to the passage as a whole. When you are aware of how an author has structured his or her writing, it will help you under - stand the writer's meaning even better. Structure, wo rd choice, description, and detail all give shape to a text and affect its meaning. The following excerpt is from the speech that John F. Kennedy gave when he was sworn in as presi- dent in 1961. 138138 - - reading comprehension eXCeRpT speech are six paragraphs that all begin with the same The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abol-ish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolution- ary beliefs for which our forebears fought ar e still at issue around the globe\u2014the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state, but from the hand of God. As you read this passage closely, you should pay atten- tion to certain words or phrases and how they build on ea ch other. The phrase mortal hands has a more powerful meaning than if the word mortal was not included. Words such as revolutionary beliefs and forebears rein- force Kennedy's appeal to the audience to make a co nnection with the birth of the nation. The structure and word choice of the passage affe ct its tone and meaning and support Kennedy's purpose to inspire his audience. Later on in the pattern: T o those old allies whose cultural and spiritual orig ins we share. . . . To those new States whom we welcome to the ranks of the free. . . .

To that world assembly of sovereign states. . . . Finally, to those nations who would make them - selves our adversary. . . .

It is impos - sible to be certain even of mine. Yet I believe that I know my tangible desideratum. It is a tree-top against a patch of sky. If I should lie crippled or long ill, or should have the quite conceivable mis- fortune to be clapped in jail, I could survive, I think, given this one token of the physical world. I kn ow that I lived on one such in my first days at the Creek. The tree was a magnolia, taller than the tallest orange trees around it. There is no such thing in the world as an ugly tree, but the magnolia grandiflora has a unique perfection. No matter how crowded it may be, no matter how thickly holly and live oak and sweet gum may grow up around it, it develops with complete symmetry, so that one wonders whether character in all things, human as well as vegetable, may not be implicit. Neither is its development ruthless, achieved at the expense of its neighbors, for it is one of the few trees that may be allowed to stand in an orange grove, seeming to steal nothing from the expensively nourished citrus. The young of the tree is courteous, waiting for the parent to be done with life before presuming to take it over. There are never seedling magnolias under or near an old magnolia. When the tree at last dies, the young glossy sprouts appear from nowhere, exulting in the sun and air for which they may have waited a long hundred years. The tree is beautiful the year around. It need not wait for a brief burst of blooming to justify it self, like the wild plum and the hawthorn. It is handsomer than most dressed only in its broad leaves, shining like dark polished jade, so that when I am desperate for decoration, I break a few sprays for the house and find them an ornament of which a Japanese artist would approve. The tree sheds some of its leaves just before it blooms, as though it shook off old garments to be cleansed and ready for the new. There is a dry pattering to earth of the hard leaves and for a brief time the tree is parched and drawn, the rosy-lichened trunk gray and anxious. Then pale green spires cover the boughs, unfolding into freshly lacquered leaves, and at their tips the blooms appear. When, in late April or early May, the pale buds unfold into great white waxy blossoms, sometimes eight or ten inches across, and the perfume is a delirious thing on the spring air, I would not trade one tree for a conservatory filled with orchids. The blooms, for all their size and thickness, are as delicate as orchids in that they reject the touch of human hands. They must be cut or broken carefully and placed in a jar of water without brushing the edges, or the creamy pet - als will turn in an hour to brown velvet. Properly handled, they open in the house as on the tree, th e cupped buds bursting open suddenly, the full-blown flowers shedding the red-tipped stamens in a shower, so that in a quiet room you hear them sifting onto the table top. The red seed cones are as fine as candles. They mature slowly from the top of the tree down, as a Christmas tree is lighted. 140140 - - reading comprehension 10. a. b. c. d. 9.

Just as in spo-ken conversation, where you have many ways to com-municate what you are thinking\u2014through a joke, a sto ry, even a facial expression\u2014writers have many techniques to communicate with their readers. Text with layers of meaning is often more color - ful, more convincing, more emotional, or more meaningful than text that simply spells out what the author is trying to say in a clear, factual way. It's important to try to pick up on a writer's cl ues, just as, for example, you would pick up on a look of disappointment when a friend says, \"That's ne.\" You immediately recognize that your friend does not really think that whatever happened is ne. This section describes the techniques that writers use\u2014many of which you probably have already picked up on\u2014and how to identify them. Interpreting Specific Words On the GED\u00ae RLA test, you may be asked to gure out the denition of vocabulary words by looking at their context\u2014the words and meanings that sur - round the vocabulary words. For an example of how to do this, read the fol- lowing paragraph about one of the nation's favorite pastimes. ReaLITY Tv Most reality TV shows center on two com - mon motivators: fame and money. The sh ows transform waitresses, hairdressers, investment bankers, counselors, and teach-ers, to name a few, from obscure figures to ho usehold names. A lucky few successfully parlay their 15 minutes of fame into celeb-rity. Even if you are not interested in fame, yo u can probably understand the desire for lots of money. Watching people eat large insects, reveal their innermost thoughts to millions of people, and allow themselves to be filmed 24 hours a day for a huge finan-cial reward seems to have mass appeal for vi ewers. Whatever their attraction, these shows are among the most popular on tele-vision, and every season, they proliferate like weeds in an untended garden. The net- works are quickly replacing more traditional dramas and comedies with reality TV pro- grams, which earn millions of dollars in ad vertising revenue. Whether you love it or hate it, one thing is for sure\u2014reality TV is here to stay! One of the more difcult words in the paragraph is obscure. With a little detective work, we can deter - mine the denition of that word by looking at how it 141141 - - reading comprehension is used in the paragraph. Let's look at the context in which it appears: The shows transform waitresses, hairdressers, investment bankers, counselors, and teachers, to name a few, from obscure gures to household names. Gi ven the sentence, what can we tell about obscur e? Well, since the shows transform waitresses, hairdress-ers, investment bankers, counselors, and teachers from one position\u2014obscure gures\u2014to another position\u2014household names\u2014that immediately tells us that an obscure gure and a household name are two different things. Furthermore, we know from the sentence that the pe ople in question are involved in typical, every- day jobs (waitresses, hairdressers, bankers, etc.) and that fro m this position, they are transformed into household names, which means they achieve some level of fame and notoriety. Now you can take a pretty good guess at the meaning of obscure. Before they become household names, the wait- resses, hairdressers, investment bankers, counselors, and teac hers are A. famous and notorious. B. unknown and undistinguished. C. unique and distinctive. The correct answer, of course, is B. I t certainly can't be A, because we know that these people are not yet famous. The reality shows will make them famous, but until that happens, they remain obscure. Answer C doesn't really make sense because we know from the passage that these people are waitresses, hair - dressers, investment bankers, counselors, and teach-ers. Now, these are all very respectable jobs, but they are fair ly common, so they wouldn't be described as unique or distinctive. Furthermore, we can tell that B is the correct answer because we can substitute the word obscure with the word unknown or undistin- guished in the sentence and both would make sense. How Much Context Do You Need? In the previous example, you would still be able to understand the main message of the passage even if you didn't know\u2014or couldn't gure out\u2014the mean-ing of obscure. In some cases, however, your under - standing o f a passage depends on your understanding of a particular word or phrase. Can you understand the following sentence, for example, without know-ing what adversely means? Reality TV shows will adversely affect traditional dramas and comedies. W hat does adve rsely mean in this sentence? Is it something good or bad? As good a detective as you may be, there simply aren't enough clues in this sen-tence to tell you what this word means. But a passage with mo re information will give you what you need to determine meaning from context. Reality TV shows will adversely affect traditional dramas and comedies. As reality TV increases in popularity, network executives will begin cancel-ing more traditional dramas and comedies and replacing them with the latest in reality TV. I n the passage, adve rsely most nearly means A. mildly, slightly. B. kindly, gently. C. negatively, unfavorably. D. immediately, swiftly. The correct answer is C, ne gatively, unfavorably. The passage provides clues that allow you to determine the meaning of adversely . It tells you that as reality TV becomes more popular, network executives will can-cel more traditional dramas and comedies and 142142 - - reading comprehension replace them with reality TV programming. So the meaning of adversely is neither A, mildly, slightly, nor B, kindly, gently. And based on the passage, you can't really tell if these changes will be immediate or swift (D) because the sentence doesn't say anything about the e xact time frame in which these changes will occur. Remember, good detectives don't make assumptions they can't support with facts; and there are no facts in this sentence to support the assump-tion that changes will occur immediately. Thus, C is the best answ er choice. You may also have noticed that adv ersely is very similar to adversary. And if you know that an adver - sary is a hostile opponent or enemy, then you know that ad versely cannot be something positive. Or if you know the word adversity\u2014hardship or misfortune\u2014 then you know that adversely must mean something negative or difcult. All these words share the same root, advers-. Only the endings change. Connotative Meaning Authors use words in certain ways to help them describe characters or events and create a particular mood or tone. The connotative meaning of a word is its sug- gested meaning, as opposed to the literal or exact def-inition. For instance, if you are angry with someone and r efer to him or her as a \"rat,\" you are suggesting that the person is mean or disgraceful, not an actual rodent. Writers use gurat ive language to create images with words and express ideas in creative ways. Figura-tive devices include metaphors and similes. Metaphors Before we explain what it is, look at this example of a metap hor: Janie was the heart of the organization: all ideas came from her and circulated back to her for her feedback. H ere the heart is a metaphor\u2014Janie was not literally a human heart, but she acted as a heart at the organiza-tion. All ideas flowed through her, just as blood is pumpe d out from and flows back to the heart in the human body. A metaphor is a word or phrase for one thing that the writer uses to refer to another thing, showing that they are similar. Here is another example: His smile is a ray of sunshine that makes people feel happy, no matter how down they are. Of course, the smile is not literally made of sunshine. The writer is using the metaphor ray of sunshine to express the positive effect of the person's smile on the people around him. Similes Similes are similar to metaphors, but they use the w ords like or as. For example: His smile is like a ray of sunshine. My puppy Waldo is as sweet as a teddy bear. Running errands for my boss is as much fun as going to the dentist. H ere's a fourth example, which you may have even notic ed when you read the very descriptive paragraph from the short story \"A Rose for Emily,\" earlier in the course: Her eyes, lost in the fatty ridges of her face, looked like two small pieces of coal pressed into a lump of dough as they moved from one face to another while the visitors stated their errand. A Closer Look at Figurative Language In some passages, the use of gurative language can be much more complicated than in the sentences in 143143 - - reading comprehension the preceding section, but if you break it down, you'll see the hidden meaning. This passage from John F. Kennedy's 1961 inaugural a ddress uses gurative language to dis- cuss sophisticated ideas with the audience. In the seco nd paragraph, reprinted here, you can see sev- eral examples. eXCeRpT We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans\u2014born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage\u2014and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world. Let's look at the rst sentence: We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that rst re volution. By using the word heirs , President Kennedy commu- nicates a deep sense of obligation to the American public list ening to him. Hearing that word makes an audience think of family history and connection. Now, let's look at the second sentence: Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and f oe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans\u2014born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heri-tage\u2014and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has al w ays been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world. In this (very long) sentence, the image of a flame in the to rch suggests the power and intensity of Kenne- dy's call to action. The metaphor gains even more intensit y and atmosphere from the image of an Olympic marathon\u2014the torch has been passed\u2014in which a runner literally passes a lighted torch to the next runner in the relay team. Tone Tone is the mood or attitude conveyed in writing. Even in passages that may seem very straightforward, good writers are very careful about the exact words they choose and the style of their language. Consider another excerpt from the earlier arti- cle \"Four Simple Tips to Help You Land a Great Job.\" eXCeRpT If you're among the more than 1.5 million college grads looking for work this year, you will need to work smarter to stand above the crowd and land that dream job or internship. As you probably picked up, the language is direct and simple. The author speaks directly to you, the reader. The writing is informal, but it grabs you right away with action and purpose (note the phrase land a great job in the title, for example). In the sentence, the phrase stand above the crowd is an example of gura- tive language\u2014the writer is not telling you to literally stand talle r than other people in a crowd. But even though it is gurative, it is not poetic or emotional, as the gurative language in President Kennedy's inau-gural speech is. 144144 - - reading comprehension As you can see from these two excerpts, good writers use a tone that is appropriate to their purpose. The inaugural speech uses language to inspire listen-ers to action in the name of higher goals, while the guide for job seekers uses a more personal and direct style to offer advice for nding work. Point of View and Purpose Figuring out an author's point of view and purpose is important to understanding the meaning of a pas-sage. The author's point of view can be described as his o r her attitude toward a subject. An author's pur - pose is the reason for writing about a specic topic. Sometimes a writer chooses to tell a story through the ey es of someone completely outside the action of the story. Other times, a character within the story is tell-ing it. You can identify an author's viewpoint based on passage details, vocabulary, and word choice, as well as the author's background. This last element can be challenging because it may require not only knowl-edge about the author but also some background info rmation about the time period in which the pas- sage was written and what important events hap-pened then. eXCeRpTe D FRo M Ma RJoRIe KInnan Ra WLInGS'S CROSS CREEK, a MeMo IR aBo UT LIFe on a FLoRIDa oR anGe GRove (1942) I see no reason for denying so fundamental an urge, ruin or no. It is more important to live the life one wishes to live, and to go down with it if necessary, quite contentedly, than to live more profit - ably but less happily. Yet to achieve content under sometimes adverse circumstances requires first an adjustment within oneself, and this I had already made, and after that, a recognition that one is not unique in being obliged to toil and struggle and suffer. This is the simplest of all facts and the most difficult for the individual ego to accept. A close reading of this passage requires that you rst pay attention to the year in which it was pub-lished\u20141942. What signicant events happened in the U nited States around this time? The nation was recovering from the Great Depression and had just entered World War II. Rawlings is writing about the years before this, but it is important to know that these events were happening because they may shape the viewpoint of the author. In this excerpt, Rawlings talks about living the life one wants to live, even if it means suffering dif-culties, instead of having more money but being less happ y. She acknowledges that the struggle she faced was not really unique\u2014everyone experiences dif-culties. Rawlings implies that complaining about one 's lot in life is a waste of time. This summarizes her point of view, which may have been shaped not only by her personal experiences but by what was happening in society at this time. What might be Rawlings's purpose for writing Cr oss Creek? Based on her style and viewpoint, the reader can conclude that she wanted to provide read- 145145 - - reading comprehension ers with a glimpse of life in a Southern community, including its challenges and imperfections.

I was fitted by temperament and by inheritance for farm and country living, yet to take it up after some thirty years of urban life was not too easy. I had known my maternal grandfather's Michigan farm, but there I was both guest and child, and the only duties were to gather the eggs from the sweet-smelling hayloft. I had known my father's Maryland farm, but that farm was his love, his escape from Washington govern - mental routine, and we lived there only in the too few summers. I had no duties there at all. There wa s only delight; the flowering locust grove; the gentle cows in pasture; Rock Creek, which ran, ten miles away from its Washington park, at the foot of the hill of the locusts, where my brother and I learned to swim and to fish for tiny and almost untakable fishes; long walks with my father through the woods where he hoped someday to build a home; jaunts with him behind Old Dan in the carriage, to the county seat of Rockville, or to buy mules at Frederick. These things got in the blood but were no preparation for running a farm oneself. When I bought the Florida orange grove with my inheritance that represented my share of th e Maryland farm, my father's sister Madeline wrote me in lament. \"You have in you,\" she said, \"that fatal drop of Pearce blood, clamoring for change and adventure, and above all, for a farm. I never knew a Pearce who didn't secretly long for a farm. Mother had one, Uncle Pierman was ruined by one, there was your father's tragic experience. I had one, once.\" I see no reason for denying so fundamental an urge, ruin or no. It is more important to live the life one wishes to live, and to go down with it if necessary, quite contentedly, than to live more profitably but less hap-pily. Yet to achieve content under sometimes adverse circumstances requires first an adjustment wi thin oneself, and this I had already made, and after that, a recognition that one is not unique in being obliged to toil and struggle and suffer. This is the simplest of all facts and the most difficult for the individual ego to accept. As I look back on those first difficult times at the Creek, when it seemed as though the actual labor was more than I could bear, and the making of a living on the grove impossible, it was Martha who drew aside a curtain and led me in to the company of all those who had loved the Creek and been tormented by it. 146146 - - reading comprehension 11. 12. 13. 14. M adeline's attitude toward the writer's decision to pur chase the farm could best be described as a. nostalgic for days gone by. b. enthusiastic but concerned. c. understanding but foreboding. d. indifferent. The passage suggests which of the following abou t the writer's decision to purchase the farm in Cross Creek? a. She deeply regretted her decision because of the amount of work required to run the farm. b. She was ready to separate from her do mineering family and live on her own on the farm. c. She was enthusiastic about owning the farm and app reciated the experiences that prepared her for this endeavor. d. She had a deep desire for rural life and knew she must full l this longing to be truly happy. In the last sentence, the Cr eek refers to a. a farm in Michigan. b. an orange grove in Florida. c. Rock Creek, ten miles from Washington, DC. d. a farm in Maryland. The phrase it was Martha who drew aside a cur - tain is a metaphor that could be best inter - preted as a. Martha opened the curtains of the author's house, l ling it with sunlight. b. Martha gave the author clarity by offering an inside p erspective. c. Martha alleviated some of the author's bur den at the Creek by opening the curtains and doing other household tasks. d. none of the above.

FDa WIDenS LooK aT a RSenIC In appLe JUICe Some consumers are understandably surprised to learn that arsenic is present in water, air, and soil, and as a result, it can be found in certain foods and beverages, including apple juice and juice con - centrates. Arsenic is present in the environment as a naturally occurring substance and also as a resu lt of contamination from human activity, such as past use of fertilizers and arsenic-based pesti - cides, which may still be in the soil, explains Donald Zink, PhD, senior science adviser at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition. \"While envi- ronmental contaminants like arsenic are unavoidable in food,\" says Zink, \"the goal is to keep the levels of arsenic that people consume over the course of their lives as low as possible.\" That's where the FDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) come in. Their job is t o monitor food and the environment and take action when needed to protect the American public. The FDA has been testing and monitoring fruit juices, including apple juice, for arsenic content for more than 20 years, says Michael R. Taylor, the FDA's deputy commissioner for foods. \"We are confident in the overall safety of apple juice consumed in this country because we con-tinue to find that apple juice, on average, contains low amounts of arsenic.\" In fact, the FDA's most recent tests done in 2010 and 2011 show on average about three par ts of arsenic in every one billion parts of apple juice. That is lower than the 10 parts per billion (ppb) set by the EPA as the maximum level allowed in public drinking water. \"Our test results over many years support the overall safety of apple juice,\" says Taylor, \"but we s ee a small percentage of individual samples tested that contain higher levels of arsenic. We want to minimize the public's exposure to arsenic in foods as much as we can.\" For that reason, the FDA plans to consider all the relevant evidence, and based on this work, it may set a guidance or other maximum level to further reduce arsenic in apple juice and juice products. To further protect the public's health, the FDA is also taking the following actions: n Enhancing its surveillance of arsenic in apple juice and juice concentrate. The agency will shortly have results for an additional 90 samples of apple juice and juice concentrate and soon after will sample additional types of juice and juice concentrates. n Continuing to test samples of apple juice imported into the United States from China. The most recent results included more than 70 samples from China, and 95% of these con- tained less than the 10 ppb level used for drinking water. n Working with the EPA to coordinate the review of the risk assessment being prepared and discussing other steps the two agencies can take to reduce the overall levels of arsenic in the environment and in foods. The bottom line is that the FDA is working hard to ensure the safety of the foods people consume and to do so based on the best science. And the best thing families can do is to con-sume a variety of foods and beverages and follow a well-balanced diet consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. 148148 - - reading comprehension 2. 1.

Roe Fort Lyon, Colorado Territory, October 1871. After months of anticipation and days of weary travel we have at last got to our army home! As you know, Fort Lyon is fifty miles from Kit Carson, and we came all that distance in a funny looking stage coach called a \"jerkey,\" and a good name for it, too, for at times it seesawed back and forth and then sideways, in an awful breakneck way. The day was glorious, and the atmosphere so clear, we could see miles and miles in every direction. But there was not one object to be seen on the vast rolling plains\u2014not a tree or a house, except the wretched ranch and stockade where we got fresh horses and a perfectly uneatable dinner. It was dark when we reached the post, so of course we could see nothing that night. General and Mrs. Phillips gave us a most cordial welcome\u2014just as though they had known us always. Din- ner was served soon after we arrived, and the cheerful dining room, and the table with its dainty ch ina and bright silver, was such a surprise\u2014so much nicer than anything we had expected to find here, and all so different from the terrible places we had seen since reaching the plains. General Phillips is not a real general\u2014only so by brevet, for gallant service during the war. I was so disap-pointed when I was told this, but Faye says that he is very much afraid that I will have cause, so oner or later, to think that the grade of captain is quite high enough. He thinks this way because, having graduated at West Point this year, he is only a second lieutenant just now, and General Phillips is his captain and company commander. It seems that in the Army, lieutenants are called \"Mister\" always, but all other officers must be addressed by their rank. At least that is what they tell me. But in Faye's company, the captain is called general, and the first lieutenant is called major, and as this is most confusing, I get things mixed sometimes. Most girls would. A soldier in uniform waited upon us at dinner, and that seemed so funny. I wanted to watch him all the time, which distracted me, I suppose, for once I called General Phillips \"Mister\"! It so happened, too, that just that instant there was not a sound in the room, so everyone heard the blunder. General Phillips straightened back in his chair, and his little son gave a smothered giggle\u2014for which he should have been sent to bed at once. But that was not all! That soldier, who had been so dignified and stiff, put his hand over his mouth and fairly rushed from the room so he could laugh outright. And how I longed to run some place, too\u2014but not to laugh, oh, no! These soldiers are not nearly as nice as one would suppose them to be, when one sees them dr essed up in their blue uniforms with bright brass buttons. And they can make mistakes, too, for yesterday, when I asked that same man a question, he answered, \"Yes, Sorr!\" Then I smiled, of course, but he did not seem to have enough sense to see why. When I told Faye about it, he looked vexed and said I must never laugh at an enlisted man\u2014that it was not dignified in the wife of an officer to do so. And then I told him that an officer should teach an enlisted man not to snicker at his wife, and not to call her \"Sorr,\" which was disrespectful. I wanted to say more, but Faye suddenly left the room. (continues ) 150150 - - reading comprehension Ye sterday morning, directly after guard-mounting, Faye put on his full-dress uniform\u2014epau - lets, beautiful scarlet sash, and sword\u2014and went over to the office of the commanding officer to re port officially. The officer in command of the post is lieutenant colonel of the regiment, but he, also, is a general by brevet, and one can see by his very walk that he expects this to be remem-bered always. So it is apparent to me that the safest thing to do is to call everyone general\u2014there seem to be so many here. If I make a mistake, it will be on the right side, at least. 3.

It was a steep bank, and he paused for breath at the top, ex cusing the act to himself by looking at his watch. It was nine o'clock. There was no sun nor hint of sun, though there was not a cloud in the sky. It was a clear day, and yet there seemed an intan-gible pall over the face of things, a subtle gloom that made the day dark, and that was due to the ab sence of sun. This fact did not worry the man. He was used to the lack of sun. It had been days since he had seen the sun, and he knew that a few more days must pass before that cheerful orb, due south, would just peep above the sky line and dip immediately from view. The man flung a look back along the way he had come. The Yukon lay a mile wide and hid- den under three feet of ice. On top of this ice were as many feet of snow. It was all pure white, ro lling in gentle undulations where the ice jams of the freeze-up had formed. North and south, as far as his eye could see, it was unbroken white, save for a dark hair-line that curved and twisted from around the spruce-covered island to the south, and that curved and twisted away into the north, where it disappeared behind another spruce-covered island. This dark hair-line was the trail\u2014the main trail\u2014that led south five hundred miles to the Chilcoot Pass, Dyea, and salt water; and that led north seventy miles to Dawson, and still on to the north a thousand miles to Nulato, and finally to St. Michael on Bering Sea, a thousand miles and half a thousand more. (continues ) 151151 5. 6. - - reading comprehension But all this\u2014the mysterious, far-reaching hair-line trail, the absence of sun from the sky, the tr emendous cold, and the strangeness and weirdness of it all\u2014made no impression on the man. It was not because he was long used to it. He was a newcomer in the land, a chechaquo, and this was his first winter. The trouble with him was that he was without imagination. He was quick and alert in the th ings of life, but only in the things, and not in the significances. Fifty degrees below zero meant eighty-odd degrees of frost. Such fact impressed him as being cold and uncomfortable, and that was all. It did not lead him to meditate upon his frailty as a creature of temperature, and upon man's frailty in general, able only to live within certain narrow limits of heat and cold; and from there on it did not lead him to the conjectural field of immortality and man's place in the universe. Fifty degrees below zero stood for a bite of frost that hurt and that must be guarded against by the use of mittens, ear flaps, warm moccasins, and thick socks. Fifty degrees below zero was to him just precisely fifty degrees below zero. That there should be anything more to it than that was a thought that never entered his head.

Jones 421 Carroll Street Franklin, NY (512) 555-4390 May 22, 2014 Shanice Childress-Harris Owner Luxalot Florists, Inc. 80 River Street Franklin, NY 10821 Dear Ms. Childr ess-Harris: I a m writing to register a complaint about the floral displays that were prepared and delivered by Luxalot Florists for my son DeAndre Jones's wedding on May 18. After consulting with your assis- tant, Maurice Thomas, on February 13 and again on March 1, we thought that our desires were un derstood and that Maurice and the rest of the team had a clear plan for the wedding's floral designs. We asked for Luxalot to deliver two standing bouquets for the entrance to the chapel, one la rger standing bouquet for the altar, and 18 centerpieces for the tables at the reception. Maurice asked us what colors we preferred, and we told him that the wedding's color scheme was white, yellow, and fuchsia. He suggested that a beautiful combination in these colors would be First Snow tulips, Sunray roses, and Hot Pink ranunculus. He also wanted to add a few stems of filler flowers, such as baby's breath and Queen Anne's lace, which I thought was a good idea to reduce the overall cost. I was shocked to see a completely different combination of flowers than the one we had dis- cussed on the day of the wedding. The bouquets consisted primarily of baby's breath and Queen An ne's lace, and the other flowers were carnations, lilies, and irises. At the reception, we saw that the centerpieces had the same combination and also learned that only 14 centerpieces had been sent, so four tables were not adorned with flowers. I am writing to you to request a refund of half ($2,700) of the amount I paid for the flower di splays ($5,400). I would ask for a full refund, but the flowers that did arrive were very fresh and in the correct color scheme. I await your pr ompt response to this matter. Sincerely, Imani P .

IS Yo UR DRo WSIneSS DanGeRo US? Despite common misconceptions, anyone\u2014regardless of gender, weight, or fitness level\u2014can develop obstructive sleep apnea, a life-threatening condition characterized by episodes of com - plete or partial airway obstruction during sleep. As many as 12 million to 18 million American ad ults have untreated sleep apnea, and the experts at the American Academy of Sleep Medicine are recommending the following steps for diagnosis and treatment to significantly improve overall health, mood, and productivity. First, be aware of the risk factors. Your risk of sleep apnea increases between middle and ol der age and with the amount of excess body weight you carry. In general, men have a greater likelihood of developing the disease. However, menopause is a risk factor for sleep apnea in women. Your risk is also higher if family members have been diagnosed with sleep apnea. Smok-ing is another significant risk factor, as well as being a detriment to your overall health. In addition to these more commonly known risk factors, many people don't realize that th ey're in greater danger of developing sleep apnea if they already suffer from other common diseases. \"Seven in ten type 2 diabetics and 30% to 40% of adults with hypertension also have obstructive sleep apnea,\" says Dr. M. Safwan Badr, president of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. \"As a result, patients with these conditions should pay close attention for potential symptoms and then seek necessary treatment.\" (continues ) 154154 - - reading comprehension I t's important to watch for symptoms. While the symptom most commonly associated with sl eep apnea is snoring, not everyone who snores has the disease. However, when snoring is paired with choking, gasping, or pauses in breathing during sleep, it's a more likely indicator of sleep apnea. Sleep apnea symptoms also may appear during the daytime and include morning head-aches, excessive sleepiness, trouble concentrating, memory or learning problems, and general moodiness, irritability, or depr ession. \"Sleep apnea can make you wake up in the morning feeling tired, even though you believe yo u've had a full night of sleep,\" says Badr. \"During the day, you may feel incredibly fatigued because you're actually waking up numerous times throughout the night and your body isn't get-ting the rest it needs.\" If you suspect that you have the risk factors and symptoms of sleep apnea, it's important that yo u are evaluated by a board-certified sleep-medicine physician right away. Left untreated, sleep apnea may have a serious impact on your overall health, even increasing your risk of death. The sleep-medicine physician will have the training and expertise to diagnose your condition. He or she will conduct a thorough physical examination and sleep evaluation, asking questions like whether symptoms began when you gained weight or stopped exercising, and whether your part-ner or roommate has complained that you snore or make choking noises in your sleep. If the sleep ph ysician determines that you are at risk for obstructive sleep apnea, then you will be scheduled for a sleep study. Once diagnosed, the recommended treatment for sleep apnea is continuous positive airway pr essure (CPAP) therapy, which provides a steady stream of air through a mask to gently keep the patient's airway open throughout the night, making it easier to breathe. In patients with moderate or severe sleep apnea, it's estimated that CPAP therapy reduces the ten-year risk of heart attack by 49% and stroke by 31%. \"Treating sleep apnea provides all the benefits of improved sleep, including increased alert- ness during the day and improved memory and cognitive function,\" says Badr. \"Clinical evidence also shows that sleep apnea treatment lowers blood pressure, thus decreasing your risk of cardio- vascular disease, and improves nighttime glucose levels and insulin sensitivity among type 2 diabetics.\" \u2014Adapted from an article published on Brandpoint.com. 155155 10. 11. 12. 13. - - reading comprehension A ccording to the passage, what are some of the symp toms of sleep apnea? a. heartburn, nausea, and upper abdominal pain whe n awake b. migraines, excessive eating, and chest pain at night c. c hoking, gasping, and pauses while br eathing during sleep d. type 2 diabetes, menopause, and hy pertension Which statement best expresses the main idea of the passage? a. Sleep apnea primarily affects people with hy pertension and diabetes. b. Everyone should be aware of the risk factors and signs o f sleep apnea and get tested if there is reason for concern. c. As many as 12 million to 18 million Ame rican adults are living with sleep apnea but have not been treated. d. Sleep apnea is a condition that can be suc cessfully treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. How does the author present and develop the ke y ideas of this passage? a. by listing facts and advice related to sleep apnea b. b y presenting a chronological order of the de velopment of sleep apnea as a person ages c. by describing the differences between people who ha ve sleep apnea and those who don't d. by giving examples of patients who have be en treated successfully for sleep apnea Based on the passage, we can infer that the autho r has which of the following viewpoints? a. To accurately identify and treat sleep apnea, it' s better to see a board-certied sleep- medicine doctor than to see another type of doctor. b. The medical profession overdiagnoses sleep apnea, causing increased anxiety and irritability in patients. c. It's a shame that sleep apnea is so difcult to diagnose, leaving many Americans untreated. d. Screening for sleep apnea must be part of a pe rson's annual checkup with one's primary- care physician. 156156 - - reading comprehension answers and e xplanations Chapter Practice 1. b. The main idea of the article is that many lig htning-related tragedies can be avoided through simple precautions. This choice is a fact about lightning that does not directly relate to the idea of precautions. 2. c. This sentence best summarizes the main id ea of the article. The article goes on to explain why people were struck in the past and the pre-cautions that people can take to prevent the same tr agedies from happening in the future. 3. a. One of the ideas presented in the article is that it is b etter if people's exposure to arsenic over their lifetime is as small as possible. Although it's usually present in very small amounts, arsenic is commonly found in apple juice. You can reduce your risk altogether sim-ply by not overloading on apple juice\u2014or any one f ood or beverage, for that matter. 4. c. This is a general statement that can be inf erred from the article. The government wants to reduce the American public's exposure to arsenic, and monitoring and lowering arsenic levels in a popular drink is one way to accom-plish this. 5. b. The main idea of the article is that employ- e rs are increasingly using social media, so using social me dia and other tech tools can improve your chances of nding a job. In the third para-graph, the author states, With t echnology playing an established role in our lives and social net-works easily accessible to potential employers, establishing a st rong digital footprint and per - sonal brand is crucial to success. The writer then go es on to suggest tips for improving the way readers use e-mail and other Internet communications. 6. c. The underlying premise of the article is that ha ving strong computer-literacy skills is impor - tant during job searches. More specically, the autho r advises readers, Make sure that your online presence is up to date and also reflects your best attributes. 7. In this passage, the writer compares being a pare nt to being a gardener. Throughout the passage, the writer lists the many ways that he or she thinks being a parent is similar to being a gardener. 8. c. The last sentence of the passage points out o ne difference between being a parent and being a gardener: after parents raise their chil-dren, the children still maintain an important role in the famil y, but after gardeners raise plants, the plants die or go dormant in the garden. 9. a. The author states, The b looms, for all their size and thickness, are as delicate as orchids in that they reject the touch of human hands. 10. d. According to the author, on magnolia trees, the re is a dry pattering to earth of the hard leaves and for a brief time the tree is parched and drawn, the rosy-lichened trunk gray and anxious. Then pale green spires cover the boughs, unfold-ing into freshly lacquered leaves, and at their tips the blo oms appear. When, in late April or early May, the pale buds unfold into great white waxy blossoms, . . . the perfume is a delirious thing on the spring air. 11. c. Madeline recognizes the family instinct to o wn a farm, but she calls it \"fatal\" and mentions other family members' bad experiences. 157157 - - reading comprehension 12. d. T here are several lines in the passage that support this choice. The narrator says that she was tted by temperament . . . for farm and coun-try living and that her experiences on farms as a c hild got in the blood. Her father's sister made a similar observation: You have in you that fatal drop of Pearce blood, clamoring for change and adventure, and above all, for a farm. The narra-tor adds that I see no reason for denying so fun- damental an urge, ruin or no. It is more imp ortant to live the life one wishes to live, and to go down with it if necessary, quite contentedly, than to live more protably but less happily. 13. b. T he second paragraph starts off with a refer - ence to the Florida orange grove that the narra- tor purchases. She doesn't mention it by name at r st, but she does in the last sentence. You can also assume that the Creek is short for Cross Creek, which is the name of the book. 14. b. I n the sentence before this line, the author says that she was troubled by the hard work at the Creek and the difculty of making a living on the grove. Relief came when someone named Martha drew aside a curtain and wel- comed her into the group of people who had a hist ory with the farm. This implies that by pull- ing back the curtain, Martha was clearing up so me of the writer's confusion or angst by shar - ing information about the grove in the past. Reading Comprehension Review 1. b. T he rst paragraph states that arsenic is pres-ent in the environment as a naturally occurring s ubstance. We can infer that it is hazardous\u2014or hurtful\u2014to people's health because it is referred to as a contaminant. Another important reason is because ofcials are trying to keep apple juice safe by making sure that arsenic levels are very low; that implies that arsenic at higher levels makes food unsafe. 2. c. T he term parts per billion (ppb) is mentioned in the third paragraph in the same context\u2014 discussing the amount of arsenic found in drinks. 3. c. T here are several clues throughout the letter that Faye is Frances's husband, but the biggest one appears in the fourth paragraph: When I told Faye about it, he looked vexed and said I must never laugh at an enlisted man\u2014that it was not dignied in the wife of an ofcer to do so. And then I told him that an ofcer should teach an enlisted man not to snicker at his wife, and not to call her \"Sorr,\" which was disrespectful. I wanted to say more, but Faye suddenly left the room. We can infer that this was a private disagreement between a husband and a wife. Faye thought that Frances had not acted like a dignied wife, but Frances said that Faye should have stood up for her: I told him that an ofcer should teach an enlisted man not to snicker at his wife, and not to call her \"Sorr,\" which was disrespectful. Faye may have taken this comment personally, because he suddenly left the room. 4. d. She se ems interested in the ins and outs of army protocol\u2014she describes details and tries to gure out the rules of rank\u2014but she also questions why things are as they are. 158158 - - reading comprehension 5. c. The writer hints at this point when he notes that all this\u2014the mysterious, far-reaching hair - line trail, the absence of sun from the sky, the tre- mendous cold, and the strangeness and weirdness of it all\u2014made no impression on the man. The ideas presented in the last paragraph also sup-port this theme. 6. b. Although the writer criticizes the man for not thinking d eeply about his circumstances and about life in general, the man does seem knowledgeable. He knows about the path of the sun, he knows the exact temperature, and it's suggested that he knows the exact path of the trail he is on. Matter-of-fact is also a good description for the man. There are many rea-sons to think that the man focuses on the world around him in a st raightforward way. For example, the writer notes that He was quick and alert in the things of life, but only in the things, and not in the signicances. The last three sen-tences of the passage offer further evidence that he is matte r-of-fact. 7. c. The letter writer is indeed submitting her c omplaint to the owner of Luxalot and writing it in a formal way. The word register has many meanings. One of them is a machine that calcu-lates and holds money at a store (cash register), bu t that doesn't make sense in this sentence. We are looking for a different meaning of the word register. Also note that in the sentence, register is used as a verb, whereas a machine that calcu-lates and holds money at a store is a noun. Re gistrar means an ofcial record keeper (for instance, the person at a school or college who keeps records and helps to sign up students for classes). Finally, the letter writer is presenting her complaint to the owner of Luxalot and wants the owner to take action. She is not with-drawing, or removing, her complaint. 8. b. The word is used in the statement that the w edding's color scheme was white, yellow, and fuchsia. Then, in the next sentence, the writer mentions the types of flowers that would t that combination of colors: First Snow tulips, Sunray roses, and Hot Pink ranunculus. We can deduce that First Snow tulips are white flowers (because snow is white), that Sunray roses are yellow flowers (because the sun is yellow), and that Hot Pink ranunculus are fuchsia-colored flowers. Fuchsia probably means hot\u2014or bright\u2014pink. 9. d. This is not a reason why the writer is dissat- ise d. At the end of the letter, she explains, I wo uld ask for a full refund, but the flowers that did arrive were . . . in the correct color scheme. Choice a is a reason why the writer is dissatis-ed. She mentions that the original plan was to use a f ew stems of ller flowers, such as baby's breath and Queen Anne's lace, which I thought was a good idea to reduce the overall cost. We can assume that baby's breath and Queen Anne's lace are inexpensive flowers because Mrs. Jones calls them ller flowers and because if they are used, the cost goes down. Then, on the day of the wedding, The bouquets consisted primarily of baby's breath and Queen Anne's lace\u2014not a few stems, as had been discussed. This all adds up to mean that the displays contained too many inexpensive flowers. Choice b is an incorrect choice because the writer says that the plan was to use mainly tulips, roses, and ranunculus. Instead, the company delivered mainly baby's breath and Queen Anne's lace, and the other flowers were carnations, lilies, and irises. Choice c is an incorrect choice because she says that she ordered 18 centerpieces, but only 14 were delivered. 159159 - - reading comprehension 10. c. All three of these symptoms are listed in the ar ticle as possible signs that a person suffers from sleep apnea. Migraines are a type of head- ache, and the article does mention that head-aches could be a symptom, but it species morning headaches. Also, the article does not mention excessive eating or chest pains as signs of sleep apnea. (Sleep apnea may cause heart attacks\u2014which can cause a person to feel chest pain\u2014but that does not mean that chest pain is a sign of sleep apnea.) Choice d is incorrect because each of these is mentioned as a risk fac-tor for developing sleep apnea\u2014people who hav e type 2 diabetes or hypertension or who are going through menopause may be more likely to develop sleep apnea, but this doesn't mean that these conditions are symptoms of having sleep apnea. (If you don't quite understand this point, consider this everyday example: Standing outside in the freezing rain would be a risk fac-tor for getting a cold. The symptoms of having inde ed come down with a cold would be coughing, sneezing, and a runny nose.) 11. b. The writer starts off by saying that anyone\u2014 r egardless of gender, weight, or tness level\u2014can develop obstructive sleep apnea, which suggests that everyone should be knowledgeable about the condition. At different points in the article, the author also states: First, be aware of the risk factors; It's important to watch for symptoms; and If you suspect that you have the risk factors and symptoms of sleep apnea, it's important that you are evaluated by a board-certied sleep-medicine physician right away. Choice a is incorrect because although, according to the article, a large portion of people who have hypertension and type 2 also have sleep apnea, that does not mean that sleep apnea primarily affects people with those conditions. In fact, the rst para-graph of the article stresses that anyone can de velop sleep apnea. Choices c and d are not main ideas of the passage. 12. a. The author presents facts about the symp- t oms, diagnosis, and treatment of sleep apnea, and ad vises readers to pay attention to risk fac- tors and symptoms and to get tested if they think they ma y have sleep apnea. Chronological means ordered by time from start to nish, as in a time line. The author does not discuss the development of sleep apnea over time. The author also does not discuss specic people who have sleep apnea. 160160 - - reading comprehension 13. a. This choice is supported by these sentences in the ar ticle: If you suspect that you have the risk factors and symptoms of sleep apnea, it's important that you are evaluated by a board-cer - tied sleep-medicine physician right away. . . . The sleep-me dicine physician will have the train- ing and expertise to diagnose your condition. He or she wil l conduct a thorough physical examina- tion . . . The author emphasizes the skill of b oard-certied sleep-medicine doctors when it comes to sleep apnea, never mentions other types of doctors (here or elsewhere in the arti-cle), and encourages readers to visit a board-ce rtied sleep-medicine doctor if they think they may have sleep apnea. All of this suggests that when it comes to sleep apnea, the author probably thinks that it is better to see a board-certied sleep-medicine doctor than to see another type of doctor. Choice b is incorrect because overdiagnosis is not mentioned or implied in the article. Instead, the author dis-cusses sleep-medicine doctors' ability to diag-nose sleep apnea accurately. Choice c is inco rrect because the author does not say or imply that sleep apnea is difcult to diagnose. Instead, one of the big messages of the article is that many people with sleep apnea are going untreated simply because they've never asked to be screened in the rst place. The author does not imply choice d in the article. 161161 TESTPREP_07RLA_125-162.indd 162 3/31/15 4:55 PM chapter7 LanguagE and grammar Many of the questions on the GED\u00ae RLA exam are designed to test your knowledge of grammar, word usage, and language mechanics. Make sure you are prepared by carefully reviewing this chapter and answering the practice questions. Answers and explanations for all practice questions are at the end of the chapter. Frequently Confused Words and Homonyms Quick\u2014what's the difference between it's and its? Know and no? To and too ? Like many words in the English language, these words often confuse people because they sound the same bu t have very different meanings. Other frequently confused words have the same spelling but different mean- ings. All of these are called homonyms. To help avoid confusion on the GED\u00ae test\u2014and in everyday life\u2014familiarize yourself with the following homo nyms and other words (such as affect and effect) that people often mix up. 163 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR Words to Remember affect/effect Here are the two denitions of affec t and effect that people often confuse: to affect (verb): to influence Er ic's childhood in rural Arkansas affected how he viewed the world. effect (noun): the result of influence Eric's childhood in rural Arkansas had an effect on how he viewed the world. B oth words also have other meanings, which you should tr y not to confuse: t o effect (v erb): to cause something to happen, accomplish Over time, the union's efforts effected change at the factory. to affect (verb): to pretend or make a display of The designer sometimes affec ted a British accent when he went to parties, which was ridiculous because he had been born and raised in New Jersey. affect (noun): a feeling or emotion, or the way that a feeling or emotion is expressed physically H e had a calm, cool affect, which was dis - turbing because his son had just go ne missing. its/it's its : belonging to a certain animal or thing The dog wants its bone. it's: the contraction of it is It's too hot to go outside. lie/lay lie : to make an untrue statement (verb); an untr ue statement (noun) Never lie on a job application, because if the y detect the lie, you probably won't get hired. lie, lay: the present and past tenses of the verb t o lie, meaning to recline or rest in a horizon- tal p osition Every Sunday afternoon, I lie on the couch and watch movies. Last S unday afternoon, I lay on the couch and watched movies. la y, laid: the present and past tenses of the verb to lay, meaning to put something down You can lay the baby down in Sarah's old crib. He laid the baby down in Sarah's old crib. know/no; knew/new kno w: to be well informed, to recognize I know a lot about growing tomatoes. no: zero, none I have no idea how to grow tomatoes. knew: past tense of the verb to know I knew how to grow tomatoes when I was younger. new: appearing or made for the rst time I will need to buy new tomatoes. through/threw thr ough: a preposition meaning into one side and out the othe r Don't worry\u2014I know you will make it through this difcult period. thre w: past tense of the verb to throw He threw out his house keys by mistake! 164164 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR nOTE You may see the word thru in everyday life (for instance, at a fast-food restaurant's \"drive-thru\"), but it's an informal spelling that is usually not appropriate in school or work settings. You should also avoid using it on the GED \u00ae test! then/than the n: after something has happened, next First I will do my laundry, and then I will wash the kitchen floor. than: a word used when comparing two things I would rather go to Florida this winter than stay in Wisconsin.

They express the action or state of being of the subject, telling us what the subject is doing, thinking, or feeling. They also tell us when that action or state of being occurs\u2014in the past, present, or future\u2014and they can communi-cate more complicated ideas, for instance whether some thing happens often or whether there is a possi- bility that something will happen in the future. Infinitive and Simple Present Tense An innitive is the base form of the verb plus the word to, such as to go, to dream, and to eat. The inni- tive form can be used in many ways in a sentence. Here are some examples: Tong promises to return by noon. To walk was the most logical decision. One of the most common mistakes in English inv olves the innitive. People often say try and do something rather than the correct try to do some- thing. For example: I ncorrect: Tr y and come to work on time tomorrow. Correct: Try to come to work on time tomorrow. I ncorrect: I'll t ry and buy the tickets at the box ofce rather than online. Correct: I'll tr y to buy the tickets at the box ofce rather than online. This may be tested on the GED\u00ae test, so make sure you kno w the difference. Simple present tense is the verb form that com- municates facts or indicates that something occurs on a re gular basis. For example: The assistants co mmute to work on the subway, but their boss takes a limo. 165165 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR I commute to work every morning on the subway. She sp eaks English. I am from Philadelphia. Dogs bark, and cats meow. In the Caribbean, the water is aqua blue. Marissa runs ve miles every weekend. The simple present tense of regular verbs is formed as follow s, using the verb to drive as an example: SinguL ar PLuraL First person (i/we) Base form (drive) Base form (drive) Second person(you) Base form (drive) Base form (drive) Third person (he/she/they) Base form plus -s or -es(drives) Base form (drive) Present Continuous Tense Present continuous tense is the verb form that describes what is happening now, at this exact moment. It ends in -ing and is accompanied by one of the following helping verbs: am, is, or are (the pres- ent tense of the verb to be). For instance: Adam is driving to the fair. They are driving to the picnic. Gerunds Words that end in -ing don' t always function as verbs. Sometimes they act as nouns and are called gerunds. They can also function as adjectives. Examples: Tracy enjoys running on the beach. Here, running serves as a noun\u2014it is the thing that Tracy enjoys. The lo ading dock is outside the back door. Here, loading serves as an adjective\u2014it describes the dock. He re is an example of how the same word can have three diff e rent functions: verb: He is scr eaming loudly. gerund (noun): That screaming is driving me crazy. adjective: The screaming boy nally stopped. Whe n correcting sentences on the GED\u00ae RLA test, do not assume that a word that ends in -ing is a verb. You will need to read closely to determine how the word functions in the sentence. Here are a few guidelines for identifying and using gerunds: 1. Gerunds are often used after a preposition. Keza thought that by taking the train she would save money and time. Noriel was afraid of offending her host, but she couldn't eat dinner. 2. Gerunds frequently follow these verbs: admit dislik e practice avoid enjoy put off appreciate escape quit can't help nish recall consider imagine resist delay keep risk deny miss suggest discuss postpone tolerate We sho uld discuss buying a new computer. I quit smoking. Past Tense Simple past tense is the verb form that expresses what happened at a specic moment in the past. It rained for three hours yesterday. She opened the door and welcomed the guests. 166166 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR Past Continuous Tense The past continuous tense indicates that an action happened in the past and continued for some time. It's used with the helping verb was or were . S he was walking when the rain started. While they were singing, the phone rang. Past Perfect Tense Used with the helping verb had, the past perfect tense indicates that an action happened in the past before another action happened in the past. This may sound confusing, but it's a tense that you probably often use in everyday speech. Look at these examples: Yesterday, Theresa told me that she thought Harr y had played too much golf during their honeymoon. Notice that the sentence places us at one point in time\u2014whe n Theresa was talking and thinking\u2014and it uses the past perfect to look back at an earlier point in time, when something may have happened during her honeymoon. Jack's vacation was cut short when he broke his ankle in London, b ut he had had the time of his life in Paris. In this sentence, we're placed at the time when Jack's vacat ion was cut short, and we're looking back at the time when he enjoyed himself in Paris. Aisling's parents had always wanted her to become a doc tor, but in college she decided to become an English major. The time that Aisling's parents wanted her to become a do ctor happened before the time that she decided to become an English major. Past Perfect and the Conditional On the GED\u00ae test, you may be asked to use the past per fect in another situation: conditional sentences set in the past. You probably use the conditional all the time in eve ryday life without knowing it. It follows this gen- eral pattern: If this happens, then that happens. Look at these examples: I will go inside if you tell me to. If y ou don't know where those cookies came from, you shouldn't eat them. N ow look at these examples of conditional sentences set in the past. T hey all include the past perfect: I would have brought sunscreen if I had known it was going t o be so hot and sunny. If you had really wanted to keep that job, you would have gotten to work on time. If someone had called to tell me that the doctor's ofce was closed, I would have stayed in bed. Conditional sentences in the past often include the words would have. nOTE Regular versus Irregular Verbs Most English verbs are regular\u2014they follow a stan- dard set of rules for forming the simple past tense. Usual ly, add -ed . H e interrupted me when I was typing. If the verb ends with the letter e, just add -d. The prisoners escaped. 167167 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR If the verb ends with the letter y, change the y to an i and add -ed. I carried the water pitcher to the table. Irregular Verbs About 150 English verbs are irregular\u2014they don't fol low the standard rules for changing tense. Many irregular verbs form the past tense by chang ing the vowel to a. For example: Present Simple Past begin began sing sang spring sprang come came overcome overcame run ran O ther irregular verbs are more \"irregular,\" such as these be low: Present bite bring dig hear leave plead send Simple Past bit brought dug heard left pled sent I n English, as in many other languages, the essential ver b, to be, is highly irregular: Subject Present Simple Past I am was you are were he, she, it is was we are were they are were Using a Consistent Tense A common writing mistake is to jump between verb tenses when it is not necessary or correct to do so. You may be asked to spot this mistake on the GED\u00ae RLA test. If a writer indicates that a certain action takes plac e at a certain time, he or she should be consistent in the use of verb tense when writing about that action elsewhere in the sentence (or paragraph or story). Review the following examples: I ncorrect: She le ft the house and forgets her keys in the kitchen. Correct: She left the house and forgot her keys in the kitchen. I ncorrect: Jon sig ned up to run the marathon, but after talking to his doctor, he decides it would be too strenuous. Correct: Jon sig ned up to run the marathon, but after talking to his doctor, he decided it would be too strenuous. Subject-Verb Agreement In grammar, agreement means that verbs should agree with their subjects. If the subject is singular, the verb should be singular. If the subject is plural, the verb should be plural. Because we often use incorrect grammar when we speak, identifying correct subject- verb agreement can be challenging. Read the following examples, which highlight co mmon agreement errors: Incorrect: The president, along with his wife and t wo daughters, are going to Hawaii on vacation. Correct: The president , along with his wife and two daughters, is going to Hawaii on vacation. Although we know that four people are going on va cation\u2014the president, his wife, and their two daughters\u2014the sentence really has only one subject: 168168 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR the president. The phrase along with his wife and two daughters is just a side point; it is set off with commas and is not essential to the grammar of the sentence. Since the real subject, the president, is singular, the verb should be singular too: is. nOTE It's easy to read sentences such as the first example and think that they are correct. That is because a plural word\u2014in this case, daughters\u2014is the word that comes right before the verb. The phrase two daughters are sounds natural, even though in this sen - tence it is not correct. Make sure to keep in mi nd what the real subject of a sentence is, so you know what verb form is necessary. Incorrect: The jury have left the courtroom to make their decision. Correct: The jury has left the courtroom to make its decision. A lthough jury r efers to a group of people, the actual word jury is a singular noun\u2014it means all of the jury members taken as a whole. Here are examples of other nouns that may see m plural at rst but are usually treated as singular and take a singular verb: team, family, group, band, committee, tribe, audience, and flock. I ncorrect: That bo xer don't have a chance against Carl. Correct: That boxer doesn't have a chance against Carl. A lthough the rst sentence may sound correct in casual speech, the word boxer is singular, so it should be followed by a singular verb form. Don't is a plural form. How to Get Subject-Verb Agreement Right Your main challenge when deciding if a sentence has co rrect subject-verb agreement will probably be determining who or what serves as the subject of the sentence. In most cases, this should be simple and will co me naturally to you. But as you saw in the previous examples, sometimes the real subject is not immedi-ately obvious. Here is another example. Can you identify the sub ject of the sentence? Only one of the students was ofcially registered for c lass. In this sentence, the subject is one, not students. Although it may seem as if the students are perform-ing the action, the true subject of the sentence is the one stud ent\u2014whoever that person may be\u2014meaning that the sentence requires the singular verb was. Here's another example: Vanessa and Erin are going to join the committee. It's easy to see that there are two subjects in this sen- tence: Vanessa and E rin. The verb is correctly plural: are. Now review these similar sentences: E ither Vanessa or Erin is going to join the committ ee. Neither Vanessa nor Erin is going to join the committee. I n both cases, even though there are still two names\u2014 Vanessa and E rin\u2014the subject is singular. In the rst case, only one of them is going to join the committee (we don't know who, but it will be only one of them). In the second case, neither one will; neither also requires a singular verb. 169169 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR nOTE Note that in these sentences, the subject comes after the verb. For example: If one plural and one singular subject are connected by or or nor, the verb form must agree with the closer subject. For instance: Neither Vanessa nor the teachers want to join the committee. Neither the teachers nor Vanessa wants to join the committee. Let's go back to our original example: Vanessa and Erin are going to join the committee. There are two nouns at the start of the sentence, and it is clear that there are two subjects: Vanessa and Erin. Now take a look at this example: Peanut butter and jelly is my favorite type of sandw ich. Although the phrase pean ut butter and jelly is made up of two nouns, we know that the term peanut but- ter and jelly re fers to one thing: a particular type of sandwich lling. In this case, you'd treat the whole phrase as one subject, so you would use a singular verb form (is). Here are other examples of subjects that may look pl ural at rst glance but are really singular: Spag hetti and meatballs was my grandmother's favorite dish. The New York Times is delivered to my door every morning. The United States has never won the Olympic gold in that sport. H ere is one last type of sentence that often causes sub ject-verb agreement problems: sentences that start with words such as There's, Here's , and What's. There's my dog, playing by the park bench. The subject of the sentence is my dog. I ncorrect: There's still three empty seats. Correct: There are still three empty seats. D on't forget that Ther e's is really a shorthand (or con- traction) of the phrase Ther e is. Since the subject of this sentence\u2014seats\u2014is plural, the sentence requires a plural introduction: There are. I ncorrect: What 's the side effects of this medication? Correct: What are the side effects of this medication? S imilarly, What' s is a contraction of What is, which is incorrect here because the subject of this sentence is plural: side effects. Practice For each sentence, ll in the blank with either is or ar e. 5. Red Rocks ________ their favorite concert ve nue in Colorado. 6. Julio, as well as the rest of the band, ________ ex cited about performing at Red Rocks. 7. Two members of the band ________ still back at the hote l. 8. Everyone ________ supposed to be onstage rig ht now! 9. Where ________ Julio and the guitar player? 170170 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR For the following three questions, select the best revi-sion of the underlined part of the sentence. 10. Catherine is gone to the store later today. a. go b. will go c. went d. has gone 11. Gerald and Yolanda have visited me yesterday. a. visited b. are visiting c. visits d. had visited 12. Neither you nor your cousins appearing in the phot ograph. a. appears b. is appearing c. appear d. to appear Pronouns In order to understand the correct use of pronouns, you must rst have a clear understanding of what a noun is. Nouns are words that identify objects. People: students, brother, David, neighbor Places: New York City, ocean, university, Jupiter Things: books, Saturday, bathing suit, the U.S. Navy Id eas and qualities: beauty, faith, anger, justice A pronoun is a word that replaces or refers to a noun. Consider the following examples: Sheldon prefers cereal to toast and jam. This can be rewritten with a pronoun as: H e prefers cereal to toast and jam. Last Friday, Josh drove to Kathy and Tina's cabin. T his can be rewritten with pronouns as: L ast Friday, he dr ove to their cabin. Jackson doesn't care about anyone except Jackson. T his can be rewritten with pronouns as: He doesn't care about anyone except himself. T here are many pronouns in the English language, de pending on what type of noun the pronoun is replacing and how the pronoun functions in a sen- tence. Here are some examples of pronouns: I, y ou, she, he, we, they, it, this, that, myself, ourselves, who-ever, whomever, mine, yours. Pronouns and Antecedents When a pronoun is used in a sentence, it should be clear what noun(s) it is substituting for or referring to. That noun is called an antecedent. For example: Adam had fun while he w as on vacation in Puerto Rico. The pronoun he is anothe r way of saying the word Adam. Adam is the antecedent of he. Here is another: My grandparents rst met when they were in college. The plural pronoun they stands in for the plural noun grandparents, which is the antecedent. This may seem simple enough, but confusion ov er pronouns and antecedents can arise in more complicated sentences. You may be asked to spot or correct this type of problem on the GED\u00ae RLA test. Consider this incorrect sentence: 171171 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR Despite what the president told the reporters, they are not going to authorize military action. The sentence may sound correct to the ear, but if we gi ve it some thought, do we really know what is meant by the pronoun they? (To put it another way: Do we know what the antecedent is of they?) They is a plural pronoun, so it can't refer to the p resident, which is a singular noun. It could refer to the reporters, which is a plural noun, but that doesn't make sense logically\u2014reporters are not in charge of the military. Does they mean some other group of people (members of a committee or army generals)? Or should it be changed to he, to mean the president? As you can see, when there is no obvious ante- cedent to a pronoun, the meaning of an entire sen-tence can be unclear. Beware of They Another common pronoun problem arises when the wr iter is discussing a person (singular) but isn't sure what gender to use\u2014she/her/her or he/him/his\u2014so tries to keep things vague by using a plural pronoun (they/them/their) instead. Consider this example: If a student is late to class three times, they will be reported to the principal. The pronoun they d oesn't work here because it's plu- ral but its antecedent is the singular noun stude nt. Here is a correct way to rewrite the sentence: If a student is late to class three times, he o r she will be reported to the principal. Or you could rephrase the sentence this way: If students ar e late to class three times, they will be reported to the principal. Subject Pronouns and Object Pronouns When editing sentences for correct pronoun use, you will need to determine whether the pronoun is the subject or the object of the sentence. Consider the following sentence: Jane brought Jack to the dentist. Jane is the subject of the sentence\u2014the person who is a cting out the verb brought. Jack is the object\u2014the person who is receiving the action of the verb. If we wanted to swap out the words Jane and J ack with pronouns, we would need to use a subjec- tive pronoun for Jane and an objective pronoun for Jack. Note the correct sentence, after a couple of incorrect tries: Incorrect: She br ought he to the dentist. Incorrect: He r brought him to the dentist. Correct: She br ought him to the dentist. Here is a list of subject and object pronouns. Make sur e you know the difference: Subject Object I you he she it we who they me you him her it us whom them Who versus Whom This brings us to one of the most common grammar problems in the English language: using the word who (a subjective pronoun) when the word whom (an objective pronoun) is called for. This error could 172172 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR appear on the GED\u00ae RLA test, so make sure you know how to spot it. Consider the following examples: Who made dinner last night? Who is the subject of this sentence. Whoever that m ysterious meal-preparing person is, he or she per - formed the action of the sentence (making dinner). Whom should John invite to your party? Here, John is the subject of the sentence. John is going to perform the action of the sentence (inviting one or more guests). Whom is the object of the sentence: it refers to one or more persons who will receive the action of the sentence (John's invitation). An easy way to test whether you should use who o r whom in a sentence is to swap it for another pro- noun that you're more familiar with and check to see if that mak es sense. Let's try out this trick on the following sentence: [Who/Whom] is Jake going to marry? First, let's try to answer the question with the word she. It is a subjective pronoun, so it will test whether the subjective pronoun who would work in the sentence. [Who/Whom] is Jake going to marry? Jake is going to marry she. That is clearly not grammatical. Now let's try an ob jective pronoun, her: [Who/Whom] is Jake going to marry? Jake is going to marry her. That makes sense, so we know that we need another ob jective pronoun\u2014whom\u2014for the question: Whom is Jake going to marry? Here is another example: I ncorrect: Ms. D ee is the teacher who I always ask for advice. Correct: Ms. Dee is the teacher whom I always ask for advice. W hen deciding whether to use who o r whom, look at the core phrase: I ask ________. I ask her would be grammatical, not I ask she. Therefore, in our sentence, we need to use the same type of pronoun as her (objective). That means we need to use whom. I ncorrect: Gor don is the man whom lives down the street. Correct: Gordon is the man who lives down the street. T o determine who v ersus whom, the core phrase is: ________ lives down the street. Let's test it: H im lives down the street. He lives down the street. The second sentence, with the subjective pronoun he, is correct, so we should use who in our sentence. N ow take a look at these more advanced exam - ples to prepare for the GED\u00ae RLA test. The same rules for who and whom apply to who - ever and w homever. I ncorrect: I'll play chess with whoever. Correct: I'll play chess with whomever. 173173 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR The core phrase here is: I'll play with ________. The missing word is an object of the preposition with, so we need to use the objective pronoun whomever. Let's do that test again, just to be sure. Let's try the sent ence with a subjective pronoun, she: I'll play chess with she. That is clearly not correct. The subjective pronoun who ever is therefore not correct. Now let's try the objective pronoun her: I'll play chess with her. That's a perfect t, so the objective pronoun whom - ever must be right. Practice F or each of the following questions, ll in the blank with who, whom, whoever , or whomever. 13. _______ are you taking to the dance? 14. _______ is making that noise had better quiet do wn! 15. That man over there is the customer _______ co mplained about me to my boss. 16. _______ is taking you to the dance? Possessive Pronouns Like possessive nouns players'), possessive pronouns show ownership. However, possessive pronouns do not use apostrophes. I ncorrect: The p urple and green balloons were their's. Correct: The purple and green balloons were theirs. I ncorrect: It's tail w as long and furry. Correct: Its tail was long and furry. N ote that some possessive pronouns function as adje ctives and are used to describe a noun. For instance: my car (my describes the noun car), her ten - nis shoes (her descr ibes the noun tennis shoes), and your strawberries (your describes the noun strawberries). Other possessive pronouns function as nouns themse lves, for instance: The b lue car is mine. Those tennis shoes are hers. Yours are sweeter than ours. Make sure you are familiar with the spelling of both types of possessive pronouns: P ossessive (adjective) Possessive (noun) my mine your yours his his her hers its its our ours whose whose their theirs Read the following sentence. Then replace the under - lined words with the correct pronouns: When Lisa and Jim's friend Tony arrived home from Iraq, Lisa and Jim took Tony to Tony's favorite restaurant and told Tony to order whatever Tony liked. W hen Lisa and Jim's friend Tony arrived home fro m Iraq, they took him to his favorite restaurant and told him to order whatever he liked. 174174 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR Lisa and Jim translates to they because Lisa and Jim serves as a subject of the sentence (Lisa and Jim are the people who are performing the main action\u2014 taking Tony to dinner). Tony's is a possessive noun, which translates to the p ossessive pronoun his. To gure out the rest of the answers\u2014pronouns that r eplace the word Tony \u2014ask yourself whether Tony is a subject (performing an action) or an object (receiving an action). If he's the subject, make it he. If he's the object, make it him. Pronouns Combined with Other Nouns Often pronouns are combined with other subjects or objects in a sentence. For instance, in the following sentence, there is one subject (Ruth) and two objects (Peter and _______): Ruth drove Peter and _______ to the football game. Do you know which pronoun should ll in the blank? Ruth drove Peter and me to the football game. Ruth drove Peter and I to the football game. Although the second sentence may sound correct, it is not. (It may sound correct to you because we hear this type of phrasing all the time. Many people use it because they think it sounds more proper or formal, but in reality it is poor grammar.) The rst sentence is right. The word me is an o bjective pronoun, which is what is needed in the grammar of this sentence. I is a subjective pronoun, which is incorrect here. There's an easy trick for nding the correct pro- noun in situations such as this (when a pronoun is co mbined with another noun and you want to know what type of pronoun to use): Cr oss out the other phrase\u2014here, Peter and\u2014and then see what pro- noun you need. Here it would be: Ruth drove me to the football game. You would never say: Ruth drove I to the football game. Practice For each of the following questions, choose the pro-noun that ts best. 17. Joe had _______ temperature taken at the doc-tor's ofce on Tuesday. a. its b. his c. him d. none of the above 18. Someone forgot to lock up _______ shoes and gy m bag. a. his or her b. his or hers c. their d. there 19. The closet is so dark! I can't tell which coat is _______ and whic h is _______. a. your, my b. yours, mine c. our, their d. our, they're 175175 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR dangling and misplaced m odifiers A dangling modier is a misplaced word or phrase. If a word or a phrase is placed incorrectly in a sentence, the meaning of the sentence can be misinterpreted. How to Spot Dangling Modifiers Incorrect: Running for the bus, my backpack fell in the street. This suggests that the subject of the sentence\u2014my bac kpack\u2014was running for the bus, which we know is not correct! The phrase Running for the bus is a dangling modier because it describes the action of the person speaking, but that person is not mentioned in the sentence. Here is the sentence written correctly: Correct: As I was running for the bus, my back- p ack fell in the street. When editing sentences for dangling modiers, pay atte ntion to words that end in -ing and appear at the beginning of the sentence. This can signal a sentence that has a dangling modier. For example: Incorrect: Searc hing the entire house, the key was under the table. This sentence says that the key searched the entire house, w hich doesn't make sense. Correct: After searching the entire house, he f ound the key under the table. Most dangling modifiers occur at the begin- nings of sentences, but they can appear at the ends of sentences, too. nOTE How to Spot Misplaced Modifiers Now let's look at a similar type of error: misplaced modiers. These are phrases or clauses that appear in the wrong spot in a sentence, so it seems as if they describe one thing when they really are intended to describe something else. For example: Incorrect: Ten minutes later, a sad-looking man in a dirty suit with yellow teeth entered the room. Correct: Ten minutes later, a sad-looking man w ho wore a dirty suit and had yellow teeth entered the room. The suit didn't have yellow teeth\u2014the man did. I ncorrect: She gave homemade treats to the kids w rapped in tinfoil. Correct: She gave the kids homemade treats wrapped in tinfoil. T he kids weren't wrapped in tinfoil\u2014the treats were. Only, Just, Barely, and Nearly The words only, barely, just, and almost should appear right before the noun or verb being modied. Their placement determines the message of the sentence. Only Peter ran to the store. (No one else but Peter went.) Peter only ran to the store. (He didn't walk.) P eter ran only to the store. (He didn't go any - where else.) 176176 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR Peter ran to the only store. (There was no other store around but that one.) Peter ran to the store only. (He ran to the store and did nothing else.) Practice F or each of the following sentences, select the best re vision. 20. Moving to Nevada, Shira's truck broke down. a. While Shira was moving to Nevada, her tr uck broke down. b. Shira's truck, moving to Nevada, broke do wn. c. Shira's truck broke down while moving to Ne vada. d. The sentence is correct as is. 21. Exhausted after a long day at the ofce, Tom onl y used the treadmill for ten minutes before heading home from the gym. a. After Tom's exhausting day at the ofce, he onl y used the treadmill for ten minutes before heading home from the gym. b. Exhausted after a long day at the ofce, Tom head ed home from the gym after only using the treadmill for ten minutes. c. Exhausted after a long day at the ofce, Tom used the t readmill for only ten minutes before heading home from the gym. d. The sentence is correct as is. 22. Historians have wondered whether General Tho mas Herald was really a woman in disguise for more than 200 years. a. For more than 200 years, historians have wo ndered whether General Thomas Herald was really a woman in disguise. b. Historians have wondered, Was General Tho mas Herald really a woman in disguise for more than 200 years? c. Historians have wondered whether General Tho mas Herald, in disguise, was really a woman for more than 200 years. d. The sentence is correct as is. Sentence Construction Sentence construction refers to the way sentences are created: how we join together subjects, verbs, objects, and other elements to express a complete thought. Complete Sentences You can't just string words together to create a sen-tence. To form a complete sentence, you need to have thre e basic elements: 1. A subject: This is who or what the sentence is abou t. 2. A predicate: This states what the subject is or do es. 3. The sentence must express a co mplete thought. Look at this example: The phone is ringing. 177177 n - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR This is a short but complete sentence. Why? It satis- es the three requirements: 1. It has a subject: the phone. 2. I t has a predicate: is ring ing. It explains what the subject is doing. 3. It expresses a complete thought. We know what happ ened and what was involved. Now look at these examples: S it down. Don't run. Give me a break. A re they complete sentences? Yes. These are very shor t, complete sentences that command, or tell, someone to do something. You can see that each has a predicate, but where is the subject? When it comes to commands, grammar experts think of the subject as being built into the command\u2014the subject is the person being spoken to. What's important to remem-ber is that commands can stand on their own as real sent ences. If a string of words doesn't have a subject or a pr edicate, it is a sentence fragment. Sentence frag- ments cannot stand on their own. Practice Identify the subject and the predicate of the following sent ences. 23. The woman in the lobby is waiting for Mr. Wil liams. Subject: ______________________ Predicate: ____________________ 24. Mr. Williams went downstairs. Sub ject: ______________________ Predicate: ____________________ Independent and Dependent Clauses One of the building blocks of writing is the clause: a string of words that includes a subject and a predi-cate. Some clauses express a complete thought and can stand on their own as sentences. These are called independent clauses. Other clauses, however, express an incomplete thought and cannot stand on their own. These are called dependent clauses. They need to be attached to an independent clause in order to fully make sense. Here are some examples of both types: Independent clause: It star ted snowing. Dependent clause: Aft er Emily won the contest. Notice that the rst clause expresses a complete idea (it b egan to snow) and that it is a grammatically cor - rect sentence on its own. But the dependent clause is incomplete\u2014it's be gging for a resolution. (After Emily won the con- test, what happened?). As is, this clause is not a sen- t ence; it's a sentence fragment. To create a gr ammatically correct sentence in this case, you can do two things: Simply remove the word after: E mily won the contest. n Attach the dependent clause to an independent clause using a comma: After Emily won the contest, dependent clause she jumped up and down in excitement. independent clause H ere's another example: Dependent clause: That y ou should avoid eating in order to lose weight. 178178 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR n n As is, it's not a real sentence. To create a real sentence in this case, you can: Remove the word that: Y ou should avoid eating in order to lose weight. Attach the dependent clause to an independent c lause; for instance: that you should avoid eating in order to lose weight. dependent clause Potato chips and cookies are two foods independent clause Coordinating Conjunctions You probably use coordinating conjunctions all the time without realizing that they have a name; they are words that are used to connect independent clauses together to create one longer sentence. There are seven coordinating conjunctions: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, and so. You can use the acronym FANBOYS to remember them. Here's an example of how they're used: I ndependent clause: It 's going to rain this afternoon. Independent clause: I still want to go to the game. W e can use the coordinating conjunction but (pl us a comma) to join them together: It's going to rain this afternoon, but I st ill want to go to the game. Subordinating Conjunctions Another way to connect clauses is to use a subordi - nating conjunction\u2014words such as afte r, because, and unless. As an example, let's join together these two inde pendent clauses: In dependent clause: No o ne takes out the garbage. Independent clause: It smells horrible in the garage. D epending on which conjunction we choose, we'll co mmunicate additional information about the situ- ation in the garage. For example: It smells horrible in the garage be cause no one takes out the garbage. By using because, we're making the point that the o dor is caused by the fact that no one takes out the garbage. If we choose a different conjunction, we'll describe a different scenario and make a different point. For instance: Even though it sme lls horrible in the garage, no one takes out the garbage. Here's another example of two independent clauses and way s to connect them: Independent clause: Jonathan quit. Independent clause: I had to work overtime. I had to work overtime after Jonathan quit. Because Jonathan quit, I had to work overtime. You may have noticed that when you add a subordi-nating conjunction to an independent clause, you creat e a dependent clause. For example, in the exam- ple just given, Jonathan quit is an independent clause. Even though it's just two words, it can function as a real sentence all by itself. But if you add a subordinat-ing conjunction, it no longer can stand on its own as a r eal sentence. For example, Because Jonathan quit is not a complete thought. It prompts the reader to ask, Because what? 179179 n - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR Here's a list of common subordinating conjunctions: SubO rdina Ting COnjunCTiOn uSE ExamPLE because since so that in order that to show cause and effect or purpose U 7 e >\u00c0e >tten`\u0088n} V\u008f>ss because we want to before after while when whenever until once as soon as as long as to show time or time sequence U Before even thoughwhereas to show contrast U *ete\u00c0 \u00ab>sse` t e test t hough as if as much as to shows\u0088\u0093\u0088\u008f>\u00c0\u0088t\u00de U - e \u008f\u009c\u009c\u008ee` as though s e >` seen > } \u009cst\u00b0 / e V \u0088\u008f`\u00c0 en \u00dc>nt t\u009c \u008en\u009c\u00dc where their parents used to live.

I moved to Paris, so I learned how to speak Fr ench. b. After I moved to Paris, I learned how to speak F rench. c. I learned how to speak French after I moved to P aris. d. I moved to Paris, wherever I learned how to speak F rench. Run-On Sentences A run-on sentence occurs when one independent clause runs right into another independent clause without proper punctuation. Sometimes no punctua-tion is used at all, while other times there is just a co mma between the two thoughts. Here are some examples of run-on sentences: T erri wants to leave now, she's tired. Whether or not you believe me it's true I did not lie to you. T here are several ways to correct this type of error. You can: Add a period, a question mark, or an exclamation p oint to create separate sentences. 180180 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR n n n Add a conjunction (and a comma, if needed) to join the clauses together. Add a semicolon, colon, or dash to join the clauses together. Rewrite one or more of the clauses. H ere are a few ways to correct the earlier examples: T erri wants to leave now\u2014she's tired. Terri wants to leave now because she's tired. Whether or not you believe me, it's true. I did not lie to you! Whethe r or not you believe me, it's true; I did not lie to you. Whether or not you believe me, it's true\u2014I did not lie to you. Practice S elect the revision that is NOT a good way to correct the run-o n sentence. 26. Greenville is in the middle of nowhere, it's a real ly boring place to grow up. a. Greenville is in the middle of nowhere. It's a real ly boring place to grow up. b. Greenville is a really boring place to grow up; in the midd le of nowhere. c. Greenville is a really boring place to grow up be cause it's in the middle of nowhere. d. Greenville is a really boring place to grow up\u2014it' s in the middle of nowhere. Complex Sentences As you learned before, many sentences contain both a dependent clause and an independent clause (they're joined together by the subordinating conjunction that's built into the dependent clause). This type of sentence is called a complex sentence. A complex sentence can begin with either the independent clause or the dependent clause. Comma placement depends on how the sentence is constructed. While you were sleeping / , / the thunderstorm came thr o ugh the city. Dependent clause / comma / independent clause The thunderstorm came through the city / while yo u were sleeping. Independent clause / no comma / dependent clause B ecause the city received so much snow / , / school wil l be canceled today. Dependent clause / comma / independent clause Sc hool will be canceled today / because the city rec eived so much snow. Independent clause / no comma / dependent clause D id you notice a pattern with the commas? When the de pendent clause is tacked onto the beginning of the independent clause, a comma is needed between the two clauses. When the dependent clause is tacked onto the end of the independent clause, no comma is needed. You can use this rule when correcting sentences on the GED\u00ae test. Be careful to understand what is being said in the sentence you are correcting, how-ever; sometimes the meaning of the sentence or other gr ammar rules will affect whether you should use a comma. Which of the following sentences is NOT cor - rectly punctuated? a. Even though I ate a huge dinner, I still want to t ry your macaroni and cheese. b. I know it will be really delicious because the che f used so much cheese and cream. c. Please don't nish it, before I get to try a spo onful. d. If you don't want me to have any, just tell me. 181181 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR Choice c is the correct answer. Here, the sentence starts off with an independent clause. There should not be a comma. Parallel Construction Before we explain this idea, look at the following example: When Jim was dieting, he would usually eat just brown rice, grilled chicken, salad, and treat him-self to nonfat ice cream for dessert. D id you notice a problem with this sentence? The pr oblem is that the elements are not all parallel. Par- allelism is a grammar rule that says that similar ele- me nts in a sentence should be written in a similar way . Here, the similar elements are the four things that J im WOULD eat when he was dieting. Let's look at them: 1. brown rice 2. grilled chicken 3. salad 4. treat himself to nonfat ice cream for dessert You may have noticed that the rst three items are paral lel\u2014they're all nouns\u2014but the fourth item is different\u2014it's a long phrase that starts off with a verb (treat). There's another problem, too. Look at the words that intr oduce those four items: When Jim was dieting, he would usually eat just . . . Ea ch of the items needs to make sense after that intr oduction. To test this, just plug in each of the items after the introduction. For example, the rst item makes sense: When Jim was dieting, he would usually eat just bro wn rice. The second item is grammatical, too: When Jim was dieting, he would usually eat just gr illed chicken. The third item is also grammatical: When Jim was dieting, he would usually eat just salad. But the fourth item doesn't make sense after the intr oduction: When Jim was dieting, he would usually eat just tr eat himself to nonfat ice cream for dessert. There are many ways to x the original sentence, but her e is the most obvious way: When Jim was dieting, he would usually eat just bro wn rice, grilled chicken, salad, and nonfat ice cream for dessert. We deleted tr eat himself to. Now all four items are parallel\u2014they're all nouns. 182182 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR Practice 27.

Capitalization After you read certain passages on the GED\u00ae test, you'll be asked to x grammar errors contained in some of the sentences. One of the things you may need to correct is capitalization, so it's important that you learn the rules of when to use capital letters and when to use lowercase letters. You probably already know that the rst letter of the rst word of every sentence must be capitalized 183183 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR and that the pronoun I should always be a capital let- ter, but there are many other times when you should use upp ercase letters, too. Titles and Names Titles such as Ms., Mrs., Miss, Mr., and Dr. are always capitalized. Many other words in the English language\u2014 nouns s uch as mayor, judge, princess, and chairper- son\u2014can serve as a title when placed in front of a person's name. When they are used this way, these words should be capitalized. For example: Sec retary of State John Kerry President Barack Obama Aunt Jane Uncle Tim Queen Elizabeth Prince Harry Pope Francis Judge Judy Ambassador Jackson General Jack Kurutz Private Benjamin T hese words do double duty in the English language. As you can see in the list, they can serve as titles when placed in front of a person's name. But they also often serve as plain old nouns. On the GED\u00ae test, don't automatically capitalize words like president, general, or king when you see them. In many cases, they are simply being used as common nouns and should be lowercase. Look at these examples: U sed as a title: Pr esident Barack Obama Used as a noun: The president of the United States is Barack Obama. Use d as a title: General Jack Kurutz Used as a noun: Jack Kurutz was a heroic gen- eral in World War II. Used as a noun and as a title: My favorite aunt is Aunt Jane. Proper Nouns A proper noun is a specic person, place, or thing. The names of these people, places, and things should always be capitalized. Here are some examples of proper nouns and how the y should be capitalized: P eople Eleano r Roosevelt Lady Gaga John F. Kennedy George Bush Sr. Uncle Tim Mayor Ed Koch Queen Elizabeth Plac es United States of America China Los Angeles North Fourth Street Central Park Union Station Eiffel Tower Woodside Hospital Thing s/Events/Etc. Philadelphia Eagles United Airlines Crest Oscar Mayer ESPN NASA Saturn Battle of Bunker Hill St. Patrick's Day Fourth of July Car and Driver (the magazine) Modern Family (the TV show) In the Name of the Father (the movie) \"Livin' on a Prayer\" (the song) Y ou may have noticed that some of the words in these names\u2014such as the and of\u2014are no t capitalized, although we stated earlier that proper nouns should always be capitalized. Why is this? 184184 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR n n The rules of capitalization are very detailed\u2014and sometimes the experts differ on what they should be\u2014but in general, in proper names the following words should be lowercase unless they are the rst word of the name. the, a , an (articles) to, from, on, in, of, with, and other prepositions (some experts capitalize prepositions that have four or more letters) n and, but, or, yet (conjunctions) R emember that when these words start off the proper noun, the y are capitalized, not lowercase. For exam- ple: In Touch (the magazine), A Beautiful Mind (the movie), For Whom the Bell Tolls (the book). Geographical Words As with other proper names, the names of countries, states, cities, regions, and the like\u2014and the words that are based on them\u2014should be capitalized. For example: A sia, Asian Portugal, Portuguese France, French, Frenchwoman, Frenchman Great Britain, British Middle East, Middle Eastern the South, Southern (referring to those states in the United States) A ntarctica Rome, Roman N ew York City, New Yorker Morris County Movies, Books, Songs, and So On The names of books, movies, plays, TV shows, songs, albums, and the like are another type of proper noun and should be capitalized. The same goes for newspa-per headlines, the titles of magazine articles, the titles of essays you write, and more. For example: R omeo and Juliet (play) Back to the Future (movie) The Big Bang Theory (TV show) The Wind in the Willows (book) \"Mayor Vows: City Will Bounce Back from Hur- ricane Sandy\" (newspaper headline) \"W hy Violence Is Never the Answer\" (magazine article) Events and Time Periods As with other proper nouns, specic historical peri-ods and events should be capitalized. Centuries should not be capitalized when used as a regular noun in a sentence, though. Look at these examples: the Revolutionary War the Great Depression the Middle Ages The twentieth century marked a turning point in technology. Directions Directions on the compass (west, south, northeast, etc.) are considered to be common nouns and are not capitalized. Directions also sometimes serve as proper names of specic places, however. When used in this way, they should be capitalized, as all proper nouns should be. For example: The Grand Canyon is one of the biggest tourist attr actions in the Southwest. Here, Southwest means a specic region of the United States\u2014the southwest corner of the country that includes Arizona and New Mexico. The school is ve miles southwest of Santa Fe. Here, southwest means the compass direction, so it should be lowercase. 185185 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR Calendar Items The days of the week, the months of the year, and holidays all need to be capitalized. (Do not capitalize the seasons unless they are used in a proper name, in a title, or in another way that would require a noun to have an uppercase letter.) Examples: Monday January Easter Fourth of July summer, fall, winter, spring Note this example: The club's Tenth Annual Winter Showcase will be held in J anuary. In this case, Wint er is capitalized because it is part of a proper name\u2014the name of a specic event\u2014not because it's a season. The name of the event could just as easily be Tenth Annual Talent Showcase. Proper Nouns versus Common Nouns Here is one more important thing to think about with proper nouns: You'll often nd them blended with common nouns\u2014for example, Crest toothpaste or Oscar Mayer hot dogs. Notice that to othpaste and hot dogs are lower - case. Why? The word Crest is a proper noun\u2014it's a brand name\u2014but toothpaste is a regular old noun. It should stay lowercase. Similarly, Oscar Mayer is a brand name, but hot dogs is a common noun, so it should be lowercase. What if you encounter an example like Unit ed Airlines? Should Airlines be capitalized? Well, this depends on whether or not it is part of the ofcial name of the company. In this case, it is\u2014United Air - lines is the full, proper name of the business, so A ir- lines should be capitalized. Just remember: if you know (or can gure out fro m the passage you're reading) that a word is part of a proper name, it should be capitalized. If it is just a common noun, it should be lowercase. Now look at these examples of proper nouns ble nded with common nouns. Note which words are capitalized (the proper noun) and which are lower - case (the common noun): The Supreme Court justice gave a speech at the school. I hav e a coupon for a free McDonald's hamburger . The NASA space shuttle will blast off on Sunday. Capitalization in Quotations When a direct quote is included in a sentence and it's paired with a phrase like she said, they shouted, he replied, or I wrote to explain who is doing the talking (or the shouting, replying, or writing), the rst word of the quotation should be capitalized. Here are some examples: I ncorrect: After dessert, he said quietly, \"this was the w orst meal of my life.\" Correct: After dessert, he said quietly, \"This was the worst meal of my life.\" I ncorrect: The c hef told his assistant, \"when you learn how to bake wedding cakes, you will get a raise.\" Correct: The chef told his assistant, \"When you learn how to bake wedding cakes, you will get a raise.\" I ncorrect: When I asked what her costume was, Erica replied, \"a scary clown.\" Correct: When I asked what her costume was, Erica replied, \"A scary clown.\" 186186 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR n n While A scary clown is not a complete sentence, it is a complete quote, and it is introduced by the phrase Erica replied. Therefore, the rst word of the quote should be capitalized. nOTE When a quote is split in two in a sentence, do not capitalize the first word of the sec - ond part, unless there is another reason to do so. To explain this point, let's go back to one of the previ- ous examples: The chef told his assistant, \"When you learn how to b ake wedding cakes, you will get a raise.\" The sentence can be reworked by splitting the quote in two: \" When you learn how to bake wedding cakes,\" the che f told his assistant, \"you will get a raise.\" Note that you should still be lowercase. This is because it is a word that is a continuation of a quoted sen-tence (\"When you learn how to bake wedding cakes, yo u will get a raise\"); it is not the rst word of the quoted sentence. Here are two more correct examples that make the same po int: \" When you go on the boat,\" Carlos told us, \"do not f eed the sharks.\" Carlos told us, \"Do not feed the sharks.\" N ow look at this nal example, to avoid confusion on the GED\u00ae t est: \"M ia is on her way,\" Mike said. \"She just arrived at the bus stat ion.\" Why should She b e capitalized? Because this is not a case of a quoted sentence being split up. Instead, there are two complete, separate sentences: Note that the rst sentence ends in a period. \"Mia is on her way,\" Mike said. and \"She just arrived at the bus station.\" She should be capitalized because it's the rst word of a sentence, even though that sentence happens to be a quote. using apostrophes to Cr eate Possessive nouns and Contractions In English, apostrophes are an important tool that can help you create possessive words ( the dog's house, Aunt Jane's car ) as well as contractions (they're, it's). This lesson explains how and when to use apostrophes. Possessive Nouns A possessive noun shows the ownership that the noun has over something else. To make a noun pos-sessive, add the following to the end of the word: For most singular nouns: Add an apostrophe and the letter s. For most plural nouns: Add just an apostrophe. 187187 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR Look at these examples: A Mistake to Avoid A nthony's ofce the child's blanket the two brothers' toys the ladies' room the dog's bones [one dog has bones] the dogs' bones [two or more dogs have bones] nOTE Some plural nouns do not end in s, such as children, women, mice, and deer. In these cases, add an apostrophe and an s: the children's books the mice's cheese When you are editing a sentence that contains a pos- sessive noun, you will need to decide if it is singular or plural. The best way to do this is to read the entire sentence for clues. Here are some examples of a basic grammar mistake that man y people make and that may be tested on the GED\u00ae test: I ncorrect: The b oy's are building a treehouse. Incorrect: I just adopted two puppy's. W hat's the problem with these sentences? In each, the wr iter tried to make a plural word by using an apos- trophe and the letter s. Look at the correct versions: C orrect: The bo ys are building a treehouse. Correct: I just adopted two puppies. T here is no need for an apostrophe when a noun is plur al. Use apostrophes when you make nouns pos- sessive (for instance, the boy s' treehouse, the puppies' adoption), not when you simply make nouns plural (the boys have a treehouse, the puppies were adopted). Contractions A contraction refers to the process of joining together two words to create one shorter word. An apostrophe replaces the letter(s) removed in the process. The following is a list of common contractions: 188188 - - LANGUAGE AND e >\u00dbe For practice, replace the underlined words with the correct contractions. Do not forget that we are right around the cor- ner if you cannot nd the keys. A nswer: Don't fo rget that we're right around the corner if you can't nd the keys. The contraction of do not is don 't, the contraction of we are is we're (NOT were!), and the contraction of cannot is can't. Contractions versus Possessive Pronouns In English, there are a few contractions that are pro- nounced the same as a few possessive pronouns, and many p eople mistake these words. You may see ques- tions on the GED\u00ae test that assess whether you know the differ ence. Here's an example: C orrect: The dog hurt its pa w. Incorrect: The dog hurt it's paw. T he second sentence is incorrect because it's is a con- traction of it is. That means that the sentence really says The dog hurts it is paw, which does not make any sense. Here are some words that people commonly confuse: Contraction Possessive Pronoun it's (it is) its you're (you are) your they're (they are) their who's (who is) whose 189189 Do not use a comma when only two items are joined by and or or. That is not a series, so it doesn't need a comma. - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR Contractions always use apostrophes. Pos- sessive pronouns never use apostrophes. rEmE mbEr An easy way to remember this is to think about what a contraction really is: in casual speech, we sometimes slide two words together, making one word. (You are becomes you're ; would not becomes wouldn't; and so on.) In the process of sliding the words together, we drop out one or two of the letters. The apostrophe replaces the letter(s) that dropped out. (When we contract you are to make you're , we drop the a. The apostrophe replaces that a.) Practice 33. Select the grammatically correct sentence. a. We're going to stay at my familys house. b. We're going to stay at my family's house. c. We're going to stay at my families house. d. Were going to stay at my family's house. 34. Select the grammatically correct sentence. a. Toms sister wasn't planning to come to his childr ens' graduation. b. Tom's sister wasnt planning to come to his childr ens' graduation. c. Tom's sister wasn't planning to come to his childr en's graduation. d. none of the above 35. Select the grammatically correct sentence. a. You're not going to x that cars problems withou t the proper tools. b. Your not going to x that cars problem's withou t the proper tools. c. You're not going to x that cars' problems withou t the proper tools. d. none of the above Sentence Punctuation Proper punctuation marks are necessary when writ-ing complete and correct sentences. End Marks A complete sentence must end with correct punctua-tion. The punctuation at the end of the sentence de pends on what type of sentence it is. 1. A statement ends with a period. Minnesota is known for its cold winters. 2. A question ends with a question mark. Do you think it will snow tonight? 3. An exclamation\u2014that is, a sentence with strong emot ion\u2014ends with an exclamation point. Call the police! Commas Commas are used to indicate breaks in different parts of a sentence. People are often confused about when to use a comma\u2014it is common to place too many commas in a sentence. The following list outlines comma rules for standard English: 1. Use commas to separate three or more items in a series that includes the word and or or. I lost my w allet, my gloves, and my car keys all on one day. Add ketchup, mayonnaise, or mustard to the sandwich. Bring the paperwork, three forms of ID, and a photo to the ofce. Note that the comma is placed before and o r or, not after it. Incorrect: Bring the paperwork, and three forms of ID to the ofce. 190190 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR Correct: Bring the paperwork and three forms of ID to the ofce. 2. Use a comma after an introductory phrase. An intr oductory phrase can be a prepositional phrase that begins a sentence. In the end, Jamie was glad she had worked all w eekend painting her room. After hearing the weather report, the boss moved the company picnic indoors. 3. Use a comma before a coordinating conjunc-tion that joins two independent clauses. An inde pendent clause contains a subject and a verb and would function as a grammatically correct sentence if it stood alone. Examples of coordinating conjunctions that join indepen-dent clauses are and, but , nor, or, so, and yet . I wanted to go to the movies, but I didn' t have enough money to pay for the ticket. William completed the computer training, so he decided to apply for a new job. 4. Use commas to separate an appositive from the rest o f the sentence if it is a nonrestrictive appositive that gives information about some-thing mentioned in the sentence but it is not essent ial to the core meaning or grammar of the sentence. Do not use commas with restric-tive appositives (e.g., the po et Robert Burns). Renita, the tall girl down the hall, will pick up my mail w hile I am on vacation. The ofce will be closed on Friday, the last day of the month. 5. Use a comma when a dependent clause comes be fore the independent clause. After I complete my degree, I plan to move to L os Angeles. If you are sick, you must contact your supervisor. 6. Use a comma to separate the year in a date. March 14, 2008, is my daughter's birthday. 7. Use commas to separate a state name from a city name (o r a country name from a city name, etc.). Kansas City, Kansas, is my birthplace. I' d love to visit my friends in Alberta, Canada, next year. The flight began in Beijing, China, stopped in Osaka, Japan, and arrived 12 hours later in San Francisco, California. Practice 36. Select the best revision of the sentence below: Larr y my friend since high school lives next door. a. Larry, my friend from high school lives next doo r. b. Larry, my friend from high school lives, next doo r. c. Larry, my friend from high school, lives next doo r. d. Correct as is. Semicolons and Colons A semicolon (;) can be used to join two independent clauses. Joining two independent clauses this way suggests that the two clauses are related in meaning and of equal importance. Every Friday we go out for dinner and see a movie; it is our r eward for a long week at work. There are several instances when a colo n (:) can be used in a sentence. 1. Use a colon after an independent clause to intr oduce a list. Travis requested his favorite meal for his bir thday: pizza, cheese bread, and ice cream. 191191 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR 2. Use a colon after an independent clause to intr oduce a quotation. Emily explained her reason for leaving the magazine: \"It's a dead-end job, no matter how hard I work.\" 3. Use a colon between two independent clauses whe n you want to emphasize the second clause. The result of the poll was clear: Obama wo uld probably win the election. Quotation Marks Quotation marks are used around direct quotes\u2014 that is, the words a person or character says. For example: U ncle John said, \"It has been years since I have see n my sister's children.\" \"I refuse to pay for this meal,\" Laura shouted, \"because there is a bug in my salad!\" P ut punctuation marks before the rst quotation mark and insid e of the nal quotation mark. Quotation marks are also used around the names o f poems, song titles, short stories, magazine or newspaper articles, essays, speeches, chapter titles, and other short works. (Titles of movies, books, TV series, etc. are usually set in italics.) H er daughter would not stop singing \"Row, Row, Ro w Your Boat\" as they drove to the lake. My favorite poem is \"Wild Geese,\" by Mary Oliver. Practice S elect the best revision of the following sentences. 37. Do you think Ted remembered his book, pen, and pap e r? a.

Since the subject of the sentence, Julio, is a singular noun\u2014one person\u2014we need to use is (the sin- gular form of the verb to be). 7. Two members of the band are still back at the hot el. What is the subject of this sentence\u2014Two members or the band? It is two members. As a r esult, we need to use the verb are . 8. Everyone is supposed to be onstage right now! The word everyone may refer to a lot of people, but the word itself is singular. Therefore we need to use is. 9. Where are Julio and the guitar player? There are tw o subjects in this sentence: Julio and the gui- tar player. Therefore we need to use are (the pl ural form of the verb to be). 10. b. B ecause the sentence includes the phrase later today, we know that we need a future verb form. The sentence should read: Catherine will go to the store later today. 195195 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR 11. a. V isited is the simple past tense form of the verb to visit, which makes sense in this sentence because we know this happened yesterday, not last week or right now. 12. c. W hen a singular subject and a plural subject are connected by nor, the verb must agree with the closer subject\u2014in this case, the plural cous-ins. This choice, ap pear, is the correct verb form for a plural subject. 13. Whom ar e you taking to the dance? Here, the mystery person will be taken to a dance\u2014an action will be performed on him or her. There-fore the mystery person is an object, and we ne ed to use a pronoun that works with objects: whom. 14. Whoever is making that noise had better quiet d own! When deciding whether to use who/who- ever o r whom/whomever, you need to ask if the person in question is the subject of the sentence (performing the action) or the object (receiving the action). Here, the mystery person being yelled at is the subject of the sentence\u2014he or she is making the noise\u2014so we need to use whoever, a pronoun for subjects. If the person were the object, we'd need to use whomever, a pronoun for objects. 15. That man over there is the customer who com- plained about me to my boss. In the second part o f the sentence, the customer performs the action\u2014complaining\u2014so he or she is the sub-ject. We need to use who, a pronoun for s ubjects. 16. Who is taking you to the dance? The mystery person here is performing the action\u2014taking you to the dance. Therefore, he or she is the subject. We need to use a pronoun that works with subjects: who. 17. b. W e need a possessive pronoun that ts with Joe\u2014a singular male noun. That is his. 18. a. W e don't know the gender of the person who forgot to lock up the shoes and gym bag, but we know it is one person (someone is singu-lar). As a result, we need to use his or her (sin-gular possessive pronouns). 19. b. T hese possessive pronouns are used cor - rectly and make sense in this sentence. 20. a. M oving to Nevada is a dangling modier. We all know that it was Shira who moved to Nevada\u2014the truck didn't move to Nevada. But based on the structure of this sentence, moving to Nevada modies Shira's truck. The revision in this choice corrects that problem. 21. c. I n the original sentence, the word only is in the wrong spot, and this choice moves it to where it belongs, right before ten minutes. What's wrong with the original sentence? The word only modies the wrong thing; the sen- tence says that Tom only used the treadmill at the g ym. We know that this is not correct, of course. Tom surely did many things at the gym: he must have opened the front door, walked over to the machines, and selected a treadmill; maybe he changed into his gym clothes, drank some water, and said hello to a friend, too. 22. a. T he problem with the original sentence is that the phrase for more than 200 years modies the wrong thing\u2014it suggests that the general may have been in disguise for 200 years. This doesn't make any sense\u2014people don't live for 200 years! This choice correctly places for more than 200 years right before historians have won- dered\u2014it's the wondering that's been happen- ing for 200 years. 23. Subject: the w oman; Predicate: is waiting for Mr. Williams. This is a complete sentence: it expresses a complete idea and includes a subject and a predicate. Note that the subject is the woman, not the lobby\u2014the lobby isn't waiting for Mr. Williams. 196196 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR 24. Subject: Mr . Williams; Predicate: went down- stairs. This is a complete sentence: It expresses a c omplete idea and includes a subject and a predicate. 25. d. T his sentence uses a subordinating conjunc-tion\u2014wherever\u2014but wherever doesn't make se nse here. Here is a better use of wherever to combine two clauses: Wherever I go with Andy, he always seems to know someone. 26. b. T his revision tries to blend the clauses together with a semicolon, but in the process it chops out some key words. By itself, in the mid- dle of nowhere is not a clause and it doesn't mak e sense tacked on at the end with a semicolon. 27. c. T he problem with the original sentence is that it contains a series (apply to colleges, look for a better job, or staying in her current job), but the series is not parallel. The third item (staying in her current job) doesn't t with the rst two, and it also doesn't make sense with the phrase that introduces the series (she had to decide whether she was going to . . .). This revision is correct because the third item has been xed\u2014 it is now similar to the other two items (it starts off with the correct verb form, stay), and it makes sense logically in the sentence. 28. c. I n this sentence, They identies who or what is performing the action. It is therefore the sub-ject of the sentence. 29. a. T he rst part of this sentence, If you think it is a good team, would be a fragment if it stood alone. It makes us wonder, okay, if we think the Heat is a good team, then what? It needs an additional thought to form a complete sentence. 30. c. N ot going to happen today is a sentence frag-ment because it's missing a subject and a proper v erb. If we add these elements, we can turn it into a complete sentence. For example: The meet- ing is not going to happen today. 31. a. T his revision combines the rst clause (I'm going away on business) and the third clause (I'll be gone this weekend) into one complete sen-tence. This is a good idea, because these clauses c ommunicate related ideas\u2014they provide the background information that the speaker wants the listener to know before he or she asks for a favor. This choice also turns could you please watch the house into its own sentence by capital- izing could and adding a question mark (all q uestions should end with a question mark). The last sentence is now its own sentence, too. 32. d. T his sentence starts off with an independent clause and ends with a dependent clause. There is no reason for the comma. 33. b. B oth We're (meaning We are) and the pos- sessive family's are spelled correctly. 34. c. T he possessives Tom's and the possessive children's are spelled correctly, as is wasn't (a contraction meaning was not). 35. d. T he sentence should read: You're not going to x that car's problems without the proper tools. 36. c. I n this sentence, the phrase my friend from high school is an appositive: it gives additional information about the subject, Larry, but is not essential to the meaning of the sentence (that he lives next door). Commas are always used to set off appositives from the rest of the sentence. 37. d. T he sentence is correctly punctuated as is. 38. a. T here is no reason for commas in the date February 1994 (a month and year), but there should be a comma between the city and state (Duluth, Minnesota). 39. c. T his sentence requires a comma to set off the quote, quotation marks to surround the quote, a colon to introduce the list of three states (because it comes after an independent clause, I like vacationing in three states), and commas after the words Texas and New Mexico. 197197 - - LANGUAGE AND GRAMMAR Language and Grammar Review 1. b. T his sentence correctly changes thru to through, which is the proper spelling. 2. a. I t is hard to tell because the underlined sen-tence is not punctuated properly, but there are r eally two clauses here. The rst clause (As the economy improves) is a dependent clause, so it should be joined with a comma to the indepen-dent clause that follows (business travel across the nat ion is on the rise). 3. c. T he word they're should be changed to the possessive pronoun their. They're is a contrac- tion meaning they are. 4. b. T his sentence includes a list of three things: (1) free overnight stays, (2) late checkout, and (3) c omplimentary breakfast. In a series, there should be commas (or semicolons, in special situations) after every item except for the last one. This revision follows that rule. 5. a. T he problem with the sentence in the pas- sage is that it contains a series that is not paral- lel. There is a list of four items, and the rst thr ee items are worded in a similar way em is different (connect ing . . .). This revision c orrects the problem. It changes the fourth item, connecting with new people, to connect with new people, which matches the verb form in the other items. The phrase connect with new people also ts grammatically with the rst part of the sentence. The phrase connecting with new people didn't work. Why? Remove the rst three items of the series to see what we were really saying with connecting. The sentence would read: Millennials continue to be at the forefront of achieving work-life balance by using business travel to . . . connecting with new people across the globe, but this doesn't make any sense. 6. d. T he pronoun I and the proper noun Brook-lyn Nets are both correctly capitalized. 7. c. T his is correct punctuation and organization of a quote. 8. d. T his sentence calls for an object pronoun, explaining whom Melissa's friend asked for a ride. None of the choices are appropriate pronouns. 9. b. L et's rewrite this sentence: You are speaking to ________. The speaker (you ) is the subject\u2014 he or she is performing the action of the sen-tence (talking to someone). What we need here is an o bject pronoun, for the person being spo- ken to. Whom is an object pronoun and makes sense in this sentence. 198198 chapter8 The exTenDeD Response essay The Extended Response section of the GED\u00ae Reasoning through Language Arts (RLA) test is an essay question. You will be asked to read one or two passages and then answer a question, also called a prompt. The prompt will ask you to write an essay that takes a position on what you've read. Examples of topics include the pros and cons of all-day kindergarten or food choices in school cafeterias. You will be prompted to analyze both positions, determine which position is best supported, and include evidence from the readings to support your written position. You will have 45 minutes to read the given passage(s) and then write and edit your essay on the computer. Before you take the GED\u00ae RLA test, practice your typing skills. On exam day, you will have a lot to say, and you don't want to waste part of your 45 minutes hunting for letters on the keyboard. A good goal for taking the GED\u00ae RLA test is to be comfortable typing sentences on a computer. When you practice essay writing, set a timer for yourself so you can see what it feels like to type with the clock ticking. 199 n n n - - THE EXTENDED RESPONSE ESSAY Before y ou Write y our e ssay Producing a great essay for the GED\u00ae test requires a step-by-step process, and many of those steps take place before you write it. Take the time to work through this lesson, and you'll have a good founda-tion for writing your best essay on test day. eRasaB le W hiTeB oaRDs When you take the GED\u00ae test, you will be provided with an erasable whiteboard to jot down notes. These are especially useful during the extended response question, as you prepare to write your essay. If you need additional whiteboards during testing, you can request a fresh one and turn in the one that you've already used. You are allowed to have only one whiteboard at a time. Understanding the Prompt Writing an extended response essay requires you not only to analyze the passage(s) but also to respond to a specic prompt. Take a look at this sample prompt: pRoMpT In the following article, the pros and cons of wearing school uniforms are discussed. In your response, analyze both positions to determine which view is best supported. Use relevant and specific evidence from the passage to support your response. Type your response in the box; you will have approximately 45 minutes to complete it. To understand exactly what you're being asked to write about, carefully read the prompt and identify: The issue (pros and cons of wearing school unif orms) The description of what you are asked to do (analyze both positions; determine which view is best supported; use relevant and specic evidence from the passage to support your response) Instructions for completing the task (type your response in the box; you will have approximately 45 minutes to complete it) Reading the Passage(s) There's a natural tendency to want to rush into writ-ing the essay\u2014that's what you are being tested on, afte r all\u2014and to skimp on reading the passage(s). Avoid doing this. The only way to produce a good essay is to read the passage(s) carefully, understand it/ them, and pull out what you will need when you write. Follow these ve steps as you read the passage(s). At the end of the process, you will have good information and ideas to use as you write your essay. 1. Before you start to read, scan the passage(s) to get a sense of what the passage(s) is/are about and note how the information is organized. 2. Read the passage(s). Because you know you wil l denitely have to respond, as you read try to relate the information in the passage(s) to your own life experiences. 3. As you read, use your whiteboard to write do wn questions that you have about the con- tent. 4. Determine the author's main argument, and wr ite that down. Then quickly outline the main points that the author makes to support that argument and restate them in your own words. 200200 - - THE EXTENDED RESPONSE ESSAY n n 5. Evaluate the author's argument. Did he or she pr ovide good support or enough evidence for it? Why or why not? Does the way the author writes affect you emotionally? Why or why not? Writing a Thesis Statement The extended response requires you to take a stance on a topic and then back up this stance with specic evidence. To do this, start off your essay with a strong, clear claim\u2014also called a thesis statement\u2014and fol- low it with facts and ideas that support that claim. The goal of your essay is to convince the reader that your thesis statement is true through the evidence you provide. TaKe noTe Your thesis statement must be based on information that you read in the passage(s). (The supporting points that you use to back it up should also include information that you read in the passage(s), but they may be based on your own opinions and life experi - ences, too.) Read through these two examples of thesis statements: Public schools need to support healthy nutrition; the refore, vending machines that sell candy and soda to students should be forbidden. To protect the health and well-being of cats and dog s, pet owners have a responsibility to neuter their pets. Collecting Details from Passages To support your thesis, gather information from the passage(s) that will allow you to express a strong opinion. A good essay will include specic details that will help the reader understand your position. TaKe noTe On the GED\u00ae test, you must include evi - dence from the passage(s) that supports your thesis statement and also analyze evi- dence in the passage(s) that does not sup - port your position. As you jot down details from the passage(s) to use in your essay, ask the following questions: 1. Does this information support my thesis state ment? 2. Does this evidence persuade the reader to be lieve or agree with my position? The following is an example of a passage that pres-ents an issue (the pros and cons of school uniforms). We will analyze this passage in the next section. Write down notes, important details, and a thesis statement as you read. 201201 - - THE EXTENDED RESPONSE ESSAY The pR os anD Cons oF sC hool UniFo RMs FoR yoUR ChilD Although uniforms have been a mainstay of private schools, public schools jumped on the band - wagon in 1994, when the California school district of Long Beach implemented school uniforms. According to the Long Beach school district, within one year after the implementation of uni- forms, the fights and muggings at school decreased by 50%, while committed sexual offenses were reduced by 74%. Across the country, similar statistics abound; for example, at Ruffner Mid- dle School in Norfolk, Virginia, the number of discipline referrals decreased by 42% once uni-forms were enforced. Subsequently, fueled by these statistics, more schools across the country ar e implementing uniforms in public schools. Nonetheless, there are other statistics that argue that uniforms are not as beneficial as school administrators believe. Thus, the question still remains: Are public school uniforms good for your child? There are fundamentally two benets associated with school uniforms: a focus on learning, as well as a reduction of violence on campus. Many school administrators and parents believe that uni- forms create a better learning environment at school. First and foremost, students are not distracted by how they look and therefore pay more attention to learning at school. The peer pressures of styl- ish dressing with the best brands are alleviated, and students can focus more on their schoolwork, ra ther than on social appearances. In fact, the socioeconomic differences present among students are equalized with school uniforms, minimizing the pressure to t in with the right clothing choices. According to the publication School Administrator , the mandate of uniforms on campuses has reduced tardiness, skipped classes, suspensions, and discipline referrals. In addition, with the visual uniformity present across all students, school pride has increased. Similar to athletic team uniforms, dressing cohesively increases pride, unity, and a renewed commitment to the school. With uniforms, a more professional tone is set in school, encouraging students to take their studies more seriously. Uniforms are more expensive up front, as the parent must invest in all of the staples; however, as the school year progresses, there are fewer purchases that need to be made. Last, uniforms at school reduce the prevalence of violence, which is a major concern for many public schools. Outsiders who do not belong on campus are easily identied and thus do not pose a great threat to the students. Uniforms also reduce the cliques and gangs on school campuses. When it is not easy to identify members of gangs, the ghts and violence decrease. Students can no longer be distracted by who is wearing which gang color, and therefore, the campus is kept safer with less incidence of ghting. The opponents of public school uniforms, as outlined by the ACLU's argument for the First Am endment, argue that uniforms stifle a student's need for self-expression. Students need to be encouraged to embrace their individualism, and uniforms deny that self-expression. According to opponents of uniforms, even preschoolers should have input into their wardrobes, and the need to encourage personality, confidence, and independence grows more important as the student becomes older. Without the outlet of expression in their clothing choices, students may turn to inappropriate hairstyles, jewelry, or makeup. Denying students their ability to express individual-ism and belief in a subculture, whether preppy, hip-hop, punk, or jock, could stymie their transi-tion from childhood into adulthood. Controlling the socialization process could harm them as (continues ) 202202 - - THE EXTENDED RESPONSE ESSAY a dults; they may not be prepared for the real world, where people are indeed judged by their ap pearances. In addition, others argue that uniforms may not be comfortable for all students. As it is important to ensure that the student is comfortable in order to maximize learning outcomes, uniforms may stymie academic focus. Students cannot wear their uniforms outside of school, and thus, there is the double cost of both uniforms and a casual wardrobe. \u2014 Adapted from \"Public School Uniforms: The Pros and Cons for Your Child,\" by Grace Chen, April 23, 2008, publicschoolreview.com. organization of your e ssay A good GED\u00ae test essay starts with an introductory paragraph that presents the main idea, follows with body paragraphs that contain support for the main idea, and closes with a concluding paragraph. Writing Your Introduction Keep in mind these two goals as you write your introduction: 1. Clearly state your main point or thesis state-ment. As you write the body paragraphs, you can re fer to your introduction to make sure your evidence supports the thesis. 2. Present your plan to support your main point. For example, if you are going to refer to three po ints of evidence from the passage(s), briefly mention them in the introduction. This will give your essay some structure\u2014helpful for your readers, because they will know what to expect, and helpful for you, because you will have a built-in guide as you write the rest of the piece. It's also a good way to make sure up front that you will be able to defend your argument with evidence. If you can't nd evidence to s upport your claim, then you need to rethink your thesis stat ement. Problems to Avoid in Introductions 1. Don't mention how you plan to write your essay . Your position and supporting evidence should speak for themselves. Incorrect: I am going t o tell you why students in public schools should wear uniforms. I will pres-ent the best argument for this position that shows wh y this is a good thing to do. I will also explain why the information against school uniforms does not present a good argument. Correct: There are many benets that result from mandating student uniforms in public schools. These benets include an overall lower cost, the sense of school harmony they promote, and the respect that is associated with them. Evidence from school administrators, students, and parents sup - ports these advantages, which outweigh the nega - tives of mandating school uniforms. 2. Don't use meaningless or empty words to sound cle ver or repeat the same point using synonyms. Consider the following example: School uniforms are critical to student suc-cess. They are essential for helping students acc omplish their best in school. Uniforms play a signicant role in helping students have a positive experience in school. These three sentences all say the same thing! 203203 - - THE EXTENDED RESPONSE ESSAY 3. Don't make excuses for your writing. You want t o convey a clear, condent position to the reader. Don't start your essay with some-thing like the following: Although I'm not familiar with the debate over sc hool uniforms, I think I would probably say that it's a good idea for students to wear them. Building Your Argument To write the body of your essay, you will need to pro-vide support for your claim or thesis statement. Re turn to your notes to see what evidence you high- lighted as you read the passage(s). On the extended resp onse, it is okay to use evidence from your per - sonal experiences, but much of the essay should be based on evidence found in the reading passage(s) and on your analysis of this evidence. If the writer of the passage makes his or her own argument, you should also include an analysis of the author's argument, or arguments, in your essay. To earn the highest score possible, you should discuss whether you think the writer is making a good case, and why or why not. noTe Don't try to argue a claim if you can't fully support it. If you cannot find enough evi - dence from the passage(s) to back up your th esis, then you will have to develop a new one. A good way to arrange your evidence is in the order of strength: start with the weakest evidence and end with the strongest. In addition to listing details that support your thesis, you should also list details that go against your thesis and then talk about why you disagree with them. Arguments like this help strengthen your point. After you have grouped your supporting evi- dence using the erasable whiteboard, you will be rea dy to construct a simple outline to draft your essay. Constructing a Draft One method of constructing a draft, or the rst ver - sion of your essay, is to create a simple outline. You can d o this on the computer in the space provided for the essay and then erase it after you nish writing the essay. You might also want to create the outline on your personal whiteboard, which has the advantage of saving space on the computer screen. Begin by thinking about your thesis. Decide the stance y ou want to take, and write your thoughts into one complete sentence. For example, what thesis statement would you make for an essay about the school uniform passage? Every extended response essay should follow this basic str ucture: 1. Introduction (states thesis) 2. Body (explains and supports thesis with evi- d ence from the passage and your insights) 3. Conclusion (brings closure and restates thesis) Here is an example, using the passage about school unifo rms: Thesis statement: There are many benets that result from mandating student uniforms in public schools. Body paragraph(s): Make sure these include evidence from the text, not only your opinion: 1. D ecrease in negative behavior Evidence from the passage: Scho ol admin- istrators report a reduction in ghting, tardiness, and othe r discipline problems. 204204 - - THE EXTENDED RESPONSE ESSAY 2. Increase in learning Evidence from the passage: Scho ol admin- istrators and parents report a better focus on learning b ecause students are not distracted by the pressure to t in. 3. Professional, respectful atmosphere at school Evidence from the passage: Scho ols report an increase in school pride and commitment to school. Conclusion: Ev idence from school administrators and other experts supports these advantages, which out-weigh the negatives of mandating school uniforms. Sometimes three paragraphs\u2014an introductory parag raph, a body paragraph, and a concluding para- graph\u2014are enough to make your point, but you may nee d more (usually extra body paragraphs). noTe For an essay to be effective, each para - graph must be effective, too. This means that each paragraph must be well devel- oped. Each paragraph should have a mini-mum of three sentences, but it's usually ne cessary to write five to eight sentences to explain your thoughts adequately. Once you have a clear, detailed outline, you can begin to write your essay. As noted earlier, your introduc-tion should include your claim or thesis statement. He re is an example of an introductory paragraph: There are many benets that result from mandat-ing student uniforms in public schools. These be nets include an overall lower cost, the sense of school harmony they promote, and the respect that is associated with them. Evidence from school administrators, students, and parents supports these advantages, which outweigh the neg atives of mandating school uniforms. After you have composed your introduction, write the b ody of the essay to support your claim, and then add a conclusion paragraph that makes a nal com-ment and restates your thesis. WaR ning! You cannot copy and paste exact text from the passage(s) into the body of your essay without using quotation marks. If you do make this mistake, your essay will receive a score of 0! You are required either to include quotation marks or to paraphrase the points (put what the author says into your own words). example of an extended Response e ssay Now take a look at this great example of a high-scor - ing essay, which follows the structure we've discussed. The writer is responding to the prompt for the school uniform passage. pRoMpT In the following article, the pros and cons of wearing school uniforms are discussed. In your response, analyze both positions to determine which view is best supported. Use relevant and specific evidence from the passage to support your response. Type your response in the box; you will have approimately 45 minutes to complete it. 205205 - - THE EXTENDED RESPONSE ESSAY pRos anD Cons oF sC hool UniFo RMs There are many benefits that result from mandating student uniforms in public schools. These benefits include an overall lower cost, the sense of harmony they promote, and the respect that is associated with them. Evidence from school administrators, students, and parents supports these advantages, which outweigh the negatives of mandating school uniforms. As noted in the article by Grace Chen, evidence from schools in California and elsewhere revealed that when students were required to wear uniforms, there was a significant drop in nega - tive behaviors on campus. For example, one school district reported that after one year of stu-dents wearing uniforms, the number of fights and muggings went down by 50%. The publication School Administrator h ad similar findings: when students wore uniforms, there was a decrease in tardiness, skipping school, and even suspensions. School administrators and parents also report that when students are not focused on how they look or succumbing to pressure from their classmates to dress in a certain way, more atten- tion can be paid to the task of learning in the school environment. While Chen cites the opinion th at uniforms repress individual style, students have opportunities to express their style outside the school setting. Opponents also claim that there could be a greater financial cost to families if uniforms are required; however, in my experience, this is a weak argument. For example, in my school district, there is financial aid available to every family in need to help with the cost of uni-forms, and in some schools, uniforms are free to qualifying families. In addition, Chen notes that uniforms create \"a more professional tone . . . in school,\" saying that this practice encourages students to take pride in their school and creates a sense of com- munity. These are skills that young people need in adulthood whether they go on to college or en ter the workforce. If wearing school uniforms helps students at a young age to increase their awareness of some of the things that are important for college and career readiness, then this is something school districts need to consider. A young person's ability to transition successfully to adulthood requires far more than attentiveness to his or her individual style. Many workplaces have employee dress codes, and those who do not follow the company policy for appropriate dress may face termination. Therefore, school uniforms may actually help young people develop the mind-set they need to be effective team players in the workplace. Although some students may complain about the requirement of school uniforms, the evi- dence presented in this article strongly suggests that the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. Chen notes that school officials have data that prove the positive effects of uniforms: fewer behav- ior problems, an increase in school pride, and greater attention to learning. Based on this evi-dence, more districts should consider implementing uniforms in their schools. Notice that the fourth paragraph includes a phrase from the passage, and it's correctly enclosed by quo-tation marks. What are the three dots in the quote? The y are an ellipsis, which indicates that the essay writer removed one or more words from the original phrase. The original line in the passage is a mor e pro- fessional tone is set in school. This doesn't work gram-matically in the sentence in the essay, so the essay wr iter removed is set and replaced those two words with an ellipsis. 206206 - - THE EXTENDED RESPONSE ESSAY n n n n Also note that the writing style is formal and that the word choice is precise in order to convey spe- cic ideas. The Final s teps The sample essay you just read is the nal, submitted version of the essay. When you write your essay, you will probably need to revise your rst draft before you get to this stage. You'll want to read it over care-fully and make changes to improve it. Focus on impr oving the text (what you say) and style (how you say it), as well as xing grammar and language errors that you may not have noticed when you were writing. Evaluating Your Work Use this checklist to help you evaluate your rst draft to make revisions. Your response should: Introduce a clear point of view, distinguishing it from an opposing point of view as necessary. Develop the point of view and an opposing point of view fairly, give evidence for each, and point out the strengths and weaknesses of both. Provide a conclusion that supports the argument presented. Follow the rules of standard written English. Managing Your Time You will have 45 minutes to complete your extended response for the GED\u00ae RLA test. This requires careful planning and time management to read the passage(s) and then write your essay.

Take no more than 45 minutes to read the passage, write your essay, and then revise it. 211211 - - THE EXTENDED RESPONSE ESSAY ViolenT ViD eo gaM es\u2014 aRe They haRMFUl To yoU ng people? The debate over the effects of video games on the behavior of youths continues today with reports of school shootings and violent acts in urban neighborhoods. Violent video games are often cited as the culprit for increased violent behavior in youths. Some people contend that these games desensitize players to violence and teach children that violence is an acceptable way to resolve conflicts. Video game supporters state that research on the topic is unsound and that no direct relationship has been found between video games and violent behavior. In fact, some argue that violent video games may reduce violence by providing a safe outlet for aggressive and angry feelings. In testimony presented at a 2012 federal hearing addressing the regulation of the video game rating system, Cindy Marrix, a psychologist and researcher at the Media and Mind Institute at Wollash University, in Wollash, Idaho, stated there is overwhelming evidence that supports the link between violent video games and aggressive behavior in young people. Dr. Marrix stated that research shows that violent video games are more likely than other media to lead to aggressive behavior because of the repetitive nature of game activities and players' identification with vio-lent characters. Dr. Marrix also noted that the practice of being rewarded for many acts of violence may intensify a game player's learning of violent acts. She believes that electronic media play a signifi- cant role in the emotional and social development of youth. While there are many video games th at promote learning and cooperative behavior, studies suggest that the video games that include aggression, violence, and sexualized violence may have a negative impact on children. Research results reveal that violent video games do increase feelings of hostility and thoughts ab out aggression. Dr. Marrix contends that the entertainment industry must recognize the link between violent behaviors and violent video games, and that these games should depict the real-istic consequences of violence to show children that violence is not an effective means of resolv-ing conflict. While the concerns about the effects of violent video games are understandable, there are al so a number of experts who claim there is no link between video games and violence. After examination of the research evidence, several authorities have concluded that these studies do not scientifically validate the hypothesis that the games increase violence. In fact, millions of chil-dren and adults play these games without any ill effects. Researchers Dr. Erica Trounce and Dr. Jacob Smith state that concerns about current video games ar e really no different than those of previous generations regarding the new media of ear - lier times. Drs. Trounce and Smith state that research findings that claim violent video games cre-ate violent behaviors come from poorly conducted studies and sensational news reports. The findings of two recent studies were reported in 2014 in the scientific journal Behind the Brain . Participants of the first study were assigned to play either a violent or a nonviolent video game for two hours per day for 20 days. Although male participants were observed to have greater aggression during the time they played the violent game than female participants, the (continues ) 212212 - - THE study revealed no increase of real-life aggression in players of the violent games. Re sults of the second study indicated that a predisposition to respond to certain situations with acts of aggression, family violence, and male gender were predictive of violent crime, but expo- sure to violent video games was not. These results suggest that playing violent video games does not demonstrate a significant risk for future violent acts. W orldwide video game sales are predicted to reach $73.5 billion in 2013. As games get mo re complex and lifelike, the discussion over whether children should be allowed to be exposed to violent video games will continue. Read the passage and construct an essay that addresses the following question: Do violent video games pro- mote violent behavior in youths? In your response, anal yze both positions to determine which is better supported. Use relevant and specic evidence to sup-port your ESSAY 216216 - - THE EXTENDED RESPONSE ESSAY extended Response practice s ample e ssays Sample Score 2 Response There is strong reason to believe that violent video games help create a culture of violence among Amer - ica's youths. The playing of violent video games can cause pla yers to blur the line between fantasy and reality and make them believe there are no conse-quences for violent actions. Evidence from a variety of sources such as psychologists and scientic researchers shows that we must take steps to curb children's exposure to violent video games. As the testimony of Dr. Cindy Marrix makes clear , violent video games have a much greater impact on the behavior of players than other forms of media. Beyond the \"repetitive nature of game activities and players' identication with violent characters\" that she mentions, I would also argue that the interactive component of video games makes them more dan-gerous than violent movies or television. This is be cause players actively contribute to the games' vio- lent story lines, whereas movies and television are passiv e viewing experiences. Additionally, as Dr. Mar- rix contends, the system of rewarding game players for violent actions both desensitizes players to vio-lence and lends positive associations to violent acts. While the passage contains evidence against the link b etween violent video games and violent behav- ior, I do not believe it is as strong as the argument re presented by Dr. Marrix. Most signicantly, the study published in Behind the Brain does not seem to take into consideration the long-term effects of play-ing violent video games over a sustained amount of time. Perhaps players' levels of aggression do not rise after a few days' or weeks' worth of play, but what about over the course of 10 or 15 years? Most game players I know, whether they play violent or nonvio-lent games, have been doing so since early childhood. Ev en if many years spent playing such games does not result in violent behavior, at the very least these games remove the danger from violent behavior and make it app ear almost normal. This can't be good for players' abilities to empathize with victims of violence or fully grasp the problem of violence in the world today. Dr. Marrix is right to call for increased vigilance on the part of both the game makers and the general public when it comes to violence in video games. As the passage predicts, these games will only get more lifelike with time, raising further questions about the relationship between simulated and real violence. Factors such as a player's psychological health and family background denitely play a part in his or her tendencies toward violence, but the influence of interactive media on a child's emotional development cannot be ignored. About This Essay This extended response is a Score 2 because it con-tains an argument that is clearly connected to the pr ompt. The author does this by using evidence from the passage and attributing it correctly (this means that the writer explained who or what is the source of the evidence). The writer makes reasonable infer - ences, makes reasonable claims, and organizes his or her points in a logical way. He or she looks at both sides of the debate with fairness and objectivity, add-ing personal observations only when they are relevant to the response. The language, style, and tone of the essay remain formal throughout. Sentence structure is clear and precise, and the writer has a varied vocab-ulary. He or she follows basic grammar rules, includ-ing proper capitalization and punctuation. Sample Score 1 Response This essay discusses violence and video games. In my opinion violence is a problem today but video games don't make it any worse. Video games can even help with hand eye coordination and reflexes. The rst source, Dr. Marrix, discusses why she thinks that video games lead to violence. She says that people who play video games are more aggressive 217217 - - THE EXTENDED RESPONSE ESSAY than people who don't and that they have a hard time telling the difference between what's real and what isn't. Maybe there is some truth to this but I know people who have played video games for years and they are not violent. I think it depends on people's families, if their families are good and teach them not to be aggressive and violent then they should be able to play video games without resulting in social vio-lence. Dr. Marrix believes that players \"identify\" with viole nt characters and that this makes them want to act like the characters in real life, but I think it's more like the second source, Doctor Trounce, says: \"violent behaviors come from poorly conducted studies and sensational news reports.\" What she means is that the news media is responsible for blowing up the prob-lem of violent video games to sensationalize a story. It real ly has no grounding in reality. I also agree with the study in Behind the Brain magazine, that states that there is no increase in real-life aggression when people play video games. This refutes Dr. Marrix's point that there is a link between the two. The study also backs up what I said about the importance of family in raising nonviolent children. The article states that people are going to spend \"73.5 b illion\" dollars on games by the end of 2013. This alone is enough to show that games are not going away and that they are very difcult to regulate because they take up such a large part of the econ-omy. Dr. Marrix suggests they change the content of the g ames, but that will be difcult because so many people buy them. Instead they should let the consum-ers decide if they can handle the content of the games. Games lik e Grand theft Auto can even help people's driving abilities and even pilots sometimes train on simulators so it is proven that simulated electronic media can have positive value in society. Plus the magazine study shows that it is usually only males that have the problem with violence and video games, not the entire population. In conclusion I do not see an established link between violence and video games, at least not enough so that we have to change our national policy toward games, like Dr. Marrix sug gests. About This Essay This extended response is a Score 1 because the argu-ment has some connection to the prompt, but the autho r wanders in making his or her point. He or she does not follow a logical progression to explain his or her argument. The writer does not analyze the evi-dence from the text in depth, and little is done to show ho w it connects to the author's thesis. The essay writer makes similar points repeatedly, using a tone that wavers between formal and casual. There are run-on sentences, some errors in punctuation and capitalization, inaccurate quotes, and awkward tran-sitions between parts of the essay. Sample Score 0 Response The article says video games lead to violence I agree cuz video games r violent & lotsa people play em that r violent. i'd say ban all the video games cuz they lead to violence! The game Call of Duty's very violent, I know ppl who play it n the grafx r super real look-ing. Not good for society to have ppl playin these games. in the article it sez ppl get aggressive when they play too many games. I would agree wit this, they have trouble telling whats real and whats fake. The dr. in the article sez these games have \"negative impact\" which is true if you've ever seen how violent the games can b. other parts in the article talk bout how the games arent that violent that ppl can play them w/o being violent but I dont know, I think they raise aggression in players. games once were simpler, not so violent, but now theyre super violent, the doc-tors in the article even think so. ppl are gonna spend \"7.53 b illion\" on games the article states, so its a big- ger problem then really anyone can handle at this po int . . . its one of the biggest parts of the media and ppl will nd ways to get their games. its to bad b/c I think its bad for society to have all these people play-ing so many games not thinking about real problems 218218 - - THE EXTENDED RESPONSE ESSAY in society like war etc. but I dunno I dont think theres a solution rite now . . . sad that ppl become so violent with games. About This Essay This extended response is a Score 0 because it has lit-tle or no connection to the prompt, follows no logical pr ogression, and includes little evidence from the passage. There is very little analysis of the issue or of the studies mentioned in the passage; while there is a ve ry general thesis, it is not fully explained. The author uses slang and shorthand spellings (for instance, \"sez\" and \"dunno\") and writes in a tone that is too casual. There are many errors in spelling, capi-talization, punctuation, and basic grammar rules, and the d ollar amount is quoted inaccurately. These pre- vent the reader from fully understanding what the wr iter is trying to say. 219219 TESTPREP_09RLA_199-220.indd 220 PM PA R TGED\u00ae SciEncE TESTIII The GED\u00ae Science test focuses on using critical thinking and reasoning skills along with the fundamen- tals of scientic reasoning and application of science practices in real-world scenarios.

Short Answer Questions The GED\u00ae Science test includes short answer ques-tions. In these, you will be asked to respond with a shor t paragraph to information presented in a pas- sage or graphic. Short answer questions are not timed separ ately, so you will need to watch your time when writing your response. It is recommended that you spend approximately 10 minutes on each short answer question. Answering GED\u00ae Science Test Questions As noted before, the test items may include a scenario that has one question or multiple questions associ-ated with it. For example, you may read a passage abou t predator-prey population dynamics and review a graph that shows the numbers of rabbits and lynx over time. You then may be asked several questions about the passage and the data in the graph. Other prompts will include charts, diagrams, tables, and brief text passages. Problem-solving questions will ask you to app ly your understanding of information presented as part of the question. Questions of this type could require you to: interpret results or draw conclusions based on results analyze experimental flaws or logical fallacies in arguments make a prediction based on information provided in the question select the best procedure or method to accom - plish a scie ntic goal select a diagram that best illustrates a principle apply scientic knowledge to everyday life use the work of renowned scientists to explain everyday global issues 222222 - - PART III: GED SCIENCE TEST n n n Test Topics The science topics covered on the GED\u00ae Science test are: Physical science\u201440% of the questions Life science\u201440% of the questions Earth and space science\u201420% of the questions On the GED\u00ae Science test, physical science includes high school physics and chemistry, life science deals with subjects covered in high school biology classes, and earth and space science questions cover high school earth science and astronomy. You should be familiar with the concepts listed and use the content review chapters following to help you refresh your knowledge of them. nOTE All the information you will need to answer the questions on the GED\u00ae Science test is actually within the passages themselves. The GED \u00ae test questions test your ability to read and comprehend scientific informa - tion; they do not t est your memory or knowledge of science. The review chapters in this book will gi ve you a solid background of the sciences you must know to succeed on the exam, so you can read the passages with ease and clarity. The science review chapters in this book will also give you practice reading sci-entific language, and the practice questions throughout will test your ability to compre- hend what you have read, just as the GED\u00ae test asks you to do. Science Pract ices and Review c hapters In the next chapter, we will review the science prac- tice skills in more detail. These skills, as noted previ-ously, are used in each question to measure the crit ical thinking and reasoning ability necessary for scientic inquiry. These skills include comprehend-ing scientic presentations, designing investigations or experiments, reasoning from data, and using prob- ability and statistics in a scientic context. Reviewing these skil ls is key to doing well on the GED\u00ae Science test. The other chapters in this section of the book incl ude a basic review of the three science areas cov- ered on the GED\u00ae Science test: life science, physical scienc e, and earth and space science. Let's get started with reviewing what you need to d o well on the GED\u00ae Science test! 223223 TESTPREP_10_MATH_PTIII_221-224.indd 224 3/31/15 4:56 PM chapter9 SCienCe PraCtiCeS Science practices can be best described as the skills necessary for understanding scientic concepts using critical thinking and reasoning, as well as reading comprehension and quantitative analysis, or math- e matical comprehension. In short, you can think of them as comprehension, analysis, and solving skills. While it's relatively easy to simply describe these skills, it is also still necessary for you to review them in preparation for the test in the same way that runners train their muscles in preparation for a marathon. So let's start doing some laps, or reviewing some of these specic skills! All answers and explanations for the practice questions throughout are at the end of the chapter. Comprehending Scientific Presentations Scientic data and presentations are encountered every day in life, as well as on the GED\u00ae Science test. You might nd scientic concepts and data in a newspaper or magazine article, a TV program, or an advertisement. Regardless, there are several important things that you must be able to do so that you can understand what is being presented: 225 n n n - - SCIENCE PRACTICES Understand the textual information being pre- sented. What is the presenter trying to say by his o r her words or language? Do you know the meaning of the scientic terms (jargon) being used? Understand any symbolic or mathematical rep- r esentations. Scientists often use symbols or abb reviations to represent scientic quantities (e.g., forces, chemical formulas, biological quanti-ties). In many presentations, they use mathemati-cal equations that represent the relationships be tween scientic phenomena. Understand visual information. Do you remem-b er the saying that \"a picture is worth a thousand wo rds\"? Scientists often present information visually in the form of graphs, tables, and dia-grams. Visual representations shorten the amount of text or spoken words necessary to convey information and can clearly show relationships between scientic phenomena. These three skills encompass comprehending a scien-tic presentation as a whole and are necessary for unde rstanding the questions you may be asked in the GED\u00ae Science test. Let's look at these in detail. Understand the Textual Information Being Presented In life and on the GED\u00ae Science test, scientic infor - mation is often presented in written form. On the test, you will be asked to read short passages full of scientic information. Within these passages, there will be a wealth of important ideas that you must be able to recognize. There may be obstacles to recogniz-ing the ideas (such as unfamiliar vocabulary terms); how ever, there will also often be clues to help you navigate around these obstacles. As an example, read the following passage and co nsider how you would analyze the information in it. anatOMY OF MUSCLeS Muscles are made of bundles of cells wrapped in connective tissue called fasci - cles. Each bundle contains many cylindrical mu scle cells or muscle fibers. Like other cells, muscle fibers have mitochondria that provide energy, a plasma membrane that separates the inside and outside of the cell, and endoplasmic reticulum, where proteins are made. However, muscle cells are differ - ent from other cells in several ways. First, mu scle cells have more than one nucleus. Second, the muscle cell's plasma membrane surrounds bundles of cylindrical myofibrils that contain protein filaments and regularly folds into the deep parts of the fiber to form a transverse tubule or T-tubule. Third, the muscle cell's endoplasmic sarcoplasmic reticulum; it is regularly structured, envelops the myofibrils, and ends near the T-tubule in sacs called termi- nal cisternae. Here are some tips to help you with analyzing this information: 1. Look at the title. The title tells us that the passage is going to be abou t the structure or anatomy of muscles. 2. Look at patterns in the information, such as patte rns in the subjects. The subjects of the sentences all have muscle in co mmon. The pattern of muscle as the subject of each sentence also provides a clue as to the subject of the entire passage. So, what do you think is the main purpose of this passage? The main purpose of this passage is to describe the structure of muscles. 226226 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES n n 3. Look for details in the sentences and note them o n scratch paper. One detail is that the second sentence mentions that bund les contain many cylindrical cells. 4. Look for similarities and differences in the info rmation. The fth sentence of the passage states, Fir st, muscle cells have more than one nucleus. This sentence shows one of the differences between muscle cells and other cells. 5. Use context clues (called, or) t o dene unfa- miliar terms. . . . bundles of cells wrapped in connective tissue cal led fascicles. The word called connects the term with its denition. . . . many cylindrical muscle cells or muscle bers. The word or connects the term bers with another more familiar term, cells. 6. Note information set off by commas and by that c lauses. For example, a plasma me mbrane that separates the inside and outside of the cell reveals that the function of the plasma membrane is to sepa-rate the inside from the outside of the cell. Note that each sentence provides more details about the s ubject. You may need to write details down on scratch paper, especially for long reading passages. By looking at details in each sentence, you can gather important information. GED\u00ae test questions often focus on details to assess your comprehension of the passage. Practice 1. According to the passage, what is the shape of a musc le cell? a. sphere b. cylinder c. disc d. cube Notice that the passage also describes both how mus-cle cells are like other cells and how they are different fro m other cells. There are clues in the sentences: Lik e other cells, muscle bers reticulum. However, muscle cells are different from other cells in s everal ways. (The next sentences detail the ways that muscle cells are different.) Looking at how the information is similar and how it is diff erent can help you interpret the main ideas of the information presented. The GED\u00ae Science test often assesses whether you can distinguish differences stated in scientic presentations. Practice 2. Which is a difference between a muscle cell and another t ype of cell? a. Only muscle cells have mitochondria. b. The plasma membrane separates the inside fro m the outside of the cell. c. Muscle cells have more than one nucleus. d. Muscle cells do not have endoplasmic re ticulum. Understand Symbols, Terms, and Phrases in Scientific Presentations The GED\u00ae Science test also uses symbols (scientic and mathematical), chemical formulas, and equa-tions (mathematical, chemical) to present informa-tion. Since you won't be supplied with a science fo rmula sheet on test day, any mathematical equa- tions will have to be dened in context. Let's look at an example. 227227 n n n - - SCIENCE PRACTICES LiGHt W aVe S anD tH eir Pr OPertieS In the late seventeenth century, Isaac Newton explained light as consisting of particles. But in the early twentieth century, physicists began explaining light not as a particle, but rather as a wave. A wave is a periodic oscillation. The shape of a wave starts from a zero level and increases to the highest point or crest. Then it decreases past zero to its lowest level or trough. From the trough, it rises again to zero and another crest. This wave pattern repeats itself over time. The wave has three properties that describe it: amplitude, wavelength, and frequency. Amplitude (A) is the distance from the zero point to the crest of the wave and has the SI unit of meters (m). Wavelength (Q) is the distance from the peak of one wave to the peak of the next wave or the trough of one wave to the trough of the next wave; Q has the International System of Units (SI) unit of meters (m). The frequency (S) is the number of wave cycles per unit time; the SI unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz). The speed of a wave is the product of the wavelength and the frequency. In the case of a light wave, the speed of light (c) is a constant (3 \u00d7 108 m/s) and is described by this formula: c = QS. The wavelengths of light vary from extremely short gamma rays (Q < 10 -12 m) to very long radio waves (Q > 1 m). This passage is loaded with many concepts, terms, and symbols, and an equation: n New terms: wave , periodic, oscillation, crest, trough, amplitude, wavelength, frequency A, Q, S, c Units: m, Hz, m/s Equation: c = QS M ost of the terms are clearly dened in sentences of the passag e. For example, we are told the specic meanings of wave , amplitude, wavelength, and fre- quency. The terms cr est and trough we can get by the word or, which relates the term to its meaning\u2014for example, to the highest point or crest and to its lowest level or trough. The terms periodic and oscillation you will either know or have to think about or deduce from the reading and the sentence that states, This wave pattern repeats itself over time. Symbols and units are often shown in parenthe- ses after their rst mention. Notice that the formula is stated in words (The spee d of a wave is the product of the wavelength and the frequency) and in mathematical symbols (c = QS). Let's look at another example. COMBinatiOn reaC tiOn Oxygen is a very corrosive substance and will combine with many other substances or oxidize other substances. A common exam- ple is that of a piece of iron left out in the air. Over time, the iron rusts. The rust is a chemical change and can be described by a chemical reaction. Four atoms of solid iron (Fe) combine with three molecules of gas- eous oxygen (O2) from the air to form two molecules of solid iron oxide (Fe2O3). The chemical reaction can be written by this chemical equation: 4Fe(s) + 3O2(g) q 2Fe2O3(s) This class of chemical reaction is called a combination reaction. 228228 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES The terms oxidize and combination reaction may be unfamiliar. You can get the meaning of oxidize from the rst sentence, Oxygen is a very corrosive substance and will combine with many other substances or oxi- dize other substances. Ox idize thus means to combine with oxygen, and the two words sound similar. Similarly, a comb ination reaction is one where molecules combine together. You can get this from the word combine in the fth sentence, where the chemical reaction is described. Practice Average KE (1021 J) 6 4 3.

Visual scient ic presentations often take the form of charts and graphs. On the GED\u00ae Science test, you may be required to understand a graphic like a diagram or table and put its meaning into words. You need to be able to restate or translate information into different formats. When you see this type of presentation, rst determine the purpose. What is it trying to illustrate or convey? Graphs Simply put, a gr aph is a diagram that shows a rela- tionship between two or more things. For example: The change in the average kinetic ener gy of gas molecules versus absolute temperatur e 12 10 8 2 0 0 100 200 300 400 500 Absolute T emperatur e (K) Using the title and headings, you should be able to identify that this graph represents the relationship between the average kinetic energy (KE) of gas mole - cules and abso lute temperature. What do you think the numbers on the graph represent? In this graph, the numbers on the horizontal (rig ht-to-left) axis, or x-axis, represent the tempera- ture in degrees Kelvin (K), and the numbers on the ve rtical (down-to-up) axis, or y-axis, represent the average kinetic energy (KE) of gas molecules. It's important to note the axis labels. Looking at the v ertical or y-axis, for example, you see that the numbers are labeled 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. But if you look at the axis label, each number represents 10 21 joules (J), not whole numbers. This distinction could be very important if you were asked to answer ques-tions based on the graph. The points are plotted on the g raph and connected by a line to show the linear, or direct, relationship between these two factors. The graph in this example correlates just two things. However, a graph can correlate more than two things at a time. When this happens, the additional data sets are usually graphed in another color or pat-tern to avoid confusion. If there is more than one 229229 - - pH __________ SCIENCE PRACTICES data set or more than one variable, a legend will help you interpret the graph. It will list the symbols, col- ors, or patterns used to label a particular data set. For example, in the following graph the legend lists at mospheric CO2, seawater pCO2, and seawater pH. A look at the vertical axes and the legend tells you that this graph shows the correlation between the changes in carbon dioxide (CO 2) levels in the atmo- sphere and the ocean over time, as well as the pH of seawat er over time. Tables and Charts Tables have horizontal rows and vertical columns. T he data entries in a single row of a table or chart usually have something in common. The same is true for the data entries in a single column. Charts are often used to show trends. Look for changes in numerical values to spot those trends. The following chart detailing the pH scale uses images and numbers to demonstrate what the differ - ent pH numbers actually mean. The chart has an arr ow that describes a continuum of conditions from acidic through neutral to basic, and there is a color scale that shows this continuum. There are three col-umns of numbers. One shows the pH of a substance. The other two show the concentrations of hydrogen ions (H+), one with numbers in scientic notation and the other in actual decimal numbers. Note that the symbol for hydrogen ions (H+) is used but not dened. Some abbreviations, like chemical symbols, are often assumed. Practice 4. Look at the pH scale. What is its range? 5. Notice that the concentrations of hydrogen ions c orrespond to values of pH. If a chemist measures a solution with a pH value of 9, what is the hydrogen ion concentration? a. 10 9 moles per liter b. 109 moles per liter __1c. mole per liter9 d. 9.0 moles per liter 230230 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES 6. From the arrow on the left, notice that acidic substanc es have pH values less than 7, while basic substances have pH values greater than 7. If a chemist measures that a solution has a pH value of 5.5, this indicates the solu-tion is n acidic. n alkaline. n neutral. Diagrams Diagrams are often used to show processes on the GED\u00ae Science test. In the following diagram of the water cycle, you can see that there are three main places for water to be exchanged among the oceans and rivers, the atmosphere, and the ground. Pay attention to any labeled features and arrows. Gener - ally, arrows connect processes. In this case, arrows show the direction of water flow, and the terms name the processes.

Which way does water move during inltr ation? a. from air into the ground b. from ground up to the surface c. from surface down into the ground d. from surface into the air 231231 n n n n n n n n - - SCIENCE PRACTICES The key to understanding any type of scientic pre- sentation is reading and looking carefully and criti-cally. This type of careful evaluation will allow you to inter pret which pieces of information go together, to determine relationships, and to clarify explanations. Designing i nvestigations Good scientic investigations begin with a question that often asks What if?, How?, or What effect will something have? The question should be one that can be investigated through experimentation and will then yield data. The experiment should also be repeatable. This allows other people to replicate the experiment to verify that the results stay the same. On the GED\u00ae Science test, you will be provided descrip tions of an experiment in a reading passage and the results in a table or in graph form. From the description, you will be asked to evaluate the design of the experiment. You will also be asked about the results and conclusions from the experiment based on the results. So, it is important that you know how scientic investigations work. Scientic investigations are hypothesis driven. A hyp othesis is a predictive answer to a question. It is an explanation on trial, one that can be tested. Deduc-tive reasoning is used to test a hypotheses. The test is acc omplished by designing and conducting an exper - iment. The experiment yields results (data). If the expe riment was designed and conducted correctly and the data t what was predicted by the hypothesis, then the experimenter must conclude that the hypothesis was correct. Otherwise, the experimenter must reject the current hypothesis and change it or form a new one. This scientic method is the basis of science. No hypothesis is accepted just because the scientist or others believe it is true; it must be testable and withstand experimental trial by many experi-ments conducted by different scientists before it is acc epted. To evaluate these scientic investigations, ask these quest io ns: What was the hypothesis? What was the independent variable? What was/were the dependent variable(s)? What were the other variables, and were they controlled? Were the measurement methods appropriate to w hat was being measured? Was the number of samples adequate? Overall, was the experimental design appropriate t o test the hypothesis? Let's look at the scientic method as it applies to expe riments and experimental design topics on the GED\u00ae Science test. Identify Possible Sources of Error and Change an Investigation to Remove the Error In science, the word error doesn't always mean mis- take; it might mean that there is uncertainty in the design. A source of error is any factor that could affect the outcome of the investigation. There are numer - ous possibilities for error in any experiment, so you will want to focus on the factors that matter the most. When evaluating the design of an experiment for e rrors, ask yourself these questions: Is the hypothesis of the experiment testable? For e xample, a teenage student wants to assess a claim that a new acne product improves the condition of the skin. If the student merely takes the word of celebrity endorsers, does that mean the prod-uct works well? If the student conducts an experi-ment to measure the incidence of acne upon treat ment with the product, then that is a way to test the hypothesis. 232232 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES n n n n n _____________________________________ _____________________________________ _____________________________________ Does what the experimenter measured reflect what is predicted by the hypothesis? For example, if the hypothesis predicts that a treatment for acne reduces the incidence of blemishes, then does the investigator measure the number of blemishes over an area of the skin with time or the rate at which blemishes disappear? Does the experiment have a control group? A c ontrol is an experimental treatment where all the variables that affect the experimental group are the same except one\u2014the one that is testing the hypothesis. For example, in an experiment to test acne medication, there might be a group of people who do not receive the acne medication but who are studied for the same amount of time, eat the same type of foods, are the same age and sex, and so on. The results from the experimental group are compared to those of the control group to test the hypothesis. Is the experimental method specied in enough de tail so that another investigator could repeat the experiment? Remember that experiments must be able to be repeated by others and must produce the same results so that the hypothesis can be evaluated. In the example of acne medica-tion, does the experimental procedure specify how m uch medication should be applied to the skin and how often? Does the procedure mention anything about how often the subjects should wash their faces? Are there enough subjects or samples in each g roup to represent a more general population? For example, if the acne medication study looks at only four people (one teenage male and three teenage girls), are these groups sufcient to repre-sent the larger population of teenagers? Is the data gathered accurately and precisely? F or example, in the acne study, does the investiga- tor count the number of blemishes, note their size, note the area over which they occurred, or measure the length of time that they remained visible? Practice Read the following experimental design carefully. Cr itically review it to identify possible sources of error. Then, explain how that source of error would have affected the results. Think about specic things that can change the end result of the experiment. Meat tenD eriZ er exPeriM ent A group of students wants to know what effect meat tenderizer will have on starches, fats, and proteins. The group hypothesizes that meat ten- derizer will break down proteins but not starches or fats. They formulate the following experi- mental design: 1. Add water to six jars. 2. Add 9 grams of meat tenderizer to th ree of the jars of water, and stir until dissolved. 3. Place one sample of star ch , of fat, and of protein in each of the three jars that contain meat tenderizer. 4. Place one sample of star ch , of fat, and of protein in the three remain-ing jars. 5. Put lids on all six jars. 6. Observe changes after 24 hours. 9. What possible sources of errors do you see in this desig n? Is the hypothesis stated adequately to make a predictable result? Write your response on the lines below. Look at the rst step of the experimental desig n. Is there something not specied? 11. What about step 2? Is there something not spe cied? 12. What is unclear about steps 3 and 4? 13. What is unclear about step 6? Identify and Refine Hypotheses for Investigation Asking questions and dening problems are essential to the investigative process. Once those questions have been asked, the next step is trying to nd and investigate the answer. A hypothesis is a prediction, an attempted answer to the question being investigated. A hypoth-esis attempts to predict the outcome of the experi-ment and suggests one or more possible reasons for the r esults. A good hypothesis should be based on observations and prior knowledge. Consider this example: SLeeP ineSS exP eriM ent Ruby and Mary are identical twins. They are often sleepy at noontime while attending their science class. They want to know why they frequently fall asleep at this time of day. Possible explanations might include: n n n n n Eating a big lunch right before sci- ence class every day makes the twins sleepy. The classroom is too warm. The twins ar e less engaged in this class because they sit at the back of the room, instead of at the front as in the rest of their classes. The science teacher has a monoto-nous voice that Mary and Ruby find boring. Ruby and Mary become tir ed at noontime every day. Each of these possible explanations for the twins fall- ing asleep in class is a potential hypothesis. A hypoth-esis should be stated in a way that allows you to make a p rediction that can be investigated by experiments or more observation. Proposing more than one hypothesis can be a good scientic practice. Last, hypotheses can be eliminated\u2014but not co nrmed\u2014with 100% certainty. Let's rephrase two of the possible explanations into q uestions to show how they might be tested. 234234 - a big lunch right before science class every day makes the twins sleepy. Question 1: Does eating a big lunch before sci- ence class make them sleepy? Hypothesis 1: If the twins become sleepy be cause they eat a big lunch before the noon class, then post-poning lunch should make them less slee py. Suggested Expe riment: Ruby postpones lunch until sci-ence is over at 1 P.M., whereas Mary still eats lunch at 11 A.M. Predicted Res ult: Ruby should be less tired and Mar y should still be sleepy in sci- ence class. Notice the . f ormat of the two hypothe- ses. It is not required that you format a hypothesis this wa y. However, it can provide you with a simple way to make sure that your hypothesis ts the criteria of a testable prediction. Practice Try this example. DOG FOOD exP eriM ent Jim has two overweight dachshunds. He sees an advertisement for a new reduced-calorie dog food that claims to allow the dogs to eat normally but still lose weight. 14. Propose a hypothesis to test the claim in the advertisement. What is the hypothesis, sug- gested experiment, and predicted result? Possible Explanation: The twins are less engaged in this class because they sit at the back of the room, instead of at the front as in the rest of their classes. H ypothesis: Question 2: Are Mary and Ruby less engaged in this class b ecause they sit at the back of the room, instead of at the front as in the rest of their classes? Hypothesis 2: If the twins become sleepy in the noo n class because they sit in the back of the room, then moving to the front of the room should make them less sleepy. Suggested Expe riment: Ruby moves to the front of the ro om, while Mary remains in the back. Predicted Res ult: Ruby should be less tired and mor e alert than Mary, and Mary should be sleepy during the sci-ence class. Suggested experiment: Predicted result: Identify and Interpret Variables in Investigations On the GED\u00ae Science test you might be asked to identify the different variables in an investigation, so understanding and being able to spot these variables are an important skill. Variables are factors in an 235235 n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n - - SCIENCE PRACTICES experiment that can be changed, measured, or controlled: Independent variables are the manipulated vari- ab les. They are the factors that will be intention- ally changed during the investigation to nd out what eff ect they have on something else. Usually, time is an independent variable because the investigator can always decide how long to look at something. Dependent variables are the responding vari- ab les. These are the factors that are observed and measure d to see if they are affected by the change made in the independent variable. Controls are variables that must be kept exactly the same t o make sure that they do not affect the dependent variable. WeeD Ki LLer exP eriM ent James wants to know how effective a weed killer is in preventing the growth of dandeli - ons. James sets up an experiment with the following procedur es to test the effective- ness of the weed killer. 1. Take two identical areas of grass and label them 1 and 2. 2. Apply the weed killer to ar ea 2 . 3. Seed both areas with the same num-ber of dandelion seeds. 4. Water the areas daily with the same amount of water. 5. Expose the areas to the same amount of sunlight and tempera- ture. 6. Once they bloom, count the num-ber of dandelions in each area once a day for one week. 7. Record the results. In this experiment: The independent variable is the weed killer. It is the manipulat ed factor that is being tested because James wants to nd out what effect it has on something else. The dependent variable is the number of dande- lio ns growing in the areas of grass. The number of dand elions is the responding variable, the fac- tor that is observed and measured to see if it is affec ted by the changes made by the presence or absence of the weed killer. There are six controlled variables\u2014the identical ar eas of grass, amounts of dandelions seeded, amounts of water used daily, lighting and tem-perature, and time of investigation. Identify Strengths and Weaknesses of Investigation Designs Experimental designs are not just about a list of pro- cedures. It is important to understand the weaknesses and the st rengths of a design. While a well-written list of procedures can be a strength of a scientic investi-gation, there are more factors at work. For example: Does the investigation have a clear purpose? Can the stated problem really be investigated using the designed procedures? Are the objectives measurable? Are the planned procedures appropriate to the project? Can the data be analyzed in a meaningful way? What are the nancial and time costs involved in the experiment and analysis? Is there any potential harm to the subjects? Is the investigation repeatable by others? Are there safeguards to minimize bias and invalidity? 236236 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES n n n n n n n Here is a description of a student's scientic investi- gation. Read it to identify the strengths and weak-nesses of the design. Look at each sentence and try to analyze w hat might help or hurt the investigation. VitaM inS anD GrOWt H exP eriM ent Andrew is studying the effect of vitamins on the growth of mice. His hypothesis is that mice receiving a daily vitamin will grow faster than those not receiving the vitamin. To test his hypothesis, he follows these pro - cedures. He obtains two identical mice and pla ces them in the same cage. He feeds them the same food and the same amount of water. One mouse gets 5 milligrams of vitamin powder sprinkled on its food every day, while the other does not. He weighs the mice daily, giving them an edible treat if they cooperate during the handling and weighing. First, the strengths of this experimental design: The hypothesis is measurable and testable. The independent variable is clearly identied as the v itamin. The dependent variable is identied as the growth of the mice as measured by changes in weight. Now, some of the weaknesses: Are only two mice (one control, one experimen-tal) s ufcient to represent a larger population? The mice are identical, but there is no mention of a wa y to identify which mouse gets the vitamin and which does not. The mice are placed in the same cage, meaning that the y both have access to the food sprinkled with the vitamin. This may invalidate the data. Has the vitamin been approved for use in mice? C an the mice be harmed by ingesting the vitamin? Giving the mice an edible treat at unspecied int ervals introduces another independent variable. Practice Use the passage to answer the questions that follow. Paint DUraBiL itY exP eriM ent A paint company has developed a new brand of outdoor latex paint (Brand X) that it thinks might be more durable than another company's brand (Brand Y). To save money, the company paints boards of dif - ferent scrap wood with Brand X and Brand Y pai nts. Employees paint boards with the same number of coats of paint and measure the paint thickness of each board. They place matched boards painted with Brand X and Brand Y in different environments (des-ert, temperate forest, arctic tundra) for 12 mon ths. After 12 months, they measure the paint thickness of each board again. They find that the boards painted with Brand Y have thinner coats of paint than those painted with Brand X. They conclude that Brand X is more durable than Brand Y. 237237 n n n - - _____________________________________ _____________________________________ _____________________________________ SCIENCE PRACTICES 15.

Design a Scientific Investigation Planning and designing scientic investigations requires the ability to test a hypothesis that has been formed. As you've learned, the investigator needs to identify the important variables and determine how they might be observed, measured, and controlled. In fact, being able to control factors in the experiment is critical to the investigation. In many instances, espe-cially investigations that take place outside of the lab-oratory, there are often conditions that are outside the cont rol of the investigator. The investigator must also make decisions about what measurements will be taken and what instruments are best suited to making those measure-ments. Because precision is a key issue, it is important to meas ure the variable as accurately as possible. This will reduce sources of error in the experimental design. An important part of the investigation is the data that is produced. Selecting an appropriate for - mat in which to record data is also part of good expe rimental design. Now let's design an experiment. Here's the ques- tion: Does Fertilizer A help plants grow faster than Fertilizer B? First, identify what variables will be tested and what variables should be controlled. Fertilizers A and B should be applied to the same type of plant. This makes the type of plant one of your controls. Should all the plants be fertilized? No, there should be a control that has no fertil-izer for comparison to make sure that both typ es of fertilizer are working. For the plants that are being fertilized, the amount of fertilizer being applied should be the same. Should one plant get more sunlight or water or be exp osed to different temperatures than the other experimental plant? No. Water, temperature, and amount of light should also be co ntrols, as well as the length of the experiment (time). What will be the independent variable? The type of fertilizer What will be the dependent variable? The plant growth 238238 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES n n n n Now that these decisions have been made, writ- ing a set of procedures for the investigative design wil l allow you to follow the guidelines and carry out the experiment. The scientic investigative procedures might look so mething like this when you are nished: FertiLiZ erS anD GrOWt H exP eriM ent 1. Take 30 bean sprouts of equal height and weight, potted in identical containers with identical types and amounts of soil. Label the bean sprouts: Plant 1, Plant 2, Plant 3, . . . Plant 30. 2.

Measur e the height of each plant with a metric ruler daily at 5 P.M. 8. Record the measurements. reasoning from Data On the GED\u00ae Science test you will be expected to evaluate and verify various sources of data to form a hypothesis, come to a conclusion, or answer a question. You should be prepared to make sense of information from a variety of texts, data sets, and models. Applying scientic reasoning to this process will help you link evidence to claims and assess how data s upports conclusions. You may also be asked to use statistical data in mathematical ways to determine probabilities or statistical variance. For each of these expectations, you should be able to interpret tables, diagrams, charts, and other texts; to explain and predict causal relationships; and to arrive at conclusions. This lesson will help you review and practice these important skills. Use Evidence to Support a Finding or Conclusion On test day you may be asked to gather information to support a nding or conclusion. In these cases, you will be provided with a written source\u2014some sort of scientic literature or technical information. Now, what do you do with it? First, critically read the source to determine the ce ntral, or main, ideas. Look for any conclusions the author may have made based on evidence presented in the source. Compare and evaluate the sources of information to see if they support the nding or con-clusion with which you have been presented. What specically are you looking for? Here are some s uggestions: Look for valid and reliable claims that are veried w ith data. Examine the method or design of the investiga-t ion that produced the data. Remember that if the inv estigation that produced the data is flawed, then the data itself is flawed. Evaluate the reliability of the sources of informa- t ion. Reliable sources may include government instit utions, universities, and some non-prot institutions. When possible, combine information from a vari- e ty of sources to establish evidence and resolve any c onflicting information. 239239 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES Read the following excerpt. are Bi OFUe LS tHe anSWer? As the world searches for alternatives to petroleum, corn-based ethanol and other biofuels derived from organic material have been considered as the perfect answer to transportation fuel problems. In fact, a U.S. government energy bill mandates that over 30 billion gallons of biofuels a year be used by the year 2020. However, separate studies released by the Nature Conservancy and Ivy League institutions reveal that ethanol may not be the best answer in the fight against global warming. They say using biofuels could make things worse. Biofuel crops, such as corn and sugar cane, remove carbon from Earth's atmosphere while they are growing. When biofuels are burned, they emit fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels like coal or oil. This makes biofuels almost carbon-neutral. However, studies are showing that ethanol could be even more dangerous for the environment than fossil fuels. The Ivy League study noted that clearing previously untouched land to grow biofuel crops releases long-con-tained carbon into the atmosphere. While planting biofuel crops in already tilled land is all right, th e problem arises when farmers disturb new land to grow more sugar cane or corn. Additionally, food and feed crops are being displaced by biofuel crops. The Nature Conservancy warns that \"converting rainforests, peat lands, savannas, or grasslands to produce biofuels in Brazil, South-east Asia, and the United States creates a 'biofuel carbon debt' by releasing 17 to 420 times more ca rbon dioxide than the fossil fuels they replace.\" Other negative effects include the extreme amounts of water needed for irrigation, runoffs from pesticides and fertilizers, and the natural gas used to make the fertilizers that adds to the carbon deficit. Your task is to gather information that supports the conclusion that corn-based ethanol is not a sustain-able source of transportation fuel for the future. Let's look at information in the passage and address the points mentioned earlier. the quote from the Nature Conservancy does provide some supporting data for the answer: \"converting rainforests, peat lands, savannas, or grasslands to produce biofuels in Brazil, South-east Asia, and the United States creates a 'bio-fuel carbon debt' by releasing 17 to 420 times more carbon dioxide than the fossil fuels they replace.\" Are the claims in the article from reliable sources? The article mentions studies released by the Nature Conservancy and Ivy League institu-tions. These institutions generally count as reli-able and valid sources. Are there various sources to help establish evidence and resolve conflicting information? Yes, the article cites reports from the Nature Conservancy, Ivy League institutions, and a U.S. government energy bill. Are they veried with supporting data? This article excerpt does not include copies of the data from the studies it mentions. However, 240240 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES n n n n n Let's combine the evidence supporting the claims that ethanol is not a sustainable source of transportation fuel: Clearing previously untouched land to grow bio-fue l crops releases long-contained carbon into the atmosphere. Growing biofuel crops displaces food and feed crops. Biofuel crops need extreme amounts of water for irrigation. Treating elds of biofuel crops with pesticides and fertilizers creates pollution when these chem-icals run off into waterways. Making fertilizers for growing biofuel crops r equires natural gas, which adds to the carbon decit. Taken together, all of these points support the idea that g rowing biofuel crops for transportation is not sustainable and may be worse than burning the fossil fuels that they are intended to replace. Use Data to Arrive at a Conclusion Another important scientic practice skill is that of using data or evidence to arrive at a conclusion. To do this well on the GED\u00ae Science test, you need to syn-thesize information from the sources with which you are provided. The sources might include texts, experi- mental results, models, or data sets. Critically read the info rmation provided to you. You will need to inter - pret the tables, diagrams, charts, and any coordinat-ing information. Then, apply scientic reasoning to arr ive at a conclusion. Take a look at the following example. aVOiD inG VitaM in D DeFiC ienCY Approximately one billion people world - wide have vitamin D deficiency. This defi- ciency is thought to be largely due to in sufficient exposure to the sun. In some cases, poor diet can also play a role. There is increasing evidence that vitamin D defi-ciency also increases a person's susceptibil-ity to autoimmune conditions. Additionally, a l ack of vitamin D can impact bone development. The main source of vitamin D in the body comes from exposing the skin to sun- light. Just 10 minutes of exposure to ultra-violet B radiation wavelengths between 280 an d 315 nm, five days a week, will give most people enough vitamin D. However, extended exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun is known to increase the risk of skin cancer. Widespread campaigns for the use of sunscreen and sun avoidance have reduced the incidences of skin cancers. However, sunscreens with sun protection factors of 15 or higher also decrease the body's ability to synthesize vitamin D by 99%. 241241 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES raD iatiO n tYPe UVa UVB UVC linked to aging burning wavelength 400 nm to 315 nm 315 nm to 280 nm 280 nm to 100 nm % reaching Earth at noon 0.95 0.05 0%\u2014absorbed by ozone, molec- ular oxygen, and water vapor inthe upper atmosphere % reaching Earth before 10 a.m. 0.99 0.01 0 and after 2 p.m. % reaching Earth (average) 0.97 0.03 0 What are the consequences of vitamin D deciency?

UVB r adiation (315 to 289 nm) How much daily sunlight exposure is neces- sary to make vitamin D? 10 minutes From information in the passage, what are the appar ent contradictions regarding vitamin D deciency and sunlight exposure? While exposure to ultraviolet radiation is impo rtant for your body to make vitamin D, it also puts you at risk for cancer. So, how can we resolve this contradiction and come to a conclusion? Let's look at the infor - mation further. When does the amount of UV A reaching the Ear th peak? Before 10 A.M. and after 2 P.M. When does the amount of UVB reaching the Ear th peak? Noon Does wearing sunscreen reduce UV exposure? Yes, when the SPF value is greater than 15. Now, let's put all the information together to draw a co nclusion about how we can safely expose our skin to ultraviolet radiation to make vitamin D but mini-mally risk skin cancer: SYntHeSiZ inG VitaM in D SaFe LY A daily exposure of ten minutes of UVB sun - light therapy at noon has been shown to re duce risks of autoimmune disease and improve bone health. UVB peaks at noon, while UVA peaks before 10 A.M. and after 2 P.M. So, by going outside for 10 minutes around noon and wearing a sunscreen with an SPF factor less than 15, we can have beneficial sunlight therapy for vitamin D synthesis with a relatively low risk of skin cancer associated with exposure to ultravio-let radiation. 242242 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES 243243 Note that we used multiple pieces of scientic infor- mation in the passage and the data table to come to a conclusion regarding the risks and benets of expo- sure to sunlight for vitamin D therapy.

Moose were native to the island. Since the 1950s, ecologists have studied the moose and wolf populations on the island. The population data are shown in the graph.

Based on the information, what can you con-clude about the relationship between moose (pr ey) and wolves (predator) between a hypothesis\u2014a testable prediction\u2014 inv olves asking questions about data and claims that are made. You can ask a question about data that will lead you to analyze more evidence and make inter - pretations about that evidence. On the GED\u00ae Science test, you may be asked to make a prediction based on a given data set or textual evidence. As always, reading and analyzing the information critically and carefully are key. Use Sampling Techniques to Answer Scientific Questions Scientic questions involving sampling techniques often use statistics and probability to explain con-cepts such as variation and distribution in popula-tions. To be well prepared to answer questions using this scie nce practice, you should become familiar with the following types of statistical and probability concepts: Mean (X)\u2014the average, computed as the sum of all the o bserved outcomes from the sample divided by the total number of events. Mode\u2014the n umber of a set of data with the highest frequency (i.e., that occurs more often than any of the other numbers in the set). Median\u2014the middle value or score. If you have an e ven number of values in a set, take the aver - age of the two middle values. The median is bet-ter for describing the typical value and is often used f or income or home prices. Variance (X2)\u2014a measure of how far the data is spread apart. Standard deviation (X)\u2014the square root of the v ariance, which can be thought of as measuring how far the data values lie from the mean. Probability\u2014the likelihood of one or more e vents happening divided by the number of pos- sible outcomes. If you have ever used percentages, fra ctions, or ratios to describe or predict the like- lihood of an outcome, you have measured pr obability. Here's how you'd nd the mean, median, and mode fo r a list of values: 12, 17, 12, 13, 12, 15, 13, 20, 12 Mean To nd the mean, take the values, add them up, and div ide by how many values you have. 1. Add the values. The sum is 126 (12 + 17 + 12 + 13 + 12 + 15 + 13 + 20 + 12 = 126). 2. Count up how many items or values you have add ed: 9. 3. Divide the sum of the values (126) by the num-ber of values (9), and you get 14 (126 \u00f7 9 = 14). The mean, or average, is 14. 244244 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES Median To nd the median, reorder the values from lowest to highest. The median will be the number in the mid- dle. If you have an even number of values, the median wil l be the average of the two numbers in the middle. 1. First, put the values in order from smallest to largest: 12, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 15, 17, 20. 2. Then, nd the number in the middle of this list. T here are nine numbers in the list, so the middle one will be the fth number: 12, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 15, 17, 20. The median is 13. Mode The mode refers to the value that occurs most fre-quently in the list. If you have a list of three numbers and o ne occurs twice, that will be the mode. In longer lists, it will again help to put the values in order. From then on, it's simple! Just look for the number that occurs most often: 1. Put in order from smallest to largest: 12, 12, 12, 12, 13, 13, 15, 17, 20. 2. Look for the number that occurs most often: 12, 12 , 12, 12, 13, 13, 15, 17, 20. T here are four 12s, more than any other number. The mod e is 12. Here's another example. A r estaurant owner wants to know how much custo mers spend at the establishment. She randomly selects 10 receipts from groups of four dine rs and records the following data: 44, 50, 38, 96, 42, 47, 40, 39, 46, 50 What is the average amount of money that a group of four spends at the restaurant? You learned previously that to calculate the mean, add all the numbers and divide by the number of values, in this case 10. The mean (or average) of the values is 49.2 or $49.20. To get the variance and standard deviation of this data, y ou must perform the following steps: 1. First, nd the mean of your given values. This ste p is complete\u201449.2. Now that you know this number, set up a table that subtracts the mean from each observed value. Value - Mean = 44 - 49.2 -5.2 50 - 49.2 0.8 38 - 49.2 -11.2 96 - 49.2 46.8 42 - x= 288.8 or 289 rounded n n - - SCIENCE PRACTICES 2. Square each of the differences, and then add up all those values. Value - Mean = 2x = 44 - 49.2 -5.2 0.64 Total: 2,599.60 3. Divide by n - 1, where n is the number of items in the sample (10). This is the variance. X2,599.60 2 = ________ x n - 1 X2,599.60 2 = ________ x 10 - 1 X2,599.60 2 = ________ x 9 4. To get the standard deviation, take the square root of the variance: \u0003 \u0003X = 289 x \u0003 \u0003X x= 17 The standard deviation can be thought of as measur - ing how far the data values lie from the mean, so take the mean and move one standard deviation in either direction. The mean of the values was 49.2 and the stan- dard deviation is 17. 49.2 - 17 = 32.2 49.2 + 17 = 66.2 T herefore, most groups of four customers spend be tween $32.20 and $66.20. Now, let's look at an example of probability: T he seven days of the week are written on scraps o f paper and placed into a hat. What is the probability of picking a weekend day out of the hat? The event is choosing a day that falls on the weekend. This is w hat you want to answer: 1. The number of outcomes is the total number of days in a week, 7. 2. T here are 2 weekend days. 3. 2 \u00f7 7 = 0.2857 Practice U se a calculator for the following questions, if needed.

Whether you are using data to form a hypothesis or a co nclusion, or to support ndings or probabilities, critically reading and analyzing the information is important. Take the time to identify the main idea and logically interpret the data. Do not be intimi-dated by large sets of data or wordy texts. Look for co ordinating information. Then, evaluate how that information supports your task and use it to answer the necessary questions. evaluating Conclusions and e vidence On the GED\u00ae Science test, as in life, you will have to evaluate theories, conclusions, and claims. For example, as you are viewing some page on the Internet, an advertisement might pop up and make a claim such as this: \"Revolutionary new fruit lets you shed pounds!\" Accompanying the claim, there may be a testimonial from some man or woman who claims to have lost 40 pounds while eating this fruit; before-and-after photos are often included. There may even be an endorsement by some celeb - rity as to the fruit's effectiveness for losing weight. Th e advertisement might link to another web page for you to buy the fruit or some extract from it. So, you must then draw some conclusion or make a judgment based on the information presented. Is there enough information? Is the information scientically valid? Is it worth spending money on the p r oduct? Is it safe? Evaluating scientic ndings, drawing conclu- sions, and making judgments are what scientists do. The y evaluate experiments, analyze scientic data (data obtained by themselves and others), draw con-clusions, and make judgments. The conclusions and judg ments help them accept or reject hypotheses and modify theories. In this section, we examine and practice such skills. Making Judgments about Whether Theories or Conclusions are Supported or Challenged by Data or Evidence In any scientic experiment, the hypothesis makes some sort of testable prediction. The investigator designs an experiment to test the hypothesis and gathers data. The investigator must then examine the data to determine whether the data supports or refutes the prediction made by the hypothesis. The data must be scrutinized thoroughly with a skeptical eye. As you learned previously, critical questions must be asked about the methods used in the inves - tigation. For example, was the experimental design ad equate to test the hypothesis? Were the technolo - gies used appropriate? Were all the variables identi - ed and properly controlled, except for the inde pendent and dependent variables? Was the con- trol group appropriate? Were there enough samples take n? Once such questions have been answered sat- isfactorily, then we have condence about the data ob tained and whether it can support or refute the hypothesis. Let's look at an example. 247247 Effects of Fertilizer Tr eatment on 0.0 0 5 10 15 20 Time (weeks) Contro l Brand Y Brand X Other variables were the temperature of the greenhouse as well as the amounts of soil, water, and sunlight. All of these variables were controlled. - - SCIENCE PRACTICES BranD x VerSUS BranD Y FertiLiZ er exP eriM ent A company claims that its new fertilizer, Brand X, will make plants, such as tomato plants, grow faster and produce more fruit than a leading brand by another company, Brand Y. The directions for each fertilizer indicate that they are used at the same concentration (50 g/kg soil). A scientist uses 150 tomato plant seedlings. He divides the seedlings into three groups of 50 plants. Each seedling is 10 to 12 cm high at the start of the study and is planted in a pot containing 1 kg of potting soil; the soil is identical for all groups. To one group (control), nothing is added to the soil. To a second group, 50 g of Brand Y is added to the soil of each plant. To a third group, 50 g of Brand X is added to the soil. All of the plants are grouped together in the same greenhouse at a constant temperature of 25\u00b0C. The light in the greenhouse is uniformly illuminated and all plants are exposed to a 12-hour on/off cycle. The plants are carefully watered each day with 200 mL of water each. The height of each plant is measured and recorded weekly for 20 weeks. In addition, the number of tomatoes produced by each plant is noted at the end of the experiment (week 20). Before we examine the data, review the experimental design: What was the hypothesis? If tomato plants are treated with Brand X, then they should g row faster and produce more tomatoes than those treated with Brand Y or untreated. What was the independent variable? The amount of time that growth was measured (we eks). What was/were the dependent variable(s)? Was the number of samples adequate? Yes, 50 samples in each group were adequate. Overall, was the experimental design appro- priate to test the hypothesis? Yes, the experimental design was adequate and app ropriate. Look at the data obtained from the experiment. The av erage height of the plants in each group is shown in the graph. The average height of the tomato plants and the number of tomatoes produced per plant. What were the other variables, and were they controlled? 248248 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES _____________________________________ _____________________________________ _____________________________________ Here are some questions to consider when looking at the graph: Practice What was the maximum height of tomato plants in each group? T he maximum height was 90 cm in each group. How long did it take each group to reach the maximum height? T he control plants took 15 weeks to reach the maximum he ight, while plants treated with Brand Y and Brand X took 10 weeks and 6 weeks, respectively. Which plants grew the fastest? Brand X grew fastest (about 13.3 cm/week). Br and Y grew the next fastest (about 8 cm/ week). The control plants grew the slowest (about 5.3 cm/week). Consider the hypothesis. Did the growth res ults support the prediction made in the hypothesis? Yes, as predicted, the plants treated with Brand X fe rtilizer grew faster than the control plants and the Brand Y-treated plants. Now, look at the number of tomatoes produced by the plants, as sho wn in the table. eFFeC t OF F ertiLiZ er O n tOMat O PLant Pr ODUCtiOn aVeraG e nUMBer OF tOMat OeS Per PLant treatM ent Control 3.5 Brand Y 7.2 Brand X 6.1 Use this data to answer the following questions. 23. Did treating the plants with fertilizers increase the fruit p roduction? a. Yes b. No 24. Consider the hypothesis. Did the plants treated with B rand X produce more tomatoes than those treated with Brand Y? a. Yes b. No 25. Now that you have all this data, what would you c onclude about the company's claims regarding Brand X? Remember that the com-pany claimed Brand X would cause plants to gr ow faster and produce more fruit. In this example, we were able to use data to evaluate a claim (hypothesis or theory) by examining the exper - imental procedure and then the data obtained from that e xperiment. Once we were convinced that the experiment was sound, we were condent that the data could be used. In this case, there were multiple ndings; the data supported one claim (faster growth) but challenged another (increased tomato production). Often, the details of the experimental design and p rocedures may not be available, so you must look at the data only. Always keep in mind what pre-dictions are made by the hypothesis, claim, or theory. Do es the data address those predictions? What can you conclude from the data? How does the data relate to the predictions? Does the data support the hypoth-esis? Does the data refute the hypothesis? If the data re futes the hypothesis, then how should the hypothe- sis be modied? 249249 SCIENCE PRACTICES 250250 - - eFFeCt S OF teMPeratU re anD PreSSUre Bring Together and Make Sense of Multiple Findings, Conclusions, or Theories On the GED\u00ae Science test you will be asked to examine multiple pieces of information to come to conclusions and make judgments. Consider the following example. The Haber process is a chemical reaction where nitrogen and hydrogen gases are combined to form ammonia gas. The reaction is represented by this chemical equation: N2 (g) + 3 H2 (g) exothermic 2 NH3 (g) endothermic Chemists studied the effects of increasing pressure on the gases in the reaction. The same amounts of nitrogen and hydrogen gases were combined in a fixed chamber. They increased the pressure of the chamber from 0 to 400 atmospheres. They repeated the experiment at several fixed temperatures from 350\u00b0C to 550\u00b0C. In each case, they measured the percent yield of ammo- nia produced in the reaction. The data are shown in the graph: 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 0 100 200 300 400 Pressure (atm) Ammonia Produced (%)350\u00baC 400\u00baC 450\u00baC 500\u00baC 550\u00baC - - SCIENCE PRACTICES n n n n n n n n n n As you can see, the results contain more than one piece of information. Don't get confused by the mul-tiple lines. Let's look at each individually: How does the percent yield of ammonia change with increasing pressure at 350\u00b0C? How does the percent yield of ammonia change with increasing pressure at 400\u00b0C? How does the percent yield of ammonia change with increasing pressure at 450\u00b0C? How does the percent yield of ammonia change with increasing pressure at 500\u00b0C? How does the percent yield of ammonia change with increasing pressure at 550\u00b0C? r eaction at a xed pressure, you will decrease the pro- duction of ammonia. From a practical industrial standpoint, there are costs associated with building an apparatus that can increase pressures and temperatures. The changes in costs of increasing pressure and temperature are shown in the graphs: Cost Incr eases Associated with Increasing Pr essur e 1,000 The answer to all these questions is\u2014it increases. So, generally, if you increase the pressure of the reaction at a xed temperature, you will increase the produc- tion of ammonia.

How does the percent yield of ammonia change with increasing temperature at a pressure of 100 atm? How does the percent yield of ammonia change with increasing temperature at a pressure of 200 atm?

Practice 26. Suppose that you are a chemical engineer and must mak e a facility that will produce large amounts of ammonia using the Haber process. The best conditions to produce the greatest percent yield of ammonia would be: __________ atm at _________\u00b0C. 27. Which is the highest pressure that the reaction can be r un at without signicantly increasing the costs (signicant increase is dened as greater than 25%)? a. 100 atm b. 200 atm c. 300 atm d. 400 atm 28.

In some cases, you may have the experimental designs available to you. If so, look at the experimental design and ask these questions: What was the hypothesis? What was the independent variable? What was/were the dependent variable(s)? What were the other variables, and were they controlled? Were the measurement methods appropriate to what was being measured? Was the number of samples adequate? Overall, was the experimental design appropriate to test the hypothesis? I f you are satised with the answers to these ques- tions, then you can be condent that the data is app ropriate to address the hypothesis. You can then draw conclusions from the data. In doing so, you may look at the patterns in the data. Once you have drawn conclusions, you can then ask, \"Do the conclusions from the data support or refute the hypothesis?\" In many cases, you may not have details of the exp erimental design available. So, you need to assess whether the data are appropriate to evaluate the hypothesis. For example, a hypothesis dealing with growth of an organism might be appropriately assessed with height or weight data, but not tempera-ture measurements. In some instances, you may have multiple pieces of information available and must integrate them into conclusions, judgments, or theories. For exam-ple, what is the most cost-effective way to produce ammonia? expressing Scientific i nformation When carrying out experiments, scientists gather data. The data can be qualitative data. For example, the color of the solution changes from clear to dark purple as the chemical reaction proceeds. Most often, the data is quantitative data\u2014the data are numbers. The numbers may be described verbally, as in a sen-tence. Numerical data is most often expressed in gr aphs, tables, or other charts, where it can easily be analyzed for patterns. This section examines various ways of expressing scientic data. 252252 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES Express Scientific Information or Findings Visually Numerical data can be either categorical data or con- tinuous data. Cat egorical data has the numbers bro- ken up into groups or categories. Co ntinuous data has numbers expressed on a continuous number line. Both categorical and continuous data can be expressed visually in tables, charts, or graphs. Let's look at some examples. Another way to express categorical data is by using a pie c hart. Here, the number of each category is con- verted to a percentage. Each category is represented by a \"slice\" that corresponds to that category's per - centage of the whole. Here, you can more easily see that more respon- dents had a favorable opinion (Liked very much and Lik ed): Consumer Opinion of Cereal Brand X 4. Liked very much 1. Did not like at all 2. Did not like or dislike 3. Liked ratinG a CereaL A survey asks 100 respondents to rate how well they like a particular brand of cereal on a scale of 1 to 4. The number 1 represented \"Did not like at all,\" 2 represented \"Did not like or dislike,\" 3 represented \"Liked,\" and 4 represented \"Liked very much.\" The responses were 10, 25, 30, and 35 for responses 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. You see that the responses are grouped into distinct categories (1, 2, 3, or 4), so this is categorical data. One way to express this data visually is to organize it into a table. The first column contains the categories of responses. This column is usually the inde - pendent variable. In contrast, the second column contains the total number of respon- dents in each category, which is the depen-dent variable. The table would look like this: COn SUMer OP iniO n OF CereaL BranD x r eSPOn Se nUMBer 1. Did not like at all 10 2. Did not like or dislike 25 3. Liked 30 4. Liked very much 35 A third way to visualize this data is by using a bar graph. In this type of graph, the categories are plot - ted on the x-axis, while the number of respondents in each category is plotted on the y-axis. The bar graph of this data looks like this: Consumer Opinion of Cer eal Brand X 40tsen35 nd30 spo25 Re20 15Number of10 5 0 1. Did not like 2. Did not like 3. Liked 4.

In the experi-ment, he is trying to answer the question \"How does the v elocity of a ball rolling down a ramp change with time?\" Distances along the ramp are marked at 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 m. He rolls a ball down the ramp. He starts a stopwatch when he releases the ball at the top of the ramp and stops it when the ball passes the rst mark. He repeats this four times and records the aver - age time. He repeats the experiment again, but this time he stops the watch at the second mark and records the time. He continues with the procedure until he records the average time to the last mark. He then calculates the velocities. The data are shown in the table. DiStanCe (M) tiMe (S) VeLOCitY M ( /S) 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 00.20 0.28 0.35 0.40 0.45 0 0.50 0.70 0.88 1.00 1.13 To visualize how the velocity changes, Jamie decides to make a graph. The variables are time and velocity. First, he must determine the dependent and indepen-dent variables. Which is the independent variable? T ime is the independent variable. Ask yourself: Is time changed by the velocity of the ball? No. Therefore, time must be the independent variable. Which is the dependent variable? I f the velocity of the ball does not change time, then time may change the velocity of the ball. Therefore, the veloc-ity of the ball is the dependent variable. In a graph, the independent variable gets plotted on the ho rizontal axis, or x-axis. The dependent variable gets plotted on the vertical axis or y-axis. In this example, time gets plotted on the x-axis and velocity gets plotted on the y-axis. We choose a scale on each axis that will include all the values and is divided evenly. The x-axis and the y-axis do not need to have the same values. 1.20 1.00 0.80 0.60 0.40 0.20 0.00 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 Time(s) Velocity (m/s) This graph is an example of a linear line graph; it is perhaps the most common type of line graph that you will see. Other types of line graphs may be non- linear. For example, if Jamie plotted the distance ver - sus time, he would get a graph like this: 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 Time(s) Distance (m) This is an example of a non-linear line graph. Note that the distance that the ball rolls down the ramp increases with time, but not at a constant rate. 254254 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES _____________ ____________ Express Scientific Information or Findings Using Numbers or Symbols Scientic data can be quantitative (expressed with numbers) or qualitative (expressed verbally or with symbols). Such data may be organized into a table. Let's look at an example. Cindy is conducting an experiment on human hearing and musical notes. She blindfolds a subject and plays a reference note like middle C (C 4). Next, she plays another note and asks the subject whether the note was higher or lower relative to the reference note. She indicates a higher pitch with one or more \"+\" signs and a lower note with one or more \"-\" signs. She organizes her subject's responses in a table like this: MUSiCaL nO te reLatiV e P itCH G3 - - A3 - Middle C (C4) 0 D4 + E4 + + Note that the quantitative data still shows the notes in the same order from lowest to highest as the qualita-tive data does. However, Cindy can now answer the quest ion that an E4 musical note is 134 Hz higher than a G3 musical note. Practice Jill is watching the development of red color in a solution with time during a chemical reaction. She notes the time and rates the color on a scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being light red (almost pink) and 10 being dark red (almost purple). She expresses her data in a table: tiMe (MinUteS) reL atiVe reD COLOr 1 1 2 3 3 5 4 6 5 6 Suppose that Cindy had a microphone hooked up to an oscilloscope where she could measure the fre-quency of each musical note.

After 1 minute, what color is the solution? 30. What color does the solution nally develop? Express Scientific Information or Findings in Words When publishing scientic papers or reports, space may be limited. Producing graphs or tables may be expensive. Therefore, some data may need to be sum-marized verbally. In addition, some information may be noteworthy but not important enough to justify its own table, graph, or chart. Consider this example: 255255 - - 256SCIENCE PRACTICES 256 A student drops a ball from a tall building, while another student videotapes the ball's path. They repeat the experiment 10 times. From the videotape, they measure the dis- tance and calculate the velocities and accel-erations with time. They average the values and plot them on graphs: 150 100 50 0 0 2 4 6 Time(s) Distance (m) 50 40 30 20 10 0 0 2 4 6 Time(s) Velocity (m/s) 15 10 5 0 0 2 4 6 Time(s) Acceleration (m/s/s) DrOPPe D Ba LL exPeriM ent How could we simplify the description of these results? First, look at the graph of acceleration. Note that acceleration does not change; it is constant at 10 m/s/s. So, one way to simplify the presentation might be to eliminate that graph and verbally state the result: 50 40 30 20 10 0 0 2 4 6 Time(s) Velocity (m/s) Acceleration of the ball was constant at 10 m/s/s. How might the students simplify the presentation of the results even further? The velocity graph could also be described ver- bally. For example, the velocity of the ball increased linearly from zero at a constant rate of 10 m/s. ( Note: The rate of a linear graph is the slope of the line.) Pick any two points on the line and use the slope for- mula. For example, use (4,40) and (0,0).

How would you simplify this presentation? _____________________________________ _____________________________________ Scientific theories and Probabilities and Statistics We've learned that scientists and others must often present information and data, and that the informa- tion may be qualitative data or quantitative data. Most often, qualitative data may be expressed verbally or in tables using symbols or numbers. Quantitative data is best presented visually so that one can see the patterns in the data to draw conclusions. T o understand the world around us, scientists carry out experiments, gather data, draw conclusions, and form theories and models. The theories and mod- els lead to new predictions that can be tested by experi - ments. Thus, the cycle continues as new discoveries are made and old ideas are either discarded or modied into new ones that better explain natural phenomena. One important aspect of analyzing experimen- tal data, especially quantitative data, is determining whether a nding is signicant or due to some ran-dom error. Often, scientists describe sets of data sta- tistically and perform statistical (i.e., mathematical) tests on the data to determine its signicance. Let's examine various ways of examining data statistically in the context of scientic investigations. Understand and Apply Scientific Models, Theories, and Processes Theories and models are ways that scientists formu-late and express ideas to explain the world around them. Models and theories not only explain but also make predictions that can be tested with experiments. Models may be physical or mathematical. 9 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES The most common mathematical model that you will encounter will be the equation of a straight line relating a y-variable to an x-variable. This equation often has the general form of y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept (the y-coordinate of a point where the line crosses the y-axis). Here's an example of a linear model: Linear exaMPLe Starting 2.0 m away from you, a man walks in a straight line farther from you at a constant velocity. His position with time is shown in the table and the graph. What was the man's velocity? Time (s) Position (m) 20.00 15.00 Position (m)10.00 5.00 0.00 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Time(s)0 2.00 1 3.50 2 5.00 3 6.50 4 8.00 5 9.50 6 11.00 7 12.50 8 14.00 15.50 10 17.00 By definition, velocity is the rate of change of position with time or the slope of the straight line on a position-time graph. It's a straight line because the man is walking at constant velocity. So, to find the equation of the line, we must first calculate the slope of the line: 1. Pick any two points on the line. We'll use (2,5) and (4,8). 2. Use the slope 2 - y1)m = (x2 - y1) m__________ (8 m - 5 m) = (4 s - 2 s) m_____ (3 m) = (2 s) m m = 1.5__ s So, the man's velocity is 1.5 m/s. 3. Now, let's find the y -intercept. At time zero, the man started from 2 m away. Therefore, the y-intercept is 2 m. You can see this on the graph as well. It's the point where the line crosses the y-axis (vertical axis). 4. So, the equation of the line in the form y = mx + bbecomes: y= 1.5 x + 2. 258258 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES Here are some examples of other mathematical mod- els that you may encounter in science. Don't worry about the math, but just pay attention to the shapes of the curves. Power Function y = axn where a is a coefcient, x is the base, and n is a whole number exponent. For example, if you had a penny and each day it was doubled, how much would you have on the 30th day? Here are the equation and graph: 2.00 1.50 1.00 0.50 0.00 0 20 40 60 Days Phosphorous-32 (g)y = 2e-0.049x y = axn, where a = 0.01, x = 2, n = 30 y = (0.01)(230) y = (0.01)(1,073,741,824) y = 10,737,418.24 12,000 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000 0 0 5 10 15 20 Days Dollars Exponential growth curves have the same shape but increase instead of decrease. Here's one for a popula - tion that starts with 10 organisms and grows exp onentially. 200 150 100 50 0 0 20 40 60 Days Populationy = 10e0.0486x Exponential Function y = cex, where c is a constant, e is the base of a natural logarithm, and x is a whole number exponent. Often population growth and decay of radioactive sub- stances follow these functions. For example, radioac- tive phosphorus-32 has a half-life of 14.26 days. Here is the graph of the decay of 2 g of radioactive phos- phorus-32 over time (don't worry about the math; just recognize the shape of the graph). Sigmoidal Curve Often called an S-curve, this function describes the growth of populations where there is a limit to growth or carrying capacity of the environment. (Again, don't worry about the math; just recognize the shape of the curve.) In a population growth curve like this, there is a rapid phase of growth (almost 259259 1.0 0.8 Height (m)0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 Distance (m) 1.5 1,000 800 Population600 400 200 0 0 10 20 30 Days Given: Fnet = 10 N, m = 2 kg a = 5 m/s2 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES exponential) followed by a slowing phase until the population stabilizes at its limit (carrying capacity). In this graph, the population started at 10 organisms and grew to a limit of 1,000. Apply Formulas from Scientific Theories Equations in science are a guide to thinking. They show how variables relate to each other. For example, Newton's second law of motion relates the net force on an object (Fnet), the mass of the object (m), and the object's acceleration (a). Parabolic Function Fa = ___ net m The law combines two ideas in one equation. First, the greater the force on an object, the greater the acceleration of the object (i.e., acceleration is propor - tional to the net force). Second, when given the same net force applied to objects, the greater the mass, the slower the acceleration (i.e., acceleration is inversely proportional to mass). So, let's look at how this for - mula might be addressed in a problem: John slides a box horizontally across a friction- less surface with a net force of 10 newtons (10 N). The box has a mass of 2 kg. What is the acceleration of the box? Here's how to solve the problem in a series of steps: This type of curve has the form y = ax2 + bx + c. This equation describes the path of a projectile, like a foot- ball kicked at an angle. Here is the graph of a ball thrown with a velocity of 4.47 m/s at an angle of 66\u00b0. 1. R ead the problem. What d o you know? What are you trying to nd? Write the information down. Unknown: a = ? 2. What equation do you need to nd the unknow n information? F a = ___ net m 3. Is the equation in the form that you need to solv e for the unknown? If not, rearrange the equation algebraically to nd the unknown. In this case, the equation is in the correct form to solve for a. 4. Substitute the known values into the equation and solv e for the unknown: F a = ___ net m 10 N a = ____ 2 kg 260260 - - SCIENCE PRACTICES 5. Check your answer. Does it make sense? Are the units correct? In this case, yes, m/s2 is the unit of acceleration. Use Counting Techniques to Solve Scientific Problems There are certain types of scientic investigations where the scientist must determine all possible out-comes of some event. Let's look at an example. KinDS OF Da CHSHUn DS A breeder of dachshunds knows that the dog comes in three coats (long-haired, short-haired, wire-haired), three possible colors (red, brown, black), and two patterns (solid, dappled). Hhow many kinds of dachs - hunds could there be? To solve this, we will use the fundamental rule of counting, which states: In a sequence of n events, in which the rst one has k1 possibilities, the second one has k2 possi- bilities, on to the nth one, which has k npossi- bilities, the total coat (k1) = 3, color (k2) = 3, and pattern (k3) = 2. Therefore, by the fundamental rule of counting, the total number of outcomes = 3 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 2 = 18. Practice CODOnS Inside each cell of your body, ribonucleic acid (RNA) contains information to build proteins. A molecule of ribonucleic acid has four nitrogen bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). A sequence of three nitrogen bases makes up a codon, which is a unit that codes for one amino acid. 33. How many distinct codons can be made from the nitro gen bases of RNA? ________ Now, suppose a molecular biologist wants to make an articial RNA codon of three nitrogen bases without repeating any single base. How many possibilities are there? In this type of problem, the scientist is using a permutation. A permutation is an ordered arrange- ment of r objects, which are chosen from n different ob jects, and the order is important. So, let's look at it this way: Four possible Only three possible Only two possible nitrogen bases nitrogen bases nitrogen bases can go here. remain to go here. remain to go here. The number of possible permutations is 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 = 24. Permutations are denoted in this manner: nP r. So, for this example, the permutation can be denoted as 4P3. 261261 - - ____________________________ ____________________________ _______________________ SCIENCE PRACTICES We can calculate any permutation according to this n! formula: nP = ______ r (n - 4)! , where n! means n factorial, which is n! = n \u00b7 (n - 1) \u00b7 (n - 2) \u00b7 (n - 3) . . . 1. (Many calculators with statistical functions have factorial keys on them.) Now let's see how we use the formula for our scientist's example from the previous practice: nP______ n! r = (n - r)! 4P______ 4! 3 = (4 - 3)! 4P__________ 4 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 2 \u00b7 1 ___ 24 3 = 1! = 1= 24 There are 24 possible permutations of nitrogen bases. Determine the Probability of Events Sometimes in science, we must make predictions on the outcomes of events. These predictions are called probabilities. The probability of an event is the likeli- hood that that event will occur. Probability is a num-ber between 0 and 1. It can be expressed as a fraction, de cimal, or percent. For example, a school organiza- tion sells 100 raffle tickets for a prize. Only one ticket wil l get drawn to win the prize (outcome A). So, the theoretical probability of the event happening is rep-resented by P(A), which can be calculated as follows: number of outcomes of AP(A) = total number of possible outcomes If you buy one ticket, what is the probability that you have the winning ticket? number of outcomes of AP(A) = total number of possible outcomes P___ 1(A) = 100 = 0.01 = 1% T he probability of having the winning ticket is 1%. Sometimes, it is not possible to measure all the possib le outcomes. So, you must nd the experimen- tal probability. To do so, you must conduct multiple tr ials and measure the number of trials where the outcome A occurs. P(A) = number of trials of A occurs total number of trials When tall pea plants are mated or crossed, there is a chance that some of the offspring will be short. A sci-entist conducts 100 crosses. Of these 100 crosses, six pr oduce short pea plants. What is the experimental probability of producing a short pea plant in any one cross? P(A) = n_______________________ umber of trials of A occurs total number of trials P___ 6(A) = 100 = 0.06 = 6% I f the height of the pea plant and whether it produces round or wrinkled seeds are independent events, then what will the probability be of producing a plant that is short and has wrinkled seeds? For independent events (A, B), the probability of both of them occur - ring [P(A and B)] is the product of the probabilities of each individual event: P(A and B) = P(A) \u00b7 P(B). So, we can calculate the probability of producing an offspring that is short and will produce wrinkled seeds: P(A and B) = P(A) \u00b7 P( B) P(A and B) = 0.06 \u00b7 0.025 P(A and B) = 0.0015 \u00b7 0.15% Practice 34. An agricultural scientist conducts 800 trials in crossing p ea plants that produce seeds with round seed coats. In these trials, 20 produce seeds with wrinkled seed coats. What is the probability of producing a plant that will yield wrinkled seeds? _________________ Summary This chapter has given you a solid foundation of how to approach scientic information with an analytic and critical eye.

Science Practices r eview Use the following information to answer question 1. reDUCinG OBeS itY in CHi LDren Today, about 30% of the children in the United States are overweight or obese. This puts them at increased risk for diseases such as diabetes (measured by fasting glucose levels) and heart disease (due to high choles - terol levels). The local county health depart-ment wants to improve the health of the you ng children in the community. Most research indicates that changing diet and exercise is the best way to reduce obesity in children, but the health department suspects that children may not be willing to change both diet and exercise. The county health department under - takes a new program to encourage children to e at better and exercise. They enroll 200 children in a six-month program and plan to set up three groups: n Group 1: diet and exercise n Group 2: diet only n Group 3: exercise only The county health department hypothesizes tha t the children in the diet and exercise group will have the best outcomes. 1.

Answers will vary: The county health department should ran-domly assign the 200 children to one of three e xperimental groups, as well as a control group, as follows: n Group 1: diet and exercise (50 children) n Group 2: diet only (50 children) n Group 3: exercise only (50 children) n Control group: no change in daily routine (50 children) T he health department employees would have to take measurements on all of the children before the intervention begins, at two months, and at six months to measure the change over time. They would take height, weight, choles- terol level, and fasting blood glucose level. They w ould also need to ask questions about the diet of the children and the amount of exercise they do on a daily basis. The children in Group 1 (diet and exercise) would be on a diet lower in fat and sugar (weekly menus provided by the health depart- ment) and would be asked to double the amount o f exercise they do in a week (e.g., if they normally exercise 20 minutes per week, then they will be asked to exercise 40 minutes per week). Parents would be asked to keep a food log and record the exercise on a daily basis. The children in Group 2 (diet change only) would be on the same reduced-fat and lower-sugar diet as the children in Group 1 but would not change their exercise routines. Parents would be asked to keep a food log and record the exercise on a daily basis. The children in Group 3 (exercise change only) w ould not be asked to change their diets, but would be asked to double the amount of exer - cise they do on a weekly basis, as in Group 1. P arents would be asked to keep a food log and record the exercise on a daily basis. The children in the control group would not be asked to change anything, but parents would be asked to keep a food log and record the exercise on a daily basis. After the conclusion of the experiment, the health department can compare the weights, cholesterol levels, and fasting blood glucose lev- els of each group and draw conclusions about the e ffectiveness of the interventions. 2. d.

Remem - ber, the focus of the exam isn't to assess your science content knowledge; it's to test your science reason - ing skills. On the test, you will never encounter a question that asks you to provide your own denition o f a specic science term or concept. However, according to the GED\u00ae Testing Service, you should be \"broadly and generally familiar\" with each of the basic science concepts covered in the next three chapters. In other words, to do your best, you should strive to generally understand and recognize all the concepts and terms you'll encoun - ter. Answers and explanations for all practice questions are at the end of this chapter. What Is Life Science? Life science explores the nature of living things, from the smallest building blocks of life to the larger principles that unify all living beings. Fundamental questions of life science include: What constitutes life? What are its building blocks and requirements? 271 n n n n 272272 1 Animal Cell Golgi Chloroplast Cell W all Vacuole 2 Plant Cell - - LIFE SCIENCE How are the characteristics of life passed on from generation to generation? How did life and different forms of life evolve? How do organisms depend on their environment and on one another? What kinds of behavior are common to living organisms? B efore Antoni van Leeuwenhoek looked through his home made microscope more than 300 years ago, people were not aware that there were cells in our bodies and that microorganisms existed. People even believed that fleas, ants, and other insects came from dust or wheat. Leeuwenhoek looked through his microscope and saw blood cells in blood, studied microorganisms in ponds, and showed that pests come from eggs laid by adult pests. It took more than 200 years for Leeuwenhoek's observations to gain wide acceptance and nd application in medicine, and yet the questions he asked have led us to learn all that we know now about life science. Life science questions on the GED\u00ae Science test wil l cover many topics studied in high school biology classes. Reviewing some of the basics of biology will help you to understand passages and nd the answers to questions on the GED\u00ae Science test. cell Theory Let's start with the cell, which we know today is the building block of life. Every living organism is com-posed of one or more cells, and all cells come from other cells. Cells are alive\u2014if blood cells, for example, are removed from the body, given the right condi-tions, they can continue to live independently of the body . Cells are made up of organized parts, perform che mical reactions, obtain energy from their sur - roundings, respond to their environments, change ov er time, reproduce, and share an evolutionary his-tory. All cells contain a membrane, cytoplasm, and ge netic material. More complex cells also contain cell organelles. The following is a description of cell compo- nents and some of the functions they serve, as well as a gure sho wing the parts of animal and plant cells. Cell Membranes The cell, or plasma, membrane is the outer mem- brane of the cell. It carefully regulates the transport of mate rials in and out of the cell and denes the cell's boundaries. Membranes have selective permeabil-ity\u2014meaning that they allow the passage of certain molecules, but not others. A membrane is like a bor - der crossing. Molecules need the molecular equiva-lent of a valid passport and a visa to get through. The movement of water and other types of mol- ecules across membranes (including cell membranes) is imp ortant to many life functions in living organ-- - LIFE SCIENCE n n n n n n n n n n isms. Movement of these molecules occurs by diffu- sion through semipermeable membranes, which means that the membranes allow small molecules, like water, to pass but block larger molecules, like sugar or glucose. The processes of diffusion and osmosis are sometimes called passive transport since they do not require any active role for the membrane. The molecules move across the membrane because of osmotic pressure. Osmotic pressure forces highly concentrated molecules to move across a membrane into areas of lower concentration until a balance is reached. This balance is called equilibrium. Conversely, sometimes molecules are moved fro m areas of low concentration to areas of higher concentration. This is the opposite of passive trans-port, so what do you think it is called? This process is called facilitate d or active trans- port. Active transport requires the cell to use energy. Y ou will read more about osmosis and diffusion in the Physical Science chapter. The cell wall is the layer outside of the mem- brane on plant cells. It is made of cellulose, which sur rounds, protects, and supports plant cells. Animal cells do not have a cell wall. Interior Parts of a Cell These are parts of a cell that will be useful to review: The nucleus is a spherical structure, often found near the c enter of a cell. It is surrounded by a nuclear membrane, and it contains genetic infor - mation inscribed along one or more molecules of DNA. The DNA acts as a library of information and a set of instructions for making new cells and cell components. In order to reproduce, every cell must be able to copy its genes to future genera-tions. This is done by exact duplication of the DNA. The nucleolus is located inside the nucleus. It is involved in the synthesis of ribosomes, which manufacture proteins. Cytoplasm is a fluid found within the cell mem-b rane but outside of the nucleus. Ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis. They ar e essential in cell maintenance and cell reproduction. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell. T hey are the sites of cellular respiration (break- down of chemical fuels to obtain energy) and pr oduction of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule that provides energy for many essential processes in all organisms. Cells that use a lot of energy, such as the cells of a human heart, have a large number of mitochondria. Mitochondria are unusual because, unlike other cell organelles, they contain their own DNA and make some of their own proteins. The endoplasmic reticulum is a series of inter - c onnecting membranes associated with the stor - age, synthesis, and transport of proteins and other mat erials within the cell. The Golgi complex is a series of small sacs that synthesiz es, packages, and secretes cellular prod- ucts to the plasma membrane. Its function is dire cting the transport of material within the cell and exporting material out of the cell. Lysosomes contain enzymes that help with intra- c ellular digestion. Lysosomes have a large pres- ence in cells that actively engage in phag ocytosis\u2014the process by which cells con- sume large particles of food. White blood cells that oft en engulf and digest bacteria and cellular debris are abundant in lysosomes. Vacuoles are found mainly in plants. They partic- ipat e in digestion and the maintenance of water balance in the c ell. Centrioles are cylindrical structures found in the cy toplasm of animal cells. They participate in cell division. Chloroplasts exist in the cells of plant leaves and in alg ae. They contain the green pigment chloro- phyll and are the site of photosynthesis\u2014the pro-cess of using sunlight to make high-energy sugar molecules. Ultimately, the food supply of most 273273 - - LIFE SCIENCE organisms depends on photosynthesis carried out by plants in the chloroplasts. Organization of Cells In a multicellular organism, individual cells specialize in different tasks. For example, red blood cells carry oxygen, white blood cells ght pathogens, and cells in plant leaves collect the energy from sunlight. This cellular organization enables an organism to lose and replace individual cells and consequently outlive the cells that it is composed of. For example, you can lose dead skin cells and give blood and still go on living. This differentiation or division of labor in multicellular organisms is accomplished by expres-sion of different genes within the cells. Considering the foregoing passages, let's see if you can pull information from what was presented to answer the following questions. Practice 1.

Facilitated transport and passive transport refer to w hat? __________________ reproduction and Heredity Once you've gotten a handle on how to think about cells, let's go a bit deeper into a specic set of cell pro-cesses\u2014reproduction and heredity. Reproduction is simply the process of an organism creating a new organism and passing along its genetic material. Heredity involves what an organism looks like and how it functions, and this is determined by its genetic material. Obviously, these two things are intrinsically related. Here's a fun fact: the basic principles of heredity we re developed by Gregor Mendel, who experi- mented with pea plants in the nineteenth century. He mathemat ically analyzed the inherited traits (such as color and size) of a large number of plants over many generations in order to understand how heredity works. The units of heredity are genes carried on chromosomes. Genetics, which is the study of genes, can usually explain why children look like their par - ents and why they are, at the same time, not identical to the par ents. Let's look at some of the key terms that will help you to understand questions about reproduction and heredity. Phenotype and Genotype The collection of physical and behavioral characteris-tics of an organism is called a phe notype. For exam- ple, your eye color, foot size, and ear shape are co mponents of your phenotype. If a puppy is born with brown eyes, what is this an example of? Phenotype! The genetic makeup of a cell or organism is calle d the genotype. Phenotype (what an organism looks like or how it acts) is determined by the geno-type (its genes) and its environment. By environment we don't mean the earth, but the environment sur - 274274 - - LIFE SCIENCE rounding the cell. For example, the hormones in a human mother's body can influence the gene expres-sion in a baby. Essentially, you can think of the geno-type as being like a cookbook for the recipe of the phe notype and the environment as being like the kitchen. Cellular Reproduction You may have heard the terms mitosis and meiosis. These are forms of cellular reproduction. Asexual reproduction on the cellular level is called mitosis. Because it is asexual, that means it requires only one parent cell, which, after exactly multiplying its genetic material, splits in two. The resulting cells are genetically identical to each other and are clones of the original cell. Since asexual reproduction requires only one pare nt cell, sexual reproduction requires how many parent cells? Two! Most cells in an organism that reproduces sexually have two copies of each chromo-some, called homolo gous pairs\u2014one from each par - ent. Even though an organism reproduces sexually, these c ells reproduce through mitosis to keep all the genetic material. Howeve r, there must be an exception to this r ule, right? Gamete cells (spe rm and egg cells) are excep- tions to the mitosis rule! They carry only one copy of eac h chromosome, so there are only half as many chromosomes as in the other cells. For example, human cells normally contain 46 chromosomes, but human sperm and egg cells have 23 chromosomes. Why would these cells do this? We ll, at fertiliza- tion, male and female gametes (sperm and egg) come to gether to form a zygote, the offspring, and the two sets of chromosomes join together to make sure the cell has the normal 46 chromosomes. This is how the genetic information of a zygote is a mixture of genetic information from both parents. Gamete cells are manufactured through a pro- cess called meiosis w hereby a cell multiplies its genetic material once but divides twice, producing four new cells, each of which contains half the num- ber of chromosomes that were present in the original ce ll before division. In humans, gametes are produced in testes and ovaries. Meiosis, and how it is used in sexual reproduction, is necessary for genetic diver - sity within a species by generating combinations of g enes that are different from those present in the par - ents. Genetic diversity is super important for healthy po pulations of any specic species. This is why pure- bred animals have very well documented genetic lines\u2014to a void inbreeding and unhealthy animals. Alleles are alternative versions of the same gene, s uch as the gene that determines whether a human has blue or brown eyes. An organism with two copies of the same allele is homozygous, and one with two different alleles is heterozygous. For example, a human with one gene for blue eyes and one gene for brown eyes is heterozygous, while a human with two genes for blue eyes or two genes for brown eyes is homozygous. In a heterozygous organism, whichever of the two genes is expressed (e.g., whether the human is brown-eyed or blue-eyed) is determined by the dominance of the gene. An allele is dominant if it alone determines the phenotype, or expression, of a heterozygote. If a plant has a gene for making yellow flowers and a gene for making red flowers, and the red flower gene is dominant, what color will the flowers be? If you said red, you're correct. A plant that has both the dominant gene for red and the gene for yel- low will still look red. The gene for yellow flowers in this case is called recessive, as it doesn't contribute to the phenotype (appearance) of a heterozygote (a plant containing two different alleles). What way would this plant make yellow flowers? The only way this plant would make yellow flow ers is if it had two recessive genes\u2014two genes both coding for yellow flowers. For some genes, dom-inance is only partial and two different alleles can be exp ressed. In the case of partial dominance, a plant 275275 n n n - - Plant (rr) r r R Plant (Rr) r Rr Rr rr rr Plant (Rr) R r R Plant (Rr) r RR Rr Rr rr Heterozygous Red Plant Crossed with Another Heterozygous Red Plant LIFE SCIENCE that has a gene that codes for red flowers and a gene that codes for white flowers would produce pink flowers. Punnett Squares A Punnett square is the visual representation of this type of heredity. It can be used to represent the pos-sible phenotypes that offspring of parents with know n genotypes could have. Here's how it works: The genes of one parent are listed on the left side of a grid. The genes of the other parent are listed on top of the grid. The genes are then combined to show offspring in the grid. L et's look at the example with the yellow and red flow ers. Let's label the allele for the dominant red gene as R and the allele for yellow flowers as r. Cross a plant with yellow flowers (genotype must be rr) with a plant with red flowers and genotype Rr. A genotype of RR or rr is considered homozygous. A genotype of Rr is considered heterozygous. What possible genotypes and phenotypes can the o ffspring have? Remember, in a Punnett square, the genes of one parent are listed on one side of the square and the genes of the other parent on top of the square. They are then combined in the offspring as illustrated here: Homozygous Y ellow Plant Crossed with Heterozygous Red Plant The possible genotypes of the offspring are listed inside the square. Their genotype will be either Rr or rr, causing them to be either red or yellow, respectively. 50% of the offspring would be homozygous yel- lo w (rr ) 50% of the offspring would be heterozygous red (Rr) W hat happens if we breed two of the offspring (het- erozygous red\u2014Rr)? What w ould the percentages be then? Then the Punnett square would look like this: 25% would be homozygous yellow (rr ) 50% would be heterozygous red (Rr) 25% would be homozygous red (RR) Practice Answer the following questions. Consider using a Punne tt square to help you. 4. Angelsh come in a number of different color - ations. Black angelsh have the genotype (DD), indicating that the b lack gene is dominant.

Sex Determination In many organisms, one of the sexes can have a pair of unmatched chromosomes. In humans, the male has an X chromosome and a much smaller Y chro-mosome, while the female has two X chromosomes. The combination XX (female) or XY (male) deter - mines the sex of humans. In birds, the males have a matc hed pair of sex chromosomes (WW), while females have an unmatched pair (WZ). In humans, the sex chromosome supplied by the male determines the sex of the offspring. In birds, the sex chromosome supplied by the female determines the sex. Plants, as well as many animals, lack sex chromosomes. The sex of these organisms is determined by other factors, such as plant hormones or temperature. Identical twins result when a fertilized egg splits in tw o. Identical twins have identical chromosomes and can be either two girls or two boys. Two children of different sex born at the same time can't be identi-cal twins and are instead fraternal. Fraternal twins can also be of the same sex. They are genetically not any more alike than siblings born at different times. Fraternal twins result when two different eggs are fer - tilized by two different sperm cells. Mutation Changes in DNA (mutations) occur randomly and spontaneously at low rates. Mutations occur more frequently when DNA is exposed to mutagens, including ultraviolet light, X-rays, and certain chemi-cals. Most mutations either are harmful to or don't affe ct the organism. In rare cases, however, a muta- tion can be benecial to an organism and can help it sur vive or reproduce, like polar bears having a mutation for white fur. Ultimately, genetic diversity de pends on mutations, as mutations are the only source of completely new genetic material. Only mutations in germ cells can create the variation that changes an organism's offspring. Evolution Evolution is the theory that explains how life devel-oped on earth. It explains the diversity of forms of life, including the vast array of various species across all types of plants and animals. Through a process of natural selection, certain genes or gene combinations give individuals mem-bers of a species an edge in surviving in the natural wo rld. Such changes, or adaptations, are passed down to future generations and eventually\u2014over very long periods of time\u2014create variations in species or new species altogether. Evidence for Evolution Several factors have led scientists to accept the theory of evolution. Fossil Record One of the most convincing forms of evidence is the fossil record. Fossils are the remains of past life, often in the form of impressions in mud and debris that has since turned into sedimentary rocks, which form during compression of settling mud, debris, and sand. The order of layers of sedimentary rock is con-sistent with the proposed sequence in which life on Earth evolved. The simplest organisms are located at the bottom layer, while top layers contain increasingly complex and modern organisms; this reflects a pat-tern that suggests evolution. The process of carb on dating, which is the calculation of the consistent rate of carbon decay over time, has been used to conrm how old the fossils are. It also is used to determine that fossils found in the lower layers of sedimentary rock are indeed older than the ones found in the 277277 - - LIFE SCIENCE higher layers. This helps scientists to chart evolution- ary history based on time. New fossils are turning up all the time; for example, the fossil called Tiktaalik, which was found in 2004, is believed to mark the transition from sh to land animals. Biogeography Another form of evidence comes from the fact that spe cies tend to resemble nearby species in different habitats more than they resemble species that are in similar habitats but far away. For example, there are marsupials in both North America (opossums) and Australia (possums, koalas, kangaroos, wombats, etc.), but the opossums have white and gray fur and look entirely different from the Australian possums and other marsupials. Comparative Anatomy Comparative anatomy provides us with another line of evidence. It refers to the fact that the limb bones of different species, for example, are similar. Species that closely resemble one another are considered to be more closely related than species that do not resem-ble one another. For example, a horse and a donkey are considered to be more closely related than are a horse and a frog. Biological classications (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species) are based on how organisms are related. Organisms are classied into a hierarchy of gr oups and subgroups based on similarities that reflect their evolutionary relationships. The same underlying anatomical structures of groups of bones, nerves, muscles, and organs are found in all animals, even when the functions of these underlying struc-tures differ. Embryology Embryology provides another form of evidence for ev olution. Embryos go through the developmental stages of their ancestors to some degree. The early embryos of sh, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals all have common features, such as tails. Comparative Molecular Biology Comparative molecular biology studies the related-ness of two different species by comparing their DNA. These studies at the molecular level conrm the lines of descent suggested by comparative anat-omy and fossil records. Selection and Adaptation Darwin also proposed that evolution occurs gradu-ally, through mutations and natural selection. He argued that some genes or combinations of genes give an individual a survival or reproductive advan-tage, increasing the chance that these useful combina-tions of genes will make it to future generations. Whe ther a given trait is advantageous depends on the environment of the organism. One example of natural selection can be seen in antib iotic-resistant bacteria. When a drug is used on a species of bacteria, those that cannot resist die and do not produce offspring. Those bacteria that survive pass on the resistance gene to the next generation. Over time, the population of bacteria will become resistant to the antibiotic. What other possible forms of natural selection can you think o f? Natural selection is only one of several mecha- nisms by which gene frequency changes in a popula-tion. Other factors include mating patterns and br eeding between populations. Mating patterns, as an example, may account for why in certain species of birds, such as cardinals and peacocks, the male birds are very brightly colored while the female birds are less so. A contrast to natural selection is art icial selec- tion (or selective breeding)\u2014the process by which far mers or breeders intentionally select for desirable characteristics or traits (e.g., disease resistance, size, etc.). Only individuals with the desired trait are allowed to breed. Another way in which organisms change is that ov er time, living organisms adapt to their environ - ments. Adaptation i s the process of developing specic 278278 - - LIFE SCIENCE advantageous features. An adaptation may also be the feature itself. These features may be anatomical (physi - cal features of the body), such as a certain color wing th at provides protection from predators by camouflage or fur that allows a predator to get closer to its prey unseen. An adaptation may also be behavioral, such as a certain way of evading predators. For example, some tiger moths confuse their predators, bats, by emitting ultrasonic clicks that jam the bats' echolocation. In the context of evolution, individuals with ce rtain adaptive traits tend to be more successful reproductively\u2014meaning that they produce more offspring. And what happens to that trait (if you remember back to reproduction and heredity)? Yes, the offspring will inherit the adaptive traits from their parents. Any time a trait results in a reproductive advantage in a population, selection pressure is occurring. Think of selection pressure as an evolu-tionary push or pressure on the population toward the adap tive trait. A species is dened as a group that can inter - breed and produce viable offspring. Spe ciation is the evolutionary process by which a new species emerges. As you can imagine, speciation occurs very slowly. Practice 6. The fossil record provides evidence for the pro- cess of evolution. Another form of evidence for ev olution comes from the eld of biogeogra- phy. Species in different but nearby habitats te nd to resemble each other more closely than they resemble species in similar habitats farther away. Which statement explains how this is evi-dence for evolution? a. Neighboring species in different habitats oft en can share a common ancestor. b. Species are less likely to interbreed with their neig hbors, and over time they will resemble species farther away. c. Species are more likely to interbreed with spe cies farther away, and over time they will resemble species farther away. d. Species are not likely to interbreed at all. 7. The peppered moth lives in the United King-dom and has both light and dark variations. Dur ing the Industrial Revolution (1760-1840), many of the trees on which the moths lived became covered with dark soot. Over a period of just 50 years, the population of peppered moths in Manchester, England, changed so that almost the entire local population was made up of dark moths. After the Clean Air Act of 1956, the air quality changed and so did the population of peppered moths; dark moths became rare. This information is an example of: a. speciation b. meiosis c. extinction d. natural selection 8. Speciation, or cladogenesis, is the formation of new sp ecies over time. During allopatric spe- ciation, a species is split geographically into two (o r more) isolated populations. Over time new species emerge. This process provides evi-dence for the theory of ______________. The Human Body and Health Since we've reviewed some of the basic elements of life, let's take a look close to home at the human body. The human body is made up of cells, as are all living things. These cells take different characteristics, depending on their purpose, and are organized into systems that govern the functions of the human body, such as the skeletal or nervous system. Organization and Function The organization of the body is good to keep in mind, and of course goes from smallest part to larger part. In this case cells, the smallest part of the body, are organized into tissues. Muscle tissue, for example, is made up of muscle cells. Tissues then make up 279279 Cells Tissues Organs Body Systems Levels of Biological Organization - - LIFE SCIENCE organs, and nally organs (e.g., liver, heart, brain, kidneys) make up body systems. The body systems interact with each other to make sure the human body functions properly. The Nervous System The nervous system allows us to monitor and interact with the environment around us. It is made up of the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system (the nerves that transport signals to and from the brain). Messages are sent from our sense organs via nerves to other body systems. Our sense organs include the eyes, nose, ears, skin, and tongue. The nervous system is the boss of the body sys- tems and coordinates all of the systems working with one another to maintain a state of balance or homeo- stasis (function within a normal range). For example, shi vering, goose bumps, and sweating are your body's response to being too cold or too hot. If your skin and spinal cord sense cold, they send signals to the muscles to contract and shiver. In contrast, as your temperature rises, the blood vessels in your skin get larger. This process, called vasodilation, allows for cooling of the blood. Sweat glands are also activated when you are hot in an attempt to cool the body and return to homeostasis. The Musculoskeletal System The musculoskeletal system includes your bones\u2014all 206 o f them\u2014as well as your ligaments, muscles, ten- dons, and cartilage. The bones meet at joints and are held together by ligaments. Bones are connected to the muscles through the tendons. Cartilage is flexible connective tissue (in the tip of your nose and ears, for instanc e) and is found in some of your joints, like the knee. The Circulatory System The circulatory system moves blood through the bo dy. It includes the heart, blood, and blood vessels. The function of blood is to carry nutrients and oxy-gen to the cells and to transport waste products from ce lls. Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart. Veins carry blood back to the heart. The lymphatic system is also part of the circulatory system. It col-lects excess tissue fluids. Have you ever had swollen glands? If so, you have felt your lymphatic system at work. The Respiratory System The respiratory system helps in breathing and remov-ing waste products from our bodies. Some important parts of the respiratory system are the lungs, the lar - ynx, and the diaphragm, which is a thick muscle that is j ust beneath the lungs. The diaphragm controls the mechanism of breathing by contracting during inha-lation and relaxing during exhalation. Oxygen moves into the blood and carbon dioxide is taken out of the lungs at the alveoli. The Digestive System Your digestive system is made up of organs that break do wn the food you eat into usable molecules that can be absorbed by the blood. These molecules are neces-sary for life. The breakdown of food starts in the mouth with the enzymes found in saliva. Food then passes through the esophagus to the stomach. Enzymes in the stomach further break down food. The liver produces bile (stored in the gallbladder), which breaks down fat into small droplets. When partially digested food enters the small intestine, the gallbladder releases bile into the intestine to help fur - ther break down food. The pancreas secretes a fluid that helps break do wn starches, fats, and proteins. The lining of the 280280 - - LIFE SCIENCE small intestine has many tiny folds called microvilli, which absorb the products of digestion and transfer them to the circulatory system. The large intestine or colon is the last part of the digestive system. The function of the large intestine is to collect waste prod-ucts. The waste products of digestion, or feces, are re moved through the rectum and anus. Most of the structures that make up living org anisms are made from amino acids, carbohy- drates, and lipids (often called fats). Me tabolism is the process of building amino acids and other mole-cules needed for life (as during the construction of ce lls and tissues) or breaking them down and using them as a source of energy, as in the digestion and use of food. Within cells, the mitochondria perform this process. The body needs nutrients to function properly. We get nutrients from the foods we eat. The nutrients that a body needs vary depending on the calories that a person burns in a day. A calorie is the way we mea-sure energy in food. For example, a moderately active 30-year -old male of average height and weight needs about 2,600 calories daily to maintain weight. A 30-year-old moderately active female needs approxi-mately 2,200 calories daily to maintain weight. A calorie is a unit of energy. Technically, a calo- rie is the energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gr am of water 1\u00b0C (usually dened as 4.184 joules). Most of us think of calories in relation to food, as in \"This apple has 100 calories.\" It turns out that the cal-ories stated on a food package are actually kilocalo - ries (1,000 calories = 1 kilocalorie). A food calorie c ontains 4,184 joules. A can of soda containing 200 food calories contains 200,000 regular calories, or 200 kilocalories. A gallon of gasoline contains 31,000 kilocalories. When you consider this information, how many re gular calories does a moderately active 30-year-old male of average height and weight need to maintain weight? The answer is 2,600,000 calories! The Endocrine System The endocrine system is made up of glands in differ - ent parts of the body. The thyroid, parathyroid, thy-mus, pancreas, and pituitary are all glands of the end ocrine system. Along with helping the digestive system, these glands send out chemical messages via hormones to the rest of the body. Hormones are car - ried in the blood. Just as the nervous system works to maintain ho meostasis in the body, the glands in the endocrine system regulate themselves with a type of feedback system that works to keep things in homeostasis. An example of how the endocrine system regu- lates itself, and what happens in a disease state, can be see n in glucose (sugar) regulation in the blood. Eating produces increase in glucose in blood. High level of glucose stimulates pancreas to produce insulin. Insulin in blood causes liver and muscles to absorb glucose. Reduced glucose level inhibits pancreas from producing more insulin. Feedback Mechanism in Glucose Regulation In diabetes, a metabolic disorder, parts of this system are impaired or do not function. In type 1 diabetes, the body does not produce insulin at all. People with this kind of diabetes have to take insulin throughout their lives. People with type 2 diabetes have difculty 281281 - - LIFE SCIENCE using the insulin that is produced by the pancreas. It often builds up in their blood, which means their cells are not getting the sugar they need. Treatment is necessary for the body to function properly since the endocrine system is unable to create homeostasis itself. The Reproductive System Finally, we discuss the reproductive system, as all liv-ing organisms reproduce. Some very simple organ-isms just divide into two. Other organisms, including humans, ha ve developed complex sexual reproduc- tion systems. Sexual reproduction for humans invol ves the joining of two gametes, an egg (female gamete) and a sperm (male gamete). Each of the gametes carries part of that parent's genetic code (DNA), so the offspring will contain genetic informa-tion from each of the parents. Practice 9.

Which is an example of your body trying to maintain homeostasis? a. b leeding b. urination c. sweating d. digestion Disease and Illness All living things are subject to disease and illness. Dis-ease can be classied as either infectious or noninfec-tious. However, the symptoms involved in both can be similar. Infectious Disease Many diseases are caused by pathogens that invade a host body. Pathogens need a host in order to survive and multiply. Some examples of pathogens are bacte-ria, viruses, and fungi. These pathogens can spread through dir ect body contact, body fluids, and con- tact with an object that an infected person has touche d (some viruses, like the common cold virus, can exist outside the body for a brief period before they get passed on to another host). One way indi-viduals can protect themselves from infection from these pathoge ns is by hand washing. Other diseases are transmitted through the air. This kind of disease is called an airborne disease. In this case, viruses, bacteria, or fungi can be spread through coughing, sneezing, dust, spraying of liquids, or other activities that create aerosol particles or droplets. Tuberculosis is an example of an airborne 282282 - - LIFE SCIENCE n n n disease. Tuberculosis is also an infectious disease. Treatment and vaccines for tuberculosis exist, and this disease has been almost eliminated in some parts of the world. However, the total number of people in the world infected with tuberculosis keeps growing. Individuals can prevent infection from airborne dis-eases by avoiding close contact with infected persons. Blood-borne vir uses are transmitted through the blood or bodily fluids. HIV is an example of a blood-borne virus; there is no chance of contracting the virus unless one comes in contact with the blood or bodily fluids of an infected person. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) ar e dis- eases that are frequently transmitted through sexual co ntact. HIV is also an example of an STD, as are gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, human papillomavi-rus (HPV), and herpes. Many STDs, including HIV and her pes, are incurable. There is a vaccine for HPV. Noninfectious Disease If a disease cannot spread from person to person, then it is considered noninfectious. Two examples of noninfectious diseases are cancer and heart disease. Noninfectious diseases can be classied as fol- lows: Hereditary diseases. Hereditary diseases are cause d by genetic disorders that are passed down from previous generations. Since they are inher - ited, they are more difcult to treat because they are a par t of a person's genetic makeup. Age-related diseases. Some diseases start to d evelop as the body gets older and does not work as efciently to battle routine diseases and degen - erative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Alzhe imer's disease causes mild to severe memory loss or distortion, forgetfulness, anxiety, and sometimes aggressive behavior. Environmentally induced diseases. A n environ- ment that has been polluted with toxins and haz-ardous waste can affect the population living in or ar ound it. Toxic chemicals in polluted ground- water can cause cancer. Exposure to asbestos can lead t o serious lung problems. Staying healthy by taking care of the body is impor - tant in ghting and preventing disease. Diet and life-style are major factors that can influence susceptibility to many diseases. Drug abuse, smoking, drinking alcohol, and poor diet, as well as a lack of exercise may increase the risk of developing certain diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers. Recently, scientists and physicians have reported that the numbers of younger people devel-oping diseases (such as type 2 diabetes) are increas-ing. This is likely related to the increasing rate of ob esity among young people. Since 1980, the number of overweight children has doubled and the number of overweight adolescents has tripled. Looking for Symptoms Before diagnosing a patient with a disease, a doctor looks for telltale symptoms. Every disease has specic symptoms that cause different reactions in the body. Some common symptoms present in many illnesses are fever, nausea, and pain. A doctor is trained to look for symptoms to give a correct diagnosis and issue proper treatment. Specic blood tests and X-rays are special methods that are used to diagnose some diseases. Epidemics An epidemic is a disease outbreak that has infected a considerable portion of the population and that con-tinues to spread rapidly. Epidemics can occur when ther e is no medicine for the disease, when diseases develop a resistance to medicine and drugs, or when environmental conditions are favorable for a specic 283283 - - 284LIFE SCIENCE 284 type of disease. For example, cancer is rampant in areas with toxic chemicals and high levels of radia- tion. Autoimmune deciency syndrome (AIDS), which is caused by the HIV virus, is an epidemic that has killed millions of people worldwide. Natural and Medical Defenses Humans and most other living beings have a natural built-in disease-ghting mechanism known as the immune system. The immune system is composed of cells, molecules, and organs that defend the body against pathogens. The immune system is responsible for nding the pathogen in the body and killing it, rendering it harmless, or expelling it from the body. The development and use of vaccines and anti- biotics have added to our defenses against diseases. Not only have advances in medicine found ways to ght disease from inside the body, but methods have also been developed to prevent the onset of disease. Vaccines Vaccines are usually made from either a dead version of an actual organism known to cause an immune response (such as a virus) or from a weakened or inactive form of the organism. By presenting the body with a weaker or deactivated form of an organ- ism that would normally make a person very ill, the body will produce an immune response without causing any illness. Then if the body ever comes in contact with the strong form of a virus, the antibod- ies that were formed during the immune response to the weaker version will be able to ght off this strong version. Some people are concerned about the safety of vaccines, but scientists have not found any signicant safety concerns related to vaccinations. In the United States, all vaccines must be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and go through extensive testing and trials before they can be used. Some very serious diseases, including smallpox, mea-sles, and polio, have been almost eradicated through vaccination. Measles in the United States, 1950-2007 1950 Vaccine Licensed 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 Cases (thousands) 900 800 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), vaccines save approximately nine million lives annually around the world. Antibiotics and Resistance Antibiotics are chemical compounds that kill bacteria without harming our own cells. Some antibiotics, such as penicillin, kill bacteria by preventing it from synthesizing a cell wall. Other antibiotics interfere with bacterial growth by disrupting their genes or protein production. Bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics\u2014there are strains of bacteria that are resistant to every known antibiotic. In every population, a small number of bacteria naturally have genes that make them resistant to anti-biotics. With increased exposure to antibiotics, a nor- mal population of ba cteria, a few of w hich are resistant, becomes resistant on average. This is a result of natural selection. The bacteria that survive are the ones that are resistant. Their offspring are also resistant, and as a result, the whole population becomes resistant. Some resistance enables bacteria to survive in the presence of an antibiotic. Another kind of resis- tance enables the bacteria to actually destroy the of resistance is most dangerous. For example, someone who took antibiotics for treating acne could accumulate bacteria that are capable of destroying the antibiotic. If that same person became infected with a serious disease that is treated with the same antibiotic, the resistant bacteria could destroy the antibiotic before it was able to act on the disease. Practice 12. Read the following passage and design a con- trolled experiment that the county health depar tment can use to determine the effective- ness of an intervention. Include descriptions of data colle ction and how the health department will determine if its hypothesis is correct. Today about 30% of children in the United States are overweight or obese. This puts them at increased risk for diseases such as diabetes (measured by fasting glucose lev-els) and heart disease (due to high choles-terol levels). The local county health dep artment wants to improve the health of the young children in the community. Most research indicates that changing diet and exercise is the best way to reduce obesity in children, but the health department sus-pects that children may not be willing to cha nge both diet and exercise. The county health department under - takes a new program to encourage children to e at better and exercise. The department enrolls 200 children in a six-month program. n Intervention 1: diet and exer cise n Intervention 2: diet only n Intervention 3: exercise only The county health department hypothesizes tha t the children in the diet and exercise group will have the best outcomes. Write your answer on the following lines or on a sep- arate sheet of paper. This task may require approxi-mately ten minutes to complete. Ecological n etworks Just as the human body has systems, an ecological community also has a network. The many species in a community interact in many ways, competing for space and resources, sometimes as predator and prey, or as host and parasite. Flow of Energy in Ecosystems The energy in an ecosystem always flows in a specic direction. Starting with plants and other photosyn-thesizing organisms, they harness and convert solar energ y and supply the rest of the food chain. They are considered producers. Herbivores (plant eaters) are next on the energy flow, as they obtain energy directly from plants and are considered primary consumers. Carnivores are meat eaters and obtain energy by eat-ing other animals, so they are considered secondary cons umers. Omnivores eat both meat and plants (ter - tiary consumers), while decomposers feed on dead organisms. The flow of energy can then be repre- sented as follows: 285285 n n n - - LIFE SCIENCE Flow of Energy in Ecosystem Food Chain Producers are greater in number in most ecosystems than primary, secondary, and tertiary consumers, as shown in the diagram. Think about the number of insects versus the number of foxes in one forest eco-system, for example. If the foxes were to outnumber the insec ts or the plants, they would soon starve. Tertiary Consumers Secondary Consumers Primary Consumers Producers High LowSmall Large Population Energy Energy Flow and Population Size in Ecosystems The food chain is not the only example of the inter - dependence of organisms. Species often have to com- pete for food and space, so the increase in population of one can cause the decrease in population of the other. Organisms also may have a symbiotic relation-ship (live in close association), which could be classi-ed as parasitism, commensalism, or mutualism. In a parasitic relationship, one organism benets at the expense of the other. Commensalism is symbiosis in which one organ-ism benets and the other is neither harmed nor rewarded. In mutualism, both organisms benet. U nder ideal conditions, with ample food and space and no predators, all living organisms have the capac- ity to reproduce innitely. However, resources are limite d, limiting the population of a species. This is called the carrying capacity of the population. The carrying capacity of a population is the maximum population size that the environment can sustain given the necessary resources (food, habitat, water) available in the environment. Expanding beyond that will usually result in the organisms self-limiting by moving away or not procreating or the organisms overwhelming that environment. Practice Select from the following three terms to ll in the blanks in q uestions 13-15. n mutualism n parasitism n commensalism 13. African oxpeckers feed on the insects that are on the ba cks of zebras and other large African animals. This is an example of ________, a type of symbiotic relationship. 14. Lice feed on the skin and blood of the host. This is an e xample of ________, a type of sym- biotic relationship. 15. Some spiders build their webs on blades of gr ass. This is an example of ________, a type of symbiotic relationship. 286286 - - LIFE SCIENCE Humans' Influence on the Environment Humans may be the exception to the carrying capac - ity rule, as our species probably comes closest to ha ving a seemingly innite reproductive capacity. The population keeps increasing. When we need more food, we grow more, and when we need more space, we clear some and end up damaging or even destroying other ecosystems. Humans modify eco - systems and destroy habitats through direct harvest-ing, pollution, atmospheric changes, and other fa ctors. These actions are threatening current global stability and have the potential to cause irreparable damage. Climate change is one example of the impact hu mans have on their environment. Scientists now agree that the climate is changing as a result of human activities. Warming of the atmosphere results from increased levels of carbon dioxide and other gases (greenhouse gases), which produce a greenhouse effect . The greenhouse effect occurs when the sun's rays, after hitting the earth's crust and bouncing back into space, get trapped in the atmosphere because of the greenhouse gases. What happens when the rays cannot escape the earth's atmosphere? The trapped heat causes a rise in global temperature. There are other visible examples of how human be havior can disrupt ecosystems. Invasive species ar e animal or plant species that are non-native and invade or take over the niche of a native species of an ecosystem. They can have a substantial negative impact on an ecosystem because they use resources such as nutrients, light, physical space, water, or food that the native species need to survive. The relationship to human behav - ior is that invasive species are sometimes purposely or accidentally introduced by humans into an eco - system. An example of an invasive species that you may be familiar with is the kudzu vine, now very common in the southeastern United States. Desertication is anothe r area of human influ- ence on the environment. This particular situation oc curs when an already dry land area becomes increasingly arid and is less able to support plants and animals. Humans contribute to desertication of ecosystems through deforestation (often for fuel or for construction materials), overgrazing, and poor farming practices. The impact of humans on an environment is oft en catastrophic. Awareness of the human influence is important for understanding the breaks in some ecological networks. 287287 - - LIFE SCIENCE Life Science r eview 1.

Phe notype is the physical or behavioral expression of a gene (e.g., eye color, hair color). Choice a is incorrect because a genotype is the genetic coding. Choice b is incorrect because an allele is an alternative version of the same gene. Choice c is also incorrect because mitosis is a process of cell division. 6. a. C hoice a explains how one species can diverge into two species over time when divided into two separate habitats. A classic example of this is the case of Darwin's nches on the Gala-pagos Islands, where nch species diverged fr om a common ancestor to adapt to the unique habitats of each island. Answer choices b, c, and d do not explain how biogeography is evidence for evolution. 7. d. A ccording to natural selection, whether a given trait is advantageous depends on the envi-ronment of the organism. In this case the moths that w ere better camouflaged (those that were the color of the soot-covered trees) survived and reproduced. No new species developed, and therefore this is not an example of speciation (choice a). Meiosis (choice b) is cell division. This is not an example of extinction (when there are no more individuals of a species left alive); therefore, choice c is not correct. 8. This process provides evidence for the theory of e volution. Evolution is the gradual change of inherited characteristics in a population over time. 291291 - - LIFE SCIENCE 9. a. mo vement: musculoskeletal system, which provides structure and allows for movement. b. breathing: r espiratory system, consisting of the organs that help with inhaling and exhaling. c. metabolism: dig estive system, consisting of the organs that aid in breaking down food. d. homeostasis: ne rvous system, which is pri- marily responsible for maintaining functioning w ithin a normal range. e. blood flow: cir culatory system, which con- trols blood flow through the body. f. hormone regulation: e ndocrine system, made up of glands that regulate hormones in the body. g. reproduction: r eproductive system, consist- ing of the organs involved in producing o ffspring. 10. a. C ells are the smallest and simplest unit in an organism. Tissues are made up of cells (e.g., muscle tissue is made of muscle cells).

S weating is an example of the body trying to maintain homeostasis through evaporative cooling. Choice a is incorrect because bleeding is a result of an injury to the body and does not result in homeostasis. Urination is the excretion of waste products, not the body trying to main- tain homeostasis, so choice b is incorrect. C hoice d is incorrect because digestion is the process of breaking down the food we eat so it can be used by our body for fuel. It in itself is not a process for maintaining homeostasis. 12.

They would take height, weight, cholesterol levels, and fasting blood glucose levels. They would also need to ask questions about the diet of the children and the amount of exercise they do on a daily basis. The children in group 1 (diet and exercise) w ould be on a diet lower in fat and sugar (weekly menus provided by the health department) and would be asked to double the amount of exercise they do in a week (e.g., if they normally exercise 20 min-utes per week, then they will be asked to exercise 40 min utes per week). (Note: If they normally don't exercise at all, then they would be asked to exercise 30 minutes per day three times per week.) Parents would be asked to keep a food log and record the exercise on a daily basis. The children in group 2 (diet change only) w ould be on the same reduced-fat and lower-sugar diet as the children in group 1 but would not change their exercise routine. Parents would be asked to keep a food log and record the exercise on a daily basis. The children in group 3 (exercise change only) w ould not be asked to change their diet but would be asked to double the amount of exercise they do on a weekly basis, as in group 1. Parents would be asked to keep a food log and record the exercise on a daily basis. The children in the control group would not be ask ed to change anything, but parents would be asked to keep a food log and record the exercise on a daily basis. After the conclusion of the experiment, the health department could compare the weight, choles- terol levels, and fasting blood glucose levels of the g roups and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the interventions. 13. mutualism. I n this case, both the oxpeckers and zebras are beneting, which describes a mutual-istic relationship. Oxpeckers get food, and the host animals are relieved of the bothersome insects. 14. parasitism. The lice are beneting, and the hosts ar e being deprived of blood and skin, which is clearly a parasitic relationship. 15. commensalism. Spiders are using the grass as a pla ce to build their nest, but there is no impact on the grass, positive or negative. Life Science Review 1. a. T he only conclusion you can draw based on the information in the graph is that the para- sitic mites may have contributed to the decline in b ee populations; therefore, choice a is the correct answer. The graph does not support a causal relationship. The bee population was generally in decline prior to the introduction in 1983, so we cannot conclude denitively that the mites caused the decline, so choice b is incorrect. Although there is a downward trend in the population, there is no way to conclude that the population will go extinct, so choice c is incorrect. Choice d is incorrect because there was a general decline (not an increase) in the population prior to the introduction of the mite. 293293 - - LIFE SCIENCE 2. d. T he question states that tapeworms are ben-eting and the hosts (cows, pigs, humans) are b eing deprived of nutrition, which is a parasitic relationship. Parasitism describes a relationship between two organisms where one benets at the expense of the other. Choice a is incorrect because mutualism is a relationship in which both organisms benet, and the host animals do not benet from the tapeworms. Commen- salism describes a benet for one organism and no har m or benet to the other; therefore, choice b is incorrect because the hosts are being deprived of food by the tapeworm. Speciation is the development of a new species and is not related to types of symbiotic relationships, so choice c is incorrect. 3. After 10,000 years, 30% of the sample remains. 4. After 25,000 years, 5% of the sample remains. 5. The bone is roughly 12,500 years old. 6. Only Species in different habitats often can share a c ommon ancestor is evidence of evolution. It explains how one species can diverge into two species over time when divided into two sepa-rate habitats. A classic example of this is the case o f nches on the Galapagos Islands, where nch species diverged from a common ancestor to adapt to the unique habitats of each island. 7. a. All cells contain genetic material, so choice a is not true. Choice b, choice c, and choice d are all true statements. 8. Recessive eye color genes: cell production: meiosis 10. c. S omeone who takes antibiotics for treating acne could accumulate bacteria that are capable of destroying the antibiotic. If that same person becomes infected with a serious disease that is treated with the same antibiotic, the resistant bacteria could destroy the antibiotic before it is able to act on the disease. 11.

Matter has mass and takes up space. It can interact with other matter and with energy, and these interactions form the basis of physical and chemical reactions. But what actually is matter? Atoms You and e ver y thing around you are composed of tiny particles called atoms. The book you are read- ing, the neurons in your brain, and the air that you are breathing are all collections of various atoms. Atoms make up matter. Atoms are also the smallest known complete particle. Let's look at the history of the atom. The term atom , which means indivisible, was coined by Greek philosopher Democritus (460-370 B.C.). He disagreed with Plato and Aristotle\u2014who believed that matter could be innitely divided into smaller and smaller pieces\u2014and postulated that mat-ter is composed of tiny indivisible particles. In spite of Democritus, the belief that matter could be innitely divided lingered until the early 1800s, when John Dalton formulated a meaningful atomic theory. It stated: Matter is composed of atoms. All atoms of a given element are identical. Atoms of different elements are different and have different properties. Atoms are neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine. A given compound always has the same relative number and kinds of atoms. These theories are still used today, but there's more to know about atoms. Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons An atom is composed of a nucleus surrounded by electrons. The nucleus contains positively charged particles called protons and uncharged (neutral) par- ticles called neutrons. Electrons are the negatively charged particles orbiting the nucleus. Remember that atoms, as the most basic com- ponent of matter, have mass. To dene that mass, sci- entists have determined that neutrons and protons have a mass of about 1 atomic mass unit, abbreviated amu. An amu is equivalent to about 1.66 10 -24 g. That is a very small mass. Electrons, in comparison, have a mass that is 1approximately _____ 1,836 that of a proton. Electrons are not simply just the orbitals around the nucleus. The ones orbiting in the outermost elec- tron shell (the orbit of the electrons) are called valence electrons. Valence electrons are most respon- sible for the properties and reaction patterns of an element to other elements and atoms. In a neutral atom, the number of protons and electrons is equal. A negatively charged atom has more electrons than protons, and a positively charged atom has more pro- tons than electrons. The reason the atom stays together at all is that the negatively charged electrons are attracted to the positively charged nucleus. While this attractive force holds an atom together, the nucleus itself is held together by strong nuclear forces. - - - - - - + + + + Electron Electron Orbit Nucleus (6 protons + 6 neutro ns) Proton Neutro n Structure of a Carbon Atom - - PHYSICAL SCIENCE n n n n Periodic Table of Elements Scientists have been trying to understand the ele- ments of matter through the use of organizational tables since the 1700s. We call the current organiza- tional structure the Pe riodic Table of Elements. As of 2014, the periodic table contains 118 conrmed chemical elements. The table organizes elements by their properties and he lps scientists predict the discovery of new ele- ments. It is a critical tool for understanding how ele-ments react with each other. Each block in the table descr ibes a different element. Understanding how to read the periodic table is criti - cal to understanding how elements will react with eac h other. Being able to read a block of the table is useful for the GED\u00ae Science test. Look at this exam-ple, the block for carbon: Carbon Entry in the Periodic Table of Elements The numeral 6 refers to the atomic number, which is the number of protons in the nucleus. C refers to the abbreviation for carbon. Carbon is the common name of the element writ- t en out under the abbreviation. 2:011 is the average weight of the atomic mass in the nucleus of the element's isotopes. Molecules Molecules are the next step up in terms of parts of matter. They are composed of two or more atoms held together in molecules by chemical bonds. These chemical bonds can be ionic or covalent bonds, which are related to how the valence electrons interact between atoms. Specically, ionic bonds form when one atom donates one or more electrons to another. Covalent bonds form when the electrons are shared between atoms. With the atoms bonded together to create a molecule, the mass of that molecule can be calculated by adding the masses of its component atoms. 297297 n n n n n n n n n n - - PHYSICAL SCIENCE Something that you will most likely see in ques- tions on the GED\u00ae Science test is the symbol of an element with a number in a subscript after it. This is shown in a chemical formula and is the number of atoms of a given element in a molecule. For example, the glucose (sugar) molecule is represented as C6H12O6. This formula tells you that the glucose mol- ecule contains 6 carbon atoms (C), 12 hydrogen atoms (H), and 6 oxygen atoms (O). In some cases, you may end up with two chemical formulas interact-ing and will have to solve what the new formula could be. States of Matter Molecules relate to matter, which we've discussed briefly, in that matter itself is held together by inter - molecular forces\u2014forces between diffe rent molecules. A solid has a xed shape and volume. The m olecules in a solid have a regular, ordered arrangement and vibrate in place but are unable to move far. Examples of matter in solid form include diamonds (carbon atoms) ice (water molecules) metal alloys (mixtures of different metals) Liq uids flow, and their d ensity (mass per unit volume) is usually lower than the density of solids. Liquids have a xed volume but take the shape of the container they are in. The molecules in a liquid are not ordered and can move from one region to another through a process called diffusion. Examples of matter in liquid form include mercury (mercury atoms) vinegar (molecules of acetic acid) perfume (a mixture of liquids made of different molecules) Gases take the shape and volume of the container the y are in and can be compressed when pressure is applied. The molecules in gases are disordered and move quickly. The density of gas is much lower than the density of a liquid. Examples of matter in gaseous form include helium gas (helium atoms) water vapor (molecules of water) air (mixture of different molecules, including nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and water vapor) Density is calculated by dividing mass by volume: Density = mass/volume The size and mass of a substance can change, but its density (at a particular temperature) will always remain constant regardless of the size. For example, at 20\u00b0C, a very small piece of aluminum will have the same density (2.70 g/cm 3) as a large piece of aluminum. These may seem like hard rules regarding states of matter, but matter can change its state depending on various factors. Changes of State Changes of state, or phase changes, involve the tran- sition from one state of matter into another. Freezing wate r to make ice, condensation of water vapor as morning dew, and sublimation (going directly from a solid to a gas) of dry ice (CO 2) are examples of phase changes. A phase change is a physical process. No chemi- cal bonds are formed or broken. Only the intermo-lecular (physical) forces are affected. Freezing is the process of changing a liquid into a solid b y removing heat. 298298 - - PHYSICAL SCIENCE n n n n n n n n n n n n n n Melting is the opposite process of freezing, whereby heat energy is added to the solid until it changes into a liquid. Boiling is the change of phase from a liquid to a gas and also requires the input of heat energy. Condensation is the change from gas to liquid, which often involves removing heat. S ome substances sub limate, which means that they change directly from the solid phase to the gas phase, without forming a liquid rst. Carbon dioxide is such a substance. Solid carbon dioxide, called dry ice, evaporates into the gas phase when heated. When gas changes directly into a solid, the process is called deposition. One example of this is snow formation, which is water vapor in the air turning directly into a solid as ice, also known as snowflakes. All of these transitions of matter generally inv olve the addition or removal of heat. This under - standing also helps with dening the physical and che mical properties of matter. Physical and Chemical Properties The physical properties of matter include properties that are observable and measurable without having to alter the chemical structure of a substance. We've already discussed a few of these previously, like mass and density, but there are many more. Some physical properties of matter include: Mass: a measure of how much matter is in an object, often measured in grams or kilograms Density: mass per unit of volume (how tightly packed the molecules are) Volume: how much space is occupied by a sub - stanc e, measured in liters or milliliters Elasticity: the ability of a substance to return to its o riginal shape after a deforming (e.g., stretch- ing) force is applied Solubility: the amount of a substance that will dissol ve in another substance (often described in terms of solubility in water); measured in grams per liter or moles per liter Boiling point: the temperature at which a sub - stanc e will boil Hardness: the measure of how resistant a sub-stanc e is to shape change when a force is applied (example: resistance to stretching) Viscosity: the measure of a substance's resistance t o flow (example: honey is highly viscous, which is why it is difcult to get out of a jar, while olive oil has low viscosity and is easy to pour) Chemical properties of matter include properties that cannot be observed; the substance's internal chemical structure must be affected for its chemical properties to be investigated. Some examples of chemical properties of matter include: Heat of combustion: the energy released when a c ompound undergoes combustion with oxygen; may be expressed as energy/mole of fuel (kJ/mol) Reactivity: the rate at which a chemical substance tends to undergo a chemical reaction Flammabilit y: the measure of how easily a sub - stance burns or combusts With all of these bits and pieces about matter and the var ious descriptions of matter, let's look at some sam- ple questions that focus on matter. Practice 1. Which of the following would NOT be consid- ered a physical property? a. flammability b. hardness c. solubilty d. density 299299 - - PHYSICAL SCIENCE 2. The smallest unit of matter is the a. compound. b. atom. c. molecule. d. proton. 3. W hich is an example of a phase change? a. oil floating on water b. oxygen diffusing in water c. paper burning d. water freezing chemical Reactions Chemical reactions happen around you (and inside you) every day. Removing stains from clothes, digest-ing food, and burning wood in a replace are all examples of chemical reactions. These types of reac- tions involve changes in the chemical arrangement of the at oms of a molecule and often show or involve the chemical properties of an element. In a chemical reaction, the atoms of reactants combine, recombine, or dissociate to form new products. Some of the rules of matter do remain the same. Ev en as the atoms interact, the number of them in a particular element remains the same after a chemical reaction as before. The total mass is also preserved. Similarly, energy is never created or destroyed by a chemical reaction. If chemical bonds are broken, energy from those bonds can be liberated into the surroundings as heat. However, this liberation of energy does not constitute creation, since the energy only changes form\u2014from chemical energy to heat energy. Knowing these things about chemical reactions wil l help with answering questions regarding chemi- cal equations, which is how these reactions are often descr ibed. Chemical Equations A chemical reaction can be represented by a chemical equation, where the reactants are written on the left side and the products on the right side of an arrow, which indicates the direction in which the reaction proceeds. Let's look at an example. The following chemi- cal equation represents the reaction of glucose (C6H12O6) with oxygen (O2) to form carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). This reaction occurs con- stantly in your body as glucose and oxygen in the blood recombine to obtain energy. (C6H12O6) + 6 (O2) q 6 (CO2) + 6 (H2O) The numbers in front of the molecular formulas indi-cate the proportion in which the molecules react. No numb er in front of the chemical formula means that one molecule of that substance is reacting. In the pre-vious reaction, one molecule of glucose is reacting with six molecules of oxygen to form six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water. The number of molecules of each of the sub- stances in the reaction tells you in what proportion the mole cules react. So if ten molecules of glucose react with 60 molecules of oxygen, you would obtain 60 molecules of carbon dioxide and 60 molecules of water. 10 (C6H12O6) + 60 (O2) q 60 (CO2) + 60 (H2O) In many ways, chemical equations are like food recipes. 2 bread + 1 cheese + 2 tomato = sandwich With two slices of bread, one slice of cheese, and two slices of tomato, you can make one sandwich. If you had six slices of bread, three slices of cheese, and six slices of tomato, you could make three sandwiches. The same principles of proportion apply in chemical reactions. 300300 - - PHYSICAL SCIENCE n n n You'll be able to answer many chemical reaction questions if you think about the proportions of the chemical formulas. Types of Chemical Reactions Similar reactions can be classied and categorized into specic types of reactions. For example, chemi-cal reactions can be classied as synthesis r eactions, decomposition reactions, single-replacement reac- tions, and doub le-replacement reactions. Each of these reactions proceeds as you may expect by its name. Synthesis reaction: two elements merging together to become a new product: A + B q AB Decomposition reaction: a single element splitting into its component parts: AB q A + B Single-replacement reaction: two elements in which a single part moves between one element and the other: C + AB q CB + A Double-replacement reaction: two elements in which two parts flip places: AB + CD q AD + CB You may encounter some of these reactions, but just ke ep in mind that the description ts what is happen- ing in the reaction. What you're more likely to run into ar e chemical equations that need to be balanced. Balancing Chemical Equations Just as in the sandwich equation previously described, the reactants will always combine in specic ratios to form the product. If two slices of bread are on the left side of the equation, then the sandwich formed on the right side will always have two slices, never one or three. If four slices are on the left side, then you will end up with four slices on the right. Look at the following synthesis reaction: N2 + 3H2 q 2NH3 (+ heat) T here are two nitrogen atoms on both sides of the eq uation. Also, there are six hydrogen atoms on each side of the equation. Matter is conserved. Now look at this synthesis reaction involving ions: 2F- + Ca2+ q CaF2 In addition to showing the conservation of matter, this example shows the conservation of charge. The two fluoride ions, each with a charge of -1, combine with a calcium ion, which has a charge of +2. The product formed is neutral; the two -1 charges and the one +2 charge cancel each other out, so charge is conserved. In fact, all chemical reactions must conserve: matter (mass) energy electric charge W ith this in mind, you'll be able to see if an equation balances on both sides or if something is wrong in a question. Heat of Reaction (Enthalpy) The heat of a reaction (enthalpy) is absolutely related to the type of chemical reaction happening. As chem-ical reactions involve the breaking of molecular bo nds, they require the input of energy to break those bonds. Similarly, the formation of new bonds releases energy. The stronger the bonds, the more energy is released when they are formed, and the more energy is required to break them. Therefore, a chemical reac-tion will either absorb or give off heat, depending on how many and what kind of bonds are broken and made as a result of that reaction. 301301 - - PHYSICAL SCIENCE These two types of reactions have names. A reaction that absorbs energy is called endothermic. A container in which an endothermic reaction takes place gets cold because the heat of the container is absorbed by the reaction. A reaction that gives off energy is called exothermic. Burning glucose (C6H12O6) is a reaction that is exothermic\u2014it gives off energy. Combustion of glucose is exothermic because the energy released by forming the C-O and O-H bonds in CO 2 and H2O is greater than the energy required to break the chemical bonds in glu-cose. It's useful to remember that exo- means giving off heat, while endo- means absorbing. Catalysts Often, a reaction needs help getting started. Such help can come from a catalyst. A catalyst is a substance that accelerates a reaction, without itself being changed or used up in the reaction. It acts by lower - ing what is called the acti vation energy of a reaction. This activation energy is often illustrated as a hill sep-arating two valleys, as in the gure here. This hill nee ds to be crossed in order to get from one valley to the other (one valley representing the reactants, and the other the products). The catalyst acts by making the hill lower and easier to cross. Products Activation Energy Reactants How a Catalyst W orks to Activate a Reaction Being able to read a diagram like this one will be use - ful to you in answering questions. The line that is dra wn between the level of the reactants and the top of the activation energy shows how much energy is needed to create the products that appear on the right side. Compounds and Mixtures There are more ways to look at elements and how they interact. When two or more elements combine chemically, the result is a compound. Examples of compounds include carbon dioxide (a product of res-piration), sucrose (table sugar), serotonin (a human br ain chemical), and acetic acid (a component of vin- egar). In each of these compounds, there is more than one type of atom chemically bonded to other atoms in a denite proportion. The combination of these atoms also results in a xed, denite structure. Com-pounds are chemically bonded. When two or more elements combine physi- cally, the result is a mixture . In a homogeneous mix- ture, the components can't be visually separated. Ho mogeneous mixtures also have the same composi- tion (ratio of components) throughout their volume. An example is a mixture of a small amount of salt mixed in water. A uniform mixture is often called a solution. In a solution, one substance (solute) is dis-solved in another (solvent). In the salt and water mix-ture, the salt is the solute, and the water is the solvent. In a heterogeneous mixture, the components can o ften be visually identied, and the composition may vary from one point of the mixture to another. A collection of dimes and pennies is a heterogeneous mixture. A mixture of sugar and flour is also hetero-geneous since sugar has a very different texture than flour. Satur ation is r eached when the solution can hold no additional solute. If additional substance continues to be added after saturation has been reached, it will not dissolve (it will either float or sink to the bottom). 302302 - - 1 mg/L = appr 303303 PHYSICAL SCIENCE Practice 4.

Warmer water holds less oxygen. d. If you double the temperature of the water, the amount of dissolved oxygen is decreased by half. energy In science, energy is dened as the ability to do work. Similarly to matter and heat in chemical reactions, energy can't be created or destroyed. This is a prop- erty called conservation of energy . Also, energy can only change form, which is a property called trans- formation of energy . This property is important in considering the forms of energy. Forms of Energy Forms of energy include potential energy and kinetic energy. Potential energy is energy that is stored. Kinetic energy is the energy associated with motion. To understand the difference, look at the following illustration. Maximum Potential Energy Maximum Potential Energy Maximum Kinetic Energy As the pendulum swings, the energy is converted from potential to kinetic and back to potential. When the hanging weight is at one of the high points, the gravitational potential energy is at a maximum and kinetic energy is at the minimum. At the low point, the kinetic energy is maximized and gravitational potential energy is minimized. Examples of potential energy include nuclear energy and chemical energy, where energy is stored in the bonds that hold atoms and molecules together. Heat, hydrodynamic energy, and electromagnetic waves are examples of kinetic energy, where energy is associated with the movement of molecules, water, and electrons or photons (particles of light). n n n n n n n - - PHYSICAL SCIENCE Heat Energy Heat as energy moves through various forms of mat-ter. It's transferred three ways: by conduction, con-vection, and radiation. Conduction is the transfer of heat from one molecule to another through a substance. Not all substances conduct heat at the same speed. Metals are good conductors. Think of how quickly a metal spoon heats up in a cup of coffee or a pot of boiling water. One end starts out cold, the other end is in heat, and the metal spoon eventually warms consis-tently throughout. Wood, paper, and air are poor heat co nductors and are considered insulators. You can stir a pot of boiling soup with a wooden spoon, and the spoon will not get hot. Another way that heat moves through matter is throug h convection, which is the transfer of heat from one place to another by the movement of fluids. When substances are heated, density is reduced. This causes the movement of the fluids (e.g., liquids or gases). For example, when a solution is heated on a stove, the heated water rises (as it becomes less dense) and the more dense liquids sink to the bottom. That movement of heat is the process of convection. The third way that heat moves is through radia - tion, which is the transfer of energy via one form of ele ctromagnetic waves. This includes the feeling of heat on your face from the sun or from a re. Electro-magnetic waves are one part of energy waves. Energy Waves Energy in all its forms can interact with matter. For example, when heat energy interacts with molecules of water, it makes them move faster and boil. Waves\u2014 including sound and seismic waves, waves on water, and light waves\u2014have energy and can transfer that energy when they interact with matter. Consider what happens if you are standing by the ocean and a big wave rolls in. Sometimes the energy carried by the wave is large enough to knock you down. Energy is also carried by electromagnetic waves or light waves. The energy of electromagnetic waves is related to their wavelengths. These electromagnetic waves include: radio waves (the longest wavelength) microwaves infrared radiation (radiant heat) visible light ultraviolet radiation X-rays gamma rays T he wavelength of the energy waves depends on the amount o f energy the wave is carrying. Shorter wave- lengths carry more energy than longer wavelengths. Whe n a wave hits a smooth surface, such as a mirror, it is reflected. In the case of sound waves, those reflec-tions come across as echoes. Matter not only can reflect waves; it can also re fract or bend waves. This is what happens when a ray of light traveling through air hits a water surface. A part of the wave is reflected, and a part is refracted into the water. Wavelengths can be used to identify elements as we ll. Each kind of atom or molecule can gain or lose energy only in particular discrete amounts. When an atom gains energy, light at the wavelength associated with that energy is absorbed. When an atom loses energy, light at the wavelength associated with that energy is emitted. Measuring whether these wave-lengths are there or not describes what element is inv olved. Parts of Waves While considering waves and energy, let's look at the four parts that make up a wave: 1. wavelength 2. amplitude 304304 - - PHYSICAL SCIENCE 3. crest 4. trough Crest Amplitude Trough Wavelength Parts of a Wa ve 6 Low Fr equency 4 2 0.0 e-2 Amplitud-4 -6 6 4 High Fr equency 2 0.0 -2 -4 -6 Practice 6. The frequency of the sounds produced by a bottle-nose d dolphin ranges from 20 Hz to 150 kHz. The lower-frequency vocalizations are likely used in social communication. Higher-frequency clicks (40 kHz to 150 kHz) are pri-marily used for echolocation. The sound waves tr avel through water at speeds of approxi- mately 1,400 m/s. The crest is the highest part of the wave, while the trough is the lowest part. The wavelength is the total distance from trough to trough or crest to crest, and amplitude is measured as the height of the wave above neutral. This applies to all types of waves (sound waves as well as ocean waves). In sound waves, the amplitude is equal to the loudness of the sound. Frequency as it relates to waves is dened as the number of wave cycles that pass in a certain period of time. In sound waves, higher-pitched sounds have a higher frequency. This means that more cycles of waves are compressed into the same period of time. Lower-pitched sounds have lower frequency. Frequency Determine the wavelengths of the waves at the lower end of the frequency range used for echolocation. Speed = wavelength \u00d7 frequency. a. 35 mm b. 1,365 m c. 0.029 m d. 56 km 305305 n n - - PHYSICAL SCIENCE Force, Motion, and Work Energy, which is associated with chemical reactions, also appears in the physical world in familiar ways. A force is a push or a pull. Objects move in response to forces acting on them. When you kick a ball, it rolls. A force is also required to stop motion, and in all this, energy is needed to make force happen. It's useful to think about sequential details involved in this action. 1. First your body breaks the chemical bonds in the fo od you have eaten. 2. This supplies your body with energy. 3. You use up some of that energy to kick the ball. 4. You apply a force, and as a result the ball mov es, carrying the energy your foot supplied it with. 5. Some of the energy is transferred from the ball to the g round in the form of heat, due to the frictional force the ball encounters on the sur - face of the ground. 6. As energy is lost this way, the ball slows down. 7. When all of the energy is used up through fric-tion, the ball stops moving. This example illustrates the concept of conservation of energy, as well as Newton's rst law\u2014the Law of Inertia\u2014which is the tendency of an object to remain either at rest or in motion with constant velocity unless acted on by a force. If you were to hit a ball and there was no force working against it (in this case it would be friction), it would continue to move forever. Measuring Force Speed, velocity, acceleration, and momentum are all ways or aspects of measuring force. These concepts are used frequently in daily life, but it's a good idea to understand the exact scientic meanings for the GED\u00ae Science test. For example, what is the difference between spe ed and velocity? A speed , such as 30 miles per hour, has magnitude. A velocity has magnitude and direction (e.g., 30 miles per hour north) A similar distinction can be made between the terms distance and displac ement. If you walk 20 feet to your mailbox and 20 feet back, the distance you trav- eled is 40 feet. Your displace ment is zero, because dis- placement compares your ending point to your start ing point. While velocity has magnitude and direction, it can also be dened as displacement divided by elapsed time. In contrast, acceleration is velocity divided by elapsed time. Additionally, an acceleration that is negative (due to an ending velocity that is less than the starting velocity) is called a deceleration . But, for velocity to change, the speed and/or the direction must change and a net or unbalanced force must be applied. All of these aspects are measurements of force, and these ideas are all needed to understand how force may work in a particular situation, experiment, or question. Often questions on the GED\u00ae Science test will be specically associated with these ideas, so being able to gure out what the question is asking may require you to understand these terms. When looking at all of these concepts in relation to an object, let's summarize a bit: an object at rest (whose speed is zero) remains at rest unless some force acts on it (e.g., a person pushes it, the wind blows it away, or gravity pulls it down). An object that is moving continues to move at the same speed in the same direction, unless some force is applied to it to slow it down, to speed it up, or to change its direc-tion. The amount of acceleration or deceleration is dire ctly proportional to the force applied. The harder 306306 - - PHYSICAL SCIENCE you kick the ball, the faster it will move. The mass of the ball will also determine how much it will acceler - ate. Kick a soccer ball and then a ball made of lead with the same force (watch your foot!). Which ball moves faster as a result of an equal kick? These obser - vations constitute Ne wton's second law\u2014the Law of Acceleration: Force = mass \u00d7 acceleration A r elated concept is momentum. If an object is in motion, it has momentum. The amount of momen - tum an object has depends on its mass and velocity. Think of a heavy cart rolling downhill fast; it has a lot of momentum (large mass and high velocity). Now think of a textbook sliding down an incline (relatively small mass and low velocity); it has much less momentum than the cart. Momentum = mass \u00d7 velocity With momentum, acceleration, velocity, distance, and speed, we can determine a lot about the force these aspects describe. Types of Forces Newton's laws specically relate to the study of how the motion of objects is affected by force. Other types of forces include gravitational, electromagnetic, and contact forces, which are discussed next. Gravitational Force G ravitation is an attractive force that each object with mass exerts on any other object with mass. The strength of the gravitational force depends on the masses of the objects and on the distance between them. When we think of gravity, we usually think of Earth 's gravity, which prevents us from jumping in- nitely high, keeps objects stuck to the ground, and makes things thrown upward fall down. We, too, exert a gravitational force on the earth, and we exert forces on one another, but these are not very noticeable because our masses are very small in comparison with the mass of our planet. The greater the masses involved, the greater the gr avitational force between them. The sun exerts a force on the earth, and the earth exerts a force on the sun. The moon exerts a force on the earth, and the earth on the moon. The gravitational force of the moon is the reason there are tides. The moon's grav-ity pulls the water on Earth. The sun also exerts a fo rce on our water, but this is not as apparent because the sun, although more massive than the moon, is very far away. As the distance between two objects doubles, the gravitational force between them decreases four times. What is the difference between weight and mass? On Earth, the acceleration due to gravity, g, is -9.8 m/s2 (meters per second squared). Your weight (w) is really a force. The formula Force = mass \u00d7 accel- eration becomes Weight = mass \u00d7 gravitational accel- eration. Since the acceleration, g, is -9.8 m/s2, the overall force (w) is negative, which just means that its pull is in the downward direction: the earth is pulling you toward its center. A fun way to think about this is that you have pr obably heard somebody say: \"You'd weigh less on the moon!\" This is true because the gravitational force on the moon is less than the earth's gravitational force. Your mass, however, would still be the same, because mass is just a measure of your density and the volume you take up. Weight is commonly measured in newtons (N), so w hen you see an N, you'll be dealing with weight and force. Fun fact: 1 N = 0.222 pounds. Electromagnetic Force Ele ctricity and magnetism are two aspects of a single ele ctromagnetic force, another type of force that you may run into. It is exactly what it sounds like, elec- tricity and magnetism. Moving electric charges pro-duce magnetic forces, and moving magnets produce ele ctric forces. The electromagnetic force exists between any two charged or magnetic objects: for example, a proton and an electron or two electrons. 307307 - - PHYSICAL SCIENCE Opposite charges attract (an electron and a proton), whereas like charges repel (two protons or two elec-trons). The strength of the force depends on the charg es and on the distance between them. The greater the charges, the greater the force. The closer the charges are to each other, the greater the force between them. Contact Forces Contact forces, yet another type of force, are those that e xist as a result of an interaction between objects physically in contact with one another. They include frictional forces, tensional forces, and normal forces. The frictional force o pposes the motion of an object across a surface. For example, if a glass slides across the surface of the dinner table, there exists a friction force in the direction opposite to the motion of the glass. Friction is the result of attractive inter - molecular forces between the molecules of the sur - face of the glass and the surface of the table. Friction de pends on the nature of the two surfaces. There would be less friction between the table and the glass if the table was highly polished. The glass would glide across the table more easily. Friction also depends on the degree to which the glass and the table are pressed together. Also, air resistance is a type of frictional force. An example of air resistance is how it affects something like a ball that has been thrown. Both gravitational and frictional force slow it and lead it to land back on the ground. Tension is the force that is transmitted through a rope or wire when it is pulled tight by forces acting at each end. The tensional force is directed along the rope or wire and pulls on the objects on either end. A kite may use air resistance to catch the wind and rise in the air, while the person holding the end of the kite's line is using tensional force to hold on to and guide the kite and pull it back to the ground. A last type of contact force is nor mal force, which is exerted on an object in contact with another stable object. For example, the dinner table exerts an upward force on a glass at rest on the surface of the table. All of these forces are used in everyday objects like simple machines, which use energy and force to do various types of work. Work and Machines Machines are built to do work, and at their most basic level, this relates to overcoming the effects of force on an object. A simple machine is a device that changes the direction or magnitude of a force. A simple machine can be dened as a mechanism that provides mechanical advantage or leverage. In other words, simple machines make it easier to do work. WORK anD POWeR Work is defined as the product of force and distance: Work = force \u00d7 distance Power is the rate at which work is done: Power = work/time Th e metric unit for power is the watt. One watt equals 1 joule/second. So power is sometimes measured in joules per second. When you see this, remember that it's power related. 308308 - - PHYSICAL SCIENCE 1 Lever 2 Wheel and Axle Weight Force Fulcrum Force Weight 3 Fixed Pulley 4 Inclined Plane Force Weight Force Weight 5 Wedge 6 Screw Force Weight Force Weight There are six basic types of simple machines: A lever produces a mechanical advantage by transfer - ring an applied force over a distance and exerting an out put force on an object (example: think of a crowbar). A wheel and axle asse mbly is formed by two disks, or cylinders, of different diameters that rotate together around the same axis. Forces applied to the edges of the two disks, or cylinders, provide mechani-cal advantage (example: think of a steering wheel in a car or a d oorknob). A xed pulley can make it easier to lift an object. Although the same amount of force is needed to lift an object with a xed single pulley as without the pulley, giving it no mechanical advantage, certain types of pulleys do produce a mechanical advantage. The more pulleys that are added to the system, the less force that is needed to move the object. The mechanical advantage is increased because the force is distributed over the length of the pulley ropes. For example: n Fixed single pulley: if you wanted to lift a 100-kg object 10 cm, you would need to apply 100 N of force. Double pulley system: if you wanted to lift a 100-kg object 10 cm, you would need to apply 50 N of force. Triple pulley system: if you wanted to lift a 100-kg object 10 cm, you would need to apply 33.3 N of force. Four-pulley system: if you wanted to lift a 100-kg object 10 cm, you would need to apply 25 N of force. n n n A n inclined plane p roduces a mechanical advantage by allowing a smaller force to be applied to increase the vertical distance of an object (for example, think of pushing a cart up a hill versus lifting it straight up). A wedge p roduces a mechanical advantage by concentrating force on a small area (for example, think of an ax splitting a log). A screw, which is an inclined plane wrapped ar ound a cylinder, produces a mechanical advantage by amplifying the force applied. A small rotational force on the shaft can exert a large force on the load (for example, think of a corkscrew). Understanding how these various simple mac hines work is useful for both the GED\u00ae Science test and daily life. A question you encounter on the test involving pulleys may include determining from a diagram how much force you would need to apply to lift 100 kg. The diagram might show a single-, double-, and triple-pulley system with all the infor - mation previously given here, and the four-pulley 309309 - - PHYSICAL SCIENCE system would not tell you how much force you would need. Since each additional pulley reduces the amount of force, this would give you a clue as to how much force you would need. When answering physi-cal science questions, take the information presented and w ork out the solution with that information and any science knowledge you have learned. Physical s cience Review 1.

A p hysical property is something that is observable and measurable and does not involve a chemical reaction. Flammability is the correct choice as it involves the ability of a sub-stance to burn, a property that cannot be deter - mined without chemically altering the s ubstance. Choices b, c, and d are each observ- able and measurable properties of substances; the refore, none of them is the correct choice. 2. b. T he smallest unit of matter is the atom. A compound is a substance made up of multiple different elements, so choice a is incorrect. A molecule can be made up of multiple atoms, so choice c is incorrect. A proton is a positively charged particle in an atom, but it is not con- sidered a unit of matter, and therefore choice d is inc orrect. 3. d. A phase change is when matter changes from a solid to a liquid, from a liquid to a gas, from a liquid to a solid, or from a gas to a liquid. Choice d is the correct answer because water freezing is a phase change from liquid to solid. Choice a is incorrect because oil floating repre- sents a difference in density, not a phase change. C hoice b is incorrect because when oxygen dif- fuses in water, it stays as a gas in the water and d oes not change phase. Choice c is not correct because there is no change in state when paper burns. This is an example of a chemical reac- tion, not a phase change. 4. b. B ecause heat is released during the reaction (and indicated by )H = -890 kj), the reaction is considered exothermic. Choice a is incorrect because a reaction that absorbs energy is called endothermic. Choice c is incorrect because it refers to balancing equations, not heat of reac- tion. Choice d is incorrect because it refers to par t of the hydrologic cycle, not heat of reaction in chemical reactions. 5. c. T he graph shows that the amount of oxygen dissolved in water decreases as water tempera- ture increases. Choice c is correct because you can c onclude that warmer water holds less oxy- gen based on the information in the graph. C hoice a is incorrect because the graph does not show the rate at which oxygen dissolves. Choice b is incorrect because the caption states that sh can live at 2 ppm and the graph indi-cates a level of more than 8 ppm at 25\u00b0C.

All of these elements combined have made Earth a very unique planet. The special conditions on Earth, including the distance from the sun, the makeup of the atmosphere, and the presence of freshwater and oceans, allow life to occur. This chapter reviews areas of earth and space science that will likely appear on the GED\u00ae Science test as parts of diagrams or passages. Elements of both physical and life sciences will appear within earth and space sci - e nce. All of these sciences are interconnected, allowing you to use ideas from one area to interpret questions fro m another. Practice exercises are included through the chapter. Use them to help with practicing applying the science knowledge presented to solve problems and questions. Answers and explanations are at the end of the chapter. Let's start close to home, with Earth's systems. 315 n n n n - - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE Earth's Systems Earth is made up of a series of systems involving the planet's atmosphere, land masses, and oceans. The interdependence of these systems is one of the most important principles involved in earth science and is the basis for how the planet supports life. Composition of the Earth Starting with Earth's composition, it is formed from a series of four main layers: inner core outer core rocky mantle crust T he inner core is a solid mass of iron with a tempera- ture of about 7,000\u00b0F. The high heat at the earth's co re is a combination of three factors: (1) residual heat from the formation of the earth, (2) frictional heating caused by denser parts of the core moving toward the center and the frictional force that creates, and (3) the decay of radioactive elements such as ura-nium in the core. The inner core is approximately 1,500 miles in diameter. To give a comparison, the widest point from the East Coast to the West Coast of the United States is more than twice that at 3,400 miles. This inner core is also, as you may guess from its name, the absolute center of the planet. The outer core is the next layer out from the inner core and is a mass of molten iron surrounding the inner core. Electrical currents generated from this area produce the earth's magnetic eld. The magnetic eld assigns the North and South Poles and protects the earth from the charged particles of solar winds and cosmic rays. The rocky mantle, the next layer, is composed o f silicon, oxygen, magnesium, iron, aluminum, and calcium and is about 1,750 miles thick. This mantle accounts for most of the earth's mass. When parts of this layer become hot enough, they turn to slow-moving molten rock or magma. This is what comes out of volcanoes when they erupt; however, volcanoes are on the next layer. Earth's crust is the outermost non-gaseous layer of the planet. It is from 4 to 25 miles thick and consists of sand and rock. This is the part of the planet that we live on and that is most familiar to us. Since it is called the crust, you could think of it like a pizza or bread crust\u2014the outermost part of a pizza or a loaf of bread. The following is a diagram of the layers of the planet. You may encounter a question where the lay- ers are not labeled and you are asked to label these parts. One helpful thing about science is that the naming of things usually follows some form of logic. The name of each part of the planet tells you where it is located. 316316 - - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE Crust Mantle Outer Core Inner core (size exaggerated) Magma rises from the mantle through the crust and erupts Volcano out the volcano. Next, let's look at the absolute outermost layer of Earth, the atmosphere. Practice 1. Compared to the earth's crust, the inner core is hotte r and contains a. more molten iron. b. more solid iron. c. most of Earth's mass. d. mostly sand and rock. Atmosphere and Water The atmosphere is a thin layer of gases surrounding the earth. Our atmosphere contains about 78% nitro-gen, 21% oxygen, 1% water vapor, and a small amount of other gases. These gases combine to abso rb ultraviolet radiation from the sun and warm the planet's surface through heat retention. The atmosphere is divided into four layers: 1. troposphere\u2014closest to the earth; up to about 6 miles abo ve. This is the part that we live in and birds fly in. 2. stratosphere\u2014second layer, from about 6 to 30 miles abo ve the earth. The lowest part of the stratosphere is as high as planes will fly. 3. mesosphere\u2014third layer, from about 30 to 50 miles abo ve the earth 4. thermosphere\u2014fourth layer, from about 50 to 300 miles abo ve Earth 317317 - - 318EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE 318 When you think of atmosphere, it's easy to assume it's mostly water and oxygen; however, our atmosphere is more nitrogen than oxygen, and it can't hold a lot of water. But living beings need water for both the out- side and the inside of their cells. In fact, vertebrates (you included) are about 70% water. Water moves through the atmosphere in a cyclical way. At its sim- plest, sunlight evaporates the water from the oceans, rivers, and lakes. The evaporated water then con- denses to form clouds that produce rain or snow onto the earth's surface (precipitation). This cycle is sometimes called the water or hydrologic cycle and is critical to sustaining life on Earth. The diagram that follows shows elements of this cycle and is an exam- ple of the kind of diagram you might see on the GED\u00ae test if you were asked a question about the hydrologic cycle. Ocean Saltwater Freshwater-Saltwater Interface Groundwater Water Table PrecipitationClouds Forming Evaporation Precipitation Evaporation River SystemRiver System Lake Surface Runoff Water or Hydrologic Cycle Carbon Cycle Another system of Earth is the carbon cycle. These systems are characterized by complex patterns of interconnectedness, which are often cyclical in nature. The carbon cycle is one of the most important exam- ples of this. Carbon is found in the oceans in the form of bicarbonate ions (HCO- 3 ); in the atmosphere, in the form of carbon dioxide; in living organisms; and in fossil fuels (such as coal, oil, and natural gas). The bicarbonate ions in the ocean settle to the bottom and form sedimentary rocks, while plants remove the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and convert it to sugars through photosynthesis. The sugar in plants enters the food chain, rst reaching herbivores, then carnivores and omnivores, and nally scavengers and decomposers. All of these organisms release carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere when they breathe. Carbon Cycle Numbers in black indicate storage of carbon in gigatons(GtC), and numbers in gray alongside arrows indicate annual exchange of carbon (GtC/yr). Source: Wikimedia Commons. Fossil fuels, the last of this list of sources of carbon, represent the largest reserve of carbon on Earth. Fos- sil fuels come from the carbon of organisms that lived millions of years ago. Burning fossil fuels releases energy, which is why these fuels are used to power - - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE machines. When fossil fuels burn, carbon is released into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide (which then is used by the plants, and the cycle con-tinues). However, since the Industrial Revolution, whe n the consumption of energy began to increase substantially to power machinery, people have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by 30% by burning fossil fuels and cut-ting down forests that would otherwise assist in re ducing the higher concentration of carbon dioxide. Burning fossil fuels and forests also releases nitr ogen, and all forms of xed nitrogen are among the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. In addition, nitric oxide, another gas released when fos-sil fuels are burned, can convert into nitric acid. This is a main component of acid rain, which destroys habitats. This information is important when consid-ering the health of the planet and the humans and creat ures living on it. People are already suffering the consequences of the pollution they have caused. The focus on preventing further damage to the ecosys-tems and xing the damage that has been done is another c hallenge for today's scientists. With all of these cycles and systems, another part of the earth's composition is the plates in the upper part of the rocky mantle. Practice 2. What is the role of the ocean in the carbon cyc le? a. The ocean absorbs carbon from the atmosp here. b. The ocean produces carbon dioxide. c. The ocean currents transfer heat. d. Water evaporates from the ocean surface. Plate Tectonics While the earth's upper mantle is rigid and is part of the lithosphere (together with the crust), the lower mantle flows slowly, at a rate of a few centimeters per year. The crust is divided into plates that drift slowly (only a few centimeters each year) on the less rigid mantle. T his motion of the plates is caused by con- vection (heat) currents, which carry heat from the hot inne r mantle to the cooler outer mantle. This process is called plate tectonics. This motion also results in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Evidence suggests that about 200 million years ago , all continents were a part of one landmass, named Pangaea. Over the years, the continents slowly separated in a process called continental drift. Oce - anic crust is thinner than continental crust, but still affe cts continental drift. The theory of plate tectonics says that there are now 15 large plates that t together like a puzzle and yet continue to slowly move on the mantle. Tectonic plates can slide past each other, sepa- rate from each other (diverge ), o r come together (converge ). The force needed to move billions of tons of rock is unimaginable, and when plates move, some of that energy is released as earthquakes. Faults, or places where the tectonic plates meet, exist all over the world and are often the sites of strong earth-quakes. An example of plates sliding past each other is the San Andreas fault in California. Converging plates often result in the creation of mountains. F or example, the Andes Mountains were formed by the Nazca Plate being pushed under the South American Plate. When two oceanic plates meet each other, this often results in the formation of an island arc system. When two plates separate, or diverge, energy is released, earthquakes occur, and magma is released. The Atlantic Ocean was formed by the separation of plates over millions of years. At some plate boundaries, one plate slides under the othe r (subduction). As the plate slides under the other, the crust melts as it goes deeper into the earth. This creates magma, which rises to the surface and can form volcanoes. Another spot where molten material breaks through to the surface from inside the earth is through the floor of the ocean. It flows from ssures, where it is cooled by the water, result ing 319319 - - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE in the formation of igneous rocks. As the molten material flows from a ssure, it also forms ridges adjacent to it. One large version of this ridge forma-tion is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is where the Eur asian and North American Plates diverge. These plates have created the areas where the oc eans are contained and also affect the way the oceans behave as a system. Ocean Currents Oceanic currents, measured in meters per second or in knots (1 knot = 1.15 miles per hour or 1.85 kilo-meters per hour), are driven by several factors. One is the r ise and fall of the tides, which are affected by the gravitational force of the moon. A second factor that drives ocean currents is wind, which is caused by many things, from high- and low-pressure systems to the rotation of the earth. A third factor that drives currents is density differences in water due to tem-perature and salinity in different parts of the ocean. The reasons that ocean currents are so impor - tant among the systems of Earth is that they can impac t weather globally and locally. For example, the Gulf Stream is an ocean current that runs from the tip of Florida, flowing along the eastern coastline of the United States and to Newfoundland before cross-ing the Atlantic Ocean. Because it carries warm water, it mak es northern Europe warmer than it would be otherwise. Another example you may have heard of is the weathe r phenomenon called El Ni\u00f1o. El Ni\u00f1o is a band of very warm ocean water that develops off the western coast of South America and can cause cli-matic changes. Typically, El Ni\u00f1o happens every two to seven years and lasts nine months to two years. Because El Ni\u00f1o's warm waters feed thunderstorms, it creates increased rainfall across the eastern Pacic Ocean. Along the west coast of South America, El Ni\u00f1o reduces the upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water that sustains large sh populations. This reduc-tion in upwelling has led to lower sh populations off the shore of Peru. The impact of El Ni\u00f1o, as a weather phe nomenon caused by ocean currents, can be felt across the globe. With the tropical thunderstorms fueled by the hot, humid air over the oceans, the atmosphere produces patterns of high and low pres-sure in response. This can result in higher tempera-tures in western Canada and the upper plains of the Unit ed States and colder temperatures in the south- ern United States. Additionally, in contrast to the floo ding rains experienced in South America, the eastern coast of Africa can experience severe drought during an El Ni\u00f1o event. All this is caused by a band of very warm ocean water. Natural Hazards While the earth's systems interact in a way that cre - ates an environment most benecial to sustaining li fe, these systems also can lead to natural hazards. Floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, and droughts are all examples of natural hazards, and all of these conditions produce stresses on the environment. Floods can e rode the topsoil; destroy trees, grass, and crops; and even tear down homes. Floods can also contribute to the spread of disease by dam-aging sewage and waste disposal mechanisms. The res ults of a flood can take years to undo. Earthquakes can t ear up the land and produce rockslides. They can even cause flooding if a river is redirected. The effects of an earthquake in a big city can be devastating. Hurricanes are also known as tropical cyclones. A tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system with a low-pressure center, strong winds, and a spi - ral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce he avy rain. They form over large bodies of relatively warm water. Hurricanes can wreak havoc along the coasts, destroying plants, trees, buildings, and even highways. Tsunamis are very large, destructive water waves that are caused by earthquakes, volcanic erup- 320320 - - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE tions, or landslides (not wind). They used to be called tidal waves because they resembled a rising tide, but tsunamis have nothing to do with tides. Drought occurs when an area receives substan- t ially less precipitation than normal. Droughts can be desig nated after 15 days with reduced rainfall. Signi- cant and sustained droughts can impact crops and liv estock and result in widespread food shortage, malnutrition, and famine. All of these natural hazards are a part of the cyc les of Earth, but they aren't pleasant and they cause damage to habitats and ecosystems. Practice 3. Earthquakes are caused by a. tsunamis. b. global warming. c. plate tectonics. d. ocean currents. natural r esources and Energy While nature may have some major hazards, it also is full of resources that humans depend on to sus - tain life. A good part of the resources we use every da y come directly from the environment. These are called natural resources\u2014resources provided by nature. Resources Air, water, sunlight, topsoil, plants, and animals are examples of Earth's natural resources. This huge vari-ety of plant and animal life is referred to as biodi ver- sity. The effects of human activity on biodiversity are a g rowing concern of environmental activists and sci- entists, as habitat destruction has reduced the diver - sity of life forms in many regions throughout the wo rld. There are two kinds of natural resources: renew- able and nonrenewable. Renewable resources are resources that can be replaced or replenished over a short period of time. Plants and crops are examples of resources that, with proper agriculture, are replenishable. Nonrenewable resources are resources that cannot be replaced or that take many years to replen-ish. Fossil fuels such as oil and coal are examples of nonr enewable resources, as they are formed from organisms that lived millions of years ago. Oceans Oceans are a major renewable resource, and even if you live hundreds of miles from the shore, you are still dependent on the ocean. We rely on the ocean for food, jobs, energy, and recreation. At the same time, oceans cover 70% of Earth's surface and contain more than 97% of all water on Earth. About half of the world's population lives near the ocean, and ocean-based businesses contribute more than $500 billion to the world's economy. In fact, there are more than 140 million jobs in shing, aquaculture, and other related activities. The ocean contains important min-eral and energy resources such as oil and gas, and shipping accounts for the transport of 90% of the world's international traded goods. In addition to their economic importance, the oceans contain rich biodiversity. Coral reefs and estuaries (salty or brack-ish freshwater that runs into the ocean) sustain 75% of all commercial sh and shellsh during some point of their life cycles, and one in six people on Earth depend on ocean sh as their primary source of protein. Even with all of this, global climate change is hav ing signicant negative effects on our oceans. The oceans absorb about one-fourth of the CO2 emitted from human activities. This is called a carbon sink. The oceans contain 500 times more carbon than the atmosphere. When CO 2 is absorbed by the ocean, it interacts with saltwater to form carbonic acid. As the levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere continue to increase, the levels of carbonic acid in the ocean also increase. 321321 - - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE This rising acidication of the ocean ends up causing harm to plankton, adversely affecting shellsh larvae, hindering the ability of corals to build new reefs, and causing serious food chain disruptions. Another result of warmer global temperatures is that the ice sheets in the Arctic are melting. This melt- ing is having negative consequences for many species of marine mammals that live there. With the usually frigid ocean water warming, the results are increased marine diseases and invasive species, changes in weather systems, and the death of coral reefs. This causes larger and more frequent storms that are accel-erating shoreline erosion and affecting how the oc eans interact with the land. Along with this, sea lev- els rising will end up causing habitat loss, and people wil l need to be relocated as their island and coastal homelands are eliminated. So while the ocean is a huge resource, climate chang e is altering our relationship to it and the way it acts as a resource. Energy Energy as a resource of the earth comes in many vari-eties. Each type of energy is transferred between the earth 's surface and the atmosphere via conduction, convection, and radiation. Radiation specically comes from the sun and passes through the atmo-sphere; some is reflected back into space while some is absor bed by clouds or the earth's surface. Solar Power Ultimately our energy comes from the sun. The sun's ene rgy reaches our planet in the form of light radia- tion. Plants use this light to synthesize sugar mole-cules, which are consumed when the plants are eaten by animals or humans. We obtain energy from the sugar molecules, and our bodies use it. The sun also drives the earth's geochemical cycles. Along with generally heating the planet, the sun heats the earth's surface and drives convection within the atmosphere and oceans, producing winds and ocean currents. The winds cause waves on the sur - faces of oceans and lakes and transfer some of their ene rgy to the water through friction between the air molecules and the water molecules. Solar power also refers to the conversion of solar e nergy to another, more useful form. Sunlight can be harnessed and collected in special green-houses, and photovoltaic cells can produce electricity whe n sunlight hits them. The energy that strikes the earth's surface from the sun in one hour is nearly as much energy as is used by all of humanity in one year. Considering this, many scientists are convinced that this form of energy will one day replace ordinary fos-sil fuels. This all sounds pretty great, but solar-powered cars and houses are not that common yet. One reason is because fossil fuels are cheaper to collect and use. But the solar technology is catching up\u2014solar plants are now being constructed, and in 2012, about 0.14% of all electricity generation was from solar power. This may seem like a small percentage of overall energy production, but it represents a 58% increase over 2011. Along with this, many people are nding employment in the solar industry. In 2012 there were more than 119,000 solar workers in the United States, a 13.2% increase over 2011. The sun provides energy and jobs to humans. It also he lps create wind, which is another big energy resource. Wind Power Wind power refers to the conversion of wind energy into a useful form of energy. Large wind farms con- sist of hundreds of individual wind turbines, which are connected to the electric power grid. These farms are established on land and offshore (in the ocean). Wind power, like solar power, acts as an alterna- tive to fossil fuels. It is plentiful, is renewable, and pr oduces no greenhouse gas emissions. Some coun- tries are far ahead of the United States in harnessing the p ower of the wind for usable energy. For example, 322322 - - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE Denmark generates more than a quarter of its elec- tricity from wind. In 2010 wind energy production was mo re than 2.5% of total worldwide electricity usage. The cost per unit of energy produced is similar to the cost for new coal and natural gas installations, but in the long term it could be less costly in terms of impact on the environment. Geothermal Power Geothermal energy, another energy resource, comes fro m the heat that is produced in the rocks and fluids beneath Earth's crust. It can be found anywhere from shallow depths to several miles below the surface, and even farther down to the extremely hot molten rock called magma. Deep wells are drilled into the under - ground reservoirs to tap steam and very hot water that dr ive turbines linked to electricity generators. This particular type of energy is also renewable sim-ply because the heat of the planet is not cooling that quic kly. Energy from Fossil Fuels Fossil fuels are a major energy resource, but they are a nonr enewable resource. This energy source includes oil and coal and is used for heat, electricity, and gaso-line. Since fossil fuels come from the remains of crea-tures that died millions of years ago, they are de creasing worldwide as we use them up. Addition- ally, burning them causes various gases to be released into the at mosphere, as stated earlier. Carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmo- sphere can trap solar energy\u2014a process known as the gr eenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect is a natu- rally occurring process that has been accelerated by human production of so-called greenhouse gases such as CO2. Increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases can cause global warming\u2014 an increase of temperatures on Earth. In the past 100 years, the temperatures have increased by 1\u00b0C. This doesn't seem like much, but the temperature increase is already creating noticeable climate changes and pr oblems, such as the melting of polar ice caps and the rising of ocean levels. Reducing carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, either by nding new energy sources or by actively removing the car - bon dioxide that forms, is a challenge for today's sci-entists. Practice 4. Which of the following is considered a nonre- newable natural resource? a. wind b. oil c. solar d. water 5.

Read the following passage and explain how human b ehavior has indirectly contributed to the destruction of coral reefs across the globe. Include multiple pieces of evidence from the text to support your answer. 323323 cOraL r EEFS in JEOpard Y Coral reefs are found around the world. They are built by marine invertebrates called coral polyps. The coral polyps that build coral reefs rely on zooxanthellae. Zooxanthellae are a form of photo - synthetic algae that live symbiotically in the tissue of corals and provide some of the corals' food su pply. For this reason, corals can thrive only in very clear water in a very specific temperature range. They rarely grow deeper than 40 m, and they prefer saltwater. The best temperature for coral reefs is between 25\u00b0C and 31\u00b0C, and the best salinity is between 34 and 37 parts per 1,000. Also, the pH of ocean water can affect coral growth. Even relatively small increases in ocean acid-ity can decrease the capacity of corals to build skeletons. Bleaching or whitening of coral reefs occurs when the corals lose their zooxanthallae and can result in the death of the corals. C oral reefs are important for ecological and economic reasons. They are some of most di verse ecosystems in the world. They occupy less than 0.1% of the world's ocean surface, yet they provide a home for 25% of all marine species. Coral reefs are often referred to as the \"rain - forests of the sea.\" Economically, they are important to fishing and tourism industries. The annual global economic value of coral reefs was more than US$350 billion in 2002. Yet, they are being destroyed around the world at alarming rates. About 10% of the world's coral reefs have already been completely destroyed. In parts of the world, the Philippines for example, over 70% of the coral reefs have been destroyed. Humans have contributed to the destruction of coral reefs both directly and indirectly. Cer - tain fishing practices such as the use of poisons and explosives harm or kill reefs directly. Indi-rectly, humans have damaged the ocean environment of the corals through warming ocean temperatur es, sedimentation, and pollution, including increasing the carbon dioxide in the atmo- sphere. Because the ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (and changes it to car - bonic acid), an increase in CO2 in the atmosphere has resulted in a decrease in oceanic pH of 0.1. This change may seem small but has had catastrophic consequences for corals and the coral ecosystem. Write your answer on the lines or on a separate sheet of paper. You should take approximately 10 minutes to complete this task. 324324 - - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE Structure of the Universe Having gone over the earth in detail, let's take a look at the universe at large. Nobody knows for sure how the universe originated, but a major theory is the Big Bang theory. This theory states that the universe started off in a hot, dense state under high pressure between 10 billion and 20 billion years ago, then expanded rapidly, and has been expanding ever since. The universe is still expanding and cooling. Some data suggest that the rate of expansion of the universe is increasing. Whether the universe will continue to expand forever and eventually reach an equilibrium size or shrink back into a small, dense, hot mass is unknown at this point, but it's a mystery that scien-tists are still looking into. Stars and Galaxies Some of the most common objects in the universe are stars. Stars are formed by the gravitational attraction of countless hydrogen and helium molecules. The energy of stars stems from nuclear reactions, mainly the fusion of hydrogen atoms to form helium. These nuclear processes in stars lead to the formation of ele-ments, and the stars become gravitationally bound to other stars, forming galaxies, another major part of the universe. A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar dust, and dark matter. It is bound together by gravity, and black holes exist in the center of many them. There are bil-lions of galaxies in the known universe (some say ov er 170 billion!). Our solar system is part of the Milky Way galaxy, which in addition to the sun con-tains about 200 billion other stars. When considering the universe, we have a par - ticular perspective on what is out there based on what we can see from Earth. Constellations are a big part of that. Constellations If you have seen the Big Dipper in the night sky, then you have seen a constellation, which is a pattern or grouping of stars. Because of the rotation of the earth, certain constellations are visible only at certain times of the year. The reason we even have constellations at all is that organizing these stars into some kind of conguration that looks like something familiar has helped people to remember which stars are which. Also, for centuries people have looked to skies to nav-igate the seas, to know when to have religious cere-monies, and to know when to plant and reap their cro ps. All of these things were aided by humans look- ing into the sky and using the stars to guide their way. Planets Earth is a planet, but not all planets are like Earth. A planet is now dened as a celestial body that has enough mass to be spherical, orbits a star, and is not part of a belt (such as an asteroid belt). In our imme-diate neighborhood, these planets are situated in our solar syst em. Solar Systems Our solar system is made up of the sun and all of the objects that orbit around it, including the planets, moons, asteroids, and comets. The sun is very mas-sive, and it has a strong gravitational that pulls on the ob jects in the solar system. There are eight planets in our solar system. In order (closest to farthest from the sun), they are Mer - cury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Ne ptune. The rst four planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) are called terrestrial planets because they are rocky. The other planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) are called gas giants because they are made up mainly of gas. You may have learned that Pluto was one of nine planets in our solar sy stem. In the 1990s, astron- omers discovered that Pluto was not a planet in its 325325 - - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE own orbit but part of a belt of asteroids. This asteroid belt also included several other small planet-like bod-ies that were around the same size as Pluto. Because of this, in 2006 astronomers voted to change Pluto's designation to that of a dwarf planet. We now recog-nize only eight true planets. Mercury Earth Jupiter Venus Sun Mars Saturn Uranus Neptune Planets of the Solar System Compar ed with each other, the sizes are correct but the distances are not. A comet is a small, icy celestial body that, when pass - ing close to the sun, may display a tail. The tail is caused by solar radiation and the solar wind. Comets range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilome-ters across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small, rocky particles. Comets have orbits that range from a few years to several hundred years. Halley's comet, for example, is visible from Earth about every 75 years. Its next appearance should be in 2061. There are over 4,000 known com-ets, and most are not bright enough to be seen by the nake d eye. A very few are extraordinarily bright and are considered \"great comets.\" The Hale-Bopp comet and Halley's comet are examples of great comets. Some other objects typical of the solar system are asteroids. Asteroids are similar to comets but dif- fer in composition. They're made up of metals and ro cky materials and have no tail (because they are not composed of ice). There are millions of asteroids, some of which are as small as particles of dust, while others are as large as half a mile in diameter. Most of the known asteroids orbit in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Astronomers estimate that this belt contains between 1.1 million and 1.9 million asteroids larger than 1 km (0.6 mi) in diame-ter and millions of smaller ones. Our solar system is full of a variety of celestial bo dies, some of which are occasionally visible in our night sky, and all of which, through studying them, help us learn more about our universe and our planet. Development of Stars Understanding how stars are formed helps us to understand how our own sun and solar system were created. Scientists now know that the formation of stars occurs within what are called \"stellar nurseries,\" which are a type of nebula. A nebula is a cloud of dust and gas, composed primarily of hydrogen (97%) and helium (3%). Nebulae may be giant, with 1,000 to 100,000 times the mass of the sun, or smaller, with less than a few hundred times the mass of the sun. Also, there are areas within a nebula where gravity causes the dust and gas to clump together. As the clump gains mass, its gravitational attraction increases, which in turn draws more mass to it. This clump is called a protostar at this stage and is the beginning of a star forming. The protostar keeps drawing in more gas and gr owing even hotter. Once the protostar gets hot enough, its hydrogen atoms start fusing. If the proto-star gathers enough mass, the young star blasts the remaining gas and dust away, stabilizes, and becomes a main sequence star. After a star has formed, it gen-erates thermal energy in its core through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium. This process of stellar (star) development can take millions of years. A star the size of our sun takes about 50 million years to mature to adulthood. Our sun will stay in the mature phase for approximately 10 billion years. The lifespan of a star is determined by the type of star it is. In some stars, when the core runs out of hydrogen fuel, it contracts under the weight of grav-ity and heats up. The core's rising temperature heats the up per layers, causing them to expand. As this happens, the radius of the star increases and it becomes a red giant. When the helium fuel runs out entirely, the core expands and cools and the upper layers expand and eject material that collect around 326326 - - 327327 EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE the dying star to form a planetary nebula. Finally, the core cools into a white dwarf and then eventually into a black dwarf. This entire process takes a few bil- lion years. In other (more massive) stars, when the core runs out of hydrogen, the stars fuse helium into car- bon just like the sun. However, after the helium is gone, their mass is enough to fuse carbon into heavier elements such as oxygen, neon, silicon, magnesium, sulfur, and iron. Once the core has turned to iron, it can no longer burn and the star collapses by its own gravity. The core becomes so tightly packed that pro- tons and electrons merge to form neutrons. In less than a second, the iron core, which is about the size of Earth, shrinks to a neutron core with a radius of about 6 miles (10 kilometers). The core heats to bil- lions of degrees and explodes (supernova ), releasing large amounts of energy and material into space. The remains of the core can form a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the mass of the original star. These are all things that will occur with our own sun and with stars in nearby star systems. Almost all of these ideas are big picture ideas but still applicable to understanding how our universe functions. Motion of the Earth and Moon Coming back closer to home, let's look at the motion of the earth and moon and how they intereact. The earth rotates (spins) on its axis once every 23 hours and 56 minutes. This causes day and night and makes most extraterrestrial objects seem to move around the sky in about one day. The earth also moves around the sun in an elliptical (nearly circular) orbit. It is moving about 67,000 miles per hour (107,000 km/hr) in its orbit around the sun. The earth moves around the center of the earth- moon system once a month. In comparison, Earth's revolution around the Sun takes much longer than its rotation on its axis. One complete revolution takes 365.24 days, or approximately one year. The earth revolves around the sun because the sun's gravity keeps it in a roughly circular orbit around the sun. Have you noticed the sun seems to shine a bit differently in the winter sky? It does. The tilt of Earth causes the sun to hit the earth differently at different points in the revolution. Because of this tilt of the earth's axis, we experience spring, summer, fall, and winter. The northern hemisphere experiences sum- mer when Earth is in the part of its orbit where the northern hemisphere is oriented more toward the sun. The sun therefore rises higher in the sky and is above the horizon longer, and the rays of the sun strike the ground more directly. Likewise, during winter in the northern hemisphere, the hemisphere is oriented away from the sun, the sun rises low in the sky and is above the horizon for a shorter period, and the rays of the sun strike the ground more obliquely.

An eclipse occurs when an astronomical object is obscured from view either by passing into the shadow of another object or by having another object pass between it and the viewer. A solar eclipse is when the moon crosses between the earth and the sun. A lunar eclipse, in contrast, is when the moon moves into the earth's shadow. The t ides, which are also a major part of the movement of the earth and moon, are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the gravitational forces of the moon and the sun and the rotation of the earth. Some regions of the world have two high tides and low tides each day, and some experience only one of each. Practice 7. The length of an Earth day is determined by the t ime it takes for one a. Earth rotation. b. Earth revolution. c. Sun rotation. d. Sun revolution. Summary Earth and space science covers the basic concepts of how the universe works, from the composition of the earth to Earth's interacting systems and renewable resources, from the birth and death of stars to the orbits of planets around them. Earth and space are governed by interacting systems, and Earth cycles, such as the hydrologic cycle, are mirrored in cosmic cycles, including the creation of stars and galaxies. If one of Earth's systems is disrupted, other par ts of the system are affected. For example, burning fossil fuels contributes to global warming. It is possi-ble that there are ways in which cosmic systems can also be disrupted, but these ideas are still being dis- covered. After we study Earth's systems and the composi- tion of the universe, it is easier to understand how h uman actions can affect our world and the universe around us. Earth and space science provides a basis for this understanding. Earth and Space Science r eview 1.

T he inner core is a solid mass of iron with a temperature of about 7,000\u00b0F; therefore, answer choice b is correct and choices a and d are incorrect. Most of the mass of the earth is con-tained in the mantle; therefore, choice c is inc orrect. 2. a. T he ocean absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, rather than producing carbon dioxide; therefore, choice b is incorrect. While choices c and d are factual, they do not answer the question. Regarding choice d, evaporation is part of the hydrologic cycle, not the carbon cycle. 3. c. Ear thquakes are caused by the shifting tec- tonic plates.

Yet human behavior is resulting in their d estruction around the globe. Corals and the algae that help them live are very sensitive to changes in salinity, water temperature, and acidity. The effects of global warming and climate change can be seen in the destruction of coral reefs around the world. Increas- ing water temperatures can negatively affect coral r eefs. The best temperature for corals is between 25\u00b0C and 31\u00b0C. In addition to warming the ocean, increases in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have made the ocean more acidic (decreased pH by 0.1). Emissions 331331 - - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE from burning fossil fuels (e.g., cars, industry, coal- burning power plants) contribute to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean, where it is turned into carbonic acid. This decrease in pH can harm or kill the small symbi- otic algae that live in the coral and help it thrive. 7. a. Ear th spins (rotates) on its axis once every 23 hours and 56 minutes. This causes day and night and makes most extraterrestrial objects seem to move around the sky in about one day. Earth and Space Science Review 1. a. A solar e clipse occurs when the moon moves between the earth and the sun. Choice b is incorrect because a lunar eclipse occurs when the earth's shadow comes between the sun and the moon. Choice c is incorrect because night occurs as the earth rotates every 24 hours. Solar flares are large emissions of energy from the sun; therefore, answer choice d is incorrect. 2. d. T he seasons are caused by the earth's tilt on its axis. Because the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the sun in summer, the rays of the sun hit that part of the earth more directly. A common misperception is that the seasons are caused by the earth being closer to the sun in summer (choice a) and farther away in winter. The days are longer in the summer (choice b), but that does not explain why the northern hemisphere experiences warming in summer. Choice c is an incorrect statement. 3. c. Pl uto is part of the Kuiper (asteroid) belt and shares its orbit around the sun with many other large asteroids; therefore, it is no longer considered a planet. Choice a is not true; Pluto does orbit the sun, but it just does so within an asteroid belt. The question asks for the primary reason that Pluto is not a planet, so b is not the correct choice. As for choice d, some planets have a moon and others do not; this is not a requirement for being considered a planet. In fact, Pluto has ve known moons. 4. Samp le answer: Plants remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and convert it to sugars through photosynthesis. During respiration, plants take O 2 from the atmosphere and replace it with CO2. 5. rEnE wab LE nOnrEnE wab LE rESOUrcE rESOUrcE plants oil wind coal sun gas water wood 6. Converging tectonic plates create mountains or island sy stems. When tectonic plates diverge, oceans are created. Tectonic plates can slide past each other, sepa- rate from each other (diverge), or come t ogether (converge). At some plate boundaries, one plate slides under the other (subduction). Converging plates create mountains. When two plates diverge, energy is dispersed, earthquakes occur, magma is released, and over the course of ages, oceans can form. The Atlantic Ocean was formed by the separation of plates over millions of years. 332332 - - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE 7. 1. Plants r emove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. 2.

Natural resources occur and exist in nature in some form and are used by humans for every aspect of survival. 9. In order for an eclipse to occur, the sun, earth, and moon must be aligned in a particular way. When the moon is positioned between the sun and the earth, the moon will prevent sunlight from reaching a portion of the earth. This is a solar eclipse. When the earth is positioned between the sun and the moon, the earth will prevent sunlight from reaching the moon. This is a lunar eclipse. 333333 - - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE 10. a.

Social Studies Practices and Knowledge Chapters In the next chapter, we will review the social studies practice skills in more detail. These skills, as noted previously, are used in each question to measure the critical thinking and reasoning skills that are essential to social studies success. Reviewing these skills is key to doing well on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test. Chap-ter 14, Social Studies Knowledge, features a basic re view of the four social studies areas covered on the GED\u00ae test. 336336 n n n chapter13 Social StudieS PracticeS This chapter focuses on reviewing and building the skills you need to master for test day. It covers what the GED\u00ae Testing Service refers to as social studies practices\u2014the critical thinking and reasoning skills that are essential to social studies success. These social studies practices are: Reading and Writing in a Social Studies Context: 30% of the GED\u00ae Social Studies test Applying Important Social Studies Concepts: 40% of the GED\u00ae Social Studies test Applying Mathematical Reasoning to Social Studies: 30% of the GED\u00ae Social Studies test B ecoming familiar with these skills and how the GED\u00ae test measures them is important for doing your best on test day. In addition to the social studies practices, this chapter provides you with an overview and practice for the extended response question found on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test. The answers and explanations for all practice questions are found at the end of the chapter. 337 n n n - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES reading and Writing in a Social Studies c ontext The GED\u00ae Social Studies test addresses reading and writing skills as they relate to the social studies con-tent areas (civics and government, U.S. history, eco-nomics, and geography and the world). About 30% of the quest ions on the test assess these skills. This means that doing well on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test requires you to be able to apply reading skills to a broad range of social studies topics. Your reading skills will be mostly tested through questio ns related to reading passages. These passages can be as short as a sentence or two, but they are more often one or two paragraphs. Rarely are passages lon-ger than three paragraphs. The passages used on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test inc lude primary source materials, such as speeches, letters, laws, excerpts from the U.S. Consti-tution, and other documents. Passages may also includ e secondary source materials in which an author provides an overview of an event, a person, or a geographic region, for example. In addition to read-ing passages, social studies reading skills may be assessed in written information provided in tables, charts, or other stimuli. Passages may be paired with just one question, or the y may have several questions. The questions are intended to assess your understanding of the passage and related social studies concepts. Questions related to reading in a social studies cont ext focus on the central ideas, the meaning of words and phrases, the author's point of view, the arguments that are made in the passage, and the evi-dence that supports those arguments. Sometimes a pair of passages is provided on the same topic, and you will be asked to compare and contrast them. The best approach for questions related to pas- sages is to look carefully at the clues provided in the passage. Read the passage carefully. Think about what the author is saying, the conclusions he or she is drawing, the arguments that are being made, and the details used to support these arguments. Read the question and consider your answer options. Go back and nd specic details in the passage that are related to the question. Determining Details to Make Logical Inferences or Valid Claims Making logical inferences sounds complicated, but it's not. In fact, you make inferences every day without thinking about it. When you hear \"Happy Birthday\" being sung, you infer that it is someone's birthday\u2014 even if you know nothing else about this person. If you see a school bus with yellow flashing lights, you would logically infer several things: there is a bus stop nearby. The school bus is about to stop. The trafc going both ways is about to stop. These are all logical inferences\u2014they follow from the evidence provided. Inferences can be illogical, too. If you used what you know about school buses and yellow flashing lights to infer that bus drivers love yellow, this would be an illogical inference. It would not be a valid claim. When taking the GED\u00ae test, the inferences and claims y ou make must be based on the information that is provided. When dealing with reading passages, this is a two-step process. Step 1: Determine Clearly Stated Details The rst thing you need to do is to focus on the details that the author includes. These may be facts, denitions, examples, or other evidence. This is the information that you will use to make logical infer - ences or claims. Other than a basic understanding of social st udies, you will not need a lot of other techni- cal or factual information outside of what you'll nd in the passage. 338338 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES Step 2: Make Logical Inferences or Valid Claims eXcerPt Friends and Citizens: This focuses on how you use the information that has been provided in the passage. Some questions will ask you whether you can make a logical inference from the facts, denitions, examples, and other details that have been provided. An inference is a conclusion that is drawn from the evidence provided. It is the conclu-sion that you reach logically from following the autho r's reasoning. A claim is a statement based on this inference. A valid claim is a statement that is rea- sonable or that can be supported by evidence, in this case by the e vidence provided in the passage. iNFereN ceS VerSu S claiMS \u0003n An inference is a conclusion that is drawn from the evidence provided. It is the con - clusion that you reach logically from fol- lowing the author's reasoning. \u0003 nA claim is a statement based on this infer - ence. \u0003n A valid claim is a statement that is rea - s onable or that can be supported by evidence. The GED\u00ae Social Studies test assesses your ability to make inferences in a variety of ways. Questions might ask about the context in which a speech or primary source document was written. Other questions might ask about the opinions or priorities of the author. You might even be asked what likely happened as a result of the speech or document. Practice Carefully read the following excerpt from a speech by Geo rge Washington and answer the question that follows. The period for a new election of a citi- zen to administer the executive government of the United States being not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts must be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with that important trust, it appears to me proper . . . that I should now apprise you of the resolu-tion I have formed, to decline being consid-ered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to be made. 1. Based on the excerpt, when did George Wash- ington make this speech? a. during his tenure as general of the Co ntinental Army b. at the Constitutional Convention c. prior to his rst presidential nomination d. during his second term as president Once you have made your inference, check your answe r. Ask yourself: Do the facts and evidence point to this conclusion? In this case, the facts do support the conclusion that Washington made this speech during his second term in ofce. As you can see from the example, making infer - ences may require your knowledge of social studies co ncepts. You could not determine the context of a speech by George Washington without knowing who Washington was, for instance. That said, it is important to focus on the evi- dence provided in the passage without involving your ow n assumptions or prejudices. Inference questions often ask about how an author\u2014or in the last exam-ple, a speaker and a president of the United States\u2014 fe els about a topic or historical event. When reading an excerpt from a speech by George Washington, how 339339 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES you feel about Washington or the presidency is not important; how Washington feels about his presi-dency is. Determining Central Ideas The GED\u00ae Social Studies test will also require you to determine the main ideas of excerpts from primary or secondary source documents. A primary source is an original piece of writing or art. Some good exam-ples are diary entries, letters, speeches, the texts of law s, and literary passages. A secondary source is a document that discusses a primary source. An exam-ple is an academic article about a novel. Questions may ask about the main idea of a passage as a whole or a section, paragraph, or other part of the passage. The main idea is a general statement that sums up what the author is saying. To determine the main idea, ask yourself two questions: 1. What is the passage (section/paragraph) mostly abou t? 2. What is the author trying to tell me? The main idea is often included in the rst sentence, bu t this is not always the case. An author may include an introductory paragraph to set the scene and then introduce the main idea. Or the author may build up to his or her point, causing the main idea to be found near or at the end of the passage or paragraph. Have you ever heard the expression that some- one \"can't see the forest for the trees\"? This means that w hen you are focused on the small stuff (trees), you miss the bigger picture (the forest). This can hap-pen with the main idea as well. To nd the main idea, you need to look at the forest\u2014the passage as a whole. This can be somewhat counterintuitive: rather than reading each word carefully, you may be better able to assess the main idea by reading the entire pas-sage as a whole. Practice 2. Read the following paragraph and underline the se nt ence that shows the main idea. When Christopher Columbus landed in the New World, he brought with him horses, cattle, and seeds for planting. Over the next decades, European explorers and set-tlers brought to the New World other do mesticated animals and plants. Wheat and other grains soon became a staple crop in North America. Meanwhile, from the New World to the Old went corn, squash, tur - keys, tomatoes, and the ever-important po tato. This transfer of plants, animals, and diseases, known as the Columbian Exchange, transformed the diets and life-styles of people on both sides of the Atlantic. Figuring Out the Meaning of Words and Phrases As with any type of study, the social studies disci- plines\u2014economics, geography, history, and govern-ment\u2014al l have words and phrases that are somewhat unique to them. While you should study and learn common social studies terms, you are not expected to know more specic vocabulary terms. What you are expected to be able to do, however, is to gure out the meaning of these words in context. What does this mean? Basically, you become a de tective on the hunt for clues in the rest of the pas- sage. When you come upon an unfamiliar word or phr ase, look at the words around that word or phrase. Often, they can unlock the meaning. Then move out-ward from there, looking for clues in the other parts of the sentence, other sentences, and nally other parts of the passage. In some cases, the word may be 340340 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES n n n dened in a passage. In other cases, its meaning may become clear from the examples that are used. In still others, meaning may be discerned by looking at the greater context\u2014that is, the overall meaning of the sentence, paragraph, and/or passage. Some words have more than one meaning. You may be expected to gure out how a word with differ - ent meanings is used in a sentence or phrase. Take the wo rd convention, for example. A convention can mean a formal assembly or gathering, a political meeting at which candidates are selected, an agreed-upon contract, the customary way of doing things, or a familiar or preferred writing style. Practice Read each of the following sentences, and then match it t o the correct denition of convention from the choices listed. 3. The organization will hold its 45th annual con-vention in June. 4. The military government clashed with the con-ventions of the native peoples. 5. One of the reasons it can be difcult to read histo rical documents is that they follow differ - ent conventions from those used today. Denitions: a. customary way of doing things b. formal assembly or gathering c. familiar or preferred writing style As you can see, you need to think about how a word is used in c ontext to gure out what it means. Points of View and Purposes Understanding a text often goes beyond the words in front of you. You must also consider how and why it was written. This involves two things: point of view and the author's purpose (or the purpose of the document). Point of view is simpl y the perspective from which someone writes something. A person's point of view is based on his or her background, experiences, and understanding of events and is tied to his or her opinions. For example, the American colonists and the British Parliament clearly had very different points of view regarding the American Revolution and the events leading up to it, and therefore had very different opinions about the Revolution itself. You will often know quite a bit about an author's point of view by knowing who the author is. Author's purpose is simpl y the reason that an author is writing something. In some cases, it will help to consider who the intended audience is. Is the document meant for the whole population, or is it written for a certain group, such as the members of Congress? What does the document want to accom-plish? Is it trying to document facts to support a pro-posal? Is it trying to call people to take action? Ask yourself: Why did the author write this? Who is the audience? What is this document intended to accomplish? Practice R ead the following excerpt from an 1884 Congressio- nal hearing and then answer the following question. eXcerPt They who say that women do not desire the right of suffrage, that they prefer masculine domination to self-government, falsify every page of history, every fact in human experi - ence. It has taken the whole power of the ci vil and canon law to hold woman in the subordinate position which it is said she willingly accepts. 341341 6. Think about who would have written the passage and why. The purpose of thispassage is to ________________________. n n - - _________SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES Fact and Opinion Just because something is stated in a passage does not mean that it is true. Most written material has some bias. Bias is just a preference for one thing or another or one point of view over another. Since almost everyone has personal opinions about everything from food to television shows, bias will probably be a part of anything you read, even if the writer tries very hard to be neutral. A good reader must notice bias and tell the difference between facts and opinions. A fact is a statement that can be veried. Exam- ples t ypically include the dates in which events took place and the names o f the people involved. An opinion is a belief held by one person or a group of people. It cannot be veried or proven. Even if the majority has the same opinion, it does not make it a fact. To differentiate between facts and opinions, consid er the following questions: Would everyone agree with this statement? Can it be veried by a trustworthy source? T he answer to both of these questions must be \"yes\" for it t o be a fact. recogN iziNg oPiN ioNS Be alert to common words that may introduce a state - ment of opinion: likely believe possibly say probably charge should/could attest think feel Facts and opinions may occur in a wide range of pri - mary and secondary source materials. Editorials by denitio n include an author's opinion, but they also often include facts that support this opinion. Ency-clopedias and social studies textbooks, on the other hand, fo cus on presenting facts with as little bias as possible. Differentiating between facts and opinions is not alwa ys as easy as it appears. Sometimes this is because we bring our own perspectives and biases to the equation. Consider the following statement. The American Revolution was a necessary ght for freedom. Y ou may agree with this statement. Most of the peo- ple you know may agree with this statement. There may b e many facts and reasons that support this statement. But it is still an opinion. It cannot be veri-ed by any sources. Sometimes words will be used to emphasize that it is the author's opinion, such as when an author writes \"I think . . .\" or \"we believe.\" A recommenda-tion for a change is also typically an opinion, although it may be based on very real facts. Look also for com- parative or superlative terms (he was the best pr esi- dent; there is too muc h/not enough attention paid to this issue). Practice Look at the following statements and decide whether each is a fa ct or an opinion. 7.The United States has a population thatexc eeds 316 billion. _________ 8.The U.S. population is growing too quickly. 9.The fastest-growing segment of the U.S. popu-lation is adults over the age of 65. __________ 342342 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES Determine the Validity of Hypotheses A hypothesis is a statement that has not been proven to be true or false. Some hypotheses are assumed to be true, but they cannot be proven. In social studies, hypotheses may include what might have happened if an event had not occurred or if someone else had been the leader when an event occurred. People may have many hypotheses about what might have hap-pened had the United States not developed the atomic bo mb, for instance. In this case, the hypothesis can- not be proven since this has already happened. People can also have hypotheses about what will happen in the future. For instance, \"The threat of terrorism will continue to grow\" or \"The Republican Party will splinter into two factions\" are hypotheses that will prove true or untrue over time. The GED\u00ae Social Studies test assesses your abil- ity to tell whether a hypothesis is based on evidence. What is evidence? Evidence is simply the facts and reasons that point to a conclusion. To support the hypothesis that World War II would have dragged on had the United States not developed the atomic bomb, an author might provide evidence about the numbers of casualties prior to the atomic bomb, the readiness plans of Japan and other combatants, let-ters revealing the impact of the atomic bomb, and so f orth. To decide whether a hypothesis is based on evi- dence, ask the following questions: n What is the author saying? What is his or her hypothesis? (This will often be provided as the question.) What reasons, facts, and evidence does the author provide? Do these reasons, facts, and evidence logically support the author's hypothesis? n n Practice R ead the passage and answer the question that fol lows. MacHu PiccHu Machu Picchu is an ancient stone city situ - ated on a mountain ridge high in the Peru- vian Andes, above the Sacred Valley. The In cas built the city around 1450, at the height of their empire. The city follows a strict plan in which agricultural and residen-tial areas are separated by a large square. Most ar cheologists believe that Machu Pic- chu served as a religious and ceremonial center of the Incan empire. T he Incas chose Machu Picchu for its un ique location and features. Getting to Machu Picchu requires a journey up a nar - row path. This makes it easily defended, as no one could approach without being spotted. Machu Picchu was abandoned shortly af ter Spanish conquistadors vanquished the Incan empire. Over the next several centu-ries, the jungle reclaimed the site on which Ma chu Picchu lay. The site was once again discovered by an American historian and explorer in 1911. Since then, archeologists have flocked to the site to see what they can learn about the Incas. Today, Machu Picchu\u2014the Lost City of the Incas\u2014is the most visited site in Peru. 343343 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES 10. Which hypothesis is supported by the evidence in this passage? a.The I ncas would have expanded their empire had Col umbus not discovered the Americas. b. If Machu Picchu had not been discovered in1911, we w ould not know anything about the Incas. c.Machu Picchu would have survived manymore y ears had Columbus not discovered the Americas. d.If the Incas had built fortied centers onlowe r ground, they would have been able to beat the conquistadors. Compare Two Sources on the Same Social Studies Topic Comparing social studies texts is no different from comparing two movies or two television programs. In some cases, the sources to be compared will express opposite opinions, with one author expressing an opinion in favor of a cause and another against it, for instance. In other instances, one passage may be a primary source written by an eyewitness or partici-pant in an event, while another might be a secondary source that analyzes that event. In these cases, the dif- ferences between the authors' positions might not be as easy to ide ntify. Regardless of what types of sources are being compar ed, the approach is the same: comparing and contrasting will require you to look for similarities and differences between them. This will often require you to examine both sources more than once. For example, you might see pieces of two fam ous documents from U.S. history, such as a passage from the Declaration of Independence of 1776 and a portion of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. eXcerPt F roM tHe declaratioN oF iNd ePeNd eNce, 1776 We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. . . . [W]hen a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. 344344 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES eXcerPt F roM tHe alieN aNd SeditioN act S, 1798 SECTION 1. Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That if any persons shall unlawfully combine or conspire together, with intent to oppose any measure or measures of the government of the United States, which are or shall be directed by proper authority, or to impede the operation of any law of the United States, or to intimidate or prevent any person holding a place or office in or under the government of the United States, from undertaking, performing or executing his trust or duty, and if any person or persons, with intent as aforesaid, shall counsel, advise or attempt to procure any insurrection, riot, unlawful assembly, or combination, whether such conspiracy, threatening, coun - s el, advice, or attempt shall have the proposed effect or not, he or they shall be deemed guilty of a high misdemeanor. . . . SECTION 2. And be it farther enacted, That if any person shall write, print, utter or publish, or shall cause or procure to be written, printed, uttered or published, or shall knowingly and willingly assist or aid in writing, printing, uttering or publishing any false, scandalous and malicious writing or writings against the government of the United States, or either house of the Congress of the United States, or the President of the United States, with intent to defame the said government, or either house of the said Congress, or the said President, or to bring them, or either of them, into contempt or disrepute; or to excite against them, or either or any of them, the hatred of the good people of the United States, or to stir up sedition within the United States, or to excite any unlawful combinations therein, for opposing or resisting any law of the United States, or any act of the President of the United States, done in pursuance of any such law, or of the powers in him vested by the constitution of the United States, or to resist, oppose, or defeat any such law or act, or to aid, encourage or abet any hostile designs of any foreign nation against United States, their people or government, then such person . . . shall be punished by a fine not exceeding two thou - sand dollars, and by imprisonment not exceeding two years. In this case, it is helpful to remember some United States history. Thomas Jefferson, who later became the third president of the United States, wrote the Declaration of Independence, which was approved by the Continental Congress in 1776. John Adams, the second president of the United States, signed the Dec-laration of Independence. Adams was president when the Alie n and Sedition Acts were written, and he approved them. But even if you do not know this context, you would recognize that these two documents emerged during the earliest part of the history of the United States\u2014a period of revolution. Read both carefully and ask yourself: \"What do these two passages have in common?\" It is clear they are talking about govern- ments and how citizens should behave toward their governments. You don't have to read too far into the Declaration of Independence to know what it is about. In fact, it's clear from the title. Jefferson is arguing that it is the right and duty of the people to overthrow an unjust government. However, the por- tion of the Sedition Act above makes it illegal to com- 345345 n n n - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES bine or conspire together, with intent to oppose any measure or measures of the government of the United States. Summary of reading and W riting in a Social Studies c ontext As you can see, the reading skills assessed in the GED\u00ae Social Studies test are interrelated. These are the same skills that are needed by a reader in any other discipline. Most social studies passages will be fairly straightforward, but you will need to make inferences based on the passage and an overall under - standing of social studies. You may be asked\u2014explic-itly or implicitly\u2014to identify the main idea(s) and/or de termine the author's point of view and purpose. Other questions may focus on the opinions and claims of the author and whether these are supported by the details. Be a detective. Look for clues that will help you b etter understand the text. In addition to the pas- sage itself, look for the title, the date it was writ-ten, and the background of the person who wrote it\u2014all o f these can provide you with valuable information. Be an active reader. A sk questions as you read. Stop and reread things that you don't understand. Check your instincts. In most cases when taking an y type of test, your rst instinct is correct. But before you submit it, check your answer by look-ing back at the text to nd details that support it. applying important Social Studies c oncepts The GED\u00ae Social Studies test asks you to apply rea- soning skills to the social studies content areas (civics and g overnment, U.S. history, economics, and geog- raphy and the world). About 40% of the questions you 'll encounter on the test require these skills. Success on this part of the test will require you to think logically about arguments, events, and ideas. You may need to look at the evidence and nd details that support a claim that is made. You may need to consider the bias or point of view evident in a written excerpt, political cartoon, propaganda poster, or other visual element. Some questions may require you to look at two events and decide whether the rst event caused the second or to identify the cause or effect from a list of items. Let's look in more detail at how more specic reaso ning skills may apply to the test. Use Evidence to Support Inferences or Analyses The GED\u00ae Social Studies test will assess your ability to nd evidence in written material to support an inference or a claim. As discussed in the previous sec-tion, an inference is a conclusion that is drawn from the evidence provided. In addition to making infer - ences, the GED\u00ae Social Studies test will ask you to nd the details, facts, or other information to support these inferences. There are some words and phrases that authors oft en use to introduce evidence in support of an opinion or main idea. Look for phrases (e.g., for example, for instance, in particular, a reason is, in one case) that suggest the author is providing you with a reason or supporting detail. Charts, graphs, or political cartoons are also some times used to assess this skill. For instance, you may be asked to nd specic information on a graph that suggests something has happened. 346346 Which statement about the data presented on this chart is correct? a. b. c. d. Choice c is the correct answer. To answer this question correctly, you have to consider - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES 347347 Take a look at the following graph. Women as a Percentage of Party Caucuses U.S. House and http://cawp.rutgers.edu/footnotes/party_caucuses/women-as-percentage-of-party-caucuses-1917-to-2013. \u00a9 Center for American Women and Politics Center for American Women and Politics First, let's break this chart down. The x-axis\u2014the bottom line\u2014contains a tick mark for each Congress from 1917 to 2013, which are the 65th through the 113th congressional sessions. The y-axis\u2014the vertical line\u2014denotes the percentages. The various lines rep- resent women Democrats and w omen Republicans in the House of Representatives and women Democrats and women Republicans in the Senate. On the GED\u00ae Social Studies test, a graph like this one will often be accompanied by a question like the following. Select the choice that you think is cor- rect, and then we'll analyze each choice to see if there is evidence in the graph to support it. More women run for Congressional seats asDemocrats than as Republicans. The number of women Republicans in theSenate has increased steadily since 1917. The percentage of Congressional Democratswho are women has increased sharply sincethe 102nd Congress. Republicans have tended not to vote forfemale Congressional candidates since the102nd Congress. - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES whether there is evidence in the chart that clearly supports the statement. Let's start with choice a: a. More women run for Congressional seats as De mocrats than as Republicans. This may be an attractive choice because it is clear that f emale Democrats (the lighter lines in the chart) represent a larger proportion of their party in Congress than Republican women. But we cannot conclude based only on this chart that this is because more Democratic women run for ofce. Next, let's look at choice b: b. The number of women Republicans in the Senat e has increased steadily since 1917. This might look possible at rst glance, but it is impo rtant to remember that this is a chart that shows the percentage of Republicans in Con-gress that are women. It does not show the exa ct number of women Republicans that were serving in Congress at any given time. Even so, the chart shows that women Republicans as a percentage of all Congressional Republicans has varied widely over time. Moving on to choice c: c. The percentage of Congressional Democrats who ar e women has increased sharply since the 102nd Congress. This choice is clearly supported by the chart and is thus c orrect. Look at the lighter lines in the chart and you can see a sharp upturn in both starting around the 102nd Congress. The percentage of Congressional Democrats who are women increased from around 5% to around 30% in that time span. Finally, let's examine choice d: d. Republicans have tended not to vote for female Cong ressional candidates since the 102nd Congress. There is no evidence to support this statement. The c hart does not give us any information about the number of women who have run for a Co ngressional seat on the Republican ticket, and there is no evidence in the chart that would allow us to make speculations about Republican voting preferences. Thus, this choice is incorrect. Describe Social Studies Concepts and Connections between Them Some of the questions on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test will ask you to describe relationships between or among people, places, environments, processes, or events. Sometimes these questions will stand on their own, but other times there will be a short reading passage or graphic\u2014or both\u2014for you to consider. Being able to sum up or describe quickly what you read is an important skill. Practice Read the paragraph and answer the question that fol lows. reduciNg carBo N FootP riNt Jim Blanchard is looking for ways to reduce his carbon footprint. He takes his own bags to the grocery store and avoids anything that is packaged in plastic. He also collects recycla - bles and takes them to the recycling center. Jim does not own a car. He uses mass transit to reach most places he needs to go to. He also owns an electric scooter, so he does not use gasoline. 11. How would you describe Jim Blanchard?

Brazil's success as a beef exporter will lead to co ntinued deforestation by 2015. d. Argentina's lack of success as a beef exporter wil l lead it to preserve the rain forest in 2015. Put Events or Steps in Order Some questions on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test will ask you to put historical events in the order in which they occurred. You may also be asked to understand the order of steps in a social studies process, such as how a bill becomes a law. Some of these questions may use a time line or flow chart to provide a visual depiction of the order of events or steps in a process. A time line is a chart that organizes events or activities in the order in which they occur. When writers use time as their main organiza- tion principle, it is called chr onological order. They describe events in the order in which they did hap-pen, will happen, or should happen. Much of what you will read on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test will be organized in this way, including historical texts, instructions and procedures, and essays about per - sonal experiences. Passages organized by chronology typically use a lot of transitional words and phrases. The transi- tions help us see when things happened and in what o rder. They help us follow along when the passage shifts from one period of time to another. The following is a list of some of the most com- mon chronological transitions: rst, second, third, (etc.), before after, next, now then, when, as soon as immediately, suddenly, soon during, while, meanwhile later, in the meantime, at last eventually, nally, afterward Practice 15. P ut the events listed in the correct order. How a Bill Becomes a Law 1. __________________________________ 2. __________________________________ 3. __________________________________ 4. __________________________________ 5. __________________________________ 6. __________________________________ The differences are ironed out in a Conference Committee. The bill is then presented to the president. The House and Senate pass different versions of the bill. The bill is introduced to Congress. The president signs the bill. The bill returns to Congress, where it must be passed through both houses. Analyze Cause-and-Effect Relationships The GED\u00ae Social Studies test will ask you to identify the relationships between events. Often, historical events are connected to situations that came before them. There are several things to keep in mind when you are considering cause-and-effect relationships: There may be multiple causes for an event. n There may be multiple effects of an event. 350350 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES n Just because events occur near the same time or in the same place does not mean they are related or that one caused the other. n Sometimes the question of what is considered a cause can be controversial. C ause-and-effect questions are often associated with a w ritten excerpt, but they may also ask about data presented in a time line or other chart or graph, or a combination of both. Practice Look at the time line, read the excerpt from the decla-ration made by South Carolina when it seceded from the U nion, and then answer the question that follows. Civil War Time Line, 1860-1865 December 20, 1860 South Carolina is the rst to secede from the Union. A pril 12, 1861 The rst shots of the Civil War are red at Fort Sumter. J anuary 1, 1863 Lincoln issues the Emancipa-tion Proclamation. A pril 9, 1865 General Robert E. Lee surren-ders at Appomattox Court-house in Virginia. eXcerPt The people of the State of South Carolina . . . declared that the frequent violations of the Constitution of the United States, by the Federal Government, and its encroach - ments upon the reserved rights of the States, fully justified this State in then with- drawing from the Federal Union. . . . We affirm that these ends for which th is Government was instituted have been defeated, and the Government itself has been made destructive of them by the action of the non-slaveholding States. Those States have assumed the right of deciding upon the propriety of our domes-tic institutions. . . . They have encouraged an d assisted thousands of our slaves to leave their homes; and those who remain, have been incited by emissaries, books and pictures to servile insurrection. 16. Based on the time line and excerpt, which is a fac tor that contributed to South Carolina's decision to secede from the Union? a. President Lincoln freed the slaves. b. The Union red upon the Confederacy at Fo rt Sumter. c. Abolitionists were encouraging slaves to re bel. d. The Confederacy offered greater protection fro m foreign aggression. Compare Sets of Ideas The GED\u00ae test will also assess your ability to com-pare differing sets of ideas. These ideas might have to do with civics or economics. For instance, you might be asked to compare ideas about how to organize an economy or govern a country. 351351 - - _____________________________________ _____________________________________ _____________________________________ SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES Practice The U.S. political landscape is dominated by the Re publican and Democratic parties. Review the table and answer the following question. rePuB licaN P arty deM ocratic P arty Free market economy Minimum wages and labor unions Limited government Higher tax rates for wealthy citizens Strong national defense Government support for social programs and must. Also, watch for strongly worded statements that include terms like always or never; these often represent strong viewpoints that are prone to bias. Bias can also be shown by using words with positive associations when referring to things the writer agrees with or supports and using words with negative asso - ciations when referring to things the writer disagrees with. Practice R ead the following passage. Then answer the ques- tion that follows. 17. Based on the table, which party would be most like ly to cut the food stamp program in order to reduce the decit? a. Republican b. Democratic Identify Bias and Propaganda The next skill we will look at involves identifying bias and propaganda. Let's rst learn about bias. Bias Bias is a prejudice in favor of or against one thing, p erson, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair. You can think of bias as a personal preference. Everyone has personal preferences. Even if writ- ers try not to show these preferences, there is likely to be some bias in what they write. Bias is closely related to an author's point of view. For instance, someone who grew up in a family in which multiple adults served in the military might have a tendency to respect service members and believe them to be hon-orable and courageous. Someone who grew up in a war-t orn area where soldiers behaved violently toward civilians might have a strong bias against members of the armed forces. To detect bias, watch for words that try to tell the r eader how to think or behave. These are called prescriptive words and include terms such as should tougH tiMeS With the economy lagging, many Ameri - cans are out of work. Unemployment bene- fits should be extended to help citizens we ather these tough times. At the same time, the United States cannot afford to turn its back on the elderly, children, and poor families who have always relied on government assistance. Despite the down-turn in the economy, the rich continue to ge t richer. The best way\u2014perhaps the only way\u2014to help the country succeed is to increase revenue by raising taxes for those who can afford to pay higher taxes. 18. What bias is evident in this passage? Write your answe r on the following lines. Propaganda Propaganda re fers to techniques that try to influence opinions, emotions, and attitudes in order to benet an organization or individual. Propaganda uses lan-guage that targets the emotions\u2014fears, beliefs, 352352 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES n n n values, prejudices\u2014instead of appealing to reason or critical thinking. Advertising, media, and political campaigns use propaganda techniques to influence others. To detect propaganda, ask yourself the follow-ing questions about the information: Whom does it benet? What are its sources? What is the purpose of the text? Y ou should be aware of a number of propaganda tec hniques: Bandwagon: The basic message of bandwagon pro paganda is: \"Everyone else is doing some- thing , so you should do it, too.\" It appeals to the desire t o join the crowd or be on the winning team. Phrases like \"Americans buy more of our brand than any other brand\" or \"the brand that picky parents choose\" are examples of the bandwagon technique. To evaluate a message, ask these questions: n Does this program or policy serve my partic- ular interests? n What is the evidence for or against it? Common man: This approach tries to convince you that its message is just plain old common sense. Politicians and advertisers often speak in everyday language and present themselves as one of the people to appeal to their audience. For example, a presidential candidate cam - paig ning in New Hampshire may wear a plaid shirt and cho p wood or visit a mill in order to look like an ordinary citizen. To determine if the common-man technique is being used, ask yourself these questions: n What ideas is the person presenting? Are the ideas presented differently than the person's usual image or language? n What are the facts? Euphemisms: Instead of emotionally loaded language that r ouses its audience, these terms soften an unpleasant reality. Terms that soften the nature of war are often used. In the 1940s, for example, the U.S. government renamed the War Department the Department of Defense. Stay alert to euphemisms. What facts are being softened or hidden? Ge neralities: This approach uses words and phrases that evoke deep emotions. Examples of generalities are honor, peace, freedom, and home. These words carry strong associations for most people. By using these terms, a writer can appeal to the emotions so that the reader will accept his or her message without evaluating it. Generalities are vague so that you will supply your own interpretations and not ask further questions. An example might be: \"The United States must further restrict immigration in order to preserve freedom and liberty.\" T ry to challenge what you read and hear. Ask your self: n n n What does the generality really mean? Has the author used the generality to sway my emotions? If I take the generality out of the sentence, what are the merits of the idea? L abe ling or name-calling: This method links a negative label, name, or phrase to a person, group, belief, or nation. It appeals to hate and fears. Name-calling can be a direct attack, or it can be indirect, using ridicule. Labels can evoke deep emotions, such as Commie, Nazi, or ter - rorist. They can be negatively charged, depend- ing o n the situation: yuppie , hipster, slacker, liberal, or reactionary. When a written text or speech uses labeling, ask yourself these questions: n Does the label have any real connection to the idea being presented? 353353 - - __________________________ ______________________________ SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES n If I take away the label, what are the merits of the idea? Testimonials: In advertising, athletes promote a range of products, from cereal to wrist-watches. In politics, celebrities endorse presi-dential candidates. Both are examples of testimonials. A testimonial uses a public gure, expert, or other respected person to endorse a policy, organization, or product. Because you respect or admire a person, you may be less critical and accept what he or she says more readily. Ask yourself these questions: n Does the public gure have any expert knowledge about this subject? n Without the testimonial, what are the merits of the message? Practice 20. What was the goal of this poster? Analyze How Historical Circumstances Shape Point of View Questions on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test may ask you to consider how historical circumstances shape an author's point of view. You may also need to assess how believable an author is based on an understand-ing of his or her bias. When you come across information, consider po int of view and bias by asking the following ques- tions: n Who wrote the text? Who is the intended audience? Under what circumstances was the text written? What is the purpose of the text? n n n I n short, the more you know about the text, the more you w ill understand its point of view and/or bias. Point of view is how someone looks at an event. A p erson's point of view is based on his or her back- ground, experiences, and understanding of events. Fo r example, a person who grew up in a family that had little money might think buying an expensive car or jewelry is wasteful. From that person's point of view, spending a lot of money on something that isn't a necessity is bad. Practice Read the following excerpt from the speech \"Ain't I a Wo man?\" delivered in 1851 by African-American abolitionist and women's rights activist Sojourner Truth, and then answer the question that follows. 19. Who was the intended audience for this poster? 354354 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES n n n n n eXcerPt Well, children, where there is so much racket there must be something out of kil - ter. I think that 'twixt the Negroes of the South and the women at the North, all talk- ing about rights, the white men will be in a fix pr etty soon. But what's all this here talk- ing about? That man over there says that women ne ed to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place! And ain't I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me! And ain't I a woman? I could work as much and eat as much as a man, when I could get it, and bear the lash as well! And ain't I a woman? I have borne thirteen children, and seen most all sold off to slavery, and when I cried out with my mother's grief, none but Jesus heard me! And ain't I a woman? Then they talk about this thing in the he ad; what's this they call it? [A member of the audience whispers, \"Intellect.\"] That's it, honey. What's that got to do with wom-en's rights or negroes' rights? If my cup wo n't hold but a pint, and yours holds a quart, wouldn't you be mean not to let me have my little half measure full? 21. In this excerpt, the point of view that So journer Truth is expressing when she repeat- edly asks \"And ain't I a woman?\" is a. that former female slaves deserve the same cour tesies as white women. b. that women deserve equal rights because they ar e as capable as men. c. that all men will suffer if they do not offer wo men equal rights. d. that intellect should influence whether a wo man deserves equal rights. Summary of a pplying important Social Studies c oncepts The most important thing when taking the GED\u00ae Social Studies test is to think carefully about what the question is asking. You will nd that you can answer a lot of the questions by applying simple common sense to a basic understanding of social studies concepts. Many of the questions will be based on a writ- ten excerpt, a graph, a political cartoon, a picture, or a co mbination of these things. Regardless of the types of passages or graphics you encounter, take the fol-lowing steps: Look at the title or titles (if there are any): What do they tell you about the main idea? Look for the date or source of the information: What does this tell you about the context? Look at the author: What do you know about his or her background that may influence the point of view? Read the passage or visual element carefully: Look for the main idea and supporting details. Step back and consider the big picture: What is the author or illustrator trying to tell you? 355355 n - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES Finally, when you are ready to answer the ques-tion, look again at the passage or visual stimulus to mak e sure your initial impulse is correct. applying Mathematical reasoning to Social Studies The GED\u00ae Social Studies test asks you to apply basic mathematical skills to the social studies content areas (civics and government, U.S. history, economics, and geography and the world). About 30% of the ques-tions on the GED\u00ae test require these skills. Success on this part of the test does not require you to be a mathematician. However, you will need to know basic mathematical principles and terms, such as what an average means. You will also need to be able to apply basic principles, perhaps by guring out the average of two or more numbers. Keep in mind that these questions are designed to assess your abil-ity to use math to address soc ial studies problems, not such computation skills as adding or multiplying. Many of these skills are assessed by having you look at information presented in tables, charts, graphs, and maps. You may also be asked to apply mathematical reasoning to a political cartoon, photo-graph, or short passage. As a basic example, a map or char t may provide statistical data on population growth within individual states, but you may need to use your own knowledge about where the states are located to assess regional trends or how population growth is likely to affect a particular issue. Let's look in more detail at how mathematical skills ar e applied to the social studies discipline. Analyze Information Presented Visually The GED\u00ae Social Studies test will assess your ability to analyze information that is presented visually. This information may be presented in maps, tables, charts, or other stimuli used to organize and present infor - mation in a logical manner. You may also be asked to analyz e information in a political cartoon, a photo- graph, an advertisement, or a propaganda poster, for example. R eading and understanding a map, chart, graph, or other stimulus is very similar to reading a passage. You want to look for clues about the meaning. Ask yourself the same two questions as when trying to understand the main idea of a reading passage: 1. What is this mostly about? 2. What is the author (or illustrator) trying to tell me? With many types of visual stimuli, the title can pro-vide valuable clues. Often, the year (or years) repre-sented in the map, chart, or graph will be included in the title. If not, look for this information elsewhere. Tables Tables organize information in columns and rows. Lab els in the rst column describe the information contained in the rows to the right of the rst column. The labels at the top (column heads) describe the information in the columns below. COLUMN BORDER ROW Label Label Label Label Label Cell 356356 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES Here is an example of the type of table you will see on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test. World Energy Consumption, 1970-2020 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 History Projections Quadrillion Btu 207 243 493 382 439 366 311285 346 552 612 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 1999 2005 2010 2015 2020 x-axis y-axis World Energy Consumption, 1970-2020 Year Quadrillion Btu Consumed 1970 207 1975 243 1980 285 1985 311 1990 346 1995 366 1999 382 2005 439 2010 493 2015 552 2020 612 Line Graphs Next, let's look at a line graph. It is similar to a bar graph because there is information presented along the x-axis and y-axis, and you'll need to look at both to understand the graph. Bar Graphs A bar graph is one way to present facts visually. A bar graph features a vertical axis (running up and down on the left-hand side of the graph) and a horizontal axis (running along the bottom of the graph). Immigrants Admitted to the United States, Fiscal Years 1900-2000 Thousands 1,950 1,800 1,650 1,500 1,350 1,200 1,050 900 750 600 450 300 150 0 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 The horizontal axis is known as the x-axis. The vertical axis is known as the y-axis. The graph repre- sents quantities in strips or bars. Graphs are especially useful for showing changes over time or comparing two or more quantities or trends. To construct a bar graph from the table \"World Energ y Consumption, 1970-2020,\" mark the ve- year increments on the bottom horizontal axis (x-axis) and the units of energy consumed (by incre-ments of 100 quadrillion Btu) on the vertical axis (y -axis). By representing the table's data in a bar graph, you can visualize the world's energy consump-tion trend more easily. As you can see, line graphs are good for showing changes over time. In this case, we have a chart that depicts the number of immigrants admitted into the United States between 1900 and 2000. The line is use - ful because it shows not only an increase in the num-ber of immigrants admitted, but the years in which the n umbers increased dramatically or stayed rela- tively stable. Noticing these kinds of changes will help you interpret line graphs on the GED\u00ae Social Studies 357357 Doughnuts 26% Danish 8% Muffins 34% of Breakfast Sales Croissants Bagels 15% 17% Muffins - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES test because sharp increases and decreases shown on a line graph are usually signicant to the question you are facing. Circle Graphs/Pie Charts Circle graphs, also called pie char ts, look nothing like bar and line graphs; they even lack an x-axis and a y-axis. Circle graphs display information so that you can see relationships between parts and a whole. The information on a circle graph can be presented as percentages or as actual numbers. The circle is divided into parts, or pie slices, that together add up to the whole. To understand a circle graph, rst read the title. What does the graph represent? Read all other headings and labels. What does each portion of the circle represent? Now you are ready to see how the parts relate to each other. The following circle graph illustrates the items making up the entire amount of bakery goods sold by the Grainville Baking Company. Notice that this graph includes a title, labels, and a legend. Maps Maps are printed or drawn representations of a geo- graphic area. Social scientists use different types of maps to understand the natural or cultural facts about an area. Maps can visually display many kinds of information, such as the physical features of the land, political boundaries between nations, or popu-lation densities. n Topographic maps show the physical features of land, including land elevations and depressions, water depth, rivers, forests, mountains, and human-made cities and roads. n Political maps display political divisions and borders. n Special-purpose maps can depict a wide range of information about an area, from average rainfall, crop distribution, or population density to migration patterns of people. T o read a map, carefully review each of the following: n Title describes what the map represents. n Legend or key is a table or list that explains the symbols used in a map. n Latitude and longitude: Latitude refers to the lines on a map that are parallel to the equator; longitude refers to lines parallel to the prime meridian that run north and south through 358358 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES n Greenwich, England. These lines help to locate specic areas on a map. n Scale shows the map's proportion in relation to the actual area it represents. For example, on a topographic map, the scale might show the dis-tance on the map that equals a mile or kilometer on land. Analyze Numerical, Technical, and Written Materials on a Common Topic Some of the questions on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test will include more than one type of stimulus. They might include both a passage and a chart, for example. You may have to gure out whether differ - ent types of information go together\u2014in other wo rds, whether the information that is presented in a chart, graph, or other format goes with information in the written material, and vice versa. These types of questions should be fairly easy; do n't overcomplicate them. Look for the main idea of the passage that is provided. What is it mostly about? Then look at the main idea of the chart, graph, or other stimulus that is provided. Is it about the same topic? Other questions may ask you to point out dif- ferences between two types of information on the same t opic. For instance, a question might present two sets of information about immigration\u2014from different centuries or focused on different countries. You might then be asked to point out similarities and differences in the information. Create Tables, Graphs, and Charts Some questions on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test will ask you to take written information and put it into a table or graph. Again, the key here is not to overcom-plicate things. Take the following steps: Read the excerpt. Look for the numbers and sta-t istics that are included. n Look at the labels on the table or chart. Note how the information is organized. n Transfer the numbers and statistics to the table or chart. Quest ions may ask you to provide the labels for a char t or graph. The types of labels needed will vary depending on the chart or graph. n Line graphs typically include labels for the x-axis and the y-axis. If the line graph shows a trend over time, the years are typically represented on the x-axis, with the item being measured shown on the y-axis. n Bar graphs typically include a series of bars across the graph. They will need labels for the x-axis and y-axis. n Circle graphs (or pie charts) show elements in relation to one another and to the whole. They often use a legend to show what the elements are, but labels may or may not be used to spell out the actual numbers or percentages. C harts and graphs, like other visual stimuli, will also in clude titles. Some questions may ask you to add a title to a chart or graph. Again, all you need to do to answer these kinds of questions is to look for the main idea. Y ou may also need to look at the legend to see what years or other categories are included in the graph. Interpret Graphs and Use Data to Predict Trends On the GED\u00ae Social Studies test, you'll have to do more than understand a chart. You'll need to inter - pret the data. This just means that you will take the numb ers or other information provided and put them into words. It may also require you to relate one number to another, noting that it has decreased, increased, or doubled, for example. Finally, the infor - mation may require you to predict trends based on the c hart. For example, if a population chart shows 2000 2005 2010 2014 n n n - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES that the population of a country has doubled every 50 years, you might be asked what you would expect the population to be 100 years from now. If you understand what the graph is showing, you should have no trouble with these types of ques- tions. Again, familiarizing yourself with various types of graphs will help. Practice The following chart shows the price of SuperSport Sneak ers since they were introduced to the U.S. mar - ket in 1990. Review the chart and answer the question that fol lows. 22. Based on the information in the chart, you would expect the price of SuperSport Sneakers to a. increase steadily. b. increase dramatically. c. decrease somewhat. d. remain the same. Analyze How Variables, Events, or Actions Are Related The GED\u00ae test will also assess your ability to deter - mine whether different elements, events, or actions are related. Some of these questions will provide a chart or graph and ask you to make a valid conclu-sion or assess a claim regarding the impact of one var iable on another. This will require you to determine whether they are dependent or indepen-dent variables. A variable is just an object, event, idea, or other cat egory that is being measured. For example, the time at which the sun rises could be a variable. A dependent variable is a variable that changes if anothe r variable changes\u2014it is dependent upon that variable. If some factor can change a variable, it is a dependent variable. The average life expec-tancy of a country may be a dependent variable if it is co nnected to factors such as famine or war. An independent variable is an element that is not aff ected by how the values of other variables may change. For example, your age is an indepen-dent variable. At a given time, nothing changes the exa ct number of days you have been on the planet. Questions on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test may pres-ent information in a chart along with a written pas-sage. You would then be asked to determine whether one factor has influenced the other. For instance, a question may include a graph that shows a sudden increase in average life expectancy along with a pas-sage that talks about some trends in that country. You could be asked what factor or factors might have con- tributed to the change in life expectancy. Another quest ion might present a set of data and ask you to assess the validity of one or more claims, requiring you to determine whether one thing relates to another. For instance, there may be a graph showing changes in the federal budget over time coupled with a passage discussing trends in the country. You may be asked to determine whether any connections are supported by the information given. Closely related to this skill is determining cause and e ffect. This may involve determining whether one historical event led to another. A tricky part about analyzing cause and effect is that it is tempting to decide something is a cause just because it comes right before some change or effect. Often, so many 360360 - - 361361 SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES factors might contribute to a change of some sort that it is impossible to point out a single cause. The key is to think logically about the issue. Practice Read the passage and examine the chart that accom-panies it, and then answer the question that follows. World War I (1914-1918) was one of the deadliest conflicts of the twentieth century. It involved the use of modern weaponry never before used in battle. This allowed combatants to kill each other on a scale that had been impossible in earlier wars. Most of the countries involved in the war were European nations, although the United States and the Ottoman Empire were also involved. Approximately 60 million Europeans fought over the course of the war. About 9 million combatants were killed. At the same time, a global epidemic of a deadly strain of influenza known as the Spanish flu killed some 50 million people around the world.

Mean The mean is the same as the average. To nd the mean, take the values, add them up, and divide by how many values you have. n n n n n n n n n - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES Here's an example. Find the mean of the follow- ing numbers: 9, 14, 22, 11, and 10. n Add the values. The sum is 66 (9 + 14 + 22 + 11 + 10 = 66). Count up how many items or values you have added: 5. Divide the sum of the values (66) by the number of values (5), and you get 13.2 (66 \u00f7 5 = 13.2). n T he mean, or average, is 13.2. Median The median is the value in the middle of your list of values. To nd the mean, reorder the values from lowest to highest. The median will be the number in the middle. If you have an even number of values, the median will be the average of the two numbers in the middle. Let's nd the median of the following list of numb ers: 9, 14, 22, 11, and 10. First, put in order from smallest to largest: 9, 10, 11, 14, 22. Then, nd the number in the middle of the list: 11. Mode T he mode r efers to the value that occurs most fre- quently in the list. If you have a list of three numbers and o ne occurs twice, that will be the mode. In longer lists, it will again help to put the values in order. Then, it's simple! Just look for the number that occurs most often. Find the mode of the following list of numbers: 18, 12, 10, 2, 9, 6, 18, 42, 18, 2. Put in order from smallest to largest: 2, 2, 6, 9, 10, 12, 18, 18, 18, 42. Look for the number that occurs most often: there are three 18s, more than any other number. The mode is 18. Range T he range is the difference between the largest and the smallest values. Let's nd the range of the previous set of num- bers: 18, 12, 10, 2, 9, 6, 18, 42, 18, 2 The largest number is 42. The smallest number is 2. The difference between them is 40. Summary of applying Mathematical reasoning to Social Studies Keep in mind that the GED\u00ae Social Studies test is not designed to assess your computational skills, just the mathematical skills directly related to the social stud-ies discipline. You'll have access to a calculator, and social studies questions that require mathematical calculation will usually provide choices, so you will be less likely to make a computational error. Many of the question formats provide a set of answe rs from which to choose. Look at each of the answer choices to see if you can gure it out without having to do the math. For instance, a question that asks for the mean or average of a series of numbers may not require you to add up the values and then divide. You may be able to gure out the answer by using common sense. That said, one of the things that you will need to pay attention to is how numbers work. You should be able to move fairly readily between percentages and fractions, for instance. You should recognize that 1% 1is equal to ___ 100, meaning that something occurs 1 out of every 100 times. You should know that 50% is the same as one-half of something. Reviewing these basic mathematical principles, as well as the types of graphs you will likely come across, can help you focus on the content of the question that is asked. 362362 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES n n n the e xtended r esponse t ask The GED\u00ae Social Studies test includes an extended response question, also known as an essay question. You will be asked to read a passage (or a pair of pas-sages) that focuses on an enduring issue, meaning a co mplex topic that has no easy solutions. You will be expected to have some background knowledge to draw on when answering these questions. In order to understand the passage(s) you read, it will be impor - tant to understand the historical context in which they were created. About 70% of the time, the focus will be on U.S. history, civics, and government. About 30% of the time, the focus will be on world geogra-phy or economics. You will be asked to write an essay in which you analyz e the position taken by the author of each pas- sage. You will support your analysis with evidence fro m the reading passage, facts, and logical argu- ments. This kind of essay response is different from what you might have seen on other tests in the past. Often, essay questions ask you to talk about an expe-rience from your own life, respond to a general con-troversy, or make an argument in support of a gen eral idea. On the GED\u00ae Social Studies test, how- ever, the emphasis will be on your ability to analyze passages carefully and then respond to them with a well-reasoned, well-supported argument. The pas- sages you read can be pieces of primary source docu-ments, such as speeches, letters, and journal entries, or secondary source documents, such as parts of arti- cles or books about important social studies events. To score well, your essay must have a clear struc- ture and be free of grammatical and spelling errors. The re is no set minimum or maximum word limit for your essay, but plan on writing about 250 words. Overview Most of the prompts\u2014the topics you will be asked to write about in your essay\u2014will ask you to compare or evaluate the ideas, arguments, and effectiveness of a passage or two passages. This means you will have to pull together all the skills you have learned and apply them. You will need to understand the author's purpose, tell the difference between fact and opinion, and identify important parts of the passage. In general, it is best to write a three- to four- paragraph essay that follows this structure: Paragraph 1: Introduce your analysis of the passage(s) based on the prompt you are given. This paragraph can be short, but it must clearly summarize, in one or two sentences, what your analysis is. Paragraphs 2 and 3: Support your analysis in mo re detail using quotes and evidence from the passage(s). You should also draw on your knowl-edge of historical events or related issues. How-ever, try not to base your position on your own exp erience alone. You need to stay focused on the passage(s) and the prompt. You may be able to accomplish these tasks in one long paragraph. If you need two paragraphs, use the rst to explain your position and the next to discuss other posi-tions and why you do not agree with them. Paragraph 4: Conclude your argument. This can b e a brief paragraph. Restate your position and very quickly summarize your argument. When writing an essay response, follow these steps in this or der: 1. Read the prompt\u2014the topic you will have to wr ite about. This will help you focus on rele- vant details as you read the passage or passages. 2. Read the passages carefully, taking note of whe re each author makes a very strong point or a flawed point. 3. Decide how you will address the prompt. 4. Plan your essay using the basic structure explaine d earlier. Making an outline will help. Decide in advance what you will say in each paragraph and what details and facts you will use to support your statements. 363363 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES 5. Write your essay. 6. Go back and reread your essay. Make sure you hav e stayed focused on the topic. If you haven't, cut out material that is off topic. Make sure your argument is easy to follow by using care-fully chosen words that make your meaning clear and b y organizing your essay logically. Clarify your points as necessary. Make sure your punctuation, spelling, and grammar are all correct; that you use transitional words to make your ideas flow smoothly; and that you change your sentence structure from time to time to make the essay more interesting and easy to follow. eXcerPt Read the Prompt and Passage(s) Let's take a look at the following two passages and the sample prompt that follows. Your rst two steps in preparing to answer an extended response question are to read the prompt and then read the passages. On test day, you should plan on spending about 25 minutes completing these two steps. [T]his [a tax on corn sales] operates then as a tax for the maintenance of the poor.\u2014A very good thing, you will say. But I ask, Why a partial tax? Why laid on us Farmers only?\u2014If it be a good thing, pray, Messrs. the Public, take your share of it, by indemnifying us a little out of your public treasury. In doing a good thing there is both honour and pleasure;\u2014you are welcome to your part of both. For my own part, I am not so well satisfied of the goodness of this thing. I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means.\u2014I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it. In my youth I traveled much, and I observed in different countries, that the more public provisions were made for the poor, the less they provided for themselves, and of course became poorer. And, on the contrary, the less was done for them, the more they did for themselves, and became richer. \u2014Benjamin Franklin, 1766 364364 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES n n n n eXcerPt There are millions of Americans\u2014one fifth of our people\u2014who have not shared in the abundance which has been granted to most of us, and on whom the gates of opportunity have been closed. . . . The young man or woman who grows up without a decent education, in a broken home, in a hostile and squalid environment, in ill health or in the face of racial injustice\u2014that young man or woman is often trapped in a life of poverty. He does not have the skills demanded by a complex society. He does not know how to acquire those skills. He faces a mounting sense of despair which drains initiative and ambition and energy. Our tax cut will create millions of new jobs\u2014new exits from poverty. But we must also strike down all the barriers which keep many from using those exits. T he war on poverty is not a struggle simply to support people, to make them dependent on the generosity of others. It is a struggle to give people a chance. T he new program I propose is within our means. Its cost of 970 million dollars is 1 percent of ou r national budget\u2014and every dollar I am requesting for this program is already included in the budget I sent to Congress in January. But we cannot measure its importance by its cost. For it charts an entirely new course of hope for our people. \u2014President Lyndon B. Johnson, 1964 ProMPt In your response, develop an argument about how President Lyndon Johnson's position in his speech reflects the enduring issue in the excerpted letter by Benjamin Franklin. Incorporate relevant and specific information from the letter, the speech, and your own knowledge of the enduring issue and the circumstances surrounding the case to support your analysis. As you read the excerpts, you should have noted key facts and arguments made by both authors. You need to analyze each excerpt carefully (step 3 of the 6 steps for writing an extended response). Let's practice. Identify the important points and arguments\u2014 fla wed and strong\u2014made by each author. Think about how you intend to address the p rompt. Read it again carefully. Remember to stay focused on it. It is clear now that the enduring issue is what role the government should play in assisting people living in poverty. This is an issue that can produce an emotional response. Stay focused on the prompt and the passages. Y our task is to make a well-reasoned, logical argu- ment that is based on facts, not generalities or pe rsonal biases. Think of one or two clear sentences that state y our position. Everything you write in your essay response should be in support of those one or two sentences. This is your thesis statement\u2014the main idea of your whole essay. 365365 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES An example of a thesis statement for this prompt might be: ProMPt In your response, develop an argument President Lyndon Johnson makes a clear argu- ment that while giving money to the poor is not an eff ective solution to the enduring problem of poverty, the poor can be trapped in a cycle of pov-erty and the government should do what it can to break that cy cle and give the poor better opportu- nities to succeed. Benjamin Franklin argues that by no t helping the poor, the government gives them an incentive to improve their positions in life. Plan Your Essay You have a thesis statement; each individual para-graph should have a main idea, too. Those main ideas should ba ck up and develop your thesis statement with facts and quotes from the passages. After you have decided on the main idea of each paragraph, choose what facts, quotes, and personal knowledge you will use to support your main ideas. Here are some examples of main ideas for each essay paragraph accompanying the sample thesis, which would represent paragraph 1. P aragraph 2: It is p ossible to be trapped in a cycle of poverty. Paragraph 3: Handouts are still not the answer, but tearing down barriers is. Paragraph 4: Johnson had it mostly right, but Franklin raised a good point about personal responsibility. Write Your Essay Do the main ideas for each paragraph clearly support the thesis statement? Good! Now it's time to write your essay! about how President Lyndon Johnson's position in his speech reflects the enduring issue in the excerpted letter by Benjamin Franklin. Incorporate relevant and specific information from the letter, the speech, and your own knowledge of the enduring issue and the circumstances surrounding the case to support your analysis. Here is an example of an excellent response to this prompt: President Lyndon Johnson makes a clear argu-ment that while giving money to the poor is not an eff ective solution to the enduring problem of poverty, the poor can be trapped in a cycle of pov-erty and the government should do what it can to break that cy cle and give the poor better opportu- nities to succeed. Benjamin Franklin argues that by no t helping the poor, the government gives them an incentive to improve their positions in life. While the United States is a wealthy and po werful nation, a shocking number of its citizens live in poverty and do not share in the general bounty of the nation. In 2010, the U.S. Census showed 15% of Americans lived in poverty. In 1960, the situation was more dire. As Johnson said, \"There are millions of Americans\u2014one fth of our people\u2014who have not shared in the abun-dance which has been granted to most of us, and on whom the g ates of opportunity have been closed.\" These kinds of statistics did not exist for the U.S. colonies in 1766, when Benjamin Frank-lin wrote his letter. But it is safe to say that the econom y, demographics, and population size of what is now the United States were far different in the 1760s than in the 1960s. Most colonists 366366 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES n n n n n n n were focused on raising food for their own fami- lies. Some, like Benjamin Franklin, had larger farms and w ere able to sell their produce for prot, which meant they became wealthier. Franklin was not born into a wealthy family and he did indeed become the influential and wealthy person he was through his own ingenuity and hard work. It is easy to see, then, how he might feel that if he could succeed against the odds, so could any other person. That is why he could state that while he believed in helping the poor, he thought \"the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it.\" What Benjamin Franklin did not see and Jo hnson did was that not everyone has the same opportunities and tools necessary to succeed. Franklin's parents, though not wealthy, encour - aged him in his education. Franklin himself was a man of astonishing intelligence and creativity, whose achievements in everything from publish-ing to natural science to politics are unmatched. But not e veryone can be a Benjamin Franklin, and even Franklin himself could not foresee how much the United States would change over the course of 200 years. The United States had become a world superpower and industrial pow-erhouse by the 1960s. It was, as Johnson said, \"a comp lex society.\" In such a society, as Johnson said, a person \"without a decent education, in a broken home, in a hostile and squalid environ-ment, in ill health or in the face of racial injus-tice\" could become trapped in poverty. What Jo hnson wanted to do was offer paths out of pov- erty, mainly by improving educational opportu-nities and removing barriers to success, such as rac ial injustice. Franklin and Johnson seemed to agree that simpl y giving handouts to the poor is not a last- ing solution to poverty. What might have led Fr anklin to adopt his position was the fact that giving food and shelter to the poor was the com-mon practice during his day. The cost of charity to the poor was usually borne by city governments or churches. Franklin could certainly make the argument that just giving alms to the poor does little to encourage them to escape poverty. How-ever, as Johnson argued, \"The war on poverty is not a st ruggle simply to support people, to make them dependent on the generosity of others. It is a struggle to give people a chance.\" Proofread Your Essay Once you have a solid rst essay draft, reread your essay and make sure it is clear, grammatical, and free of spelling errors.

The air was so toxic that birds dropped in midflight. Air pollution was taking a toll on human health as well. Experts attributed roughly 1,000 deaths and 35,000 hospitalizations a year to the high ozone level. The city's location has contributed to its air pollution problems. The city is located on a lake basin that was originally drained in the 1600s and is 7,000 feet above sea level. There are lower levels of oxygen at higher altitudes, which causes higher emissions of carbon monoxide and other pollutants. Intense sunlight results in more smog. Since the mid-1990s, Mexican leaders have attempted to address the problem. The govern- ment required that gasoline be reformulated to remove lead. Polluting refineries and factories wer e encouraged to clean up their emissions and move away from the urban center. Public trans- portation was expanded to encourage people to drive less. Change has been gradual, but the steps taken to address Mexico City's pollution problems h ave paid off. The presence of lead in the air is just one-tenth of what it was in 1990. Dust, soot, chemicals, and other suspended particles have been cut by 70 percent. There are still gains to be made, however, and the government continues to look for ways to reduce pollution. Much of these involve greener solutions to transportation, including the expansion of the low-emissions bus system, the addition of hybrid buses, and a new suburban train system. 371371 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES 6. Based on this excerpt, how does Mexico City's lo cation contribute to its pollution problem? a. Its high altitude leads to less oxygen and g reater emissions of pollutants. b. Its tropical location leads to hotter air t emperatures and greater smog. c. Its proximity to the United States means that it d eals with excess pollution from the north. d. Its dry climate leads to more dust particles in the air . 7. According to the passage, which of the follow e vents occurred rst? a. Mexico City was named the most polluted cit y in the world. b. The lake basin on which Mexico City is lo cated was drained. c. Dust, soot, and chemicals have been reduced in M exico City's air by 70%. d. The Mexican government expanded public t ransportation to encourage people to drive less. 8.

Many, including the United States, fell into deep recessions. The crisis was triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble in the United States. In economic terms, a bubble is a rapid increase in the price of some commodity that is not related to the actual change in its value. When a bubble bursts, prices fall rapidly. In the United States, when the housing bubble burst, high real estate prices dropped. Because the mortgages, or home loans, on these pieces of real estate were tied to financial markets around the world, the sharp fall in real estate prices triggered a financial panic and severe strain on banks and government budgets. Though some countries had yet to recover fully from the crisis as of 2014, the United States had recovered substantially from the economic crisis by 2010. Despite this, the real estate markets in many urban areas continue to suffer. 12.

T his question is asking you to gure out from the details when Washington made this speech. Nothing in the speech says specically where or when it occurs, so you need to look for clues\u2014the facts or details from which you can make an inference. Return to the passage to explore how the details might give you the clues you need to gure this out. The rst clue is that Washington is addressing Friends and Citizens. This suggests that it is a speech to a larger group of people than the Continental Army (choice a) or Constitutional Convention (choice b). From the rst sentence, you learn that The period for a new election . . . [is] not far distant. You need to apply your knowledge of social studies to understand that Washington is talking about a presidential election. At the end of the para- graph, he says he wants to decline the nomina- tion. Only choices c and d have to do with p residential elections, and as you probably know well, Washington was the rst U.S. presi-dent. That means he did accept a nomination at so me point, but at the time he is giving the speech, he does not want the nomination. So the only answer choice that makes sense by log-ical inference is choice d. 2. When Christopher Columbus landed in the N ew World, he brought with him horses, cattle, and seeds for planting. Over the next decades, European explorers and settlers brought to the New World other domesticated animals and plants. Wheat and other grains soon became a staple crop in North America. Meanwhile, from the New World to the Old went corn, squash, turkeys, tomatoes, and the ever-important potato. This transfer of plants, animals, and dis- eases, known as the Columbian Exchange, t ransformed the diets and lifestyles of people on both sides of the Atlantic. 3. b. T he organization will hold its 45th annual convention in June. The annual convention is a formal assembly or gathering. 4. a. T he military government clashed with the conventions of the native peoples. The native conventions are customary ways of doing things. 5. c. One o f the reasons it can be difcult to read historical documents is that they follow differ - ent conventions from those used today. The his- torical conventions are familiar or preferred w riting styles of the times. 6. Answers will vary: The purpose of this passage is to convince lis- teners that women do not want to be domi- nated by men. 7. Fact. 8. Opinion. 9. Fact. 10. c. T his is the only hypothesis that is supported by evidence from the passage. Columbus's dis- covery led to the Spanish conquest of the New W orld and the decline of the Incan empire. 376376 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES 11. Answers will vary: Jim Blanchard is an environmentalist. He is concerned about the use of nonrenewable nat-ural resources. A ll the details in the passage describe a person who is mostly likely an environmentalist. The very rst sentence of the passage states that Blanchard \"is looking for ways to reduce his carbon footprint,\" and the remaining sentences describe his concern about use of plastic and nonrenewable natural resources such as gasoline. 12. A nswers will vary: Cattle ranches are the leading cause of defor - estation of the Amazon rain forest. W hen you look at the pie chart, the biggest slice\u2014cattle ranches\u2014should grab your attention. At 60%, it is twice as large as the next leading cause of deforestation. 13. A nswers will vary: Beef exports are projected to signicantly increase worldwide by 2015, but especially in Brazil and the United States. Looking at the bar chart, the darker bar (denoting the 2015 projections) is signicantly taller than the lighter bar (denoting beef exports in 2006) for overall worldwide beef exports. Of the individ- ual nations, the difference is most stark for Bra- zil and the United States, indicating that both nat ions make up a big chunk of that worldwide projection. 14. c. W e can condently predict, based on these charts, that a growing beef export industry in Brazil will put increasing pressure on the Ama-zon rain forest and lead to more deforestation. 15. 1. The bill is introduced to Congress. 2. The House and Senate pass different ver - sions of the bill. 3. The differences are ironed out in a Confer - ence Committee. 4. The bill returns to Congress, where it must b e passed through both houses. 5. The bill is then presented to the president. 6. The president signs the bill. 16. c. S outh Carolina complained that the North-ern states had encouraged slaves to run away and fue led servile insurrection, or slave revolts. 17. a. T he Republican Party would be most likely to cut the food stamp program in order to reduce the decit. 18. A nswers will vary: The author has expressed a bias in favor of unemployed and poor Americans and believes that helping them should be a responsibility of the wealthy. This bias is evident when the author uses prescriptive words like should. When someone says we should do something, he or she is usually about to express an idea that reveals bias. The nal sentence of the passage also shows clear bias. Strong language such as The best way\u2014perhaps the only way is also pre- scriptive and should alert you that the writer is ab out to express a strong opinion that will give you a hint about his or her bias. 19. women. The depiction of the woman rolling up he r sleeves to do work and the \"We Can Do It!\" in the poster's title indicate that the target audi-ence was women. More specically, the audi-ence was women in the United States during W orld War II, while many of the men were overseas ghting in the war. 377377 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES 20. Answers will vary: The goal of the poster was to keep production up during wartime by boosting the morale of women workers. This poster was created in 1942 by an artist named J. Howard Miller. It was a part of the Westinghouse Company's War Production Coordinating Committee's series of posters for the war effort. 21. b. I n the speech, Truth describes her life, stress- ing that her strength and abilities are equal to those o f men. By asking \"Ain't I a woman?\" she is calling on the audience to recognize that equality. 22. a. T he graph shows a steady increase in the price of SuperSport Sneakers, so you would expect this trend to continue. Note that while there are many variables that could influence this, the question is asking you only to use the information that has been provided. 23. c. T he passage states that 60 million soldiers were deployed in the war. Millions of men from each country were deployed. If the men of a country are away from their families or are killed, they clearly cannot father children. Although the question does not ask about this, note that an even deeper dip in the birth rate occurred in the 1930s and early 1940s\u2014the years of the Great Depression and World War II. Social Studies Practices Review 1. c. T he other paragraphs support Churchill's plea for supporting the war whatever the cost and the agony may be. Choice a is incorrect because although Churchill gives an update on the war, this is not the main reason he gives the speech. Choice b is incorrect because Churchill speaks of his allies, but the address is to the people of Britain; this is shown in the rst sen- tence, when he speaks of o ur country. Choice d is incorrect because although the tone is indeed solemn and respectful of those ghting for free-dom, this is not the purpose of the speech. 2. c. Ge rmany has broken through France's defenses and taken over Holland. Churchill expresses his fears and expectation that Ger - many will continue its advance toward Britain. C hoice a is incorrect because Churchill suggests that Germany is a formidable enemy, but he stresses that Britain will be able to defeat it. Choice b is incorrect because Holland has indeed been invaded by Germany, but there is nothing that indicates that it has allied itself with Germany; in contrast, Churchill equates Holland's experience with ruin and slavery. Choice d is incorrect because although Churchill mentions the alliance with France, he is poised for Britain to act alone. 3. b. C hurchill is expressing growing condence. He admits that ghting has been erce but states that the British position is much stronger than it used to be. Choices a, c, and d are incor - rect because these sentences support the main id ea but do not express the main idea. 378378 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES 4. World War II. This can be discerned by the date o f the speech\u20141940. If you did not know the specic dates of the war, you should be able to apply more general knowledge of the war and its battles to be able to correctly identify the context of this speech. 5. Nazi Germany. Using context clues should be ab le to help you discern that this term refers to the German army and tank brigade. 6. a. T he excerpt points out that the location of Mexico City at a high altitude has contributed to its air pollution problems. Choice b incorrect because although the passage mentions smog, it does not claim that the city's tropical location is responsible. Choice c is incorrect because the passage does not mention excess pollution from the United States. Choice d is incorrect the pas- sage does not mention the dry climate as an imp ortant factor in pollution. 7. b. T he second paragraph states that Mexico City is located on a lake basin that was origi- nally drained in the 1600s. Choice a is incorrect b ecause the rst paragraph of the passage says that in 1992, Mexico City was named the most polluted city in the world. Choices c and d are incorrect because they were steps the Mexican government took to reduce pollution in response to the pollution problem. 8. c. T he drop in lead pollution levels is evidence that the new policies have made a difference. Choice a is incorrect because encouraging ren-eries to clean up their emissions would not be e vidence that new policies have been effective. Choice b is incorrect because lower levels of oxygen at Mexico City's high altitudes are not the result of antipollution policies. Choice d is incorrect because future plans do not indicate evidence that existing policies have made a difference. 9. b. B ased on the cartoon, the artist most likely has a very negative opinion of Standard Oil. The cartoon suggests that Standard Oil is a monster seizing control of the land, the government, and the people. 10. a. T he cartoon is aimed at working-class read-ers in an attempt to arouse public sentiments ag ainst Standard Oil. Choice b in incorrect because the cartoon portrays Standard Oil in a negative light and therefore would not be aimed at oil industrialists. Choice c is incorrect because the cartoon suggests that politicians are already under the control of Standard Oil, and therefore politicians would not be swayed by the cartoon's message. Choice d is incorrect because although the cartoon depicts Standard Oil as an octopus, its message is not intended for marine biologists. 11. c. T he cartoon depicts Standard Oil as a cor - poration that has seized massive power and c ontrol, as did several corporate monopolies in the late nineteenth century. Choice a is incor - rect because the cartoon does not make refer - ence to the expansion of American corporations int o foreign markets. Choice b is incorrect because although petroleum extraction and production increased in the nineteenth century, the cartoon is aimed specically at Standard Oil rather than the industry as a whole. Choice d is incorrect because the cartoon does not make reference to territorial disputes between the United States and Spain. 379379 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICES 12. c. T he median is the middle house price at any given time, which gives the clearest picture of a general trend. Choice a is incorrect because the mean, or average, housing price could be pulled sharply up or down by an unusually low or high sales price, so it isn't a reliable indicator of the overall state of the housing market. Choice b is incorrect because the mode is more or less irrel- evant to the question, since it doesn't show an o verall trend. Choice d is incorrect because the range of housing prices would be not be indica-tive of a trend. 13. a. T he Preamble lists six reasons that a new governing document is needed. Choice b is incorrect because although the Preamble is at the beginning of the Constitution, it does not provide an outline of the document. Choice c is incorrect because the Constitution describes the new system of government, but the Preamble does not. Choice d is incorrect because although the causes for separating from Eng- land were very much in the minds of the au thors of the Constitution, the Preamble does not review these. 14. c. T o nd the most common reason given, look for the biggest slice of the pie, or the item with the highest percentage. The most common rea-son given was being too busy or having a con-flicting schedule, which is 19%. The next b iggest reasons given were: not interested (16%), illness or disability (14%), and did not like candidates or campaign issues (13%). 15. b. B eing too busy was cited by more nonvoters than any other reason. Providing longer polling hours might enable busy people to get to the polls. Choice a is incorrect because although this might encourage some people, only 3% of respondents suggested that they had not voted because the polling place was inconvenient. It is not the most influential factor on the list. Choice c is incorrect because although some people may benet from a reminder, only 4% of respondents suggested that they had forgotten to vote; it is not the most influential factor on the list. Choice d is incorrect because although people have to register in order to vote, the reg- istration process is not intended to be a barrier. Onl y 5% of respondents said they had registra- tion problems, so it is not the most influential fa ctor on the list. 16. a. Apath y is dened as a lack of interest or enthusiasm. The fact that, according to the chart, 16% of Americans did not vote simply because they were not interested supports this opinion. You cannot assume that a person who is too busy to vote is apathetic about politics or unappreciative of his or her right to vote. 380380 chapter14 Social StudieS Knowledge This chapter is designed to serve as a crash course in the four major social studies knowledge areas cov- ered on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test: 1. Civics and government (50% of the exam) 2. U .S. history (20% of the exam) 3.Ec onomics (15% of the exam) 4.Ge ography and the world (15% of the exam) R emember, the focus of the exam isn't to assess your social studies content knowledge; it's to test your critical reasoning and thinking skills in a social studies context. On the test, you will never encounter a question that asks you to provide your own denition of a specic social studies term or concept. However, according to the GED\u00ae Testing Service, you should be \"broadly and generally familiar\" with each of the basic social studies con-cepts covered in this chapter. In other words, to do your best, you should strive to generally understand all the conc epts and terms you'll encounter in the following pages. 381 n n n - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE There are practice questions throughout the chapter to help test your social studies comprehen- sion skills, much like the questions on the GED\u00ae So cial Studies test. Answers and explanations for all practice questions are at the end of the chapter. civics and g overnment The study of civics and government is a core compo-nent of social studies literacy. All citizens and resi-dents should understand how local, state, and federal go vernments affect their lives. This lesson will help build your: familiarity with the types of governments throughout history and around the world understanding of the historical and philosophical basis of the U.S. government and how it operates knowledge of how the U.S. political system func - t ions and shapes policy Types of Modern and Historical Governments Government is the overall structure by which nations, states, and cities carry out their political, economic, and social agendas. Many kinds of governments throughout history have shaped the types of govern-ments that exist today. Democracy Throughout most of history, political power has been rese rved for kings, dictators, and wealthy landowners. The history of democracy is the history of power being transferred from wealthy rulers to everyday people, regardless of social status, gender, race, or creed. Democracy is truly, as Abraham Lincoln stated in his Gettysburg Address, \"government of the peo-ple, by the people, for the people.\" There are four types of democracy. In a direct democracy, or pur e democracy, power is held directly by the people. In other words, the people vote directly on policies and laws rather than e lect representatives to vote for them as in the United States. In 500 B.C., the city-state of Athens became the rst direct democracy, although slaves, women, and foreigners could not vote. In modern times, Switzerland is the only example of direct democracy, and then only at the local level. On the national level, the Swiss government is representative. In a representative democracy, or indir ect democracy, the people elect ofcials to vote on pol-icy, legislate laws, and appoint other governmental ofcials, such as judges. Modern democracies, includ- ing the United States, United Kingdom, and Ger - many, are all representative democracies. Parliamentary democracy is similar to repre- sentative democracy because in both forms of gov-ernment, the people elect ofcials to represent their inte rests. However, this system is often also a consti- tutional monarchy, as in the United Kingdom and Japan, where the monarch\u2014a king, queen, or emperor\u2014is a gurehead without true political power. In this case, the head of state (a queen, for example) is different from the head of government (a prime minister, for example). In a presidential democracy o r congressional democracy, the president is both head of state and head of government, with the power to appoint and nominate government ofcials. The United States and France are modern examples of this type of dem-ocratic government. Monarchy There are two types of monarchies. An absolu te monarchy, or a despotic monarchy, is a form of gov- ernment in which a ruler, or despot, inherits power fo r life. The despot's power is absolute and not lim- ited by laws or a constitution. For example, ancient Ro man despots could put any citizen to death for any reason or for no reason at all. The despot's whim was law. In a constitutional monarchy, the monarch's p ower is limited by a constitution and the law. As 382382 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE described previously, this kind of government is often associated with parliamentary democracy, in which the king or queen has no real power and only serves as a ceremonial gurehead based on tradition. Oligarchy In an oligarchy, a small group of people controls the go vernment. There are four types of oligarchies, each with its own type of ruling class. 1. In an aristocracy, political power is in the hands of the nobility, who bear hereditary titles such as baron, duke, or count. Historically, this ruling class has been wealthy landowners enti-tled to education denied to the lower classes. The American Revolution was a rebellion against the privilege of English aristocracy and the aristocratic system. 2. A military junta is government by military lead ers. Some South American countries, including Colombia and Brazil, have been gov-erned by juntas, although juntas are not limited to that c ontinent. This type of government is often subject to a military coup d'\u00e9tat, often just called a coup, in which one military force overthrows another to gain power. 3. Plutocracy is government by the rich, and the te rm plutocrat is widely used as an insult or warning against the plutocratic state. Many social scientists have described America's Gilded Age (1870-1900) as a plutocratic era because robber-baron industrialists, such as John Jacob Astor and Andrew Carnegie, wielded political power due to the great wealth they had amassed in business. 4. In a stratocracy, the government is run by mil-itary leaders. It is different from a junta govern-ment because in a stratocracy, the military and the go vernment are sanctioned as one by a mil- itary constitution. Myanmar (Burma) is the onl y modern example of this form of oligarchy. Practice 1. Which of the following is a plutocrat? a. duke b. robber baron c. elected ofcial d. military general 2. The American Revolution a. was a coup. b. opposed oligarchy. c. supported oligarchy. d. made way for a military constitution. Authoritarianism An authoritarian g overnment is ruled by a single, absolute dictator or small group of despots whose word is law. Under authoritarianism, the people have no freedom except what is allowed by a supreme ruler. This ruler is often cruel and arbitrary because, as the saying goes, \"Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\" One form of authoritarianism is an aut ocracy, in which one person is the absolute ruler of the gov-ernment. His or her power is unlimited. For example, Kim Jong-un, the dictator of North Korea, has elimi- nated people he perceives as political enemies by hav-ing them sentenced to death and executed without tr ial. Despotism and dictato rship are two other forms of autocracy. In this type of government, the people are ruled by either a single individual or a small group of despots or dictators. The ancient Egyptian pharaohs were despots and treated their peoples like slaves. Totalitarianism is similar to autocracy in that power is controlled by a single, absolute ruler or party intolerant of dissent. For example, art is normally an instrument of free expression, but the German Nazis and Soviet Communists dictated that the techniques and subjects of art reflect their politics. They thereby controlled free expression and turned art into politi-cal propaganda in favor of their totalitarian goals. 383383 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE Practice 3. Based on the denitions covered so far in this chap ter, ________ government would be the most likely to support freedom of expression. a. a democratic b. an autocratic c. a Nazi d. a despotic Other Types of Government Political and religious philosophies throughout his-tory have shaped other forms of government besides the t ypes covered previously in this chapter. Each philosophy provides supporting reasons for the exis-tence of the type of government it justies. Anarchy is not a form of government but rather the absence of government and laws. Anarchists believe that every form of government is corrupt because people should be free to do as they please without the imposition of any type of authority or rules. Revolutions and civil wars, such as the French Revolution and Russian Civil War, are popularly described as states of lawless anarchy. In a meritocracy, individuals gain power and a dvance socially based on intellectual ability and tal- ent. For example, civil service exams are used to mea-sure a person's eligibility for employment and pr omotion. These tests, graded on merit, were rst administered by the Chinese during the Han Dynasty in 200 B.C. Today in countries worldwide, civil service exams are taken for jobs ranging from doctor to dog catcher. A republic is similar to a representative democ- racy in that power is held by the people through their ele cted ofcials and not by a monarch such as a king or queen. Rome was the rst republican empire in 753 B.C. The United States is the most successful example of a modern republic. A theocracy j usties rule by religious authori- ties such as priests based on the belief that a god or de ity is the supreme ruler of the state. Therefore, the government is controlled by those who interpret and carry out edicts and laws in the deity's name. Vatican Cit y, Iran, and Brunei are modern examples of theoc- racies. Finally, the term pupp et government is an insult directed at any government that lacks the power to control its own destiny. This kind of illegiti-mate government depends on powers outside the state to support it. For example, during World War II, Germany and Italy controlled puppet governments in Albania, Monaco, and Vichy France. Practice 4. Which form of government rewards talent? a. puppet b . republic c. theocracy d. meritocracy Principles of American Constitutional Democracy This section describes the seven key principles that helped establish and shape American democracy. Natural Rights The English political philosopher John Locke intro-duced the concept of natural rights as the right of ev ery human being to life, liberty, and property. In the United States' Declaration of Indepen- dence, Thomas Jefferson put Locke's idea into prac-tice but replaced the word pro perty with the phrase pursuit of happiness. Jefferson did not explain his rea-son for this change, but the phrase has been widely inte rpreted as a call for freedom of opportunity and not just the right to accumulate material goods. Governments are founded and maintained on the basis of the following three concepts: 1. The concept of natural r ights is the belief that people are born with inalienable rights that are not to be taken away from them. Therefore, power comes from the people. Most democra-cies are based on the principle of natural rights. 384384 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE n n n n n ___________ 2. Divine right claims that a god or deity bestows the rig ht to rule on an individual. Because this absolute power is god given, the ruler is not accountable to the people but only to that god. Many monarchies and theocracies are based on divine right. 3. Brute force is rule b y physical power. Dictators, warlords, criminal gangs, and terrorists often depend on brute force and terror to maintain their power. Constitutionalism Constitutionalism is the foundation of the govern-ment and laws of the United States. It is the set of fundamental principles and established precedents that govern a constitutional government. Constitu-tions can be written or oral. Great Britain, with a very ro bust democracy, has only an oral constitution. The U.S. Constitution is one of the oldest as we ll as one of the shortest written constitutions in effect today. Whether constitutions are long or short, written or not, they outline the accepted standards to which people and bodies of government must con-form. Practice Following are some advantages and disadvantages of a w ritten constitution. After each item, write whether it is an advantage or a disadvantage. 5. It is open to multiple interpretations. 6. It is slow to respond to social, political, and te chnological changes. ___________ 7. Laws might not align to standards of justice and human r ights. ____________ 8. The basic structure of the government, as well as the basic resp onsibilities of each component, is spelled out. _____________ 9. Individual rights are spelled out and guaran-teed. ____________ 10. The basis of laws is spelled out, providing secu-rity and predictability. _____________ 11. Rule of law protects individuals and organiza-tions. _____________ Majority Rule Majority rule is a fundamental requirement of a funct ioning democracy. It is implemented through: elections, in which leaders are elected by a major - ity of voters representative government composed of legisla - t ors, or lawmakers, answerable to voters The protection of minor ity rights is equally impor - tant. U.S. legislative bodies protect minorities' proce- dural rights, including the right to campaign to be come the majority through the voting process. Checks and Balances The U.S. Constitution provides a system of checks and balanc es that prevents one branch of the govern- ment from becoming more powerful than other br anches. The government has three branches, each with its o wn responsibilities, and each checked, or limited, by the other two branches. The three branches are: the legislative branch composed of the United Stat es Congress, which creates laws and the annual budget the executive branch, headed by the president, who executes the laws enacted by Congress the judicial branch, or courts, which interpret laws 385385 n n n n n n n n n - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE The idea that government power should be divided among three branches is called separation of powers. Practice Describe the checks and balances that are taking place in ea ch question by writing legislative, executive, or judicial in the spaces provided. Each of the three choices can be used more than once. 12. The president nominates judges to the federal cour t system, including the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court. The ________ branch checks the ________ branch. 13. The president has the power to veto laws passed b y Congress. The ________ branch checks the ________ branch. 14. Congress has the power to impeach and re move the president. The ________ branch checks the ________ branch. 15. The Supreme Court can declare laws unco nstitutional. The ________ branch checks the ________ branch. 16. Congress has the power to impeach and re move federal judges. The ________ branch checks the ________ branch. 17. Judges who are appointed for life are protected fro m being controlled by special interests or another branch of government. The ________ branch checks the ________ branch. Rule of Law The Oxford English Dictionary has dened rule of law as: The authority and influence of law in society, esp. whe n viewed as a constraint on individual and institutional behaviour; (hence) the principle whereby all members of a society (including those in government) are considered equally subject to publicly disclosed legal codes and processes. A democracy cannot function successfully without rule of law. Among other features, rule of law requires: clear, publicized laws a fair and transparent legislative process accountability of ofcials and leaders to voters free, periodic elections a free press W ithout rule of law, citizens are subject to unwar - ranted and unauthorized actions by government ofcials. Individual Rights I ndividual rights include the natural rights of life, lib- erty, and the pursuit of happiness laid out in the Dec-laration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights is the rst ten amendments to the U .S. Constitution. Unlike the rest of the Constitu- tion, which is primarily concerned with the structure and o rganization of the government, the Bill of Rights covers rights and protections to individuals, including: freedom of expression the right to a trial by jury freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures the right of an individual to practice his or her religion 386386 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE n n n n n \u00b0 n n Federalism Federalism is a form of government with a central gover ning authority as well as a more localized gov- ernment. In the United States, this is comprised of: national government, often referred to as the fed-eral g o vernment, responsible for issues of national impor tance state and local governments that deal with local issues, s uc h as the funding of public schools and nes for speeding tickets The line between federal government and state gov-ernment is not precise and changes over time. Structure and Design of the U.S. Government The structure of the U.S. government is based on the system of checks and balances between the executive, judicial, and legislative branches. Composition of the Three Branches of Government The execu tive branch is respo nsible for implement- ing and enforcing laws. It is composed of the following: pr esident, the leader of the U.S. government, resp onsible for the functioning of the govern- ment and the health and prosperity of the nation. The preside nt is assisted by a cabinet of advisers. vice president, with a formal role in two br anches. In the executive branch, the vice presi- dent takes over for the president if the president becomes incapa citated, resigns, is removed, or dies in ofce. In the legislative branch, the vice president presides over the Senate, casting a vote only in case of a tie. cabinet, composed of leaders of the executive age ncies, including: attorney general, head of the Justice Department secretary of state, head of the State Depart-ment and responsible for foreign policy \u00b0 \u00b0 secretary of defense, head of the Defense Department \u00b0 secretary of education, head of the Education Department \u00b0 secretary of commerce, head of the Commerce Department The legislative branch creates laws and consists of: n Senate: Each state is represented by two senators, regardless of the state's population, who serve staggered six-year terms. The Senate has the power to consent to treaties before their ratica-tion and to consent to or conrm appointments of Cabine t secretaries, federal judges, federal executive ofcials, military ofcers, ambassadors, and other federal uniformed ofcers. n House of Representatives: Every state has a dif-ferent number of representatives, based on the state's po pulation. New Jersey is a small state but is densely populated, allowing for 13 representa-tives. A large, low-population state such as Wyo-ming has only one representative. There are 435 voting ofcials in the House o f Representatives. The head of the House of Representatives is the Speaker of the House. The House has the ability to impeach ofcials and start nance and budget bills. The judicial branch is comp osed of nine Supreme Court justices. The head of the judicial branch is the Chief Jus-tic e of the Supreme Court.

Federal versus State Government Some powers and responsibilities are reserved for the fed eral government, some are reserved for the states, and some are shared by both levels of government, including levying and collecting taxes, issuing bonds, supporting transportation infrastructure, and regu-lating elections. In addition, the tenth amendment to the Co nstitution grants all powers not given to the federal government to the states and the people.

The amendments and their func-tions are as follows: The rst amendment protects freedom of speech, p ress, religion, peaceable assembly, and the right to petition the government. The second amendment protects the right of the p eople to keep and bear arms to maintain a well- regulated militia. The third amendment protects against quarter - ing, or housing, of troops in citizens' homes. The fourth amendment protects against unrea - so nable search and seizure. The fth amendment protects the right to due p rocess and private property and protects against double jeopardy (being tried twice for the same crime) and self-incrimination. The sixth amendment protects the right to crim- inal t rial by jury and other rights of the accused. The seventh amendment protects the right to civil trial by jury. The eighth amendment prohibits excessive bail and cruel and unusual punishment. The ninth amendment protects the rights of individuals not described in the Constitution, including the Bill of Rights. 388388 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE n n n n n n n n n The tenth amendment reserves powers not explicitly granted to the federal government to the states and people. Political Parties, Campaigns, and Elections in American Politics Political activity and policy making in the United States are organized around political parties, cam- paigns, and elections. A political party is made up of indiv iduals who organize to win elections, operate government, and influence public policy. While not described in the Constitution, political parties have played a key role since the beginning of the republic. Two-Party System: Thr oughout its history, the United States has had two major political parties, though the two parties in existence today are very dif-ferent from the two parties of 200 years ago. While ther e have been attempts to establish third parties, they have not resulted in any lasting electoral impact. Purpose of Parties: Whe n functioning properly, parties can dene and express a group's needs and wants in a way the public and political system can understand. Parties can also help in the formation of alliances of sufcient size and strength to influence and shape policy and political action. For more than 150 years, the two major political part ies have been the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. People can join any political party, including parties other than the major two. The Democratic Party generally supports gov - e rnment involvement to solve problems. Interest gr oups that tend to identify with the Democratic Party include organized labor, minorities, wom-en's and gay rights supporters, environmentalists, co nsumer advocates, immigrants, and liberals. The Republican Party overall wants to minimize the r ole of government in most affairs. Interest groups that tend to identify with the Republican Party include corporations, religious fundamen-talists, tax opponents, military supporters, and co nservatives. Elections and Voting: Elec tions and the right to vote are key elements of American democracy. In the United States, citizens who are registered to vote may vote in local, state, and federal elections. Candidates for ofces at the local, state, and fed- eral levels must periodically run for ofce. The candi-date who receives the most votes is elected to ofce. Man y state and local jurisdictions also have votes on ballot questions that relate to public policies and issues, such as education, the environment, and tax/ budgeting issues. Contemporary Public Policy In order to function, modern governments develop many policies and procedures, in addition to laws. If a policy seems reasonable and is generally accepted, it rarely receives any public attention. However, many public policies are subject to vig orous public debate. Areas of controversy can arise at any time. Some ongoing topics of dispute are: tax policy, including simplifying the tax code, w hether to raise or to cut revenues, and who should be impacted by these changes budget policy, including deciding how large a d ecit can be tolerated, spending and taxing pri- orities, and the role and obligations of the go vernment trade policy, including encouraging or discour - ag ing imports and exports and using trade as a co mponent of foreign policy defense policy, including the deployment and e quipping of armed forces, dening missions, and determining the objectives and exit strategy of military operations environmental policy, including interventions to a ddress pollution, energy, and development foreign policy, which affects not only Americans b ut also people around the world. Every foreign policy decision or action by the president or Con-gress is open to extensive scrutiny and criticism throug hout the country and from abroad. And 389389 n n n - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE because the United States is a democracy that guarantees freedom of speech, foreign policy dis-putes will continue to be a major component of the national conversation. Civics and Government Summary The concepts of self-rule and representative democ-racy have shaped the United States from its early his-tory. Colonists brought European ideas about go vernment, such as natural rights, to America. The United States' government took shape based on core principles, including constitutionalism, rule of law, checks and balances, and federalism. The Constitution of the United States of Amer - ica is the manifestation of those principles. It outlines the r elationship between the federal government and the states, the three branches of government, and the method of representative democracy that has shaped public policy from the country's founding to today. united States History An understanding of United States history is impor - tant to all U.S. citizens and residents. Understanding the hist orical roots of the country's political system and government, as well as major trends in its history, provides insight into what values have motivated the American people, their government, and businesses. Understanding American history helps shed light on how we got where we are today and helps us make sense of current events and political groups. Key Historical Documents American constitutional government, a descendant of the English system of government, has been influ-enced by ideas set forth in several important docu-ments in the history of Western Europe and the Unit ed States. Magna Carta The Magna Carta, or Great Charter, was written in 1215 in England. It was the most important docu- ment during the medieval period and limited the absolu te power and authority of the king of England. Primarily an agreement between the king and the nobility, its key provisions, among others, concerned: rights of landholders and tenants freedom of the church from the influence of the king reform of law, and the fair, nonarbitrary execu - t ion of justice Revised in the centuries that followed, the Magna Ca rta is considered the foundation of Great Britain's constitutional democracy. As well, it contains the ideals of self-rule and limitation of power that are enshrined in the founding documents of the United States. Practice 21. In the Magna Carta, we re fers to _____________. Mayflower Compact The Mayflower Compact was the rst governmental do cument written and implemented in a territory that would become part of the United States. The 41 Eng - lish male colonists on the May flower , which carried approximately 100 colonists to New England, signed the document on November 11, 1620, and agreed to: covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil Body Politick . . . And by Virtue hereof to enact, constitute, and frame, such just and equal Laws, Ordinances, Acts, Con - stitutions, and Officers, from time to time, as sh all be thought most meet and convenient for the general Good of the Colony; unto which we promise all due Submission and Obedience. 390390 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE n n n ______________________________________ ______________________________________ Practice 22. Reread the excerpt above and summarize in one o r two sentences what the colonists agreed to in the Mayflower Compact. Declaration of Independence Probably more than any other document, the Pream-ble of the Declaration of Independence encapsulates our most idealist ic aspirations. eXceRPt We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Most of the Declaration of Independence lists charges of tyranny against the king of Great Britain, which then forced the colonies to declare independence. Practice 23. What was the purpose of the Declaration of Ind ependence? a. To allow the United States to become the most po werful nation on Earth. b. To justify a revolution against the rule of Gr eat Britain. c. To establish democracy throughout the wo rld. d. To help create the conditions for the Ind ustrial Revolution. Constitution of the United States of America The Constitution describes the structure and nature of the U.S. government. It lays out the duties and responsibilities of the three branches of government and p r ovides for a system of checks and balances. Written in 1787, the Constitution was the sec- ond attempt by the 13 independent colonies to create a U nited States of America. The rst attempt, the Articles of Confederation, created a central govern-ment so weak that the new nation was paralyzed. The ke y problem was that unanimous approval of all the states was required to do almost anything. The Preamble of the Constitution establishes the purp ose of our government. eXceRPt We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Jus - tice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for th e common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America. The Constitution then addresses the legislative branch, balancing the needs of large and small states by creating a two-house Congress composed of: House of Representatives with membership base d on population, giving more power to more populous states Senate, comprised of two members from each stat e, giving equal power to less populous states The intent of this solution was to limit the po wer of the majority by encouraging compromise and protecting minority rights. The legislative article details the lawmaking abili-t ies of the Congress as well as the roles of the pr esident and vice president. 391391 n n n n n n n - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE The impeachment process is also described, with the House of Representatives having the responsi-bility of impeaching, or charging, a government ofcial and the S enate having the responsibility of conducting the impeachment trial. T his section of the Constitution also stipulates that the Co ngress has the power to declare war. Next, the Constitution addresses executive powers . The rst executive section declares that the presi- dent is the head of the executive branch. It describes the election of the president, with ea ch state appointing electors equal in number to the total of its members of the House and Sen-ate\u2014a system referred to as the electoral college. Each state can decide how its electors are sele cted. Most states have a system in which the presi- dential nominee who wins the most votes in the state ge ts all the electoral votes; however, that is not always the case. Twice in American history, the candidate who lost the popular vote, which is the total vote count, won the electoral vote and became president. The remaining executive powers include being c ommander in chief of the armed forces, appointing executive ofcials and judges with the advice and consent of the Senate, entering into treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate, and overseeing the executive branch. The third branch of government is described in the j udicial powers article of the Constitution. It provides for a Supreme Court and gives Con- g ress the power to create lower courts. This section also details the scope of the federal judiciary. T he next article describes state protections. These include the requirement that each state and the f ederal government respect the laws, records, and judicial proceedings of any other state, the process of admitting new states, and the federal commitment to protect states from attack. Finally, there are articles that lay out procedures fo r amending the Constitution and that commit the United States to repay all debts incurred before the ratication of the Constitution. Only nine states were required to sign for the Constitution to go into effect, but all 13 states signed. As part of that agreement, Congress and the states approved the rst ten amend-ments to the Constitution, known collectively as the Bil l of Rights. In the more than 200 years since then, there have been only 17 additional amendments. Emancipation Proclamation andReconstruction Amendments T he Civil War was the cauldron through which the Unit ed States addressed the most pressing issue of its early history\u2014slavery. The Emancipation Proclama- tion and Amendments XIII, XIV, and XV to the U.S. C onstitution (known as the Reconstruction Amend- ments) addressed slavery and would begin to heal the injust ice of slavery in the United States. The Emancipation Proclamation, which freed the sla ves who lived in the Confederacy, was issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863. It referred to a preliminary version issued in September 1862, which stated: 392392 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE eXceRPt At the conclusion of the Civil War, amendments were ratied that resolved the conflict over slavery, including:That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the free- dom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom. After listing the states and parts of states still consid- ered to be in rebellion and repeating the announce-ment of the abolition of slavery in rebellious areas, the Pr oclamation continued: eXceRPt And I hereby enjoin upon the people so declared to be free to abstain from all vio - lence, unless in necessary self-defence; and I r ecommend to them that, in all cases when allowed, they labor faithfully for reasonable wages. And I further declare and make known, th at such persons of suitable condition, will be received into the armed service of the United States to garrison forts, positions, stations, and other places, and to man ves-sels of all sorts in said service. And upon this act, sincerely believed to be an act of justice, warranted by the Con- stitution, upon military necessity, I invoke th e considerate judgment of mankind, and the gracious favor of Almighty God. n Amendment XIII, abolishing slavery in the United States n Amendment XIV, guaranteeing the rights of citi-zens, due process, and equal protection under the law for all people n Amendment XV, guaranteeing citizens the right to vote, regardless of \"race, color, or previous con- dition of servitude\" D espite their passage, it would take decades before the c hildren of slaves would gain access to equal rights. Prehistory to Revolutionary and Early Republic Periods The history of the United States can be traced to the earliest inhabitants of the country, but conflict with early settlers and disease introduced by them deci-mated Native American populations. By the time the Unit ed States was established, colonists faced their own conflicts over freedom and civil liberties with Great Britain, which ruled much of the eastern sea-board of North America. After the American Revolu-tion, the new nation gradually established its political ide ntity and economic independence, fueled largely by the early growth of the Industrial Revolution. Native Americans The original inhabitants of North America populated the e ntire continent before European settlement began. The ancestors of the original inhabitants of the Americas arrived from Asia. Their arrival date has not been exactly determined, but estimates range from about 40,000 to 20,000 years ago. Native Ameri-can, or Indian, peoples settled North America and fo rmed societies and nations in many regions, including: 393393 n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE Iroquois and Algonquian in the Northeast Creek, Cherokee, and Seminole in the Southeast Arapaho, Blackfoot, Sioux, Cheyenne, and C omanche on the Plains Hopi, Zuni, and Yuna in the Southwest Paiute and Shoshone in the Great Basin Hupa, Shasta, and Salina in California Chinook, Nez Perce, and Tlingit on the North- w est coast and plateau These nations and tribes are only a small portion of the man y Native American societies settlers encoun- tered after Columbus arrived in the New World in 1492. The encounters between Native Americans and earl y colonists shaped the formation of the early United States. Native Americans, who passed on their understanding of the environment and resources to the colonists, numbered approximately 25 million people, according to Howard Zinn in A People's His- tory of the United States. These numbers would dwin-dle as contact with European settlers, disease, and co nflict took their toll. In addition, nearly all Native Americans were driven from their lands as Europeans colonized the continent and established control from the Atlantic to the Pacic. Causes of the American Revolutionary War While a number of European nations were involved in c olonizing the Americas, the area that would become the United States in 1783 was under the con-trol of Great Britain after the end of the French and Indian War, which was part of the larger Seven Years' War fought in Europe from 1754 to 1763. The war left the British government with crushing debt, which it tried to reduce in part by taxing its colonies in North America. British attempts to assert control and raise mone y, outlined next, were met by erce opposition from their colonies. The Proclamation of 1763 prohibited settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. The 1764 Currency Act attempted to stop the col - o nies from printing their own currency. The 1764 Sugar Act taxed sugar. The 1765 Stamp Act required tax stamps on many documents. The 1765 Quartering Act forced homeowners to let British soldiers stay in their homes. The 1767 Townshend Revenue Act increased taxes on glass, paper, and tea. 1773 Tea Act enforced taxes on tea and the British East India Company's monopoly on its sale. T hese measures were ercely opposed by the Com- mittees of Correspondence, local groups of legislators who began organizing in 1764. By 1772, the Commit- tees had become an established method of coordinated ac tion among colonies when Samuel Adams organized the Boston Committee of Correspondence. The Boston Tea Party in 1773 was one of the most imp ortant protests against the British measures, in which the Sons of Liberty boarded a merchant ship loaded with tea and dumped it into Boston Harbor. In response, the British enacted what came to be known as the 1774 Intolerable Acts, which attempted to punish the colonists by banning town meetings and closing Boston Harbor. Instead of intimidating the colonists, these ac tions estranged the colonial leadership from Great Britain and led inexorably to the outbreak of hostili-ties, which started with the following events: the \"shot heard round the world\" at the Battle of L exington and Concord on April 19, 1775, between the British and the Massachusetts Minutemen the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775, con- sid ered the beginning of the American War for Ind ependence the British evacuation of Boston in March 1776 394394 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE n n n n n n n n n n The Committees of Correspondence had estab- lished the Continental Congress to act on behalf of all colo nists in 1774. The First Continental Congress (1774) consisted of representatives from 12 colonies. The Second Continental Congress (1775-1781) comprised representatives from 13 colonies. T he Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Je fferson and approved by the Continental Congress, was adopted in 1776. The Continental Congress was the government of the United States until the U.S. Constitution was ratied in 1789. George Washington and Independence George Washington led the colonists in the War for Ind ependence against Great Britain (1775-1783). Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States in the Peace of Paris Agreement on Sep-tember 2, 1783. The rst president of the United States, Wash- ington was the rare national leader who, after a period of great service to his nation, voluntarily gave up power. Washington voluntarily retired twice, rst as c ommander in chief of the Continental Army after the military victory in the War for Indepen-dence, and later after serving two terms as pr esident. The tradition that he created was so strong that o nly one president in U.S. history\u2014Franklin Del- ano Roosevelt in the twentieth century\u2014has ser ved more than two terms, a limitation that today is formalized as the 22nd amendment to the United States Constitution. Louisiana Purchase Spain controlled Louisiana in 1799, but it agreed in 1800 t o give it to France, which was ruled by Napo- leon Bonaparte. Napoleon was convinced that war with Great Britain was coming and that France could not d efend the vast Louisiana Territory from the Brit- ish who might invade from Canada. The French then off ered to sell the entire territory to the United States. The Louisiana Purchase, completed in 1803, res ulted in: doubling the size of the United States vast expansion of resources under U.S. control encouragement of westward expansion War of 1812 T he War of 1812 helped solidify American indepen- dence from Great Britain. Leading up to the war, the British tried to restrict A merican trade and forced American seamen to join the British Navy. For the British, these were small maneuvers to help in their ongoing war with Napoleon's France. For the United States, these actions were a major attack on its sovereignty. During the war, the United States unsuccessfully t ried to invade Canada. But only after the defeat of Napoleon were the British able to attack the United States, which they did in 1814, burning Washington, D.C. Other British attacks all failed, most memorably the unsuccessful assault on Bal-timore, which inspired the national anthem, \"The Star-Spang led Banner.\" Because of vast distances and limitations on com-m unications at the time, the nal battle of the war, the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815, was actually fought after the signing of the peace treaty ending the war. The War of 1812 was the last armed conflict between the Unit ed States and Great Britain or Canada. The Industrial Revolution During the Revolutionary War and early republic peri - ods, another revolution was gathering mome ntum. 395395 n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE The Industrial Revolution, which began in Great Britain, was spreading to the United States by the late 1700s and was beginning to fundamentally change the lives of virtually all Americans. Key to this revolu-tion was a spirit of innovation and experimentation that tr ansformed manufacturing textiles transportation power generation agriculture B enjamin Franklin was probably the country's great- est and most versatile eighteenth-century inventor, hav ing invented the Franklin stove, lightning rod, and bifocals. A social innovator as well, Franklin is also credited with creating the rst mail-order catalog. While key inventions such as the power loom and the railroad were developed in Great Britain, the United States was also a center of innovation. Because early American industrialization fo cused on water-powered textile factories in the Northeast, early American inventions included the cotton gin, re hydrant, and steamship. The list of new processes and products acceler - ated through the mid-nineteenth century. Morse co de and the telegraph transformed communication, while the steamship and the railroad transformed transportation. By the end of the nineteenth century, many of the c omponents of modern life were already in place, including these inventions: telephone electric lightbulb automobile steel vacuum cleaner escalator paper bag typewriter phonograph photography skyscraper A nd there were thousands of other technological innov ations as well. The era of these material advances in the United States and Western Europe coincided with the devel- opment of democratic rule and the capitalist system of production and distribution. While the Industrial Revolution led to the greatest increase in wealth in recorded history, inequality and exploitation of work-ers were constant challenges. Civil War and Reconstruction The greatest challenge and trauma ever to face the United States was the Civil War. It was rooted in slav-ery and the reliance of Southern states on plantation agr iculture. In addition to wrenching the nation apart, the Civil War was also one of the rst major wars of the industrial age. The new weapons created for this war, including rifle-barrel shotguns and repeating rearms, in addition to the mass produc-tion of war mat\u00e9riel and equipment, introduced an unpr ecedented level of carnage. The deep-seated ani- mosity between the North and South, the loss of life, and the devastation of land and economic livelihoods would affect the country for decades. Economic Causes of the Civil War During the late 1700s and early 1800s, the United States expanded its territory. In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson doubled the size of the country by buying land from France through the Louisiana Pur - chase. Under President James Monroe, westward expansio n continued. Despite this growth and the country's increased wealth, economic and cultural differences between regions developed. Sectionalism\u2014each section of the country sup- porting its own self-interests instead of the nation's interests\u2014took root. The Northeast relied on an industrial economy while the South had an agricul- 396396 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE tural economy supported by slave labor. One major issue concerned whether new states in the Union would become free states or allow slavery. Slavery and States' Rights Cotton was a very labor-intensive crop. Southern plantatio ns dealt with their labor needs by using slaves, who were originally from sub-Saharan West Africa. Opposition to slavery came from several sources. n While the Southern economy depended on slave labor, slavery had become a moral issue in Europe as well as in the United States. n Slavery was abolished in Great Britain and most of the British Empire in 1833, and by the end of the decade to follow, Britain abolished slavery throughout the rest of its empire. I n the United States, the abolitionist movement against slavery on both moral and practical grounds spread across the Northern states, all of which had abolished slavery by the middle of the nineteenth century. At the end of the previous century, over 90% of slaves in the United States had lived in the South. The Southern states increasingly perceived their influence waning and their way of life threatened. To protect that way of life, states' rights became a focus of the South's opposition to the federal government and the North's rising opposition to slavery. Southern politicians advocated for the right of individual states to overrule federal law or ultimately to secede from the Union. The Civil War The Civil War began shortly after Abraham Lincoln, who opposed slavery, was elected president in 1860 even though he was not on the ballot in ten Southern states. Lincoln and his Republican Party were espe-cially against the expansion of slavery into the west-ern territories. In February 1861, seven states seceded from the Unit ed States and formed the Confederate States of America: South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, and Tennessee. On April 12, 1861, Confederate soldiers opened re on Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, and the Civil War began. Shortly after, four additional states declared their secession and were admitted to the Confederacy: Virginia, North Carolina, Louisiana, and Texas. The war ended in 1865 after the surrender of Ro bert E. Lee, the most important general of the Confederacy. Four million slaves were freed during the period of Reconstruction that followed the war. Five days after the Northern victory, President Lin-coln was assassinated by a Confederate sympathizer. Rese ntment and division between the South and North were not resolved for decades after the war's end. At least 750,000 people were killed in the Civil War , according to some recent estimates. This was the highest number of Americans ever killed in one con-flict and the largest and bloodiest war between the defe at of Napoleon and the beginning of World War I. Postwar Reconstruction The Civil War resulted in major destruction of the So uth. The period after the war, in which the South started the rebuilding process, was called Reconstruction . At rst, it appeared that Southern states would adj ust to the end of slavery, and former black slaves would be integrated into all aspects of civil and polit-ical life, especially once the right to vote was granted to black men through the ratication of the 15th amendment of the Constitution. By the end of the nineteenth century, Recon- struction had failed. Even though each former Con-federate state had been readmitted to the Union, bla cks were treated as second-class citizens, without 397397 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE the right to vote and segregated from the white popu- lation. This oppression was legalized by restrictive reg- ulations known as Jim Crow laws, which restricted the civil rights of blacks through limitations on vot-ing rights and a \"separate but equal\" policy regarding ed ucation, employment, and other issues. Southern states oppressed black populations and w ould not begin to recover economically and repair their fractured social structures for decades to come. Northern states, while less overtly, would con-tinue to restrict the rights of their black citizens as we ll. Civil Rights and Women's Rights While the modern Civil Rights movement is generally considered to have extended from the 1950s to the 1970s, the struggle for equal rights for African Ameri-cans stretched back to the abolitionist movement be fore the Civil War and the passage of the 13th and 14th amendments to the U.S. Constitution after the war. The history of women's rights in the United States began with the women's suffrage movement, which achieved the vote for women in 1920. Women and supporters of women's rights continue to work for complete parity of women with men\u2014economi-cally, politically, and socially\u2014and while full equality has not be en achieved, great strides have been made. The ght for women's rights stretches back throug h U.S. history. The struggle for the right to vote, for instance, began to crystallize in the middle of the nineteenth century, and equal pay for equal work is still an issue being fought on many fronts. Separate but Equal The heart of the Civil Rights movement was the str uggle against segregation, which had been upheld by the Supreme Court at the end of the nineteenth century in Plessy v. Ferguson. In 1892, Homer Plessy sat in a whites-only rail- road car in Louisiana, challenging the state's 1890 Se parate Car Act, and was arrested when he refused to move to the car reserved for African Americans. Plessy appealed his case to a Louisiana state court, but Justice John Howard Ferguson ruled against him, holding that the state had the right to regulate rail-road operations within its state boundaries. Plessy appealed his case to the U.S. Supreme Cour t, arguing that separate public accommodations led to unequal treatment in opposition to the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guaran-teed equal rights and protection under the law for all citiz ens. In a seven-to-one decision, handed down in 1896, the Supreme Court upheld Louisiana's action, in effect enshrining separate but equal for decades to come. From the beginning, se parate but equal proved impossible in reality. Throughout the South, public accommodations for blacks were inferior to those reserved for whites. And while more overt in the South, segregation existed in the North and West, as well. Seeds of the Civil Rights Movement The Civil Rights movement is rooted in the early twe ntieth century. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Booker T. Washington tried to convince black leaders to support conciliation toward whites. In 1905, led by W.E.B. Du Bois, the more mili- tant Niagara movement articulated the goals of the Ci vil Rights movement and claimed \"every single right that belongs to a freeborn American, political, civil and social; and until we get these rights we will never cease to protest and assail the ears of America.\" In 1909, Du Bois and other Niagara movement memb ers joined with sympathetic whites to form the National Association for the Advancement of Col-ored People (NAACP), which for more than a cen-tury has been a leader in the Civil Rights movement. 398398 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE Fighting for Rights The success of the Civil Rights movement was incre-mental, but advances gathered steam in the middle of the twe ntieth century. In 1947, Jackie Robinson became the rst black man in the century to play major league baseball, starting the integration of professional sports. In 1948, President Truman ended segregation and inte grated the U.S. armed forces. In 1954, NAACP lawyer Thurgood Marshall co nvinced the U.S. Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education [of Topeka, Kansas] to end separate but equal schools in Topeka. This essentially overturned Plessy v. Ferguson and made segregation illegal throughout the United States. In 1955, Rosa Parks challenged the segregation of buses in Montgomery, Alabama, by refusing to give up her seat to a white man. Her action inspired the Montgomery bus boycott, in which blacks refused to ride the buses unless segregation rules were abol-ished, and a year later, segregation was abolished. In 1957, the city school board and supervisor in Little R ock, Arkansas, had a plan to integrate Little Rock High School. However, when the governor of the state resisted, President Eisenhower sent in National Guard troops to enforce the desegregation order. Five years later, in 1962, when the University of Mississip pi was integrated, President Kennedy sent 5,000 troops to maintain order and allow James Mer - edith to attend classes. In 1963, leaders of the Civil Rights movement org anized the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom to rally for civil rights. On August 28, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech to 200,000 to 300,000 people gathered on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., in a massive nonviolent political demonstration to end racism. eXceRPt FRoM MaR tin lutHe R King'S \"i HaVe a dR eaM\" SPeecH I say to you today, my friends, that in spite of the difficulties and frustrations of the moment, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal.\" I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at a table of br otherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a desert state, sweltering with the heat of injustice and oppression, will be transfor med into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. Ratied in 1964, the 24th amendment to the Consti- tution abolished poll taxes in federal elections. These taxes were previously used across the South to disen- franchise black voters. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibited dis- crimination of all kinds based on race, color, religion, or national origin and addressed segregation in pub-lic accommodations, schools, and the workplace. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibited all states from instituting qualications, procedures, and regulations for voting that resulted in discrimination against anyone of any race or color. 399399 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE Practice 24. As you learned earlier in this chapter, in the 1896 case P lessy v. Ferguson, the Supreme Court found that segregation was legal based on the principle of separate but equal. Plessy, who was one-eighth black, had been arrested when he refused to leave a whites-only railroad car. The Supreme Court upheld his conviction. In the 1954 case Brown v. Bo ard of Education, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that \"separate but equal\" schools were not achiev-able, and that they were unconstitutional since they v iolated the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment, adopted in 1868. The most likely reason for this reversal was: a. Nearly 60 years' experience showed that separ ate cannot be equal. b. Court membership had changed from co nservatives to liberals. c. The 1896 case was about transportation whe reas the 1954 case was about education. d. The equal protection clause of the 14th amendme nt was not in effect in 1896. Women's Suffrage The struggle for women's suffrage began in the mid-dle of the nineteenth century and would stretch into the sec ond decade of the next century. In 1848, Elizabe th Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott organized the rst women's rights convention in American history, the Seneca Falls Convention, which took place in Seneca Falls, in the Finger Lakes region of Upstate New York. Written by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and signed by 100 delegates of the convention, the Declaration of Sentiments closed with the following remarks: eXceRPt Now, in view of this entire disfranchisement of one-half the people of this country, their social and religious degradation\u2014in view of the unjust laws above mentioned, and because women do feel themselves aggrieved, oppressed, and fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights, we insist that they have immediate admission to all the rights and privileges which belong to them as citizens of these United States. A few years later, Susan B. Anthony emerged as another major leader of the suffrage movement. Anthony joined forces with Stanton and other suf-frage leaders in forming the National Women's Suf-frage Association (NWSA) in 1869. In 1890, the NWSA merged with the more mod- erate American Women Suffrage Association, creat-ing a wider political umbrella that would lead the str uggle for voting rights to all states of the union. By the end of the nineteenth century, some west ern states, as well as some countries around the world, had given women the right to vote. The pace of the spread of suffrage increased in the early twenti-eth century. In the United States, the nal triumph of the suffr age movement occurred in 1920 when the 19th amendment guaranteed women the right to vote. Women's Rights after World War II Winning the right to vote was only one step in the journe y for women to achieve full equality. The mod- ern women's movement has been concerned with issues o f health, sexuality, work, and education. Women rst moved into the manufacturing wo rkforce in large numbers during World War II. Rosie the Riveter became a cultural icon of the United States, representing the six million women 400400 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE who were employed during the war years. These women took the places of male workers who were away ghting the war. Rosie the Riveter heralded women's economic power to come. The 1950s are remembered as an era when wo men retreated to traditional roles, but many women were unhappy in their limited role as house-wives. In 1963, Be tty Friedan's The Feminine Mys- tique discussed the seeming paradox of women having husbands, children, and material things yet being unhappy and unfullled. She made the case that the life of a housewife was not enough and for many women, education and a career were crucial for a complete life. In 1966, Friedan was one of the founding mem- bers of the Nat ional Organization for Women (NOW), which became the leader of the women's movement. In 1960, the release of the birth control pill helped give women autonomy and allowed them to plan their reproductive lives in ways that might enhance their economic and social well-being. In 1973, in Ro e v. Wade, the Supreme Court legalized abortion, giving women additional control over their choices. However, this decision has stirred up great controversy and opposition, especially among political conservatives and people of certain religious afliations. In 1967, women earned 58 cents for every dollar a man earned for the same work. By 2012, that num- ber had grown to 77 cents for each dollar\u2014an impr ovement, but still a long way from equality. By the end of the 1970s, for the rst time there we re more women than men in college. But women are still underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. One positive development has been the passage of Title IX legislation in 1972, which created equal opportunities for women in college athletics, includ-ing more scholarships. Women have made steady progress in the politi- cal arena on local, state, and national levels. Many local and state ofcials are women, as are judges at all levels, including the Supreme Court, and women continue to win more elections as time goes by. Immigration Millions of immigrants from foreign shores have made the journey to the Americas since Columbus's rst voyage in 1492. The bulk of these immigrants have been of European origin. In what is now the eastern United States, immigrants came from the British Isles, the Netherlands, France, and other nations of northern Europe. But in recent years, immigrants from Latin America have made up a large portion of the immigrant population. Many have set-tled in adjacent states, such as California, Arizona, and Te xas. Early Waves of Immigration Following the settling of the United States by colo-nists from Great Britain, France, and the Netherlands, other immigrants soon followed, including large groups of Germans, Swedes, and others. The rst great wave of poor immigrants to the Unit ed States came from Ireland as a response to the Irish Potato Famine in 1845-1849. Since potatoes were the sole source of food for most poor Irish, many starved in Ireland. Over one million came to the United States. n Unlike other immigrants, Irish immigrants mostly stayed in the cities, where they were dis-criminated against and exploited. n Being the rst major group of Roman Catholics to immigrate to the United States, they faced erce religious discrimination. 401401 16,000 14,000 12,000 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000 2,000 0 Estimated Produce(in thousands of tons) Yield (in kg per acre) Acreage (in thousands of statute acres) 1844 18451846 1847 1848 1849 1850 185118521853 1854 18551856 1857 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE In response to their poor treatment, the Irish became Practice involved in politics. Tammany Hall in New York City and the long reign of Mayor James Michael Curley in Boston became synonymous with corruption and patronage. In 1928, Al Smith, the rst Roman Catho-lic of Irish origin to run for U.S. president, was soundl y defeated. Thirty-two years later, John F. Ken- nedy, a descendent of poor Irish immigrants, became pr esident of the United States. After the end of the Civil War, the United States ent ered a period of rapid industrial growth. Millions of workers were needed, and the development of steam transport made the voyage across the Atlantic possible for the masses arriving from Europe. Mil-lions of immigrants flooded into America. Many came fr om southern and eastern Europe and included Italians, Jews, Poles, and other ethnic groups. Chinese immigrants arrived in signicant numbers on the West Coast.

The Gilded Age, Labor Movement, and Progressive Era The era of industrialization following the Civil War is calle d the Gilded Age, or the age of the robber barons, named after the ruthless group of industrialists and nanciers who made great fortunes controlling monopolies in commodities, transportation, and banking. Rapid industrialization and innovation created so m uch new wealth that, even with plundering by robber barons and the influx of the new immigrants, the country's wealth grew and the population nearly doubled. The excesses of the Gilded Age helped spur the de velopment of the labor movement, which was embraced by many new Americans. The rst truly national labor union, the Knights o f Labor, formed in 1869 and reached a peak of 700,000 members in 1886, when the group was blamed for deadly riots at the Haymarket in Chi-cago. The anti-union backlash that followed the ev ent led to the collapse of the Knights of Labor. The American Federation of Labor (AFL) f ormed later that year. While the Knights had been a single national union with membership that inc l uded craftsmen and unskilled workers, the AFL was a federation of individual craft unions. In 1905, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW ) was formed and followed a single union model similar to the Knights of Labor model. The IWW tended to be more militant and radical than the AFL. After peaking at 40,000 members in 1923, the IWW declined in numbers and influence. The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) was f ormed in 1938, when ten unions left the AFL. The new organization wanted to organize workers by industry rather than by craft. The CIO rejoined the AFL to form the AFL-CIO in 1955. I nstability in the labor movement has continued. The Unit ed Auto Workers left the AFL-CIO in 1968 and returned in 1981. Other unions led by the Teamsters left in 2005 to form the Change to Win Coalition. The excesses of the robber barons helped pro- voke calls for reform that became known as the pro- g ressive era. Progressives believed that, in the face of rampant poverty, education and adequate housing for the poor as well as fair labor practices and safe workplaces were necessary. Political cartoonist Thomas Nast and socially conscious photographer Jacob Riis helped stoke public anger over corruption and the terrible living conditions in American cities with the images they created. 403403 - - 404SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE 404 Practice Use the graph to answer questions 28 and 29.

The country's isolationist tendencies gave way to involvement in both World War I and World War II, and this shaped U.S. history in pro- foundly new ways. Following the second global war, the United States became the most powerful nation in the world, as it emerged relatively unaffected by the carnage and destruction of the war. World War I World War I (1914-1918) involved 32 countries, including many European nations, the United States, and other nations around the world. By the war's end, almost 10 million soldiers had been killed and more than 20 million wounded. The assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne by a Serbian nationalist was the immediate cause of the war, but conflicts between European nations over territory and economic power were also factors. Two coalitions of European nations formed. The Central Powers included Austria-Hungary, Ger-- - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n many, Bulgaria, and Turkey. The Allies included Great Britain, France, Serbia, Russia, Belgium, and Italy. World War I was the most destructive and deadly war the world had seen up to that time: 8,528,831 were killed. 21,189,154 were wounded. An additional 7,750,919 were either prisoners or missing. M any losses came as a result of trench warfare, when poiso n gas was used as a weapon. The Treaty of Versailles, signed on June 28, 1919, e nded World War I with the complete defeat of Germany and Austria. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was dismantled, and Ge rmany was humiliated with the loss of ter - ritory, onerous war reparations, and prohibitions against re militarizing. With the stock market crash of 1929, the resulting h yperinflation destroyed the value of German currency, and the worldwide Great Depression followed. The German economy was devastated, leaving the peo ple ready for a radical answer to their problems, so they elected Adolf Hitler and his National Socialist Party. The Nazis made sure that the German people never got the opportunity to vote while they were in power. World War II In World War II, three ideologies\u2014democracy, fas-cism, and communism\u2014clashed in a worldwide strug gle. Two powerful alliances, the Allies and the Axis, fought to control vast areas of the planet. Two dominant democracies, the United Kingdom and F rance, led the Allies in Europe and would later be joined by the Soviet Union and the United States. The European fascist nations of Italy and Ger - man y formed the Axis alliance, along with Japan in East Asia. T he war began focused on German aggression in Euro pe and soon spread as Italy and Japan joined forces with Germany, and England and France declared war on Germany. The war began in 1939, when Germany invaded P oland. In the rst two years of the war, the Axis powers sw ept through Europe and conquered large areas of East Asia and the Pacic. During the Battle of Britain in 1940, the United K ingdom stood alone against the Axis powers and withstood brutal aerial bombardment. With victory in their sights, Germany and Japan ma de two major mistakes. Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, and Japan attacked the United States in 1941. Then the world's largest communist state and the world's largest democ-racy joined the war on the side of the Allies. With Soviet victory over the Nazis at Stalingrad in F ebruary 1943, the Axis retreated from east Europe. The Americans and British had major naval vic- t ories in 1943 and 1944 against the Japanese in the Pacic islands. After a drawn-out conflict, the Allies took North A frica, driving out the Axis forces in 1943. The Allies invaded Europe, rst through Italy in 1943, and later through France, notably on June 6, 1944, with the D-Day invasion of northern France. The Allies also developed air superiority and b ombed areas throughout Germany. The greatest destruction was to the city of Dresden, which was completely destroyed by rebombing in February 1945. The Allies accepted the unconditional surrender o f the Axis powers on May 8, 1945. 405405 n - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE The Japanese surrendered to Allied forces on August 14, 1945. The United States developed the most destructive weap on ever created, the atomic bomb, and dropped one on the Japanese city of Hiroshima and another one on Nagasaki. Although those bombings led to the Japanese surrender, the death and devastation were so extreme that to this day it is debated whether the atomic bombs ever should have been used. While a number of nations currently have nuclear weapons, no atomic bombs have been used since World War II. World War II was possibly responsible for a gr eater loss of life than any other event in human his- tory, with total deaths estimated to have been between 60,000,000 and 85,000,000. One of the most horric aspects of this carnage was the targeting of innocent civilians by the Nazis. The Nazis imprisoned, tortured, starved, and mur - dered millions of people, including gypsies and homose xuals, but their main target was Jews. The persecution, enslavement, torture, and murder of millions of Jews is known as the Holocaust. The attempt to destroy an entire people was given a name, genocide. After the war, prominent surviving Nazis were put on trial at Nuremberg in Germany and con-victed of genocide. After the war, the United States tried an app roach to peace with the defeated Axis powers that was very different from the Treaty of Versailles, which was the punitive peace treaty imposed on Germany after World War I. Instead of assessing reparations and humiliating Germany, the United States imple-mented the Mar shall Plan. The plan provided eco- nomic assistance to all of Western Europe, including fo rmer Axis countries Germany, Italy, and Austria. Economic assistance was provided to Japan as well. The aid given to Western Europe helped the entire region recover and start the process of integration that has led to the formation and development of the European Union. And nations that once were adver - saries of the United States are now among its closest frie nds and allies. The Cold War The end of World War II left the United States and the Soviet Union as the two most powerful nations on Earth. Each nation felt threatened by the other and began a struggle\u2014based on their conflicting ide-ologies\u2014that involved many regions of the world. Democracy versus Totalitarianism The Soviet Union was a totalitarian society run as a one-par ty state. While the Communist Party was supposedly the highest authority, its secretary, Joseph Stalin, ruled as an absolute dictator. He was respon-sible for the deaths of millions of Soviet citizens but was ne ver held accountable for his crimes. Economi- cally, in the communist system all property belonged to the state, including the means of production. In practice, this resulted in a top-down command econ-omy where Soviet bureaucrats decided what would and would not b e produced. The United States is a democracy. Two major part ies and other smaller and local parties vie for political influence. The United States embraces capi-talism, a system in which a country's trade and indus-try are controlled by private owners operating in a fre e market. International Conflict in the Postwar Era As World War II ended, Western Europe was occu-pied by the democratic Allied countries while Eastern Eur ope was occupied by the Soviet Union, which imposed Communist governments and economies throughout the region. Winston Churchill, Britain's prime minister dur ing World War II, referred to the ideological boundary between democratic and communist states as the Iron Curtain. Feeling threatened by the Soviet 406406 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE Union, the United States and its allies formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). In response, the Soviet Union created a military alliance called the Warsaw Pact with the communist nations of Eastern Europe. Following the war's end, President Harry S. Tru man established the Truman Doctrine in 1947. The doctrine set U.S. policy concerning engagement with the rest of the world, promising political, eco - nomic, and military support to any country that mi ght come under internal or outside threat from authoritarian forces. Under the doctrine, the United States proclaimed a new interventionist approach, which was a turnaround from its previous isolation - ist foreign policy. While the United States and the Soviet Union assemb led the most powerful arsenals that had ever existed, with hundreds of lethal missiles pointed at each other, none of these weapons were ever used in direct conflict. As a result, this period was known as the Cold War, a war of tension and rivalry but never direct combat. The two powers were involved in many conflicts acr oss the globe, which often stood as proxies for their own ideological conflict with each other. The United States also openly fought communism in Korea and Vietnam. In June 1963, President John Kennedy spoke to a cr owd of one million people in West Berlin, a city surrounded on all sides by the East German commu-nist state. His most famous statement was \"Ich bin ein Be rliner,\" which is German for \"I am a Berliner.\" Practice Read the excerpt from the speech and answer the fol-lowing question. eXceRPt Freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free. When all are free, then we can look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one and this country and this great continent of Europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe. When that day finally comes, as it will, the people of West Berlin can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they were in the front lines for almost two decades. All free men, wherever they may live, ar e citizens of Berlin, and, therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words \"Ich bin ein Berliner.\" 30.

Kennedy planned to move to Berlin after his pr esidency ended. c. Kennedy wanted to express his affection and admir ation to Berlin. d. Kennedy wanted Berliners to know they could t rust the United States. Decolonization One of the trends that marks the post-World War II era is the gradual process of decolonization in regions of the world once occupied by world powers. Eighty colonies have gained independence since the United Nations (UN) was established in 1945. The progress toward national independence is a project that will be complete only when these former colonies have developed sustainable and productive economies and systems of independent governance. 407407 n n n - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE Colonies and Empires Since antiquity, powerful empires and nations have co ntrolled and exploited weaker people and nations. When circumstances allowed, colonies would achieve their independence through peaceful or violent means. The American Revolution was the violent trans- formation of 13 colonies into one nation. In Latin America, Spain and Portugal's colonies became independent in the early nineteenth century. A number of mostly Christian areas in the Bal-kans in southeast Europe broke away from the declining Islamic Ottoman Empire in the nine-teenth century and declared independence. P rior to World War II, most of Africa, the Middle East, S outh Asia, and East Asia had been colonized by European nations and Japan. At the end of World War II, most of these countries were still under colo-nial control. Achieving Independence According the United Nations website, \"when the Unit ed Nations was founded in 1945, some 750 mil- lion people, nearly a third of the world's population, liv ed in territories that were dependent on colonial powers. Today, fewer than 2 million people live under colonial rule in the 16 remaining non-self-governing territories.\" The decolonization process gained momentum fol lowing the aftermath of World War II and the downgrading of the economic and political capacity of European countries. The devastation of the war weakened the capacity of European colonial powers to suppress the revolts rising within their colonies. As the process of decolonization continued to ad vance, in 1960, the United Nations General Assem- bly adopted its landmark Dec laration on the Grant- ing of Independence to Colonial Countries and Pe oples. The declaration afrmed the right of all people to self-determination and proclaimed that colo nialism should be brought to a speedy and unconditional end. Postwar America After World War II, the United States became the richest and most powerful nation on Earth, due to the nation's military capacity and innovative economy. Returning Soldiers Millions of returning soldiers, known as GIs, needed ed ucation and training to fully participate in the new and growing economy post-World War II. In response to that need, Congress passed the GI Bill. According to the Veterans Administration, \"the law's key provisions were education and training, loan guaranty for homes, farms or businesses, and unem-ployment pay. Before the war, college and homeown-ership were, for the most part, unreachable dreams fo r the average American. Thanks to the GI Bill, mil- lions who would have flooded the job market instead op ted for education.\" According to the GI Bill's History page on the De partment of Veterans Affairs website, \"In the peak year of 1947, veterans accounted for 49 percent of college admissions. By the time the original GI Bill ended on July 25, 1956, 7.8 million of 16 million World War II veterans had participated in an educa-tion or training program.\" Prosperity and Poverty The 1950s are often thought of as an idyllic time in whic h an unprecedented number of people joined the middle class and were leading relatively comfort-able lives. While there was some evidence supporting this v iew, millions of Americans were still being left behind, living in extreme poverty. President Lyndon Johnson believed that the fe deral government should take on this problem, and in 1964 he declared the War on Poverty. In a multi- 408408 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE n n pronged approach, a range of programs were estab- lished, including: n Head Start to give a boost to poor children in the preschool years n food stamps to help the poor pay for food Medicare health insurance for the elderly Medicaid health insurance for the poor n n n U nfortunately, poverty persists, as does the debate on the r ole and responsibility of the government to pro- vide a safety net for the country's neediest and most vulne rable people. American Foreign Policy since 9/11 On September 11, 2001, the terrorist organization Al-Qae da hijacked four airplanes and flew two of them into the World Trade Center in New York City and one into the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and crashed another in a eld near Shanksville, PA. The attacks resulted in the deaths of close to 3,000 people, nearly all of them civilians, and the devastation of a large area of lower Manhattan, the site of the World Trade Center. In the aftermath, the administration of Presi- dent George W. Bush launched a War on Terror , which involved: n open and covert military operations new security legislation efforts to block the nancing of terrorism increased domestic policing and intelligence gathering engaging other countries to support the War on Ter ror n n n n P roponents of the War on Terror point to the fact that, sinc e the attacks of September 11, no attack has occurred on U.S. soil. Criticism against this strategy is multifold, incl uding these arguments: The War on Terror is based on an ideology of fear and r epression that creates enemies and promotes violence rather than mitigating acts of terror and strengthening security. The worldwide campaign has too often become an e xcuse for governments to repress opposition groups and disregard international law and civil liberties. Governments should address terrorism through int ernational cooperation, using international law and respecting civil liberties and human rights. Critics also say that governments should address the ro ot causes of terrorism, notably political alienation due to prejudice, state-sponsored violence, and poverty. united States History Summary The foundational documents that shaped U.S. his-tory, such as the Declaration of Independence, the Co nstitution, and the Emancipation Proclamation, contain ideas that determined the country's progress as a society and its response to the rest of the world. The adoption of the Bill of Rights, the waging of the C ivil War, the Civil Rights movement, the struggle for women's suffrage, and the progressive era were all carried out in the quest for freedom and justice. During the twentieth century, the United States tur ned outward as its economic power increased and as the world became more interconnected. Today, the United States still leads the world in economic and military power and continues to uphold the founding ideals of the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all. economics It is important to understand how world economies work in general, and especially how the United States 409409 n n n - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE developed politically and economically. While some economic concepts are complex and highly technical, the basic building blocks of economic thought are fairly straightforward. Key Economic Events The foundation of a healthy economy is trust, and throughout its history, the United States developed institutions such as the Federal Reserve Board to help ensure trust by safeguarding nancial and eco-nomic stability. Reliable Currency A crucial component of a stable economy is a reliable curr ency. This belief was promoted by Alexander Hamilton, the rst secretary of the Treasury, who suc-cessfully argued that the new government of the Unit ed States should pay back all the debts that the Continental Congress had incurred during the Amer - ican Revolutionary War. Few believed that the United States would hono r its debts, so the debt issued by the Continental Congress and the states was considered worthless. When the debt was repaid, speculators became rich and the nancial reliability of the United States was established. Foundations of the Banking System Hamilton also argued for a Bank of the United States, whic h would be able to make loans and have its bills received for payment by the federal government. He believed that such a bank would be helpful for the development of manufacturing in the United States. The Bank of the United States was established and lasted for 40 years. In the country's early history, opposition to cen - tral government's involvement in banking was strong. In 1 836, President Andrew Jackson let the Charter of the Second Bank of the United States expire, leaving the nation without a central bank until the Federal Reserve System was created in 1913. Through 1836, state legisla - tures had the right to charter banks, and they did so. Despite the Constitution stating that only the fe deral government had the right to coin money, the Supreme Court ruled in 1837 in Briscoe v. Bank of Kentucky that state banks and the notes they issued were also constitutional. Over 700 individual banks had the right to issue paper money. Starting in 1837, the United States passed laws and implemented a free banking system, which did not include any form of government restriction on banking activities, except for the enforcement of legal contracts and prohibi-tions against fraud. In practice, the system was unstable. As eco- nomic growth began to expand during economic upt urns, banks would issue more banknotes, but inflation would result as credit was extended too widely. These business cycles would repeat them-selves, leaving the country's economic health subject to w ild fluctuations. The free banking era came to a close with the passage of the National Banking Acts of 1863 and 1864. The laws created a system of national banks and a uniform national currency and helped nance the Civil War. The banking system still had a problem. A rigid mone y supply and limited liquidity caused nancial panics in 1873, 1884, 1893, and 1907. Each of these panics was followed by a depression and then by renewed prosperity. However, the 1907 panic was so severe that the richest man in the world, J.P . Morgan, loaned money to key banks to keep the entire nan-cial system from collapsing. The Federal Reserve System In reaction to the crisis of 1907, the Federal Reserve Ac t of 1913 created the earliest version of the current Federal Reserve System. Today, the Federal Reserve System consists of 12 regional banks a board of governors a board chairman 410410 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE n n n n n n The system is responsible for maintaining the nan-cial security and well-being of the United States. In all ac tions that it takes, the goals of the Fed are to encourage employment and control inflation (a gen-eral increase in prices). The Federal Reserve System ac complishes what Hamilton had hoped the Bank of the United States would do. Modern Fiscal Policy Fiscal policy\u2014how government raises revenue and budg ets its expenditures\u2014became more important in shaping the economy in the rst half of the twenti-eth century, especially as the Great Depression devas-tated livelihoods and destroyed wealth. Milestones in the development of scal policy incl ude: The 16th amendment to the Constitution was r atied in 1913, the same year as the Federal Reserve System, making it possible for Congress to authorize a graduated income tax. The Federal Reserve System and enhanced gov- ernment scal powers were not strong enough to enab le the country to avoid the stock market crash of 1929, which was preceded by extensive uncon-trolled speculation in real estate and stock markets in the earlie r part of the decade. Following the crash of 1929, the economy head ed into a long downward spiral known as the Great Depression. Businesses closed, people with-drew their savings in runs on banks, and millions lost their jobs. Many scholars suggest that the economy didn't fully recover from the Depression until scal spending on defense increased substantially during World War II. The election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932 was the beginning of a new era of governmental involvement in the national economy and the per - sonal welfare of millions of Americans. Roosevelt pr oposed and the Congress approved an unprece- dented series of federal programs called the Ne w Deal to help the country recover from the Depression. The New Deal included the creation of the following: Tennessee Valley Authority, which built dams and electric power lines National Industrial Recovery Act, which enabled the president to regulate industry Glass-Steagall Banking Bill, which instituted safe banking policies Works Progress Administration (WPA), which provided jobs for the unemployed National Labor Relations Act, which created the National Labor Relations Board Social Security Act, which guaranteed pensions to millions, as well as assistance to dependent children and the disabled Types of Energy Wind and water power allo wed parts of northern Europe to become the rst countries in world history not dependent on animals and people for the bulk of their energy needs. After 1600, thousands of wind-mills were built, with the greatest concentration in Hol land. About 500,000 water mills and 200,000 windmills in Europe helped create economies totally based on renewable energy. At the beginning of the industrial age, ste am engines powered mainly by coal, the rst widely used fossil fuel, became the most important source of power. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, electric motors and internal combustion engines powered by oil and gas fossil fuels became key com-ponents of the energy needs of the United States and other ind ustrialized economies. Since the rst co mmercial oil well was drilled in 1859, and through most of the twentieth century, the United States was the world's leading oil producer. But by the 1970s, the United States and other indus-trialized nations were importing a substantial amount of oil from the Middle East. 1970s Energy Crisis Fossil fuels, including oil, coal, and gas, have powered muc h of the economic development of the modern era. In the 1970s, the price of oil, one of the main 411411 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE energy sources, skyrocketed and had serious effects on the economic health of the country and subse-quent debates about energy policy in the United States and around the world. Energy is an important part of any nation's economy. The Energy Crisis in the 1970s was an interna- tional event. It arose from the manipulation of oil pr ices by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), an organization of Middle East-ern countries that control most of the world's oil pro-duction. In 1973 and 1974, led by Saudi Arabia, OPEC restricted the supply of oil in response to the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Arab nations, resulting in oil prices more than tripling. In 1979, there was a second energy crisis set off by the Iranian Revolution, which resulted in decreases in the amount of oil being produced. Since the United States had price controls on oil, supplies of oil dropped, resulting in shortages. Since the 1970s, the United States and many other countries have been encouraging the develop- ment of alternative forms of energy to offset reliance on f ossil fuels.

Relationship between Political and Economic Freedoms Many have argued that an intimate link exists between political and economic freedoms. Ideas about that relationship have been instrumental throughout American economic and political history. Milton Friedman and Economic Freedom In his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom, economist Milton Friedman argued that economic freedom and political freedom are linked, claiming: n It is no accident that modern capitalism and democracy arose at the same time in the same nations. n Civil liberties, political freedom, and the existence of free markets are all necessary as a whole for each to exist. F riedman took a strict view of free markets, for example, claiming that Social Security is an attack on economic freedom. Alternative Views As nations evolve and adapt, the relationship between polit ical and economic freedom has been, and will be, tested. In Russia, following the breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1991, an experiment in increasing personal freedom did not lead to economic freedom, and the country has even seen an erosion of individ-ual rights, as a corrupt and coercive economic system de veloped. In China, the growth of the economy has been proceeding in concert with an improvement in economic freedom. But even though China seems to be on track to become the world's largest economy, it is unclear whether political freedoms are on the rise. It is an open question whether in coming years eco- nomic prosperity will lead to political freedom or the lac k of political freedom will undermine the thriving economy. Many economists and development experts hav e linked the level of inequality in a society with negative economic, as well as social, results. For instance, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson argue in Why Nations Fail (Crown, 2012) that a country's economic health and success rise the more individu-als across the spectrum share in a country's wealth. If the w ealthy elite of a nation successfully control a dis- proportionate amount of its resources and produc-tion, they conclude, that nation is in danger of falling in to a downward spiral of authoritarianism and corruption. Fundamental Economic Concepts A knowledge of key concepts in economics is critical to understanding how societies operate. The opera-tion of capitalism\u2014the economic system in place in the United States and throughout much of the world\u2014 revolves around several basic ideas. Markets and Competition A market is a place where buyers and sellers engage in transactions involving the exchange of goods and services for money. A market can be a physical place, a virtual place, or a combination of the two. For example, the New York Stock Exchange is a physical place that is located on Wall Street in New York City. However, many investors participate in this market electronically from their computers, never actually visiting the stock exchange. A free market is a market that, theoretically, has little or no government intervention, such as taxes, subsidies, or regulation. In reality, in free-market economies such as in the United States, the govern-ment intervenes in the market to a lesser or greater ext ent to ensure its smooth operation. 413413 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE Competition is the situation in which two or more sellers create the same types of goods and ser- vices to sell. Free markets depend on competition. started his company Microsoft with little more than his understanding of computer programming and capacity to develop a computer operating system. He built it into one of the most successful and influential companies in the world. A monopoly e xists when a single company or group dominates all or nearly all of the market for a given type of product or service. While entrepreneurs start companies and come up with innovations, investors provide a company with money that can be spent to grow and run the business. The money that an investor gives to help nance a company in return for partial ownership is called an investment. Sometimes an entrepreneur provides investment to start his or her own company. Investments can consist of time as well as money. C ompetition and monopoly are often seen as o pposites. While for the most part the U.S. nancial system encourages competition, there are a few instances where monopolies are allowed and even encouraged. For example, public utilities, such as supplying of water to homes, stores, and factories, are often set up as monopolies. Economic Production Practice Economic production is the capacity to produce goods. Inputs of economic production include labor and capital. The following is an excerpt from a campaign speech by Elizabeth Warren when she ran for the U.S. Senate seat from Massachusetts. n Labor is the work of people that provides goods and services. eXceRPt n Capital is money and assets for the production of goods and services. Examples of assets include tools, such as an electric drill; infrastructure, such as a road or the Internet; and buildings, such as a factory. A capitalist e conomy is a system based on the exis- tence of the private ownership of capital. When people engage in a business, they usually exp ect to make a prot. Prot is the return a business receives after all operating expenses have been met. Prot is usually measured in terms of money. A key element of a capitalist economy is its abil- ity to develop new businesses that produce new prod-ucts and services. Entr epreneurship is the capacity and willingness to develop, organize, and manage a business venture while taking on the possible risks. An entrepreneur takes on risk f or the potential to make prot. Entrepreneurship combined with land, labor, natural resources, capital, expertise, and ideas can produce prot. For example, Bill Gates There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own. Nobody. You built a factory out there? Good for you. But I want to be clear: you moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for; you hired work - ers the rest of us paid to educate; you were sa fe in your factory because of police forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for. You didn't have to worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory, and hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of us did. Now look, you built a factory and it tu rned into something terrific, or a great idea? God bless. Keep a big hunk of it. But part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along. 414414 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE n 33. Based on the views expressed in this excerpt, Elizabe th Warren would most likely support which of the following policies? a. a tax cut for small businesses so that they hav e a better chance to succeed and hire more workers b. higher taxes on corporate prots so that suc cessful companies help support infrastructure c. cutting the federal decit so that future ge nerations are not saddled by the debts we incurred d. privatization of much of our infrastructure, incl uding major roads, water supply, police, and reghters Division of Labor People and companies have discovered that it is often mor e protable and efcient to focus on what each does best to increase production. Specialization is the situation in which each person or company in the production effort creates what each is best at creating. For example, expert welders would probably buy their safety shoes rather than make them themselves. They specialize in weld-ing and use earnings from plying their specialty to pay f or their other needs. Productivity is a measure of output in relation to the inputs of raw materials, labor, and capital. Usu-ally, companies that are more productive, producing qualit y products for less cost than their competition, will survive best in a free market. American society has a high degree of div ision of labor , where people depend on each other to pro- duce most of the goods and services required to sus-tain life. Economic interdependence exists even in re mote areas. People depend on each other for pro- tection, keeping roads open, and for information, suc h as weather reports. Microeconomics and Macroeconomics The study of how economies work is commonly divided into microeconomics and macroeconomics. Both deal with important concepts, such as supply and demand and the price and cost of production. But each branch of study comes at these concepts from a different perspective. Small Details and the Larger Picture Microeconomics deals with how factors such as price feed into the decisions of buyers and sellers in a mar - ketplace. It looks at the smaller picture and focuses on: n basic theories of supply and demand how businesses decide how much of something to produce how businesses decide what to charge for a commodity n M acroeconomics co nsiders the national economy as a whole, looking at the factors that influence aggre-gate supply and demand. Since macroeconomics is associat ed with national economies, it deals with, among other variables: n unemployment rates gross domestic product (GDP) overall price levels, including inflation n n T o understand the difference between microeconom- ics and macroeconomics, consider the price of a smart phone. Microeconomics looks at the demand for a smartphone at different price points and with different amounts of supply. Macroeconomics looks at the current state of prices in general as measured by the consumer price index, which is based on data collected nationwide. Supply and Demand The laws of supply and demand are key components in ec onomic activity. 415415 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE Supply is the amount of a good or service avail- able at a given place and time. Demand is how much people desire to acquire a good or service at that same place and time. Price is the amount charged for a good or service at a given place and time. In a free market, prices vary for a good or ser - vice until there is a balance between supply and de mand. Practice The following graph shows the relationship between sup ply and demand. Equilibrium is the point where the two lines cross and represents a balance of supply and demand. Supply Demand Price Quantity 34. After the introduction of the new model, the price and quantity of the current model truck would likely _____________. 35. When a new model truck is introduced, de mand for the current model would likely _______________. National and International Institutions On the national level, the key institution is the Fed- e ral Reserve System. It is the central bank of the Unit ed States supporting its mandates for maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term inte rest rates. At the international level, two major institu- tions are the Int ernational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. In addition to promoting eco- nomic growth, these institutions also act to protect and stabiliz e the world economy. n The IMF's main objectives are to help facilitate international nancial stability in the global banking system and monetary cooperation. It also works to promote trade and economic growth around the globe. n The World Bank provides loans to developing countries for the purpose of promoting foreign investment and international trade and for facili-tating capital investment. Key Components in Economic Policy F iscal policy is the use of governmental taxation and spending to influence the economy. Monetary policy is the control of the supply of money and interest rates by the monetary authority of a country. Inflation is a rise in the general level of prices of g oods and services in an economy over a period of time, whereas deflation is a drop in the general level of prices of goods and services. While excessive infla-tion is commonly seen as a threat to the economy by er oding the purchasing power of individuals, defla- tion can be a problem as well. If prices are generally pe rceived as falling, an incentive exists to delay pur - chases until a later time when they will cost less, de pressing economic activity. The gross domestic product (GDP) is the mon- etary value of all nished goods and services pro-duced within a country's borders in a specic time pe riod, usually a year. The size of a nation's GDP as well as changes to the GDP from year to year are strong macroeconomic indicators of an economy's overall health. Unemployment oc curs when people are look- ing for work and cannot nd a job. The best known 416416 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE n n n n n measure of unemployment is the unemployment rate, which is a macroeconomic measure of economic health. A tariff is a tax imposed on imported goods and services. In addition to raising revenue, tariffs on imported products give an advantage to domestically produced competitors. Keynesian versus Supply-Side Economics Two opposing views of monetary and scal policy are Ke ynesian and supply-side economics. Keynesian ec onomic theory is named after its founder, John Maynard Keynes. His model contends that: Monetary policy and scal policy should be man-ag ed by the public sector, or government. Centralized policies are needed to smooth out the r ecurring boom-or-bust periods of the business cycle. First proposed during the Great Depression, it was the d ominant economic theory until the stagflation period of the 1970s, in which the U.S. economy suf-fered from high inflation coupled with poor job and ec onomic growth. Supply-side economics was p roposed in the 1970s as a conservative alternative to Keynesian eco-nomics. It claims that: Prosperity is promoted through increased pro- d uction or supply. Supply generates demand for products and other related products. Focus on economic producers leads to a more robust economy and greater capacity to generate jobs. The theory promoted limiting or eliminating rest raints on production by lowering income and capital gains tax rates and restricting regulation. In the Great Recession that began in 2008, Keynesians advocated for government stimulus spending to jump-start the economy, even if it resulted in high federal budget decits. Supply-siders advocated for tax cuts and severe cuts in government spending. In general, Keynesian proposals have come from Democrats while supply-side proposals have come from Republicans. A combination of the two was implemented to alleviate the recession. Practice 36. A __________ economist would be more likely to s upport a very high sugar tariff. a. supply-side b. Keynesian Consumer Economics All of us are consumers. Nearly all activities we engage in have an economic component. Going out to dinner, buying a home, and attending college are all decisions that have economic aspects and outcomes. Savings and Banks For an individual or family, savings is the difference be tween the amount of money spent in a time period and the amount of money earned. Savings can either be set aside for future use or be invested. Most people save their money in a bank, a nancial institution that accepts deposits and makes loans. Its customers include individuals, nonprot organizations, and businesses. Banks offer their cus-tomers savings and checking accounts, certicates of de posit, credit cards, automobile and student loans, mortgages, and lines of credit. Sometimes we obtain a good or service and ent er into an agreement to pay for it later, usually with interest. That agreement is a request for credit. Consumers use various types of credit. We use a credit card to obtain many goods and services; we then receive a statement at the end of the month and pay interest on balances left unpaid at the due date. 417417 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE The largest credit commitment that most people enter into is a mortgage for a home. The home buyer pays a down payment to the seller while the bank or other lender pays the balance. The home buyer agrees to pay the bank back, with interest, in payments that can last as long as 30 years. Student loans now comprise the second largest form of consumer debt after home mortgages. The national government helps students nance their education because it is considered an investment in the productive capacity of the nation. However, the rising debt burden faced by students is considered by some to threaten the economic health of future work-ers and the country. When consumers buy goods or services on cre dit, they may be victimized by theft or fraud. Con- sumer credit laws protect buyers and limit their lia-bility in situations such as identity theft, especially if the fr aud or abuse is reported quickly. Other con- sumer credit laws are written to protect companies. economics Summary Economic and political freedoms are closely linked in capitalist systems, which are based on free markets and the ability of consumers and producers to engage in economic activity of their own choosing without much government regulation. In practice, however, governments regulate economic activity to ensure safe nancial practices and healthy levels of competition. Markets and competition, supply and demand, and di vision of labor are among the cornerstones of the U.S. capitalist system. Just about everyone partici-pates in this system, both as suppliers of capital, labor, or investment and as consumers and producers of goods and services. Given the high level of freedom allowed, entre- preneurship is a hallmark of the U.S. economy. This spirit of economic freedom fuels the growth of new products and services, and government involvement, limited as it is, aims to protect the consumer and business from excesses and abuses of this very free- dom. geography and the w orld Understanding the world around you (its history, environmental processes, and cultures) is critical to living as an informed citizen. Development of Classical Civilizations Until about 12,000 years ago, the most advanced humans were hunter-gatherers, taking what they needed to live from the surrounding environment. Starting at about 10,000 B.C. in the Middle East, agri- culture began, initiating a process of development that has continued ever since. Innovations in the Neolithic period included the rst villages and towns, domestication of plants and animals, and the devel-opment of pottery. The oldest structure found from this p eriod is a wall and tower in Jericho that are at least 11,000 years old. Early Civilizations As agriculture advanced and food surpluses could be ac cumulated, larger population centers could be sup- ported. By 3500 B.C., this led to the development of the early civilizations we are familiar with today. First among these early civilizations were the Sume rians, who settled in the valley between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is today called Iraq and is also known as Mesopotamia. This civiliza-tion developed characteristics common to those that fol lowed it, including a large population center, art and monumental architecture, a system of govern-ment, division of labor and social classes, and written language. W ith the invention of written language, human- ity moved from prehistory to history. In the eastern 418418 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE hemisphere, ancient civilizations developed in a number of river valleys, including: n the Nile in Egypt, where civilization remained stable for centuries the Huang Ho or Yellow River in China, wherein another civilization also lasted for centuries the Indus in India, where the civilization vanished around 1500 B.C.E. until archeologists rediscov- ered it n n I n the western hemisphere, civilization developed inde pendently a few thousand years later. None of these ancient civilizations developed an alphabet for written language like we use today. The rst written language was Pho enician, developed in what is today called Lebanon. The old-est surviving alphabetic written language still in use to day is Hebrew, developed in what is now called Israel, which is south of Lebanon. For the most part, pictographic written languages, such as Egyptian hieroglyphics, which could contain thousands of dif-ferent symbols, have disappeared. Chinese and Japa-nese are the only two surviving pictographic written languages. Rising Populations, Technology, and Warfare A t the beginning of the Neolithic period, roughly fro m 10,000 B.C.E. to 2000 B.C.E., there might have been as few as ve million people on Earth. By the time of the Roman Empire (which began in 27 B.C.E.), that number had probably increased to about 200 million people. While warfare became one destructive way to deal with rising populations in limited territory, a more constructive approach was the development of tools that allowed the creation of more wealth and increased the capacity of the planet to support more people. The development of metals such as bronze and iron resulted in more durable and effective farm-ing tools that could increase crop yields. However, these ne w technologies were also used to make more lethal weapons to kill more adversaries. While today we know about the rise and fall of many ancient civilizations, we are still not sure why warfare developed as a way of settling disputes. A number of factors were most likely involved, includ-ing the pressure of expanding populations, greed and ambit ion of the most powerful, and temptation of great wealth generated in the large cities. Greece and Rome The last of the major Mesopotamian empires was the Pe rsian Empire, centered in what is now Iran. The failure of the Persians to defeat the Greek city-states, followed by the Greek conquest of the Persian Empire in 334 B.C.E., led to a major cultural change through- out the Middle East. But the most important legacies of the Greeks were cultural, not military. n The earliest form of limited democracy was developed in the Greek city-state of Athens. Theater and philosophy flourished in Athens. Art and science were taken to a higher level of development. n n T he Greek states were eventually defeated by the Ro man Empire, which had overthrown the Roman Republic (established around 500 B.C.E.). During the republican period, Rome introduced a new form of government, including an important role for the Roman Senate, which performed a pivotal advisory role in the republic's governance. Unfortunately, by the time it collapsed, the Ro man Empire had high levels of corruption and dysfunction. At the same time, it developed great public works such as aqueducts and roads and con-structed the most complete and just law code of the ancient w orld. 419419 n n n n n n - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE The Environment and Societal Development For much of human history, societal development did not appear to have major consequences on the environment. The earth is so huge and its resources so vast, human impact seemed negligible. However, even in prehistory, humans have had signicant impact on the environment. For example, humans probably played a role in the extinction of large Ice Age mammals, such as the mammoth, the mastodon, and the saber-toothed cat. Environmental Issues and Sustainability Ongoing societal impacts have placed increasing pr essure on the environment. These impacts include population growth, economic activities, and con-sumption patterns. Humanity has reached a point whe re environmental degradation threatens sustain- able development as well as human health and we ll-being. wHat iS SuS taina BilitY? According to the Merriam-Webster diction - ary, sustainable means: of, relating to, or being a method of har- vesting or using a resource so that the resource is not depleted or permanently damaged While the developed worlds of Europe and North America have contributed the most to environmental degradation, rapidly industrializing countries such as China, India, and Brazil are starting to take a larger role. Issues include the following: Climate change, resulting from emissions of car - b on into the atmosphere from industrial pro- cesses, is a major worldwide concern. Air pollution due to industrial processes and au to emissions is a threat to health and the envi- ronment. In China, for instance, air quality in major cit ies is one of the biggest concerns. Deforestation due to commercial development is a thr eat to biodiversity and is one of the major factors in climate change. Practice 37. Which of the following actions would most sup port sustainable development? a. Encourage workers to telecommute when possib le and work from home. b. Use recently developed fracking technology to g et oil from shale. c. Pump more water from underground aquif ers in arid areas of the world. d. Encourage industrial development in de veloping economies. Population Growth and Urban Development Human population has been exploding since the be ginning of the Industrial Age, when it was less than one billion. Population has increased massively since then, but growth has begun to slow. Population is now more than seven billion. Population growth peaked at 2.2% in 1963, and by 2012 had declined below 1.1%. Some nations, such as Japan and Russia, are already experiencing an aging of the total popula-tion as birth rates remain below replacement rat es. Early civilizations were marked by the development of urban centers. However, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, urban settlement has dra-matically increased, rst in the developed world and now in r egions of the developing world as well. To support growing cities and populations, rur al areas have had to adapt. While a much smaller 420420 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE percentage of the population lives in rural areas, these areas must still produce sufcient food for a growing population while maintaining an environ-ment that protects biodiversity and mitigates the impact of climate change.

Recognizing these variations in human society allows for increased understanding between peoples around the globe. T he ways physical and cultural life is orga- nized form some of the key concepts in geographic study. In geography, it is important to understand the dif- ference between a place and a region. A place is a location that has some meaning to an individual or group of individuals. That meaning can have a physical and/or a human dimension. A region is an area that is distinct for either physical or social reasons. Regions are bounded by homogeneous characteristics. 421421 n n n n n n n n n n n n - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE Regions can be climate based, such as the Sahara desert region. Regions can be politically based, such as the C ommunist bloc region in the middle of the twentieth century. The boundaries of a region are determined by the e xtent of the area of homogeneity sharing the dis- tinct characteristic(s). Types of regions include: continental geographical historical paleogeographic (or historical geographic) natural resource religious political administrative regions controlled by military force A nation is a group of people who are bound together through history, culture, language, religion, customs, and values. A state is a portion of land with a sovereign government and laws. (State can be applied to the subnational areas in the United States and other countries, but the term also applies to completely separate countries as well.) The difference between nation and state can be considered the difference between ethnicity and citizenship, though the terms are often used interchangeably. Culture Culture, the set of beliefs and social practices shared by a group of people, is one factor that helps to dene regions, nations, and states. According to the Decla- ration on Cultural Diversity issue d by the United Nations Educational, Scientic, and Cultural Orga-nization (UNESCO), Culture should be regarded as the set of distinc-tive spiritual, material, intellectual and emo-tional features of society or a social group, and . . . it encompasses, in addition to art and litera- ture, lifestyles, ways of living together, value syst ems, traditions and beliefs. Article 1 goes on to say: eXceRPt Culture takes diverse forms across time and space. This diversity is embodied in the uniqueness and plurality of the identities of the groups and societies making up human - kind. As a source of exchange, innovation and cr eativity, cultural diversity is as neces- sary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature. In this sense, it is the common heri- tage of humanity and should be recognized an d affirmed for the benefit of present and future generations. Cultural diffusion or exchange occurs between groups of people as they spread their products or ideas to one another. This phenomenon has increased greatly in the past few decades as globalizing forces, including the Internet, have taken hold in all regions of the world. Assimilation oc curs when a minority group, or individuals, adopts the customs and ideas of the dominant culture. Assimilation is an issue of consid-erable debate as populations have become more mob ile and immigration across national borders has escalated during the current era of globalization. Human Migration Human migration has been a constant throughout history. People migrate for a wide range of reasons, including the need for food and livelihood, greater 422422 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE n n economic opportunity, and freedom from oppres- sion. Few regions of the world today are not the prod-ucts of wide-ranging human migration and cultural ex changes that result from migration. Out of Africa and Early Migrations From their origins in Africa, humans have spread to ev ery continent on Earth. Human migration has continued throughout histo rical times. One example was the migration of the Germanic peoples into Europe, which helped bring an end to the Roman Empire. Another was the migration of Turks from Central Asia to what is now Turkey. The following map illustrates human migration rou tes out of Africa and Asia. AFRICA ASIA AUSTRALIA EUROPE Practice 39. Based on the map, humans rst entered West- ern Europe from what direction? a. north b. south c. east d. west Migration in the Modern Era Human migration continues today and is aided by mod ern technology. Immigrants from all over the world have been moving to the Americas, especially to the United States. People from Africa and the Middle East have been immigrating to Europe. The be nets and costs of immigration are a topic of debate around the world. Migrations can also occur within a country. In nineteenth-century America, many pioneers mig rated from the east to the west. In the twentieth century, Southern rural African A mericans moved to Northern cities, while many whites of varying ethnicities moved from urban areas to the suburbs. 423423 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE Migration is an ongoing feature of human history. It began when our ancient ancestors migrated from Africa and peopled the continents. It continues today as the increasing interconnectedness across the world allows people to seek new opportunities and better lives in other countries.

In 1770, outside the State House in Boston, MA, B ritish soldiers shot and killed ve colo- nists in an event still known as the Boston Massa cre. When the soldiers were brought to trial, their lawyer was the colonist patriot John Adams. Which of the following foundational principles was most likely the key reason Adams took on this case? a. defending the underdog b. individual rights c. right to bear arms d. rule of law 424424 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE 5. In 1734, the governor of New York, William C osby, had the printer Peter Zenger arrested and tried for libel for accusing Cosby of cor - ruption in the newspaper the New York Weekly J ournal. The governor ordered copies of the newspaper burned. At the trial, the judge, who owed his job to the governor, instructed the jury that they must determine only whether the criticism was printed and that it did not matter whether it was true. The jury disagreed and found Zenger not guilty. This case was a landmark in the development of a. governmental corruption. b. freedom of the press. c. book burning. d. separation of powers. 6. In the early 1960s, an independence movement sw ept across Africa. In just a few years, colonies of European nations, such as France, the United Kingdom, and Belgium, became inde-pendent nations with constitutions and free e lections. This movement was a clear expres- sion of the philosophy of a. natural rights. b. divine rights. 7.

On September 22, 1862, what was President Linc oln's motivation when he declared the following? eXceRPt That on the first day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States, shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free; and the Executive Government of the United States, including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and main - tain the freedom of such persons, and will d o no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom. a. moral outrage at the dehumanization of sla very b. to increase the chances of the Union w inning the Civil War c. to conrm his legacy as one of the greatest p residents d. the need to recruit former slaves into armed f orces 10. What is the main idea of this passage? eXceRPt At the heart of the U.S. Civil Rights move - ment in the 1950s and 1960s was the use of n onviolent direct-action protest, including student sit-ins at lunch counters. Inspired by the example of Jesus, and the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi during India's struggle for independence, black church and commu- nity leaders in the United States began a dvocating the use of non-violence in their own struggle. Beyond spontaneous and planned student sit-ins, several organiza- tions were formed to fight for civil rights u sing Gandhi's model of nonviolent dissent and action. Three of the most influential groups\u2014the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and the Student Nonvi- olent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)\u2014 w ere pivotal in bringing about social change in America. Source: www.pbs.org/independentlens/ februaryone/civilrights.html. a. The use of nonviolent direct-action protest was at the hear t of the Civil Rights movement. b. Nonviolent protest, as developed by M ahatma Gandhi, is a powerful instrument for gaining rights. c. Black church and community leaders s upported the use of nonviolence in the struggle for civil rights. d. CORE, SCLC, and SNCC were civil rights o rganizations that provided leadership for the movement. 426426 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE 11. The cartoonist who drew this image is most lik ely hoping to elicit which of the following reactions? Source: College Debt #106133, by Bob Englehart, The Hartford Courant, February 10, 2012. a. If you can't manage your money, you need to suffer the consequences. b. People who can't afford to go to college should not ha ve incurred the debt in the rst place. c. Families need to spend on more practical thing s than a college education. d. We need to help our college graduates who ar e drowning in debt. 12. One of the powers that is shared by the federal and stat e governments is the power to raise revenue. What was the most likely reason that led to this power being shared? a. The federal and state governments both ne ed money to operate effectively. b. The federal government would be too weak w ithout the power to raise revenue. c. The federal government would be too strong w ith the power to raise revenue. d. It helps maintain the balance of power b etween the two levels of government. 13. The amendment process to the U.S. Constitu- tion requires that three-quarters of the states ap prove a proposed amendment for it to go into effect. Which of the following conclusions regarding the number of states needed to ratify an amendment is correct? a. All the original 13 states were needed to r atify the rst ten amendments since they were proposed with the Constitution and were part of a grand bargain between Federalists and Anti-Federalists. b. Twenty-seven states were needed to ratify the 13th ame ndment, which abolished slavery, since there were 36 states at the end of the Civil War. c. The reason that 36 states were needed to r epeal the 18th amendment in 1933 was that 36 states were needed to ratify the 18th amendment creating Prohibition in 1919. d. Because the United States now has 50 states, 37 stat es will have to be on record ratifying the 16th Amendment\u2014which was passed in 1909 and authorized the income tax\u2014even though only 36 states were needed then. 427427 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE answers and e xplanations Chapter Practice 1. b. A plutocrat is an individual whose power is based on wealth. Although a duke (choice a) is part of the privileged class in an aristocracy, the term plutocrat refers to wealthy individuals without aristocratic titles. An elected ofcial (choice c) is selected by a democratic process, ideally unrelated to wealth or social status. A military general (choice d) does not usually rule government except in the case of a military junta or in a stratocracy, although military lead- ers can also run for elected ofce. 2. b. T he American Revolution was a rebellion against the privilege of English aristocracy and the aristocratic system. Although it was won by militia, the battle was against the British king and his aristocracy, not one junta against another. 3. a. I n a democratic society, power rests in the free thought and expression of individuals. Authoritarian forms of government suppress personal freedoms and expression. 4. d. A meritocracy is based on merit, intelligence, and talent, and civil testing leads to social promotion. 5. disadvantage 6. disadvantage 7. disadvantage 8. advantage 9. advantage 10. advantage 11. advantage 12. The executive branch checks the judicial b ranch. 13. The executive branch checks the legislative b ranch. 14. The legislative branch checks the executive b ranch. 15. The judicial branch checks the legislative b ranch. 16. The legislative branch checks the judicial b ranch. 17. The judicial branch checks the executive b ranch. 18. state. State governments have the power to g rant corporate status to businesses. 19. fed eral. The federal government regulates inter - state commerce, including banks that have hea dquarters and branches in different states. 20. fed eral. The federal government runs the U.S. Postal Service and therefore pays local post ofce employees, even in rural areas. 21. the king. In the Magna Carta, we r efers to the king, also known as the royal we. The Magna Carta cites barons and freemen, and common people are not referred to at all. 22. A nswers will vary: The colonists agreed to form a government that would make laws. They also agreed to obey the laws and listen to ofcials appointed by the government. 23. b. T he Declaration of Independence laid out the justication for a revolution against the rule of Great Britain. In declaring independence, the authors and signers of the declaration were revolting against the current government. 428428 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE 24. a. T he reason for the reversal between the 1896 and 1954 cases is that nearly 60 years of experi-ence showed that \"separate but equal\" was a fal-lacy. By 1954, the evidence was overwhelming that se gregation was very damaging for black people. Although the court membership had more liberals in 1954 than in 1896 (choice b), the decision was unanimous, so that could not have been the most important reason. While the 1954 case was about education (choice c), it was also influential in ending segregation in trans- portation and public accommodations. The e qual protection clause (choice d) had been in effect since 1868. 25. c. Emma Lazar us would be most favorable toward the Dream Act if she were alive today. She expresses support in her poem for immi-gration of the least fortunate and the idea of the U nited States as a country that welcomes needy individuals hoping for a better life. Completion of a fence and barrier with motion detectors along the Mexican border (choice a) is opposite to the greeting of poor immigrants that Lazarus supports in her poem. She would be less con- cerned with immigrants complying with b ureaucratic details in order to gain entry to the United States (choices b and d). 26. 1847. 27. 1847. 28. d. U nion membership was close to its all-time peak of approximately 23 million when the UAW rejoined the AFL-CIO in 1981. 29. c. A t the time of the founding of the CIO, the slope of the membership line was steeper than it was at the other times. 30. d. P resident Kennedy used metaphorical lan-guage to let Berliners know they could trust the U nited States. By identifying with Berliners, he was saying that he and the United States would protect West Berlin. Kennedy and Berliners did have a special rapport, but it was the unspoken security guarantee that was most important. 31. 1980. A djusted for inflation, the cost of oil was the highest in the year 1980, when it was $71.48 a barrel in year 2004 dollars. 32. 1969. A djusted for inflation, the cost of oil was the lowest in the year 1969, when it was $7.45 a barrel in year 2004 dollars. 33. b. Elizab eth Warren would most likely support higher taxes on corporate prots so that suc- cessful companies help support infrastructure. She mak es it clear that the existing infrastruc- ture helped these companies succeed. 34. After the introduction of the new model, the p rice and quantity of the current model truck would likely decrease. When demand drops, the price drops. With fewer sales, the quantity of unsold cars would likely increase until a new equilibrium is established. 35. When a new model truck is introduced, d emand for the current model would likely decrease. 36. a. T ariffs give an advantage to domestic supply, so they would more likely be supported by a supply-side economist. 429429 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE 37. a. Enc ouraging workers to telecommute\u2014 working from home\u2014would most support sus-tainable development, since energy from fossil fue ls is saved when workers do not have to commute. Using recently developed fracking technology to get oil from oil shale (choice b) would result in more CO 2 in the atmosphere, worsening global warming, and it is not sus- tainable. Pumping more water from under - ground aquifers in arid areas of the world (c hoice c) is not sustainable because, without other measures, the underground water will be depleted. Industrial development (choice d) uses a great deal of resources and may not be sustainable. 38. c. W ith a steadily declining population involv-ing fewer new births, Russia's population will be old er; that will most likely be the most pressing of the listed issues. Russia will have fewer peo-ple than it has today, which means it will need less f ood (choice a). Since housing (choice b) requires maintenance, it will need some atten-tion, but not as much as dealing with the needs o f the aging population. 39. c. A ccording to the map, humans rst entered Western Europe from the east. There are no immigration routes from any other direction entering Western Europe. Social Studies Knowledge Review 1. d. T own meeting, in which every registered voter can participate, is considered to be direct democracy. 2. c. No taxation without representation most dir ectly expresses the notion of popular sovereignty. The colonists claimed that the right to collect taxes depended on the consent of the people. Don't tread on me (choice a) was a deant warning to the British but did not address the notion of popular sovereignty. A man's house is his castle (choice b) was said by James Otis, who was objecting to British sol- diers living in private homes in Boston. J oin or die (choice d) was a demand that the colonies and the colonists all join the Revolution cou-pled with a threat of what would happen if they did not. 3. a. W hile having an elected Parliament and president is considered to be evidence of democracy (choice d), in Iran all democratically elected individuals can be overruled by a reli- gious authority. A government in which the nal sa y is given to a religious leader is a theoc- racy. An oligarchy (choice b) is rule by a small g roup of people, and even though the Assembly of Experts is a small group and does vote the supreme leader into power\u2014and technically can vote the supreme leader out of power, although since it was created in 1979, it has not done so\u2014the supreme leader has ultimate power. He gets his legitimacy from his religious stature, not his military power, which is often how a dictator (choice c) attains power. 4. d. T he rule of law would dictate that every accused person is entitled to a competent defense and a fair trial. 430430 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE 5. b. T he case was a landmark in the freedom of the press because the jury ignored the corrupt judge and ruled that the printer had the right to print criticism of the governor. Even though the case was a struggle against governmental cor - ruption (choice a), the more important issue was its pla ce in the development of freedom of the press. While book burning (choice c) con - tinues to be an instrument of intimidation, the p ositive outcome of Zenger's acquittal was the more important legacy. With Governor Cosby controlling the judge, though not the jury, the separation of powers (choice d) was not the focal point of this trial. 6. a. T his movement was a clear expression of the philosophy of natural rights, which claims that the right to rule comes from the people. Trans-ferring political power from a foreign colonial p ower to an elected local government would be a real-life example of the philosophy of natural rights. Divine rights is a philosophy proposing that the right to rule comes from a connection with God, a divine power. 7. a. T hat the world population growth rate will begin declining by 2050 is the prediction best supported by the graph. While the total popula-tion will continue to increase, the slope of the line, or rate of growth, will be decreasing. The graph shows that the population growth of the less developed countries is expected to slow down after 2050, not grow rapidly (choice b). The graph shows that the population of the developed countries will remain stable, not col- lapse (choice c). While the graph does show w orld population leveling off, it does not pre- dict a decline (choice d). 8. b. P eople expected that they could not use con-tinentals as money or for anything else. 9. b. Linc oln's motivation, according to most analysis, was to increase the chances of the Union winning the Civil War, since slaves would be freed in those areas in armed rebellion. Lin- coln was morally outraged (choice a) and the ab olition of slavery did help establish his legacy (choice c), but there is no evidence that these were motivations for his actions. While the proclamation helped to recruit former slaves into the Union's armed forces (choice d), that was only one advantage leading to attainment of the main goal, preserving the Union. 10. a. T hat the use of nonviolent direct-action protest was at the heart of the Civil Rights movement is the main idea of the passage. While the writer of the passage would probably agree that nonviolence, as developed by Mahatma Gandhi, is a powerful instrument for gaining rights, this statement is too broad to be the main idea of this passage. 11. d. T he cartoonist hopes that the reaction would be sympathy for the college grad and a desire to help; he urges sympathy in the viewer through a depiction of the just-graduated col- lege student as being pulled under water by the hea vy responsibility of student loan debt. 12. d. Shar ing the power to raise revenue helps keep both levels of government strong and independent and maintains a balance of power. While it is true that the federal and state gov- ernments both need money to operate effec- tively (choice a), one level could grant money to the othe r. While it is true that the federal gov- ernment would be too weak without the power t o raise revenue (choice b), this option does not address the relationship between the federal and state governments. Simply giving it the power to raise revenue does not make the fed-eral government too strong (choice c). 431431 - - SOCIAL STUDIES KNOWLEDGE 13. b. T hree-quarters of 36 states, the number of states at the end of the Civil War, is 27 states. Choice a is incorrect because not all of the states had to ratify the rst ten amendments or Bill of Rights; they were subject to the three-quarters rule. Choice c is incorrect because while 36 states were needed to repeal the 18th amendment, it was because of the three-quar - ters rule, not because of the number of states o riginally needed to ratify the amendment. Choice d is incorrect because once an amend-ment reaches the three-quarters threshold and g oes into effect, no further action is needed if additional states subsequently join the Union. 432432 PA R T V GED\u00aePRACTICE TESTS Try to take the tests in this book under the same conditions you'll have on the actual test day.

Choice a is incorrect. This expression represents 2 fewer than 10 times the number of video games Joseph owns. Choice c is incorrect. This expression represents 2 times 10 fewer than the number of video games Joseph owns. Choice d is incorrect. This expression represents 10 times 2 fewer than the number of video games Joseph owns. 2. Choice c is correct. The product in the n umerator can be written as 3 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 6 3= 36. The 3 in the denominator cancels out the 3 in front of the root. Choice a is incorrect. The numerator is made up of a product. The denominator can only cancel one factor of the numerator. Choice b is incorrect. The denominator cannot cancel out a factor within a cube root. Choice d is incorrect. The cube root of 9 is not 3. 3. C orrect answer: 2 Two factors of 72 are 2 and 36. Further, a a=b for positive numbers a and b. b 72 2 \u00d7 36 = = 2. Using these properties, 3636 y x The rst term of the ordered pair is the x-coordinate.

The original statement can b e written as n + 4 < 5m. Given the value of m, 5m = 5 \u00d7 6 = 30, therefore n + 4 < 30. This can be simplied further, to n < 26. Choice a is incorrect. The original statement can be written as n + 4 < 5m. This statement can be used to show what n is less than, but it can't indicate what n is greater than. Choice b is incorrect. The original statement can be written as n + 4 < 5m. Given the value of m, 5m = 5 \u00d7 6 = 30, therefore n + 4 < 30. While n < 26, it is not necessarily true that n + 4 < 26. Choice d is incorrect. The original statement can be written as n + 4 < 5m. This statement can be used to show what n is less than, but it can't indicate what n is equal to. 7. Correct answer: $490.80. The employee is paid a 4% c ommission on his sales of $1,020. There- fore, he will be paid 0.04 \u00d7 $1,020 = $40.80 for the sales. This is on top of his regular pay of $450. Therefore, his total paycheck will be $450 + $40.80 = $490.80. 8. Choice b is correct. The radius of the circle is 5, and the cir cumference is 2 \u00d7 U \u00d7 (radius), or 10U. This can also be found simply by multiply-ing the diameter and U. C hoice a is incorrect. The radius of the circle is 5 and must be doubled in order to nd the circumference. Choice c is incorrect. This is the area of the circle, which is found by squaring the radius and multiplying by U. Choice d is incorrect. The diameter does not need to be squared in order to nd the circumference. 9. Choice a is correct. A pplying an exponent to a fraction is equivalent to applying that exponent to the numerator and denominator. Choice b is incorrect. An exponent of 3 is not equivalent to multiplication by 3. Choice c is incorrect. The exponent must be applied to both the numerator and the denominator. Choice d is incorrect. An exponent of 3 is not equivalent to multiplication by 3 and would be applied to both the numerator and the denominator. 10. C orrect answer: (0,-14) Since n is parallel to the given line, it must have the same slope, 3. Given this and the point that n passes through, we can use the point-slope formula to determine the equation for n. y - 1 = 3(x - 5) y - 1 = 3x - 15 y = 3x - 14 Now that the equation is in the form y = mx + b , we can see that the y-intercept is -14. By deni- tion, this means that the line passes over the y -axis at the point (0,-14). 11. Choice a is correct. The answer choices are in the f orm y = mx + b. Using the given informa- tion, when x = 4, y = 0, and the slope is m = - 1 2, this gives the equation 0 = - 1(4) + b, which2 has a solution of b = 2. Choice b is incorrect. When solving for the y-intercept b, the -2 must be added to both sides of the equation. Choice c is incorrect. The given point (4,0) is not a y-intercept; it's an x-intercept. The equa- tion y = mx + b uses a y-intercept. Choice d is incorrect. If the x-intercept is (4,0) as given, the y-intercept will be -4 only if the slope is 1. Here the slope is - 1 2 . TEST 12. Choice d is correct. Substituting -1 for the x, f (-1) = 3(-1 - 1)2 + 5 = 3(-2)2 + 5 = 3(4) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17. Choice a is incorrect. When substituting -1 for x, x - 1 represents -1 - 1 = -2, not multiplication. Choice b is incorrect. It is not true that (x - 1) 2 = x2 + 1. Choice c is incorrect. By the order of operations, the subtraction within the parentheses as well as the squaring operation must be performed before the multiplication by 3. 13. Choice c is correct. Using the slope formula ______5x - 1 4 2rst, m = = = . Now, applying the4 - (-2) 6 3 point-slope formula, we have: y - 1 = 2(x - (-2))3 2y - 1 = 3(x + 2) __2 4y - 1 = 3 x + 3 __2 4 2 7y = x + + 1 = x +3 3 3 3 Choice a is incorrect. In the point-slope for - mula, the x1 and y1 must come from the same point. Choice b is incorrect. When the point (-2,1) is used in the point-slope formula, the result is y - 1 = m(x - (-2)). On the right-hand side of this equation, the 2 ends up being positive. Choice d is incorrect. The slope is found 5 - 1using the change in y on the numerator: 4 - (-2) __4 2= = 3.614. Choice c is correct. Using the Pythagorean the orem, the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the ladder and the building is 9, while the length of one leg is 6. This yields the equation 6 2 + b2 = 92 or b2 = 81 - 36 = 45. Therefore, b = 45 ~ 6.7. Choice a is incorrect. The terms in the Pythagorean theorem are squared. Choice b is incorrect. Applying the Pythagorean theorem to this problem yields the equation 6 2 + b2 = 92. The exponent of 2 indicates to multiply the term by itself twice, not multiply by 2. Choice d is incorrect. The length of the ladder represents the hypotenuse, or c, in the Pythago- rean theorem. 15. Choice b is correct. The rate of cooling indicat ed in the graph is the slope of the line passing through the points (0,200) and (4,0). This slope is -50, which implies the material is losing 50 degrees every hour. The slope of the equation in this answer choice is -60, which implies the material is losing 60 degrees every hour, a faster rate of cooling. Choice a is incorrect. This slope would imply that the material is losing 25 degrees every hour, which is a slower rate of cooling. Choice c is incorrect. This slope would imply that the material is losing 10 degrees every hour, which is a slower rate of cooling. Choice d is incorrect. This slope would indicate the material is losing 50 degrees every hour, which is the same rate of cooling that is given in the graph. 446446 - - __ __ MATHEMATICAL REASONING PRACTICE TEST 16. 18. Choice b is correct. Rewriting the equation by 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Hours per Day Spent on E-mail The statement \"50% spent more than 2 hours a day composing or reading emails\" indicates that the median of this data set is 2. This is typically indicated on a box plot by a vertical line in the center of the box. 17. Choice a is correct. Using the two given points, w henever y increases by 2 units, x increases by 5 units. This means the slope must be m = 2 5 (the change in y divided by the change in x). Further, the y-intercept is b = -2. Using the 2equation y = mx + b, we have y = 5 x - 2. Choice b is incorrect. The line rises from left to right; therefore, the slope must be positive. Choice c is incorrect. The x-intercept is not used when writing the equation as y = mx + b. In fact, b represents the y-intercept. Choice d is incorrect. The line rises from left to right; therefore, the slope must be positive. Additionally, the y-intercept is -2 and not 5. subtracting 14 from both sides yields the q uadratic equation x2 - 5x - 14 = 0. The left- hand side of this equation can be factored into (x - 7)(x + 2), indicating that the solutions are 7 and -2. Choice a is incorrect. Once the quadratic equation is rewritten and factored, the zero product rule states that x - 7 = 0 or x + 2 = 0. Therefore one of the solutions is -2 instead of 2. Choices c and d are incorrect. To factor the rewritten quadratic equation, nd factors of 14 that sum to -5 instead of numbers that sum to -14. 19. Choice d is correct. To nd the slope of the line w ith this equation, move the y-variable to one side on its own to put the equation in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope. Adding y to both sides and subtracting 2 from both sides gives the equation y = 10x - 2, so the slope is 10. Choice a is incorrect. The coefcient of x, not the coefcient of y, represents the slope when the equation is written in the form y = mx + b. Choice b is incorrect. The slope cannot be read from the equation in the form it is currently written. Choice c is incorrect. When solving for y to nd the slope, 10 will be divided by 1 and not by 2. 20. Choice c is correct. W hen multiplying terms with the same base, the exponents are added. 1 1 1 4 5+ 2 +2 2 2 2 2 2Therefore 5 \u00d75 = 5 = 5 = 5. Choice a is incorrect. When multiplying terms with the same base, the exponents are added, not subtracted. Choice b is incorrect. When multiplying terms with the same base, the exponents are added, not multiplied. Choice d is incorrect. When multiplying terms with the same base, the exponents are added, not divided. 447447 - - __ ___ MATHEMATICAL REASONING PRACTICE TEST 21.

The slope will be the ne gative reciprocal of the given slope, and b in the equation y = mx + b is -4. Choice a is incorrect. The slope of a perpendicular line will be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the original line. Choice b is incorrect. Parallel lines have the same slope, while perpendicular lines have negative reciprocal slopes. Choice c is incorrect. The term added to the x-term will be the y-intercept, which is not -1. 23. Choice a is correct. The division is equivalent __3\u00d7 2 6to = 2. x 5x 5x Choice b is incorrect. The division of two frac- tions is equivalent to multiplying the rst frac- tion by the reciprocal of the second fraction. Choice c is incorrect. This is the result of multi- plying and not dividing the fractions if the 5 cancelled out. There are no terms that would cancel with the 5. Choice d is incorrect.

The line given in the image above is the only line with a y-intercept of - 1 2 . 28. Choice c is correct. Since z is perpendicular to y = -x + 5, it must have a slope of 1. The given point (0,-2) is a y-intercept since the x-value is 0, so the equation of z must be y = x - 2. Plugging in the given y-value of 5 in the point (x, 5) yields the equation 5 = x - 2, which has the solution x = 7. Choice a is incorrect. The y-intercept of the line is -2 and not 5. A perpendicular line does not necessarily have the same y-intercept. Further, the 5 in the point (x, 5) is a y-value and not an x-value. Choice b is incorrect. The 5 in the point (x, 5) is a y-value and not an x-value. Choice d is incorrect. The y-intercept of the line is -2 and not 5.

Instead, factor - ing, the quadratic formula, or completing the sq uare should be used to solve a quadratic equation like this. 39. Choice c is correct. Subtracting 2 from both sid es yields the solution x > 3. Choice a is incorrect. In this inequality, the 2 is added to the variable. Therefore, when attempt-ing to isolate the x, both sides should not be m ultiplied by 2. Instead, 2 should be subtracted from both sides. Choice b is incorrect. In this inequality, the 2 is added to the variable. Therefore when attempt- ing to isolate the x, 2 should be subtracted from b oth sides instead of being added. Choice d is incorrect. In this inequality, the 2 is added to the variable. Therefore, when attempt-ing to isolate the x, both sides should not be di vided by 2. Instead, 2 should be subtracted from both sides. 40. Choice c is correct. A fter plugging in the given value of x, we must simplify the result using basic operations with fractions: 1 1 9- - \u2014 - 2 - 5 - 10- ____ ____ 2 2 __2 1 1 1 3\u2014 - 1 = \u2014 - \u2014 = -- = 9\u00d7 4 = 36 = 6 4 4 4 4 2 3 6 Choice a is incorrect. When plugging in the given value of x, the 5 is subtracted, not multiplied. Choice b is incorrect. When simplifying a frac-tion over a fraction, the fraction in the numera- tor is multiplied by the reciprocal of the fr action in the denominator. Dividing the frac- tions piece by piece is not a valid method. C hoice d is incorrect. Taking a value to the power of two is not the same as multiplying it by two. Furthermore, a fraction with a denomi- nator of zero is undened, not equal to zero. 41. Choice c is correct. The area of the base is 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 sq uare centimeters. Multiplying this by the height of 8 cm gives us the volume in cubic centimeters: 6 \u00d7 8 = 48. Choice a is incorrect. This is the area of one of the smaller faces. Choice b is incorrect. This is the area of one of the larger faces. Choice d is incorrect. This is the surface area of the given shape. 42. Choice c is correct. Since product 2 had almost $30,000 in sales and p roduct 4 had over $40,000 in sales, the total must be more than $50,000. Choice a is incorrect. The total sales in July for these two products was about $45,000. Choice b is incorrect. The total sales in July for these two products was slightly less than $50,000. Choice d is incorrect. The total sales in July for these two products was about $35,000. 451451 - - MATHEMATICAL REASONING PRACTICE TEST 43. Choice b is correct. Using the surface area formula: 36 U = 4Ur2 29 = r r = 3 Since the radius is 3, the diameter is 3 \u00d7 2 = 6. Choice a is incorrect. This is the radius of the sphere. The diameter is twice as large as the radius. Choice c is incorrect. When solving the equation 36U = 4Ur 2, divide, do not multiply, both sides by 4. Additionally, the diameter will be two times as large as the radius. Choice d is incorrect. When solving the equation 36U = 4Ur 2, divide, do not multiply, both sides by 4. 44. Choice b is correct. Using the addition method, a dding the two equations yields the equation 2x = 22, which has a solution of x = 11. Choice a is incorrect. Subtracting the two equations will eliminate the x from both equations, making it where y must be found rst. Choice c is incorrect. If there were innitely many solutions, the equations would be multiples of each other. Choice d is incorrect. If there was no solution, the equation would yield an incorrect statement such as 0 = 1 or -5 = 3. 45. Choice a is correct. Distributing the negative and c ombining like terms yields (x2 + 5) - 2(x - x) = x2 + 5 - x2 - (-x) = 5 + x. Choice b is incorrect. The negative must be distributed to every term in the parentheses. Choice c is incorrect. Since the second term is being subtracted, the x 2 terms will cancel out. Further, the 5 and the x are not being multiplied. Choice d is incorrect. Since the second term is being subtracted, the x 2 terms will cancel out. 452452 16 ReasoningchapterThRough Language aRTs (RLa) PRaCTiCe TesT This practice test is modeled on the format, content, and timing of the ofcial GED\u00ae Reasoning through Language Arts test.

May 3, 2013 1 Thank you for supporting our far mers and our ranchers and working tirelessly to market their products across the globe, which, by the way, helps to create jobs right here at home. Thank you for protecting our environment by promoting renewable energy sources that will power our coun- try for generations to come. So that's an impact on not just us but our children and our grandchil-dren and their children. Thank you for that work. Thank you for lifting up rural communities. And t hank you for keeping our food safe. And I think this is something most of the country doesn't realize\u2014the work that you do here to protect the environment, you keep our food safe, working to end hunger, improve nutrition for families across this country. 2 And the nutrition issue, as T om mentioned, as you all know, is something near and dear to my heart, not just as First Lady but as a mother. In fact, one of the first things that I did as, you know, as First Lady, was to plant the garden at the White House. And it's really pretty. [Laughter.] I hope you guys get a chance to see it\u2014it's beautiful now. It rained a couple of days. Thank you. [Laugh- ter.] And the idea with planting the garden wasn't just to encourage kids to eat more vegetables. I also wanted to teach them about wher e their food comes from. 3 I think you've known this\u2014we see this as we traveled ar ound the country\u2014some kids have never seen what a real tomato looks like off the vine. They don't know where a cucumber comes from. And that really affects the way they view food. So a garden helps them really get their hands dirty, literally, and understand the whole process of where their food comes from. And I wanted them to see just how challenging and rewarding it is to grow your own food, so that they would better understand what our farmers are doing every single day across this country and have an appre- ciation for that work, that tradition\u2014that American tradition of growing our own food and feeding ourselves. 4 And t he garden helped spark a conversation in this country about healthy eating that led us to create Let's Move. As you know, it's a nationwide initiative to end childhood obesity in this coun- try in a generation, so that all of our kids can grow up healthy. And all of you all at USDA, let me j ust tell you, have been such a critical part of this effort right from the very start. This would not happen\u2014all the conversation, all the movement around health\u2014that's all because of so many of you right here in this room and throughout this building, and in agencies and facilities all over this country. You helped to launch our new MyPlate icon, which is changing the way families serve their meals and gives them a really easy way to understand what a healthy plate looks like. 454454 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST 1.

Excerpt from \"The Cask of Amontillado,\" by Edgar Allan Poe 1 He had a weak point\u2014this Fortunato\u2014although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit. For the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity, to practice imposture upon the British and Austrian millionaires. In painting and gemmary, Fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. In this respect I did not differ from him materially\u2014I was skillful in the Italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever I could. 2 It w as about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that I encoun - tered my friend. He accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. The man w ore motley. He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should never have done wring- ing his hand. 3 I said to him\u2014\"My dear Fortunato, you are luckily met. How remarkably well you are looking to- day. But I have received a pipe of what passes for Amontillado, and I have my doubts.\" 4 \"How?\" said he. \"Amontillado, a pipe? Impossible! And in the middle of the car nival!\" 5 \"I have my doubts,\" I replied, \"and I was silly enough to pay the full Amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. You were not to be found, and I was fearful of losing a bargain.\" 6 \"Amontillado!\" 7 \"I have my doubts.\" 8 \"Amontillado!\" \"And I must satisfy them.\" 10 \"Amontillado!\" 11 \"As you ar e engaged, I am on my way to Luchresi. If anyone has a critical turn it is he. He will tell me\u2014\" 12 \"Luchresi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry.\" 13 \"And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own. 14 \"Come, let us go.\" 15 \"Whither?\" 16 \"To your vaults.\" 17 \"My friend, no; I will not impose upon your good natur e . I perceive you have an engagement. Luchresi\u2014\" 18 \"I have no engagement\u2014come.\" 19 \"My friend, no. It is not the engagement but the sever e cold with which I perceive you are afflicted. The vaults are insufferably damp. They are encrusted with nitre.\" 20 \"Let us go, nevertheless. The cold is mer e ly nothing. Amontillado! You have been imposed upon. And as for Luchresi, he cannot distinguish Sherry from Amontillado.\" 21 Thus speaking, Fortunato possessed himself of my ar m ; and putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person, I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo. 456456 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST 7. Who are Fortunato's \"countrymen\"? a. Italians b. Britons c. Austrians d. Spaniards 8. What do Fortunato and the narrator have in c ommon? a. an interest in Italian history b. they are wearing the same clothing c. a passion for wine d. a love of the carnival season 9. Which statement, in context, is NOT supporting ev idence that Fortunato has a passion for wine? a. \"But in the matter of old wines he was sinc ere.\" b. \"I was so pleased to see him that I thought I should ne ver have done wringing his hand.\" c. \"Luchresi cannot tell Amontillado from She rry.\" d. \"The cold is merely nothing.

Why does the narrator rst insist that he will ask L uchresi's opinion of the Amontillado? a. because Luchresi has more expertise in wine than F ortunato does b. because Fortunato and the narrator are kno wn enemies c. to gain the trust of Fortunato d. to prey on Fortunato's pride Please use the following to answer questions 12-16. Excerpt from \"My First Lie, and How I Got Out of It,\" by Mark Twain 1 I do not r emember my first lie, it is too far back; but I remember my second one very well. I was nine days old at the time, and had noticed that if a pin was sticking in me and I advertised it in the usual fashion, I was lovingly petted and coddled and pitied in a most agreeable way and got a ration between meals besides. 2 It was human nature to want to get these riches, and I fell. I lied about the pin\u2014advertising one when there wasn't any. You would have done it; George Washington did it, anybody would have done it. During the first half of my life I never knew a child that was able to raise above that temp - tation and keep from telling that lie. Up to 1867 all the civilized children that were ever born into t he world were liars\u2014including George. Then the safety pin came in and blocked the game. But is that reform worth anything? No; for it is reform by force and has no virtue in it; it merely stops that form of lying, it doesn't impair the disposition to lie, by a shade. It is the cradle application of conversion by fire and sword, or of the temperance principle through prohibition. 3 To return to that early lie. They found no pin and they realized that another liar had been added t o the world's supply. For by grace of a rare inspiration a quite commonplace but seldom noticed (continues) 457457 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST fact was borne in upon their understandings\u2014that almost all lies are acts, and speech has no part i n them. Then, if they examined a little further they recognized that all people are liars from the cradle onward, without exception, and that they begin to lie as soon as they wake in the morning, and keep it up without rest or refreshment until they go to sleep at night. If they arrived at that truth it probably grieved them\u2014did, if they had been heedlessly and ignorantly educated by their books and teachers; for why should a person grieve over a thing which by the eternal law of his make he cannot help? He didn't invent the law; it is merely his business to obey it and keep it still; join the universal conspiracy and keep so still that he shall deceive his fellow-conspirators into imagining that he doesn't know that the law exists. It is what we all do\u2014we that know. I am speak- ing of the lie of silent assertion; we can tell it without saying a word, and we all do it\u2014we that know. In the magnitude of its territorial spread it is one of the most majestic lies that the civilizations make it their sacred and anxious care to guard and watch and propagate. 4 For instance. It would not be possible for a humane and intelligent person to invent a rational excuse for slavery; yet you will remember that in the early days of the emancipation agitation in the North the agitators got but small help or countenance from anyone. Argue and plead and pray as they might, they could not break the universal stillness that reigned, from pulpit and press all the way down to the bottom of society\u2014the clammy stillness created and maintained by the lie of silent assertion\u2014the silent assertion that there wasn't anything going on in which humane and intelligent people were interested. 12.

For I have sworn before you the same sol- emn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago. 3 The world is very dif ferent now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life. And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe. 4 We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from t his time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans\u2014born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage\u2014and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world. 5 Let every nation know , whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty. 6 This much we pledge\u2014and mor e. 7 To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful f riends.

And while this reply stated that it s eemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack. 5 It will be r ecorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago. During the intervening time, the Japanese government has deliberately sought to deceive the United States by false statements and expres- sions of hope for continued peace. 6 The attack yester day on the Hawaiian Islands has caused severe damage to American naval and military forces. I regret to tell you that very many American lives have been lost. In addition, American ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between San Francisco and Honolulu. 7 Yester day, the Japanese government also launched an attack against Malaya.

(1) Beginning next week, we will poll the ofce in order to receive everyone's input as we modify work hours. The company (2) they want to change the schedule in order to better fit the needs of the employ- ees. We will have three options to choose from. The first option is to keep the work schedule as i t is currently: 9 to 5, Monday through Friday. The second option is to work one more hour per day on Monday through Thursday, but work only half a day on Friday. The third option is to work two extra hours on Monday through Thursday, and have Fridays off. Although (3) completely open to all three options, the members of the executive board feel that t he second option may fit the goals of the company and employees the best. Many of us already stay to work late at the beginning of the week, and the extra hour would not feel unnatural. We have also noticed that on (4). We understand this to be normal behavior and want to alter hours so that we can better serve you. We think that the second option would fit well with the patterns we have already observed; how- ever, we still want your opinions. We will be sending questionnaires via email for you to fill out w ithin the week. Please take some time to think about your responses before completing the survey as we want the possible change to best reflect the needs of the office. Please keep a lookout for the questionnaire and return it to us by the end of next week. Thank you for your time, Alexandra Chandler 464464 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST 31.

It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted, for those that prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things\u2014some cele- brated, but more often men and women obscure in their labor\u2014who have carried us up the long rugged path towar ds prosperity and freedom. 2 For us, they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled acr oss oceans in search of a new life. For us, they toiled in sweatshops, and settled the West, endured the lash of the whip, and plowed the hard earth. For us, they fought and died in places like Concord and Gettysburg, Normandy and Khe Sahn. 3 Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were r aw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions, greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction. 4 This is the jour ney we continue today. We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week, or last month, or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions\u2014that time has surely passed. Starting today, we must pick our - selves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America. 5 For everywher e we look, there is work to be done. The state of our economy calls for action, bold and swift. And we will act, not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth. We (continues) 465465 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and b ind us together. We'll restore science to its rightful place and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. All this we will do. 6 Now , there are some who question the scale of our ambitions, who suggest that our system can- not tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short, for they have forgotten what this c ountry has already done, what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage. What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them, that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. 7 The question we ask today is not whether our gover nment is too big or too small, but whether it works\u2014whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified. Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end. And those of us who manage the public's dollars will be held to account, to spend wisely, reform bad habits, and do our business in the light of day, because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government. Excerpt from Barack Obama's Second Inaugural Address, January 21, 2013 1 We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity. We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit. But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future. For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty, and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn. We do not believe that in this country, freedom is reserved for the lucky, or hap- piness for the few. We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us, a t any time, may face a job loss, or a sudden illness, or a home swept away in a terrible storm. The commitments we make to each other\u2014through Medicare, and Medicaid, and Social Secu- rity\u2014these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they fr ee us to take the risks that make this country great. 2 We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all p osterity. We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms. The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries\u2014we must claim its promise. (continues) 466466 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST That's how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure\u2014our forests and water - ways; our croplands and snowcapped peaks. That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our car e by God. That's what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared. 3 We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual w ar. Our brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are unmatched in skill and courage. Our citizens, seared by the memory of those we have lost, know too well the price that is paid for liberty. The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm. But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war, who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends, and we must carry those lessons into this time as well. 4 We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law. We w ill show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully\u2014not because we are na\u00efve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear. America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe; and we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation. We will support democracy from Asia to Africa; from the Americas to the Middle East, because our interests and our con- science compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom. And we must be a source of h ope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice\u2014not out of mere charity, but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes: tolerance and opportunity; human dignity and justice. 35.

Remarks upon Signing the Civil Rights Bill (July 2, 1964), Lyndon Baines Johnson 1 My fellow Americans: 2 I am about to sign into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964. I want to take this occasion to talk to you about what that law means to every American. 3 One hundr ed and eighty-eight years ago this week a small band of valiant men began a long struggle for freedom. They pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor not only to found a nation, but to forge an ideal of freedom\u2014not only for political independence, but for personal liberty\u2014not only to eliminate foreign rule, but to establish the rule of justice in the affairs of men. 4 That struggle was a tur ning point in our history. Today in far corners of distant continents, the ideals of those American patriots still shape the struggles of men who hunger for freedom. 5 This is a pr oud triumph. Yet those who founded our country knew that freedom would be secure only if each generation fought to renew and enlarge its meaning. From the minutemen at Concord to the soldiers in Viet-Nam, each generation has been equal to that trust. 6 Americans of every race and color have died in battle to pr otect our freedom. Americans of every race and color have worked to build a nation of widening opportunities. Now our generation of Americans has been called on to continue the unending search for justice within our own borders. 7 We believe that all men ar e created equal. Yet many are denied equal treatment. 8 We believe that all men have certain unalienable rights. Yet many Americans do not enjoy those rights. 9 We believe that all men are entitled to the blessings of liberty. Yet millions are being deprived of those blessings\u2014not because of their own failur es, but because of the color of their skin. 10 The reasons are deeply imbedded in history and tradition and the nature of man. We can under - stand\u2014without rancor or hatr ed\u2014how this all happened. 11 But it cannot continue. Our Constitution, the foundation of our Republic, forbids it. The principles of our freedom forbid it. Morality forbids it. And the law I will sign tonight forbids it. 469469 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST 43.

An Analysis of Nuclear Energy 1 America runs on energy. As a matter of fact, the United States is the second largest energy con- sumer in the world, behind China. In recent years, it can be argued that we need to ease our d ependence on foreign countries that supply us with oil and develop energy at home. But where can we get the energy we need? Benefits of Nuclear Energy 2 The U.S. Department of Ener gy (DOE) promotes the development of safe, domestic nuclear power, and there are many who support the idea that nuclear power is the answer. Compared to fossil fuels such as gas, coal, and oil, nuclear energy is the most efficient way to make electricity. For example, the Idaho National Laboratory reports that \"one uranium fuel pellet\u2014roughly the size of the tip of an adult's little finger\u2014contains the same amount of energy as 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas, 1,780 pounds of coal, or 149 gallons of oil.\" 3 Supporters of nuclear energy cite that nuclear generators don't create the great amounts of poi- sonous carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide like the burning of fossil fuels does. T he DOE reports that a nuclear generator produces 30 tons of spent fuel a year compared to the 300,000 tons of coal ash produced by a coal-powered electrical plant. 4 In terms of safety, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ensures that each and every nuclear reac- tor maintains strict safety standards. Radioactive waste is contained deep underground behind s teel-reinforced, 1.2-meter-thick concrete walls. The DOE also points out that \"ash from burning coal at a power plant emits 100 times more radiation into the surrounding environment than a nuclear power plant.\" (continues) 471471 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST Arguments against Nuclear Energy 5 Opponents of nuclear ener gy argue that nuclear reactors endanger all life on Earth for three basic reasons. First, nuclear radioactivity is deadly and must be contained for thousands of years. Sec - ond, no matter how many safety measures are in place, accidents happen, and nuclear meltdowns a re global environmental catastrophes. Finally, nuclear fuel used to generate electricity can also be used to build atomic bombs. 6 Nuclear generators used radioactive plutonium and uranium for fuel. Scientists say that exposur e to a millionth of an ounce of pluntonium causes cancer. Even nuclear energy proponents agree that life-threatening nuclear waste must be contained for half a million years before it becomes safe to be around. Radioactive dumps last generations. 7 Opponents of nuclear energy also cite the ever-present threat of meltdowns. Widespread radioac - tive contamination and death caused by the nuclear accidents at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, a nd Fukushima are cautionary lessons. Researchers disagree on how possible it is to safely contain radioactivity, but it's undeniable that nuclear meltdown causes widespread contamination of the air, water, and land with deadly radioactivity. It is also verifiable that nuclear accidents have caused environmental catastrophes that continue to this day. 8 Perhaps even mor e disturbing than the threat of toxic waste and meltdown is the use of uranium for sinister purposes. On December 7, 2013, Reuters reported that \". . . in news that may concern world powers . . . Iran is moving ahead with testing more efcient uranium enrichment technology. . . .\" Indeed, the United Nations and the entire world are worried about Iran's enhancement of uranium for use in nuclear power plants because the same enhanced uranium can be used to build atomic weaponry. 9 Opponents argue that in the same way we learned that fossil fuels are limited and destroy the environment, so must we learn from nuclear disasters. Opponents say the answer is to develop safe, clean, and renewable sources of alternative energy, such as solar, wind, tidal, and geother - mal power. Why gamble? The future of the world is at stake. ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST QUESTION: Nuclear energy proponents argue that it is safe and efcient, while opponents make the case for alternative e nergy sources, citing the deadly consequences of nuclear disaster.

Choice d is correct. This is the only answer that e ncompasses everything Mrs. Obama speaks about, from thanking the USDA employees to explaining how the healthy initiatives could not succeed without them. Choice a is incorrect. Although Mrs. Obama discusses different programs she has created with that goal, she uses those examples to demonstrate the greater theme. Choice b is incorrect. Mrs. Obama shows her appreciation for farmers, but this answer ignores many other ideas and information brought up throughout the passage. Choice c is incorrect. Mrs. Obama mentions the Let's Move initiative, but it is clear from her comments that the initiative is already underway; therefore, the purpose of Mrs. Obama's remarks is not to introduce Let's Move. 2. According to Mrs. Obama, a man named Tom me ntioned that the nutrition issue is something near and dear to her heart. In the second para-graph, Mrs. Obama states: \". . . the nutrition iss ue, as Tom mentioned, as you all know, is something near and dear to my heart . . .\" 3. Choice b is correct. Selecting this answer choice sho ws that the reader comprehends the importance Mrs. Obama places on family and healthy habits. Choice a is incorrect. This answer ignores the main topics of the passage, which include an emphasis on participating in an active lifestyle, not watching one. Choice c is incorrect. This answer choice only identies one theme and ignores the focus on nutrition. Choice d is incorrect. Although this answer incorporates both the themes of family and having healthy habits, it disregards Mrs. Obama's emphasis on teaching children healthy habits. 4. Choice a is correct. Even though Mrs. Obama is stat ing another of the USDA 's contributions, this answer does not focus on health or food, but rather on renewable resources. Also, the other three answer choices clearly support the question's conclusion. Choice b is incorrect. This sentence demonstrates Mrs. Obama's concern through her gratitude. Choice c is incorrect. This statement explicitly states Mrs. Obama's personal interest in health in the United States. Choice d is incorrect. In this sentence, Mrs. Obama gives a specic example of the ways in which she, along with the USDA, has worked to teach citizens healthy habits. 5. Choice a is correct. If you replace the word \"init iative\" with the word \"program,\" the sen- tence would retain its meaning. C hoice b is incorrect. The word \"enthusiasm\" does not t the context. Choice c is incorrect. \"Disinterest\" is an ant-onym of \"initiative.\" C hoice d is incorrect. Replacing \"initiative\" with \"involvement\" loses the meaning of the sentence. 480480 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST 6. Choice b is correct. It demonstrates the ne cessity of garden programs by highlighting the fact that some children don't know how food is grown or where their food comes from. Choice a is incorrect. This response neglects Mrs. Obama's emphasis on why nutritional programs are important. Choice c is incorrect. The paragraph supports the theme of the speech by providing information about why the programs and worker involvement are necessary. Choice d is incorrect. Mrs. Obama is very clear and explicitly states that children not only do not know about nutrition, but do not know where their food comes from. This ties into the overall theme of health and demonstrates why Mrs. Obama believes these programs are needed. 7. Choice a is correct. Two sentences before \" countrymen,\" the narrator says, \"Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.\" The next few sen-tences, including the one that uses \"country-men,\" are descriptions of traits that Italians do o r do not have, according to the narrator. Choice b is incorrect. Two sentences before \"countrymen,\" the narrator says \"Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.\" The next few sen- tences discuss how the enthusiasm of many Ital- ians is often a deception to take advantage of the B ritish or Austrians, according to the narrator. Choice c is incorrect. Two sentences before \"countrymen,\" the narrator says \"Few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.\" The next few sen- tences discuss how the enthusiasm of many Ital- ians is often a deception to take advantage of the B ritish or Austrians, according to the narrator. Choice d is incorrect. There is no mention or indication in the passage that Fortunato is a Spaniard. 8. Choice c is correct. The narrator states that F ortunato is \"sincere\" in his knowledge of \"old wines,\" and that in \"This respect I did not differ from him materially.\" Choice a is incorrect. At no point does the narrator say anything about Italian history. Choice b is incorrect. The narrator describes Fortunato's \"parti-striped dress,\" but does not describe his own clothing. Choice d is incorrect. The narrator states the events happened \"one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season,\" but makes no declarations about his feelings at the time. 9. Choice b is correct. This describes the nar rator's reaction to nding Fortunato, not Fortunato's feelings about wine. Choice a is incorrect. The narrator is clearly stating Fortunato knows about wine. Choice c is incorrect. Fortunato is attempting to prove that he knows about wines and convince the narrator to take him to the cask of Amontillado instead of to their friend Luchresi. Choice d is incorrect. After the narrator warns Fortunato that his health would be in danger if they went to nd the vault because of the cold, Fortunato dismisses the concern in favor of the wine. 10. Choice c is correct. Fortunato is actually quite unl ucky as he has just stumbled across a man who wants to, and later does, kill him. Choice a is incorrect. The narrator is being sincere. Choice b is incorrect. This is a follow-up statement used to explain the narrator's claim that \"few Italians have the true virtuoso spirit.\" Choice d is incorrect. Although the narrator does not actually mean to deter Fortunato from the journey to his death, there is no text-based reason to believe that the vaults are not cold and wet. 481481 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST 11. Choice d is correct. Early in the text, the nar rator states that Fortunato \"had a weak point\u2014this Fortunato\u2014although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseur-ship in wine.\" Choice a is incorrect. There is nothing in the text that indicates Luchresi has more expertise in wine than Fortunato. As a matter of fact, the narrator himself states that \"in the matter of old wines [Fortunato] was sincere.\" Choice b is incorrect. On the contrary, if the narrator and Fortunato were known enemies, Fortunato would not trust him and follow him down to the vault. Choice c is incorrect. The two men already know and trust each other, which is evidenced in their interactions and dialogue. 12. Choice c is correct. The author suggests that b efore 1867 many babies were poked by pins, and then the safety pin came along and eliminated the problem. It can be inferred that the reason the earlier babies were being poked was because their diapers were fastened with straight pins. Choice a is incorrect. The only connection the author makes between himself and George Washington is that he, like Washington, was born into the world a liar. Choice b is incorrect. Although the author suggests that before 1867 infants were often poked by pins, he does not imply that pin-poking was a form of parental punishment. Choice d is incorrect. Although the author states that safety pins made children unable to \"lie\" by crying as if they had been poked by a pin, the author also states that this \"doesn't impair the disposition to lie.\" 13. Choice b is correct. The author states, \"During the r st half of my life I never knew a child that was able to raise above that temptation and keep from telling that lie.\" Choice a is incorrect. The author offers no scientic data to support his claim. Choice c is incorrect. The author does not present any physical evidence to support his claim. Choice d is incorrect. Although the author states that George Washington lied as a child, he offers no historical documentation to support this statement. 14. Choice d is correct. The author states that \"all p eople are liars from the cradle onward\" and also asks, \"[W]hy should a person grieve over a thing which by the eternal law of his make he cannot help?\" Choice a is incorrect. The author does not suggest that lying should be forbidden and, in fact, argues that stopping a person from lying does not remove a person's disposition to lie. Choice b is incorrect. The author does not suggest that different rules should be applied to adults and children. Choice c is incorrect. The author does not suggest that eliminating lying is a goal toward which people should strive. 482482 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST 15. Choice a is correct. The author argues that those w ho didn't speak up about slavery implied \"that there wasn't anything going on in which humane and intelligent people were interested,\" which was a quiet way of countering anti-slavery activists. Choice b is incorrect. The author does not mention economics as an issue related to slavery. Choice c is incorrect. The author does not suggest that slave owners lied to others; the main idea of the paragraph is that people lied to themselves about slavery. Choice d is incorrect. The author says that anti- slavery agitators in the North would \"argue and plea d and pray,\" but they didn't get enough sup- port in response. 16. Choice b is correct. W hile this detail is mentioned in the passage, it does not reflect the main idea of the passage, which is that lying is a part of human nature. Choices a, b, and c are incorrect. These details support the main idea of the passage, which is that lying is a part of human nature. 17. Choice a is correct. A ll three words need to be capitalized. Beginning letters of sentences are always capitalized, and people's names and titles are capitalized. Choice b is incorrect. This answer lacks all necessary capitalization. All three words need to be capitalized. Beginning letters of sentences are always capitalized, and people's names and titles are capitalized. Choices c and d are incorrect. All three words must be capitalized. 18. Choice c is correct. This is the correct past t ense for a singular subject. Choice a is incorrect. \"I have to work with chil-dren\" does not make sense within the context. T he author is explaining what she has done in the past. Choices b and d are incorrect. These answer choices do not make sense in context. 19. Choice a is correct. This word correctly mat ches the past-tense verb \"nannied.\" Choice b is incorrect. This does not t in context with the past-tense verb \"nannied.\" Choice c is incorrect. The word \"however\" indi-cates contrast with a previous statement. The id eas in the sentence compliment previous sen- tences and do not offer contrast. C hoice d is incorrect. This answer choice does not make sense in context. In order to keep with form, \"recently\" is a better answer. 20. Choice c is correct. \"M y\" is the correct posses- sive pronoun. C hoice a is incorrect. This is not the correct possessive pronoun. The speaker is talking about her abilities. Choice b is incorrect. \"Me\" is not a possessive pronoun. It is clear that the abilities belong to someone. Choice d is incorrect. Although \"mine\" is pos- sessive, one uses it to indicate objects that b elong to them, and it would be awkward to say \"mine abilities.\" 483483 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST 21. Choice a is correct. This choice summarizes the passag e in totality, identifying Kennedy's emphasis on the past and the present as he accepts the presidency. Choice b is incorrect. This choice neglects Kennedy's focus on the future of the nation and the world. Choice c is incorrect. Kennedy stresses hope and good things to come throughout the text; however, this is just a small slice of everything he says and is not the main theme. Choice d is incorrect. Although Kennedy speaks about the United States' and its allies' role in furthering peace and democracy, this choice ignores the weight Kennedy puts on how the past shaped the country. 22. Choice c is correct. The use of \"replaced\" and \" more\" signies that \"colonial control\" and \"tyranny\" mean similar things. Choice a is incorrect. The sentence is addressed \"to the new states\"; this is who the promise of a guard against more tyranny is made. Choice b is incorrect. This phrase represents the opposite of tyranny, the state to which the countries have been \"welcomed\" to. The second half of the sentence is a promise to protect them and guard against tyranny. Choice d is incorrect. \"Iron\" is an adjective used to describe tyranny. 23. Choice a is correct. Kennedy is contrasting b eing united with being divided in order to make a point about why countries should cooperate (because they can accomplish anything \"in a host of cooperative ventures\"). Choice b is incorrect. This is the opposite of Kennedy's intention. Choice c is incorrect. Kennedy is focusing on everyone working together and not on foreign policy. Choice d is incorrect. Although Kennedy says that he is committed to peace and cooperation, this speech focuses on discussing the perils of not working together. 24. Choice 2 is correct. Many times Kennedy e mphasizes doing what is necessary to help those in need and that the United States will \"pay any price.\" Choice 3 is correct. Kennedy stresses that he is committed to showing people who are \"strug- gling\" how to \"help themselves\" and wants to \" assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty.\" Choice 4 is correct. Kennedy states he pledges the United States' \"best efforts\" not for political reasons \"but because it is right.\" He also says he wants to \"convert our good words into good deeds.\" Choice 1 is incorrect. Kennedy makes a point of saying that the United States will \"pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty.\" This does not show fear. Choice 5 is incorrect. In the last paragraph, Kennedy explicitly asks \"that both sides begin anew the quest for peace.\" He does not threaten his opponents but rather warns against the con- sequences of not working together. 484484 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST 25. Choice a is correct. Roosevelt emphasizes that the atta ck was a complete surprise because the two nations were not warring, yet states that he has \"directed that all measures be taken for our defense.\" Even though he was not expecting the event, he knows that \"hostilities exist\" and has handled the situation. Choice b is incorrect. Roosevelt says the United States has \"condence in our armed forces\" and \"determination of our people\" and will \"gain the inevitable triumph.\" These are not words of a timid or fearful person. Choice c is incorrect. Although he asserts many times that the attack came as a surprise, he does not show fear through his words. Rather, he shows condence in the country. Choice d is incorrect. Some of what Roosevelt says is aggressive, like asking Congress to declare war, but he seems condent in the abilities of the nation rather than insecure. 26. Choice c is correct. Roosevelt is effectively st ressing how \"the United States was at peace with that nation\" by emphatically pointing out that the Japanese ambassador responded to the American message. Choice a is incorrect. The third paragraph is an example that there were \"existing diplomatic negotiations,\" an example of how Japan was \"still in conversation,\" as stated in the previous paragraph. Choice b is incorrect. The third paragraph supports the premise of the second paragraph. Choice d is incorrect. The third paragraph supports the theme of the previous paragraphs. 27. Choice b is correct. Roosevelt is implying that the tw o islands are far enough apart that the attack had to have been \"deliberately planned.\" Choice a is incorrect. The attack wouldn't have had to have been planned \"days or even weeks ago\" if the island was close and easy for the Jap- anese to attack. C hoice c is incorrect. The United States mainland is not mentioned and is irrelevant in this context. Choice d is incorrect. There is no evidence in the speech to support this answer choice. The opposite is true. 28. Choice d is correct. The drumbeat rhythm of r epetition emphasizes the great number of attacks on one country after another. Choice a is incorrect. There is no evidence in the speech that Japan is disorganized. In fact, evidence in the speech supports the conclusion that the opposite is true. Choice b is incorrect. There is no evidence in the speech to support this conclusion. Choice c is incorrect. There is no mention of how the other countries handled or will handle the attack. 29. Choice b is correct. Roosevelt states many t imes that the attack was an intentional move that put \"our interests . . . in grave danger.\" Choice a is incorrect. Contrary to this answer choice, evidence in the speech supports the conclusion that Japan launched a surprise attack on the United States. Choice c is incorrect. There is no evidence in the speech to support this conclusion. Choice d is incorrect. It is clear from the speech that the attack was planned. 485485 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST 30. Choice d is correct. This sentence comes after d escribing how the surprise attack was carried out, acknowledging resulting clear and present danger. Choice a is incorrect. An attack is not expected from a nation in peaceful accord with the United States. Choice b is incorrect. This sentence shows that the nations were working together to nd a solution prior to the attack. Choice c is incorrect. This sentence describes how Japan worked to make sure the attack was a surprise by deceiving the United States. 31. Choice b is correct. The tone is appropriate for a w ork email. Choice a is incorrect. The phrases \"some really big\" and \"that might really affect\" are informal and awkward. Choice c is incorrect. The tone is too informal for a work email. Choice d is incorrect. A postscript (PS) comes at the end of a letter, not at the beginning. 32. Choice b is correct. This is the past participle v erb. The decision \"has\" already been made. Choice a is incorrect. This is the future tense, and the decision has already been made. Choice c is incorrect. This is the present tense, and the action is not happening now. Choice d is incorrect. This is the present tense of the verb. 33. Choice d is correct. The plural pronoun mat ches the plural form of the verb. The contraction of these two words is \"they're\" and is a homophone of \"there\" and \"they're.\" Choice a is incorrect. The word \"there\" refers to location. Choice b is incorrect. \"Their\" is a possessive pronoun. Choice c is incorrect. Although this has the correct plural pronoun, \"is\" is for singular subjects. 34. Choice c is correct. This answer correctly closes o ff the thought from the rst part of the sentence before introducing the second part of the sentence. It shows a natural pause. Choice a is incorrect. \"Friday\" modies \"after - noons,\" so they cannot be broken up by a c omma. Choice b is incorrect. \"Employee\" serves as an adjective for \"activity.\" They cannot be separated. Choice d is incorrect. \"Activity\" is the noun and \"drops\" is the verb. They should not be separated. 35. Choice b is correct. Obama remarks that g reatness is not a given and must be earned, implying that the United States is not great by luck, but by work and determination. Choice a is incorrect. The future of our great nation is assured. Choice c is incorrect. The future is not mentioned in the rst paragraph. Choice d is incorrect. Obama does not discuss his personal feelings about being president in the address. 36. Choice d is correct. The sentence later in the passag e recalls the men and women mentioned earlier to stress that the cynics are wrong in thinking great things cannot be accomplished. Choice a is incorrect. Although this answer recognizes the theme of the sentence, that the United States has a large and historical \"capac- ity\" for greatness, it does not explicitly call on the imag e of the people working or modify that idea. Choice b is incorrect. This choice neglects the connection Obama makes between the people who worked hard to shape America and the cynics who are ignoring their struggles by doubting change. Choice c is incorrect. This phrase in the question has nothing to do with the cost of healthcare or technology. 486486 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST 37. Choice 1 is correct. The main idea in the A ddress is that America was formed by hard work and that that attitude needs to and will be continued throughout this presidency. This phrase supports the main idea by rmly stating that taking the easy way out is not what \"our journey\" has been about. Choice 2 is correct. This phrase supports the theme of the future of the United States. Choice 3 is correct. This phrase supports the idea that citizens and the government must work hard and will work hard. Choice 4 is incorrect. This phrase is about renewable energy, which is used as a detail of what Obama wants to focus on and is not the main focus. Choice 5 is incorrect. This phrase stresses the negative and opposition to progress; it does not support the idea of ambition. 38. Choice d is correct. Obama draws on the hist ory of the United States, like \"the creed our fathers once declared,\" to stress that citizens have an \"obligation\" to help \"all posterity.\" Choice a is incorrect. Although Obama does carefully praise the country throughout, the point of the passage is to discuss the future challenges and how past successes enable us to face those challenges. Choice b is incorrect. This answer shows that the reader does not comprehend that the main focus of the text is what Obama believes needs to change. Choice c is incorrect. This is the tool Obama is utilizing, not the effect of utilizing that tool. 39. Choice b is correct. Obama uses words, or r hetoric, to show that he thinks the two are connected and that their interests both matter. Choice a is incorrect. This choice neglects the verb tense change of \"built\" to \"will build.\" This shows he is talking about past people/actions and future people/actions. Choice c is incorrect. This sentence makes no value judgment on either party and does not state one is better than the other. Choice d is incorrect. One generation's actions are in the past, as \"built\" is the past tense verb; their work is done. 40. Choice b is correct. Obama is looking to the fu ture, arguing that failure to act to halt climate change would \"betray our children and future generations.\" Choice a is incorrect. In this sentence, Obama looks to the past for solutions to today's problems. Choice c is incorrect. Here, Obama draws on the past as a reason United States citizens must ght for the future. Choice d is incorrect. Obama is stressing American might and willingness to use its power, not speaking of obligations to future generations. 41. Choice b is correct. Specically, Obama says, \" We will support democracy from Asia to Africa; from the Americas to the Middle East. . . .\" Choices a, b, and c are incorrect. Obama says, \"We will support democracy from Asia to Africa; from the Americas to the Middle East. . . .\" 487487 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST 42. Choice b is correct. This sentence supports the r st address's theme of continuing the hard work of the past in order to secure prosperity and freedom for tomorrow. Choice a is incorrect. This sentence refers to healthcare and taking care of the country's citi- zens; this is mentioned in the rst address, but it is not the the me. Choice c is incorrect. Obama's First Inaugural Address did not focus on war. Choice d is incorrect. These details are not the theme of the rst address. 43. Choice d is correct. I t is not an American ideal to deny freedom. The opposite is true. Freedom is the theme of American ideals. Choice a is incorrect. This American ideal is cited in paragraph 7. Choice b is incorrect. This American ideal is cited in the last paragraph. Choice c is incorrect. This American ideal is cited in paragraph 3. 44. Choice a is correct. People not having the same r ights as others means roughly the same thing as the denial of equal treatment. Choice b is incorrect. This means the opposite of the quotation in question. Choice c is incorrect. In this sentence, Johnson is explaining that there were reasons for what happened rather than restating the problem of people being treated differently. Choice d is incorrect. Johnson is afrming that Americans of all races have contributed to their country. 45. Choice c is correct. This is the best answer b ecause one of the main points of the remarks is to explain that the Civil Rights Act will bring the United States closer to achieving its goals and values. Choice a is incorrect. Johnson does not mention the Civil War in the passage. Choice b is incorrect. The Grand Canyon is one of America's natural wonders, unrelated to America's unending search for justice domestically. Choice d is incorrect. Johnson alludes to the Vietnam War in the text and uses it as an example of how American values are spanning the globe, but this is a small detail in the passage rather than a main idea. As well, Vietnam is outside of \"our own borders.\" 46. Choice b is correct. Johnson talks about the v alues that the forefathers focused on when forming the nation in this paragraph. Choice a is incorrect. This is a detail of the pas-sage, but not the main theme. C hoice c is incorrect. This idea is not stated in the paragraph, and it also runs counter to the entire point of the speech. Choice d is incorrect. There is no evidence to support this conclusion in the remarks. 47. Choice a is correct. Johnson expresses many t imes and in a variety of ways that equality is one of the cornerstones of American values. Choice b is incorrect. Johnson talks about how he believes America is a great country, but this is not the main idea of his remarks. Choice c is incorrect. Johnson's remarks are about America's ideal of ensuring equality, yet to be achieved. Choice d is incorrect. Johnson makes no value judgment about himself. 488488 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST 48. Choice d is correct. This is Johnson's brief e xplanation of how inequality happened, rather than an explanation of how the law aligns with American values. Choice a is incorrect. Johnson uses history and the vision of the forefathers to illustrate that freedom is a core American value and that free- dom includes equality. C hoice b is incorrect. Johnson says that because American values are shaping foreign struggles, the United States must continue to make sure that it upholds its own values. Choice c is incorrect. Johnson uses this sentence to say that all kinds of people, regardless of race, have fought for the country.

While both positions are well reasoned, organized and sup-ported with authoritative quotes and examples, the unimp eachable evidence against nuclear energy, upon reflection, is greater. Both sides agree that fossil fuels are not healthy for the environment and people. Opponents and propo- nents also agree that radioactivity is deadly, although the proponents whitewash this fact by only describing the need to keep radioactivity contained by stating in paragraph 4 that \"Radioactive waste is contained deep underground behind steel-reinforced, 1.2 meter thick concrete walls.\" On the other hand, the second essay speaks more plainly, \"First, nuclear radioactivity is deadly and must be contained for thousands of years.\" In fact, the second essay uses evidence found in the rst essay to support its premise. The pro-nuclear position also avoids the topics of me ltdown and the construction of atomic weapons from radioactive materials used in nuclear power plants. To not address and gloss over these topics makes the rst essay seem more like an advertisement for the nuclear industry rather than an objective assessment of well-known and troubling facts. In paragraph 7, the writer points out what we all know, that \"Widespread radioac- tive contamination and death caused by the nuclear ac cidents at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fuku- shima are cautionary lessons.\" and that \"it's undeniable that nuclear meltdown causes widespread contamina- tion of the air, water and land with deadly radioactiv-ity. It is also veriable that nuclear accidents have caus ed environmental catastrophes that continue to this day.\" For me, nothing more needs to be said about the absolute truth about the real danger of nuclear energy, but the author of the second essay indeed provides up-to-date evidence from Reuters regarding international fears of Iran developing atomic weaponry under the guise of building nuclear power plants. In the end, the opponent position offers a safe and sane s olution to fossil fuels and nuclear power. About this essay: This essay has earned the maximum number of p oints in each trait for a total of 6 points. Trait 1: Creation of Arguments and Use of Evidence This response evaluates the arguments in the source t ext, develops an effective position supported by the text, and fullls the criteria to earn 2 points for Trait 1. This response establishes its stance in the rst se ntence (I conclude that the case against nuclear energy is more compelling than the case for nuclear energy) and provides a summary of support for that stance (While both essays are well reasoned, organized and supported with authoritative quotes and examples, the unimpeachable evidence against nuclear energy, upon reflection, is greater). It also weighs the validity of evidence (although the proponents whitewash this fact by only describing the need to keep radioactivity contained) and critiques omissions (To not address and gloss over these topics makes the rst essay seem more like an advertisement for the nuclear industry rather than an objective assess- ment of well-known and troubling facts). Trait 2: Development of Ideas and Organizational S tructure This response is well developed and fullls the criteria t o earn 2 points for Trait 2. It is well organized, from the writer's clear point of view in the rst paragraph to the step-by-step comparison of the pros and cons presented in the source material. The writer's vocabulary and sentence structures ar e sophisticated, and the tone shows an urgency of purpose. 492492 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST Trait 3: Clarity and Command of Standard English Conventions This response fullls the criteria for draft writing and ear ns 2 points for Trait 3. Besides employing sophisti- cated sentence structure (Both sides agree that fossil fue ls are not healthy for the environment and people. Opponents and proponents also agree that radioactivity is deadly, although the proponents whitewash this fact by only describing the need to keep radioactivity con- tained by stating in paragraph 4 that. . . .) this response uses clear transitions in its compare and contrast construction (On the other hand, the second essay speaks more plainly. . . .) In addition, the writer adheres to proper gram- mar and usage. Sample Score 4 Essay The supporters of nuclear energy best show how it is s uperior to other forms of energy. We have only begun to use nuclear energy, and while the opposing position only describes the danger of radioactivity, it is true from another point of view that scientists learn more every- day about how to contain these types of materials. We ha ve only just begun to fulll the promise of nuclear energy. In the rst paragraph the author states that \"The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) promotes the devel- opment of safe, domestic nuclear power...\" The United S tates government and its agencies are powerful and highly-regarded authorities, so if the DOE says that nuclear energy is the way to go, I don't have an argu-ment with that. The opposing position to nuclear power states t hat radioactivity is dangerous, that containing the danger is difcult and that evil-doers can create atomic bombs from enriched uranium are scare tactics. First of all, the \"Nuclear Regulatory Commission ensures that each and every nuclear reactor maintains strict safety standards.\" Nuclear accidents are a thing of the past as scientists work hard to be able to control nuclear power plants. Not to mention that so far, there no one has built a bomb from plutonium stolen used in a nuclear po wer plant. All in all, a strong case against nuclear energy was no t made and the case for nuclear energy continues to build on the authority of science. About this essay: This essay earned 1 point each for Trait 1 and Trait 2 and 2 p oints for Trait 3. Trait 1: Creation of Arguments and Use of Evidence This response makes an argument, supports it with so me evidence from the source text, and offers a par - tial analysis of the opposing argument, earning it 1 p oint for Trait 1. The writer makes an issue-based statement of p osition in the rst sentence: The supporters of nuclear energy best show how it is superior to other forms of energy. The essay goes on to cite textual evidence in the second paragraph for support (The U.S. Depart- ment of Energy (DOE) promotes the development of saf e, domestic nuclear power. . . .) but then relies on the fallacy of authority to validate this position (The United States government and its agencies are powerful and highly-regarded authorities, so if the DOE says that nuclear energy is the way to go, I don't have an argu- ment with that). The summary of opposing arguments in para- graph 4 is supercial and simplistic: The opposing position to nuclear power states that radioactivity is dangerous, that containing the danger is difcult and that evil-doers can create atomic bombs from enriched uranium are scare tactics. Trait 2: Development of Ideas and Organizational S tructure The response's general conclusion has no support, and in general it displays only adequate skill of word choice, although the tone is audience appropriate. The response is fairly organized, but the ideas rely on authority, earning this response 1 point for Trait 2. 493493 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST The writer establishes a stance in the beginning of the response and roughly organizes material in a compare-and-contrast structure loosely based on speculation not found in the source text: We have only begun to use nuclear energy, and while the opposing position only describes the danger of radioactivity, it is true from another point of view that scientists learn more everyday about how to contain these types of materials. Trait 3: Clarity and Command of Standard English C onventions Because the response fullls level criteria for draft w riting on demand, it earns the full 2 points for Trait 3. Overall, this response displays proper sentence st ructure and appropriate use of transitional words: We have only begun to use nuclear energy, and while the opposing position only describes the danger of radio- activity, it is true from another point of view that scien-tists learn more everyday about how to contain these t ypes of materials. In general, the response demonstrates proper use of conventions, including subject-verb agree- ment, pronoun, and punctuation use. Sample Score 3 Essay The benets of nuclear energy are by far more benecial t o supply America's need for power than fossil, solar or any other kind of alternative energy source. As the introduction states, \"it has become clear that we need to ease our dependence on foreign countries that supply us with oil and develop energy at home.\" That's common sense and pretty much proves the point. The supporters show how nuclear energy is safe and efcient and gives statistics about how much waste comes from nuclear energy and how much comes from fossil fuels. The opposers suppose nuclear power plants will have meltdowns and contaminate the environ- ment. They also worries about irresponsible people making at om bombs. After reading both sides though I was convinced that compared to fossil fuels such as gas, coal, and oil nuclear energy is the most efcient way to make elec- tricity, Nuclear energy leaves less waste too. In conclusion, I agree with the rst opinion and ho pe disasters like Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukishima are a thing of the past. About this essay: This essay earned 1 point each for Trait 1, Trait 2, and T rait 3. Trait 1: Creation of Arguments and Use of Evidence This draft fullls the criteria for Trait 1 by generating an argument in the opening sentence that demon- strates a connection to the prompt: The benets of nuclear energy are by far more benecial to supply America's need for power than fossil, solar or any other kind of alternative energy source. The argument is then supported by source text ( it has become clear that we need to ease our depen- dence on foreign countries that supply us with oil and de velop energy at home), but the writer's analysis of the source text is simplistic and limited: That's com- mon sense and pretty much proves the point. Trait 2: Development of Ideas and Organizational S tructure Overall, the writer demonstrates awareness of audi- ence and purpose, earning this response 1 point for T rait 2. The writer simply summarizes the pro and con argume nts without quotation (The supporters show how nuclear energy is safe and efcient and gives statis- tics about how much waste comes from nuclear energy and how much comes from fossil fuels. The opposers suppose nuclear power plants will have meltdowns and contaminate the environment. They also worries about irresponsible people making atom bombs), but demon- strates a logical flow of ideas. 494494 - - REASONING THROUGH LANGUAGE ARTS (RLA) PRACTICE TEST The conclusion in favor of the supporting posi- tion is abrupt and unsupported, although the writer's nal clause shows attention to the source material and genuine consideration of both sides of the issue: In conclusion, I agree with the rst opinion and hope disasters like Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fuku- shima are a thing of the past. Word choice is adequate throughout, and althoug h ideas progress and develop somewhat, thoughts are not fully executed to a supported conclusion. Trait 3: Clarity and Command of Standard English C onventions This sample response is comprehensible and main- tains an acceptable level of appropriateness to earn it 1 p oint for Trait 3. The writer's short response lacks a variety of se ntence structures, and although most sentences are grammatically correct, there are usage and punctua-tion errors in the text. For example: The supporters show how nuclear energy is safe and efcient and gives statistics and They also worries about. . . . Additionally, source text is cited without quota- tion marks: A fter reading both essays though I was con- vinced that [\"]compared to fossil fuels such as gas, coal and oil, nuclear energy is the most efcient way to make electricity,[\"] Nuclear energy leaves less waste too. Sample Score 0 Essay The best way to think if solar energy is better then n uclear energy or if fossil fuels is better then wind power are to look at the facts not just listen to opinions of peo-ple who don't know what they're talking about or are no t scientists which know about energy in the broadest sense of the term... These facts. Most folks got no idea that nuclear power is so much stronger than fossil fuel power because just a tiny bit of uranium can make more energy than barrels of oil or tons of coal. You can take that to the bank. If you want to know the dangers about nuclear e nergy, read the second part of the story. People can make bombs from uranium and thereve been lots of accidents too. Some say we should throw the dice with nuclear power though because we have to be indepen- dent. Why we don't want to blow up the Earth. But we nee d electricity and gas to live our everyday lives. That's why the United States needs to grab the bull by the horn and get scientists to make nuclear energy. Better for future generations.

These relationships can be categorized further based on the effect of the relationship on the second organism. The table shows the three types of symbiotic relation- ships and their effects on each organism. SYMBi OTic Re LATiOn SHiP SP ecieS 1 SPecieS 2 Mutualism + + Commensalism + 0 - harmed KeY + benefits Parasitism + - 0 no effect Veterinary clinics often treat pets with illnesses resulting from parasitism. Three common parasites diagnosed in dogs are the dog flea, the deer tick, and Cheyletiella mites. Dog fleas and deer ticks both feed on the host animal's (dog's) blood and can transmit dis- eases to the host animal through their bites. Dog fleas lay their eggs on the host animal's body and can survive on the host animal or on surfaces the animal comes in contact with, such as bed- ding. Deer ticks lay their eggs on the ground and attach to the host animal only while feeding. Cheyletiella m ites live within and feed on the keratin layer of the host animal's skin. Cheyleti- ella m ites reproduce on the host animal and can survive away from the host animal only for short periods of time. extracts water and nutrients from the tree's 1.

Consumers in an ecosystem are classified by feeding level. Primary consumers feed on producers. Secondary consumers feed on primary consumers, and tertiary consumers feed on secondary con- sumers. Consumers in a food web are classified according to their highest feeding level. A consumer's population size is determined largely by the complex relationships that exist w ithin the ecosystem's food web. Population size is most obviously limited by the population size of the consumer's food source(s). An increase or decrease in a food source population often leads to a similar change in the consumer population. The availability of a food source may be limited by other consumer populations competing for the same food source. An increase in a competitor population may lead to a decreased availability of the shared food source. Population size is also limited by the population size of the consumer's predator(s). Predation by higher-level consumers keeps the lower consumer population from growing out of control and upsetting the ecosystem's balance. The food web for a woodland ecosystem bordering an area of farmland is shown below. Foxes Owls Birds Mice GrasshoppersRabbits Carrots Grasses Grains (Not drawn to According to the passage, rabbits are consid- ered primary consumers because they a. feed on grasses and carrots b. are consumed by foxes only c. compete with grasshoppers only d. are the only consumer of carrots 14. Which three organisms in the food web obtain e nergy directly or indirectly from grasshoppers? a. owls, birds, and mice b. owls, birds, and grains c. foxes, rabbits, and mice d. foxes, owls, and birds 15. A bacterial disease has destroyed most of the far m's carrot crop for the past two seasons. As a result, the rabbit population has been forced to rely more heavily on grasses for a food source.

Respiration is the cellular process used by living things to convert the chemical energy in food to a form that can be used by cells. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the high-energy molecule that all living things use to fuel cellular processes. During respiration, a molecule of glucose is converted to mole-cules of ATP to be used by the cell. Depending on the conditions, respira- tion occurs by two different pathways: aero-bic and anaerobic. When a cell has a sufficient supply of oxygen, aerobic respira-tion occurs. This pathway uses oxygen as a reactant, along with glucose, to produce 36 to 38 molecules of ATP from each molecule of glucose. Aerobic respiration is the pre-ferred pathway in most cells. The general equation for aerobic respiration is shown below. C 6H12O6 + 6O2 q energy + 6CO2 + 6H2O When sufficient oxygen is not avail- able, anaerobic respiration occurs. This pathway produces two molecules of ATP from each molecule of glucose. Anaerobic respiration sometimes occurs in human muscle cells. During exercise, muscle cells use energy faster than the oxygen supply can be replenished, causing the cells to switch temporarily to anaerobic respiration. 20. A student draws the model below to represent the process of aerobic respiration. + + + energy Which change would improve the accuracy of the student's model? a. connecting all of the circles to each other to show bonds b. moving the energy symbol to the left side of the equation c. adding ve triangles to balance the right side of the equation d. making the rectangles smaller to show relative molecular sizes 21. The energy produced by respiration is in what form? a. ATP b. oxygen c. glucose d. carbon dioxide 22. Explain the benet of having two pathways for respiration in the human body.

The symbiotic relationship exhibited by mistle- toe and spruce trees is parasitism. The mistle- toe receives a benet in the form of a source of n utrients and water. The spruce tree is harmed because it loses nutrients and water, which can eventually lead to the death of the tree. The table indicates that parasitism is occurring when one organism benets (mistletoe) and the other organism is harmed (spruce tree). The symbiotic relationship exhibited by E. coli and humans is mutualism. The E. coli receive a benet in the form of nutrients and a habitat in which to live. The human also receives a benet because the E. coli produce vitamin K, which is then used within the human body. The table indicates that mutualism is occurring when both organisms benet. Commensalism is not demonstrated in either of these relationships. The table indicates that commensalism occurs when one organism ben- ets but the other organism is neither helped no r harmed. 2. Choice c is correct. The fleas and ticks obtain n utrients from the host animal's blood, and the mites obtain nutrients from the host animal's skin. Choice a is incorrect. Although the fleas and mites may live on the host animal's body, the ticks do not. Choice b is incorrect. Parasites can transmit diseases to the host animal, but this does not provide a benet to the parasite. Choice d is incorrect. Although the fleas and mites reproduce on the host animal's body, the ticks do not. 3. Choice b is correct. The passage states that Che yletiella mites live within the outermost layer of the dog's skin and have difculty sur - viving away from the host animal's body. A t echnician wearing gloves during examination of the dog and disposing of them afterward helps to prevent mites that may be on the tech-nician's hands from being transmitted to other animals in the c linic. Choice a is incorrect. Vaccines can be adminis-tered to uninfected individuals to prevent the t ransmission of diseases caused by viruses. Mites are arthropods that live on the host ani-mal's body and cannot be eliminated with a v accine. Choice c is incorrect. Avoiding contact with open wounds would help prevent the transmission of blood-borne pathogens, such as those transmitted by fleas and ticks. Choice d is incorrect. Sterilizing the exam room after, not before, examination of the infected dog could help prevent the transmission of mites to other animals in the clinic. 516516 - - SCIENCE PRACTICE TEST 4. In order for an eclipse to occur, the sun, earth, and moon must be aligned in a particular way. When the ear th is positioned between the sun and the moon, the earth will prevent sunlight from reaching the moon. This is a lunar eclipse. When the moon is positioned between the sun and the earth, the moon will prevent sunlight from reaching a portion of the earth. This is a solar eclipse. Penumbra Umbra Moon Earth Sun X On the diag ram, the moon has reached the position in its orbit that is in Earth's shadow, resulting in a lunar eclipse. From its current position on the diagram, the moon would need to travel 180\u00b0 (or halfway) around its orbit to produce a solar eclipse. In this new position, the moon would cast a shadow on the earth. 5. In a cladogram, the group that exhibits the few-est characteristics is listed on the bottom left b ranch and the group exhibiting the most char - acteristics is listed on the top right branch. Mosses Ferns Conifers Flowering Plants Flowers Seeds Vascular Tissue Ancestral Plant Species Mosses are placed on the rst (lower left) branch because they exhibited none of the characteris - tics listed in the table. Ferns contain vascular tis - sue, so they are listed on the second branch. Co nfers are the third branch because they con - tain vascular tissue and produce seeds. Flowering p lants exhibit all three characteristics listed in the table, so they are the fourth (highest) branch. 517517 - - SCIENCE PRACTICE TEST 6. Choice a is correct. Describing the pattern in the data al lows for the relationship between water temperature and oxygen solubility to be identied. As you look down the table, water temperature increases and maximum oxygen solubility decreases. This shows that water tem- perature and dissolved oxygen concentration ha ve an inverse relationship, with highest dis- solved oxygen concentrations occurring at the lo west temperatures. Choice b is incorrect. According to the table, bodies of water with an average temperature of 40\u00b0C have a maximum oxygen solubility of 6.4 mg/L, and bodies of water with an average t emperature of 100\u00b0C contain no dissolved oxygen. Temperatures between these two should support oxygen concentrations between 6.4 and 0 mg/L. Choice c is incorrect. Although an increase from 0 to 10\u00b0C results in a 3 mg/L increase in oxygen solubility, oxygen solubility does not continue to increase by the same increment with each additional 10\u00b0C increase in temperature. Choice d is incorrect. Although many variables can affect oxygen solubility, the table focuses only on the relationship between oxygen solubility and water temperature. 7. Choice c is correct. Grasses release oxygen into the e nvironment as a byproduct of photosynthesis. Using this reasoning, it can be predicted that an increase in freshwater grasses will increase the dissolved oxygen concentration. Based on the data in the table, an increase to 8.5 mg/L brings the dissolved oxygen concentration closer to the maximum oxygen solubility for a body of water with an average temperature of 21\u00b0C. Choice a is incorrect. Aquatic plants like freshwater grasses release oxygen into the environment. A dissolved oxygen concentration of 6.3 mg/L would result from an event that decreases the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. Choice b is incorrect. A dissolved oxygen concentration of 7.2 mg/L would indicate no change in the ecosystem. A change in the freshwater grass population would alter the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water. Choice d is incorrect. A doubling of the freshwater grass population would cause an increase in dissolved oxygen concentration but not a doubling. According to the table, a dissolved oxygen concentration of 14.4 mg/L far exceeds the maximum oxygen solubility for a body of water with an average temperature of 21\u00b0C. 518518 - - SCIENCE PRACTICE TEST 8. Choice c is correct. Range can be determined b y calculating the difference between the lowest and highest values in a data set. The table shows that the temperature of a yellow star is between 5,000 K and 6,000 K. This is a range of 1,000 K, which is the smallest (or narrowest) range listed in the table. Choice a is incorrect. White stars have a maximum temperature of 11,000 K. The minimum temperature of blue-white stars is 11,000 K. Choice b is incorrect. Red stars have a maximum temperature of 3,500 K. A star with a temperature of 3,700 K would be within the range of an orange star. Choice d is incorrect. The table does not provide information about the highest surface temperature recorded for a star. The minimum temperature of a blue star is shown to be 25,000 K. This indicates that blue stars can have temperatures higher than 25,000 K. 9. Choice b is correct. In the context of this ocean wa ve diagram, a wavelength is the horizontal distance between two crests (A and B). Using the given denition of wave period, it can be determined that the wave period is the amount of time required to travel one wavelength. Choice a is incorrect. A shoreline is not shown or mentioned in the diagram. Choice c is incorrect. Wave period relates to the horizontal movement of a wave, while calm sea level is a reference point used to measure the vertical movement of a wave. Choice d is incorrect. In the diagram, points A and B used to measure wave period are both crests. The time required to travel from crest to trough would be half of a wave period. 10. Choice b is correct. A h urricane and tornado occurring in the same year would be considered a compound event because two events are occurring together. The probability of a com- pound event can be determined by multiplying the p robabilities of each event occurring indi- vidually. The probability of a hurricane (0.39) m ultiplied by the probability of a tornado (0.96) provides a compound probability of 0.3744. C hoice a is incorrect. A probability of 0 indicates that there is no chance of an event occurring. Since there is a possibility of a hurricane and a possibility of a tornado occurring individually, there is also a possibility of both events occurring in the same year. Choice c is incorrect. This is the probability of a tornado alone occurring during any given year. The probability of both a tornado and a hurri- cane occurring in the same year would be much lo wer because the probability of a hurricane is much lower (0.39) than the probability of a tor - nado (0.96). C hoice d is incorrect. A probability greater than 1 indicates that an event is guaranteed to occur. Since the individual probabilities of a hurricane or tornado occurring are both less than 1, the probability of both events occurring in the same year would also be less than 1. 519519 - - SCIENCE PRACTICE TEST 11.

When the pressure built up at a plate boundary becomes too great, energy is released in the form of an earthquake. Earthquakes can be expected to occur most fre- quently along plate boundaries. Since the west c oast of the continental United States lies on a plate boundary, the probability of an earth-quake occurring in this region can be predicted t o be much higher than the probability for the United States as a whole, most of which does not lie on plate boundaries. The occurrence of hurricanes, floods, and tor - nadoes is not specically tied to the activity of t ectonic plates. An increase in the probability of any of these natural hazards along a plate boundary as compared to the United States as a whole is not a reasonable prediction. 12. Choice d is correct. The runner takes in c hemical energy in the form of carbohydrates. This chemical energy is transformed into kinetic energy as the runner's muscles contract and relax, causing the runner to move. Runners carb load to ensure that their bodies have enough chemical energy to be transformed into the kinetic energy required to run a marathon. Choice a is incorrect. The runner does take in chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates. Though some of this chemical energy is transformed into thermal energy in the form of body heat, the purpose of carb loading is to improve muscle performance, not increase body heat. Choice b is incorrect. The purpose of carb load- ing is to increase the amount of energy available f or transformation into kinetic energy (motion). Carb loading increases the availabil-ity of chemical energy, though, not thermal e nergy. Carbohydrates contain energy stored in their chemical bonds, not as heat. Choice c is incorrect. The goal of carb loading is to improve muscle performance (motion), not increase body heat. Muscle performance is improved by increasing the chemical energy available for transformation into kinetic energy. 520520 - - SCIENCE PRACTICE TEST 13. Choice a is correct. A p rimary-level consumer 15. Answers will vary. feeds on producers. Producers, such as plants, mak e their own food using energy from sun- light. Rabbits feed on two producers, carrots and g rasses, making rabbits a primary-level consumer. Choice b is incorrect. An organism's feeding level is determined by how it obtains its food, not by the organisms that it provides food for. Though the rabbits in the food web are consumed by foxes, this does not determine the rabbits' feeding level. Choice c is incorrect. Competition with other organisms does not affect how an organism's feeding level is classied. Choice d is incorrect. The presence of other organisms that consume the same food source does not affect how an organism's feeding level is classied. 14. Choice d is correct. A n organism provides energy to all organisms above it in the food web. In this food web, the grasshoppers provide energy to the birds, owls, and foxes. The birds and owls obtain energy directly when they consume the grasshoppers. The foxes obtain energy indirectly when they consume birds that previously consumed grasshoppers. Choice a is incorrect. Although owls and birds obtain energy from grasshoppers, mice do not obtain energy from grasshoppers. Choice b is incorrect. Grains provide energy to grasshoppers but do not obtain energy from grasshoppers. Choice c is incorrect. Rabbits and mice do not obtain energy from grasshoppers either directly or indirectly. The highest number of points you can earn on this sho rt-response essay is 3. A 3-point essay contains: n a clear and well-developed explanation of how a change in one population effects change in other populations within the food web n well-developed examples from the given food web describing the likely effects of change in the rabbit population on other specic populations n complete support from the passage Sample 3-point response: The interrelatedness of populations in the food web mak es it likely that all populations will be affected in some way by the shift in the rabbits' feeding habits. The rabbits' increased reliance on grasses will cause a dom-ino effect on the availability of food for all primary con- sumers. Since grasshoppers directly compete with r abbits for grasses, the availability of grasses for grass- hoppers may be limited. As a result, grasshoppers would lik ely increase their dependence on grains, decreasing the availability of this food source for birds and mice. The overall increase in competition among primary consumers may cause some decreases in population sizes, which would also limit the population sizes of higher-level consumers. A 2-point essay contains: n an adequate or partially articulated explanation of how a change in one population effects change in other populations within the food web n partial examples from the given food web describing the likely effects of change in the rab- bit population on other specic populations n partial support from the passage 521521 - - __ __ __ __ SCIENCE PRACTICE TEST Sample 2-point response: When the rabbits start eating more grasses, the grass-hoppers will have less food because they eat grasses too. This means that the grasshopper population might get smaller, so the owls and birds would have less food. Foxes eat birds, so they would have less food too. A 1-point essay contains: n a minimal or implied explanation of how a change in one population effects change in other populations within the food web n one or incomplete examples from the given food web describing the likely effects of change in the rabbit population on other specic populations n minimal or implied support from the passage Sample 1-point response: The rabbits will eat more grass. Grasshoppers will not ha ve as much grass to eat. Some grasshoppers will die because they don't have enough food. A 0-point essay contains: n no explanation of how a change in one popula- tion effects change in other populations within the f ood web n no examples from the given food web describing the likely effects of change in the rabbit popula-tion on other specic populations n no support from the passage 16. Blank 1: The appropriate value to complete this stat ement is 36.5. The formula for converting temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius is given as (\u00b0F - 32) \u00d7 95 = \u00b0C. Replacing the lower variable \u00b0F with 97.7 and solving gives (97.7 - 32) \u00d7 95 = 36.5. Blank 2: The appropriate value to complete this statement is 37.5. The formula for converting temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius is given as (\u00b0F - 32) \u00d7 5 = \u00b0C. Replacing the lower variable9 \u00b0F with 99.5 and solving gives (99.5 - 32) \u00d7 95 = 37.5. 17. Choice d is correct. A s indicated in the diagram, the daughter cells produced during meiosis each have half the total number of chromosomes as the parent cell does. These daughter cells, called gametes, are used for reproduction. When reproduction occurs, two gametes (egg and sperm) unite to create a cell with a full set of chromosomes. Choice a is incorrect. To allow an organism to grow larger, the daughter cells produced must be identical to the parent cell. Cells used for growth are produced by the process of mitosis. Choice b is incorrect. To allow an organism to repair tissues, the daughter cells produced must be identical to the parent cell. The cells used for tissue repair are produced by the process of mitosis. Choice c is incorrect. Cell differentiation occurs when a single, non-specialized cell is converted to a specialized cell type, like a blood cell or skin cell. No daughter cells are produced during the differentiation process. 522522 - - __________________ SCIENCE PRACTICE TEST 18. Choice b is correct. The average speed can be d etermined by adding the individual vehicle speeds and dividing by the total number of vehicles. This is calculated as 61 + 48 + 61 + 51 + 59 5 = 56 mph. Choice a is incorrect. This is the speed limit for the highway, not the average speed of the ve vehicles listed. Choice c is incorrect. This is the median speed of the ve vehicles, not the average (mean) speed. Choice d is incorrect. This is the mode for the speed of the ve vehicles, not the average (mean) speed. 19. Choice d is correct. Each new cell created by me iosis must contain one chromosome from each of the seven chromosome pairs. As illustrated in the diagram, these single chromosomes can be combined in multiple ways. To determine the total number of unique chromosome combinations, the number of chromosomes in each set (pair) must be multiplied. Seven sets of two chromosomes each means that seven 2's must be multiplied (2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 128) to determine the total number of unique chromosome com- binations possible. C hoice a is incorrect. There are seven total chromosomes in a cell produced by meiosis, but the specic chromosome present from each chromosome pair can vary. Choice b is incorrect. Two chromosomes in each of seven pairs provides a total of 14 chro- mosomes, but the specic chromosome present fr om each pair can vary. Choice c is incorrect. Multiplying 7 \u00d7 7 does not provide the total number of chromosome combinations possible. To determine this, the number of chromosomes in each pair must be multiplied by the number of chromosomes in each other pair. 20. Choice c is correct. The products of respiration ar e six molecules of carbon dioxide, six molecules of water, and energy. On the right side of the model, six rectangles are present but only one triangle. To accurately represent a bal- anced equation, all molecules must be repre- sented in the model. C hoice a is incorrect. The circles represent the six molecules of the reactant oxygen. Connecting the circles would not improve the model's accuracy because separate molecules are not bound to each other. Choice b is incorrect. Energy is a product of the respiration reaction and is therefore appropri- ately placed on the right side of the equation. M oving the energy symbol to the left side of the equation would indicate that energy is a reactant. Choice d is incorrect. Reducing the size of the rectangles is not the most needed change, since the other molecules are not represented to scale. 21. Choice a is correct. The purpose of respiration is t o convert energy into a form that is useable by cells. Respiration produces ATP , a high-energy molecule, which the cell can use to carry out cellular functions. Choice b is incorrect. Oxygen is a reactant\u2014not a product\u2014of aerobic respiration and does not provide energy for the cell. Choice c is incorrect. Respiration uses the glucose in food to produce ATP . Respiration does not produce glucose. Choice d is incorrect. Although respiration does produce carbon dioxide, this molecule does not provide energy for the cell. 523523 - - SCIENCE PRACTICE TEST 22.

A 3-point essay contains: n a clear and well-developed explanation of the benets of the aerobic respiration pathway in the human body n a clear and well-developed explanation of the benets of the anaerobic respiration pathway in the human body n complete support from the passage Sample 3-point response: The human body may use two different pathways to car ry out respiration. The presence of two different pathways is valuable because it allows a cell to choose the pathway that best meets its current energy needs. Aerobic respiration produces the greatest amount of ATP per glucose molecule. Under normal conditions with adequate oxygen, this pathway provides the great- est possible amount of energy to the cell. Anaerobic res-piration produces much less ATP per glucose molecule b ut does not require oxygen. Under strenuous condi- tions when the cell demands energy faster than the oxy-gen supply can be replenished, this pathway provides e nough energy to maintain cell functions. The ability to switch between aerobic and anaerobic pathways allows the human body to function properly under varying conditions. A 2-point essay contains: n an adequate or partially articulated explanation of the benets of the aerobic respiration pathway in the human body n an adequate or partially articulated explanation of the benets of the anaerobic respiration path- way in the human body n partial support from the passage Aerobic respiration produces the most ATP, but requires o xygen. Anaerobic respiration produces much less ATP, but does not require oxygen. Having two pathways is important because sometimes oxygen is available, and sometimes it is not. A 1-point essay contains: n a minimal or implied explanation of the benets of the aerobic respiration pathway in the human body n a minimal or implied explanation of the benets of the anaerobic respiration pathway in the human body n minimal or implied support from the passage Sample 1-point response: Cells use aerobic respiration most of the time. Muscle c ells use anaerobic respiration when a person is exercis- ing. Both types of respiration are important. A 0-point essay contains: n no explanation of the benets of the aerobic res- piration pathway in the human body n no explanation of the benets of the anaerobic respiration pathway in the human body n no support from the passage 23. Choice c is correct. A s shown in the model, a solid has a xed volume and shape. A liquid has a xed volume but assumes the shape of the container. A gas assumes the volume and shape of the container. A liquid has one property in common with solids and one property in common with gases. Choice a is incorrect. In this summary, the properties of a liquid are reversed. Liquids have a xed volume and assume the shape of the container. Choice b is incorrect. Liquids have a xed volume, as solids do, but not a xed shape. Choice d is incorrect. Liquids assume the shape of the container, as gases do, but not the volume. 524524 - - SCIENCE PRACTICE TEST 24. Choice a is correct. The density of a substance d escribes how tightly packed the substance's molecules are. As shown in the model, a substance's molecules are most spread out when in the gas state. This means that a substance's density is lowest when in the gas state. The substance's density increases when going from gas to liquid state because the molecules become more tightly packed. Choice b is incorrect. A substance's molecules become more spread out when changing from solid to gas state. This causes the substance's density to decrease. Choice c is incorrect. A substance's molecules become more spread out when changing from liquid to gas state. This causes the substance's density to decrease. Choice d is incorrect. A substance's molecules may become slightly more spread out, or less dense, when changing from solid to liquid state. However, the density of a substance does not change much during this state change. 25. Choice d is correct. Based on the data in the tab le, this statement can be identied as a fact. The energy content of ethanol is 27.3 kJ/g, about 16 kJ/g less than the energy content of petroleum (43.6 kJ/g). Choice a is incorrect. This statement is speculation based on data from the table. According to the table, hydrogen has the greatest energy content and releases no carbon dioxide. Although this data supports the speculation that cars may be fueled by hydrogen cells in the future, this statement is no guarantee. Choice b is incorrect. This statement is a judgment based on data from the table. According to the table, petroleum has a higher energy content than ethanol. Although this data can be used to support the judgment that petroleum is the better fuel source, this statement is an opinion rather than a fact. Choice c is incorrect. This statement is speculation based on data from the table. Although the data in the table suggests that natural gas is a relatively efcient and clean fuel source, the statement is speculation because no information is provided about the cost of natural gas. 525525 - - SCIENCE PRACTICE TEST 26. Choice c is correct. The passage identies nat ural gas, petroleum, and coal as fossil fuels, because each is derived from the fossil remains of organisms. The energy content of each fossil fuel can be approximated to 50 kJ/g, 45 kJ/g, and 40 kJ/g, respectively. This provides an estimated average energy content of 45 kJ/g. Choice a is incorrect. This would be an appropriate estimate for the energy content of coal, not for the energy content of all three fossil fuels. Choice b is incorrect. This would be an appropriate estimate for the energy content of petroleum and coal, but natural gas is also a fossil fuel. Choice d is incorrect. This would be an appropriate estimate for the energy content of natural gas, not for the energy content of all three fossil fuels. 27. Choice a is correct. Burning a candle is an e xothermic process because thermal energy, or heat, is released as a result of the process. Choice b is incorrect. Melting a snow bank is an endothermic process because the input of heat is required to melt the snow. This means that thermal energy is absorbed during the process, not released. Choice c is incorrect. Baking a loaf of bread is an endothermic process because the input of heat is required to convert the ingredients to bread. This means that thermal energy is absorbed during the process, not released. Choice d is incorrect. Photosynthesis is an endothermic process because the input of energy (sunlight) is required for plants to make sugar. This means that energy is absorbed during the process, not released. 28. Choice a is correct. T he car has a constant positive acceleration when the car's velocity is increasing at a steady, or constant, rate. Between 0 and 20 seconds, the graph moves upward in a straight diagonal line, indicating that the velocity is increasing at a constant rate. Choice b is incorrect. Between 20 and 40 seconds, the car is maintaining a constant velocity of 20 m/s. Since the velocity is constant within this time period, the car is not accelerating (has an acceleration of 0 m/s 2). Choice c is incorrect. Between 40 and 50 seconds, the car's velocity is decreasing at a constant rate. This indicates a constant negative acceleration. Choice d is incorrect. Between 50 and 90 seconds, the car's velocity is increasing, but not at a constant rate. The graph moves upward in a curved line within this time period, indicating that the velocity is increasing at a variable rate. 29. Choice b is correct. The mechanical advantage o f a pulley system does not change with the load. Mechanical advantage is calculated as load divided by input force. In the data table, dividing each load by its corresponding input force produces a mechanical advantage of three. Choice a is incorrect. As the load size increases, the input force required to lift the load increases at a constant rate. The mechanical advantage of the pulley system does not change. Choice c is incorrect. A pulley system multiplies the input force, not the mechanical advantage, applied to a load. Choice d is incorrect. No decrease in mechanical advantage occurs with an increase in load. The mechanical advantage of a pulley system is constant regardless of the size of the load. 526526 - - SCIENCE PRACTICE TEST 30. Choice d is correct. A ccording to the table, an input force of 50 N can lift a 150-N load. If a 1-N load has a mass of 10 grams, the mass of a load can be determined by multiplying the force of the load by 10. A 150-N load therefore has a mass of 1,500 grams. Choice a is incorrect. This value is the result of dividing the force of the load (150 N) by 10. The mass of the load is determined by multiplying, not dividing, the force of the load by 10. Choice b is incorrect. This is the value of the input force, not the mass of the load. Choice c is incorrect. This is the value of the force of the load in Newtons, not the mass of the load in grams. 31. Choice b is correct. Kale is a leafy crop species. A ccording to the diagram, wild mustard plants were selected for leaves to produce kale. This means that wild mustard plants that had large leaves were specically bred together to increase leaf size. This selective breeding over multiple generations led to a new species (kale) characterized by large leaves. Choice a is incorrect. Plants with desired characteristics (large leaves for kale) must be bred together to produce offspring plants with those characteristics. Removing stems and flowers from existing mustard plants will not increase leaf size in subsequent generations. Choice c is incorrect. Breeding small-leafed plants and large-leafed plants allows the possibility that offspring will have either small or large leaves. To ensure offspring have the best chances of large leaves, large-leafed plants should be bred together. Choice d is incorrect. Preventing plants with large leaves from growing works to remove the large-leaf trait from subsequent generations rather than increase its appearance. 32. Choice d is correct. In the graph, temperature incr eases to the right and altitude increases upward. Any portion of the graph that has a negative slope, or slopes to the left, indicates a decrease in temperature. The graph has a negative slope in the troposphere and mesosphere layers. Choice a is incorrect. The graph has a negative slope within the mesosphere but a slight posi- tive slope in the exosphere. This means that t emperature decreases as altitude increases in the mesosphere but increases with altitude in the exosphere. Choice b is incorrect. The graph has a negative slope within the troposphere but a positive slope in the thermosphere. Even though the slope is not constant within the thermosphere, the slope remains positive within this layer. This means that temperature decreases in the troposphere but increases in the thermosphere. Choice c is incorrect. The graph has a positive slope within both the stratosphere and the ther - mosphere. This means that temperature incr eases with altitude in both layers. 33. Choice c is correct. The Alaska current is a war m current. The passage states that warm currents typically travel along the eastern coast of continents, but the Alaska current travels along the western coast of North America. Choice a is incorrect. Although the Alaska cur - rent does travel along the western coast of the c ontinent, the map key indicates that it is a warm current. Choice b is incorrect. The Alaska current does not follow the typical pattern for a warm cur - rent but is identied as a surface current on the map . Choice d is incorrect. The map key identies the Alaska current as a warm current. Warm cur - rents transport warm water originating near the e quator toward the poles. 527527 - - SCIENCE PRACTICE TEST 34. Choice d is correct. The blood type O can be p roduced only by the allele combination ii. A child receives one allele from each parent. Since the mother has an i but the father does not, the allele combination ii is not possible for their children. Choice a is incorrect. Based on the table, the mother's blood type is A. The child can receive I A or i from the mother and IA from the father, resulting in type A blood caused by the possible allele combinations I AIA or IAi. However, the child could receive IB from the father, which would result in a blood type different from the mother's. Choice b is incorrect. Based on the table, the father has blood type AB. The child can receive I A from the mother and IB from the father, resulting in the possible allele combination IAIB. This allele combination will produce the same blood type as the father's. Choice c is incorrect. Based on the table, the mother's blood type is A and the father's is AB. The child can receive I A or i from the mother and IA from the father, resulting in type A blood caused by the possible allele combinations IAIA or IAi. The child can receive IA from the mother and IB from the father, resulting in the blood type AB caused by the possible allele combina- tion IAIB. This means it is possible for the child to have the same blood type as one of the parents. 35. Choice c is correct. A ccording to the diagram, when a person's blood glucose level rises, the pancreas secretes insulin. The insulin signals body cells to absorb glucose from the blood and signals the liver to convert excess glucose into the storage molecule glycogen. These processes remove excess glucose from the blood, return- ing the blood glucose level to homeostasis. I nsulin injected into a diabetic person initiates the same pathway as insulin produced in the pancreas of a healthy person. Choice a is incorrect. Insulin signals the liver to convert and store excess glucose to glycogen, not to destroy the glucose. Choice b is incorrect. Insulin and glucagon do not signal each other but perform opposite functions. Insulin works to decrease blood glu- cose levels, while glucagon works to increase these le vels. Choice d is incorrect. Glucagon signals the breakdown of glycogen into glucose when blood glucose levels are low. Insulin signals the conversion of glucose to glycogen when blood glucose levels are high. 528528 chapter18 Social StudieS PRactice teSt This practice test is modeled on the format, content, and timing of the ofcial GED\u00ae Social Studies test and, like the ofcial exam, presents a series of questions that focus on the fundamentals of social stud-ies reasoning.

This excerpt is from a speech by George W. Bush given on March 19, 2008. Operation Iraqi Freedom was a remarkable display of military effectiveness. Forces from the U.K., Australia, Poland, and other allies joined our troops in the initial operations. As they advanced, our troops fought their way through sandstorms so intense that they blackened the daytime sky. Our troops engaged in pitched battles with Fedayeen Saddam, death squads acting on the orders of Saddam Hussein that obeyed neither the conventions of war nor the dictates of conscience. These death squads hid in schools, and they hid in hospitals, hoping to draw fire against Iraqi civilians. They used women and children as human shields. They stopped at nothing in their efforts to pre-vent us from prevailing, but they couldn't stop the coalition advance. Aided by the most effective and precise air campaign in history, coalition forces raced across 35 0 miles of enemy territory, destroying Republican Guard divisions, pushing through the Karbala Gap, capturing Saddam International Airport, and liberating Baghdad in less than one month. Because we acted, Saddam Hussein no longer fills fields with the remains of innocent men, wo men, and children. . . . Because we acted, Saddam's regime is no longer invading its neighbors or attacking them with chemical weapons and ballistic missiles. 1.B ased on the primary-source excerpt concern- ing a central idea of American foreign p olicy since 9/11, what was President Bush's purp ose f or launching Operation Iraqi Freedo m? a.t o liberate Baghdad in less than one mo nth by d estroying Republican Guard divisio ns b. t o liberate Iraqi people from a brutal reg ime and re move Saddam Hussein from powe r c.t o stop Saddam Hussein from inva ding other nat ions d.t o join countries in aiding Saddam Hussein' s co ntrol of the Iraqi people's natural rig hts2.W hich of the following statements is an opin- ion, NOT a fac t? a.\" coalition forces raced across 350 miles o f ene my territory, . . . liberating Baghda d in less than o ne month \" b. \"F orces from the U.K., Australia, Poland, and other al lies joined our troops in the init ial o perations. \" c.\" Our troops engaged in pitched battles w ith Fe dayeen Saddam, death squads acting o n the o rders of Saddam Hussein. \" d.\" Operation Iraqi Freedom was a remarkab le display o f military effectiveness. \" 530530 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST 3.

This excerpt is from a speech by Bill Clinton given on July 19, 1995. The purpose of affirmative action is to give our Nation a way to finally address the systemic exclu- sion of individuals of talent on the basis of their gender or race from opportunities to develop, p erform, achieve, and contribute. Affirmative action is an effort to develop a systematic approach to open the doors of education, employment, and business development opportunities to qualified individuals who happen to be members of groups that have experienced longstanding and persis- tent discrimination. It is a policy that grew out of many years of trying to navigate between two unacceptable p asts. One was to say simply that we declared discrimination illegal and that's enough. We saw that that way still relegated blacks with college degrees to jobs as railroad porters and kept women with degrees under a glass ceiling with a lower paycheck. The other path was simply to try to impose change by leveling draconian penalties on e mployers who didn't meet certain imposed, ultimately arbitrary, and sometimes unachievable quotas. That, too, was rejected out of a sense of fairness. So a middle ground was developed that would change an inequitable status quo gradually but firmly, by building the pool of qualified applicants for college, for contracts, for jobs, and giv- ing more people the chance to learn, work, and earn. When affirmative action is done right, it is flexible, it is fair , and it works. 9. According to the excerpt from Clinton's speech, afr mative action is a partial solution to which long-standing societal problem that has affected history? a. slave ry b. discrimination c. unemployment d. poverty 533533 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST 10. According to the excerpt, what changes would afr mative action cause to come about for minority groups that suffer from discrimination? a. It will give more people in these minority g roups the chance to work, learn, and earn a living by increasing the number of qualied applicants from these groups who are accepted for job positions and places in college. b. It will give fewer people in these minority g roups the chance to work, learn, and earn a living by decreasing the number of qualied applicants from these groups who are accepted for job positions and places in college. c. It will change nothing for minority groups and w ill instead only reduce penalties on employers who do not meet a certain quota of minority workers in their workplaces. d.

All of us know what those challenges are today\u2014a war with no end, a dependence on oil that threatens our future, schools where too many children aren't learning, and families struggling pay - check to paycheck despite working as hard as they can. We know the challenges. We've heard them. W e've talked about them for years. What's stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and s ensible plans. What's stopped us is the failure of leadership, the smallness of our politics\u2014the ease with which we're distracted by the petty and trivial, our chronic avoidance of tough deci- sions, our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and build-ing a working consensus to tackle big problems. For the last six years we've been told that our mounting debts don't matter, we've been told t hat the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion, we've been told that climate change is a hoax, and that tough talk and an ill-conceived war can replace diplomacy, and strategy, and foresight. And when all else fails, when Katrina happens, or the death toll in Iraq mounts, we've been told that our crises are somebody else's fault. We're dis- tracted from our real failures, and told to blame the other party, or gay people, or immigrants. And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration, we know what's filled the v oid. The cynics, and the lobbyists, and the special interests who've turned our government into a game only they can afford to play. They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills, they get the access while you get to write a letter, they think they own this government, but we're here today to take it back.

This is an excerpt from a speech about health care delivered to Congress by President Obama on September 9, 2009. Then there's the problem of rising cost. We spend one and a half times more per person on health care than any other country, but we aren't any healthier for it. This is one of the reasons that insur - ance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages. It's why so many employers, especially small businesses, are forcing their employees to pay more for insurance or are dropping their cov- erage entirely. It's why so many aspiring entrepreneurs cannot afford to open a business in the first p lace and why American businesses that compete internationally, like our automakers, are at a huge disadvantage. And it's why those of us with health insurance are also paying a hidden and growing tax for those without it, about $1,000 per year that pays for somebody else's emergency room and charitable care. Finally, our health care system is placing an unsustainable burden on taxpayers. When health c are costs grow at the rate they have, it puts greater pressure on programs like Medicare and Medicaid. If we do nothing to slow these skyrocketing costs, we will eventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other government program combined. Put simply, our health care problem is our deficit problem. Nothing else even comes close. Nothing else. 21. In the excerpt from Obama's speech on health car e, what type of statement is \"we aren't any healthier for it\"? a. sup ported fact b. statistic c. warning d. opinion 22. According to the excerpt from Obama's speech o n health care, what does he think will be the eventual effect of unchecked added pressure being put on Medicare and Medicaid from rap- idly increasing health-care costs? a. the government spending less on Medicare and M edicaid than every other program combined b. the government spending more on Medicare and M edicaid than every other program combined c. the shutdown of Medicare and Medicaid inst ead of other programs d. the government no longer spending any mo ney on Medicare and Medicaid 541541 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST 23.

The era known as the Industrial Revolution was a period in which fundamental changes occurred in agriculture, textile and metal manufacture, transportation, economic poli- cies and the social structure in England. . . . T he year 1760 is generally accepted as the \"eve\" of the Industrial Revolution. In reality, this eve began more than two centuries before this date. The late 18th century and the early 19th century brought to fruition the ideas and discoveries of those who had long passed on, such as, Galileo, Bacon, Des- cartes, and others.

This excerpt is from the Declaration of Independence. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. This excerpt is from a speech on civil rights given by President John F. Kennedy on June 11, 1963. This Nation was founded by men of many nations and backgrounds. It was founded on the prin-ciple that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened. Today we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the rights of all who wish to be free. And when Americans are sent to Viet-Nam or West Berlin, we do not ask for whites only. It ought to be possible, therefore, for American students of any color to attend any public institution they select without having to be backed up by troops. It ought to be possible for American consumers of any color to receive equal service in places of public accommodation, such as hotels and restaurants and theaters and retail stores, without being forced to resort to demonstrations in the street, and it ought to be possible for American citizens of any color to register and to vote in a free election without interference or fear of reprisal. It ought to be possible, in short, for every American to enjoy the privileges of being American without regard to his race or his color. In short, every American ought to have the right to be treated as he would wish to be treated, as one would wish his children to be treated. But this is not the case. The Negro baby born in America today, regardless of the section of the Nation in which he is born, has about one-half as much chance of completing a high school as a white baby born in the same place on the same day, one-third as much chance of completing college, one-third as much chance of becoming a professional man, twice as much chance of becoming unemployed, about one-seventh as much chance of earning $10,000 a year, a life expectancy which is 7 years shorter, and the pros - pects of earning only half as much. This is not a sectional issue. Difficulties over segregation and discrimination exist in every city, in every State of the Union, producing in many cities a rising tide of discontent that threatens the public safety. Nor is this a partisan issue. In a time of domestic crisis men of good will and generosity should be able to unite regardless of party or politics. This is not even a legal or legislative issue alone. It is better to settle these matters in the courts than on the streets, and new laws are needed at every level, but law alone cannot make men see right. We are confronted primarily with a moral issue. It is as old as the scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution. - TEST QUESTION: In your response, develop an argument about how President Kennedy's stance on the civil rights issues of the t ime reflected beliefs that were already built into the section of the Declaration of Independence quoted here, even though the Declaration of Independence was written centuries before civil rights for African Americans became a national focus. Incorporate relevant and specic evidence from the two excerpts and your knowledge of the enduring issue and circumstances surrounding the Civil Rights movement to support your analysis. 550550 TEST 557557 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST answers and e xplanations Part I 1. Choice b is correct. The liberation of the Iraqi p eople from a brutal ruling regime and the removal of Hussein from power are both goals that would have the ability to bring about all of the changes for Iraq that President Bush men- tions came about after the success of the opera- tion. Therefore, it is safe to say that this choice r epresents the main purpose of the launching of the operation by President Bush. Choice a is incorrect. While the liberation of Baghdad led to Operation Iraqi Freedom's suc- cess, it alone was not the purpose of the opera- tion. The capture of this one city would not ha ve been enough to bring about the other changes and freedoms for the Iraqi people that Bush mentions, such as those in the excerpt's nal paragraph. Choice c is incorrect. Stopping Hussein from invading nations was an outcome of the operation's success in removing Hussein from power, not the actual purpose of the operation. That purpose would be to remove Hussein, which would result in this benecial outcome. Choice d is incorrect. These nations joined forces for the common cause of the operation to stop Saddam Hussein's control of the Iraqi people's natural rights. 2. Choice d is correct. This statement is an opin-ion held and expressed by Bush. He uses the t erm \"remarkable,\" which is inherently a term of opinion. Bush may feel that the operation \"was a remarkable display of military effective- ness,\" but this is an opinion, not a fact. C hoice a is incorrect. All of these events are facts that are conrmed by the actions and technicalities of the operation. All of these actions were actually carried out during the operation. Choice b is incorrect. This is a fact. These forces did all join with the U.S. in the beginning of the operation. Choice c is incorrect. This is a fact of the actions carried out during the operation when troops actually did battle Saddam's death squads. 558558 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST 3. Choice c is correct. A ll of the atrocities carried out by Saddam that Bush mentions in his speech serve to show the justication for the operation and show just how brutal Saddam's regime was and how detrimental it was to the citizens of that regime who were exposed to atrocities. Bush mentions in the end all the neg- ative things that have been stopped due to the o peration, once again bolstering its justication. Choice a is incorrect. Everything that Bush says about the operation in this part of his speech implies that the operation was justied and successful. He mentions on many occasions the brutality of Saddam's regime and gives exam- ples. He then goes on to list atrocities that have b een stopped due to the operation. Choice b is incorrect. Everything that Bush says would imply that he feels the operation was justied. However, the realities of Saddam's regime that Bush mentions only lend credit to this justication. Instead of discrediting the operation, the atrocities that Saddam imposed on his people only bolster the idea that it was justied. Choice d is incorrect. While the atrocities of Saddam's regime that Bush mentions justify the operation, Bush does not disagree with that jus- tication. The fact that he mentions all of said at rocities implies that he agrees that the opera- tion was justied, and in the last paragraph he g oes on to mention all of the atrocities that have been stopped due to the operation. He never expresses any doubts about the opera-tion's justication. 4. Choice c is correct. The legislative branch in volves the Senate and the House of Representatives, and the executive branch con-sists of the president and his administration. T he fact that the Senate must have a two-thirds agreement in order to allow the president to make a treaty means that the legislative branch is checking the power of the executive branch so that the president does not have full and unop- posed power to make treaties. C hoice a is incorrect. The president is part of the executive branch, and that branch is not checking the powers of any other branches but actually having its own powers checked. Choice b is incorrect. The judicial branch involves the courts, and this branch is not even mentioned in this section of the Constitution. Choice d is incorrect. The judicial branch does not even factor into this section of the Constitution. 559559 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST 5. Choice b is correct. The system of checks and balanc es in the U.S. government is meant to separate the powers of the branches of government and provide a balance to those powers so that one person or group does not hold all power, which could then be abused and exploited. Choice a is incorrect. The idea behind checks and balances between the branches of government is to keep a balance of power, not to allow the legislative branch to have power over the executive or judicial branches. In the excerpt, this check on the power of the presi- dent does not imply that the Senate has power o ver the president or courts, but rather it is a balance of power. Choice c is incorrect. If the president had the ability to check the power of all the other branches, his power would be more like a dicta- torship than a presidency. The system of checks and balanc es is meant to prevent this. Also, the excerpt shows that the president does not have this power due to the fact that the Senate is actually checking the president's power in this example. Choice d is incorrect. While the example in the excerpt does refer to this check on the power of the president, this is only an example of one instance of checks and balances in the U.S. government and not the actual point of this system. There are many other examples of checks and balances written into the U.S. Constitution. 6. Choice c is correct. W ithout a two-thirds agreement in the Senate, the president cannot make a treaty. This is part of the system of checks and balances in the U.S. government. It is a check on the power of the executive branch. Choice a is incorrect. The president is the one who makes treaties with the consent of the Sen- ate. Therefore, failure to receive a two-thirds ag reement would make a treaty impossible, not just in the Senate but for the president as well. Choice b is incorrect. The Senate does not make the treaties; the president does. The Senate con- sults with the president and must agree with the t reaty in order for it to be made. Choice d is incorrect. Without a two-thirds agreement in the Senate, the president cannot make a treaty. This is part of the system of checks and balances in the U.S. government. It is a check on the power of the executive branch. 560560 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST 7. Choice a is correct. The concept of popular so vereignty implies that the government holds authority through the consent of the governed, and if the governed fails to approve of said authority, the people can change it. A dictator - ship does not take the consent of the governed int o account, and one individual rules without consent. Choice b is incorrect. The concept of popular sovereignty implies that the government holds authority through the consent of the governed and if the governed fails to approve of said authority, the government can change it. A dictatorship does not take the consent of the governed into account, and one individual rules without consent. Choice c is incorrect. The concept of popular sovereignty does not necessarily mean that the government is run by the most popular person, but rather that the leader of the government has consent of the governed. A dictatorship does not necessarily mean that the government is run by the least popular person, but rather that said person does not take the consent of the governed into account. Choice d is incorrect. A dictatorship does not mean that the government is run by the most popular person, but rather that the leader of the government does not take the consent of the government into account. The concept of popular sovereignty does not mean that the government is run by the least popular person, but rather that said person has the consent of the governed. 8. The executive branch is made up of the presi-dent and the president's Cabinet. T he legislative branch is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives, collectively known as Congress. The judicial branch is made up of the Supreme Court. 9. Choice b is correct. A t the beginning of the excerpt, Clinton references the problems of dis- crimination from the past and says that it con- tinues to plague the country. He makes it ap parent that afrmative action is a way to lessen this discrimination and hopefully solve many problems that it creates for minority groups. Choice a is incorrect. Slavery was a problem that has been abolished by law since the Civil War and Reconstruction. Afrmative action is not addressing slavery or a solution. Choice c is incorrect. While unemployment can be caused by discrimination, afrmative action addresses discrimination, which could then inadvertently help with unemployment as a side effect. Afrmative action is not directly addressing unemployment or providing a direct solution to it. Choice d is incorrect. While poverty can be caused by discrimination, afrmative action addresses discrimination, which could then inadvertently help with unemployment and poverty as a side effect. Afrmative action is not directly addressing poverty or providing a direct solution to it. 561561 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST 10. Choice a is correct. A ccording to Clinton, afrmative action will benet minority groups \"by building the pool of qualied applicants for college, for contracts, for jobs, and giving more people the chance to learn, work, and earn. When afrmative action is done right, it is flexi- ble, it is fair, and it works.\" C hoice b is incorrect. This change is the opposite of the purpose of afrmative action and is the opposite of the correct answer. According to Clinton, afrmative action will benet minority groups \"by building the pool of qualied applicants for college, for contracts, for jobs, and giving more people the chance to learn, work, and earn. When afrmative action is done right, it is flexible, it is fair, and it works.\" Choice c is incorrect. Clinton mentions that the idea to have penalties for employers who fail to meet high quotas was actually rejected and afrmative action helps to keep this from happening. However, afrmative action has as its main goal the improvement of conditions for minority groups. Therefore, the idea that it would not change anything for minority groups is wrong. Choice d is incorrect. Both of these statements represent things that afrmative action is trying to x. Afrmative action would increase the amount of minority groups in college, not decrease their numbers. According to Clinton, afrmative action will benet minority groups \"by building the pool of qualied applicants for college, for contracts, for jobs, and giving more people the chance to learn, work, and earn. When afrmative action is done right, it is flexible, it is fair, and it works.\" 11. Choice d is correct. Both excerpts mention the imp ortance of liberty for all citizens. The Declaration of Independence says all men have the right to liberty, and the Constitution says that the government must \"secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity.\" Choice a is incorrect. The concept of all men being equal is mentioned only in the excerpt from the Declaration of Independence. Choice b is incorrect. This idea is mentioned only in the excerpt from the Declaration of Independence. Choice c is incorrect. Neither excerpt mentions anything about slavery or the need to abolish it. Furthermore, the Declaration of Independence was made during a time when slavery was still very prominent. 12. Choice b is correct. Popular sovereignty refers t o a government run by the people, where the people have the ability to affect, change, and replace their government as they see t. This is what the excerpt is essentially describing. Choice a is incorrect. Federalism refers to the concept of a federal government. This excerpt references the ability to replace the government; it doesn't describe a federal system of government. Choice c is incorrect. Socialism deals with a centralized control of wealth in order to make the spread of wealth more equal. This has nothing to do with the ability to replace the government. The term socialism is not preceded by the word popular. Choice d is incorrect. Capitalism deals with the idea of free markets and private ownership in the economy. This is an economic system, not a system of replacing a destructive form of government. 562562 - - ___ SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST 13. The correct answer is 122. The mean is the average. Therefore, add up all o f the numbers in the column listing the num- ber of men killed: 49 + 73 + 140 + 226 = 488. T hen divide the answer by the number of values given: 488 = 122.4 14. Choice b is correct. The United States entering W orld War II took the rate from 14.5% in 1941 to 7% in 1942, or a 7.5% decrease. Choice a is incorrect. FDR's rst New Deal took the rate from 37% in 1933 to 33% in 1934, or a 4% drop. This was not the largest decrease. Choice c is incorrect. The stock market crash increased the unemployment rate by 9%, from 5.5% in 1929 to 14.5% in 1930. Choice d is incorrect. In the year following the German invasion of Poland, the unemployment rate dropped from 25% to 21%, or a 4% drop. This was not the largest decrease. 15. The answer is private, based on an und erstanding and comprehension of the denition and logical reasoning to understand how it can t into the statement. 16. Choice a is correct. The Democrat bar is the hig hest and is shown on the graph with political parties being labeled on the x-axis (horizon-tally) and the percentage of members labeled alo ng the y-axis (vertically). This allows a viewer to see that the Democratic Party has the highest percentage of members. Choice b is incorrect. While the Democratic Party does have the most members based on the percentages, the political parties are labeled on the x-axis, not the y-axis. Also, percentages are labeled on the y-axis, not the x-axis. Choice c is incorrect. While the political parties are labeled on the x-axis and percentages are labeled on the y-axis, which shows, through the use of bars, which party has the most members, the Libertarian Party does not have the highest bar. Therefore, it does not have the most members. Choice d is incorrect. The Libertarian Party does not have the highest bar representing per - centage of members and consequently does not ha ve the most members. Also, political parties are labeled on the x-axis, not the y-axis, and percentages are labeled on the y-axis, not the x. 17. Choice b is correct. The key indicates that a cir cle surrounding a gray triangle includes both \"urban rail transit system under construction in 2010\" and \"high-speed rail routes under construction in 2010.\" Choice a is incorrect. The symbol for \"urban rail transit system under construction in 2010\" is a simple gray triangle. Choice c is incorrect. The key indicates that a circle surrounding a gray triangle includes both \"urban rail transit system under construction in 2010\" and \"high-speed rail routes under construction in 2010.\" Choice d is incorrect. High-growth power centers are designated by a circle surrounding a black triangle. 563563 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST 18. Choice d is correct. The bars indicating e xpenditures for that time period are increasing. They increase from around $40 million to $80 million based on the dollar amount labeled on the y-axis (vertical) and years labeled on the x-axis (horizontal). Choice a is incorrect. The bars indicating expenditures for that time period are not decreasing. They increase from around $40 million to $80 million based on the dollar amount labeled on the y-axis (vertical) and years labeled on the x-axis (horizontal). Choice b is incorrect. The bars indicating expenditures for that time period are increasing, but they never decrease during that time. They increase from around $40 million to $80 million based on the dollar amount labeled on the y-axis (vertical) and years labeled on the x-axis (horizontal). Choice c is incorrect. The bars indicating expenditures for that time period are increasing, and they never decrease during that time. They increase from around $40 million to $80 million based on the dollar amount labeled on the y-axis (vertical) and years labeled on the x-axis (horizontal). 19. Choice a is correct. Loaded language means languag e that is highly emotive and used to gain support, sway emotions, degrade others, or push an agenda. Hoax and frustration are words that are being used by Obama to sway voters against the previous political administration in order to win the presidency in the coming election. Choice b is incorrect. Loaded language means language that is highly emotive and used to gain support, sway emotions, degrade others, or push an agenda. Today and decisions are not words that serve this purpose in this excerpt. Choice c is incorrect. Loaded language means language that is highly emotive and used to gain support, sway emotions, degrade others, or push an agenda. Void and lobbyists are not words that serve this purpose in this excerpt. Choice d is incorrect. Loaded language means language that is highly emotive and used to gain support, sway emotions, degrade others, or push an agenda. Page and diplomacy are not words that serve this purpose in this excerpt. 20. Choice b is correct. Obama is publicizing a p oint of view or political cause. He does not acknowledge who has been telling Americans this but implies that it is coming from members of the government. Obama wants to replace these members by hopefully winning the presidency. This speech announces his political campaign for president. Choice a is incorrect. Obama is stating his opinions. Obama wants the people hearing him to feel he is right about these issues. He does not present an economic chart. Choice c is incorrect. Obama is stating his opinions. Obama wants the people hearing him to feel he is right about these issues. He does not present statistical facts. Choice d is incorrect. The third paragraph of Obama's speech does not mention anything that he promises to do when he becomes president. 564564 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST 21. Choice d is correct. In the excerpt, Obama does not g ive any factual evidence to support this statement. Therefore it falls into the category of an opinion or unsupported claim. Choice a is incorrect. In the excerpt, Obama does not give any factual evidence to support this statement. Choice b is incorrect. A statistic is a piece of data that typically comes from a study involving a large amount of numerical data. Obama does not mention any numbers in this statement. Choice c is incorrect. Obama's statement is not a warning that something will happen. 22. Choice b is correct. If Medicare and Medicaid ar e struggling, then the government would have to spend more on them in order to help the programs. Obama explicitly says, \"we will eventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other government program combined.\" Choice a is incorrect. If Medicare and Medicaid are struggling, then the government would have to spend more on them in order to help the programs, not less. Obama explicitly says, \"we will eventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other government program combined.\" Choice c is incorrect. While Obama mentions that Medicare and Medicaid are struggling due to rapidly increasing health care costs, he never mentions that this would lead to the shutdown of these programs. It is more likely that the government would spend more money on them instead of shutting them down. Also, due to the fact that so many people rely on these programs, it would take a lot more to actually shut them down. Choice d is incorrect. This is the opposite of what Obama implies will happen. The government would more likely spend more money on them to help them when they are struggling. If the government stopped spending money on them, their struggles would increase to the point where they could no longer function. Also, Obama explicitly says, \"we will eventually be spending more on Medicare and Medicaid than every other government program combined.\" 565565 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST 23. Choice c is correct. This was the goal of his e xpedition in 1492. The spice trade was very lucrative at the time, and Columbus had the idea that he could sail in the direction of the Americas and eventually reach Asia, thereby avoiding overland trade routes in the other direction. He did not realize that there was a large landmass in the way, and this is how he discovered the Americas. Choice a is incorrect. Columbus' rst expedi- tion in 1492 had nothing to do with nding ne w territory. He did not know that the Ameri- cas existed since this expedition brought him int o contact with the land for the rst time. While he did eventually make future expedi-tions to the Americas on behalf of Spain, this was aft er he knew it existed. Choice b is incorrect. He did not know that the Americas existed since this expedition brought him into contact with the land for the rst time. While he did eventually make future expeditions to the Americas for goods on behalf of Spain, he could not be planning an expedition to trade with native peoples who he did not know existed. Choice d is incorrect. Columbus' rst expedi- tion in 1492 had nothing to do with creating a ne w settlement for Spain in the Americas. He did not know that the Americas existed since this expedition brought him into contact with the land for the rst time, and he could not be looking to make a settlement in a place he didn't know existed. While he did eventually make future expeditions to the Americas on behalf of Spain, this was after he knew it existed. 24. The correct answer is Navy's Women Accepted f or Voluntary Emergency Service, or WAVES. Based on the pie chart, 0.3% of the women joining the military during World War II were Women's Airforce Service Pilots or WASPs, 4% were Navy Nurse Corps, 17% were American Nurse Corps, 6% were Marine Corps Women's Reserves, and 3% were Coast Guard Women's Reserves or SPARS. The combination of all of those percentages comes out to 30.3% of women joining the military. This is closest to the 28% of the Navy's Women Accepted for Vol- untary Emergency Service rather than the 42% that was the Women's Army Corps. 25. Choice a is correct. The map shows countries in the East ern Bloc in darker gray and the Western Bloc in lighter gray. Turkey is colored lighter gray and is, therefore, part of the Western Bloc. Choice b is incorrect. The map shows countries in the Eastern Bloc in darker gray and the Western Bloc in lighter gray. Turkey is colored lighter gray and is, therefore, part of the Western Bloc. Choice c is incorrect. The Iron Curtain is a dividing line. Therefore, it is not one of the divisions that countries could be put into during the Cold War. It is shown as a white line, which Turkey only barely touches. Choice d is incorrect. This map does not give any information about Turkey's relationship with the United States. The United States is not depicted on the map. 566566 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST 26. Choice b is correct. Bush never mentions that the g oal is to control the local leadership and economy in Iraq, but rather the goal is to help the Iraqi people eventually be able to completely control their own government. Therefore, this is not a reason that it was important to have civilian experts in Iraq. Choice a is incorrect. Bush explicitly states, \"they're helping to strengthen responsible lead- ers and build up local economies.\" Therefore, this c hoice is a reason that it was important to have civilian experts in Iraq. Choice c is incorrect. Bush explicitly states, \"they're helping give ordinary Iraqis con-dence.\" Therefore, this choice is a reason that it was imp ortant to have civilian experts in Iraq. Choice d is incorrect. Bush explicitly states, \"they can claim their place in a free Iraq.\" Therefore, this choice is a reason that it was important to have civilian experts in Iraq. 27. Choice c is correct. A p rot is a nancial gain. Since the company only spent $1 on the product and then sold it for $2.35 to consumers, the company makes a nancial gain of $1.35 every time a consumer purchases the product. The company makes a prot of $1.35. Choice a is incorrect. A monopoly is an entity that has exclusive control over a product or service. A dollar amount cannot be an example of something that has complete control over a product or service. Also, the example gives no indication that the company has exclusive control of the product. Choice b is incorrect. The $1.35 would only be a part of the expense for the consumer, not an expense for the company. The company's only expense was the $1 that it spent on the product before selling it. Choice d is incorrect. Since the company only spent $1 on the product and then sold it for $2.35 to consumers, the company makes a nancial gain of $1.35 every time that a consumer purchases the product. The company makes a prot of $1.35, not a loss. 28. The correct answer is tariff. A tar iff is a tax or duty placed on imports or exports. 29. Choice b is correct. The person in this situation w ould not qualify for the card. He or she is not old enough, is a high school student, and does not have an income greater than $4,000. Choices a, b, and c are incorrect. The people in these situations would qualify for the card. They are old enough, are students of an accredited university, and have an income greater than $4,000. 567567 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST 30. Choice c is correct. The excerpt mentions that the e conomy benets in the short term from substantial spending increase during the conflict; however, this leads to negative residual effects that hurt the economy in the long term after the war is over and there is no longer a spending boom related to the conflict. Choice a is incorrect. The excerpt mentions that the economy benets in the short term from substantial spending increase during the conflict; however, this leads to negative residual effects that hurt the economy in the long term after the war is over and there is no longer a spending boom related to the conflict. Choice b is incorrect. The excerpt mentions that the economy benets in the short term from substantial spending increase during the conflict; however, this leads to negative residual effects that hurt the economy in the long term after the war is over and there is no longer a spending boom related to the conflict. Therefore, wars denitely have economic effects. Choice d is incorrect. The excerpt mentions that the economy benets in the short term from substantial spending increase during the conflict; however, this leads to negative residual effects that hurt the economy in the long term after the war is over and there is no longer a spending boom related to the conflict. The effects are not all negative due to the positive short-term effects. 31. Choice a is correct. Dark gray bars represent the amount that the U .S. spent on metal exploration. The two lines represent the price of gold and copper. Based on this information, between the years 2006 and 2008, the prices of gold and copper along with U.S. spending on metal exploration all increased. Choices b, c, and d are incorrect. Dark gray bars represent the amount that the U.S. spent on metal exploration. The two lines represent the price of gold and copper. Based on this information, between the years 2006 and 2008, the prices of gold and copper along with U.S. spending on metal exploration all increased. 32. Choice c is correct. The quote from the rst sour ce says, \"in reality, this eve began more than two centuries before this date,\" while the quote from the second source does not mention this idea. Choice a is incorrect. Both quotes mention that the time period of the Industrial Revolution was in the 18th century. Choice b is incorrect. Both quotes dene the Industrial revolution as a time of great change. \"The era known as the Industrial Revolution was a period in which fundamental changes occurred\" and \"Industrial Revolution, in modern history, is the process of change from an agrarian, handicraft economy to one dominated by industry and machine manufacture.\" Choice d is incorrect. Both sources mention that England is where the Industrial Revolution began and grew. \"The era known as the Industrial Revolution was a period in which fundamental changes occurred in agriculture, textile and metal manufacture, transportation, economic policies and the social structure in England\" and \"This process began in England in the 18th century and from there spread to other parts of the world.\" 568568 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST 33. Choice d is correct. The Japanese region covers an island, borders the Korean region, and is north of the Malay/Indonesian and Papuan regions. Choice a is incorrect. The Turkic region is above the Malay/Indonesian and Papuan regions, but it is not covering an island and does not border the Korean region. Choice b is incorrect. The Thai region is above the Malay/Indonesian and Papuan regions, but it is not covering an island and does not border the Korean region. Choice c is incorrect. The Han region is above the Malay/Indonesian and Papuan regions and borders the Korean region, but it is not covering an island. 34. Choice a is correct. The map key shows that stat es labeled with the darkest gray have a population size of 25,000,000 or more, and the states labeled with one shade lighter have a population size of 15,000,000 to 24,999,999. In the 2009 map, Texas is colored the second to darkest shade, and in the 2011 map, it is colored the darkest shade. Therefore, its population increased from the 15,000,000-24,999,999 range to the 25,000,000 or more range. 35. Choice d is correct. Texas and California are b oth colored the darkest shade of gray, representing a population of 25,000,000 or more. Therefore, the population of California is in the same category as the population of Texas according to the information given in the map. Choice a is incorrect. California does not have a larger population than Texas. Both are colored the darkest shade of gray, representing a population of 25,000,000 or more. Therefore, the population of California is in the same category as the population of Texas according to the information given in the map. The map does not show exact population numbers, so there is no way to determine which one actually has a slightly larger or smaller population. Choice b is incorrect. Texas and California are both colored the darkest shade of gray, representing a population of 25,000,000 or more. Tennessee has a smaller population than either Texas or California. Choice c is incorrect. Texas and California are both colored the darkest shade of gray, representing a population of 25,000,000 or more. Therefore, the population of California is in the same category as the population of Texas according to the information given in the map. The map does not show exact population numbers, so there is no way to determine which one actually has a slightly larger or smaller population. 569569 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST Part II Your Extended Response will be scored based on three traits, or elements: Trait 1: Creation of arguments and use of evidence Trait 2: D evelopment of ideas and organizational structure Trait 3: C larity and command of standard English conventions Your essay will be scored on a 4-point scale\u2014Trait 1 is worth 0-2 points, and Traits 2 and 3 are worth 0-1 point.

While cultural, economic, and political factors may have inter - fered with the achievement of this goal for many years, its inclusion in the founding documents of the nation underlines the enduring nature of this issue. The Declaration of Independence is widely r egarded as the rst formal expression of American democracy. The document states that \"all men are cre-ated equal,\" and refers to \"certain unalienable rights,\" meaning that these basic rights cannot be taken away. While the United States was not the rst nation to sug-gest that citizens should be given basic rights, it was undo ubtedly one of the rst to support the notion of equal rights for all citizens. This extended basic protec-tions to even the lowest classes of society, and also held the higher classes accountable to the same laws as every- one else. At the time the Declaration of Independence was w ritten, the idea that \"all men are created equal\" was, in many ways, difcult to implement in its purest form. Slaves were not considered as equals, and were in fact treated by the law as property; women were also excluded from many of the basic protections and rights that men enjoyed. Even among free white men, the application of equality was inconsistent at best. For example, in the nation's rst elections, only wealthy, land-owning men were allowed to vote. The history of the United States is a history of e dging ever closer to the ideals expressed in the Declara- tion of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. The o bstacles that have impeded this progress have been eco- nomic and social factors such as slavery and prejudice. Whe n slavery ended in the mid-nineteenth century, the U.S. Congress passed constitutional amendments int ended to protect the voting rights and citizenship of former slaves. However, as Kennedy stated, \"law alone cannot make men see right.\" These laws, despite their intent, proved ineffective at preserving the rights of A frican Americans in many situations. For example, many parts of the country established separate facilities for blacks such as schools, bathrooms, and even drink-ing fountains. However, these facilities rarely met the same standards as those for whites. This sort of funda- mental racial discrimination led to conditions like the ones Kennedy lists in his speech: African Americans were likely to be poorer, less educated, and to die sooner than white Americans. This is why Kennedy supported new civil rights legislation intended to strengthen pro-tections of the rights of all people, regardless of race\u2014 br ing the United States one step closer to the dream of a nation where, indeed, all men are created equal. About this essay: This essay has earned the maximum number of p oints in each trait for a total of 4 points. Trait 1: Creation of Arguments and Use of Evidence The sample response presents an argument about the r ole of equality in the Civil Rights movement and how it relates to the very beginnings of the founding of the United States, even though the founding fathers did not yet realize that the idea of equality would be used in this way. The test taker's argument cites multiple ideas from the source texts that bolster his or her position. Additionally, the writer incorpo- rates into the response background knowledge about the importance of equality throughout U.S. history in general, and the role of equality in the Civil Rights movement in particular. Taken as a whole, the response offers an argument that is closely aligned to what is directed by the prompt and is well supported by the source texts. Trait 2: Development of Ideas and Organizational S tructure This response earns one point in Trait 2 because it mak es clear and understandable connections between ideas and establishes a progression in which one idea logically leads into the next, starting from the very 573573 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST beginning: Although equal civil rights for all Ameri- cans, regardless of race, were not guaranteed by law unt il the 1960s, the same ideals that inspired the civil rights movement were part of the basic structure of American government from its creation, nearly two centuries before. The main points are fully developed, with mul- tiple details given in support of each. Additionally, this response applies a level of formality appropriate for communicating in workplace and academic set-tings, while also keeping in mind the purpose of the task, which is to present a well-supported argument. Trait 3: Clarity and Command of Standard English C onventions This response earns one point on Trait 3 because it e ffectively applies standard English language usage and conventions to convey ideas with clarity. In gen-eral, the response contains minimal mechanical e rrors, and the errors that do exist do not impede readers' understanding. The response contains lan-guage appropriate for expressing its ideas and thoug htfully composed sentences that generally avoid wordiness and awkwardness. Additionally, clarity and flow of the response are enhanced with varied sen- tence structure and appropriate application of transi- tional words and phrases to connect sentences, par agraphs, and ideas. Remember, however, that because the Extended R esponse question on the GED\u00ae Social Studies test asks for a draft written in approximately 25 minutes, there is no expectation that your response be com-pletely free of convention and usage errors. Sample Score 2 Essay In Kennedy's speech, he states that \"every American o ught to have the right to be treated as he would wish to be treated, as one would wish his children to be treated.\" This idea directly reflects the beliefs held by the Founding Fathers, as evidenced in the statement \"all men are created equal\" found in the declaration of independence. For a number or reasons at the time of the signing o f the declaration of independence \"all men\" did not include slaves and women. At the time of Kennedy's speech, Africans Americans still weren't being treated as equals in America, especially in the south. I know this is true because my grandmother lived in Mississippi dur - ing that time. Kennedy also states in his speech how A frican Americans were poorer and did not live as long as white people. Kennedy argued that the issue of equality is a mor al one that goes all the way back to the Constitu- tion. Actually, it goes back to the declaration of inde-pendence, which came rst and says \"all men are c reated equal.\" So he supported new laws to make sure that people all other races were all treated fairly. This was exactly what the Founding Fathers argued in favor of, even though they couldn't really do it themselves at the time. About this essay: This essay has earned 1 of 2 possible points in Trait 1, 0 points in Trait 2, and 1 point in trait 3, for a total of 2 out of the 4 maximum points. Trait 1: Creation of Arguments and Use of Evidence This somewhat brief response offers an argument that demonstrates an understanding of how the enduring issue of equality for all men is presented in both of the excerpts: [Kennedy's] idea directly reflects the beliefs held by the Founding Fathers, as evidenced in the statement \"all men are created equal\" found in the declaration of independence. The writer also provides some evidence from b oth excerpts; for example, in the third paragraph: He argues that the issue of equality is a moral one that goes all the way back to the Constitution. Actually, it goes back to the declaration of independence, which came rst and says \"all men are created equal.\" However, the writer also interjects a personal aside about his or her grandmother that is unrelated to the excerpts. Though this brief sample response is connected t o the prompt and the excerpts, it does not offer 574574 - - SOCIAL STUDIES PRACTICE TEST much information beyond what is presented in the excerpts about the enduring issue of equality or the Civil Rights movement in the 1960s, so it earns only one point in this trait. Trait 2: Development of Ideas and Organizational S tructure This response does not earn a point in Trait 2. A lthough it does demonstrate an understanding of the task, the sequence of ideas is unclear and only limited ideas are developed. For example, the writer begins the second paragraph with: For a number or reasons at the time of the signing of the declaration of independence \"all men\" did not include slaves and women. But he or she does elaborate upon those rea- sons other than at the closing of the essay: e ven though [the Founding Fathers] couldn't really do it themselves at the time. Trait 3: Clarity and Command of Standard English C onventions This response earns one point on Trait 3. In general, the response contains minimal mechanical errors (though, glaringly, the writer does not capitalize Dec- laration of Independence thr oughout); however, these errors do not impede readers' understanding. The response contains appropriate language for express-ing its ideas and thoughtfully composed sentences that g enerally avoid wordiness and awkwardness. Sample Score 0 Essay The foundling fathers beleived that all man were cre-ated equal and we all have rights. I beleive this too and s o does JFK.

Difculties over segregation and discrimination e xist in every city, in every State of the Union, produc- ing in many cities a rising tide of discontent that threat- ens the public safety. Nor is this a partisan issue. In a t ime of domestic crisis men of good will and generosity should be able to unite regardless of party or politics. This is not even a legal or legislative issue alone. About this essay: This essay earns a score of 0 in each of the three traits. Trait 1: Creation of Arguments and Use of Evidence This sample response earns a score of 0 in Trait 1. It is e xtremely brief, is composed mostly of direct quota- tions or paraphrases from the excerpts, and attempts an argument that is barely connected to the ideas in the excerpts: The foundling fathers beleived that all man were created equal and we all have rights. I beleive this too and so does JFK. Therefore, it is not sufciently connected to the prompt. Trait 2: Development of Ideas and Organizational S tructure This sample response earns a score of 0 in Trait 2. The o rganizational structure is scattered, and the progres- sion of the one idea (Kennedy recognized the need to pass la ws for equality) is barely discernible. Trait 3: Clarity and Command of Standard English C onventions This sample response earns a score of 0 in Trait 2. The b ulk of the response is composed of text lifted directly from the excerpts, with the exceptions of the rst paragraph and Laws needed to be passed JFK he passed them and the world is better today.
