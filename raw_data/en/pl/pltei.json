UWA researchers have conducted an Australian-first study using interviews with 29 parents in Fremantle and Adelaide who refused or delayed vaccinations. They found a \"symbiotic relationship\" between the anti-vaccination movement and alternative medicine. Many of the parents viewed vaccines as toxic and \"big pharma\" as tainted by greed. They preferred the do-it-yourself autonomy of alternative medicine and glossed over profit-making and suggestions of ineffectiveness. They felt empowered making their own decisions for their children and rejected the population-wide approach of vaccinations. Some reported that natural therapies were demeaned by an arrogant scientific approach which only believed in what could be proven. Dr Katie Attwell, senior lecturer at the UWA School of Social Science, said the study gave health professionals and policy makers some cues on how to promote vaccination. Regulating or restricting alternative medicines would not necessarily help the cause. \"You read that some CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) providers are telling parents vaccines are a bad idea and you might have that instinct that we should go after the CAM providers,\" Dr Attwell said. \"Some people think maybe we should have some kind of campaign pointing out that there's also profit-making inherent in CAM . \"We were really reluctant to go down that path because our data didn't support it.\" Dr Attwell said health professionals could learn from the alternative medicine movement. They could review the language they use when talking about vaccines and try to give parents a greater understanding and sense of ownership. \"If CAM (complementary and alternative medicine) disciplines are helping people to gather information, inform themselves, feel responsible and feel like they're in control, perhaps there's something there for Western medicine to learn from,\" Dr Attwell said. The study has been published in the January edition of the Social Science and Medical journal. Get the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox. Sign up for our emails "}
