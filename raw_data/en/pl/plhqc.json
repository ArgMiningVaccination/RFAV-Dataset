The results of the phase 3 trial have shown [clinical efficacy]of BBV152. We aimed to evaluate the [effectiveness]of Delhi, symptoms COVID-19 and had an RT-PCR test for [SARS-CoV-2]during the peak of the second [wave]of the COVID-19 pandemic in [India]between April 15 and May 15, 2021. Cases (test-positives) and controls (test-negatives) were matched (11) on the basis of age and [gender]. The odds of [vaccination]with BBV152 were compared between cases and controls and adjusted for level of [occupational exposure](to COVID-19), previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and calendar [time], using conditional [logistic regression]. The primary outcome was [effectiveness]of two doses of BBV152 (with the second [dose]received at least 14 days before testing) in reducing the odds of symptomatic RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, expressed as (1 - [odds ratio]) FINDINGS:Between April 15 and May 15, 3732 individuals had an RT-PCR test. Of these, 2714 symptomatic [employees]had data on [vaccination]status, and 1068 matched case-control pairs were available for [analysis]. The adjusted [effectiveness]of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 50% (95% CI 33-62; p<0\u00b70001). The adjusted [effectiveness]of two doses administered at least 28 days before testing was 46% (95% CI 22-62) and administered at least 42 days before testing was 57% (21-76). After excluding participants with previous SARS-CoV-2 infections, the adjusted [effectiveness]of two doses administered at least 14 days before testing was 47% (95% CI 29-61). INTERPRETATION:This study shows the [effectiveness]of two doses of BBV152 against symptomatic COVID-19 in the context of a huge [surge]in cases, presumably dominated by the potentially immune-evasive [delta](B.1.617.2) variant of [SARS-CoV-2]. Our findings support the ongoing roll-out of this [vaccine]to help control the spread of [SARS-CoV-2], while continuing the emphasis on adherence to non-pharmacological [measures]. FUNDING:None.
