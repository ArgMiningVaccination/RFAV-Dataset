Spikevax contains elasomeran, a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) with instructions for producing a protein from the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Spikevax is also available as two adapted vaccines: - Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 contains elasomeran and an additional mRNA molecule, imelasomeran, with instructions for producing a protein from an additional mRNA molecule, davesomeran, with instructions for producing a protein from the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of SARS-CoV-2.
