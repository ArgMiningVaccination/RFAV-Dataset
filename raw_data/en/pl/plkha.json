Purpose The purpose of this FOA is to identify and evaluate the ongoing and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, focusing specifically on governmental (local, state, tribal, federal) policy and programmatic actions that address two specific social determinants of health: food/nutrition security and housing security. Applications are requested to examine how these food/nutrition and housing policies and programs aimed at lessening the effects of the pandemic impacted health and health equity in individuals, families, and communities from health disparity populations. Health disparity populations include racial and ethnic minorities, socioeconomically disadvantaged populations, underserved rural populations, and sexual and gender minorities. Background The COVID-19 pandemic is both a health as well as a human, economic, and social crisis. While there are promising signs of economic recovery, many households are yet to recover from job losses or cuts. The long-term effects on the health and well-being of the nation, beyond the enormous morbidity and mortality, are just beginning to be realized. Of particular concern is the impact of the pandemic on populations who experience health disparities. The pandemic vividly highlighted ongoing social problems that influenced health and health equity before the onset of the pandemic, and then exacerbated many of these problems. Two major factors impacted by the pandemic are food/nutrition security and housing security. Food and nutrition insecurity are well-known social determinants of health for both adults and children. For example, adults in households with more severe food insecurity are more likely to have chronic health conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary heart disease, depression, and increased risk of mortality. Children who are food insecure are twice as likely to report fair or poor health compared to those who are food secure. Among children, food insecurity is also associated with adverse behavioral and academic outcomes. COVID-19 has disrupted food access and negatively impacted food security, which is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall prevalence of food insecurity rose sharply from an estimated 11% of U.S. households to an estimated 18-35% of U.S. households. Housing is another important social determinant of health which influences health from birth across the lifespan. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the many ways in which various aspects of housing impact health. More specifically, COVID-19 has increased the risk of housing insecurity for a significant portion of the population. Housing insecurity has also been key in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Transmission has been associated with living in congregate settings and crowded conditions that make it difficult for people to distance when they are sick. People from racial and ethnic minority groups are more likely than Whites to live in crowded conditions (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). The risk of outbreaks has also been high in homeless shelters and long-term care facilities; and racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately represented in these settings (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Additionally, stable housing is a critical part of the response to the pandemic, as it allows individuals who become ill or who are at risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to self-isolate, a major rationale for the national eviction moratorium and other moratoriums at the local and state levels. Local, state, tribal, and federal policies and programs have attempted to blunt the pandemic's effects by addressing key social determinants of health, including food/nutrition insecurity and unstable housing and housing displacements. Early in the pandemic, for example, Congress and the USDA strengthened the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to expand its case load to 6.2 million more participants. The creation of the Pandemic Electronic Benefits Transfer program enabled households with children who relied on free or reduced priced school meals to access extra monetary benefits while schools were in distance learning. Other food/nutrition policies and programs include the following: a) changes in subsidized/free meal programs (e.g., schools); b) parents picking up school meals for children to eat at home; c) additional funding for Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); and d) systems that allow people to enroll in food programs remotely. Unstable housing and housing displacement interventions include the following: a) moratorium on evictions; b) emergency rental assistance and housing; c) elimination of single-family zoning; and d) mortgage relief. These and other local, state, tribal, and federal COVID-19 related food and housing policies and programs, as well as future policies and programs, can be evaluated using a \"natural experiment\" approach to examine their influence on health, health disparities, and health equity. While there have been some cross-sectional studies using modeling and simulation to assess the impact of governmental strategies aimed at lessening the effects of the pandemic, longitudinal studies treating policies and programs as natural experiments can help identify specific causal pathways connecting policies and health. Better understanding of these causal pathways can help elucidate where and when policies and programs will be effective and how they might influence health. Studies could also identify possible unintended consequences of these policies and programs. Studies explicitly addressing how context modifies policy effects and how policies and programs influence health disparities are encouraged. Such research will contribute both to lessons for dealing with future pandemics and for addressing persistent structural factors influencing health equity. Scope and Objectives The research objective is to use a natural experiment approach to examine how food and housing policies and programs (such as those federal actions described at [nutrition.gov](https://www.nutrition.gov) and [hud.gov](https://www.hud.gov)) that aimed to lessen the impact of the pandemic affected health and health equity, to understand the pathways of these effects, and to describe the long-term consequences. This FOA is intended to fund the study of natural experiments where an exposure or change is not directly manipulated by the researcher, and where comparable control data are available and confounding variables can be limited through study design, sample selection, and statistical analysis. Other experimental designs are allowable if the study fits within the scope of the FOA. Rigorous efforts to address potential sources of bias related to causal inference are encouraged and, where appropriate, attention should be paid to advances in the analysis of natural experiments arising in diverse disciplines. Applicants should also account for unintended consequences of policies and programs on health, where applicable. Applicants can propose research that study one or more policies and programs and their combined impacts on child and/or adult health. Examples of topics of interest include, but are not limited to: In addition to the above areas of interest, interests of selected participating Institutes and Centers (ICs) are summarized below. Applicants are encouraged to contact the Scientific/Research contact at the intended IC to ensure that proposed aims of the project are consistent with IC mission and priorities. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) is interested in applications relevant to priorities described in this RFA and that support the NIMH Strategic Plan for Research. This could include (but not be limited to) examinations of the downstream impact of policies and programs designed to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on food and nutrition security (e.g., free school meal programs) and/or housing security/stability strategies (e.g., FEMA's Public Assistance Program for reimbursement of costs associated with housing, eviction moratoriums) on preventive care, engagement with and adherence to mental health treatment, other self-management behaviors, quality of mental health care received, and mental health outcomes (e.g., suicidal behavior, depression, anxiety). NIMH does not support clinical trials in this announcement. To learn more about how NIMH defines clinical trials, please see [https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/funding/opportunities-announcements/clinical-trials-foas). Investigators interested in pursuing clinical trials may wish to consider alternate funding mechanisms such as [PAR-21-129](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-129.html), [ PAR-21-130](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-130.html) or [PAR-21-131](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-21-131.html). NIMH supports non-clinical trials research for this funding announcement, including quasi-experimental studies, survey or qualitative research methods, clinical epidemiology, and development and evaluation of new research methods, measures, financing approaches, or statistical approaches related to mental health services research. NIMH is committed to supporting research that reduces disparities and advances equity in mental health interventions, services, and outcomes. Accordingly, this FOA encourages research studies that seek to reduce disparities for racial and ethnic minority groups, individuals limited by language or cultural barriers, sexual and gender minorities, individuals living in rural areas, socioeconomically disadvantaged persons and other underserved groups. NIMH encourages a deployment-focused model of intervention and services design and evaluation that takes into account the perspective of relevant stakeholders (e.g., service users, providers, administrators, payers) and the key characteristics of the settings (e.g., resources, including workforce capacity; existing clinical workflows) that are intended to implement optimized mental health interventions. This attention to end-user perspectives and characteristics of intended clinical and/or community practice settings is intended to ensure the resultant interventions and service delivery strategies are acceptable to consumers and providers, the approaches are feasible and scalable in the settings where individuals are served, and the research results will have utility for end users. NIMH encourages research on potentially scalable preventive, therapeutic, and services interventions that focuses on practice-relevant questions. Accordingly, collaborations between academic researchers and clinical or community practice partners or networks are encouraged. When possible, studies should capitalize on existing infrastructure (e.g., practice-based research networks such as the NIMH-sponsored Mental Health Research Network (MHRN), electronic medical records, administrative data bases, patient registries, institutions with Clinical and Translational Science Awards) to increase the efficiency of participant recruitment (i.e., more rapid identification and enrollment) and to facilitate the collection of moderator data (e.g., clinical characteristics, biomarkers), longer-term follow-up data, and broader, stakeholder-relevant outcomes (e.g., mental health and general health care utilization, value and efficiency of intervention approaches). Office of Disease Prevention (ODP) The ODP is the lead office at the NIH responsible for assessing, facilitating, and stimulating research in disease prevention. In partnership with the 27 NIH Institutes and Centers, the ODP strives to increase the scope, quality, dissemination, and impact of NIH-supported prevention research. The ODP is interested in providing co-funding support for research that has strong implications for disease prevention and health equity and that include innovative and appropriate design, measurement, and analysis methods. ODP has specific interest in projects that propose evaluation of policy and programmatic actions to address food/nutrition and housing security and the resulting effects on reducing health disparities. The ODP also is interested in applications that propose to study impact of COVID-19 related food and housing mitigation strategies on long-term health effects of COVID-19 (e.g., on risk and severity of chronic conditions, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes and behavioral health outcomes, including depression, anxiety, substance use). Non-responsiveness criteria: Applications will be considered non-responsive to this FOA if the proposed study: Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives Applications must include a Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives (PEDP) submitted as Other Project Information as an attachment (see Section IV; further below). The PEDP will be assessed as part of the scientific and technical peer review evaluation, as well as at the programmatic level with respect to funding decisions.

Applications submitted to the NIH in support of the [NIH mission](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11149) are evaluated for scientific and technical merit through the NIH peer review system. A proposed Clinical Trial application may include study design, methods, and intervention that are not by themselves innovative but address important questions or unmet needs. Additionally, the results of the clinical trial may indicate that further clinical development of the intervention is unwarranted or lead to new avenues of scientific investigation. Reviewers will provide an overall impact score to reflect their assessment of the likelihood for the project to exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field(s) involved, in consideration of the following review criteria and additional review criteria (as applicable for the project proposed). Scored Review Criteria Reviewers will consider each of the review criteria below in the determination of scientific merit, and give a separate score for each. An application does not need to be strong in all categories to be judged likely to have major scientific impact. For example, a project that by its nature is not innovative may be essential to advance a field. Significance Does the project address an important problem or a critical barrier to progress in the field? Is the prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project rigorous? If the aims of the project are achieved, how will scientific knowledge, technical capability, and/or clinical practice be improved? How will successful completion of the aims change the concepts, methods, technologies, treatments, services, or preventative interventions that drive this field? To what extent do the efforts described in the Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives further the significance of the project? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials Are the scientific rationale and need for a clinical trial to test the proposed hypothesis or intervention well supported by preliminary data, clinical and/or preclinical studies, or information in the literature or knowledge of biological mechanisms? For trials focusing on clinical or public health endpoints, is this clinical trial necessary for testing the safety, efficacy or effectiveness of an intervention that could lead to a change in clinical practice, community behaviors or health care policy? For trials focusing on mechanistic, behavioral, physiological, biochemical, or other biomedical endpoints, is this trial needed to advance scientific understanding? Investigator(s) Are the PD(s)/PI(s), collaborators, and other researchers well suited to the project? If Early Stage Investigators or those in the early stages of independent careers, do they have appropriate experience and training? If established, have they demonstrated an ongoing record of accomplishments that have advanced their field(s)? If the project is collaborative or multi-PD/PI, do the investigators have complementary and integrated expertise; are their leadership approach, governance and organizational structure appropriate for the project? To what extent will the efforts described in the Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives strengthen and enhance the expertise required for the project? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials With regard to the proposed leadership for the project, do the PD/PI(s) and key personnel have the expertise, experience, and ability to organize, manage and implement the proposed clinical trial and meet milestones and timelines? Do they have appropriate expertise in study coordination, data management and statistics? For a multicenter trial, is the organizational structure appropriate and does the application identify a core of potential center investigators and staffing for a coordinating center? Innovation Does the application challenge and seek to shift current research or clinical practice paradigms by utilizing novel theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions? Are the concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions novel to one field of research or novel in a broad sense? Is a refinement, improvement, or new application of theoretical concepts, approaches or methodologies, instrumentation, or interventions proposed? To what extent will the efforts described in the Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives meaningfully contribute to innovation? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials Does the design/research plan include innovative elements, as appropriate, that enhance its sensitivity, potential for information or potential to advance scientific knowledge or clinical practice?

Have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? Have the investigators presented adequate plans to address relevant biological variables, such as sex, for studies in vertebrate animals or human subjects? If the project involves human subjects and/or NIH-defined clinical research, are the plans to address 1) the protection of human subjects from research risks, and 2) inclusion (or exclusion) of individuals on the basis of sex/gender, race, and ethnicity, as well as the inclusion or exclusion of individuals of all ages (including children and older adults), justified in terms of the scientific goals and research strategy proposed? Are the timeline and milestones associated with the Plan for Enhancing Diverse Perspectives well-developed and feasible? In addition, for applications involving clinical trials Does the application adequately address the following, if applicable Study Design Is the study design justified and appropriate to address primary and secondary outcome variable(s)/endpoints that will be clear, informative and relevant to the hypothesis being tested? Is the scientific rationale/premise of the study based on previously well-designed preclinical and/or clinical research? Given the methods used to assign participants and deliver interventions, is the study design adequately powered to answer the research question(s), test the proposed hypothesis/hypotheses, and provide interpretable results? Is the trial appropriately designed to conduct the research efficiently? Are the study populations (size, gender, age, demographic group), proposed intervention arms/dose, and duration of the trial, appropriate and well justified? Are potential ethical issues adequately addressed? Is the process for obtaining informed consent or assent appropriate? Is the eligible population available?

A formal notification in the form of a Notice of Award (NoA) will be provided to the applicant organization for successful applications. The NoA signed by the grants management officer is the authorizing document and will be sent via email to the recipient's business official. Recipients must comply with any funding restrictions described in Section IV.5. Funding Restrictions. Selection of an application for award is not an authorization to begin performance. Any costs incurred before receipt of the NoA are at the recipient's risk. These costs may be reimbursed only to the extent considered allowable pre-award costs. Any application awarded in response to this FOA will be subject to terms and conditions found on the [Award Conditions and Information for NIH Grants](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/part_ii_subpart_b.htm) website. This includes any recent legislation and policy applicable to awards that is highlighted on this website. Individual awards are based on the application submitted to, and as approved by, the NIH and are subject to the IC-specific terms and conditions identified in the NoA. ClinicalTrials.gov: If an award provides for one or more clinical trials. By law (Title VIII, Section 801 of Public Law 110-85), the \"responsible party\" must register and submit results information for certain \"applicable clinical trials\" on the ClinicalTrials.gov Protocol Registration and Results System Information Website ( [https://register.clinicaltrials.gov](https://register.clinicaltrials.gov/)). NIH expects registration and results reporting of all trials whether required under the law or not. For more information, see [https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm](https://grants.nih.gov/policy/clinical-trials/reporting/index.htm) Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee Approval: Recipient institutions must ensure that all protocols are reviewed by their IRB or IEC. To help ensure the safety of participants enrolled in NIH-funded studies, the recipient must provide NIH copies of documents related to all major changes in the status of ongoing protocols. Data and Safety Monitoring Requirements: The NIH policy for data and safety monitoring requires oversight and monitoring of all NIH-conducted or -supported human biomedical and behavioral intervention studies (clinical trials) to ensure the safety of participants and the validity and integrity of the data. Further information concerning these requirements is found at [http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm](//grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/hs/data_safety.htm) and in the application instructions (SF424 (R&R) and PHS 398). Investigational New Drug or Investigational Device Exemption Requirements: Consistent with federal regulations, clinical research projects involving the use of investigational therapeutics, vaccines, or other medical interventions (including licensed products and devices for a purpose other than that for which they were licensed) in humans under a research protocol must be performed under a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigational new drug (IND) or investigational device exemption (IDE). 2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements All NIH grant and cooperative agreement awards include the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11120) as part of the NoA. For these terms of award, see the [NIH Grants Policy Statement Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart A: General](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11157) and [Part II: Terms and Conditions of NIH Grant Awards, Subpart B: Terms and Conditions for Specific Types of Grants, Recipients, and Activities](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11159), including of note, but not limited to: If a recipient is successful and receives a Notice of Award, in accepting the award, the recipient agrees that any activities under the award are subject to all provisions currently in effect or implemented during the period of the award, other Department regulations and policies in effect at the time of the award, and applicable statutory provisions. Should the applicant organization successfully compete for an award, recipients of federal financial assistance (FFA) from HHS must administer their programs in compliance with federal civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age and, in some circumstances, religion, conscience, and sex (including gender identify, sexual orientation, and pregnancy). This includes ensuring programs are accessible to persons with limited English proficiency and persons with disabilities. The HHS Office for Civil Rights provides guidance on complying with civil rights laws enforced by HHS. Please see [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-providers/provider-obligations/index.html) and [https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/nondiscrimination/index.html) HHS recognizes that research projects are often limited in scope for many reasons that are nondiscriminatory, such as the principal investigator's scientific interest, funding limitations, recruitment requirements, and other considerations. Thus, criteria in research protocols that target or exclude certain populations are warranted where nondiscriminatory justifications establish that such criteria are appropriate with respect to the health or safety of the subjects, the scientific study design, or the purpose of the research. For additional guidance regarding how the provisions apply to NIH grant programs, please contact the Scientific/Research Contact that is identified in Section VII under Agency Contacts of this FOA. Please contact the HHS Office for Civil Rights for more information about obligations and prohibitions under federal civil rights laws at [https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/ocr/about-us/contact-us/index.html) or call 1-800-368-1019 or TDD 1-800-537-7697. In accordance with the statutory provisions contained in Section 872 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417), NIH awards will be subject to the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) requirements. FAPIIS requires Federal award making officials to review and consider information about an applicant in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS) prior to making an award. An applicant, at its option, may review information in the designated integrity and performance systems accessible through FAPIIS and comment on any information about itself that a Federal agency previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. The Federal awarding agency will consider any comments by the applicant, in addition to other information in FAPIIS, in making a judgement about the applicant's integrity, business ethics, and record of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by applicants as described in 45 CFR Part 75.205 and 2 CFR Part 200.206 \"Federal awarding agency review of risk posed by applicants.\" This provision will apply to all NIH grants and cooperative agreements except fellowships. Not Applicable 3. Reporting When multiple years are involved, recipients will be required to submit the [Research Performance Progress Report (RPPR)](//grants.nih.gov/grants/rppr/index.htm) annually and financial statements as required in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement.](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_8/8.4.1_reporting.htm) A final RPPR, invention statement, and the expenditure data portion of the Federal Financial Report are required for closeout of an award, as described in the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/nihgps/HTML5/section_8/8.6_closeout.htm). NIH FOAs outline intended research goals and objectives. Post award, NIH will review and measure performance based on the details and outcomes that are shared within the RPPR, as described at 45 CFR Part 75.301 and 2 CFR Part 200.301. The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006 (Transparency Act), includes a requirement for recipients of Federal grants to report information about first-tier subawards and executive compensation under Federal assistance awards issued in FY2011 or later. All recipients of applicable NIH grants and cooperative agreements are required to report to the Federal Subaward Reporting System (FSRS) available at [www.fsrs.gov](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11170) on all subawards over $25,000. See the [NIH Grants Policy Statement](//grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/url_redirect.htm?id=11171) for additional information on this reporting requirement. In accordance with the regulatory requirements provided at 45 CFR 75.113 and Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75, recipients that have currently active Federal grants, cooperative agreements, and procurement contracts from all Federal awarding agencies with a cumulative total value greater than $10,000,000 for any period of time during the period of performance of a Federal award, must report and maintain the currency of information reported in the System for Award Management (SAM) about civil, criminal, and administrative proceedings in connection with the award or performance of a Federal award that reached final disposition within the most recent five-year period. The recipient must also make semiannual disclosures regarding such proceedings. Proceedings information will be made publicly available in the designated integrity and performance system (currently FAPIIS). This is a statutory requirement under section 872 of Public Law 110-417, as amended (41 U.S.C. 2313). As required by section 3010 of Public Law 111-212, all information posted in the designated integrity and performance system on or after April 15, 2011, except past performance reviews required for Federal procurement contracts, will be publicly available. Full reporting requirements and procedures are found in Appendix XII to 45 CFR Part 75 - Award Term and Conditions for Recipient Integrity and Performance Matters.
