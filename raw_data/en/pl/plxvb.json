But you can help to stay safe by following advice such as getting vaccinated, regular handwashing, and good ventilation. Having other health conditions like diabetes or heart disease can also affect your risk. If you are not sure what you should do, speak to your pharmacist, stroke nurse or GP. If you have a condition that reduces your immunity, you should follow the advice on keeping safe that you were given before the pandemic. - You can find information and support for a [range of health conditions and coronavirus](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/other-conditions-and-coronavirus/). You can find general advice about coronavirus online: Help with symptoms You don't need to contact 111 if you have symptoms. But you should use the [NHS online 111 service](https://111.nhs.uk/covid-19) if: - You feel you cannot cope with your symptoms at home. - Your condition gets worse. - Your symptoms do not get better after seven days. Call 111 if you can't use the online service. Stroke symptoms and Covid-19 If you or someone you know has stroke symptoms, call 999. Even if you have Covid-19, you will be taken to hospital and given emergency treatment. You can read more about the [FAST test](https://www.stroke.org.uk/what-is-stroke/what-are-the-symptoms-of-stroke) for stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA or mini-stroke). Attending medical appointments Stroke risk and vaccines Can Covid-19 increase my risk of a stroke? Covid-19 gives you a 20 times higher risk of a stroke in the first few weeks after having Covid-19. Your risk stays slightly high for about a year after infection. This was discovered through research funded by the Stroke Association. You can read an [article about this research](https://www.stroke.org.uk/stroke-news/stroke-and-covid-19-research-update). Can vaccines for Covid-19 cause a stroke? The vaccine produced by Astra-Zeneca led to a small number of cases of a rare condition that causes severe blood clots in the brain in 2021. This vaccine is no longer available in the UK, and the vaccines now in use do not cause this blood-clotting condition. We do get calls from people who had their stroke soon after the vaccine, and are worried that the vaccine was the cause. It's not always possible to identify the exact cause of a stroke. Things like high blood pressure, heart conditions and high cholesterol can raise your risk, and stroke is much more common in older people. Doctors try to find your risk factors, but up to one third of the most common type of stroke don't have an obvious cause. A stroke can happen at any time of the day or night. It can happen while you are sleeping, at work, at home or outdoors. Because millions of people across the UK have the vaccine, it makes it more likely that some will have their strokes in the days or weeks after a vaccination. If you have had a stroke or blood clot soon after a vaccine and you think it was a side-effect of the vaccine, you can report to the [Yellow Card Scheme](https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/) which monitors side effects of all the drugs in the UK. You can also get individual advice about vaccines and stroke from your stroke team or GP. What are the benefits of being vaccinated? Covid-19 can give you a 20 times higher risk of a stroke soon after infection. Having a vaccination can reduce your risk of getting infected, which helps you to avoid a post-Covid stroke. And being vaccinated reduces your overall risk of a stroke, with people aged over 70 being 25% less likely to have a stroke. Should I have the vaccine if I've recently had a stroke? Soon after a stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA or mini-stroke), you have a much higher risk of having another stroke. On top of that, our research shows that having Covid-19 also increases your risk of a stroke. By getting a vaccination, you can reduce your risk of having a post-Covid stroke. So we are encouraging everyone affected by stroke or at risk of stroke to have the vaccinations they are offered. Ask your GP or pharmacist for individual advice if you have any questions about your health or treatment. Should I get the coronavirus booster and flu vaccines at the same time? Yes, it's perfectly ok to get the coronavirus booster and your flu vaccines at the same time. These come as two separate vaccines and you might not get them both in the same arm. So, if you've got one-sided weakness or an atrophied muscle in one of your arms, you should speak to your GP about where to have your vaccines. They might suggest having them at different times, or having one of them in your leg, which some people prefer. Are the vaccines and booster safe for stroke survivors who are taking medication, such as blood thinners and statins? Yes, you can normally have a covid jab while you are on medication. Some things to think about include: - If you need a shingles vaccination, it's best to keep this seven days apart from a covid jab. - If you are on blood-thinning medication, you can ask your GP or consultant if you have a risk of bleeding or bruising at the injection point. Most people can still have the jab if their condition is stable. - You may need specialist advice if you are on high doses of steroids or immunosuppressed, or recently had chemotherapy or radiotherapy. For any questions about medications and the vaccine, you can talk to your GP or pharmacist. You can also check with the clinician giving you the vaccine.
