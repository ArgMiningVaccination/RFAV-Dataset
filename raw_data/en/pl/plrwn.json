What Spikevax bivalent Original / Omicron is and what it is used for Spikevax bivalent Original / Omicron is a vaccine used to prevent COVID -19 disease caused by SARS - CoV -2. It is given to adults aged 18 years and older. The active substance in Spikevax bivalent Original / Omicron is mRNA encoding the SARS -CoV -2 Spike protein. embedded lipid nanoparticles. Spikevax bivalent Original / Omicro n two different messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA), elasomeran and imelasomeran. Elasomeran encodes the spike protein of the original strain of the virus whereas imelasomeran encodes the spike protein of the Omicron BA.1 variant of the vir us. The original Spikevax vaccine contains elasomeran only. As Spikevax does not contain the virus, it cannot give you COVID -19. How the vaccine works Spikevax bivalent Original / Omicron stimulates the body's natural defences (immune system). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce protection (antibodies) against the virus that causes COVID -19. Spikevax bivalent Original / Omicron uses a substance called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to carry instructions that ce lls in the body can use to make the spike protein that is also on the virus. The cells then make antibodies against the spike protein to help fight off the virus. This will help to protect you against COVID -19. 2. What you need to know before you are given Spikevax bivalent Original / Omicron The vaccine must not be given if 2 - you are allergic to the active substance or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).
