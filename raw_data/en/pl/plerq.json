Sincerely, THE MLS FACUL TY Professor Dorilyn Hitchcock, Program Director Dr. Kyle Riding Professor Greg Weigel Dr. Jose(Alex) Alexander Kathleen Janda - laboratory specialist University of Central Florida Overview The University of Central Florida, a member institution of the State University System, was formerly Florida Technological University. The name was changed by action of the Florida Legislature on December 6, 1978. The University is the second largest university based on numbers of students. With more than 64,000 students, UCF is the largest university by enrollment in Florida and one of the largest universities in the nation. It has more than 12,000 employees and an operating budget of $1.5 billion . University Goals The University of Central Florida 5 goals as described by President Hitt: 1. Offer the best undergraduate education available in Florida 2. Achieve intern ational prominence in key programs of graduate study and research 3. Provide international focus to our curricula and research programs 4. Become more inclusive and diverse 5. Be America's leading partnership university The MLS program directly meets goals 1,4, an d 5 through its emphasis on high -quality undergraduate education that helps the diverse population of Central Florida obtain gainful employment at affiliated hospitals and medical centers within the area and at similar facilities across the nation. The Bu rnett School of Biomedical Sciences The Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences was established in 2007 as a part of the College of Medicine. Programs leading to Bachelor of Science degrees in the School include Medical Laboratory Sciences, Biomedical Scien ces, and Biotechnology . All undergraduate programs are housed at main campus of UCF. Graduate programs in BSBS include: PhD Biomedical Sciences MD-PhD Biomedical Sciences MS Biomedical Sciences (non -thesis) o MS Cancer Biology Track o MS Infectious Disease Track o MS Metabolic and Car diovascular Sciences Track o MS Neuroscience Track MS Biotechnology o MS Biotechnology thesis o Professional Science Master's non -thesis (PS M) Track As a medical laboratory scientist , you may apply for any of these graduate programs. The Medical Laboratory Science Program Overview The Medical Technology Program was appr oved by the Board of Regents of the State of Florida in 1968 as a Bachelor of Science degree -granting program. The name of the program was changed to Medical Laboratory Sciences in 1984. The Medical Laboratory Sciences Program began as a traditional 3 + 1 hospital -based program. In order to best serve the UCF student, accreditation for a University -based program was sought. Accreditation by the \"Committee on Allied Health Education Accreditation\" (CAHEA) in conjunction with the \"National Accrediting Age ncy for Clinical Laboratory Sciences\" (NAACLS) was achieved in 1982. NAACLS (5600 N. River Road, Suite 720 , Rosemont, IL 60018 -5119 ) is the current agency accrediting the program. The program is fully accredited until 20 20. In the current University -based program, students accepted into the upper division will receive intense didactic and laboratory experiences within medical laboratory courses on campus in the Fall, Spring and Summer semesters of the junior year. If all the courses are sa tisfactorily completed during this time, the student will be assigned a clinical experience registering for clinical courses during the Fall semester of his/her senior year. The clinical experience is in its entirety during this fall semester at a clinica l facility assigned to the student by the program . The student will n ot be on campus during the clinical experience . Upon completion of the Fall semester of the senior year, the student will return to campus during the spring semester of the senior year to complete the program coursework. The degree in Medical Laboratory Sciences will be awarded upon satisfactory com pletion of all components of the curriculum . Accreditation Statement The UCF Medical Laboratory Science Program is accredited by the Nati onal Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Science. You may contact NAACLS for more information on the web at: www.naccls.org or at 5600 N. River Road Suite 720, Rosemont, IL, 60018 -2119. Telephone: 847.939.3597.

Students must meet requirements of the Gordon Rule and take the CLAST test. Students must meet the foreign language requirement an d any other State, University, or College requirements. See specific information in University catalog. An audit is maintained on every student in the Program Office. It is the student's obligation and responsibility to review his/her file periodically w ith the program director in order to check on requirements and progress through the program. EEO Policies Qualified applicants are admitted to the Medical Laboratory Sciences Program without discrimination in regard to age, creed, ethnic origin, marital s tatus, race or sex. The University of Central Florida is an equal opportunity/affirmative action employer, and assures equal access to educational programs and activity opportunities without regard to race, sex, age, handicap or national origin. Grievance /Appeal On campus The student should first bring the complaint to the attention of the Program Director if the problem cannot be resolved at professor level. Open communication is encouraged so that resorting to a formal written grievance will not be nece ssary unless the situation requires it . If there is no resolution at this level, the student may bring the complaint next to the attention of the Associate Director of the Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences. If there is still no resolution, the studen t may then bring the complaint to the Director of the Burnett School of Biomedical Sciences. A formal resolution of grievance may be continued through the grievance process. If the student wants to make a formal written complaint, the student must follow the procedure outlines in the GOLDEN RULE, A HANDBOOK FOR STUDENTS regarding University rules and regulations. This can be found at http://goldenrule.sdes.ucf.edu While at the Clinical Affiliates The studen t should first bring the complaint to the attention of the designated clinical coordinator at the clinical site. If the complaint cannot be resolved at that level, the student brings it to the MLS program director's attention. The program director will m ake the recommendations to the clinical coordinator for changes. If the student is not satisfied with the outcome, can then make a formal complaint to the Associate Director of BSBS, then the Director, and if necessary the student can file a formal grieva nce through SDES (Student Development and Enrollment Services). Advisement The MLS Program Director is available to assist students for registration during regular office hours. You will be given access to registration every semester as determined by the Program Director to ensure enrollment in the MLS classes. The Program Director will keep updated audits and will inform students of any changes or requirements that need to be addressed. All printed advising materials containing personal information w ill be stored in a FERPA -compliant manner within the Burnett School of Biomedical Science Administrative office. MLS faculty are available to assist with course objectives with their office hours posted on faculty office doors each semester. Please mak e appointments with faculty during these hours. If the need arises, the faculty will make every effort to accommodate students outside the posted office hours. Students will have the opportunity to evaluate each faculty member at the end of every semes ter. This is highly encouraged to provide constructive feedback to MLS faculty as to their delivery of material and the students' ability to retain it. Attendance As a general rule, please note course policies on attendance within each of your courses. Instructors reserve the right to set and enforce these policies at their discretion. The following are general policies to keep in mind throughout the program. Absences -- Lecture It is the responsibility of the student to obtain information and assignment s from faculty or other students in the class. Lecture is a vital component for success in the MLS program. Absences are considered a negative attribute and references from faculty will reflect against the student. The program is considered a profession al program and the student will be assess ed in accordance with professional standards of the medical laboratory industry . UNEXCUSED ABSENCES are strongly discouraged and the student should not expect the faculty to help with material that has been missed . Three unexcused absences during an MLS course is considered a sever e enough offense that disciplinary action can be sought, including dismiss al from the program . Absences on test days are considered unexcused absences. In extenuating circumstances, the student may petition the program faculty to be allowed to make up the exam but such exceptions are at the discretion of the faculty . Absences -- Laboratory Sessions Clinical specimens, reagents, and supplies used for laboratory exercises have a shor t usable life. Because of these constraints and the expense involved, NO make -up sessions will be held in the laboratory by the faculty. With faculty permission and availability of specimens and reagents, the student may be able to perform laboratory pro cedures missed. If, due to constraints, the lab session(s) cannot be made up, a grade of zero (0) will be given for the missed lab. However, the student will be responsible for information that would be gained from the performance and write -up of each ex ercise. Absences in assigned clinical rotations are considered unexcused and will result in dismissal from the program if excessive. Tardiness Punctuality is the mark of a professional. Tardiness causes class disruption and if excesses occur, faculty may lock classroom doors at the beginning of class. The student will be graded on punctuality critically during the clinical practicums. Therefore , it is important that good attendance habits are developed. Your future positions will require it. MLS G rading Policies Grading Policies for the MLS Program are those approved by the faculty of the Program as a whole. The +/ - grading system will be dependent on faculty. The Policies are as follows: NUMERICAL AVERAGE LETTER 90 - 100 A 80 - 89 B 70 - 79 C ______________________________________________ UNSATISFACTORY GRADES 60 - 69 D 68 - 0 F Academic Performance A minimum grade point average of 2.5 and minimum grade of C in the major course s and in prerequisite science courses is required for admission to, and continuation in the Medical Laboratory Sciences Program. NO student may graduate with an MLS degree with a grade point average below 2.5. The laboratory portion of each course must b e passed with a minimum of a \"C\" or better or the student will receive a failing grade for that course. Students not meeting the Essential Functions can also be academically dismissed due to their inability to meet specific program requirements. The MLS f aculty will evaluate and meet with each student mid year of the first year in the program to determine eligibility to continue. Students not meeting professional standards, or weak students may be asked to choose another major or retake MLS classes. This is at the discretion of the MLS faculty. Laboratory Performance If the student cannot perform up to expected standards in the laboratory sessions, the student will be counseled to consider an alternative major. Academic Integrity Since this is considere d a professional program the expectations of the student's behavior is critically evaluated. A student cheating on an exam or laboratory exercise does not exhibit behavior that would be conducive to handling patient data in a clinical setting. IF a stude nt is caught cheating, copying or turning in any form of work that is not his/her own, there will be immediate action taken that will result in dismissal from the program. Responsibilities o f The Student Social Security Number All MLS students MUST possess a social security number in order to get a Florida State trainees license. The MLS student MUST have the ability to relocate or have transportation to and from clinical affiliates for their clinical rotations. Medical/Health Insurance Coverage Every student MUST have proof of medical insurance before attending clinicals. Liability Insurance Each Health Program subscribes to the liability insurance program provided by the State University System administered through the College of Health and Publ ic Affairs; each program pays the required fee for each student enrolled in the upper division phase of the program. Health Status Reports Every student must submit the following health information to the program so it may be kept on hand and filed with student records. This material is required by clinical affiliates to sure your health is good enough to work within a clinical setting per their occupational health requirements. The minimum requirements are: 1. A statement of good health from a licensed phy sician or physician extender. 2. Results of a tuberculin skin test or serum -based tuberculosis assay that demonstrate the student is not infected with tuberculosis. 3. A nine panel drug screen Due to the nature of the samples obtained from clinical facilities, the faculty of the MLS program HIGHLY ENCOURAGE the Hep B vaccine. It is obtainable through the Student Health Center for a nominal cost. It is a series of three doses -the second and third at 1 and 6 months after the first. If you chose NOT to receive the vaccination, you will be required to sign a declination form and will waive any liability. Other documents and records (particularly vaccinations) may be needed at the request of the clinical affiliate. The student must provide all requested document s to be eligible to attend the clinical affiliate for their practicum experience. Clinical affiliates reserve the right to refuse a student who does not comply with the health policies. Background Check You will be required to obtain an OFFICIAL backgrou nd check. We utilize Castlebranch. This must be done before starting the clinical rotations and/or the start of the program. Dress Code Students are expected to purchase a laboratory coat for the first day of class. The lab coat will stay in the MLS lab until the student attends clinical affiliates . Closed -toed shoes and long pants will be worn in the MLS lab at all times. Students are expected to purchase scrubs with the UCF logo and Medical Laboratory Sciences embroidered on the shirts. The standard scrub color is blacktops with black pants. Estimated cost is $25/scrub set. Clinical Experience Clinical Affiliates Program matic accreditation through NAACLS requires that a signed affiliation agreement be in effect for each clinical site that participates in clinical training of Medical Laboratory Science Program student s. A copy of the agreements and each addendum are available in the Medical Laboratory Science office for student to review, if desired. An important component of the agreement s follows and outlines the student's responsibilities at the clinical facility Student Responsibilities WHILE AT THE CLINICAL FACILITY, THE STUDENT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE AS FOLLOWS: 1. for following the administrative policies, standards, and practices of t he facility. 2. for providing the necessary and appropriate uniforms required but not provided by the facility, 3. for his or her own transportation and living arrangements when not provided by the facility, 4. for reporting to the facility on time and following al l established regulations during the regularly scheduled operating hours of the facility 5. for conforming to the standards and practices established by the university while training in the facility; and for obtaining prior written approval of the facility an d the university before publishing any material relating to clinical education experience. PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT A. Students are expected to act in a professional manner at all times while in the clinical facility, in both speech and action. B. Affective (profess ional) objectives: students are expected to strive for excellence in ratings for these objectives. C. Students will find that Clinical Affiliate policies may differ slightly. The student must respect and adhere to the rules and customs of each clinical affiliate during his/her clinical assignment at the facility. For specific policies of the affiliate, t he student must refer to the material provided during the orientation to the Affiliate Laboratory. D. The student will seldom, if ever, be called upon for emergency service, but your clinical instructor may be; therefore, the student must remember that such a call is related to patient care and takes precedence over all other duties, including teaching, for the laboratory staff. (The student, if a situation arises, should discuss such a service with the University Clinical Education Coordinator.) E. Problems enc ountered by the student while at the clinical affiliate should be brought to the immediate attention of the Clinical Laboratory Education Coordinator. Problems in patient preparation; criticism of personnel in other departments; unusual responses of the p atient (incontinent, agitated, nauseated, or any accident involving patients); any situation involving nursing personnel and other incidents should be reported to the Clinical Instructor and the Clinical Education Coordinator and/or Laboratory Administrato r. The student should discuss the problem/occurrence with the UCF faculty during the faculty on - site visit. However, if the problem cannot be resolved OR if the problem can not wait until the next scheduled visit of the UCF faculty, the student should cal l the MLS Program Office: Phone (407) 823 -5932; or the Program Director's Office (407) 823 -5220. At no time should students discuss incidents outside the confines of the Laboratory Education Coordinator's Office. Students MUST NOT discuss patient res ults outside of the laboratory...CONFIDENTIALITY of PATIENT'S RESULTS must be strictly guarded....MEDICAL ETHICS MUST BE OBSERVED AT ALL TIMES. Do not casually discuss test results in the hallways of the laboratory, in elevators, dining rooms or outside t he hospital Assignment To Clinical Affiliate For Clinical Experience Assignment to the clinical affiliates will be made with the purpose of providing the students with unbiased assignments that benefit the student's educational experience as best as possible . Please note that you may be required to relocate during this time. The following facilities are affiliated with the MLS program: Central Florida Regional Medical Center Flager Hospital Health Central Nemours Children's Hospital Orlando One Blood, Inc. South Lake Hospital VA Hospital Gainesville VA Hospital Orlando Florida Hospital Waterman Orlando Health Watson Clinic Florida Hospital Tampa Florida Hospital Orlando (eight campuses in total) Osceola Regional Medical Center If there is an unexpected change in clinical seat capacity and more students than available seats , UCF MLS students will be ranked by professional phase course GPA to de termine who has priority in placement . Those wi th higher GPA's in the professional phase courses will be placed first. Those students not attending clinical rotations on time will be allowed to take courses in the curriculum normally taken after the clinical rotations and a placement will be provided as soon as available . Clinical Rotation Schedule Information pertinent to the Clinical assignment such as the days, hours and rotation schedule will be provided before the start of the clinical rotations by the assigned clinical affiliate. The clinical affiliate you are assigned to for the clinical experi ence courses will have varying hours. However, you should plan on a 40 hour class time per week. The hours may VARY, i.e.: 7:00 am - 3:30 PM 6:00 am - 2:30 PM 8:00 am - 4:30 PM The s tudent may be asked to train on an afternoon (evening) or night shift to gain experience in the work load. There will b e advance notice. Attendance During The Clinical Rotation The relationship between the Clinical facility and UCF depends to a large deg ree on the professionalism of the MLS students. Students should keep in mind that they are \"guests\" at the clinical site. Students who are chronically late or absent will not be allowed to continue in the program or be readmitted at another time. Proble ms with professional conduct such as absences will be addressed by the UCF Program Director with the student. If the situation is not corrected, the student will not be allowed to continue in the program. Clinical Service Work Policy The clinical affilia tes have the option to employ the student in non -class time hours in support personnel positions. The employment is between the clinical affiliate and the student. THE STUDENT IS NOT TO PERFORM ANY SERVICE WORK DURING CLINICAL TRAINING! THE STUDENT SHOULD NOTIFY THE PROGRAM DIRECTOR IMMEDIATELY IF ASKED TO DO SO. Clinical Evaluation Clinical performance will be evaluated using an instrument developed by the UCF f aculty and the affiliate instructors; and approved by the Program Director. An updated copy of the clinical performance evaluation forms will be given to each student at the beginning of the clinical experience courses. Final evaluation will be discussed w ith each student at the end of each clinical rotation. Final grades are assigned by the UCF faculty after reviewing with the Clinical Instructor. The student should discuss the final grade assigned with the UCF Clinical Education Coordinator. Graduation from the Program Graduation from the program requires successful completion of all MLS courses, adherence to MLS program rules, and successful completion of the MLS Comprehensive Exam. Comprehensive Exam Upon completion of all course work, the senior stud ent is required to take a \"COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION\" which will be the major grade component of MLS 4933 Senior Seminar. The examination is a three hour exam consisting of 200 + multiple choice questions. Passing criteria constitutes a score of 60% or bet ter. The student has two attempts to pass the exam. A failing grade on this exam will result in a failed grade for the Senior Seminar course and hence the student will no longer be eligible to graduate. The student will then have to retake the exam at a later date based on the score to determine the eligibility date of graduation. Results of the exam and an analysis by the UCF faculty will be discussed with each student after completion to use as a guide to assist the student in preparation for the nationa l certification examination and hence State licensure. ASCP Board of Certification Exam As a graduate of a NAACLS accredited program, successful completion of the UCF MLS program allows you to sit for the ASCPS Board of Certification MLS Exam. Please note that sitting for the ASCP Board of Certification exam is highly encouraged and national certification is requirement for Florida licensure. However, graduation from the program is not dependent upon the certification exam . Important Reminders Deadlines: Spring/Summer Term - Junior Year 1. \"Trainee License Application\" forms. The latest form can be obtained from DOH web site. You will need a copy of your latest transcript attached to the form.

Join a professional organization and be active Remember, you are the future of the profession! Laboratory Safety Infection Control Universal Precautions A policy standardizing the handling of biological hazards. The concept of universal precautions was first introduced in 1 987 by CDC to decrease the occupational risks to blood -borne diseases. In 1991 OSHA issued their final standard on occupational exposure to blood -borne pathogens, which mandates the use of universal precautions for protection against blood -borne pathogens . This standard mandates that each laboratory must develop an exposure control plan to include engineering controls, safe work practices, the use of protective equipment, proper waste handling and hepatitis B vaccinations. In essence treating EVERY SAMPL E as if it is infectious. Hand -washing Hand -washing is the #1 defense in the spread of infection. Gloves do NOT replace handwashing. Adequate handwashing requires soap, running water and least 30 seconds of friction. Handwashing before leaving the labor atory is the expected standard and faculty have the right to incorporate grading practice that mark down students grades for not following this essential practice. Personal Protective Equipment Gloves , Lab coats, and other session -required personal protec tive equipment (PPE) are a REQUIREMENT in any of the MLS laboratories . Failure to use PPE will result in you being asked to leave the laboratory. Federal Regulations \"Rules, standards, and regulations set forth by Federal, State, and Local government agen cies and professional organizations demand, as far as possible, safe and healthful working conditions in hospital laboratory...the use of safe laboratory procedures is not just a sensible goal, it is the law.\" It is the responsibility of the laboratory s taff to remain informed and in compliance with the law at all times. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) of 1970 created two agencies: National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) o One of eight operating components of the Centers For Disease Control (CDC) which is a health agency in the Department of Health and Human Services. o Does not regulate, issue, or enforce safety or health standards. o Primarily engages in research to eliminate health and safety hazards of American workers. Occupational Safety a nd Health Administration (OSHA)* *NOTE: That OSHA may be used to refer to either Occupational Safety and Health Administration OR the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. o Promulgates and enforces safety and health standards and regulations in the workplace. o Conducts workplace investigations and inspections to determine the status of compliance with job safety and health standards. Issues citations and proposes penalties. o OSHA Standards o Divided into four (4) major categories: 1. general industry 2. maritime 3. construction 4. agriculture o Clinical, chemical and analytic laboratories are subject to the relevant standards found within OSHA General Industry Standards and Interpretations, Volume I, Part 1910, Title 29, Code of Federal Regulations. OSHA 29 CFR 1910 -- available as OSHA Publication 2206. Hazardous Materials Safety Data Sheets Information on toxic substances in your work area and can be found in t he safety data sheets (SDS), provided by the product manufacturer SDS Information Shee ts o identifies the product/agent o lists the hazardous chemicals o lists the physical characteristics o gives fire and explosion data o contains health hazard information o gives reactivity data o lists spill or leak procedures o indicates if special protection is needed o indicates medical precautions o exposure control o disposal guidelines o regulatory information and considerations Spill Response: What to do in the event of a hazardous spill: o do not touch o keep people away, evacuate the area o contain spill if small o stop leak if you can do it without risk o refer to MSDS for appropriate cleanup aid o notify instructor IMMEDIATELY Contaminated Needle Stick Injury Infectious diseases such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis B may be transmitted via blood and/or other body fluids. Consequently, a needle stick injury from a contaminated needle poses potential exposure to these diseases. Therefore, UCF students, faculty members, or staff members of the College who are likely to be exposed to needles in the course of car rying out their academic and educational programs need to be taught the proper care and handling of needles. Should an injury occur from a contaminated or potentially contaminated needle, the following procedures are recommended: Known Source 1. Refer person who was stuck (victim) to their supervisor or medical authorities at the facility and/or refer to University Health Service where the accident occurred for immediate care. Wound must be cleansed thoroughly. (Student must carry health care insurance .). If on campus, notify your instructor immediately. If at clinical affiliate notify the clinical education coordinator and your program director immediately. 2. Assess the person who had been previously stuck if possible for potential risk. 3. Hepatitis profil e should be drawn on client (cost to be paid by person accidently stuck unless it is the policy of the facility at which the incident occurred to cover such accidents). Permission must be obtained from client and client's physician, if involved in a health care agency. 4. Tetanus booster as needed. 5. HIV test performed and repeated at 3 -, 6-, and 9 -month intervals. 6. Administer hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) treatment after above stat blood tests, if indicated. 7. Hepatitis B vaccine should be started, after abov e blood stat tests, if indicated. 8. An incident report must be completed and placed on file (Worker's compensation form for University employees) This report will be on file in the Student Health Center. Unknown Source 1. Refer person stuck (victim) to their supervisor or medical authorities at the facility where the accident occurred for immediate care. Wound must be cleansed thoroughly. 2. Perform HIV test stat and repeated at 3 -, 6-, and 9 -month intervals. 3. If deemed by medical director, proceed with serology test for syphilis and repeat in 3 months. 4. Proceed with hepatitis profile stat. 5. Administer tetanus booster after above stat blood tests (if 5 years since last booster). 6. Administer HBIG treatment after above stat blood tests. 7. Administer Hepatitis B vaccine after above stat blood tests. 8. An incident report must be completed and placed on file. MLS Student Laboratory Safety Procedures and Policies Students are expected to observe the following in the laboratory at all times even if laboratory sessions are not occurring: 1. No eating, drinking, application of cosmetics, or smoking in the laboratory. 2. No food is to be stored in the reagent/specimen refrigerators/freezers. 3. Do not ever use the ice from these refrigerators for drinks. 4. Appropriate PPE will be used at all times shall be worn at all times and left in the lab when leaving. The only exception to this is when a lecture is occurring in the laboratory space and no hazardous substances are being used. 5. Long, untied hair, loose flowing clothing, sandals, neckties, or jewelry that presents hazards must be removed. Certain religious exceptions will be made as needed. 6. SPILLS must be handled immediately using the spill response procedure above 7. Do not distract or startle another individual or indulge in practical horsepl ay in the laboratory. 8. Wash hands frequently, especially after handling contaminated material and before leaving the lab oratory, with an antiseptic soap . 9. Tidiness, cleanliness and good housekeeping are required at all work areas. A mess is a safety hazard. 10. Unlab eled materials must not be used and will be discarded if found. 11. Do not take shortcuts or take chances with procedures, materials, or equipment. Reporting fabricated results is an act of academic dishonesty. 12. Adhere to Waste -Disposal procedures. All co ntaminated waste, including specimens and inoculated materials, must be disposed in the appropriate containers. 13. When in doubt about any procedure or conditions, ASK AN INSTRUCTOR before proceeding. 14. Handle all specimens as if they are contaminated. 15. Avoid pu tting fingers, pencils, or other objects into the mouth. 16. Needles and syringes must be discarded into proper containers. 17. Laboratory work surface should be decontaminated with a disinfectant following any spill AND at the start and completion of the laborato ry session.
