But it's also inconvenient, requiring hours of clinic time and needles. Enter IVtoGo: a natural, high dose vitamin C drip that delivers powerful IV vitamin C therapy conveniently...anytime and anywhere. - Convenient IVtoGo has IV power but is totally portable. Travel time, appointments, and lengthy drip treatments are unneeded. - IV-Equivalent Formulated by leading biochemists, IVtoGo liposomes are highly absorbed and reach tissues that IV vitamins can't. All nutrients included in correct proportions to replicate true IV therapy. - Economical Each IVtoGo provides three IV-equivalent therapies. Priced like a single IV, you save hundreds when compared with traditional IV therapies. - Clean 100% non-GMO, non-soy, non-China, and utrapure water (exceeding pharmaceutical grade). Made in the USA at CGMP-certified facilities dedicated exclusively to liposomes. Easy Dose It IVtoGo tastes great and removes the barrier between busy schedules and truly effective vitamin therapy. Five tablespoons (75 mL) taken throughout a day provides equivalent absorption to a 25 Gram IV vitamin C. Feel Better Or Send it Back IVtoGo has clinical power that works - and none of the side effects of IV - but it also tends to simply make people feel better. If within an hour of your first protocol you don't feel better than after IV, return the bottle for a full refund. C-Max: Cancer-Specific C-Max improves both the potency and convenience of high-dose vitamin C cancer therapy. Studies show that, in comparison with high-dose vitamin C alone, the complimentary nature of these vitamins greatly enhances chemotherapeutic effect. Specifically, the dose of vitamin C required to kill cancer cells is reduced by a factor of 10-50. For this reason, therapeutic effect is observed at relatively low plasma concentrations, obtainable by oral administration. Further, studies indicate that CK3 offers therapeutic benefits beyond the direct degradation of cancer cells. These include enhancement of immune response to tumor cells (CK3 makes cancer recognizable to the immune system); and synergistic effects with conventional chemo- and radiotherapy. The Best Cancer Science CK3 therapy is cytotoxic to cancer cells, but it's far more so when administered over extended timeframes, wherein cancer cells are exposed to vitamins C and K3 for longer durations. Compared to traditional IV and oral vitamin C, which has a half-life of 30 minutes, C-Max liposomes last much longer in the body, exposing cancer to the continuous breakdown. C-Max can be also be taken throughout the day and seven days a week. This greatly improves overall exposure time, accelerating cancer cell death - all while leaving normal cells completely intact. Learn More IVtoGo is a tasty, portable liposomal version of high-dose Vitamin C IV treatment. It combines liposomal Vitamin C with Glutathione and B Vitamins in a convenient oral supplement that can be taken anywhere. All supplements are appropriately proportioned to one another, which simplifies dosing for the consumer. The full dosing regimen provides the bioequivalent dose of a 25 g IVC; smaller doses can be taken for health maintenance. Liposomes facilitate uptake and distribution of their payload (contents) throughout the body via lymphatic delivery to blood circulation, and permit deep intra-cellular access to mitochondria, endoplasmic reticula, and nuclei. By way of these mechanisms of absorption, 95%+ of IVtoGo's supplements are utilized by the body. (It is surmised that intravenous Vitamin C is 15% absorbed; 85% is discarded in the urine.) IVtoGo is thus able to provide the effective dose of a 25g Vitamin C IV dose in five oral doses, which are taken throughout the day. Note that unlike intravenous Vitamin C and Glutathione, negligible bodily energy is consumed in nutrient conversion/reduction of liposomal supplements, which is a benefit to those who are already fatigued due to illness or stress. IVtoGo uses a proprietary dosing algorithm based on peer-reviewed studies of the absorption rates of the payload supplements when administered in liposomal as opposed to intravenous forms. Suggested Use: For IV-equivalence, take one dose (1 tbsp.) every 2-4 hours until 5 doses have been taken. For health maintenance take 1-3 doses/day. As with all dietary supplements, consult your healthcare provider prior to use. Pregnant or lactating women should and children under 18 should consult their qualified healthcare provider prior to use. Our phosphatidylcholine complex blend is formulated from non-GMO sunflower lecithin. IVtoGo utilizes Setria\u00ae Glutathione, China-free Vitamin C, and the highest quality natural flavors available. The formulation is soy, dairy, sugar, gluten, and alcohol-free. IVtoGo uses no solvents, which are common in commercial liposomal products, and each lot tests 100%-free of corn DNA and derivatives. IVtoGo is manufactured in the USA at 3rd-party certified CGMP facilities. Each lot is double-tested for correct vitamin content - before and after bottling - and assayed for lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, and all common pathogenic agents. All facilities are 100% vegan and free of common allergens. Only the purest available inputs are used. The formulation is 100% non-GMO and utilizes non-China components wherever possible. IVtoGo liposomes have a track record of efficacy in peer-reviewed, published studies - a distinction shared by few commercially produced liposomal nutraceuticals. No high pressure, solvents, or high temperature are required in the formation of our liposomes. This proprietary method produces liposomes with a peak particle size of 85nm, and 92% of total liposomes measuring between 60 and 172 nm. This tight distribution is indicative of a reproducible and highly controlled manufacturing methodology, and results in high-stability liposomes that do not require refrigeration (although it should be chilled for best flavor). Flavoring is added after liposome formation so as to avoid encapsulation of anything besides the desired payloads. Clinical studies show that liposomes in IVtoGo's size range pass the blood-brain barrier at 10-fold the rate of IV-administered supplements, and extravasate (penetrate tumor tissue) with maximum efficiency. - Pharmaceutical Grade Formulated by leading biochemists, IVtoGo liposomes have proven their efficacy in published, peer-reviewed studies - a distinction shared by very few commercially available liposomes. Our formulations are cGMP certified, meaning our production processes are inspected by the FDA and meet or exceed the same production standards as those adhered to by American pharmaceutical manufacturers. - - Clinically Proven Unlike many liposomes, IVtoGo is engineered at the required size for maximum performance. Studies show that liposomes in IVtoGo's size range offer maximum duration in the blood, and penetrate tumors more effectively.

With my doctor, my health stabilized enough that I could begin to enjoy life again. For me that meant a walk twice a week, church once a week, and the ability to enjoy my family again. Over the past 18 months, I have gradually lost the ground I had gained, until I realized I wasn't far from all day in bed. As I began to research my options, I found IVtoGo. I began Saturday, and yesterday had the first day in more than a year, that I could enjoy! My daughter is home from Seoul, I had additional family join us from out of state, and I was so very very blessed to be able to enjoy the time. Thank you for developing this product!\" \"This is the best I've felt in nine years. Thank you!\" \"Our family struggles with chronic illness, and this product is a Godsend. This is our second bottle, and it has really helped with brain fog, anxiety, and other neurological symptoms due to Lyme Disease and heavy metals. After trying several different products, it seems to me that the components are more bio-available in IVtoGo. It is also great that Glutathione and the B Vitamins are in it and in such large doses. I highly recommend it.\" \"My husband needs high dose vitamin C because of a number of health issues he has. But after a year of twice-weekly visits to the doctor for the IVs, he got totally burned out and took a break. His health declined soon after but then I found this product! I was so hopeful it would work and it really does! He said he felt better and from my vantage point, he functions just as well as getting the IVs (if not even better because so much of his time is freed up!). I even took some one day for the vitamin C when I was getting a cold and I noticed a huge difference in my energy (it knocked out my cold too)! I take it now also just for the vitamins. We're huge believers in this product and I'm so grateful for the non-IV option.\" \"I purchased IVtoGo because of cancer. I did my first treatment yesterday. From what I experienced, I'd say the cancer reacted to it! The taste is pleasant.\" Blog posts [ Particular Differences IVtoGo is a novel oral alternative to traditional IV vitamin C therapy that has revolutionized self-administered vitamin C therapy. "}
