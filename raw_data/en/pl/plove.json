Flu Treatment If you do get sick with flu, antiviral drugs - which are prescription medications - are a treatment option. These medications are most effective if taken early - within 48 hours (2 days) of getting sick. Antivirals can lessen your flu symptoms, shorten duration of illness, and help prevent severe flu illness and related complications. Antivirals are NOT a substitute for annual flu vaccination. Prompt treatment is recommended for people who have flu or suspected flu and who are at higher risk of serious flu complications, including those 65 years and older, young children, pregnant individuals, and people with [chronic health conditions](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/index.htm). The CDC recommends that healthcare providers treat patients with suspected or confirmed flu as soon as possible, specifically high-risk patients and those who are hospitalized and/or experiencing severe illness. Flu in Higher Risk Groups Children Flu can be very serious for children, especially those younger than 5 years old. Every year in the U.S.: - Flu-related hospitalizations for young children range from [6,000 - 27,000](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/children.htm) [Over 100 children](https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/PedFluDeath.html)under 18 years old lose their lives to flu Children age 6 months and older should receive a flu vaccine every year. Flu vaccines can be [lifesaving](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28557757/) in children. Some children age 6 months through 8 years need 2 doses of flu vaccine, spaced at least 4 weeks apart. These children include those who have never received a flu vaccine or have previously only received one dose of vaccine. Pregnant People Flu can cause severe illness in pregnant people due to changes in the immune system, heart, and lungs during pregnancy. Flu can also be dangerous for babies before and following birth when they're too young to be vaccinated themselves. Pregnant people can receive a flu shot during any trimester of their pregnancy but should not receive the live attenuated flu vaccine (also known as the nasal spray vaccine). Flu vaccination is safe for pregnant people and postpartum women, even if they are breastfeeding. Some benefits of flu vaccination in pregnant people are: - Reduces a pregnant person's risk of flu-related illness by [50%](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/pregnant.htm)and flu-related hospitalization by [40%](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/pregnant.htm) - Reduces an infant's risk of flu-related illness by [70%](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/137/6/e20152360/52373/Influenza-in-Infants-Born-to-Women-Vaccinated?redirectedFrom=fulltext)and flu-related hospitalization by [81%](https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/137/6/e20152360/52373/Influenza-in-Infants-Born-to-Women-Vaccinated?redirectedFrom=fulltext) Older Adults People 65 years and older account for [50 - 70%](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/65over.htm) of flu-related hospitalizations and [70 - 85%](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/65over.htm) of flu-related deaths. Older adults (seniors) are at increased risk of severe flu illness and flu-related complications due to age-related changes in their immune defenses. There is a preferential recommendation for older adults to receive a high-dose, adjuvanted, or recombinant flu vaccine because these types of flu vaccines may offer [enhanced protection](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0630-seniors-flu.html). People 65 years and older should also be up to date with [pneumococcal vaccination](https://vaccinateyourfamily.org/vaccines-diseases/). Some benefits of flu vaccination in older adults are: - Reduces the risk of flu-related hospitalization by an average of [40%](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-benefits.htm) - Reduces the risk of being admitted to an intensive care unit by [82%](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/vaccine-benefits.htm) People with Chronic Medical Conditions People living with chronic medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, lung disease, and chronic kidney disease are at an increased risk of severe flu-related outcomes like hospitalization and death. During recent flu seasons, [90%](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/highrisk/chronic-conditions/index.htm) of people hospitalized with flu had at least one underlying medical condition. Some benefits of flu vaccination in people with chronic conditions are: - Results in [lower rates of cardiac events](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24150467/)among people with heart disease - Reduces the risk of flu-related hospitalizations in people with diabetes by [79%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2809006/) - Reduces the risk of flu-related illness, hospitalization, and death in people with [chronic lung disease](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-130-5-199903020-00003) Stay Healthy This Flu Season In addition to getting your recommended routine immunizations, including a yearly flu vaccine and COVID vaccines, there are some other ways you can help protect yourself and your loved ones from dangerous infectious diseases: - Stay home if you're sick to avoid infecting others. - Cough or sneeze into your elbow or a tissue to avoid spreading germs onto your hands and nearby surfaces. - Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Germs spread this way. - Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.
