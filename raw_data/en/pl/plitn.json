The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/response/2022/us-map.html) reports a rising number of diagnosed cases in the United States. MercyOne infection prevention expert [Dr. Ravi Vemuri](https://www.mercyone.org/desmoines/find-a-doctor/provider-results?ProviderId=387&ProviderText=Ravi%20Vemuri,%20MD&SearchPattern=Contains&LocationDescendants=true) says people should learn the symptoms and what to do if they experience them. \"Monkeypox is a rare disease in the same virus group as smallpox and cowpox and was detected in Africa in 1958,\" shared Dr. Vemuri. \"The disease appeared in monkeys kept for research. The first human cases were described in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Until recently, monkeypox was considered a zoonotic disease, meaning animals were the source of infections passed to humans. Person-to-person transmission was extremely rare. It only occurred in health care workers exposed to an active case or close family members of an active case.\" Monkeypox is transmitted mostly by direct contact and very rarely by droplet. Typically an infected individual only has a chance of infecting intimate household contacts and health care workers before it is recognized as monkeypox. Symptoms can include: To prevent and protect yourself from monkeypox: If you become sick with monkeypox: Currently, there are no treatments specifically for monkeypox infections. The CDC has indicated since monkeypox and smallpox are in the same virus family \u2014 antiviral drugs and vaccines developed to protect against smallpox can be used to prevent or treat monkeypox. These vaccines are available and federal health agencies are providing access to them. \"The good news about monkeypox is the mortality rate seems to be low,\" shared Dr. Vemuri. \"It's important to practice prevention we have used during the COVID-19 pandemic. If you develop a rash, lesions or symptoms you suspect might be monkeypox - contact your physician or care provider.\" Additional "}
