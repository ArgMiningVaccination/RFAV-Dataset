Pursuant to Article 4 or Article 8, an authorisation may also be required for the export to all or certain destinations of certain dual-use items not listed in Annex I. Article 4 1. An authorisation shall be required for the export of dual-use items not listed in Annex I if the exporter has been informed by the competent authorities of the Member State in which he is established that the items in question are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for use in connection with the development, production, handling, operation, maintenance, storage, detection, identification or dissemination of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices or the development, production, maintenance or storage of missiles capable of delivering such weapons. 2. An authorisation shall also be required for the export of dual-use items not listed in Annex I if the purchasing country or country of destination is subject to an arms embargo M1 imposed by a decision or a common position adopted by the Council or a decision of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) or an arms embargo imposed by a binding resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations and if the exporter has been informed by the authorities referred to in paragraph 1 that the items in question are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for a military end-use.

B 02009R0428 \u2014 EN \u2014 31.12.2019 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 5 4. If an exporter is aware that dual-use items which he proposes to export, not listed in Annex I, are intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, he must notify the authorities referred to in paragraph 1, which will decide whether or not it is expedient to make the export concerned subject to authorisation. 5. A Member State may adopt or maintain national legislation imposing an authorisation requirement on the export of dual-use items not listed in Annex I if the exporter has grounds for suspecting that those items are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in paragraph 1. 6. A Member State which imposes an authorisation requirement, in application of paragraphs 1 to 5, on the export of a dual-use item not listed in Annex I, shall, where appropriate, inform the other Member States and the Commission. The other Member States shall give all due consideration to this information and shall inform their customs admin \u00ad istration and other relevant national authorities. 7. The provisions of Article 13(1), (2) and (5) to (7) shall apply to cases concerning dual-use items not listed in Annex I. 8. This Regulation is without prejudice to the right of Member States to take national measures under Article 11 of Regulation (EEC) No 2603/69. Article 5 1.

If a broker is aware that the dual-use items listed in Annex I for which he proposes brokering services are intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1), he must notify the competent authorities which will decide whether or not it is expedient to make such brokering services subject to authorisation. 2. A Member State may extend the application of paragraph 1 to non-listed dual-use items for uses referred to in Article 4(1) and to dual-use items for military end use and destinations referred to in Article 4(2). 3. A Member State may adopt or maintain national legislation imposing an authorisation requirement on the brokering of dual-use items, if the broker has grounds for suspecting that these items are or may be intended for any of the uses referred to in Article 4(1). 4. The provisions of Article 8(2), (3) and (4) shall apply to the national measures referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article. Article 6 1. The transit of non-Community dual-use items listed in Annex I may be prohibited by the competent authorities of the Member State where the transit occurs if the items are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for uses referred to in Article 4(1). When deciding on B 02009R0428 \u2014 EN \u2014 31.12.2019 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 6 such a prohibition the Member States shall take into account their obligations and commitments they have agreed to as parties to inter \u00ad national treaties or as members of international non-proliferation regimes. 2. Before deciding whether or not to prohibit a transit a Member State may provide that its competent authorities may impose in indi \u00ad vidual cases an authorisation requirement for the specific transit of dual-use items listed in Annex I if the items are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for uses referred to in Article 4(1). 3. A Member State may extend the application of paragraph 1 to non-listed dual-use items for uses referred to in Article 4(1) and to dual-use items for military end use and destinations referred to in Article 4(2). 4. The provisions of Article 8(2), (3) and (4) shall apply to the national measures referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.

A Member State may prohibit or impose an authorisation requirement on the export of dual-use items not listed in Annex I for reasons of public security or human rights considerations. 2. Member States shall notify the Commission of any measures adopted pursuant to paragraph 1 immediately after their adoption and indicate the precise reasons for the measures. 3. Member States shall also immediately notify the Commission of any modifications to measures adopted pursuant to paragraph 1. 4. The Commission shall publish the measures notified to it pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union . CHAPTER III EXPORT AUTHORISATION AND AUTHORISATION FOR BROKERING SERVICES Article 9 M1 1. Union General Export Authorisations for certain exports as set out in Annexes IIa to IIf are established by this Regulation. B 02009R0428 \u2014 EN \u2014 31.12.2019 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 7 The competent authorities of the Member State where the exporter is established can prohibit the exporter from using these authorisations if there is reasonable suspicion about his ability to comply with such authorisation or with a provision of the export control legislation. The competent authorities of the Member States shall exchange information on exporters deprived of the right to use a Union General Export Authorisation, unless they determine that the exporter will not attempt to export dual-use items through another Member State. The system referred to in Article 19(4) shall be used for this purpose. M3 In order to ensure that only low-risk transactions are covered by the Union General Export Authorisations included in Annexes IIa to IIf, the Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 23a to remove destinations from the scope of those Union General Export Authorisations, if such destinations become subject to an arms embargo as referred to in Article 4(2). Where, in cases of such arms embargoes, imperative grounds of urgency require a removal of particular destinations from the scope of a Union General Export Authorisation, the procedure provided for in Article 23b shall apply to delegated acts adopted pursuant to this paragraph. B 2. For all other exports for which an authorisation is required under this Regulation, such authorisation shall be granted by the competent authorities of the Member State where the exporter is established. Subject to the restrictions specified in paragraph 4, this authorisation may be an individual, global or general authorisation. All the authorisations shall be valid throughout the Community. Exporters shall supply the competent authorities with all relevant information required for their applications for individual and global export authorisation so as to provide complete information to the national competent authorities in particular on the end user, the country of destination and the end use of the item exported. The auth \u00ad orisation may be subject, if appropriate, to an end-use statement. 3. Member States shall process requests for individual or global authorisations within a period of time to be determined by national law or practice. 4. National general export authorisations shall: M1 (a) exclude from their scope items listed in Annex IIg; B (b) be defined by national law or practice. They may be used by all exporters, established or resident in the Member State issuing these authorisations, if they meet the requirements set in this Regulation and in the complementary national legislation. They shall be issued in accordance with the indications set out in Annex IIIc. They shall be issued according to national law or practice; M1 02009R0428 \u2014 EN \u2014 31.12.2019 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 8 Member States shall notify the Commission immediately of any national general export authorisations issued or modified. The Commission shall publish these notifications in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union ; (c) not be used if the exporter has been informed by his authorities that the items in question are or may be intended, in their entirety or in part, for any of the uses referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 4 or in paragraph 2 of Article 4 in a country subject to an arms embargo M1 imposed by a decision or a common position adopted by the Council or a decision of the OSCE or an arms embargo imposed by a binding resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations, or if the exporter is aware that the items are intended for the abovementioned uses. 5. Member States shall maintain or introduce in their respective national legislation the possibility of granting a global export authorisation. 6. Member States shall supply the Commission with a list of the authorities empowered to: (a) grant export authorisations for dual-use items; (b) decide to prohibit the transit of non-Community dual-use items under this Regulation. The Commission shall publish the list of these authorities in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union . Article 10 1. Authorisations for brokering services under this Regulation shall be granted by the competent authorities of the Member State where the broker is resident or established. These authorisations shall be granted for a set quantity of specific items moving between two or more third countries. The location of the items in the originating third country, the end-user and its exact location must be clearly identified. The author \u00ad isations shall be valid throughout the Community. 2. Brokers shall supply the competent authorities with all relevant information required for their application for authorisation under this Regulation for brokering services, in particular details of the location of the dual-use items in the originating third country, a clear description of the items and the quantity involved, third parties involved in the transaction, the third country of destination, the end-user in that country and its exact location. 3. Member States shall process requests for authorisations for brokering services within a period of time to be determined by national law or practice. 4. Member States shall supply the Commission with a list of the authorities empowered to grant authorisations under this Regulation for the provision of brokering services. The Commission shall publish the list of these authorities in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union . Article 11 1. If the dual-use items in respect of which an application has been made for an individual export authorisation to a destination not listed in M1 Annex IIa or to any destination in the case of dual-use items listed in Annex IV are or will be located in one or more Member States B 02009R0428 \u2014 EN \u2014 31.12.2019 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 9 other than the one where the application has been made, that fact shall be indicated in the application. The competent authorities of the Member State to which the application for authorisation has been made shall immediately consult the competent authorities of the Member State or States in question and provide the relevant information. The Member State or States consulted shall make known within 10 working days any objections it or they may have to the granting of such an authorisation, which shall bind the Member State in which the application has been made. If no objections are received within 10 working days, the Member State or States consulted shall be regarded as having no objection. In exceptional cases, any Member State consulted may request the extension of the 10-day period. However, the extension may not exceed 30 working days. 2. If an export might prejudice its essential security interests, a Member State may request another Member State not to grant an export authorisation or, if such authorisation has been granted, request its annulment, suspension, modification or revocation. The Member State receiving such a request shall immediately engage in consultations of a non-binding nature with the requesting Member State, to be terminated within 10 working days. In case the requested Member State decides to grant the authorisation, this should be notified to the Commission and other Member States using the electronic system mentioned in Article 13(6). Article 12 1. In deciding whether or not to grant an individual or global export authorisation or to grant an authorisation for brokering services under this Regulation, the Member States shall take into account all relevant considerations including: (a) the obligations and commitments they have each accepted as members of the relevant international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant inter \u00ad national treaties; (b) their obligations under sanctions imposed by M1 a decision or a common position adopted by the Council or by a decision of the OSCE or by a binding resolution of the Security Council of the United Nations; (c) considerations of national foreign and security policy, including those covered by Council Common Position 2008/944/CFSP of 8 December 2008 defining common rules governing control of exports of military technology and equipment ( 1 ); B ( 1 ) OJ L 335, 13.12.2008, p. 99. 02009R0428 \u2014 EN \u2014 31.12.2019 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 10 (d) considerations about intended end use and the risk of diversion. 2. In addition to the criteria set in paragraph 1, when assessing an application for a global export authorisation Member States shall take into consideration the application by the exporter of proportionate and adequate means and procedures to ensure compliance with the provisions and objectives of this Regulation and with the terms and conditions of the authorisation. Article 13 1. The competent authorities of the Member States, acting in accordance with this Regulation, may refuse to grant an export author \u00ad isation and may annul, suspend, modify or revoke an export authoris \u00ad ation which they have already granted. Where they refuse, annul, suspend, substantially limit or revoke an export authorisation or when they have determined that the intended export is not to be authorised, they shall notify the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission thereof and share the relevant information with them. In case the competent authorities of a Member State have suspended an export authorisation, the final assessment shall be communicated to the Member States and the Commission at the end of the period of suspension. 2. The competent authorities of Member States shall review denials of authorisations notified under paragraph 1 within three years of their notification and revoke them, amend them or renew them. The competent authorities of the Member States will notify the results of the review to the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission as soon as possible. Denials which are not revoked shall remain valid. 3. The competent authorities of the Member States shall notify the Member States and the Commission of their decisions to prohibit a transit of dual-use items listed in Annex I taken under Article 6 without delay. These notifications will contain all relevant information including the classification of the item, its technical parameters, the country of destination and the end user. 4. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall also apply to authorisations for brokering services. 5. Before the competent authorities of a Member State, acting under this Regulation, grant an authorisation for export or brokering services or decide on a transit they shall examine all valid denials or decisions to prohibit a transit of dual-use items listed in Annex I taken under this Regulation to ascertain whether an authorisation or a transit has been denied by the competent authorities of another Member State or States for an essentially identical transaction (meaning an item with essentially identical parameters or technical characteristics to the same end user or consignee). They shall first consult the competent authorities of the Member State or States which issued such denial(s) or decisions to prohibit the transit as provided for in paragraphs 1 and 3. If following such consultation the competent authorities of the Member State decide to grant an authorisation or allow the transit, they shall notify the competent authorities of the other Member States and the Commission, providing all relevant information to explain the decision. B 02009R0428 \u2014 EN \u2014 31.12.2019 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 11 6. All notifications required pursuant to this Article shall be made via secure electronic means including the system referred to in Article 19(4). B 7. All information shared in accordance with the provisions of this Article shall be in compliance with the provisions of Article 19(3), (4) and (6) concerning the confidentiality of such information. Article 14 1. All individual and global export authorisations and authorisations for brokering services shall be issued in writing or by electronic means on forms containing at least all the elements and in the order set out in the models which appear in Annexes IIIa and IIIb. 2. At the request of exporters, global export authorisations that contain quantitative limitations shall be split. CHAPTER IV UPDATING OF LIST OF DUAL-USE ITEMS Article 15 1. The list of dual-use items set out in Annex I shall be updated in conformity with the relevant obligations and commitments, and any modification thereof, that Member States have accepted as members of the international non-proliferation regimes and export control arrangements, or by ratification of relevant international treaties. 2. Annex IV, which is a subset of Annex I, shall be updated with regard to Article 30 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, namely the public policy and public security interests of the Member States. M3 3. The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 23a concerning updating the list of dual-use items set out in Annex I. The updating of Annex I shall be performed within the scope set out in paragraph 1 of this Article. Where the updating of Annex I concerns dual-use items which are also listed in Annexes IIa to IIg or IV, those Annexes shall be amended accordingly. B CHAPTER V CUSTOMS PROCEDURES Article 16 1. When completing the formalities for the export of dual-use items at the customs office responsible for handling the export declaration, the exporter shall furnish proof that any necessary export authorisation has been obtained. 2. A translation of any documents furnished as proof into an official language of the Member State where the export declaration is presented may be required of the exporter. M1 02009R0428 \u2014 EN \u2014 31.12.2019 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 12 3. Without prejudice to any powers conferred on it under, and pursuant to, the Community Customs Code, a Member State may also, for a period not exceeding the periods referred to in paragraph 4, suspend the process of export from its territory, or, if necessary, otherwise prevent the dual-use items listed in Annex I which are covered by a valid export authorisation from leaving the Community via its territory, where it has grounds for suspicion that: (a) relevant information was not taken into account when the authoris \u00ad ation was granted, or (b) circumstances have materially changed since the grant of the authorisation. 4. In the case referred to in paragraph 3, the competent authorities of the Member State which granted the export authorisation shall be consulted forthwith in order that they may take action pursuant to Article 13(1). If such competent authorities decide to maintain the auth \u00ad orisation, they shall reply within 10 working days, which, at their request, may be extended to 30 working days in exceptional circum \u00ad stances. In such case, or if no reply is received within 10 or 30 days, as the case may be, the dual-use items shall be released immediately. The Member State which granted the authorisation shall inform the other Member States and the Commission. Article 17 1. Member States may provide that customs formalities for the export of dual-use items may be completed only at customs offices empowered to that end. 2. Member States availing themselves of the option set out in paragraph 1 shall inform the Commission of the duly empowered customs offices. The Commission shall publish the information in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union . Article 18 The provisions of Articles 843 and 912a to 912g of Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 shall apply to the restrictions relating to the export, re-export and exit from the customs territory of dual-use items for the export of which an authorisation is required under this Regulation. CHAPTER VI ADMINISTRATIVE COOPERATION Article 19 1. Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, shall take all appropriate measures to establish direct cooperation and exchange of information between competent authorities, in particular to eliminate the risk that possible disparities in the application of export controls to dual-use items may lead to a deflection of trade, which could create difficulties for one or more Member States. B 02009R0428 \u2014 EN \u2014 31.12.2019 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 13 2. Member States shall take all appropriate measures to establish direct cooperation and exchange of information between competent authorities with a view to enhance the efficiency of the Community export control regime. Such information may include: (a) details of exporters deprived, by national sanctions, of the right to use the national general export authorisations or M1 Union General Export Authorisations ; (b) data on sensitive end users, actors involved in suspicious procurement activities, and, where available, routes taken. 3. Council Regulation (EC) No 515/97 of 13 March 1997 on mutual assistance between the administrative authorities of the Member States and cooperation between the latter and the Commission to ensure the correct application of the law on customs and agricultural matters ( 1 ), and in particular the provisions on the confidentiality of information, shall apply mutatis mutandis , without prejudice to Article 23 of this Regulation. M1 4. A secure and encrypted system for the exchange of information between Member States and, whenever appropriate, the Commission shall be set up by the Commission, in consultation with the Dual-Use Coordination Group set up pursuant to Article 23. The European Parliament shall be informed about the system's budget, development, provisional and final set-up and functioning, and network costs. B 5. The provision of guidance to exporters and brokers will be the responsibility of the Member States where they are resident or estab \u00ad lished. The Commission and the Council may also make available guidance and/or recommendations for best practices for the subjects referred to in this Regulation. 6. The processing of personal data shall be in accordance with the rules laid down in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the movement of such data ( 2 ) and Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of indi \u00ad viduals with regard to the processing of personal data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data ( 3 ).

References in this Annex that state 'SEE ALSO MILITARY GOODS CONTROLS' refer to the same lists. 2. The object of the controls contained in this Annex should not be defeated by the export of any non-controlled goods (including plant) containing one or more controlled components when the controlled component or components are the principal element of the goods and can feasibly be removed or used for other purposes. N.B. In judging whether the controlled component or components are to be considered the principal element, it is necessary to weigh the factors of quantity, value and technological know-how involved and other special circumstances which might establish the controlled component or components as the principal element of the goods being procured. 3. Goods specified in this Annex include both new and used goods. M9 ( \u2014 31.12.2019 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 20 4. In some instances chemicals are listed by name and CAS number. The list applies to chemicals of the same structural formula (including hydrates) regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying a particular chemical or mixture, irrespective of nomenclature. CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers because some forms of the listed chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a listed chemical may also have different CAS numbers. NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY NOTE (NTN) (To be read in conjunction with section E of Category 0.) The 'technology' directly associated with any goods controlled in Category 0 is controlled according to the provisions of Category 0. 'Technology' for the 'development', ' production' or 'use' of goods under control remains under control even when applicable to non-controlled goods. The approval of goods for export also authorizes the export to the same end-user of the minimum 'technology' required for the installation, operation, maintenance and repair of the goods. Controls on 'technology' transfer do not apply to information 'in the public domain' or to 'basic scientific research'. GENERAL TECHNOLOGY NOTE (GTN) (To be read in conjunction with section E of Categories 1 to 9.) The export of 'technology' which is 'required' for the 'development', 'production' or 'use' of goods controlled in Categories 1 to 9, is controlled according to the provisions of Categories 1 to 9. 'Technology' 'required' for the 'development', 'production' or 'use' of goods under control remains under control even when applicable to non-controlled goods.

Rotary axes need not rotate over 360\u00b0. A rotary axis can be driven by a linear device (e.g., a screw or a rack-and-pinion). 2. For the purposes of 2B, the number of axes which can be co-ordinated simultaneously for 'contouring control' is the number of axes along or around which, during processing of the workpiece, simultaneous and interrelated motions are performed between the workpiece and a tool. This does not include any additional axes along or around which other relative movement within the machine are performed such as: a. Wheel-dressing systems in grinding machines; b.

These arithmetic mean values of 'unidi \u00ad rectional positioning repeatability' (UPR ) become the stated value of each axis for the model (UPR x , UPR y , ...); d. Since the Category 2 list refers to each linear axis there will be as many 'stated 'unidirectional positioning repeatability' values as there are linear axes; M9 02009R0428 \u2014 EN \u2014 31.12.2019 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 113 2B Technical Notes: 5.

Test segments are equally spaced along the full axis length, with any excess length equally divided at the beginning, in between, and at the end of the test segments. The smallest 'unidirectional positioning repeatability'-value of all test segments is to be reported. 2B001 Machine tools and any combination thereof, for removing (or cutting) metals, ceramics or 'composites', which, according to the manufacturer's technical specification, can be equipped with electronic devices for 'numerical control', as follows: N.B.

TABLE - DEPOSITION TECHNIQUES - TECHNICAL NOTE Processes specified in Column 1 of the Table are defined as follows: a. Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) is an overlay coating or surface modifi \u00ad cation coating process wherein a metal, alloy, 'composite', dielectric or ceramic is deposited upon a heated substrate. Gaseous reactants are decomposed or combined in the vicinity of a substrate resulting in the deposition of the desired elemental, alloy or compound material on the substrate. Energy for this decomposition or chemical reaction process may be provided by the heat of the substrate, a glow discharge plasma, or 'laser' irradiation. N.B.1 CVD includes the following processes: directed gas flow out-of-pack deposition, pulsating CVD, controlled nucleation thermal deposition (CNTD), plasma enhanced or plasma assisted CVD processes. N.B.2 Pack denotes a substrate immersed in a powder mixture. M9 02009R0428 \u2014 EN \u2014 31.12.2019 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 151 N.B.3 The gaseous reactants used in the out-of-pack process are produced using the same basic reactions and parameters as the pack cemen \u00ad tation process, except that the substrate to be coated is not in contact with the powder mixture. b. Thermal Evaporation-Physical Vapour Deposition (TE-PVD) is an overlay coating process conducted in a vacuum with a pressure less than 0,1 Pa wherein a source of thermal energy is used to vaporize the coating material. This process results in the condensation, or deposition, of the evap \u00ad orated species onto appropriately positioned substrates. The addition of gases to the vacuum chamber during the coating process to synthesize compound coatings is an ordinary modification of the process. The use of ion or electron beams, or plasma, to activate or assist the coating's deposition is also a common modification in this technique. The use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thickness of coatings can be a feature of these processes. Specific TE-PVD processes are as follows: 1. Electron Beam PVD uses an electron beam to heat and evaporate the material which forms the coating; 2. Ion Assisted Resistive Heating PVD employs electrically resistive heating sources in combination with impinging ion beam(s) to produce a controlled and uniform flux of evaporated coating species; 3. 'Laser' Vaporization uses either pulsed or continuous wave 'laser' beams to vaporize the material which forms the coating; 4. Cathodic Arc Deposition employs a consumable cathode of the material which forms the coating and has an arc discharge established on the surface by a momentary contact of a ground trigger. Controlled motion of arcing erodes the cathode surface creating a highly ionized plasma. The anode can be either a cone attached to the periphery of the cathode, through an insulator, or the chamber. Substrate biasing is used for non line-of-sight deposition; N.B. This definition does not include random cathodic arc deposition with non-biased substrates. 5. Ion Plating is a special modification of a general TE-PVD process in which a plasma or an ion source is used to ionize the species to be deposited, and a negative bias is applied to the substrate in order to facilitate the extraction of the species from the plasma. The introduction of reactive species, evaporation of solids within the process chamber, and the use of monitors to provide in-process measurement of optical characteristics and thicknesses of coatings are ordinary modifications of the process. c. Pack Cementation is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a substrate is immersed in a powder mixture (a pack), that consists of: 1. The metallic powders that are to be deposited (usually aluminium, chromium, silicon or combinations thereof); M9 02009R0428 \u2014 EN \u2014 31.12.2019 \u2014 010.001 \u2014 152 2. An activator (normally a halide salt); and 3. An inert powder, most frequently alumina. The substrate and powder mixture is contained within a retort which is heated to between 1 030 K (757 \u00b0C) and 1 375 K (1 102 \u00b0C) for sufficient time to deposit the coating. d. Plasma Spraying is an overlay coating process wherein a gun (spray torch) which produces and controls a plasma accepts powder or wire coating materials, melts them and propels them towards a substrate, whereon an integrally bonded coating is formed. Plasma spraying constitutes either low pressure plasma spraying or high velocity plasma spraying. N.B.1 Low pressure means less than ambient atmospheric pressure. N.B.2 High velocity refers to nozzle-exit gas velocity exceeding 750 m/s calculated at 293 K (20 \u00b0C) at 0,1 MPa. e. Slurry Deposition is a surface modification coating or overlay coating process wherein a metallic or ceramic powder with an organic binder is suspended in a liquid and is applied to a substrate by either spraying, dipping or painting, subsequent air or oven drying, and heat treatment to obtain the desired coating. f. Sputter Deposition is an overlay coating process based on a momentum transfer phenomenon, wherein positive ions are accelerated by an electric field towards the surface of a target (coating material). The kinetic energy of the impacting ions is sufficient to cause target surface atoms to be released and deposited on an appropriately positioned substrate. N.B.1 The Table refers only to triode, magnetron or reactive sputter deposition which is used to increase adhesion of the coating and rate of deposition and to radio frequency (RF) augmented sputter deposition used to permit vaporisation of non-metallic coating materials. N.B.2 Low-energy ion beams (less than 5 keV) can be used to activate the deposition. g.

Calculate 'APP' as 'APP' = W 1 x R 1 + W 2 x R 2 + ... + W n x R n . 4. For 'vector processors', W i = 0,9. For non-'vector processors', W i = 0,3. Note 1 For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as addition and multiplication, each operation is counted. Note 2 For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate. Note 3 The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the 'APP' of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer. Note 4 Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating 'APP'. Note 5 'APP' values are not to be calculated for processor combinations (inter)connected by 'Local Area Networks', Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by 'software'. Note 6 'APP' values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors specially designed to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory; Technical Note: 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simul \u00ad taneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using 'electronic assemblies' specified in 4A003.c. Note 7 A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.
