I had been diagnosed with cancer and was looking for anything to help me heal. I am so grateful that I am open to trying new things, especially healing modalities, as long as it doesn't involve pain! I've learned that the world is abundant in healing resources. We just have to know how to tap into them. I'm always a little curious why a person wouldn't want to try another form of healing, especially if it worked and was without the side effects of western medication? Most alternative therapies involve getting to the root of a problem and not just masking the symptoms. Works for me! My Reiki experiences have been extraordinary in terms of physical, emotional and spiritual healing. It's been a regular part of my overall healthcare program for the past many years. I have been blessed along the way as I have been introduced to a gifted Reiki master and practitioner here in Denver. I was introduced through a mutual friend who practices healthy living as well. Funny how the circle keeps expanding - I love it! Reiki with JoAnne has been magical. When the heart and mind are full of peace and joy, the message is sent throughout the body, fueling healthy cells. I continue my sessions with JoAnne as a way to stay healthy and to deepen my spirituality. It's my great pleasure to introduce JoAnne Palladino, healer extraordinaire and teacher, to my readers this week. I've asked her to give a brief idea of what Reiki healing is to those of you who have never had the pleasure of experiencing it. Reiki \u2014 An ancient healing method practiced in the 21st century By JoAnne Palladino You may have heard of \"laying on of hands,\" a healing practice that is centuries old. It is our instinctual nature to place hands on someone who is in need, whether it is a child who is hurt or a person who is in the process of dying. The power of touch is a simple yet remarkably effective way to bring healing care to those who are in need. This ancient method of healing is being used today in various settings whether at a holistic practitioner's office, in a hospital setting, at hospice facilities or with cancer treatment programs. So what is this healing method that is now being used in mainstream settings? It is Reiki, pronounced \"Ray Key,\" a Japanese word meaning \"universal life force energy.' It was discovered in the late 1800s by Dr. Mikao Usui, from his years of studying ancient teachings and practices. The clarity of understanding the power of hands on energy healing was revealed to him when he was in a deep meditative state. Reiki is based on the truth that our bodies are a form of life force energy. We are healthy when this energy flows without disruption. The opposite is also true, if the energy is sluggish or blocked what begins to manifest is dis-ease. The sluggish energy can be caused by negative thoughts, depleting habitual behavioral patterns and suppressed emotions. Clearly, if our body's energy flow is compromised it effects our state of well-being. It can cause anxiety, depression, fatigue, headaches, body aches, insomnia and disease. Reiki can help with all of these health challenges and more. So how does Reiki work? A trained practitioner gently places their hands on you connecting with your body's energy flow feeling where the energy blockages are being held. The practitioner then directs the Reiki energy to flow through the affected areas of dense or negative energy transforming it with high vibrational positive energy. This allows a clearing, which strengthens and heals the energy pathways, thus allowing the life force to flow in a healthy and natural way. Experiences vary but what is common is that you may feel a deep sense of calm and relaxation, symptoms will be gone or reduced, and you will feel more energized and have clarity of mind. Sessions are usually an hour long and are experienced in person or through distance healing. The session unfolds by you sharing with the practitioner what your challenges are whether on an emotional, mental, physical or spiritual level. You receive the treatment fully clothed on a message table. This will begin the process to locate and release energy blockages that the body is holding. The number of sessions that can support you will be determined after your initial visit. The cost can vary from $65 to $150 per hour and at times cost saving packages are available. There are various levels of training to be a Reiki practitioner and anyone can learn it. Each of these levels, Level 1, 2, Master and Teacher, brings a deeper understanding of life force energy and how to work with it. Word of mouth, the Internet, local holistic wellness centers or wellness publications are all great ways to find a qualified Reiki Practitioner.
