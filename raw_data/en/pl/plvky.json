Over the past 17 years, we have witnessed an explosion of companies with devices that promise a less toxic way to deliver nicotine and cannabinoids to consumers than traditional smoking. As the technology of this industry has evolved we have witnessed controversy and new safety concerns about the additives used for delivery, coloring, flavoring and stabilizing these products, we have also witnessed an increase in potentially addictive activity in younger people. 'Vaping' has become so commonplace that it has become a source of friction between parents and their children, schools and their students, even workers in their workplaces. The commonly held idea is that the second-hand 'smoke' from these devices is harmless and non-toxic, however, that may depend on the individual and the product being used. There have been some notable public health crises related to vaping that are useful to consider, as well as some of the regulatory attempts by the FDA that reflect their thinking on how best to regulate this industry. Amidst all of this controversy, vaping has become an increasingly popular pursuit that is not likely to go away anytime soon. 10:30 AM - Noon, Eastern Time [Restoring Mitochondrial Function through Botanicals ND, RH (AHG) Mitochondrial dysfunction is characterized by the reduction of energy output from the electron transport chain. Research confirms that reduced mitochondrial function is associated with nearly all chronic conditions, including neurodegenerative, psychiatric, cardiovascular, metabolic, autoimmune, cancer, chronic immune disorders and musculoskeletal. This lecture covers symptoms that are suggestive of mitochondrial concerns and testing methods to determine treatment strategies. These include botanicals specific to organ systems, nutrients and nutritional protocols to increase efficiency and restore function to mitochondria. (Schedule subject to minor changes. All times are Eastern time zone.) Saturday, June 5 10:30 - 12:00 PM, Eastern Time [Effective Pain Relief with Botanical and Nutritional Medicine ](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Effective-Pain-Relief-with-Botanical-and-Nutritional-Medicine) David Winston, RH (AHG) The search for effective, safe and non-addictive pain medication is an age-old quest. Studies show many people, especially the elderly, the poor, people of color and women are under-treated for chronic pain. While herbs are not as powerful as opiates and other pharmaceutical medications, they can offer safer and often highly effective pain management. In this talk we discuss how specific herbs can relieve specific types of pain, how to combine herbs to create a synergistic effect and reduce inflammation, pain perception and spasm and how botanicals can enhance the effects of pharmaceutical pain medications. 12:30 PM - 2:00 PM, Eastern Time [Panel: Managing Symptoms of Hormonal Disruption with Botanical Medicine](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Panel-Managing-Symptoms-of-Hormonal-Disruption-with-Botanical-Medicine) focus is on endocrine disruptors in the environment. What does that mean, what compounds are endocrine disruptors, how can we avoid them, how do we get them out of the body once we are exposed? Do foods, herbs, legumes, fiber protect against environmental agents? 2:30 PM - 4:00 PM, Eastern Time [Botanical Medicine Targeting Cancer Stem Cells](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Botanical-Medicine-Targeting-Cancer-Stem-Cells) Donald Yance, RH (AHG) Cancer stem cells are a subpopulation of cancer cells that reside underneath the surface. It is like the root system of the cancer, which is responsible for cancer migration, invasion and chemotherapy resistance. Cancer stem cells also give rise to tumor bulk through continuous self-renewal and differentiation. Understanding stem cell signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms is essential for developing botanical and nutritional therapies. The research shows the unique and very promising effect of these therapies, which target specific cancer signaling pathways responsible for chemotherapy resistance, alterations of cellular metabolism and impaired apoptosis. We highlight numerous natural compounds including PM - 8:30 PM, Eastern Time [Keynote Panel: Honoring Our Teachers - Stories from the Early Years of Modern Herbalism](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Keynote-Panel-Honoring-Our-Teachers-Stories-from-the-Early-Years-of-Modern-Herbalism) Speakers: Deborah Frances, ND, Kat Maier, RH (AHG) and Mary Bove, ND What brought you to the path of healing with botanical medicine? Remember your own stories when you hear three speakers talk about the beginning days of their life path and who and what inspired them on the way. How do we use this information to navigate the future of herbalism? Sunday, June 6 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM, Eastern Time [Conquering Toxic Mold Exposure](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Conquering-Toxic-Mold-Exposure) Jill Crista, ND Climate change and building practices have created the perfect storm for indoor mold blooms. Unfortunately, few agencies responsible for defining mold-related illness recognize the deleterious health impacts from mold mycotoxins. Therefore, many cases of mold illness are misidentified, and the cause goes untreated, resulting in needless suffering. I'm on a mission to raise medical literacy about mold and mold-related illness. In my experience, natural medicine holds the key to conquering this problem. In this presentation, we will define mold illness and the mechanisms for creating illness, identify the symptoms of mold illness, including a useful clinical questionnaire and discuss lab testing options and limitations. Learn naturopathic approaches to treatment including foods, beverages and supplements that help and hinder including treatise on bile, binders, and cholagogues. Presentation will also help attendees identify select tools to protect and repair from mold mycotoxin exposure, and explore both systemic and intranasal antifungal treatment. Botanicals covered include aloe, green tea, milk thistle, turmeric, artichoke, holy basil, thyme and more. 12:30 PM - 2:00 PM, Eastern Time [Panel: Restoring Mental Health in the 21st Century: Managing Chronic Overwhelm ](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Panel-Restoring-Mental-Health-in-the-21st-Century-Managing-Chronic-Overwhelm) Teresa Boardwine, RH (AHG), Katie Stage, ND and David Winston, RH (AHG) Those patients who tend to be overwhelmed by life events have been especially challenged this past year with political, social and environmental difficulties at every turn. These events have driven more people into a state of being chronically overwhelmed. What do we recommend to restore equilibrium in these times, both for ourselves as practitioners and our patients? Discover lifestyle, botanical and nutritional therapies you may not have yet considered. 2:30 PM - 4:00 PM, Eastern Time [Cannabis in Medicine: Applications and Limitations](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Cannabis-in-Medicine-Applications-and-Limitations) Jason Miller, DACM Emerging research on Cannabis corroborates its use for pain, nausea, PTSD and other mental health conditions, but it has to be used with care and knowledge. Cannabis also has an addiction profile similar to alcohol and with widespread legalization these side effects are becoming better-known. Explore these applications and limitations with an experienced practitioner with a common-sense approach. 5:00 PM - 6:30 PM, Eastern Time [The Chemistry of Flavors: Expanding our Palette and Increasing our Neural Connections (Demonstration with audience participation) ](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/The-Chemistry-of-Flavors-Expanding-our-Palette-and-Increasing-our-Neural-Connections) Kenneth Proefrock, NMD Taste brings in at least eight categories of specific sensory experience: sour, sweet, salty, bitter, savory, pungent, spicy and astringent, with an additional component of texture and mouth-feel. Expanding the dietary/flavor palette provides new and interesting input to our palate and, it turns out, has a stimulating effect on the genesis of neural connections in our nervous system and a dramatic effect on our memory. Here we provide a context for expanding one's palate and calibrating that experience in a meaningful way that is specific to healing and botanical medicine. You'll receive a list of flavor-rich foods and herbs to try at home during the lecture. Included in this discussion is a review of the conceptions of food energetics from Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic medicine as well as western sensibilities about flavor profiles and energetics. Monday, June 7 10:00 AM - 11:30 AM, Eastern Time [Botanical Therapies for Childhood Asthma](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Botanical-Therapies-for-Childhood-Asthma) Mary Bove, ND Currently there are over 6 million children in the USA suffering from asthma. Asthma is a common reason for kids missing school and one of the most common chronic health conditions that affect children. Management is key for reducing the occurrence, severity, and frequency of the symptoms along with improving quality of life. Look at botanical, nutritional, dietary, and lifestyle strategies for managing chronic asthma as well as dealing with acute asthmatic events. 12:30 PM - 2:00 PM, Eastern Time [Clinical the colchicine alkaloid, well known for quickly reducing inflammation in gouty arthritis. However, Colchicum may have many other uses due to affects on microtubules of the cytoskeleton, affecting mitosis, vesicle trafficking, and cellular structure and dynamics. Despite potential toxicity, long-term use of colchicine is shown to be safe in children, and even in pregnant and nursing women when used in very small amounts to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other collagen vascular diseases. This presentation will review the history of the alkaloid as well as current research on the plant of conditions other than gout. [IN-PERSON FIELD STUDIES and HERB WALKS] These events are open to a small number of local participants and will take place near Asheville, NC, safety guidelines permitting.

Continuing Education not available for in-person events this year. Will not be recorded. (Available on-demand from anywhere) Teresa Boardwine, RH (AHG) [Trauma-Informed Care: First Aid for Practitioners ](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Trauma-Informed-Care-First-Aid-for-Practitioners) Responses to trauma vary: numbness and inability to experience feelings; extreme sadness; inability to concentrate; physical symptoms, etc. These feelings are a normal part of grieving and recovering from any trauma. If they persist for more than two weeks or begin to interfere with daily living, they are symptoms of a more serious episode of depression. This is a heightened reaction to an abnormal situation, not a character flaw or sign of personal weakness. The healing process takes time. Besides the usual recommendations to talk to friends and family, limit news exposure, keep to a daily routine of nourishing meals and plenty of rest, and get help if you need it, herbs can have a soothing effect on the whole system. Recommendations are included for soothing teas, herbal bathing, massage using essential oils, and aromatherapy. All can have a marked effect on speeding recovery and restoring balance. [Home Health Care for Families ](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Home-Health-Care-for-Families) Taking care of loved ones in the time of a pandemic is more challenging than ever and even more demanding of the caretaker. In this class, we discuss how to include all household members in the planning, expectations and considerations of providing care for family at home. How can we empower and enable those in our communities to provide care with what skills and equipment they have or can easily acquire? Featured in this presentation: Assembling a home first aid kit Demonstration of application of poultices, fomentations and liniments for common conditions First aid repertory of botanicals for common ailments including aches/sprains, allergic reactions, asthma, bleeding, cold and flu, digestive upsets, headache, immune boosters, anti-microbials, insomnia, pain and stress/anxiety What herbs to carry in home herbal apothecary Jill Crista, ND [PANDAS & PANS: Natural Medicine Rescue for Post-Infectious Autoimmune Encephalopathies](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/PANDAS-PANS-Natural-Medicine-Rescue-for-Post-Infectious-Autoimmune-Encephalopathies) Families dealing with PANDAS and PANS (Pediatric Acute-onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome) watch at their children experience a sudden onset of severe neuropsychiatric symptoms following an illness, usually strep. This presentation covers the definition of PANDAS and PANS, symptoms, and diagnostic criteria while outlining the developing understanding of the mechanisms. We include a discussion of lab testing options and limitations, cover the pharmaceuticals usually prescribed, and offer an alternative approach to treatment. Attendees will be able to identify key botanical for addressing multiple mechanisms causing neuropsychiatric symptoms, including berberine, gotu kola, Deborah [Pelvic Decongestant Herbs for Clearing and Grounding ](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Pelvic-Decongestant-Herbs-for-Clearing-and-Grounding) Addressing stagnation of blood, lymph and energy flow through the pelvis is essential for the successful treatment of reproductive conditions in both men and women. Ceanothus, Achillea, Cimicifuga, Gossypium, Foqueria, Nymphaea and many other plants are highlighted in this presentation, with specific indications given to differentiate which of the many herbs available to us is the most suited for each individual as well as the medical condition with which they present. [The Treatment of Intestinal Parasites with Herbs](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/The-Treatment-of-Intestinal-Parasites-with-Herbs) Plants such as wormwood, quassia and black walnut can be highly efficacious in clearing intestinal parasites, even when pharmaceuticals such as metronidazole and ivermectin fail to eradicate infestation. Milder herbs like garlic, pumpkin seed and garden sage can act as supportive and preventive agents. Pulsed dosing of herbs is essential to address encysted forms of parasites. Failure in treating conditions such as giardia, pinworms and even tapeworm with plant medicines is often more related to underdosing than it is to the power of plants. We delve into the plants, dosing strategies and other recommendations for effective treatment. Tori Hudson, ND [Brain Aging in the Menopausal Woman: Effects on Moods, Memory and Botanical Solutions ](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Brain-Aging-in-the-Menopausal-Woman-Effects-on-Moods-Memory-and-Botanical-Solutions) The aging brain in the perimenopausal and postmenopausal woman comes with metabolic changes, neurotransmitter changes, vascular changes and more. All of these changes contribute to the unique role of hormones in moods and memory. Select botanicals have some very important impacts and implications in these changes and have a clinical role in prevention and management. Discussion includes indications and dosages for bacopa, saffron, curcumin, Saint John's wort, gotu kola, among others. Kat Maier, RH (AHG) [A Seasonal Model for Working with Depression](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/A-Seasonal-Model-for-Working-with-Depression) The causes of depression are almost as varied as those who present with this heartbreaking challenge. While hormones and neurotransmitters are a definite part of the puzzle, Chinese Medicine provides us with an amazing lens to view our mental health through the seasons. This class looks at Five Element Theory, how different organ systems and emotions are related to each other, and how they play a significant role in anxiety as well as depression. In Spring, where the element of Wood governs Liver/Gallbladder, we look at hepatic depression, melancholy (black bile) and the emotion of anger that is processed here. Summer is dominated by the Fire Element and we look at nourishing Heart energy through cardiac tonics. Late Summer relates to the Earth element, Stomach/Spleen. We look at the key role our gut biome plays in mental health as well as our ability to 'digest' overwhelming emotions. Fall is the Element of Metal, Lungs/Large Intestine where grief is processed. A large percentage of people with depression actually are manifesting unresolved grief, as our culture does not support this process. Finally, we will look at the energies of Winter, Kidney/Bladder and how adaptogenic herbs support hormonal and neurological functioning to deal with chronic challenges. This is the Water element that processes fear and the health of this Element is crucial for our times. [Deepening Plant Relations - Goethean Study of Nature ](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Deepening-Plant-Relations-Goethean-Study-of-Nature) Natural philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe developed a methodology of working with plants in a scientific manner in which the student enters into the experience of the phenomenon (plant or tree) itself, versus engaging intellectually or in an abstract manner. By approaching a plant with an empty mind and open heart, it is possible to allow the patterns and meaning of a plant to emerge and to understand nature in a truly holistic way. Goethe maintained that this practice, while rigorous, allows for the development of the observer themselves. We will take two fifteen-minute breaks during the class for participants to go outside and practice these exercises. Jason Miller, DACM, LAc [Acute Viral Infections: Addressing COVID and Seasonal Epidemic Disease ](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Acute-Viral-Infections-Addressing-COVID-and-Seasonal-Epidemic-Disease) Long before the advent of the microscope, doctors in China recorded and treated what they called epidemic febrile diseases. Over the past 2000 years, traditional Chinese medicine has catalogued over 300 seasonal epidemic diseases that occur at a rate of about one every 4-6 years. A great deal of information has been compiled about these seasonal challenges, including how they manifest and how to manage them in the collaborative medical setting. In this lecture, we explore the results of months of intense clinical practice, observation, and research into the different types of epidemic diseases, their manifestations, risks, and effective treatment strategies with botanical medicine. In addition to therapies for acute illness, we discuss COVID \"long-haulers,\" pharmaceutical treatments, and vaccines. [Essence, Hormesis and Autophagy in Aging and Longevity ](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Essence-Hormesis-and-Autophagy-in-Aging-and-Longevity) This session explores the ways in which lifestyle and botanical therapies can affect the ability of cells to prevent and repair genetic damage, and how this governs overall health and longevity. We take a deeper look at the TCM perspective on Essence and compare it with the modern genetic theory of aging. We also discuss the role of autophagy in aging, and how xenohormesis plays a key role in improving quality of life and longevity. Although we can't prevent aging or death, with the use of specific botanical and nutritional agents, we can slow the aging process and help our patients age gracefully while adding healthy years to their lives. Kenneth Proefrock, NMD [Naturopathic Formulas and Strategies of the Early 20th Century](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Naturopathic-Formulas-and-Strategies-of-the-Early-20th-Century) This discussion revolves around Dr. OG Carroll, who practiced from 1908 to 1962 in Spokane, Washington and became one of the first practitioners of Naturopathic Medicine in the Western US and one of the most influential Naturopathic Physicians of the past century. His clinical approach was based on the Thomsonian system of healing, which favored a simple vegetarian diet, hydrotherapy, homeopathy, physiotherapy, and botanical medicine. He had the distinction of being one of the busiest practitioners of any school of medicine during the 1930's and 1940's and was said to have a botanical repertoire of 750 herbs. Dr. Carroll's perspective was very instructive to the early days of Naturopathic Medical practice and influenced the modern practice of botanical medicine in a myriad of ways. We discuss his clinical strategies and rationales and how many of them have become part of the modern practice of clinical herbalism. [Vaporizer Technologies: Safety Considerations and a Mechanism for the Delivery of Botanical Medicines](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Vaporizer-Technologies-Safety-Considerations-and-a-Mechanism-for-the-Delivery-of-Botanical-Medicines) The first commercially viable 'e-cigarette' ushered in a whole new industry when it was patented and brought to market in 2003. Over the past 17 years, we have witnessed an explosion of companies with devices that promise a less toxic way to deliver nicotine and cannabinoids to consumers than traditional smoking.

Mary Rondeau, ND, RH (AHG) Naturopathic Therapies](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Restoring-Mitochondrial-Function-through-Botanicals-and-other-Naturopathic-Therapies) Mitochondrial dysfunction is characterized by the reduction of energy output from the electron transport chain. Research confirms that reduced mitochondrial function is associated with nearly all chronic conditions, including neurodegenerative, psychiatric, cardiovascular, metabolic, autoimmune, cancer, chronic immune disorders and musculoskeletal. This lecture covers symptoms that are suggestive of mitochondrial concerns and testing methods to determine treatment strategies.

[Katie Stage, ND, RH (AHG)] Loss and Abnormal Hair Growth](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Hairy-Predicaments-Hair-Loss-and-Abnormal-Hair-Growth) Loss of head hair is both common and concerning for many people. In this session, we explore causes and targeted treatments for various types of head hair loss. We also discuss causes and treatments for hirsutism, or abnormal hair growth on the face and body. Topical botanicals, herbal formulas and nutritional support form the backbone of the recommended treatments. Standard pharmaceutical treatment of male pattern baldness with finasteride and minoxidil are also evaluated. [Embracing the Change: Botanical and HRT Treatments for Menopause](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Embracing-the-Change-Botanical-and-HRT-Treatments-for-Menopause) Not all women experience significant climacteric symptoms during and after the transition to menopause, but for some, symptoms can be persistent and severe. Often, women have strong feelings about the use of natural treatments or HRT (hormone replacement therapy). This session explores both types of treatment, including safety, doses, and applications for specific symptoms such as low libido, painful sex, and \"brain fog\". Jillian Stansbury, ND [Herbs Improve Adrenergic Tone - Lifting Deep Lethargy and Melancholia](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Herbs-to-Improve-Adrenergic-Tone-Lifting-Deep-Lethargy-and-Melancholia) Melancholy has been an integral part of so many lives this last year, often caused by the continual fight or flight effect of epinephrine on the nervous system. Increased adrenergic activity is manifested in tachycardia, diaphoresis, pallor, peripheral cyanosis with pallor, coldness of the extremities and deep fatigue. By toning the adrenergic receptors and damping these responses, these effects can be managed. Herbs can help bring light to a dark situation and offer relief. The therapeutic effects of mimosa, rose, St. John's wort, rhodiola, holy basil and others are investigated, and recommendations on delivery systems and dosages described. [Neural Pathways Review](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Neural-Pathways-Review) This session starts with a review of the basic neurotransmitters, with examples of classic herbal agonists and antagonists. Dopaminergic, serotonergic, cholinergic, adrenergic, and GABAergic pathways will be reviewed along with the most common receptors types and their roles in various mental-emotional states. We conclude this presentation with a discussion of brain plasticity and all the excitement over impending legalization of DMT, psilocybin, and other entheogens to rewire the brain. Marc Williams, MA [Temperate Medicinal Plant Biogeography and Conservation](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Temperate-Medicinal-Plant-Biogeography-and-Conservation) We discuss several of the major medicinal plants growing in the cold areas of the world that are often used in herbalism. We review where these plants originate and the current state of their conservation. The work of United Plant Savers in plant preservation is a major topic of discussion. The need for more cultivation of various species and resources to assess sustainability of harvest will round out our discussion. Examples of some of the plants we discuss include Black Zingiberaceae: A Family Worth Knowing](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/The-Zingiberaceae-A-Family-Worth-Knowing) The Zingiberaceae (or Ginger) family is made up of approximately 50 genera with almost 1600 known species of highly aromatic perennial herbs. Most have lateral roots or fleshy rhizomes and are found growing in South and Southeast Asia, tropical Africa and Central and South America. While some of these plants, especially ginger, turmeric and cardamom, are well-known and used throughout the world, others may only be used regionally. Many more of these plants are used as foods, spices, medicines, dyes, perfumes and as ornamental plants in Indonesia, Malaysia, India, China, the Philippines, Myanmar, Thailand and Laos. Although the phytochemistry of this diverse family of plants differs widely, a great number of Zingiberaceae species are rich in highly active volatile oils and oleoresins. Donald Yance, RH (AHG) [Clinical Applications for Using 13 Heroic and Potentially Toxic Herbs](https://www.botanical-medicine.org/Clinical-Applications-for-13-Heroic-and-Potentially-Toxic-Herbs) Poisonous plants, when used in the proper, prescribed doses, can act as potent therapeutic agents. Virtually any substance can be harmful at high enough concentrations, and it is thought that if the dose is low enough, even a highly toxic substance will cease to cause a harmful effect. The toxic potency of a chemical is thus ultimately defined by the dose (the amount) of the chemical that will produce a specific response in a specific biological system. \"In all of these debates, the key point that is not often understood is that it's the dose that makes the poison,\" says Dr. Carl Winter, an expert in toxicology at the University of California, Davis. \"The tendency is to exaggerate toxicity. It's a slippery slope where to draw the line on what represents a legitimate concern and what restrictions should apply.\" I often combine medicinal plants with powerful actions, such as Digitalis and Belladonna, with those with very gentle action, such as chamomile, lemon balm and many adaptogenic plants. \"Gentle action\", when referring to herbs such as chamomile does not mean they are more or less ineffective, but rather they are plants that either don't produce instant and powerful effects and/or they can be consumed in higher doses without any adverse effects. When I combine powerful herbs with gentle herbs I am looking for the powerful herbs to push a bit in a specific direction while the gentle tonic-like herbs provide the overall therapeutic effect, always in concert with the life-force of the body, lending a helping hand rather than doing all the lifting.
