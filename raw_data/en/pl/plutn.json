In the last 2 years through August 2022, 600 million people have been infected withCOVID-19,andover6millionpeoplehavediedassociated directly or indirectly with COVID-19 worldwide. Before late 2020, due to the lack of prophylactic and eective therapeutic approaches, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were the only option for potentially mitigating pandemic transmission and fatality ( 1). COVID-19 is believed to spread primarily through close contact from person-to-person mainly, utilizing the respiratory route ( 2). Community mitigation strategies following the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US, CDC) recommendations can lower the risk for disease transmission by limiting or preventing person-to- person interactions. The CDC recommended public health NPIs including patients' isolation, close contact quarantine, hand hygiene, social distancing, wearing face coverings when anywhere in public (especially when social distancing is dicult), and monitoring personal health. However, increased mask use in public during COVID-19, along with a global supply shortage, has led to the widespread use of homemade masks and face covering alternatives in 2020 ( 3-5). In conjunction with gowns, gloves, eye protection, and hand washing, the mask is a core component of the personal protective equipment (PPE) that clinicians use when caring for symptomatic patients and that researchers require in the infectious diseases elds ( 6,7). Although, historically, wearing a face mask has been controversial among the general public during previous influenza-like illness seasons, this practice is believed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 because asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 can also spread the virus unknowingly ( 8-11). Because the COVID-19 pandemic is asynchronous and varies in transmission across the US, states dier in whether they require their citizens to follow lockdown or stay-at-home (SAH) orders and/or mandated face masks (MFMs) to limit the spread. Apart from the CDC recommendations, individual states began implementing various community mitigation policies including SAH and MFMordersasofMarch2020. The consequences of combating the pandemic will involve reducing both incidence rates and severity of the disease. However, direct investigations on how COVID-19 mitigation eorts at the policy-making level aected transmission (e.g., incidence rate) and severity [e.g., case-fatality ratios (CFRs)] in the entire population, under the same CDC and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, as well as national standardized healthcare professional practice and hospital systems, are lacking. Any best modeling and randomized, double-blind sampling clinical trials nally have to be applied to the specic or entire population to verify their validity.The purpose of this study was to characterize the relationship between state-level mitigation strategies and COVID-19 consequences around the US that involved all available US pandemic data and the entire population, but by neither modeling (theoretical) nor selecting regional database (i.e., notsampling). Literature review We conducted a literature search for scientic articles published using the available COVID-19 pandemic database in theUStoexaminetherelationshipbetweenNPIs(e.g.,SAHand face covering), and issues of disease transmission and severity. The overall consensus on the importance of public health NPIs for pandemic control, even only in biological vulnerabilities, is still uncertain and controversial, and the study on the eectiveness of NPIs is still limited ( 8,12-14). Many articles characterizing public health strategies either focus on masking models, indirect SAH, and masking data or school closures (15-19). The results suggested that the SAH and MFM orders could help reduce activities associated with the community spread of COVID-19 by limiting or preventing non-familial person-to-person interactions outside the household ( 15,20- 22). These articles were reported using selected andschools'pandemicdatawithpotentialselectionbias,lackof adjustmentforconfounders(e.g.,vaccinesandspecicdrugs),or lack of randomized trials ( 23,24). Only limited articles directly investigated COVID-19 mitigation eorts regarding infection and/or CFR on the entire US pandemic database ( 25,26). These studies indicated potential reductions in the incidence and mortality of COVID-19; however, these readings suggested many limitations, and all results should be interpreted with caution. Recent reports indicated that lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic have had little to no public health eects, including eects on the mortality rate ( 27,28). However, it is very dicult to draw a comprehensive conclusion because various countries have diering lockdown policies, other NPIs, anddisparitiesregardingthequalityandquantityoftheirhealth professionalsandhospitalsystems. Methods Study data Data on COVID-19 cases were collected from CDC provisionalcountsofUnitedStatesCOVID-19casesanddeaths by states over time ( SupplementaryeTables1 -4). On 23 August 2020, there were more than ve million positive cases and close to 170,000 fatalities among 330 million vulnerable populations from the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC) in the USA. Other data sources, such as state health departments and the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, were Frontiersin PublicHealth /zero.tnum/two.tnum frontiersin.orgWu FIGURE/one.tnum Daily trends in number of COVID-/one.tnum/nine.tnum new cases in the US reported t o CDC.

Thehospitalcapacityandhealthprofessionaldatawerecollected fromtheAmericanHospitalAssociationandtheAssociationof AmericanMedicalColleges( 15,29).Dataonstateandterritorial mandatory SAH and MFM orders for the general public were obtained from government websites containing executive or administrativeordersorpressreleases( SupplementaryeTable1 ) (15). Between 21 January 2020 (rst positive case in the US) and 23 August 2020, governors of 35 states and the mayor of Washington DC signed orders mandating all individuals who can medically tolerate the wearing of a face mask to do so in public settings (e.g., public transportation, parks, and grocery stores). This practice applies both indoors and outdoors where maintaining six feet of social distancing might not always be possible. For states with no state-wide mandates (e.g., only for store employees, or only a couple of counties or cities inthe states), we will recognize these states as no-MFM (n =16 states). New Hampshire was counted as a non-MFM state because face coverings are only required for all persons who attendscheduledgatheringsforsocial,spiritual,andrecreational activities of 100 people or more. Between 21 January 2020 and 23 August 2020, 43 states and Washington DC signed orders mandating citizens to stay-at-home or shelter-in-place (seeSupplementaryeTables1 ,2for references on MFM and SAHstatelist)( 15,16). Experimental approach and experimental outcomes TheresearchdesignisaUSpopulation-basedcross-sectional study. This study was designed to evaluate the ecacy of SAH Frontiersin PublicHealth /zero.tnum/three.tnum frontiersin.orgWu and Wu /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpubh./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/four.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum and MFM at the policy-making level during the pandemic. The overall experimental protocol is shown in Figure1. Separated four-state groups were based on their own policies as SAH +MFM states ( n=34), states ( n=1). The two primary outcomes examined are incidence and fatality. To examine the incidence, the incidence rate, positivity rate, and average daily cases were investigated with or without normalization to population density. To examine fatality, the mortality rate (per 100,000 residents), CFR, and average daily death were investigated with or without normalization to population density. Because COVID-19 is recognized as an acute disease, incidence rate or infection rate refers to the occurrence of new cases of COVID-19 in a state's vulnerable population over a specied pandemic period. The pandemic period is from the date of the rst positive case in each state to the date of 23 August 2020, because there were no FDA-approved specic drugs or vaccines available yet. To examine the severity of disease, CFR was investigated as the proportion of people who have died associated directly or indirectly with COVID-19 among all infected over the fatality periods during the pandemic periods from the date of the rst death in each state to 23 August2020.Thestate-levelCOVID-19testingratesandSARS- CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positivity rates were alsoexamined. Statistical analysis We employed an event study, which is similar to a dierence-in-dierences design, to examine whether state-wide mandatedSAHand/ortheuseoffacemasksinpublicaectthe spreadofCOVID-19basedonthestatevariationsnotedearlier. This design allowed us to estimate NPIs' eects in the context of a natural experiment, comparing the changes in COVID-19 spread among the states with mandates to changes in the states that did not pass these mandates, over a period of time. Each state'spopulationdensityisdenedasthenumberofpeopleper squaremileofstatelandarea( Table1). Statistical tests were performed using SAS software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and Origin 2020b (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton, MA). Categorical variables, such as two-peak occurrence (with peak tting), were compared between groups using the Chi-square test (or Fisher exact test). Statistical comparisons of incidence rate and CFR were performed with a one-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) as appropriate. Post-hoc analyses were carried out expressed as the mean \u00b1 standarderror(SE).Results Trends in daily new COVID-/one.tnum/nine.tnum cases in the US decreased due to stay-at-home orders and increased following social gathering events The incubation period was dened as the interval between the potential earliest date of contact with the transmission source, and the potential earliest date of symptom onset or the earliest time a test could give a positive result. The incubation period for COVID-19 was reported to be anywhere from 5 days to 23 days for the original SARS-CoV-2 strain ( 30,31). There were some cause-and-eect phenomena in the curve of Figure1. In the 7-day averaged curve, there was a detectable increase following spring break (late February to early April) andapeakon11April2020( Figure1A ).InFigure1A ,thedaily new cases curve of the nation was flattened about 16 days after SAH (n=43 states) with the rst peak date of 11 April 2020. Six out of 43 SAH states had the peak (or rst peak Table1and Figure1) before the date of 11 April 2020. The second rise of the curve followed 23 days after ending the SAH order during a phased society reopening and 8 days post Memorial Day. The trends increased following nation-wide gathering events during themonthsofMayandJuneandtheJuly4thholiday.Themost recent peak date, or the second peak date, if a state had already peaked around11April2020,was 19days post-July4th,thatis, on 23 July 2020, The overall averaged incidence rate was higher in the SAH +no-MFM states, while overall averaged CFR was signicantlyhigherintheSAH +MFMstates( Table1). The daily new total case ), daily average case curve daily death curve ( Figure1D ) have been shown to bend downward in the group of SAH +MFM states (n=34) and were flattened in the group of SAH +no- MFMstates(n =9)duringSAHperiods.Normalizeddailycase data represented as daily new cases to the case number on day 1 of SAH (i.e., using the same dates as in the SAH groups) in the upper inset of Figure1B , revealed a signicant increase in the trend for new daily cases in the no-SAH +no-MFM states (n=7). The SAH +MFM and SAH +no-MFM states showed 56.5%and57.7%decreases,respectively,indailyinfectiontrends when compared to no-SAH +no-MFM. There were similar daily infection trends between SAH +MFM and SAH +no- MFM states during the SAH period. Normalized daily death represented as daily new deaths to the death in day 1 of SAH in the inset of Figure1D , showed a signicant curve bending downward in the SAH +MFM states. This downward trend could indicate a 61.1% decrease in death numbers in the SAH +MFMstatesduringSAHperiodsalone. Thirteenoutof34SAH +MFMstatesandtwooutofseven no-SAH +no-MFM states had two peaks. Zero out of nine SAH+no-MFM states displayed a second peak ( signicantdierenceinthenumberofdaysfromthedateofthe rst case in each state to the most recent peak between SAH + no-MFM states and no-SAH +no-MFM states ( Table1). Thus, theseresults that SAH helped flatten thetransmission andsavelives. States with stay-at-home orders and mandatory face masks policies have mixed results regarding daily positive cases and fatality during the pandemic periods ToevaluatewhetherSAHandMFMareassociatedwiththe prevention of infection and severity of disease, we investigated thetestingpositivityrate,incidencerate,mortalityrate,andCFR amongeachstategroupduringthepandemicperiod(about171 days until 23 August 2020). There was no signicant dierence in test percentage in the population of the states (24.01 \u00b1 1.48% in SAH +MFM the ( Figure2B ) but was not signicantly to the positivity rate in the no-SAH +no-MFM states. To compare the COVID-19 infected level, the SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity rate from available studies was also examined ( 32). The results indicated that there were no signicant dierences in antibody levels were no signicant dierences in the results of incidence rate among the SAH +MFM (1.42%), SAH + no-MFM states (1.35%) and no signicant dierence in the dates of pandemic periods (Figures2D ,E). However, the SAH +MFM state has a signicantly higher average of daily new cases compared to the no-SAH+no-MFMstate( Figure2F ). To examine whether total positive cases and average daily newcaseswereimpactedbypopulationdensity,weinvestigated total positive cases and the average daily positive cases when normalized with population density. A geographic analysis of population density during the pandemic indicated that population density could be a factor aecting transmission and fatality (33,34). The information regarding state population density (residents/mile2) has also been considered during the analysis ( Table1). There was a signicant dierence in the population density in the groups of the SAH +MFM, SAH +no-MFM, and no-SAH +no-MFM states ( Table1). The SAH+MFM states have a much higher population density when including Washington DC. There were no dierences between total positive cases and the average daily positive cases when normalized with population density among the three groups (Figures2G ,H). These results suggested that SAH and MFM/no-MFMordersprovidedmixedeectsontheprevention ofinfection. To examine whether fatality is impacted by population density, we investigated CFR and the average daily death cases when normalized with population density. When comparing Frontiersin PublicHealth /zero.tnum/five.tnum frontiersin.orgWu and Wu /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpubh./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/four.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum case severity levels without normalizing to the population density, states with SAH +MFM had a 2.7-fold higher states with no-SAH +no-MFM have 4.8% fewer days compared to SAH +MFM and SAH +no-MFM ( p=0.017.Figure3B ). Because longer fatality periods could result in greater death numbers, we also compareddailydeathsamongthreegroups.ThestateswithSAH +MFM or SAH +no-MFM had 9.53-fold ( p<0.05) or higher averages of daily death than no-SAH +no-MFM states,respectively.Whentotaldeathswerenormalizedwiththe population (per 100,000 residents) as mortality rates, the SAH +MFM (3.0-fold, p<0.05) and SAH +no-MFM (2.0-fold) states had than the no-SAH +no-MFM states (Figure3D ). When CFR was normalized by population density, the no-SAH +no-MFM states had a signicantly higher CFR when compared to SAH +MFM states (p = 0.033.Figure3E ). However, there was no signicant dierence in average daily fatality per population density among the three groups ( Figure3F ). These results suggested that SAH and MFM/no-MFMordersprovidedmixedoutcomesforprotection ontheseverityofthedisease. The state of Arkansas (22.2% testing percentage) issued a MFM order without a SAH order (as the fourth group, only one state) and was excluded from the three state groups above. Varied results indicated an 8.4% antigen testing positivity rate and a 1.87% incidence rate, which were similar to SAH MFMstates.Inaddition,whencomparingMFMstates( n=34) with all SAH, there were no signicant dierences in the incidence rate and CFR (datanotshown). States with MFM policies have not shown preventive eects on the incidence or average daily cases during mandatory SAH order periods To examine whether SAH overlapping with MFM order (yellow rectangle box in the lower part of Figure1A ) demonstrated improved preventive eects, we examined the incidence rate along with daily new cases during the SAH window (averaged about 45 days. n=43 states). The average overlapping period for SAH and MFM was 28 \u00b13 days, which wasabout50%ofoverallSAHdays.TheincidencerateinMFM states (n=12) was signicantly higher than that in no-MFM states (n=31.p=0.003.Figure4A ) during periods. BecausethenumberofSAHdaysinMFMstateswas23%longer than in no-MFM states ( Figure4B ), which could increase the positive cases data, we examined the average daily new cases between the two groups during the SAH periods. The averagedaily new positive cases in MFM states was 4-fold higher than theno-MFMstates( p=0.004Figure4C ). We examined total positive cases and average daily new casesinrelationtopopulationdensity.Therewerenosignicant dierencesinthenumberoftotalpositivecases( Figure4D )and average daily cases ( Figure4E ) impacted by population density betweenMFMandno-MFMstates.Thus,theseresultssuggested that the MFM policy during the SAH period may not have had anadvantageovertheno-MFMpolicy. Discussion This study is the rst report to evaluate all available COVID-19 positive cases and fatality data in the US, without utilizing theoretical modeling or selected regional databases, from the policy-making levels during the pandemic periods until 23 August 2020. The key strengths of this article include that there were no specic drugs or vaccines that were participated or nished in large scale phase III clinical trials prior to August 2020 with the original SARS-CoV- 2 strain (reference in vaccine and treatment information section in SupplementaryeTable1 ). According to the health department reporting system, patients were only counted one time for incidence during the early phase of the pandemic. This pandemic marks the rst time in history that diagnostic testing is provided for free to the general public without a physician's order. The free test was included in all hospital admission and death coding procedures. Our separated four- state groups were based on their own policies under CDC and FDA guidelines (no researcher selection bias) and were unique, that is, one country including four possible combinations of SAH and MFM policies. Thus, the analysis of SAH and MFM eectiveness in each individual group will have fewer confoundingvariablesthanwhencomparingdierentcountries, as these four groups are a part of the same nation with national standardized healthcare professional practice and hospitalsystems. Our results were inconsistent with the intent of state- level public health strategies in lowering overall infection rates and fatality. This study provided direct evidence of potential decreased infection and fatality in SAH +MFM and SAH +no-MFM states during SAH periods ( Figure1). There were also potential decreases in testing the positivity rate when comparing the SAH +MFM to SAH +no- MFM groups and a decrease of fatality rate to potentially save lives when normalized by population density through strategies of the SAH +MFM orders during the COVID- 19 pandemic ( Figure3). However, the no-SAH +no-MFM group had a lower incidence rate, average daily news cases, CFR, and mortality rates ( Figures2,3andTable1). There is no signicant dierence in SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody positivity rates among the three groups.

Pathogenesis is the process by which an infection leads to either asymptomatic or symptomatic signs of that disease. Theoretically, this process is always a balance between viral invasion (i.e., enough quality-virulence factors, quantity-virus load, and contact time with contagious source-15min as the CDC estimated) and human defense (i.e., physical and mentalhealth). Before vaccines and specic drugs are available, what we can do from a prevention standpoint is to hinder the pathogen from reaching the sucient virus load by using non-pharmaceutical physical barriers such as face coverings and hand hygiene, and to reduce contact time through the isolation of patients, SAH, social distancing and decreasing exposure to unknown crowds ( 6,7,35-37).

Available COVID-19 vaccines with FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)orapprovalcontainviralDNA,mRNA,andproteins,and can help boost the human immune defense system (preventive andprotectiveeorts)bytheendoftheyear2020( 38).However, people who are vaccinated may still contract COVID-19 from immune escape, especially with coronavirus mutations/variants that are referred to as breakthrough infection (CDC4 and 5 inSupplementaryeTable1 ) (39,40). It is recognized that breakthrough cases who are vaccinated are much less likely to experience severe illness and hospitalization than unvaccinated people. Around the US, federal and state governments have been ghting the COVID-19 pandemic through a variety of strategies with the assistance of predictive modeling. These strategies include testing to nd patients, isolating patients (preemptive ), controlling transmission ( preventive ), and nallyproviding necessary clinical care when needed ( protective and personalcare ). The rst step is to nd the contagious source\u2014the patients. Freetestingiscriticalinthepublichealtheld'smitigationeorts because it helps investigators to characterize the incidence rate, spread, and contagiousness of the disease. Early testing helps identify anyone who encounters an infected person so they too can be quickly quarantined, isolated, and then treated if needed.Thesoonerpatientsreceivetheirtestresults,thesooner infected individuals can be isolated before transmitting their infection to others. Among all three with or without SAH and MFM states, the testing percentages, SARS-CoV-2 antigen, and antibody positivity rates, and total COVID-19 positive cases per population density had no signicant and voluntary quarantine of close contactors followed by contact tracing and free society support services, etc. Health care, including public health and medicine, is both a science and an art. For communicable diseases, no contact will mean no contagion (Science aspect). This is the most important preemptive step because better control of a contagious source will greatly reduce transmission in the community, thereby reducing the positivity rate, incidence rate, and fatality in the community ( 41,42). It has been reported that about 30-62% of patients were only partially isolated or not isolated at all ( 43). If self-isolating or self-quarantining (Science aspect) at home is not possible, local governments or communities could provide designated places with free living support and rewards for close contacts and positive cases whose vital signs are stable (Art aspect).Inaddition,onebigshortcomingoftheUS'responseto thecoronaviruspandemic,atleastinsomepartsofthecountry, involvesashortageofcontacttracersandeectivenessofcontact tracing(44-47).Whennewdailycasesreachacertainlevel(such as200/dayinHoustonArea,TX),itisverydiculttoeectively trace and help isolate the further spread of the virus (TMC in SupplementaryeTable1 ). The third step of this strategy is preventive transmission control through the CDC recommendations of hand washing often, maintaining good social distancing, wearing a face coveringwhenaroundothersifnotvaccinated,andmonitoring your health daily (self-awareness). These NPIs were very important preventive parts in the early pandemic when no vaccines and drugs were available. During influenza-like-illness season, including the COVID-19 outbreak before April 2020, the CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) did not recommend face masks to the general public because there was noevidencefromclinicaltrialsoftheireectivenessinreducing transmission( 8,13).However,theCDCrecommendsusingface masksinpublicifyouaresick,takingcareofasickpatient,have underlyingconditionssuchasimmunocompromisedpersonsor have to be in a crowded environment. As COVID-19 continues its global spread, the WHO and CDC recommended that it was possible these strategies in pandemic control, such as face masks, might at least help reduce the severity of the disease and ensure that a greater proportion of new positive cases are asymptomatic infections ( 37,48,49). Furthermore, rejecting a low-cost intervention such as mass masking as ineective, because there is no evidence of ecacy in clinical trials, is potentially detrimental ( 50). Our data indicated that SAH and MFMinthegeneralpubliccouldhelpwithmitigation,andeven save lives during the COVID-19 pandemic as shown in the part of our data in Figures1-3with population density, and in the balance of pathogenesis as mentioned above ( 22,51). Several studiesfoundareductioninthespreadofCOVID-19afterstay- at-home, school closure, and social distancing mandates were enacted in most cities and states ( 15-19,52,53). The national overall daily new cases curve was consistent with these reports.There were several signicant cause-and-eect relationships in the daily case trend curve ( Figure1). The daily new case and death curve trends were bent downward, indicating decreased transmissionandfatality,followingamandatedshort-termSAH order (weeks. Average 45 days). However, it is possible that the economic and non-economic consequences of the long-term SAHordersoutweightheneedtoprotectpublichealth( 27,54- 57).WhenUSstatesbeganphasedreopeningoftheireconomies, andcommunitiesstartedgathering,thedailynewcasesobserved anupwardsurge.Thissuggestedtheecacyofshort-termSAH and social distancing measures which could influence future public health policy-making ( 18,52). However, the pandemic results indicated that there was no signicant dierence among the three groups in positivity rates and incidence rates during thepandemicperiods. The impact of population density on emerging highly contagiousinfectiousdiseaseshasrarelybeenstudied.Intheory, dense areas over a certain threshold level could lead to more closeinteractionsamongresidents,whichmakesthempotential hotspots for the rapid spread of diseases. Moreover, dense cities may have better access to healthcare systems ( 33,34). Our research design for the current COVID-19 pandemic is an apt population-based cross-sectional study to investigate these relationships. Our data indicated that the top eight states in population densities are in the SAH +MFM group with high average daily new cases, mortality, CFR, and average daily fatality. However, after being normalized with population density, there were no signicant dierences in daily new cases and average daily fatality among the three groups during the pandemic periods ( Figures2,3), as well as between MFM and no-MFM groups during SAH periods ( Figure4). Many results in this study were inconsistent with the goals of preventive protocol, including SAH and MFM, to combat the pandemic and to reduce both infection rate and severity of the disease. A limitation of this study was its focus on the dierence in state- level policies. To nd out why SAH and MFM orders did not show signicant changes in infection and fatality, we may need analysisofindividualcountyorcitysocioeconomicdata,patient isolatingdata,contacttracingdata,healthcaresystemsdata,and law enforcement eorts during these mandating requirements (seelimitationssection). Recent studies indicated that not all face masks have equal ecacy in reducing the transmission of particles or droplets, those most likely involved in COVID-19 people- to-people transmission ( 3,5). Among all laboratory-tested masks, tted N95 with other necessary PPE, used by health professionals who take care of patients with COVID-19, performedthebest(Scienceaspect).Three-layersurgicalmasks, used by professionals in the hospital and clinical settings, also showed preferable results. Some mask alternatives, such as neck fleeces or bandanas, oer very little protection ( 3,58). From a public policy perspective, during a pandemic like the COVID-19 pandemic, shortages in the supply of surgical face Frontiersin PublicHealth /one.tnum/zero.tnum frontiersin.orgWu and Wu /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpubh./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/four.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum FIGURE/five.tnum US hospital capacity during the COVID-/one.tnum/nine.tnum pandemic.

From the numbers in this chart, it is possible th at individual hospitals might have the shortage of beds or respira tory therapists. However, there are sucient hospital capacities for patients w ith COVID-/one.tnum/nine.tnum during the pandemic period before the September /two.tnum /zero.tnum/two.tnum/zero.tnum. masks and N95 respirators, as well as concerns about side eects and the discomfort of prolonged use of the masks, have led to the public use of a variety of solutions which are generally less restrictive and usually of unknown ecacy (SupplementaryeTable5 ). When healthcare workers encounter patients with COVID-19, based on CDC recommendations, they normally need PPEs including N95 after t-test, gloves, room with negative pressure, and even head-to-toe isolation gowns. It has been reported that because of the shortage of PPEsduringtheearlyphaseofthepandemic,healthcareworkers had a higher risk of infection of COIVD-19 before September 2020 (59,60). In our opinion, if contagious patients do not strictly isolate themselves in the designated places and stay away from the rest of the community, and if the general public is not informed of the correct types of masks (e.g., N95. Science aspect) with free of charge at all entrances (Art aspect), proper methods to wear a mask, and willing to properly social distance ( 3,5), the community transmission will most likely be inevitable. The similar positivity rates of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and antibody, and incidence rate among three groups indicatedcompromised eectiveness of MFM and/or SAH strategies duringthepandemicperiods( 61). The fourth and last step of this strategy is to provide protectiveclinicalcareandpreventoverwhelmingthehealthcare system during the pandemic. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities play a critical role in national and local responses to COVID-19. Until June 2022, three vaccines and three antiviral treatmentshavebeenapproved(orEUA)withdebatablebenet- risk assessment by FDA ( 62-64). However, the lone healthcare strategies were only supportive care solutions and the ability to manage underlying conditions (protective and personalized care) before September 2020. When mitigation steps are compromised, as our data from the COVID-19 pandemic has indicated, the nal step is to ensure that we have sucient healthcare capacity, especially the capacity of the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with COVID-19 need rooms with negative pressure (e.g., ICU) to prevent contamination to the outside andneedventilatorsbecauseoftherespiratoryissuesassociated with the disease. How do we dene the hospital capacity with the society safety threshold and tightening threshold needed to Frontiersin PublicHealth /one.tnum/one.tnum frontiersin.orgWu and Wu /one.tnum/zero.tnum./three.tnum/three.tnum/eight.tnum/nine.tnum/fpubh./two.tnum/zero.tnum/two.tnum/two.tnum./nine.tnum/nine.tnum/zero.tnum/four.tnum/zero.tnum/zero.tnum handle a potential outbreak demand during phased reopening (52)? The CDC does not have clear recommendations yet. In Texas, if patients with COVID-19 made up <15% of all hospitalizations,anincreaseinreopeningcapacityevery14days was permitted (Texas reopening in SupplementaryeTable1 ) before the year 2021. The hospital capacity data in Figure5 indicate that there was sucient healthcare capacity to take care of patients with COVID-19 in most of the nation based on Texas's 15% suggestion before October 2020. In addition, there are 900,000 active licensed physicians including at least 70,000 physicians specializing in the emergency room, intensive care unit, and respiration ( 29,65). Moreover, there are approximately 3 million nurses and 129,000 respiratory therapists available in the US ( Figure5). The mitigation steps mightbeappropriatelytightenedorloosenedtominimizesocial and economic disruption following the balance among patient's privacy, vulnerable populations' safety, people's freedom, and lawenforcementfollowinghospitalcapacitychanges. Limitations This study has several limitations that other public health studiesmightalsobefacedwhenstudiesinvolveallpopulations. First, these results were limited to the state policy levels under one CDC guideline. We did not consider data on state-wide school closure, non-essential business closure, and county-level MFM orders in no-MFM states, such as those in the state of Florida. Second, we only examined conrmed COVID-19 provisional cases and reported death cases until 23 August 2020. The reported cases and fatality data can lag. There is evidencebytheCDCofahigherinfectionrateinthecommunity than what is reflected in the number of conrmed COVID-19 cases, especially in asymptomatic patients. In addition, we did not examine the percentage of patients who died with the do- not-resuscitate status that could be responsible for increased mortality. Third, we did not examine covariates (possible confounders), such as socioeconomic and demographic factors (e.g., age, sex, and education level), enforcement of the mandates, percentage of comorbidity population in nursing homes and assisted living facilities between states. Those with higherproportionsofminorityresidentsaremorelikelytohave moreCOVID-19cases( 66,67). Conclusion This study is the fact of the COVID-19 pandemic in a real-world population that any so-called successful modeling studies and controlled clinical trials will be challenged when translating into practice. The results provided direct evidence of potential decreases in infection and fatality with short- term SAH order ( Figure1). There was a decrease in fatality rate (more saved lives) when normalized to population density through strategies of SAH +MFM orders. However, overall,many results in this study were inconsistent with the intent of state-level public health strategies of short-term SAH and long-term MFM orders in lowering transmission and fatality. As states began to reopen following October 2020, there were multiple huge upward waves of COVID-19 cases even though three more states enforced MFM policies from November 2020 to January 2021, and the vaccinated population increased and multiple anti-COVID-19 drugs were approved through August 2022 (CDC1 in SupplementaryeTable1 ). From the policy- making level, if contagious patients would not likely be placed in strict isolation and massive contact tracing would not be eective to implement, we presume that following the CDC recommendationswithclosemonitoringofhealthcarecapacity, should no individual state-level policies be required, could be appropriate in helping mitigate the COVID-19 disaster and limiting collateral socioeconomic damage. Mass vaccination to reach herd immunity, along with other public health measures couldbeoneofthemostecientwaystodiminishthepandemic (68-72). With the world facing an unprecedented threat, we must learn the lessons of this pandemic now and ensure that our response is based on vulnerable patients, people's freedom, communityrisk,andhospitalcapacitytomaketheworldasafer placeinpotentialfuturepandemics.
