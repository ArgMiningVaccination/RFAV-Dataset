A medicine protocol involves the authorisation of the nurse/midwife to supply and administer a medicine to groups of patients in a defined situation meeting specific criteria and who may not be individually identified before presentation for treatment. An individually named prescription is not required for the supply and administration of medication when a medication protocol is in effect\" (An Bord Altranais, 2007). The HSE has developed this medicines protocol to facilitate the delivery of COVID19 immunisation in line with NIAC recommendations, Department of Health (DoH) and HSE policy. The professional groups and students using this protocol must ensure that the protocol is organisationally authorised by an appropriate authorising person, related to the professional or student cohort of vaccinators by whom the vaccine is to be administered, including requirements of registration, education, training and assessment of competency.

Circumstances in which the medicine protocol applies Targeted immunisation programme for vaccine recipients against COVID19 as identified in the DoH policy based on the NIAC recommendations. The World Health Organisation declared COVID19 outbreak as a pandemic on 11th March 2020 which is still ongoing. Inclusion criteria for vaccine recipient using the medicine protocol Inclusion Criteria: Individuals aged 18 years and older who have a contraindication or clinical precaution to a nonmRNA vaccine and to Nuvaxovid if they have made an informed decision based on their understanding of the risk of developing thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) compared with the consequences of COVID19 infection. Precautions: Acute severe febrile illness defer until recovery Advice from a relevant specialist should be sought for a person with a history of an immediate severe allergic reaction to multiple drug classes with no identified allergen, any other vaccine injected antibody preparation or medicine likely to contain polysorbate 80 or idiopathic anaphylaxis and the risks should be weighed against the benefits of vaccination. Vaccination should be deferred until clinical recovery from COVID19 at least four weeks after diagnosis or onset of symptoms, or four weeks from the first PCR positive specimen in those who are asymptomatic Vaccination is not contraindicated for those with persisting symptoms post COVID19 unless there is evidence of recent clinical deterioration Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP) with Jcovden COVID19 vaccine ITP is a condition in which the immune system mistakenly targets blood cells called platelets that are needed for normal blood clotting. It can cause bleeding and can sometimes be fatal. Very few cases of ITP have occurred after Jcovden COVID19 vaccine. It has usually occurred within 4 weeks of vaccination and will be added as a side effect for Jcovden COVID 19 vaccine (frequency unknown). If an individual has a history of thrombocytopenic disorder, the risk of developing low platelet levels such as ITP should be considered before vaccination, and platelet monitoring is recommended after vaccination with Jcovden COVID19 vaccine for an individual who has a history of ITP. Individuals with a bleeding disorder or receiving anticoagulant therapy may develop haematomas in IM (intramuscular) injection sites. Prior to vaccination, inform the recipient about this risk. For those with thrombocytopenia (platelet count <50 x 109/ml) consult the supervising consultant HSE National Immunisation Office I 20th April 2023 Those with inherited coagulopathies who require factor replacement therapy should receive it on the day of vaccination, prior to the IM vaccination. If there is uncertainty about the need for cover, contact the patient's Comprehensive Care Centre COVID19 vaccines and other vaccines may be administered at the same time or at any interval. As it is not known if COVID19 vaccine reactogenicity is increased with coadministration, vaccines should preferably be given in different limbs. Patients with planned immunosuppressive therapy should ideally receive the vaccine two weeks before treatment Pregnancy: Pregnant women should be offered an mRNA vaccine Breastfeeding: There is no known reason for vaccine recipients to avoid breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mothers should be vaccinated according to their risk grouping. Exclusion criteria for vaccine recipient using the medicine protocol Jcovden COVID19 vaccine should not be given under this medicine protocol if the vaccine recipient has: Past anaphylaxis (serious systemic allergic reaction requiring medical intervention) to any of its constituents (including polysorbate 80). Anaphylaxis following another viral vector vaccine. Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (TTS) after the first dose of another viral vector COVID19 vaccine A history of capillary leak syndrome Actions to be taken for those who are excluded from the medicine protocol Refer to/discuss with the relevant Medical Practitioner/Clinical lead/Lead vaccinator for an individual medical assessment Document action in clinical record or IT System Where Jcovden COVID19 vaccine is prescribed following medical assessment, the vaccinator may administer the vaccine within his/her scope of practice. Note: In determining their scope of practice, vaccinators must make judgements about their competency to carry out a role or activity in accordance with the guidance from their regulator. Action to be followed for vaccine recipients who do not wish to receive the vaccine Advise of the risks of not having the vaccine, including risk of possible severe COVID19 disease. Advise regarding minimisation of risk Description of circumstances and referral arrangements when further advice or consultation is required Refer to/discuss with relevant Medical Practitioner/Clinical lead/lead vaccinator if the vaccine recipient had previous adverse reaction or other clinical concerns as outlined in exclusion criteria.

HSE National Immunisation Office I 20th April 2023 4.0 Information for vaccine recipient Advice to be given to the vaccine recipient before treatment Vaccine Information material must be supplied to the vaccine recipient prior to administration of the vaccine. Before Treatment Check and confirm that consent has been obtained Discuss the Jcovden COVID19 vaccine and the importance of protecting their health. Inform vaccine recipient that patient information leaflet is available online at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product information/jcovden previously covid19vaccinejansseneparproductinformation_en.pdf Discuss potential side effects as below. Side effects may occur with following frequencies: Local: Very common: injection site pain Common: injection site erythema, swelling General : Very common: fatigue, myalgia, nausea arthralgia, chills, cough, asthenia, back hyperhidrosis, malaise, muscular weakness, oropharyngeal pain, pain in extremity, Myelitis A combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been observed very rarely following vaccination with Jcovden COVID19 vaccine. This includes severe cases presenting as venous thrombosis, including unusual sites such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, splanchnic vein thrombosis, as well as arterial thrombosis, concomitant with thrombocytopenia. The majority of these cases occurred within the first fourteen days following vaccination. Recipients of Jcovden COVID19 vaccine should be instructed to seek prompt medical assistance and mention recent vaccination if they have any of the following in the weeks after receiving Jcovden COVID19 vaccine\u00ae breathlessness, pain in the chest or stomach, swelling or coldness in leg, severe or worsening headache or blurred vision after vaccination, HSE National Immunisation Office I 20th April 2023 persistent bleeding, multiple small bruises, reddish or purplish spots, or blood blisters under the skin Additionally, anyone with neurological symptoms including severe or persistent headaches (particularly 3 or more days after vaccination) blurred vision, seizures or mental status changes or who develops petechiae or ecchymoses beyond the site of vaccination, should seek prompt medical attention. Capillary leak syndrome is now listed as a very rare side effect of Jcovden COVID19 vaccine. Recipients should be advised so seek medical attention if they have the following symptoms in the days after vaccination, which may be associated with feeling faint (due to low blood pressure): oedema in the extremities sudden weight gain. GuillainBarr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) has been reported as a very rare side effect following vaccination with Jcovden COVID19 vaccine. Recipients should be advised to seek medical attention if they develop symptoms including : double vision or difficulty moving eyes difficulty swallowing, speaking, or chewing coordination problems and unsteadiness difficulty walking tingling sensations in the hands and feet weakness in the limbs, chest or face problems with bladder control and bowel function. Healthcare professionals should be alert of GBS signs and symptoms to ensure correct diagnosis, in order to initiate adequate supportive care and treatment, and to rule out other causes. Rare cases of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) VTE (which is different from TTS or Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia syndrome) was added as a rare (frequency >1/10,000 to <1/1,000) side effect of Jcovden COVID19 vaccine based on data from clinical trials and post marketing surveillance. Healthcare professionals and individual receiving the vaccine should be aware of this risk, especially in those who may have an increased risk of VTE. A full list of adverse reactions may be found in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), available at https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product information/jcovden previously covid19vaccinejansseneparproductinformation_en.pdf HSE National Immunisation Office I 20th April 2023 Advice to be given to the recipient after treatment After Treatment Discuss potential side effects Following administration of the vaccine, the vaccine recipient should be advised to remain seated in the post vaccination observation area to enable monitoring of any immediate reaction including suspected anaphylactic reaction. Events of anaphylaxis have been reported therefore NIAC recommends the following monitoring for the postvaccination period: Post vaccination observation period Vaccine recipients: 15 minutes Those with a history of mastocytosis: 30 minutes Those with immediate itching, swelling or urticarial reaction at the vaccination site: 30 minutes or longer as clinically indicated The vaccine recipient should not leave the healthcare facility if they are feeling unwell and must report any side effects to a member of the vaccination team.
