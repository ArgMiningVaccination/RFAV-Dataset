Last month, UMSOM faculty in the Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health (CVD) launched a new clinical trial to investigate the use of mRNA technologies to create a vaccine against malaria. CVD Director Kathleen M. Neuzil, MD, MPH, FIDSA also provided commentary in the nation's leading medical journal on the feasibility of using mRNA to develop a universal influenza vaccine that could eliminate the need for seasonal shots.

Up until now, no one could predict why these treatments sometimes failed to help restore healthy bacteria in the colon. Researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine's (UMSOM) Institute for Genome Sciences (IGS) have discovered important clues that could lead more personalized approaches to optimize treatment success. They published their findings in Cell Reports Medicine online earlier this month.
