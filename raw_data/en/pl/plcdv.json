BeforepregnancyBefore becoming pregnant, a woman should be up-to-date on routine adult vaccines. This will help protect her and her child. Live vaccines should be given a month or more before pregnancy. Inactivated vaccines can be given before or during pregnancy, if needed. Duringpregnancy Did you know that a mother's immunity is passed along to her baby during pregnancy? This will protect the baby from some diseases during the first few months of life until the baby can get vaccinated.Flu Vaccine It is safe, and very important, for a pregnant woman to receive the inactivated flu vaccine. A pregnant woman who gets the flu is at risk for serious complications and hospitalization. To learn more about preventing the flu, visit the CDC website www.cdc.gov/flu . Tdap Vaccine Women should get adult tetanus, diphtheria and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) during each pregnancy. Ideally, the vaccine should be given between 27 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Travel Many vaccine-preventable diseases, rarely seen in the United States, are still common in other parts of the world. A pregnant woman planning international travel should talk to her health professional about vaccines. Information about travel vaccines can be found at CDC's traveler's health website at www.cdc.gov/travel . Childhood Vaccines Pregnancy is a good time to learn about childhood vaccines. Parents-to-be can learn more about childhood vaccines from the CDC parents guide and from the child and adolescent vaccination schedules. This information can be downloaded and printed at www.cdc.gov/vaccines . After pregnancyIt is safe for a woman to receive routine vaccines right after giving birth, even while she is breastfeeding. A woman who has not received the new vaccine for the prevention of tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap) should be vaccinated right after delivery. Vaccinating a new mother against pertussis (whooping cough) reduces the risk to her infant too. Also, a woman who is not immune to measles, mumps and rubella and/or varicella (chicken pox) should be vaccinated before leaving the hospital. If inactivated influenza vaccine was not given during pregnancy, a woman should receive it now because it will protect her infant. LAIV may be an option.
