The purpose of the report is to help the Congress adopt authorizing legislation that should be in place before it considers the 13 regular appropriation bills for fiscal year 1997 (which begins October 1,1996). Ordinarily, this annual report shows the total amount that the Congress has appropriated for programs whose authorization has expired. For fiscal year 1996, however, complete information on appropriations is available only for programs funded in the seven appropriation acts enacted in the first session of the 104th Congress. For programs ordinarily funded in the six appropriation bills not yet enacted, appropriation information is unavailable. That fact is noted in the appen- dixes. Because of the incomplete state of appropriation data at the time this report goes to press, all figures relating to total unauthorized appropriations\u2014both in the tables and in the text of the report\u2014are omitted. Ellen Hays of CBO's Special Studies Division prepared this report under the supervision of Robert Hartman and Marvin Phaup. The author acknowledges the assistance of analysts in CBO's Budget Analysis Division and numerous committee staff members. Christian Spoor edited the report, and Marlies Dunson and Rae Roy prepared it for publication. Questions about the report should be directed to Ellen Hays at (202) 226-2616. June E. O'Neill Director January 1996 OVERVIEW The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 requires the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to report to the Congress each year on unauthorized appropriations and expiring authorizations. Section 221(b) of that act added the following requirement to section 202(f) of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, as amended: (3) On or before January 15 of each year, the Director, after consultation with the appropriate com- mittees of the House and the Senate, shall submit to the Congress a report listing (A) all programs and activities funded during the fiscal year ending Sep- tember 30 of that calendar year for which author- izations for appropriations have not been enacted for that fiscal year, and (B) all programs and activities for which no authorizations for appropriations have been enacted for the fiscal year beginning October 1 of that calendar year. The conference report on the Balanced Budget Act states that the purpose of the requirement is \"to help Congress use the early months of the year to adopt authorizing legislation that must be in place before the thirteen regular appropriation bills can be considered.\" The substance of this report consists of two appendixes. Appendix A specifies programs that have received an appropriation for fiscal year 1996 but whose authorization has expired. Appendix B lists programs whose authorization will expire by the end of fiscal year 1996. The appendixes reflect all public laws enacted during the first session of the 104th Congress that have any effect on authorizations of appropriations. (That information is maintained in CBO's Legislative Classification System.) The Congress addressed the issue of unauthorized appropriations when it adopted rules at the beginning of the 104th session in January 1995. Both House and Senate rules require that the subcommittees of the Committee on Appropri- ations list in their respective committee reports all programs funded in the bill that UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 2 currently lack an authorization. The information in the committee reports differs somewhat from the information shown in this report. This report covers programs that at one time had an explicit authorization that either has expired or will expire. Unlike the lists shown in the Appropriations Committee reports, CBO's report does not include programs that the Congress has never authorized. For example, some Treasury Department programs have never received explicit authorizations of appropriations. (Appropriations are provided for Treasury programs nonetheless because the authority to obligate and spend funds is considered \"organic11\u2014inherent in the legislation or executive action that originally empowered a particular entity to perform a particular function.) Many laws set up programs with authorizations of appropriations that do not expire, whether they be for specific annual dollar amounts or for \"such sums as are necessary.\" Both the committee reports and this CBO report exclude programs with that type of authorization because its effect is permanent For all appropriated programs that at one time had an explicit authorization of appropriations that has expired or will expire, the appendixes show the number and name of the public law containing the last authorization, the last year the authorization was in effect, and the amount authorized in that year. If the authorization provided for \"such sums as are necessary,\" the report shows the amount as \"indefinite.\" PROGRAMS FUNDED IN FISCAL YEAR 1996 WITHOUT SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS Appendix A summarizes programs and activities that have received a fiscal year 1996 appropriation even though their authorization has expired (and had not been renewed at the time this report went to print). The appendix is organized by public law and shows the last funding level authorized and the last fiscal year for which the authori- zation was in effect. If the applicable fiscal year 1996 appropriation act (or its legislative history) provided an explicit funding level for the program, that amount is shown under \"Unauthorized 1996 Appropriatioa\" When no explicit amount is provided (as when a small program is funded at an unidentified level in a large appropriation account), CBO contacts the executive agency's budget office to obtain the amount allocated for the program. If information is not available from either of those sources, the appendix simply notes that a specific dollar amount is not available. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the amounts appropriated for fiscal year 1996 for programs and activities that lack authorizations by House and Senate authorizing committees, respectively. The largest amounts of 1996 appropriations lacking UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 3 authorization were provided in the defense and military construction appropriation acts. The President vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1996 (H.R. 1530), and Congress did not override the veto. Therefore, appropriations provided for programs authorized in H.R. 1530 are displayed as unauthorized and appear under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995 (Public Law 103-337) in Appendix A.

UNAUTHORIZED APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPIRING AUTHORIZATIONS 5 AUTHORIZATIONS OF APPROPRIATIONS EXPIRING BETWEEN JANUARY 15,1996, AND SEPTEMBER 30,1996 Appendix B summarizes programs and activities whose authorizations of appro- priations will expire between January 15 and September 30,1996. The list indicates, by public law, the amounts authorized to be appropriated for expiring programs and activities. Tables 3 and 4 summarize, by House and Senate authorizing committee, the number of laws with expiring authorizations under each committee's jurisdiction and the amounts authorized for fiscal year 1996. The largest expiring authorization is the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 (Public Law 103-305), which authorized $10.3 billion for 1996.
