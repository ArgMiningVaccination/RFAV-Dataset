Together, we are working to end this pandemic. As long as the virus is spreading anywhere, it's a threat to people everywhere, including Americans here at home. Together we will lead the world out of this pandemic. That's why the United States will continue to catalyze political momentum and enhance coordination to close gaps in the global COVID-19 response.

Governments and the private sector made pledges to provide more than $300 million in financial contributions, millions of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine doses to be shared through COVAX, and other in-kind assistance. Discover More Global Vaccine Sharing The United States is leading the world in donating vaccines in partnership with COVAX, the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust, and Caricom. Our principles for sharing U.S. vaccines include achieving broad global coverage; responding to surges and other urgent situations and public health needs; and responding to as many country requests as possible, including our neighbors. We are sharing vaccines as a continuation of our decades-long work to promote global public health and security. Our work on a vaccine supply framework is guided by a three-part approach. First, after having successfully secured enough vaccine supply for Americans, we donated surplus U.S. vaccine supply and encouraged other countries with surplus supplies to do the same. Second, we worked with U.S. vaccine manufacturers to significantly increase vaccine supply for the rest of the world. Third, we are working with our international partners, investment entities, pharmaceutical companies, and other manufacturers to create the kind of global vaccine production and manufacturing capacity and capabilities that can not only continue to combat COVID-19, but also help prepare the world to respond to potential future threats. The United States will continue to donate safe and effective doses to countries and economies around the world. We are also supporting demand creation, distribution, and administration of vaccines through [Global Vax](https://www.usaid.gov/coronavirus/fact-sheets). Safety and Efficacy Getting vaccinated will help keep you, your family, and your community healthy and safe. Vaccines will help bring this pandemic to an end. Visit [vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/) for more information. The United States and our partners adhere to internationally accepted scientific standards for stringency and transparency in clinical trials, which are critical for maintaining public trust in the safety and efficacy of vaccines. The U.S. government continues to monitor vaccine safety and efficacy even after vaccines are authorized for use by our Food and Drug Administration. We continue to encourage the World Health Organization (WHO) and all foreign governments to rigorously assess all vaccines for safety, efficacy, and good manufacturing practices before, during, and after deployment. Multilateral Approach to Beating the Pandemic As President Biden has made clear, the United States supports multilateral approaches and is working as a partner to address global challenges. Alongside our G7+ partners, the United States and its allies committed to providing more than 2 billion vaccines for the world. Drawing on our strengths and values, the United States will continue to work with other countries to shape a recovery that promotes the health and prosperity of our people and planet at global and regional levels. In working to strengthen the WHO and other multilateral entities we are: - Accelerating global vaccine development and deployment, including by continuing to donate safe and effective vaccines - Collaborating with international organizations and industry to support geographically diversified manufacturing capacity, including through voluntary licensing - Improving information, data, and sample sharing, including sequencing new variants - Promoting transparent and responsible vaccine sharing practices - Bolstering vaccine confidence.

We reaffirm our support for all pillars of the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A), its COVAX facility, and affordable and equitable global access to vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Discover More U.S. COVID-19 Response: Strengthening Global Supply Chains President Biden is determined to help the global health system build back better. The United States is committed to working with partners in the private sector and with foreign governments to strengthen a diversified and resilient global supply chain, improve key global manufacturing capacities, and close global gaps in the availability and distribution of vaccines, therapeutics, testing, and PPE. Additionally, the United States with international partners are working together to make sure that the components that make these vital, life-saving drugs can move more smoothly around the world. Much of this work is guided by a series of Executive Orders and National Security Memorandum 1, released in the opening weeks of the Biden-Harris Administration, to provide U.S. leadership on global health and security. It has been further strengthened by the National Biodefense Strategy and the Bioeconomy Executive Order for a multifaceted approach to a complex challenge. Discover More Long-term Global Health Security Infrastructure Improvement and Reforms Advancing global health security and disease outbreak preparedness is vital not only to protect health and safety, but also to ensure economic prosperity and defend national security interests. As we have seen, if people become sick from an infectious disease, jobs can be lost and entire communities suffer. We are committed to strengthening global health security so that the world may build back better in order to prevent, detect, and respond to the next infectious disease outbreak. As a founding member of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) in 2014, the United States has invested in training and programs to strengthen countries' public health infrastructure. Our commitment to global health builds on a long tradition. Over the past two decades, the United States has provided more than $140 billion in global health assistance, including over $100 billion to fight HIV/AIDS through the [President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)](https://www.state.gov/pepfar/). Since 2003, PEPFAR has saved more than 25 million lives. We are the world's largest contributor to global health and the international response to COVID-19. Our assistance also addresses the humanitarian, economic, and social impacts of COVID-19. Longstanding health partnerships and investments\u2014including through the Global Health Security Agenda, President's Malaria Initiative, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi)\u2014have provided the technical expertise and critical infrastructure needed to bolster preparedness, rapidly respond to COVID-19, and save lives. We are also evaluating mechanisms that will leverage the current international political will to meaningfully and urgently improve global health security infrastructure to prevent, detect, and respond to future public health threats to include: - Strengthening the WHO; - Improving International Health Regulations implementation; and - Engaging with international partners and the private sector to distribute vaccines and determine appropriate approaches for safe travel and trade. - Advancing health security capacity building efforts, including through national, regional, and global efforts, as well as through U.S. bilateral partnerships to include but not limited to work through the Quad, APEC and launch of the Economic and Health Dialogue of the Americas.
