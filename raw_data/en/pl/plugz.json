Self-care means taking care of yourself so that you can be healthy, you can be well, you can do your job, you can help and care for others, and you can do all the things you need to and want to accomplish in a day. [Paula Gill Lopez, PhD](https://facultyprofile.fairfield.edu/?uname=pgilllopez), an associate professor in the department of psychological and educational consultation at Fairfield University in Fairfield, Connecticut, says the need for self-care is obvious. \"We have an epidemic of anxiety and depression,\" she says. \"Everybody feels it.\" Self-care is part of the answer to how we can all better cope with daily [stressors](/stress/guide/), explains [Kelsey Patel](https://www.kelseyjpatel.com/), a Los Angeles-based wellness expert. It's work stress. It's the stress of trying to keep up with the pace of daily life, which technology has hastened more than ever (just think how many emails come flooding into your inbox each day). \"People are feeling lonelier and less able to unwind and slow down, which makes them feel more anxious and overwhelmed by even the simplest tasks,\" Patel says. RELATED: [A Guide to Understanding Stress \u2014 Including How to Manage It](https://www.everydayhealth.com/stress/guide/) At Everyday Health, self-care is taking steps to tend to your physical and emotional health needs to the best of your ability. Here, we explore the trend, where the definition of self-care comes from, and what it can do for your long-term health. What Is Self-Care, and Why Is It Critical for Your Well-Being? According to this definition, self-care includes everything related to staying physically healthy \u2014 including hygiene, nutrition, and seeking medical care when needed. It's all the steps an individual can take to manage stressors in his or her life and take care of his or her own health and well-being. What Is Self-Care? Common Questions & Answers As self-care has become more mainstream, the definitions have started to become more about general wellbeing and tend to focus on tuning in to one's needs and meeting those needs. \"Self-care is anything that you do for yourself that feels nourishing,\" says [Marni Amsellem, PhD](https://www.smarthealthpsych.com/), a licensed psychologist based in the greater New York metropolitan area. \"That can be something that's relaxing or calming, or it can be something that is intellectual or spiritual or physical or practical or something you need to get done,\" she says. Self-care requires checking in with yourself and asking yourself how you're doing physically, mentally, and emotionally. Some people use it to deal with difficult news stories, while others practice self-care just to [maintain their happiness day to day](https://www.dailyom.com/journal/what-is-self-esteem). Self-care does not mean the same thing for everyone. Different people will adopt different self-care practices, and even your own definition might change over time. \"What is self-care for one person will likely differ from someone else, and what's self-care for you one day might not feel like self-care another day,\" Dr. Amsellem says. Engaging in self-care regularly could help you put your best foot forward. \"When we are regularly taking care of ourselves, we are better able to react to the things that go on in our lives,\" Amsellem says. \"It's something we do to maintain positive well-being.\" RELATED: [9 Essential Skills That Will Make You More Resilient](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/resilience/essential-skills-that-make-you-resilient/) Types of Self-Care \"It could be anything that floats your boat \u2014 anything that puts a smile on your face,\" Dr. Gill Lopez says. \"Anything that makes you feel cared for, even if it's you caring for yourself.\" There are a few different categories of self-care: - Emotional self-care, such as [self-talk](https://www.dailyom.com/journal/speaking-with-purpose/), weekly bubble baths, saying \"no\" to things that cause unnecessary stress, giving yourself permission to take a pause, or setting up a weekly coffee date with a friend - Physical self-care, such as prioritizing sleep, adopting an [exercise routine](https://www.everydayhealth.com/fitness/guide/)you can stick with, or choosing healthy and nourishing foods over highly processed ones - Spiritual self-care, such as attending a religious service, spending time in nature, [meditating](https://www.everydayhealth.com/meditation/), incorporating regular acts of kindness into your day, or keeping a [gratitude journal](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/united-states-of-stress/kept-gratitude-journal-month-it-changed-my-life/) Additionally, Gill Lopez puts self-care into two further categories: temporary and enduring. What Counts as Self-Care, and What Doesn't There's no way to say exactly what counts as self-care because everyone's definition is their own and unique. The underlying rule is that it's something that brings you sustained joy in the long run, Courtney says. And though there are plenty of examples of self-care that seem to tread a fine line between a health-enhancing behavior and self-indulgence, self-care doesn't have to be about padding your calendar with luxurious experiences or activities that cost money (though it certainly can). RELATED: [Is Social Media Busting or Boosting Your Stress?](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/united-states-of-stress/social-media-busting-boosting-your-stress/) Consider a manicure or a massage or any other pampering activity. It might seem indulgent, but if the activity helps you [de-stress](/stress/guide/relief/) and carve out time for yourself, it counts as self-care, Amsellem says. If weekly manicures or monthly spa days are beyond your means, they will likely add stress to your life in the long run, so there are plenty of other self-care practices you can adopt. \"Self-care does not have to cost anything \u2014 it's just doing things you enjoy. And a lot of the things we enjoy or feel fulfilled from cost nothing,\" Amsellem says. \"Stepping outside and taking a deep breath, for example, might be the greatest act of self-care.\" Even if you can't spend lots of time and money, Gill Lopez says you can still practice self-care several times a week by turning things you do every day into self-care practices. Maybe you try being more mindful of your thoughts on your commute, or maybe you find ways to make daily tasks, like showering, more enjoyable. Pick a soap with a scent that you love, and focus on the physical sensations of the shower. Gill Lopez says: What does your shower smell like? What does it sound like? How does the warm water feel on your skin? \"For about 10 minutes in the shower, which I have to do anyway, instead of letting my monkey brain run wild, I'm right there,\" she says. Daily chores like making your bed in the morning are also examples of self-care \u2014 or can be. \"This is where that individuality comes into play, because for some people there is no way making a bed feels like self-care \u2014 it may just feel like a chore,\" Amsellem says. But if it helps you claim your day and gives you a sense of accomplishment early on, you'll have that with you even if the rest of the day gets derailed, Amsellem says. The simple act of making your bed in the morning likely isn't sufficient to account for all your self-care, she says. You may need to routinely devote time and energy to other self-care practices, she adds. \"But if there are some days when you feel out of control, on those days, starting the day off doing what you wanted to do for yourself might be one of the biggest forms of self-care you engage in that day.\" And sometimes when all of our other self-care plans get thrown out of whack (you worked through your yoga class, your friend canceled your coffee date \u2014 we've all been there), it's those small practices of self-care that provide just enough calm to help us get through the day and wake up in a better mood tomorrow. RELATED: [20 Tips to Help You Build Resilience and Better Cope](https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/resilience/top-tips-help-build-cultivate-resilience/) The Effects: How Self-Care Benefits Your Health and Well-Being Many common self-care practices have been linked to longevity and other positive health outcomes, says [Ellen K. Baker, PhD](https://www.ellenkbakerphd.com/about-me), a psychologist based in Washington, DC. There's a lot of research, for example, showing that things like exercise, yoga, and mindfulness are supportive of mental and physical health, she says. The following self-care practices have been well-researched and linked to a longer life: - Exercise People who exercised between two and eight hours per week throughout their lives reduced their risk of an early death by 29 to 36 percent. - Finding Purpose According to the researchers behind a 2019 study, having a strong life purpose was associated with decreased mortality rates. - Diet Eating a diet filled with more servings of fruits and vegetables per day was associated with a lower risk of mortality, especially from heart-related issues. - Sleep A study published in 2017 found too little sleep (less than seven hours per night) was linked with higher mortality rates, though too much sleep wasn't healthy either. - Getting Outside According to a 2019 study, spending time in green space is associated with a lower mortality rate. The clinical evidence documenting the long-term health benefits of specifically taking a self-care approach to health (over other approaches) is less robust, but it is building. How to Start a Self-Care Routine To get started with a self-care routine: - Determine which activities bring you joy, replenish your energy, and restore your balance. - Start small by choosing one behavior you'd like to incorporate into your routine in the next week. - Build up to practicing that behavior every day for one week. - Reflect on how you feel. - Add more practices when ready. - Get support through sharing practices from loved ones, a coach, a licensed professional (like a therapist or dietitian), or through your healthcare plan, community, or workplace. Practicing self-care doesn't need to be a heavy lift right out of the gate. Here are a few ideas to ease you into your self-care journey: - Journal. - Start each day by paying attention to your breath for five minutes and setting intentions for the day. - Eat breakfast. - Reflect on what you're grateful for each night. - Put your phone on airplane mode for a half hour before bed each night to release yourself from the flurry of notifications. - Call a friend just to say hello. - Take up a relaxing hobby. - Pick a bedtime, and stick to it. Note: If you read this and feel a sense of demoralization or sadness from the challenges of mounting or establishing a self-care practice, it's best to get help and support. There may be barriers to caring for yourself from past trauma, mental health issues, or family situations that may be making it more challenging to get started. Seek support from trusted counselors and behavioral health providers (like a therapist), a trusted primary care doctor, or a close friend. The bottom line: Self-care can have a positive effect on your health and outlook, but it requires a commitment or intention to invest in your well-being.
