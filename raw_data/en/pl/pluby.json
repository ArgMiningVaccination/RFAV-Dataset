Unlike mature 17 antibodies, corresponding VRC01 germline precursors poorly bind to Env. Immunogen design 18 has mostly relied on glycan removal from trimeric Env constructs and has had limited 19 success in eliciting mature VRC01 bnAbs. To better understand elicitation of such bnAbs, we 20 characterized the inferred germline precursor of VRC01 in compl ex with ies interacted with a wild -type 426c core lacking variable loops 1 -3 in the 24 presence or absence of a glycan at position Asn276, with the latter form binding with higher 25 affinity than the former. Interactions in the presence of an Asn276 oligosaccharide could be 26 enhanced upon carbohydrate shor tening, which should be considered for immunogen design. 27 28 Introduction 29 Despite the tremendous impact of HIV -1 on human health, no efficacious HIV-1 vaccine 30 currently exists. The HIV -1 envelope ( Env) glycoprotein is a class -I fusion protein responsible for host 31 attachment and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (Dalgleish et al. , 1984) . Following 32 33 pre-fusion trimer s anchored in the viral membrane (Haim et al. , 2013). As the sole target of 34 neutralizing antibodies , Env is the focus of intense interest for current vaccine design initiatives. 35 However, HIV-1 Env relies on multiple mechanisms of immune evasion - including dense 36 glycosylation, sequence variation, conformational masking , and 2003; Zhou et al. , 2017) . For these reasons , development of an Env -based vaccine 39 capable of eliciting b roadly neutralizing antibodies ( bnAbs 3 The VRC01 -class of bnAbs is of particular interest for HIV-1 vaccine devel opment due to the 41 exceptional potency and breadth of several of its well-characterized members (Huang et al. , 2016; 42 Zhou et al. , 2015) . These bnAbs derive from the VH1 -2 variable heavy chain gene (Scheid et al. , 43 2011; Wu et al. , 2011) , have been isolated from multiple HIV-1-infected patients (Zhou et al. , 2013) , 44 and putative non -mutated precursors have been identified in na\u00efve individuals al. , 45 2016) . VRC01 -class bnAbs are characterized by an unusually short five amino -acid light chain 46 complementary -determining region (CDR ) L3 loop (Zhou et al. , 2015) and a much higher -level of 47 somatic hyper -mutation s than antibodies targeting other pat hogens (Wu et al. , 2015) . They bind the 48 CD4-binding site ( CD4 BS) in a way reminiscent of the interactions formed with the viral receptor CD4 , 49 making extensive CDR H2-mediated contacts while also exhibit ing multiple amino acid alterations in 50 the CDR L1 loop relative to germline precursors (Wu et al. , 2015; Zhou et al. 2013) . Altho ugh 51 glycosylation sites (NLGS s) that surround the CD4 BS sterically limit recognition by bnAbs (Zhou et al. , 52 2017) , particularly those present at position Asn276 in Loop D and along the V5 loop , mature VRC01 53 bnAbs overcome this barrier and potently neutralize numerous HIV -1 viral clades(Zhou et al. , 2017) 54 (Huang , 2016; Stewart -Jones al. , 2016; Wu et al. , 2015) . In contrast, the inferred germline 55 precursors of VRC01 -class bnAbs lack detectable binding to trimeric Env construct s harboring 56 glycans at the se locations (Jardine et al. , 2013; McGuire et al. , Medina Env antigens do not bind germline precursors of VRC01 - 59 class bnAbs , a few recently designed constructs have been shown to bind and activate this specific 60 class of B cell receptors (BCRs) (Jardine et al. , 2013; McGuire et al. 2013; Medina -Ram\u00edrez et 61 al., 2017) . We previously engineered a trimeric HIV-1 Env protein able to bind most VRC01 -class 62 precursors (McGuire et al. , 2013) . This construct was a trimeric gp140 protein derived from the clade 63 C 426c virus and lacked variable loops 1, 2, and 3 along with the putative NLGS s at position s Asn276 64 (loop D) as well as Asn460 and Asn463 (V5 loop ) (McGuire et al. , 2016) . Other constructs have also 65 been engineered to engage the inferred precursors of VRC01 -class bnAbs , all of which harbored 66 4 mutations eliminating the NLGS s in loop D (at position Asn276 ) and in the V5 loop(Briney Jardine McGuire 2016, 2013; Medina -Ram\u00edrez al. , 2017; Tian al. , 2016) . 68 Additionally , a gp120 core derived from the 01dG5 clade virus , which naturally lacks a glycan at 69 position Asn276 , was also shown to engage the inferred germline precursor of the VRC01 antibody 70 (VRC01 GL)(Wu 72 Tian et al. , 2016) , they largely fail to elicit mature antibodies capable of bypassing the restrictions 73 imposed by the glycan at position Asn276(Zhou et al. , 2017) . However, a recent study demonstrated 74 the successful elicitation of CD4 BS-targeted antibodies , distinct from the VRC01 lineage , upon 75 immunization of rabbits with an engineered clade C Env trimer (Dubrovskaya et al. , 2017) . 76 To potential avenues of elicitation of VRC01 -class bnAbs , we structurally 77 n VRC01 GL and two clade C Env constructs using a 78 cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and X -ray crystallography . One constructs is a soluble 79 trimeric 426c SOSIP with three NLGS s removed at positions Asn276, Asn460, and Asn463 based on 80 our prior work (McGuire et al. , 2016, 2013) . The second construct is a monomeric 426c core 81 containing all wild-type NLGSs (including those at positions Asn276, Asn460, and Asn463), but lacks 82 variable loops 1, 2, and 3 . The 426c strain naturally lacks NLGS s surrounding the CD4 BS at positions 83 Asn234 and Asn362 (363), which are present in other clades. Our structural analysis revealed that the 84 absence of these glycans leads to a reduc tion of local oligosaccharide density in the vicinity of the 85 NLGS at position Asn276 . Integrating this (BLI) assays glyco proteomic s, we here that VRC01 GL could bind to a 426c core construct in the 87 presence of all naturally occurring NLGSs surrounding the CD4 BS, including at position Asn276 and its 88 associated glycan . We also show the affinity of VRC01 GL for the 426c core could be modulated by 89 alteri ng protein expression condition s to enrich for longer glycans , and also by shortening glycans via 90 endoglycosidase treatment . These results suggest that priming of VRC01 -class bnAbs is possible 91 using an HIV-1 gp120 derivative containing a glycan at position Asn276 . Consequently, future 92 5 epito pe-based vaccine design strategies utilizing a 426c core preserving all NLGSs may be a 93 promising route for guiding elicitation of VRC01 -class bnAbs. 94 95 RESULTS 96 CryoEM s tructure of VRC01 GL in complex with a modified 426c HIV-1 SOSIP glycoprotein 97 trimer 98 Based on the known enhanced ability of VRC01 GL (and related germline antibodies ) to bind 99 lacking s at positions Asn276 , and Asn463 (McGuire et al. , 100 2013) , and the lack of detectable binding to 426c DS -SOSIP (Fig. 1A) , we engineered 426c DS-SOSIP trimer recapitulating the aforementioned glycan depletion mutations for structural 102 analysis . This construct harbors the S278A , T462A and T465A mutations , abolish ing the 103 corresponding NLGS s and enabling binding to VRC01 GL (Fig. 1B, Fig. 1 -figure supplement 1). It 104 also contains the SOSIP (Sanders et al. , 2002) and the 201C -433C (DS) mutations (Kwon et al. , 2015) 105 and is a chimera of 426c This glycan -depleted protein 106 construct is referred to as 426c DS-SOSIP D3 (Fig. 1 -figure supplement 1 ). The 107 VRC01 GL construct comprises the germline VH gene reverted sequences of VH1-2*02, which 108 includes CDR H1 and CDR H2 along with the mature CDR H3 of VRC01 and the germline VK3-11 with mature CDR L3 of VRC01 (Fig. 1 -figure supplement 2 ). Initial complex formation was evaluated 110 using negative -stain ing EM, which revealed sub-stoichiometric binding of VRC01 GL to supplement 3A). The VRC01 GL Fab appear ed to have a much lower affinity 112 for 426c DS-SOSIP D3, compared to the VRC01 GL IgG, the latter bound with an apparent equilibrium 113 dissociation constant of 43 nM (Fig. 1B ), neglecting the effect of avidity. We next attempted to 114 enhance binding of VRC01 GL Fab to 426c DS-SOSIP D3 by utilizing a mild glutaraldehyde cross - 115 linking strategy. As expected, we observed significantly increased saturation of 426c DS-SOSIP initial engagement of VRC01 GL to the 117 CD4 BS was a su itable approach to enrich for and study VRC01 GL-bound complexes (Fig. 1 -figure 118 6 supplement 3A). We therefore engineered a d isulfide bond between (426c 1 -figure supplement 1 and Fig. 1 -figure supplement 2 ). This strategy was previously employed to enhance 121 binding of VRC01 MAT to SOSIP trimers without altering interface contacts (Stewart -Jones et al. , 2016) . 122 Using this method, we purified an enriched fraction of Fab-bound trimers and used this sample for 123 structural characterization (Fig. 1C , Fig. 1 -figure supplement 3A-D). This strategy led us to 124 determine two cryoEM reconstructions of the 426c DS -SOSIP D3-VRC01 Fig. 1 -figure supplement 4 A-D, Fig. 1 -figure supplement 5): one with 126 three bound Fabs at 3.8\u00c5 resolution (Fig. 1D, Table 1 , Fig. 1 -figure supplement 3E, Fig. 1 -figure 127 supplement 4A-B), and one with two bound Fabs at 4.8 \u00c5 resolution (Fig. 1E, Fig. 1 -figure 128 supplement 3H, Fig. 1 -figure supplement 4C-D). 129 Similar ly to what was reported for the B41 SOSIP conditions (Fig. 1 D,E,F ) whereas it is open 131 in the conditions we used for negative -stain ing sample preparation (Ozorowski et al. , 2017) (Fig. 1 - 132 figure supplement 3B). We that the closed 426c a formed gp12 0 bridging sheet , which is reminiscent of other 134 closed SOSIP trimer structures (Fig. 1 G) (Julien 2016) . VRC01 GL-class antibod ies have recently been shown to also 136 bind to core gp120 constructs in the presence of a bridging sheet (Scharf et al. , 2016) . Our data 137 reveals that VRC01 GL could also bind a prefusion closed conformation , which ha d previously only 138 been reported for its mature counterpart , VRC01 MAT(Stewart -Jones et al. , 2016) (Fig. 1 G). 139 140 Structural a nalysis of the region surrounding the CD4 BS in 426c DS-SOSIP D3 141 Removal of CD4 BS-surrounding carbohydrates has been shown to enhance binding of CD4 BS- 142 targeted germline VRC01 -class antibodies and to increase the antigenicity of this region (McGuire et 143 al., 2016, 2013; Stamatatos et al. , 2017; Zhou et al. , 2017) . Our structural analysis rev eals that t he 144 7 426c DS-SOSIP naturally lacks an NLGS at position Asn234 near the CD4 BS, which is otherwise 145 conserved in 80% of known circulating HIV -1 strains (Crooks et al. , 2015) . Instead , 426c features a 146 glycan at Asn230 that is remote from the VRC01 epitope than glycan Asn234 (Jardine, Sok, et 147 al., 2016) (Fig. 1F). The oligosaccharide at position Asn230 appears to be highly dynamic , since only 148 the two proximal N -acetyl -glucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties are resolved in the reconstruction (Fig. 1 - 149 figure supplement 6) and does not interact with VRC01 GL or other glycans in the complex . Previous 150 structural characterization of clade s A and G SOSIP trimer s established that glycans at position s 151 Asn276 and Asn234 are in close proximity to each other and likely restrain each others' 152 conformational freedom (Jardine, Sok , Zhou of glycan Asn234 in 426c gp120 reduces local carbohydrate crowding near the CD4 BS and 154 could increase accessibility of this neutral ization supersite (Stewart -Jones et al. , 2016) and lead to 155 altered local glycan processing (Behrens et al. , 2018; 156 DS-SOSIP also lacks an NLGS at position Asn362 (363), which is present in 42% of 157 strains deposited in the HIV database (Gaschen et al. , 2018) (Fig. 1F). This oligosaccharide is located 158 distally from the viral membrane side of the SOSIP trimer (Fig. 1 F) and is sandwiched between the 159 VRC01 MAT heavy chain and glycan Asn386 in the structure of VRC01 MAT bound to the JR-FL SOSIP 160 trimer (clade B )(Stewart -Jones Fabs, revealed that Fab-bound protomers feature slightly better - 162 resolved density for glycan Asn386 than the free protomer when visualized at the same contour level 163 (Fig. 1 H). These observations suggest that VRC01 GL may stabilize the Asn386 glycan either through 164 reduc tion of its conformational freedom and/or via direct interactions with the Fab framework region . 165 The absence of glycan Asn362 or other topologically equivalent oligosaccharides in the 426c gp120 166 sequence likely contributes to increas ed accessibility of the CD4 BS to VRC01 GL-class bnAbs due to 167 the close proximity of this glycan to the epitope (Stewart -Jones et al. , 2016) (Fig. 1 F). 168 Similar ly to what is observed in available VRC01 MAT/SOSIP complex structures (Stewart -Jones 169 et al. , 2016) , glycan Asn197 density is also strongest when bound to VRC01 GL, but appears weaker in 170 8 the unbound protomer (Fig. 1 H), again indicati ng either Fab-induced stabilization or restriction of 171 movement . The position of glycan Asn197 differ s substantially between available structures of 172 monomeric gp120 epitope -based constructs bound to VRC01 GL-class conformation of 173 the VRC01 GL-bound SOSIP trimer report ed here (Fig. 1 G) (Scharf et al. , 2016) . This variation in 174 Asn197 positioning is guided by the formation of the gp120 bridging sheet in monomeric gp120 , 175 which would otherwise only form following CD4 receptor binding in the context of trimeric Env (Fig. 176 1G) (Kwon et al. , 2012; Zhou et al. , 2010) . This conformational difference includes the 20/21 loop, 177 whose orientation in the 426c DS-SOSIP D3-VRC01 GL complex differs relative to crystal structures of 178 VRC01 GL-class antibodies in complex with monomeric gp120 (Fig. 1 G) (Scharf et al. , 2016) . Although 179 the 20/21 loop is close to the VRC01 paratope, VRC01 MAT was reported to have minimal preference 180 in the conformation of the bridging sheet or 20/21 region, as 87% of its contact surface area includes 181 the conformationally invariant outer domain of gp120 (Zhou et al. , 2010) . Whether or not the 182 conformati on of the 20/21 region directly impacts germline VRC01 -class antibody binding affinities 183 remains unclear . However, VRC01 GL in complex with gp120 constructs lacking this domain have been 184 determined (eOD-GT6 and eOD -GT8) , demonstrating that these germline mAbs do not strictly require 185 this region for CD4 BS recognition when glycans surrounding the CD4 BS are also removed (Jardine et 186 al., 2013) . 187 188 Wild -type V5 loop NLGSs of the 426c core did not hinder binding to VRC01 GL Fabs 189 One of the mechanisms by which HIV-1 Env has evolved to avoid detection by the progenitors 190 of VRC01 -class bnAbs is by selection of V5 loop al. , 2016; Li et al. , 2011; Zhou et 191 al., 2010) which sterically limit access to the CD4 BS. The observation that VRC01 GL may 192 accommodate carbohydrates surrounding our 426c DS-SOSIP D3-VRC01 GL cryoEM 193 structure prompted us to assess the effect on binding of the two V5 loop putative NLGS s that VRC01 GL binding 195 could be detected following removal of glycan Asn276, and was further enhanced following removal 196 9 of wild-type NLGS s at positions Asn460 and Asn463 (McGuire et al. , 2013) . We also demonstrated 197 that removing the V1/V2, and V3 loops in gp140 Env trimers further increased binding of multiple 198 VRC01 germline antibodies relative to trimers only containing glycan -depleting 199 mutations (McGuire et al. , 2014, 2016) . However , the effect s of V1/V2 and V3 loops deletion on 200 VRC01 GL bindin g to 426 core constructs in the presence of glycans remains unclear . Here we 201 reintroduced the two NLGS s at positions Asn460 and Asn463 (in the V5 loop ) and assessed their 202 individual and cumulative effect s on VRC01 GL engagement of the 426c core construct comprised of 203 gp120 residues 44 to 492 and lacking the V1/V2 and V3 variable loops (Kwon et al. , 2012) . Expanding 204 on our prior work (McGuire et al. , 2016) , the following four 426c core glycan -deleted combinations 205 were tested -figure supplement 1, Fig. 2A -D, Supplementary File 1). 207 Reintroduction of the NLGS at position Asn460 (S278A/T465A) in the 426c core had no 208 detectable impact on VRC01 GL binding affinity despite the predicted overlap of a putative 209 carbohydrate at position Asn460 with the bound Fab(Guo et al. , 2012) (Fig. 2A -B, 210 Supplementary File 1). Indeed, our previous wor k removing NLGSs at pos itions Asn460 and Asn463 211 via the N460D/N463D mut ations had only a relatively minor impact on VRC01 GL engagement to 212 trimeric 426c constructs compared to the large increase in binding observed following removal of the 213 native Asn276 NLGS (McGuire et al. , 2016, 2013) . To better understand the molecular rational e of 214 these observation s with the monomeric 426c core construct , we engineered a HEK293 GnTI-/- cells, which lack N-acetyl-glucosaminyltransferase I activity and 217 thus are unable to generate complex N-linked carbohydrates (Wright and Morrison, 1994) . We then 218 determined its crystal structure at 2.3 \u00c5 resol ution after endoglycosidase H (E ndoH) treatment to 219 facilitate crystal lization (Depetris et al. , 2012 ; Freeze and Kranz, 2010) (Fig. 2E, Table 2 ). Despite 220 harboring an NLGS, n o glycan density could be resolved at position Asn460 in either of the two 221 molecule s of the a symmetric unit . Instead , the Asn460 side chain is hydrogen bond ed to the 222 10 backbone amide and carbonyl groups of Ile02 (Fig. 2F). In 223 support of this observation , we detect ed only unglycosylated Asn460 peptide fragments when 224 analyzing tryptic digests of this sample with liquid chromatography coupled to electron transfer/high - 225 energy collision mass 2 supplement 1A,B). Furthermore, only low levels of glycosylation were detected at Asn460 by 227 qualitative LC-MS/MS analysis of unliganded 426c core (lacking the G459C mutation) (Fig. 2 -figure 228 supplement 1C). Additionally, we performed VRC01 GL-based immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments 229 utilizing a VRC01 GL affinity column and the same 426c core construct . Semi -quantitative LC -MS/MS 230 comparison of the 426 gp120 core s amples from fractions that did not bind to VRC01 GL (\"unbound\" 231 flow-through) , and those elution) , revealed no difference in glycan occupancy of the 232 Asn460 NLGS (Fig. 2H) . This indicated this sequon is rarely glycosylated in 426c core and explain s 233 its negligible impact on VRC01 GL binding . The predicted overlap of a glycan Asn460 with VRC01 GL 234 and the absence of a resolved proximal GlcNAc in the crystal structure of 426c core-VRC01 GL also 235 suggests a likely strict preference for the unglycosylated Asn460 glycoform of the 426c gp120 for 236 binding (Fig. 2F ). 237 We furthermore observed that reintroduction of the Asn463 NLGS (S278A/T462A or S278A ) 238 also did not result in a reduction in VRC01 GL binding relative to the 426c S278A/T462A/T465A core 239 (Fig. 2A,C,D , Supplementary File 1). This result was unexpected , as V5 glycosylation of Env trimer s 240 containing all variable loops have been reported to negatively affect VRC01 GL recognition of the 241 CD4 BS (Huang et al. , 2016; Li et al. , 2011; McGuire et al. , 2013; Zhou et al. , 2010) . We observed 242 electron density for the proximal GlcNAc linked to Asn463 in one of the two molecules of the 243 asymmetric unit of the 426c core-VRC01 GL crystal structure and cross -validated the presence of this 244 post-translational modification using LC-MS/MS (Fig. 2G). VRC01 GL-based IP experiments followed 245 by semi -quantitative LC-MS/MS validated the se structural observations by detecting Asn463 246 glycosylation which was undistinguishable between \"bound\" flow 247 fractions (Fig. 2I ). This supports our BLI data suggesting th e Asn463 glycan does not hinder 248 11 VRC01 GL binding in the context of the 426c core and that this site is glycosylated . 249 250 VRC01 GL Fab bound to glycan -containing 251 A hallmar k of VRC01 -class bnAb maturation is the shortening of the CDR L1 loop length 252 and/or the addition of glycine residues , both of which have been proposed to enable accommodation 253 of the Asn276 glycan near the CD4 et 254 Zhou et al. , 2010) . Although VRC01 MAT was shown to bind to the trimeric Env CD4 BS in the presence 255 of glycan Asn276 , its removal significantly increase d binding affinity and neutralization potency 256 (Jardine et al. , 2013; McGuire et SOSIP constructs by eit her N276D or 258 (S/T)278(A/R) mutations significantly enhance d the antigenicity of the VRC01 epitope (McGuire et al. , 259 2013) . However, when such glycan -depleted trimeric Env constructs were used as 260 immunogens , the antibod ies they elicit fail to overcome the glycan present at position Asn276 of wild- 261 type viruses (Briney et al. , abrogated VRC01 GL interactions , indicating this residue was critical for binding (McGuire 263 et al. , 2016) . These observations suggest that initial engagement of VRC01 -class bnAb precursors in 264 infected individuals occur s with an asparagine at position 276 and may also be possible, at low levels, 265 in the presence of a glycan at this NLGS (Scharf et al. , 2016) . 266 Considering the reduced glycan shielding of the 426c strain , the deletion of variable loops 1, 2, 267 and 3 in our 426c core constructs , and the minimal impact V5 loop NLGS s had on VRC01 GL binding , 268 we test ed whether the wild type 426c core construct could interact with VRC01 GL in the presence of 269 the Asn276 NLGS 1 -figure supplement 1). BLI analysis revealed VRC01 GL bound similarly to 270 both the HEK293F and HEK293 GnTi-/--expressed 426c core s with equilibrium dissociation constants 271 of 11 M and 15 M, respectively (Fig. 3 A,B). The crystal structure of the disulfide engineered 426c 272 core-VRC01 GL complex expressed in GnTi-/- cells further reveal s the presence of a resolved glycan 273 12 at position Asn276 in one of the two molecules of the asymmetric unit , indicating VRC01 GL bound to 274 both Asn276 glycosylated and unglycosylated species (Fig. 3 C-J). 275 Analysis of this structure highlights distinct sets of interactions observed between the light 276 chain s of VRC01 GL or VRC01 MAT and glycan Asn276 , which is rotated ~ 90 when comparing the two 277 structures (Fig. 3C-D). In line with our previous observation that Asn276 is important for VRC01 GL 278 recognition (McGuire et al. , 2016) , we observed that Asn276 is hydrog en bond ed to the VRC01 GL light 279 chain residue Tyr91 and 426c DS in crosslinked complex structure (Fig. 3C (Stewart - 281 Jones 2016) . The CDRL1 of VRC01 GL has been shown to adopt multiple conformations both 282 when unliganded and when bound to eOD -GT6, the latter lacked a glycan at position Asn276 (Jardine 283 et al. , bound to the 426c 284 core TM4 adopt s a similar orientation as the one observed for the CDRL1 loop of VRC01 GL bound to 285 eOD-GT6 (Scharf et al. , 2016) (Jardine et al. , 2013) (Supplementary File 2). Comparison s between 286 the structure s of our 426c core-VRC01 GL complex 288 indicate that the CDR L1 of VRC01 GL accommodate the Asn2 76 accharide unliganded VRC01 GL (chain B) (Supplementary File 2)(Jardine 290 et al. , 2013) , but differs from a complex with a gp120 core lacking this glycan (Fig. 3 F-H). This 291 observation supports that disulfide crosslinking of 426c core-VRC01 GL did not distort 292 VRC01 GL into a non -native conformation for the accommodation of glycan Asn276 in our structure 293 (Fig. 3 C). LC-MS/MS analysis of the sample used for crystallization revealed N-linked carbohydrates 294 at 2 -figure Asn276 peptides were also identified , 296 corroborating the presence of two populations of molecules in the crystal structure and the ability of 297 VRC01 GL to recognize both species (Fig. 4 A, Fig. 2 -figure supplement 1F). 298 Despite the EndoH treatment used to promote crystallization of 426c core-VRC01 GL, no 299 13 (GlcNAc) 1 th e Asn276 NLGS by LC -MS/MS (Fig. 3A). In contrast, w e 300 detected digested glycopeptides containing (GlcNAc) 1 moieties for other NLGS s, confirming the 301 efficiency of the Endo H treatment (Fig. 2 -figure supplement 1B). These observations validated the 302 Asn276 glycan density observed in the crystal structure and suggest ed that bound VRC01 GL 303 protect ed the glycan Asn276 from enzymatic digestion (Fig. 4 A,B), but not oligosaccharides , 304 such as glycan Asn463 (Fig. 2E, G and Fig. 2 -figure supplement 1B). We further corroborated this 305 hypothesis by analyzing EndoH -treated 426c core in the absence of co-expressed VRC01 and 306 confirmed the presence of at position Asn276 by LC-MS/MS (Fig. 3A,C ), 307 supporting that digestion of this glycan was possible if not sterically hindered by the binding of this 308 Fab(Yet et al. , 1988) . 309 To probe wheth er the disulfide cross -link promoted artificial accommodation of glycan Asn276, 310 we performed an additional analysi s with samples obtained from IP experiments using the 426c core 311 construct lacking the G459C mutation . 426 core samples from the \"unbound \" flow -through and 312 \"bound \" elution fractions had distinct migration profiles by SDS -PAGE (Fig. 3 I), with the bound 313 fraction exhibiting higher electrophoretic mobility than the unbound species . LC-MS/MS revealed the 314 bound fraction was enriched for unglycosylated Asn276 peptides , suggesting this subspecies was the 315 preferred VRC01 GL binder (Fig. 3 I). This result corroborates reports of VRC01 GL binding occurring 316 preferentially in the absence of a glycan at position 276 (Jardine et al. , 2013; McGuire et al. , 2013; 2017) . However, w e also 318 detect ed that the majority of the Asn276 peptide signal was of the (GlcNAc) 2-(Man) 5 glycoform in 319 bound fraction s (approximately twice as much as the unglycosylated Asn276 signal) (Fig. 3I ), 320 suggesting VRC01 GL could indeed bind in the presence of this glycan and in the absence of an 321 engineered cross -link. This experiment, along with our crosslinked 426c core-VRC01 GL crystal 322 structure and qualitative LC-MS/MS, confirm both the glycosylated (Fig. 3 C,F,G,H,I ) and 323 unglycosylated Asn276 glycoforms are present following expression and that VRC01 GL could 324 accommodate both. In summary, VRC01 GL bound a 426c core with wild-type NLGS s, was sterically 325 14 compatible with glycan s present at positions Asn276 and Asn463, and strictly interacted with a 326 subspecies of gp120 lacking a glycan at position Asn460 . 327 328 Modulation of glycan composition alter ed VRC01 GL antibody recognition of the 426c core 329 Irrespective of the chosen expression system (HEK293F or HEK293 GnTI-/-), our LC-MS/MS 330 analys es showed that 426c core constructs all contained detectable levels of both the unglycosylated 331 and the (GlcNAc) 2-(Man) 5 oligosaccharide variants at position Asn276 (Fig. 4 A-B, Fig. 3 I, Fig. 2 - 332 figure supplement 1D-G). Since (GlcNAc) 2-(Man) 5 is a short glycan produced in mammalian 333 cells(Hossler et al. , 2009 ), and was the major detectable glycosylated form in VRC01 GL-based IP 334 \"bound\" elution fractions, we interrogated whether different ial expressio n conditions known to enrich 335 for (GlcNAc) 2-(Man) 9 glycans could negatively impact the binding of VRC01 GL IgGs to 426c core . GL binding to HEK293 GnTI-/--produced 426c core constructs expressed in the 337 absence or presence of 100 \u00b5M kifunensine to yield a range of (GlcNAc) 2-(Man) 5 to (GlcNAc) 2-(Man) 9 338 h 9 glycans, respectively (Depetris et al. , 2012) . 339 The efficacy of this strategy was confirmed by two orthogonal methods: 1) SDS-PAGE , which 340 demonstrated the two expression conditions yielded samples with distinct migration profiles , and 2) 341 LC-MS/MS , which confirmed enrichment for (GlcNAc) 2-(Man) 9 glycans in the presence of kifunensine 342 (Fig. 5A, Fig. 5 -figure supplement 1 A-C). Importantly, b inding affinities for the 426c core were 343 improved by ~10 fold in the context of immobilized full-length VRC01 GL IgGs relative to immobilized 344 VRC01 Fabs. The 426c core expressed using HEK293 GnTI-/- in the absence of kifunensine bound 345 VRC01 GL IgG with a KD of 2 \u00b5M (Fig. 5 -figure supplement 1B, Supplementary File 3), whereas 346 binding was significantly reduced when the 426c core was expressed in the presence of kifunensine 347 (Fig. 5C, Supplementary File 3). The VRC01 GL IgG binding affinity to 426c core expressed in GnTI-/- 348 cells in the presence of kifunensine was enhanced following treatment with EndoH (KD=245 nM, Fig. 349 5D, Supplementary File 3), confirming recognition of gp120 by VRC01 GL IgGs can occur in the 350 presence of GlcNAc at position Asn276 . This VRC01 GL IgG GnTI-/--expressed 426c S27 8A nM), although the kinetics of 352 binding differed for the two samples (Fig. 5 E). 353 Previous studies demonstrated enhanced VRC01 MAT binding following glycan Asn276 removal 354 although VRC01 2017) , 2016; et . Similar ly to VRC01 MAT, VRC01 GL binding wa s previously detected in the 357 absence of the Asn276 glycan (McGuire et al. , 2016, 2013) . In this present study, VRC01 GL binding 358 was also observed under typical expression conditions with the native Asn276 NLGS retained , but 359 was dramatically reduced following expression in the presence of kifunensine (Supplementary File 360 3, Fig. 5A,B,C , Fig. 5 -figure supplement 1A,B,E,F ). This may indicate that kifunensine treatment 361 results in dramatically more efficient glycosylation of some NLGS s or that differences in glycan length 362 influence recognition of VRC01 GL-class antibodies to the CD4 BS, or both (Fig. 5 A). In line with these 363 hypotheses , the VRC01 GL-based IP and subsequent semi -quantitative LC-MS/MS of the 426c core 364 expressed in the absence of kifunensine revealed a consistent preference for short and/or 365 unglycosylated species bound to VRC01 GL (Fig. 3 I, Fig. 5 F,G,H,I ). These findings explain the 366 observed increase in electrophoretic mobility of 426c core species in VRC01 GL-based IP fractions that 367 bound this antibody compared to the unbound fraction (Fig. 3 I). 368 While many 426c core glycans are likely to be affected by either kifunensine or EndoH 369 treatment, the Asn276 oligosaccharide is expected to have a pronounced negative effect on VRC01 GL 370 binding due to its direct overlap with VRC01 GL epitop e(Stewart core-VRC01 GL crystal structure does not re solve order ed mannose rings at position 372 Asn276 , despite their high detected abundance by LC-MS/MS , and thus only the two proximal 373 GlcNAc moieties were modeled in our structure ). This indicates the Asn276 mannose 374 moieties are likely not directly involved in binding to VRC01 GL light chain, but rather act as a steric 375 barrier VRC01 GL must overcome to interact with the CD4 BS. Qualitative LC -MS/MS analyses of the 376 426c DS -SOSIP trimer , expressed in the absence of kifunensine, revealed longer glycans at the 377 16 Asn276 NLGS , which correlated with a poorer binding affinity , relative to the 426c core also 378 expressed in the absence of kif unensine (Fig. 1A, Fig. 5 -figure supplement 2 nteractions 379 with the Asn276 -linked mannose moieties might be restricted to VRC01 MAT, as these rings are well- 380 resolved in corresponding crystal structures. VRC01 GL-specificity and compatibility for proximal 381 GlcNAcs is made evident by the increased affinity of VRC01 GL for the 426c core following digestion 382 with EndoH (Fig. 5D). These results indicate binding of several germline antibodies to gp120 core 383 constructs could potentially be modulated by tailoring protein expression conditions , oligosaccharide 384 length, and/or by endoglycosidase treatment , as opposed to strict muta tions aimed at abolishing 385 NLGS s (Kong et al. , 2010) . 386 387 The amino acid sequence intact 426c core Asn276 NLGS modulated VRC01 GL antibody 388 recognition 389 Considering our prior work demonstrating that amino acid composition of the Asn276 NLGS 390 impact ed VRC01 GL recognition independently of glycan presence (McGuire et al. , 2016) , and our 391 observation that VRC01 GL could bind to 426c core in the presence of a native NLGS at position 392 Asn276 (with a preferential selection for the unglycosylated variant ), we decided to test whether 393 altering the i dentity of the Asn276 NLGS at the 278 position c ould impact VRC01 GL-class antibody 394 binding . sequenced HIV -1 clades harbor a residue at position 278 of 395 gp120, 426c gp120 contains a serine at this position . Since r ecent report s suggested NXT NLGS 396 sites are more efficiently glycosylated relative to NXS sites (Huang et al. , 2017) , we 426c S278T core mutant (Fig. 1 -figure supplement 1 and Fig. 1 -figure 399 supplement 2 ). BLI experiments demonstrated the S278T mutation reduced the equilibrium 400 dissociation constant by 10 -fold relative to the wild type NLGS , mainly by decreasing association 401 kinetics (Fig. 6 A-D, Fig. 5 -figure supplement mutation abrogate VRC01 GL- 402 class antibody binding , despite an expected improvement in Asn276 glycosylation efficiency (Huang 403 17 et al. semi -quantitative LC-MS/MS revealed (GlcNAc) oligosaccharides 404 were predominantly detected at position Asn276 in the S278T mutant , though some unglycosylated 405 peptide s were still present at low levels (Fig. 5A, Fig. 2 -figure supplement 1H,I). 406 To rule out any potential impact residue identity at position 278 might have on VRC01 GL-class 407 antibody binding affinities (irrespective of glycosylation status ), we mutated the Asn276 NLGS using S278A, and S278 R (Fig. 1 -figure supplement 1 ). Although the magnitude of 409 binding was improved relative to both 426c core constructs containing a glycan at position Asn276, 410 no appreciable difference in affinit ies was detected among any of these NLGS -depleted 426 core 411 mutants (Fig. 6 -figure supplement 1A-F). Since binding was reduced following introduction of the 412 S278T mutation, these results collectively suggest that a significant fraction of the interaction s 413 observed by BLI between t he 426c core intact Asn276 NXS NLGS unglycosylated Asn276 subspecies . This construct is expected to be less-frequently 415 glycosylated at position Asn276 relative to the S278T mutant (Huang . However , 416 VRC01 detected with the 426c S278T core (Fig. 6 A-D, Fig. 6 -figure 417 supplement 1A), and E ndoH treatment (which retains core GlcNAcs) of both the S278 and S278T 418 constructs significantly improved IgG binding relative to their untreated counterparts (Fig. 6 E-H, Fig. 419 6-figure supplement 1A). Although t hese findings support that binding is dampened by the As n276 420 mannose moieties in the absence interactions were still possible , as under scored by the presence of this carbohydrate in the crystal 422 structure (Fig. 3 C), the EndoH protection assay (Fig. 4 B,C), and VRC01 GL-based IP LC -MS/MS 423 analyses of non -crosslinked samples (Fig. 3 I). The ability of VRC01 GL-class antibodies to recognize a 424 CD4 BS containing an NLGS at position Asn276 and the linked oligosaccharide is unprecedented , and 425 highlights a potentially unique feature of the 426c core construct containing all native NLGSs for 426 engagement of VRC01 GL antibodies. 427 428 Discussion 429 18 Broad-spectrum and potent n eutralization of HIV -1 by naturally occurring VRC01 bnAbs 430 targeting the CD4 BS is possible in humans (Huang et al. , 2016) . However, mature VRC01 -class bnAbs 431 are produced only in a small fraction of infected individuals and only after up to a decade following the 432 initial infection (Wu et al. , 2015) . Due to the negligible binding of germline -class trimers , we sought out to understand putative 434 mechanisms of primary engagement of this class of germline antibodies by various HIV -1 435 immunoge ns. To this end , we first engineered a disulfide bond between the glycan depleted 426c DS - 436 SOSIP D3 and VRC01 GL to promote complex formation . This tethering approach was recently 437 described for VRC01 MAT and led to native structure s that do not suffer from any distortions (Stewart - 438 Jones et al. , 2016) . It is unlikely that the engineered disulfide would force the VRC01 GL and 426 439 gp120 to interact in a homogeneous way . An engineered disulfide would only prevent the dissociation 440 of the two proteins (similarly to what we previously described for mature VRC01 (Stewart -Jones et al, 441 Cell 2016)), but will not force them to interact uniformly (Stewart -Jones et al. , 2016) . Using this 442 crosslinking strategy , we the deglycosylated 426c DS-SOSIP 443 D3 trimer in the absence of a formed bridging sheet and that this binding stabilized surrounding 444 CD4 BS carbohydrates at position Asn197 and Asn386 . Considering there was a minor enrichment for 445 the unglycosylated Asn197 glycoform in \"bound\" of the 426c core, there could be an entropic cost associated with binding in the 447 presence of this particular oligosaccharide . Additionally, we found that 426c natural ly lacks glycan s at 448 positions Asn234 and Asn 362, which likely enhanced accessibility of the CD4 BS to bnAbs and could 449 affect processing of nearby carbohydrates (Behrens et al. , 2018) , including glycan Asn276. We 450 propose this is one of the reason s explaining the ability of 426c DS-SOSIP D3 and 426c core 451 constructs to bind 452 Immunogen design efforts focusing on VRC01 -class bnAbs have thus far largely relied on the 453 mutagenic removal of NLGSs during priming followed by their reinsertion during subsequent boost 454 (McGuire et al. , 2013; Medina -Ram\u00edrez 2017; Zhou et al. , 2017) . This strategy may not 455 19 recapitulate the conditions of bona fide infection s, as several CD4 BS NLGSs are conserved am ongst 456 -Jones 457 et al. , 2016). The comp lete absence of these NLGSs during the priming phase may also remove a 458 selection pressure guiding proper accommodation of these glycans during antibody maturation , and 459 could explain the limited success of elicitation of VRC01 -class bnAbs capable of neutralizing natively 460 wild -type viruses. As a result , alternative priming and boost strategies retain ing these 461 native NLGSs may need to be considered. 462 Specifically, HIV-1 gp120 core constructs have previously been shown to have differential 463 processing of NLGSs around the CD4 BS relative to their trimeric SOSIP counterparts (Bonomelli et al. , 464 2011) . observed that reintroduction of 426c gp120 V5 loop NLGSs did not negatively impact 465 VRC01 GL binding to the 426c core in contrast with what was detected for trimeric 426c gp140 466 (McGuire et al. , 2013) . We found that VRC01 GL Fabs and IgGs could bind to the 426c core 467 (containing a wild -type Asn276 NLGS ) but, as expected, not to a 426c DS-SOSIP construct 468 containing all wild type NLGS s (Huang et al. , 2016) . We put forward this interaction is likely permitted 469 in the 426 core in part due to the absence of variable loops 1, 2, and 3 and could potentially be further 470 augmented by the natural absence of glycans at position Asn234 and Asn362 . It is also possible that 471 stabilized trimeric pre -fusion closed SOSIP constructs impart additional negative steric effects not 472 present in the monomeric gp120 core epitopes. This is supported by our observation that there is a 473 reduced amount of trimming of the Asn276 glycan in the 426c DS -SOSIP trimer relative to the 426c 474 core monomer . This could arise from steric properties of the trimer which would be absent in soluble 475 monomeric constructs, thereby limiting unfettered access of the glycosylation machinery to this site 476 during expression . It also remains to be determined if the conformation of the gp120 bridging sheet 477 influences the recognition efficacy of this germline antibody. 478 We found that VRC01 GL binding to 426c core constructs preferentially occurred using 479 expression systems allowing for production of short glycans and provide d a structural framework for 480 accommodation of the Asn276 oligosaccharide by the VRC01 GL CDR L1. As is the case for VRC01 MAT 481 20 (Jardine et al. , 2013; McGuire al. , 482 2017) , we would like to emphasize that the unglycosylated Asn276 variant is the preferred VRC01 GL 483 binding partner and likely had a n important contribution the interaction s observed by B LI. However, 484 we detect ed glycosylation at position Asn276 , both structurally and by LC -MS/MS following VRC01 485 based IP experiments , in the VRC01 GL-bound fractions , in the presence and absence of cysteine 486 cross -linking, respectively. This indicated accommodation of this oligosaccharide could occur during 487 VRC01 GL binding in the absence of CDRL1 lo op shortening and/or glycine addition , arguing in favor 488 of its retention in epitope -based constructs derived from the 426c strain of HIV -1. 489 The structural and biophysical data reported here provide a foundation for understanding h ow 490 bnAbs targeting the HIV-1 CD4 BS may be elicited in humans in the presence of a native Asn276 491 NLGS . We demonstrate d structurally that VRC01 GL binding to a 426c core is possible and appears to 492 occur both in the absence and presence of a glycan at position Asn276 , supporting recently proposed 493 hypotheses (Jardine, Sok, et al. , 2016; Scharf et al. , NLGS at position 494 Asn276 of g120 core constructs lacking select ed variable loops and in absence of glycans Asn234, 495 Asn362(36 3), and Asn460 could prove a useful strategy to elicit VRC01 -class antibodies during the 496 priming phase of immunization . Additionally, the stark differences in binding observed between 497 VRC01 GL and 426c DS -SOSIP or 426c core construct s suggest s \"germline -targeting\" vaccine design 498 strategies starting with an epitope -based gp120 immunogen may be a promising alternative to current 499 priming strategies focusing on glycan-depleted HIV -1 SOSIP trimer s. Indeed, a remarkable success 500 using site-directed epitope -based immunogen s targeting other antigenic regions of HIV-1 Env has 501 been recently achieved (Xu et al. , 2018) . In the context of VRC01 GL-targe ted immunogens, t he use of 502 insect cell expression systems may further benefit recognition of the HIV -1 CD4 BS due to the 503 abundance of paucimannose sugars (Altmann et al. , 1999) . This approach has already been reported 504 to enhance the immunogenicity of the CD4 BS for other HIV-1 antibodies , but has yet to be shown for 505 antibodies of the VRC01 lineage (Kong et al. , 2010) . We highlight here the advantages of using an 506 HIV-1 426c core construct for enhancing VRC01 -class germline antibod y -depleted 426c trimeric Env SOSIP construct and propose that these observation s be 508 considered in future HIV -1 vaccine design efforts. 509 510 511 22 Materials and methods 512 Key resources table 513 514 Reagent Type (species) or Resource Design ation Source or Reference Identifiers Additional Information 1, Strain: 426c ) 426c_ This paper - 1, Strain: 426c ) 426c_G 459C_g This paper 26 Virus - 1, Strain: 426c ) 426c_S This paper - 1, Strain: 518 HEK293S GnTI-/- and HEK293F cell lines were used for protein expression.

Particles were extracted 606 with a binning factor of 2 after correcting for the effect of the CTF by flipping the phases of each 607 micrograph with EMAN 1.9 (Ludtke 426c DS -SOSIP D3-VRC01 GL stack was pre (Kimanius et al. , 2016; Scheres, 2012b; a) with an addi tional binning factor 609 of 2 applied, resulting in a final pixel size of 6.4 \u00c5. Resulting particles were sorted by reference -free 610 2D classification over 25 iterations. The best particles were chosen for 3D classification into 6 classes 611 using RELION/2.1 (Kimanius et al. , 2016) . IP D3- 612 VRC01 GL, with the best 3D classes refined further in RELION/2.1 (Kimanius et al. , 2016) using the 613 gold-standard approach. 614 615 31 CryoEM sample p reparation . We applied 2L of 0.7 mg/mL of DS-SOSIP D3-VRC01 GL in 10 mM 616 7.5, performed by using an FEI Vitrobot Mark IV, using a blot time of 6 s at a 618 temperature of 22 \u00b0C and 100% humidity. 619 620 CryoEM data c ollection . Data collection was performed automatically using Leginon (Suloway et al. , 621 2005) to control an FEI Titan Krios Electron Microscope equipped with a Gatan Quantum GIF energy 622 filter and a K2 Summit direct electron d etector (Li et al. , 2013) operating in electron -counting mode 623 spanning a random defocus range between 2.0 and 3.5 m . Approximately 2,000 micro graphs were 624 collected with a pixel size of 1.36 \u00c5 at a dose rate of 8 counts per pixel per second and 15 -s 625 acquisition time (0.2 frame per second), yielding a final measured dose of 80 e/\u00c52 per movie. 626 627 CryoEM data p rocessing. Alignment of movie frames was carried out using MotionCor2 (Zheng et 628 al., 2017) with a B -factor of -100 \u00c52 and ied dose 629 electrons/\u00c52/frame. Omission low -quality micrographs left a total of 1,724 micrographs for 630 downstream data processing. ~567 ,000 particles were picked in a reference -free manner using DoG 631 picker (Voss et al. , 2009) . Global defocus and astigmatism were estimated using GCTF (Zhang, 2016) 632 on the non -dose weighted aligned sums. Dose -weighted p articles were b inned to a final pixel size of 633 5.44 \u00c5 for an initial round of 2D classification using RELION/2.1 (Kimanius et al. , 2016) . 634 selected particles were re-centered, re-extracted , and unbinned to a final pixel size of 1.36 \u00c5 and 635 subjected to 3D classification with RELION/2.1 (Kimanius et al. , 2016) using the 3 0 \u00c5 low -pass filtered 636 initial model generated from the DS -SOSIP D3-VRC01 GL negative -stain dataset . Out of the eight 637 resulting classes, five classes contained well defined secondary structure elements and three bound 638 Fabs . These classes were low-pass filtered to 20 \u00c5 and the best -resolved class was used as an initial 639 model during 3D refinement using C3 symmetry . Refined angles for all particles were subsequently 640 imported in to FREALIGN (Grigorieff, 2016; Lyumkis, Brilot, et al. , 2013) and further refined with an 641 32 applied particle weighting scheme. An additional iteration of refinement was performed by adjus ting 642 only the X/Y shifts. This refinement scheme resulted in a final estimated resolution of 3.8 \u00c5 for the 643 three -Fab complex. The VRC01 GL constant domains of the Fab were masked out during the final 644 rounds of refinement and omitted from the final model due to the inherent flexibility of the elbow 645 region (Stanfield et al. , 2006) . This same strategy was used for 3D classes of DS -SOSIP D3- 646 VRC01 GL containing only two Fabs (C1 symmetry), leading to a final estimated resolution of 4.8 \u00c5. 647 Reported resolutions are based on the gold -standard FSC = 0.143 criterion . Local resolution 648 estimates were generated using the ResMap software (Kucukelbir et al. , 2014) . 649 650 Model building and refinement. We selected a clade A HIV -1 BG505 SOS IP.664 trimer (Stewart - 651 Jones et al. , 2016) and the 426c.TM1deltaV1 -V3gp120 in complex with germline NIH46 -46(Scharf et 652 al., 2016) as initial reference models for building 426c DS -SOSIP D3-VRC01 GL. This model was 653 Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, Emsley et et al. , 2017) . We then further refined the structure in Rosetta using density -guided 655 protocols (Wang et al. , 2016) for the 3.8 \u00c5 resolution C3 reconstruction. This process was repeated 656 iteratively until convergence and high agreement with the map was achieved. T he Fab constant 657 domains were masked out during refinemen and omitted from the final mo del. Following refinement of 658 protein coordinates, identified N-linked glycans were manually docked into their corresponding 659 density and refined using Rosetta (DiMaio et al. , 2011) . Multiple rounds of minimization were 660 performed on the complete glycoprotein model and manually inspected for errors. Throughout this 661 process, we applied strict non -crystallogr aphic symmetry constraints in Rosetta (DiMaio et al. symmetric 426c DS -SOSIP D3-VRC01 GL structure bound to only two Fab s was built by 663 removing one of the VRC01 GL-A60C Fabs bound to the aforementioned C3 model and was minimized 664 using Rosetta without applying symmetry. Glycans not resolved by density in the unbound protomer 665 were manually trimmed. Final model quality was analyzed using Molprobity (Chen et al. , 2010) and 666 EM ringer (Barad et al. , 2015) . All figures were generated with UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al. , 2004) . (Life Technologies), and immunoprecipitation using 670 magnetic separation was carried out according to the manufacturer's prot ocol. 5 mg of 426c core 671 produced using HEK293S Gn TI-/- cells were incubated with 100 g of VRC01 GL-beads for 15 minutes 672 (first bind), after which the beads were removed and unbound material (flow through) was inc ubated 673 with a second fresh 100 g aliquot of VRC01 GL-beads for an additional 15 minutes (second bind). 674 VRC01 GL-beads from first and second binding were washed 3x before acidic elution and pH 675 neutralization of affinity -purified samples . Unbound material was further depleted by incubation with a 676 third 100 g of VRC01 GL-beads, which were removed, before analysis. Samples of the original input 677 426c core, and VRC01 GL-bound and unbound fractions were resolved by SDS gel electrophoresis 678 under reducing conditions and the remainder subjected to LC -MS/MS analysis , as described a bove. . For analysis of N-linked glycosylation profiles , an estimated 250 pmol of each 681 HIV-1 426c -based construct analyzed in this paper was denatured, reduced, and alkylated by dilution 682 to 5 M in 50 L of buffer containing 100 mM Tris (pH 8.5), 10 mM Tris(2 -carboxyethyl phosphine 683 , and 2% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate. 684 Samples were first heated to 95 \u00b0C for 10 min and then incubated for an additional 30 min at room 685 temperature in the dark. T he samples were digest with trypsin (Sigma Aldrich) , by diluting 20 L of 686 sample to total volume of 100L 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.5). Protease was added to the 687 samples in a ratio of 1:75 by weight and left to i ncubate at 37 \u00b0C overnight. After digestion, 2L of 688 formic acid was added to the samples to precipitate the sodium deoxycholate from the solution. After 689 centrifugation at 17,000\u00d7g for 25 min, 85 L of the supernatant was collected and centrifuged again 690 at 17,000\u00d7g for 5 min to ensure removal of any residual precipitated deoxycholate . 80 L of this 691 supernatant was collected. For each sample , 8L was injected on a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion 692 Tribrid mass spectrometer. A 35 -cm analytical column and a 3 -cm trap column filled with ReproSil - 693 34 used. Nanospray LC -MS/MS was used to separate 694 peptides over a 90-min gradient from 5 to 30% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. A positive spray 695 voltage of 2,100 was used with an ion transfer tube temperature of 350 \u00b0C. An electron - 696 transfer/higher -energy collision dissociati on ion -fragmentation scheme (Frese et al. , 2013) was used 697 with calibrated charge -dependent entity -type definition (ETD) parameters and supplemental higher - 698 energy collision dissociation energy of 0.15. A resolution setting of 120,000 with an AGC target of 699 2\u00d7105 was used for MS1, and a resolution setting of 30,000 with an AGC target of 1\u00d7105 was used for 700 MS2. Data were searched with the Protein Metrics Byonic software (Bern et al. , 2012) , using a small 701 custom database of recombinant protein sequences including the proteases used to prepare the 702 glycopeptides. Reverse decoy sequences were also included in the search. Specificity of the search 703 was set to C -terminal cleavage at R/K (tryps in), allowing up to two missed cleavages, with EthcD 704 fragmentation (b/y - and c/z -type ions). We used a precursor mass and product mass tolerance of 12 705 ppm and 24 ppm, respectively. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was set as fixed modification, 706 carbamidomethylation of the lysines and N -terminal amines were set as variable modification s, 707 methionine oxidation as variable modification, pyroglutamate identification was set for both N -terminal 708 glutamines and glutamates as a variable modification, and a concatenated N-linked gly can database 709 (derived from the four software -included databases) was used to identify glycopeptides. All analyzed 710 glycopeptid e hits were manually inspected to ensure for quality and accuracy. Semi -quantitative LC - 711 MS/MS of VRC01 -based immunoprecipitation exp eriments were performed using Skyline (MacLean et 712 al., 2010) with peak integration and LC -MS/MS searches imported from Byonic. Missed cleavages 713 and post -translational modifications listed above for qualitative LC -MS/MS searches were included in 714 the quantification of glycopeptides. All MS1 peak areas used for integration were manually inspected 715 to ensure for quality and accuracy. Unbound fractions from two experimental replicates were pooled 716 and injected as two technical replicates, whereas each \"bo und\" fraction (first bind and second bind) 717 were performed as two experimental and two technical replicates each. 718 719 35 720 References 721 Adams, T.C. and Z wart, P.H. 2010.
