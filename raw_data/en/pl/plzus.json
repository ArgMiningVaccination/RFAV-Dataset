Indiana Wesleyan offers engaging worship in Chapel, meaningful connection in small groups, and supportive faculty who will take the time to talk to you and pray with you. We believe God loves every student and desires to speak into their lives, no matter where they are on their spiritual journey. You will have real opportunities to do more than just talk about your faith; you will be able to live it out in practical ways. Students have many opportunities to serve on campus, off-campus, and internationally. Our mission is to encourage students to be World Changers right now. Chapel IWU is a worshipping community and gathering in an intentional and rhythmic way provides a supportive framework that fosters spiritual formation all over campus and is identity-forming. We prioritize the SPIRITUAL FORMATION HOUR every Monday-Wednesday-Friday at 10:05 a.m. During this hour, three days a week, our community pauses to worship, learn from God's Word, connect with each other, engage in spiritual practices, and grow spiritually. - Mondays @ 10:05 a.m. are set aside for WORD with an emphasis on Scripture. - Wednesdays @ 10:05 a.m. are set aside for WISDOM with an emphasis on small groups. - Fridays @ 10:05 a.m. are set aside for WITNESS with an emphasis on testimony. Check out our [CHAPEL MAP](https://www.indwes.edu/covid-19/marion-campus/IWU_SF_maps_student.pdf) to see what we value and prioritize as a community. Dean of Spiritual Formation & Campus Pastor [Rev.
