These treatment plans focus on bringing together Native American culture and traditions with evidence-based practices in order to produce the best outcome for our patients. Substance abuse pulls our native brothers and sisters away from the Creator. When they are ready to free themselves from the mind changers that have enslaved, we are ready to help them reconnect with their spirituality. Our alcohol abuse and drug addiction treatment plans focus on healing the mind, body and spirit. We introduce them to a sober community with people from all tribes and welcome them to share their songs, language, and art. Reconnecting with the Creator Smudging, Sweat Lodge, & Talking Circles Start your day with a prayer to the Creator. Let the burning sage carry your prayers and bless you in your new beginning in recovery from alcoholism or drug abuse. Now is the time to cleanse your spirit. We have separate male and female sweat lodge sessions monthly. The sweat lodge ceremony is sacred to many tribes and is also a form of cleansing the spirit. Our talking circles are hosted weekly by either a certified Firestarter or an Elder. What is discussed at a talking circle remains in the sacred space so that our patients practice an honest program of recovery. Where Culture and Recovery Waits You We truly appreciate Roy Johnston for hosting weekly Talking Circle Ceremonies for our patients. These sacred spaces embody the wisdom of ancient traditions while responding to the contemporary needs of individuals struggling with addiction. By integrating these cultural practices with traditional substance abuse treatment modalities, we are able to provide a more complete treatment program. These circles, rooted in ancient traditions and beliefs, provide a safe and sacred space for individuals to share their thoughts, emotions, and experiences. Talking circles were designed to create equality among the participants and respectful communication. Learn more about the importance of Talking Circle Ceremonies at Sunrise. Wellbriety Teachings at Sunrise Native Recovery Certified Firestarter Group Facilitators Don Coyhis's Wellbriety Movement trains their brothers and sisters in recovery in the culture of many different tribes. They learn the sacredness of their songs and ceremonies to share with those new in recovery so that they may find spiritual healing in their journey in sobriety. Licensed therapists and trauma specialists also host group sessions Monday - Saturday that focus on our patient's mental health. Alcoholism and active addiction can create traumatic environments that haunt a person's recovery. One-on-one therapist sessions and group sessions create a safe place for emotional and mental healing. "}
