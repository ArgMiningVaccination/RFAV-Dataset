As medical professionals, our primary concern is to maintain our patient and staff health, all while providing fertility care to our patients. How can we accomplish our goals? Virtual appointments! Virtual appointments (aka telemedicine or telehealth) are a great asset for New Patient Consults, Follow Up Appointments, IVF Orientations and FET Orientations. These virtual appointments cover all the same information as a face-to-face appointment, and they eliminate the risk of COVID-10 transmission 100%. By completing these appointments now, we will be prepared to promptly put your fertility plan into action when it is safe to begin treatment! That is great news! How can a patient make a virtual appointment? Patients can call Michigan Reproductive Medicine and schedule an appointment as usual (248-593-6990) and request an appointment. The patient will be given an appointment time to talk to Dr. Mersol-Barg or one of our Nurse Practitioners using the Zoom App. After the appointment, the patient will \"virtually meet\" with the nursing and/or front office staff, as needed. We've completed several virtual appointments, and we've received only positive feedback from our patients! Unfortunately, there's no such thing as creating a virtual baby. Until Michigan's Governor lifts the current COVID-19 safety restrictions, we will be pausing routine fertility treatments (including IUI and IVF). Nurses are always available by phone, so please call if you have a situation that requires urgent attention. We look forward to resuming our in-person treatments as soon as the restrictions have been lifted. Until then, we ask that everyone does their part in \"flattening the curve\" to keep COVID-19 infections to a minimum. Stay healthy and know that there is true hope for you to have a baby or achieve your fertility dreams. "}
