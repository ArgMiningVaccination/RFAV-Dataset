Mantra chant is, essentially, is a positive self-hypnosis. Traditionally, it has been used for both prayers and affirmations. \"OM,\" is a traditional mantra that acknowledges all that is, without any form of judgment. Deepak Chopra's \"the forgotten miracle' states that the body has an infinite capacity for change and renewal and that we should not ignore this. Every cell is made up of two invisible ingredients: awareness and energy. By bringing awareness and charging the energy, we can lead the body to self-transformation by changing its energy patterns that are the root cause of aging, infirmity and disease.

Abstract: Stress-induced disorders such as anxiety causing bodily pain and other symptoms represent the leading causes of adult disability. Studies have shown that yoga, contemplative practices such as meditation, breathing techniques, certain sound therapy and mantra chant may be effective in the treatment of mood disorders and stress. In this study, feedback on how sound and mantra chant can help to reduce stress, pain levels and anxiety in adults will be collected. Participants will be measured using MYMOP, Perceived Stress Scale, and higher levels of General Well-Being Scale questionnaire. These results will help to measure how sound therapy and chakra mantra chant may be a natural treatment for stress reduction and other pain symptoms. Thank you much and I hope to hear from you soon!
