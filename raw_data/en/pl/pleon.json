This is due to loss of the normal immune response in the pathogenesis of the disease itself but is also associated with drug-related factors, such as glucocorticoid and other immunosuppressants, during treatment. In addition, comorbidities, such as Felty's syndrome and interstitial pneumonia, and disabilities caused by the diseases or operations are also identified as risk factors. As the causes of the diseases have recently started to be discovered, targeted therapies, such as biologic agents and small molecule inhibitors, have been developed and widely used which may increase the possibility of new opportunistic infections that are different from what are related to conventional immunosuppressants [ [5](#ref5), [6](#ref6)]. [7](#ref7), [8](#ref8)]. The most significant reason is potentially the lack of understanding of the necessity of vaccination among healthcare providers who treat the disease and the patients. Although they understand the necessity, there seems to be concern regarding the possibility that vaccination can worsen the AIIRDs' activity or that vaccination may not be effective for patients with AIIRD to acquire adequate immunity. Numerous clinical practice guidelines have been published around the world to promote the interest of doctors and patients and raise their awareness regarding the latest knowledge. Many efforts have been made to inform the global medical community regarding the latest information on the vaccination of patients with AIIRD and induce suitable changes in practice patterns. DEVELOPMENT OF CLINICAL GUIDELINE Determination of targeted patients and vaccines of practice guideline Formation of the practice guideline development committee and the working committee [9](#ref9)]. Selection of key questions for practice guideline [Table 1](#T1)). Searches and selection of existing practice guidelines [Figure 1](#F1), [Table 2](#T2)). Review of the procedure for guideline and up-to-datedness [Tables 3](#T3)and [4](#T4)). [Table 5](#T5)). Survey on consensus of recommendations in the practice guideline Final review, approval, and distribution of the practice guideline GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS | |[Vaccination is unlikely to cause or aggravate AIIRD and generally recommended in AIIRD patients (LOE: Low/SOR: Strong recommendation).] [10](#ref10)- [17](#ref17)]. The majority of studies, however, have reported that vaccines can be safely administered without worsening underlying diseases, and large-scale epidemiological studies also reported that the degree of abnormal responses observed in patients with AIIRD was not different from that observed in the general population [ [18](#ref18)- [20](#ref20)]. [21](#ref21)- [26](#ref26)]. be restrictively considered depending on the level of immunosuppression by performing a risk-benefit analysis for individual patients. The risk of infections that may be caused by administering live attenuated vaccines can change depending on the type of vaccines and the level of immunosuppression. Herpes zoster vaccines can be considered for those who used a steroid for a short period within 2 weeks, and were given with a dose of >20 mg of prednisolone per day, a dose of 0.4 mg/kg of methotrexate per week, and a dose of >3.0 [26](#ref26)]. Since immunogenicity is generally created within 3 weeks after administering live attenuated vaccines, it is recommended to administer vaccines 4 weeks prior to planned immunosuppression ( [Table 6](#T6)) [ [21](#ref21)]. The recommended timing, however, can differ depending on the type of immunosuppressants. When administering live vaccines prior to anti-TNF and rituximab therapies, it is recommended to separate them by a 4-week interval, but in the case of administering abatacept or tocilizumab, an interval of 23 weeks is recommended [ [27](#ref27)- [31](#ref31)]. Unlike them, inactivated vaccines can be relatively safely administered while administering conventional DMARDs or biologic agents [ [22](#ref22), [26](#ref26)]. However, since immune responses can be slightly different depending on the type of administered immunosuppressive medications, vaccinations should be carefully performed. Combination therapies with methotrexate or anti-TNF drugs were reported to reduce the immunogenicity of vaccines, while no issue associated with the immunogenicity of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines was reported in a group to which adalimumab was solely administered [ [32](#ref32)- [34](#ref34)]. While it was reported that humoral immune responses were reduced when abatacept was administered, no significant effect was observed in the group of tocilizumab [ [35](#ref35), [36](#ref36)]. Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody against the protein CD20, significantly reduces humoral immune responses due to loss of B cells, and for this reason, it is recommended to vaccinate patients at least 4 weeks prior to treatment [ [22](#ref22), [37](#ref37)]. As such, since immunosuppression can impede immune responses after vaccination, vaccination is recommended in general prior to treatment, but it is not recommended to delay treatment for AIIRD for completing vaccinations [ [21](#ref21)]. [25](#ref25)]. In addition, the timing of administering live attenuated vaccines after discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapies differs depending on the type of medications and thus should be determined in consideration of the pharmacodynamic characteristics of medications [ [26](#ref26)]. In general, when taking 1020 mg of prednisolone for over 2 weeks, it is recognized as a high-dose steroid, and it is recommended to separate discontinuation of the medication and vaccination by a 4-week interval [ [38](#ref38), [39](#ref39)]. When a large amount of medications were intravenously injected, it is recommended to suspend vaccination at least for 3 months [ [38](#ref38)]. When 0.4 mg/kg/week or 20 mg/week of methotrexate or more was administered, it is recommended to administer vaccines 13 months after discontinuation of the medication [ [25](#ref25), [40](#ref40)]. In the case of leflunomide, due to its long half-life period, it is recommended to separate discontinuation of the medication and vaccination by the interval of 36 months. However, it can remain in the body in an activated state for as long as 2 years; therefore, it is recommended to administer vaccines 2 years after discontinuation [ [25](#ref25), [38](#ref38), [40](#ref40)]. As etanercept, among anti-TNF drugs, has a relatively short half-life period compared to other medications, vaccination can be considered 1 month after administering the medication. Conversely, other medications including adalimumab, certolizumab, and infliximab should be discontinued for 3 months before administering vaccines [ [25](#ref25), [38](#ref38), [40](#ref40)]. In the case of biologic agents like abatacept, tocilizumab, and ustekinumab, it is recommended to administer vaccines 3 months (5 times their half-life period) after discontinuation. Regarding rituximab, however, it is recommended to separate discontinuation of the medication and vaccination by the interval of 612 months both for live attenuated vaccines and inactivated vaccines considering the recovery period of cells [ [22](#ref22), [25](#ref25), [26](#ref26), [28](#ref28)- [30](#ref30), [40](#ref40)]. [22](#ref22)]. The vaccines that are recommended for those contemplating travel to the aforementioned places include hepatitis A and B, influenza, meningococcus, pneumococcus, tetanus, typhoid, cholera, rabies, tick-borne encephalitis virus, yellow fever, and MMR vaccines. 1) Yellow fever vaccination [25](#ref25)]. In general, it is recommended for patients with AIIRD to avoid travel to areas where yellow fever is endemic; but, those who inevitably have to visit such areas should write a waiver that states the reason why they cannot be vaccinated [ [41](#ref41)]. [42](#ref42)- [48](#ref48)]. In some cases, yellow fever and oral typhoid vaccines should be administered if necessary. However, as live vaccines can spread viruses after administration, those who received such vaccines, in general, need to be careful when in contact with patients who are receiving immunosuppressive therapies, for 2 weeks following vaccination. If there is any family member who was vaccinated against rotavirus, patients with AIIRD should avoid contacting the vaccinated family member's feces for 4 weeks and should maintain hand hygiene. VACCINATION RECOMMENDATIONS BY VACCINE Influenza vaccine | | 1) Vaccination targets [49](#ref49)]. A retrospective study, targeting 46,030 patients with rheumatoid arthritis reported that their influenza infection rate was high (409.33 vs. 306.12 persons/100,000 patients-days) and that the rate of complications was 2.75 times higher [ [50](#ref50)]. No relationship was observed between the increasing rates and the medications used for the patients. In general, since patients with AIIRD are judged to be more likely to contract influenza and complications, it is recommended to administer influenza vaccines to all patients with AIIRD, and most guidelines also recommend influenza vaccines as the highest priority vaccine. 2) Effects and efficacy of vaccine [34](#ref34), [51](#ref51)- [61](#ref61)] are administered. It has often been reported that the immunogenicity of patients with lupus is slightly decreased, and many studies reported no significant differences in immunogenicity between patients with lupus and healthy individuals [ [57](#ref57), [62](#ref62)- with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, systemic sclerosis, and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome were also reported to show no differences in immunogenicity compared to healthy persons [ [19](#ref19), [71](#ref71)- [73](#ref73)]. Only few studies exist, regarding the effects of influenza vaccines on patients with AIIRD; however, a large-scale observational study that targeted patients with rheumatoid arthritis reported that the infection rate of the vaccinated group decreased by 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5%29%) [ [74](#ref74)]. Another study that targeted patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic erythematosus lupus also reported that the share of those who contracted pneumonia, acute bronchitis, and virus infection in the vaccinated group was significantly lower than that of the non-vaccinated group [ [74](#ref74), [75](#ref75)]. The immunogenicity of influenza vaccines can differ, depending on the use of immunosuppressants and the type of medications. However, it was reported that the immunogenicity of patients with AIIRD was generally similar to or slightly lower than that of healthy individuals. 3) Safety of vaccine 4) Vaccination methods Pneumococcal vaccine 1) Vaccination targets [76](#ref76)]. The mortality rate of patients with rheumatoid arthritis from pneumonia increased by 25 times and the hospitalization rate of patients with rheumatoid arthritis is 2 times higher than that of general persons [ [77](#ref77)]. Since the share of those who contract infections and complications caused by S. pneumoniae among patients with AIIRD increases, all patients with AIIRD are recommended to be vaccinated against S. pneumoniae. 2) Effects and efficacy of vaccine [78](#ref78)- [84](#ref84)]. As for the effects of medications administered to patients with AIIRD on the immunogenicity of vaccines, csDMARDs did not show any effect, while methotrexate, rituximab, and abatacept were reported to decrease immunogenicity. The immunogenicity of pneumoccal vaccines differed depending on the type of anti-TNF drugs in early studies. In a randomized controlled trial that studied the effect of a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23 (PPSV23) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the effect of pneumonia prevention was unclear. However, it was conducted on a small number of patients with a severe immunocompromised condition. Furthermore, some reports show reduced immunogenicity in some patient groups. Therefore, efforts to optimize the effects such as adjusting the timing of inoculation are necessary [ [85](#ref85)]. 3) Safety of vaccine [77](#ref77)]. It was reported that the aluminum salts used as a vaccine adjuvant may cause fever, pain at the injection site, and malaise and can cause autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA); however, no study has been reported on streptococcal vaccines [ [86](#ref86)]. Yet, it was reported that both strong local and excessive systemic inflammatory responses were observed in patients with Beh\u00e7et's disease after vaccination, thus making it necessary to carefully observe patients after vaccination [ [87](#ref87)]. Another study reported that abnormal responses to pneumococcal vaccines were observed in infants who were less than 1 year old and had Kawasaki disease [ [88](#ref88)]. 4) Vaccination methods [89](#ref89)]. A booster effect is caused when administering the PCV13 first, while a hypo-responsiveness is caused when administering the PPSV23 first; therefore, it is advisable to administer the PCV13 first [ [90](#ref90)]. Hepatitis B vaccine | | 1) Vaccination targets [91](#ref91)- [93](#ref93)]. A retrospective study that targeted 123 HBsAg-positive patients with rheumatoid arthritis reported that hepatitis B was reactivated in 30 patients (24.4%) during treatment [ [94](#ref94)]. Multiple guidelines related to the vaccination of patients with AIIRD also recommend to vaccinate patients with AIIRD with no hepatitis B antibody (all HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs-negative) and unvaccinated individuals. Hepatitis B vaccines are more actively recommended for high-risk groups. The guidelines published by the KSID and the Korean Association for the Study of the Liver, the American College of Rheumatology, and the Canadian Rheumatology Association define hepatitis B high-risk groups as: those who abuse injection drugs; those who have sexual relations with multiple partners; those who travel or stay for a long time in areas where hepatitis B is prevalent; those who are frequently administered with blood components; male homosexuals; those who contact patients with hepatitis B; health care providers and laboratory workers who can be exposed to the hepatitis B virus [ [95](#ref95), [96](#ref96)]; patients with AIIRD who are being administered with biologic agents such as TNF-blockers and rituximab; and immunocompromised patients who are receiving high-dose steroid therapies [ [21](#ref21)]. 2) Effects and efficacy of vaccine [97](#ref97)]. To monitor the generation of antibodies, the potency of anti-HBs antibodies should be measured 46 weeks after the last vaccination. In the case that antibodies are not generated against hepatitis B after vaccination, it is recommended to administer 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccines (0, 1, and 6 months). [98](#ref98)]. For those who are positive only for anti-HBc, the HBV DNA test should be performed to identify whether the state is false positive or latent infectious, and, if negative, vaccination can be considered [ [99](#ref99)]. 3) Safety of vaccine [97](#ref97), [100](#ref100)]. Moreover, there is no study reporting that hepatitis B vaccines worsen AIIRD. 4) Vaccination methods Hepatitis A vaccine | | 1) Vaccination targets [22](#ref22), [23](#ref23)]. However, it is generally recommended to administer hepatitis A vaccines to patients with AIIRD based on the same indication of healthy individuals. The KSID recommends administering hepatitis A vaccines to patients with chronic diseases; workers in childcare facilities; health care providers and laboratory workers in danger of being exposed to hepatitis A virus; restaurant workers; those who travel to or stay for a long time in areas where hepatitis A is prevalent; those who are frequently administered with blood components; male homosexuals; those who abuse narcotic injections; and those who contact patients with hepatitis A [ [96](#ref96)]. Considering the epidemiology of hepatitis A in Korea, it is recommended to administer vaccines to those aged <40 years without an antibody test, and to those aged 40 years only after conducting an antibody test and confirming that they are antibody-negative [ [101](#ref101)]. 2) Effects and efficacy of vaccine 3) Safety of vaccine [102](#ref102)]. 4) Vaccination methods Human papillomavirus vaccine | | 1) Vaccination targets [103](#ref103)]. The systemic lupus erythematosus itself was an independent risk factor of the observed abnormalities (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.86.9), and there was no significant correlation with the use of immunosuppressants. The overall prevalence of HPV in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus was higher (11.8% vs. 7.3%), and that of multiple infections of HPV in patients with lupus was also higher (4.7% vs. 1.1%) [ [104](#ref104)]. Whereas, the viru's removal rate in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus was lower than that of a general group [ [105](#ref105)]. HPV vaccines are recommended for young adults with AIIRD, particularly females aged between 13 and 16 years before having their first sexual contact, and no later than the age of 26 years [ [23](#ref23), [25](#ref25), [106](#ref106)]. In the United States, HPV vaccines are allowed to be administered by the age of 45 years, but for those aged >26 years, vaccination should be determined considering their sexual contact history and immunosuppressive state. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are taking immunosuppressants, including biologic agents, are recommended to receive HPV vaccines when they are adapted [ [95](#ref95)]. Young male patients with AIIRD are also recommended to receive HPV vaccines should they have no vaccination history. Since many clinical studies reported that patients with systemic lupus erythematosus contracted HPV, vaccination should be highly considered. 2) Effects and efficacy of vaccines [107](#ref107)]. These research results indicate that administrating immunosuppressants, such as steroids and mycophenolate mofetil, can lower the HPV's immunogenicity. 3) Vaccine safety [107](#ref107)]. The frequency and severity of abnormal responses were not different from healthy individuals, while there is no sufficient evidence that they worsen AIIRD. It was reported that blood clots were created after vaccination (relative risk, 0.2/100,000); however, most cases had a relevant risk factor [ [108](#ref108)]. Patients with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome need to be carefully observed after administering vaccines. 4) Vaccination methods Tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccine | | 1) Vaccination targets [23](#ref23)]. 2) Effects and efficacy of vaccine [109](#ref109)]. There are various ways in which a decrease in the immunogenicity of vaccines caused by the use of immunosuppressants is observed, depending on the type of administered immunosuppressants. A slight decrease was observed in the case of methotrexate compared to healthy persons; however, the immunogenicity of vaccines in those who received combination therapies with methotrexate and rituximab was similar to the immunogenicity in those who were only administered methotrexate [ [110](#ref110)]. Although there was no study on patients with rheumatoid arthritis, the immunogenicity of healthy individuals who were administered tetanus vaccines 2 weeks after administering abatacept was reduced [ [111](#ref111)]. Those who were administered tetanus vaccines 8 weeks after administering abatacept showed similar immunogenicity compared to those who were administered with tetanus vaccines 2 weeks after receiving abatacept; but, the level was lower than that of those who did not receive abatacept. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were administered methotrexate and tocilizumab showed no significant difference regarding the immunogenicity of tetanus vaccines compared to those who were only administered methotrexate [ [36](#ref36)]. Some studies reported that the effects of tetanus-diphtheria-pertussis vaccines decreased in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus who showed high disease activity, but others reported opposite results, thus requiring an additional study [ [84](#ref84), [112](#ref112)- [114](#ref114)]. 3) Safety of vaccine [84](#ref84)]. 4) Vaccination methods Herpes zoster vaccine | | 1) Vaccination targets [115](#ref115)]. The KSID fully recommends to administer herpes zoster vaccines to adults aged 60 years regardless of their history of herpes zoster. In addition, it is recommended to determine whether to administer herpes zoster vaccines to adults aged 5059 years based on the conditions of individuals. Most practice guidelines for patients with AIIRD published in other countries recommend to administer herpes zoster vaccines to patients with AIIRD who are aged 60 years and are not severely immunocompromised [ [23](#ref23), [26](#ref26), [95](#ref95)]. Guidelines in Europe and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) of the United States state that herpes zoster vaccines can be administered even when using a low dose of efficacy of vaccines [116](#ref116), [117](#ref117)]. Another retrospective study reported that those who were administered the herpes zoster vaccines showed a lower prevalence than those who were not; however, they found that the effects disappeared 5 years after vaccination [ [118](#ref118)]. A prospective pilot study targeting 10 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus also reported that their immunogenicity was slightly reduced, but was not significant [ [119](#ref119)]. 3) Safety of vaccine 4) Vaccination methods [120](#ref120)]. Measles-mumps-rubella vaccine 1) Vaccination targets [23](#ref23)]. Epidemiological studies on MMR infections in patients with AIIRD are rare. Korea was certified by the World Health Organization as the country that eradicated measles in 2014. However, imported cases of measles have been intermittently reported. Since it is generally known that the risk of MMR infections and complications in patients with AIIRD is high, it is recommended to administer MMR vaccines to patients with AIIRD considering the state of immunity and the type of medications used when the risk of MMR infection is high and the risk of infections caused by live attenuated vaccines is low [ [23](#ref23), [121](#ref121)]. 2) Effects and efficacy of vaccine [122](#ref122), [123](#ref123)]. In conclusion, the immunogenicity of MMR vaccines can differ depending on the use of immunosuppressants and the type of medications; but, the level is generally assumed to be similar to or slightly lower than that of healthy individuals. 3) Safety of vaccine [124](#ref124)]. Unlike herpes zoster vaccines, the possibility of vaccination depending on the use and the dose of immunosuppressants are not mentioned in detail. 4) Vaccination methods DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS SUPPLEMENTARY "}
