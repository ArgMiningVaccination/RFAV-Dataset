Goiter is characterized by swelling of the thyroid gland. Though this condition may appear to be a frightening illness, you can easily treat it with the right combination of medical care and home remedies. In this article, we have listed the most effective home remedies for goiter. We have also discussed the causes of goiter, its symptoms, and who is most at risk of developing it. Scroll down to check them out! In This Article About The Thyroid Gland The thyroid gland is a small butterfly-shaped gland present in the lower front of the neck ( [1](https://www.womenshealth.gov/a-z-topics/thyroid-disease)). This gland is responsible for secreting thyroid hormones, which maintain our body's metabolism. Insufficiency or excess of thyroid hormones leads to malfunctioning of the thyroid gland. What Is Goiter? Goiter is a medical condition that is characterized by the enlargement or swelling of the thyroid gland ( [2](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/goitre/)). This may happen due to hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid glands), hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid glands), or euthyroidism (normal thyroid functioning). In simpler words, the lack of and also the excess of thyroid hormone can cause the gland to swell up. It is usually not a painful disease but brings along many other symptoms that can disrupt the normal functioning of your body . [Dr. Zeeshan Afzal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-zeeshan-afzal-47840b111/), MD, a specialty registrar at Addenbrookes Hospital, says, \"If goiter is left untreated, it can continue to grow and cause compression of nearby structures, such as the trachea or esophagus. This can lead to difficulty breathing or swallowing.\" Medical intervention is the most sought-after method for goiter treatment. Dr. Afzal says, \"The treatment for goiter depends on the underlying cause. In some cases, it may not require treatment if it is small and does not cause symptoms. If it is causing symptoms, treatment may involve medications, surgery, or radioactive iodine therapy.\" He adds, \"Medications may be used to treat an overactive thyroid or an underactive thyroid, which can cause goiter. Surgery may be necessary if the goiter is causing compression or breathing difficulties. Radioactive iodine therapy may be used to shrink the goiter by destroying the overactive thyroid cells.\" Hence, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate treatment for a goiter, as the fastest way to treat it may depend on the underlying cause. But, with the use of simple home remedies, you can alleviate the symptoms and assist the prescribed medicines to treat the problem faster. Let us look at the causes and symptoms of goiter first. We shall then delve into the home remedies for goiter. Iodine is one of the most important minerals to make thyroid hormones. The gland cannot make enough thyroid hormones if it does not get enough iodine from diet. Hence, iodine deficiency is the primary cause of developing goiter ( [3](https://www.thyroid.org/iodine-deficiency/)). Dr. Afzal says, \"Salt that is fortified with iodine can help to prevent goiter caused by iodine deficiency. However, if goiter is caused by another underlying condition, such as an autoimmune disorder, simply increasing iodine intake may not be effective in treating it.\" Some of the other causes of goiter are as follows: - Autoimmune diseasesi [X]A condition in which the body's immune system cannot differentiate between healthy cells and foreign cells and attacks its own cells. , such as Hashimoto's diseases and Graves' disease, wherein the body's immune system attacks the thyroid hormone production - Genetic defects - Injury or any infection to thyroid glands ( [3](https://www.thyroid.org/goiter/)) - Radiation therapy for cancer - Certain medications - Benigni [X]A term used to indicate an abnormal growth of cells or tumors that is non-cancerous and cannot invade nearby tissues. tumors or thyroid cancer ( [3](https://www.thyroid.org/goiter/)) Dr. Afzal notes, \"Not all goiters are cancerous, but some types can be a symptom of thyroid cancer. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause and rule out any potential malignancies.\" Who Are At Risk Of Goiter? - Women over the age of 40 - Family history of autoimmune disease - People with low iodine in diet ( [4](https://doi.org/10.1210/jcem.98.1.zeg27a)) Goiter Symptoms If you notice the following symptoms, it is quite possible that you have goiter: - Coughing for no reason - Having a constricted feeling in the throat - Hoarseness of voice - Discomfort or pain while swallowing - Mood swings - Difficulty in swallowing ( [2](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/goitre/)) - Visible swelling at the base of your neck - Unexplained weight loss or weight gain - Difficulty in breathing ( [2](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/goitre/)) - Puffy face ( [2](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/goitre/)) Please remember that many of these symptoms are also associated with other health conditions. Hence, do not assume you have goiter without getting a confirmed diagnosis from your doctor. If you are diagnosed with goiter, surgery or drugs are not the only solution. Fortunately, you can try several home remedies to reduce the size of the thyroid gland and get relief from the symptoms. These, as mentioned, work best if used in conjunction with the prescribed medicines. Home Remedies For Goiter 1.

However, we'd like to highlight a few remedies that are easy to make right from your kitchen pantry. And they are made with all natural ingredients like turmeric and coconut oil. Check out the infographic below to learn some incredibly easy to make home remedies that may help treat goiter. Some thing wrong with infographic shortcode. please verify shortcode syntax Goiter is a condition where the thyroid gland swells up due to either an excess or a lack of thyroid hormone production. While goiter by itself is not painful, it may lead to several health issues and should be addressed at the earliest. Difficulty swallowing, persistent coughing, mood swings, a constricted feeling in the throat, and sudden weight loss or weight gain are some of the common symptoms of goiter. Home remedies for goiter like seaweed, apple cider vinegar, castor oil, coconut oil, neck exercises, herbal poultices, and certain juices can help manage associated symptoms and issues and help in the recovery process when used along with prescribed medications. Frequently Asked Questions Tips For Treating Goiter Take a cold shower twice a day. This is supposed to stimulate the thyroid gland to function properly. Keep a tab on the medication you generally use as these can also trigger goiter. You can share the list (with the dosage) with your doctor to determine if any of these medications are the cause. Do the neck exercises regularly, but also keep in mind that these exercises should not be causing you any pain. Try to gently massage the swelling and the surrounding area using carrier oils like almond oil or olive oil. Give acupuncture or aromatherapy a try if you are more inclined to the alternative medicine and therapy for goiter treatment. What Is The Best Food For Goiter? There are certain foods that you can include in your diet to speed up recovery from goiter. These food items provide nutrition and replenish the iodine and selenium levels in the body causing a healthy amount of thyroid hormone to be produced. They also contain anti-inflammatory compounds and antioxidants which reduce the swelling and other symptoms. Here is the recommended diet for goiter. Iodine-Rich Diet - If your goiter is caused due to iodine deficiency, you need to replenish your body with an iodine-rich diet. Try using iodized salt or consume more seafood, cod fish, tuna, eggs, natural yogurt, milk, navy beans, baked potato with skin, and cranberries. Adults should consume about 150 micrograms of iodine every day to keep goiter away. Lettuce - Do not confuse this green leafy vegetable with cabbage, which is a cruciferous vegetable (and is not recommended for goiter patients). Lettuce is rich in iodine and is apt for consumption by goiter patients. Selenium Rich Foods - Your thyroid gland requires selenium to function at its optimal level. Some foods are naturally rich in this mineral like Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, shellfish, onions, mushrooms, wheatgerm, barley, meats, poultry, eggs, and fatty fish. Even meat items like kidney and liver can be consumed as they contain a good amount of selenium in them. Make these foods a part of your daily diet to help cure goiter. Bananas and pineapples are also recommended for goiter treatment. What Food To Avoid For Goiter? Goitrogenic foods are those that hinder normal functioning of the thyroid gland. As a result, the gland is unable to synthesize iodine properly. So, there are some foods that you should eat in moderation, and these include: Cauliflower Cabbage Turnip Brussels sprouts Mustard greens Spinach Broccoli Kale Soy beans Peanuts Radish Sweet potatoes Strawberries You can cook goitrogenic foods to negate their effect on your thyroid. While it is not necessary to eliminate them from your diet completely, you should consume them in moderation. Frequently Asked Questions What is the best vitamin for a goiter? Studies have found a link between vitamin A deficiency and a goiter ( [27](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51607230_The_role_of_vitamins_in_the_prevention_and_treatment_of_thyroid_disorders)). Apart from iodine-rich foods, you should consume vitamin A-rich foods like eggs, oily fish, and cheese to help keep your goiter under control. Is coffee good for a goiter? No, studies indicate that coffee may block the absorption of the thyroxine hormone ( [28](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18341376/)). Hence, consult your doctor to understand if you can consume coffee in case you have a goiter or other associated conditions. Can a goiter become cancerous? Yes, nodules in your goiter may hint towards cancerous growth. Consult a doctor and get the right tests done to understand your situation. What happens if a goiter is not treated? Untreated goiter can lead to hyperthyroidism (excess level of thyroid hormone) or Graves' ophthalmopathy (inflammation of the tissues and muscles around the eyes) ( [29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557859/)). Can a goiter burst? While it is very rare, a goiter can burst due to severe neck trauma. Do goiters keep growing? Yes, they can continue to grow, even in different directions, making it difficult to swallow or breathe. A person may also develop cellular growths, called thyroid nodules, in the goiter (which may be either cancerous or benign). Can a goiter shrink on its own? Yes, it is possible for a goiter to shrink and heal on its own. However, this depends on the severity of the condition. In most cases, it warrants proper treatment.
