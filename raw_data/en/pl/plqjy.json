Here are some drinks that may help you rectify the bowel movement: - Water Staying hydrated by drinking plenty of water can help you relieve constipation. Hydration makes digestion easy and supports muscle function. Having enough water can process nutrients faster thus aiding the bowel movement on a regular basis. When the body has sufficient water level it also ensures a better functioning colon as it absorbs less water. Constipation also occurs when the colon absorbs too much of water or if colon's muscles are too slow leading to hardening of the stool. So stay well hydrated. How much is enough: 8-9 cups of water is ideally good for healthy people. You can also consult your doctor for advice. - Lemon Juice Lemon juice is one of the most effective and easy-to-make home remedies to cure constipation. The citric acid, a natural laxative, present in lemon fights the toxins in your digestive track. Lemon juice acts as stimulant and flushes out the toxins from the body providing quick relief.

But incorporating some amount of caffeine in your body can stimulate the muscles in the digestive system as it contains small amounts of soluble fibers.

Also known as the 'warming herb', ginger increases the heat generation in body that can help speed up sluggish digestion. The hot water in tea further stimulates digestion and provides constipation relief. Ginger tea also has mild laxative effects that promote bowel activity. One of the most delicious and healthiest herbal teas, peppermint has two properties namely antispasmodic and carminative menthol that helps in relaxing the muscles of digestive tract and allows easy passage for food. The carminative property also relieves flatulence How much is enough: Have either of the tea twice in a day to ease the bowel activity. - Castor Oil Derived from castor plant, castor oil has several medicinal purposes that have been mentioned even in ancient Egyptian history. From curing stomach ache, curbing menstrual cramps to treating bruises, is also beneficial for constipation. Castor oil is known as a stimulant laxative, cleanses the intestine and facilitates motion. The strong aroma of the oil can make it hard for people to consume it directly. A teaspoon of the oil can be had with milk, juice or water. How much is enough: 1-2 teaspoons on an empty stomach is sufficient. Also Read: [Can't Afford A Personal Trainer?
