The warm weather will drive people outdoors to face one of the season's biggest problems, tree pollen, so children and adults with seasonal allergies should plan ahead. \"Many different types of seasonal nasal allergy treatments are available, including prescription medications and new combination therapies, mono- therapies, short - and long- term treatments that may help relieve symptoms,\" explains Dr. Pur vi Parikh, a board- certified adult and pediatric allergist and immunologist and Clinical Instructor of Medicine and Pediatrics at New York University School of Medicine. \"Because spring is the time when most people with allergies experience their worst seasonal allergy symptoms, it's important that allergy sufferers seek advice from a health care professional before the season hits full force.\" \"Many people suffer miserably in the spring with seasonal nasal allergies, which can impact one's ability to sleep and be productive in school or on the job,\" added Dr. Parikh. \"It's important to see a health care professional early, before the season hits full force, so you're armed with the tools and medicines that provide the most effective symptom relief for you and your family.\" About the Research The Spring Allergy Capitals ranking is an annual research and educational project of AAFA, designed to help patients recognize, prevent and safely treat allergy symptoms.
