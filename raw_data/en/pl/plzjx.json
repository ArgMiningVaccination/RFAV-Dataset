With our consciousness of human equality, we aim to create a women-empowered, human-centered environment. That is also due to our respect to Pachamama, the Mother Earth, who in Andean cosmology is the force loving & supporting all beings unconditionally, and our respect to our own mothers too. Every journey paid by our travelers, we pay it forward by donating 12% of what we earned to local community projects. You can decide which project you want to support: The dog shelter of Cusco, our reforestation project in Pucallpa or the children's home? We commit to the Andean principle of Sumac Kausay; the path of life, where everybody understands the deep meaning of living well and internalizes that the detriment of all beings is the deterioration of the whole. We want to make a change. By providing holistic tours that combine spiritual, physical, mental and emotional aspects we are helping people achieve spiritual enlightenment, heal trauma and find themselves to follow their personal purpose. To provide transformational travel experiences that empower people and inspire their life journey. Self transformation journeys as a pilgrimage for your body, mind & soul. See what 1000+ travellers have said about their 5 star experiences with Travel & Healing I contacted Healing & Travel to plan a 30 day Spiritual trip to Peru for me. They planned everything for me including Flights in Peru, Taxi, accommodations and all my activities. I participated in many activities including Spanish Lessons, 1 day tour of Cusco, Cooking Lessons, Chocolate Making Lessons, Horseback riding, 5 day Ayahuasca retreat, Cocoa ceremony, Rose ceremony, San Padro ceremony, Massage, Volunteering with the dog shlter, Volunteering with the elderly, 5 day Salkantay Trek and Trainig with a Maestro (Shaman). It was a well planned out trip. Any issues that I had they quickly helped me. I would definately recommend planning a trip with Healing & Travel, they can help organize anything you are looking to do. <3 Pamela Recommend this awakening journey for cultural & spiritual experience seekers! I heard about San Pedro from a blog article about Shamanic medicines and did research online before I signed up. When I met Angel's team, they did not push for sale, instead, they asked me to fill out a questionnaire about my health status for evaluation, and explained the ceremony process and the fact that San Pedro is natural mescaline (the effect would last for 5-8 hours after taking it) clearly in a very professional way. A perfect journey with mind-body-soul experiences in full aspect. SophieTsuei My daughter and I had the most wonderful experience with Travel and Healing. We wanted to have an authentic healing and cleansing ceremony with a shaman, but we didn't want an Ayahuasca-type adventure. We were so grateful for T&H's professionalism and punctuality. We were picked up at our hotel right on time, and our guide introduced us to our Shaman. We had 3 ceremonies, and the guide translated for the Shaman. It was profoundly moving to have the Shaman provide a coca-tea leaf reading, and to have a cleansing ceremony. The last ceremony was a traditional offering to Mother Earth. The entire morning was amazing, and a wonderful part of our trip to Peru. Highly recommend! Dolores H. "}
