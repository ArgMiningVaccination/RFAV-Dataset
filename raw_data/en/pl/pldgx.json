Have you ever met a person who had plastic surgery? If so, did he/she have only one plastic surgery? From my experience, many individuals who undergo plastic surgery for one body part, progress to enhance other body parts. Body augmentation seems addictive, and could potentially go on ad infinitum \u2014 that is, if the person has unlimited finances, and if doctors don't issue restrictions. Epitomizing this obsessive undertaking is the account of the individual known as the \" [Human Ken Doll](https://news.amomama.com/240951-rodrigo-alves-was-human-ken-doll-came-ou.html)\" (recently transitioned to a woman), who has willingly submitted to more than 100 cosmetic procedures. This phenomenon also reminds me of a Brady Bunch episode in which Carol Brady is inspired to paint one room of the house, and Mike Brady is highly reluctant, as he is concerned that once she paints one room of the house, she will feel the urge to paint another, and another . . . You get the point. Of course, in the fictional land of Brady Bunch, Mike Brady was both a professional architect, and a husband, and he aptly perceived where Carol could potentially get carried away with her house augmentation endeavor. A \"renovation\" theme is apropos given where my series is heading, as well as suited to the goals of the \"Reset,\" in which the central planners have delineated the retrofitting of humanity. In this particular instance, I am discussing augmentation of humans on the nano scale, in which the alterations may not be readily and immediately apparent. I plan to shed more light on this aspect, which may encompass a string of subtopics such as vaccines, gene therapies, gene editing (i.e., CRISPR), digital gene sequencing, Internet of nano-things, transgenic mice, chimeric organisms, bio-surveillance (i.e., embedded watermarks), and programmable matter. The technocratic engineers seem intoxicated with an insatiable desire to augment society, including our genomics. As of now, there are very little regulations in place by which to tame them. COVID may be the the most significant catalyst to their global venture, which may result in the evolution or devolution of humans \u2014 depending on the angle from which it is being viewed. Often when I research a topic \u2014 involving a broad subject such as synthetic biology \u2014 I don't necessarily lead with a hypothesis and aim to provide proof of said hypothesis. Rather, I tend to allow the research to unfold as the dots connect themselves. Of course, this can go on nearly indefinitely, and the rabbit holes can become deep and cavernous. Sure enough, this past month I fell down a particularly gnarly rabbit hole with endless twists and turns, and I found it challenging to come up for air. As I delved into people, places, and institutions involved in synthetic biology, it was uncanny how many of these entities had also popped up in my research on the COVID event, in which we are now all unwitting partakers. I hope to unpack these intriguing connections as I attempt \u2014 in various installments \u2014 to present a cohesive picture with the goal of tying it up in one overarching gestalt. While much of this information is accessible to the masses, the context is vast and convoluted. The nature-changers have not made this easy. Each installment will be brief and should stand on its own \u2014 like a book chapter \u2014 but not necessarily in a linear sequence. There will be minimal \"homework\" (non compulsory, of course) assigned to readers. Please keep in mind, if one subtopic is not of interest to you, another one may tickle your fancy. While most people may have little interest in the realm of synthetic biology, I consider it an obligatory avenue to navigate, as the technocratic architects of augmentation have lots of plans for humanity. Oddly, these same design-build engineers (many from the computer science realm), are the very individuals who are delineating the boundaries of ethics that would ordinarily contain them from running off the rails with their bold and possibly perilous plans. At this point, it's as if I have the beginning and end to this series mapped out, and the stuff between will simply have to reveal itself over time. Ultimately, I may be able (with outside help - hint, hint) to retroactively re-organize the material in a more coherent fashion. While my fort\u00e9 is investigative research, writing is a new undertaking for me \u2014 thanks to Mark T! I still plan to write various other pieces, so the assemblage of installments may not be consecutive. The first installment in this series will focus on the seemingly innocent country of Singapore as a technocratic role model for the new global order, and I will most likely circle back to Singapore at the end, featuring Biopolis, an international R&D center for biomedical science, and the related work of Dr. Sydney Brenner. Dr. Brenner reportedly lived, worked, and recently died (in April 2019) in Singapore, and was known as the founder of messenger RNA (mRNA). While it appears to be a most unlikely place in which to begin and end this story about synthetic biology (and its curious link to humanity and the ongoing COVID event, including next-generation sequencing and mRNA vaccines), I think it will become clear as the narrative unfolds. The title of this compilation, \"Of Monkeys, Mice and Men: From Natural Bodies to Digitized Bots,\" shall also make more sense as the puzzle pieces are laid out, and then interlocked. The task of writing this series \u2014 intended to examine the alchemical marriage of synthetic biology and COVID \u2014 feels extremely daunting and vulnerable for me, yet I feel compelled to trudge on. Thank you in advance for your patience and attention to this matter, which is not only timely, but potentially influencing us now and subsequently, in uncertain ways that only the self-proclaimed \"re-genitors\" of humanity have imagined. So, diving head first into synthetic matter \u2014 I will jumpstart my compilation with a statement from Kevin Corbett, PhD, R.N. in the article, \" [Ten Fatal Errors: Scientists Attack Paper That Established Global PCR Driven Lockdown,](https://uncoverdc.com/2020/12/03/ten-fatal-errors-scientists-attack-paper-that-established-global-pcr-driven-lockdown/)\" published by Celia Farber on December 3, 2020: \"Every scientific rationale for the development of that test has been totally destroyed by this paper. It's like Hiroshima/Nagasaki to the Covid test,\" he said. \"When Drosten developed the test, China hadn't given them a viral isolate. They developed the test from a sequence in a gene bank. Do you see? China gave them a genetic sequence with no corresponding viral isolate. They had a code, but no body for the code. No viral morphology.\" When asked by Celia Farber to define \"viral morphology\" for the layperson, Dr. Corbett replied: \"In the fish market,\" he said, \"it's like giving you a few bones and saying that's your fish. It could be any fish. Not even a skeleton. Here's a few fragments of bones. That's your fish. Listen, the Corman/Drosten paper, there's nothing from a patient in it. It's all from gene banks. and the bits of the virus sequence that weren't there they made up. They synthetically created them to fill in the blanks. That's what genetics is; it's a code. So its ABBBCCDDD and you're missing some what you think is EEE so you put it in. It's all synthetic. You just manufacture the bits that are missing. This is the end result of the geneticization of virology. This is basically a computer virus.\" In essence, what we may be witnessing and experiencing is the suspected instance of a virus being digitally imagined in the form of a genetic sequence. We can only surmise how this digitally-designed SARS-CoV-2 virus may have taken on life \u2014 whether it's been imaginary, virtual, or 3D-printed (either in its totality of nearly 30,000 base pairs, or more simply, in smaller fragments of the genome), which has multiple implications. Given that, at the time of this writing, nearly 50 Freedom of Information (FOI) requests reveal that [not one health/science institution around the world has been able to furnish a record of an unadulterated, purified isolate of SARS-CoV-2](https://www.fluoridefreepeel.ca/fois-reveal-that-health-science-institutions-around-the-world-have-no-record-of-sars-cov-2-isolation-purification), I lean now toward the notion of specific components of the purported virus having been 3D-printed, or printed utilizing another emerging bioprinting technology, such as [nanolithography](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/153046-mit-and-harvard-engineers-create-graphene-electronics-with-dna-based-lithography) or [laser printing](https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/153087-dna-laser-printing-heralds-new-day-for-genomics-research) [,](https://www.extremetech.com/computing/153046-mit-and-harvard-engineers-create-graphene-electronics-with-dna-based-lithography) subsequent to its computer-aided design, for use in the impending vaccines and therapeutics. Therefore, this digitization scenario suggests the prominent use of synthetic biology, and would explain the role of the same players in both the arenas of synthetic biology (including the field of digital biology) and this COVID enterprise. As I previously implied, while I did not begin my investigative exploration into this material with an established hypothesis, I have a pre-conclusion based on my research thus far, that one of the end goals of COVID is to launch the re-design of the human being (as hinted [here](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/opinions/covid-19-will-change-us-as-a-species-gleiser/index.html)). \" [Build Back Better](https://www.unisdr.org/files/53213_bbb.pdf)\" is the disaster-drunken elites' catch phrase of the day. Could building back \u2014 using a plethora of genetic modification projects \u2014 be a means to a dead end of humanity, and worse, to biological life itself? I hope you will stay tuned and vigilant.
