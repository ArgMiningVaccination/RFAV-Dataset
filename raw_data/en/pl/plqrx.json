We offer reliable live cell imaging solutions featuring silicone oil immersion objectives optimized to the refractive index of live cells. The imaging software that supports our inverted imaging platforms enables you to quickly and easily set up complex experiment protocols and configure precise functions such as incubation, maintaining the focus position using the motorized stage, and illumination control. Each inverted imaging platform meets the broad demands of live cell observation applications, from cellular level interactions to small structure in organelles, through the combined capabilities of TIRF, confocal, and super resolution imaging.
