The scammers are altering the information that appears on caller ID to show the State Board phone number and name (spoofing). The scammers are known to be aggressively accusing licensees of drug trafficking and/or money laundering and sending emails and text messages indicated the license has been suspended. In addition, the scammers are sending facsimiles to licensees on forged letterhead, originating from a fake phone number. BPOA reminds licensees and applicants of the following: \u00b7 We will NOT text, call or fax you a suspension notification. The Department initiates disciplinary action through an administrative process. If you are the subject of an investigation or disciplinary action, you will receive notice by certified mail and/or personal service. \u00b7 We will NOT engage you in a 3-way call with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). \u00b7 We will NOT ask you to receive faxes from a specific retailer for a fee. \u00b7 Do NOT give your personal or financial information over the phone, by text message or fax, including your zip code. \u00b7 We will NEVER request payment for any service or civil penalty by wire, gift cards or transfer to a foreign country. \u00b7 We WILL provide you with a contact name and phone number if you are the subject of an investigation or disciplinary action. \u00b7 CONTACT the Board office if you are not sure if a communication pertaining to your licensure status is legitimate. \u00b7 CONTACT your local police department or the Pennsylvania State Police if you believe you have been the victim of a scam. \u00b7 REPORT any email or online scam attempts to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) [Internet Crime Complaint Center(IC3) | Home Page](https://www.ic3.gov/) The State Board of Medicine regulates the practice of medicine through the licensure, registration and certification of members of the medical profession in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
