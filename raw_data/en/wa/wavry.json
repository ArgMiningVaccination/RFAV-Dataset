In fact, suicide is the third leading cause of death for 15- to 24-year-olds. Suicide does not just happen. Studies show that at least 90% of teens who kill themselves have some type of mental health problem, such asdepression, anxiety, drug or alcohol abuse, or a behavior problem. They may alsohave problems at school or with friends, or a combination of all these things.Usually they have had problems for some time. Most teens do not spend a long time planning to kill themselves. They may have thought about it or tried it in the past but only decide to do it soon aftera sudden intense event, such as getting in trouble, having an argument, breakingup with a partner, or receiving a bad grade on a test. Why do most teens kill themselves? Most teens who kill themselves have a mood disorder (bipolar disorder or depression). A mood disorder is an illness of the brain. A mood disorder can comeon suddenly or can be present on and off for most of a teen's life. A teen with a mood disorder may be in one mood for weeks or months or may fliprapidly from one feeling to another. Teens with bipolar disorder, also called manic depression, may change between mania (angry or very happy), depression (sad or crabby), and euthymia (normal mood). Some teens have more mania, some have more depression, andsome seem normal much of the time. Mania and depression can happen at thesame time. This is called a mixed state. Teens in a manic or a mixed state may \u0081 Strongly overreact when things do not go their way \u0081 Become hyper, agitated, or aggressive \u0081 Be overwhelmed with thoughts or feelings\u0081 Sleep less\u0081 Talk a lot more\u0081 Act in impulsive or dangerous ways\u0081 Feel they can do things they really can't Teens with depression may \u0081 Feel sad, down, or irritable, or not feel like doing things\u0081 Have a change in sleeping or eating habits\u0081 Feel guilty, worthless, or hopeless\u0081 Have less energy, or have more difficulty paying attention \u0081 Feel lonely, get easily upset, or talk about wanting to be dead \u0081 Lose interest in things they used to enjoy Mood disorders can be treated\u2014talk with your teen's doctor. Recent declines in teen suicide may be due to an increase in early detection, evaluation, andeffective treatment of mood disorders.What are the warning signs of depression or suicide? The following warning signs may be signs of a mental health problem,such as a mood disorder, or they may relate directly to suicidal thoughts or behavior: \u0081 Changes in functioning, such as \u2014 A drop in grades\u2014 Neglect of personal appearance\u2014 Neglect of responsibilities \u0081 Changes in emotions, such as \u2014 Appearing sad, hopeless, bored, or overwhelmed\u2014 Having spells of severe anger\u2014 Appearing more anxious or worried \u0081 Changes in behavior, such as \u2014 Getting in trouble, being rebellious, aggressive, or impulsive\u2014 Running away\u2014 Withdrawing from friends or family or having a big change in friends\u2014 Changing eating or sleeping habits\u2014 Losing interest in activities \u0081 Use of drugs or alcohol \u0081 Victim of sexual or physical abuse\u0081 Sexual feelings or confusion about sexual orientation that the teen finds unacceptable \u0081 Self-harmful behavior, such as cutting or anorexia\u0081 Talking or writing of suicide or death\u0081 Making a suicidal gesture, such as taking a small amount of pills Myths and facts \u0081Myth: Teens who kill themselves are obviously depressed. Fact: It's not always obvious. Parents are sometimes \"the last to know\" their teens are sodepressed and desperate. Teens are often very good at hiding their problems.While depressed adults may seem deeply sad and hopeless for quite a while,depressed teens may seem happy much of the time as they swing rapidly in and out of depression. \u0081 Myth: People who talk about suicide do not do it. Fact: Teens who talk about suicide or \"get away,\" \"disappear,\" \"end it,\" or\"die\" are much more likely to kill themselves than those who do not. Talk ofsuicide or death should be responded to right away. \u0081 Myth: Non-lethal suicide attempts may be dismissed as \"a cry for help\" or \"if he really wanted to kill himself, he would have done something more lethal.\" Fact: A non-lethal attempt, such as taking a small number of pills or making scratches on the wrist, may befollowed by more lethal behavior at a later time. In addition, the non-lethalattempt may indicate deep emotional problems not obvious otherwise.Suicide attempts or \"gestures\" should be taken very seriously with promptsafeguarding and intervention.Teen Suicide, Mood Disorder, and Depression \u0081Myth: \"She's just doing it to get attention.\" Fact: This is true at times, but the behavior can still be lethal. A teen not intending to die may still take toomany pills or miscalculate when someone will rescue her. What you can do \u0081Get help right away. Bring your teen to a hospital emergency department if you are worried he may hurt himself or others. \u0081Listen to your teen. This is harder than it sounds. Try not to offer suggestions on how to \"fix\" her problems. Ask your teen what is bothering herand whether she has been feeling sad or down. Ask whether she has everthought of suicide or not wanting to live anymore. Use words other thansuicide such as \"hurt yourself,\" \"end it all,\" \"get sleep and never wake up.\" \u0081Express understanding and support. While it's often easier to point out faults than to give praise, avoid being overly critical. Try to beunderstanding if your teen is \"in trouble\" or feels very negative about himself.Let him know that however he feels at the moment, you have an overallpositive view of who he is and his future. \u0081Talk with your teen's doctor about treatment, including an evaluation by a child and adolescent psychiatrist or other mental health professional. \u0081Remove firearms from the home. Studies show that even when firearms in the home are locked up, teens are more likely to kill themselves than those inhomes without firearms. Remember Family support and professional treatment can help teens who are at risk of suicide deal with their difficulties and feel better. Current treatments for mooddisorders and other mental health problems, such as individual and familycounseling, medications, and other therapies, along with long-term follow-up, canbe very helpful.The information contained in this publication should not be used as a substitute for the medical care and advice of your pediatrician.
