A healthy diet in combination with adequate sleep, exercise and frequent handwashing will give you the best shot at preventing illness and a faster recovery if you do get sick. Our immune systems are incredibly complex. The body is continually making the perfect balance of a variety of immune cells to help us combat the bacteria and viruses we are exposed to. The phrase, \"boosting our immune systems,\" may be an over-simplification as the different types and amounts of immune cells in our body vary when we are fighting an infection or illness. Instead, a healthy lifestyle and good nutrition helps our bodies and immune system function at its best. A word on supplement use for families People often visit the supplement aisle to \"boost\" their immunity by consuming high doses of specific nutrients. Supplements (vitamins, minerals or herbs) should be taken with caution as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require routine testing. Supplements can cause side effects on their own or interact with other prescribed medications. If purchasing supplements, make sure they have been third-party tested to ensure they actually contain the ingredients listed on the label and are not contaminated with harmful substances. Look for these designations from third-party labs on supplement labels to ensure their quality: Whole foods can help strengthen the immune system By choosing whole foods \u2014 such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and legumes \u2014 the body is supplied with essential nutrients. Whole, unprocessed foods (think chicken breast versus chicken nuggets) have not been modified and stripped of the essential nutrients, fiber, and phytochemicals (chemicals in plants that promote health). Additionally, many whole foods have a combination of nutrients that work together to promote health benefits which are not seen when consumed in isolation or as a supplement. Eating seasonally offers valuable nutrients Eating what's in season can help supply our bodies with some excellent immune-strengthening nutrients. This fall and winter check out your local farmers' market to stock up on some great food options that contain the following nutrients: - Vitamin A (or Beta Carotene) is an antioxidant to protect our cells from damage caused by free radicals. High levels can be found in sweet potatoes, butternut squash, carrots, broccoli and spinach. - Vitamin C is an antioxidant and the building block for collagen, which aids in wound healing. It is plentiful in citrus fruits and broccoli. - Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant and helps to reduce inflammation in our bodies. Nuts, seeds and avocados are good sources. - Zinc is essential to preserving our immune system, from maintaining our skin barrier to making enzymes. This nutrient is found in beans, seeds, nuts, seafood and poultry. - Omega-3 fatty acids help mitigate inflammation and are abundant in albacore tuna, salmon, chia seeds, flaxseeds, and sardines. Tips and recipes for immunity-strengthening foods When selecting your foods, focus on what to eat and not so much on what not to eat: - Eat whole, unprocessed foods the majority of the time - Eat a wide variety of plant-based foods (whole grains, proteins [beans, lentils, nuts], vegetables, fruits, fats [olive oil, avocado]) - Try to eat the rainbow (each color provides different phytochemicals with different health benefits) Immunity-strengthening recipes for families Enjoy these fun, kid-friendly recipes with your family.
