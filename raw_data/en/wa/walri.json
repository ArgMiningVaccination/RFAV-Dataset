Coronavirus Response: Reaction or New Reality? T he rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, in China and beyond prompted the World Health Organization to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on Jan. 30, 2020, and pushed regulatory organizations to evaluate needed response, researchers to accelerate studies of poten - tial treatments and vaccines, and pharma companies to examine supply chain and business disruptions. For an industry accustomed to long development and approval times, stringent regulatory oversight, and a not-so-transparent supply chain, the coming months may test bio/pharma's ability to react, adapt, and change. In a February 2020 report, FDA's Office of Pharmaceutical Quality (1), noted that, \"Quite simply, the quality of our drug supply is better than ever before.\" That same report, however, noted that nearly half of the physicians responding to a 2019 survey said drugs manufactured abroad were of lower quality than those manufactured in the United States. In light of the volume of APIs manufactured offshore, consumer confidence in drug quality may further erode with FDA's suspension of facility inspections in China, in accordance with a US State Department warning against travel in the region. The agency said its regular risk-based surveillance testing of imported products will continue, however. In lieu of inspections, the agency will use alternate mea - sures, include import screening, import alerts, a firm's previous compliance history, and information from foreign governments as part of mutual recognition agree - ments. The agency said it also will request records from firms \"in advance or in lieu of\" drug surveillance inspections in China to assess possible quality threats (2). A number of pharma companies and organizations are accelerating the investiga - tion of treatments and vaccines. For example, in late February, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases initiated the first US clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir (Gilead Sciences), on a volunteer patient diagnosed with COVID-19 who was quarantined on a cruise ship in Japan and repatriated to the United States. The investigational broad-spectrum antiviral treatment was previ - ously tested in humans with Ebola virus disease and has shown promise in animal models for treating other coronaviruses (3). FDA stated that the agency is providing regulatory advice, guidance, and tech - nical assistance to sponsors developing medical countermeasures to emerging threats. These efforts include the review of development proposals including the design and set-up of clinical trials. The agency also noted that under Emergency Use Authorization authority, the agency may allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency when clinical circumstances warrant (2). As US manufacturers rely on manufacturers in China for a significant portion of APIs and other raw materials, the potential for supply disruptions and drug shortages is likely. FDA noted that the agency is \"proactively reaching out to manufacturers as part of our vigilant and forward-leaning approach to identifying potential disrup - tions or shortages\" and is adding resources to monitor potential vulnerabilities. In the event of a potential shortage or disruption, FDA says it will work with manufac - turers to expedite review of alternate supplies to prevent shortages (2). Whether a disruption in the raw materials supply chain is incentive for US-based manufacturers to seek alternate suppliers in the West will be just one factor to watch. References 1.

The stated aims are to prevent or remedy drug shortages quickly, while also expanding patient access to less expensive medicines, primarily sterile injectables. The many challenges in producing drugs to meet quality standards, however, could undermine these undertakings. The issue has surfaced among Democratic presi- dential contenders as part of the debate over strate - gies for cutting drug prices. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) has proposed that Congress empower the federal government to manufacture drugs, an approach she said would lower the price of insu - lin and HIV treatments, as well as EpiPens and top-selling biotech therapies. And if Congress fails to act, Warren said she would do this administra - tively as a first initiative after becoming president. Local governments are eyeing similar activ - ities, as seen in the January announcement of California Governor Gavin Newson's plan for the state to establish its own generic drug label to gain access to cheaper medicines (1). The state's strategy is to use its buying power to contract with existing gener - ic-drug manufacturers for low prices on certain products, with a state pur - chasing list and prices to come. And the state could extend the program to brand products by allowing all drug purchasers in California\u2014public plans, private insurers, self-insured employ - ers\u2014to combine purchasing power to negotiate a lowest price for all. A move to ensure supplies and reduce costs of cutting-edge gene therapies is the goal of an initiative by a lead - ing research hospital to expand an existing small-scale operation that provides clinical sup - plies for early-stage gene therapy trials into broader production to handle anticipated growth in studies of gene-based treatments. The Columbus, Ohio-based Nationwide Children's Hospital's Abigail Wexner Research Institute (AWRI) aims to establish Andelyn Biosciences as a for-profit operation to support the production and advancement of novel gene therapies for rare diseases. Initially, Nationwide will extend current production from early research to sup - plies for more advanced clinical studies, and eventually gear up for commercial production of gene therapies (2). CIVICA TAKES LEAD California officials acknowledged in announc - ing their drug production plan that it was mod - eling its program on that established by the Civica Rx nonprofit formed in 2018 by a large group of hospitals and healthcare systems to create and produce more affordable generic drugs.

Led by Intermountain Healthcare, HCA Healthcare, Mayo Clinic, and several others, the group obtained funding from major philanthropies and engaged former Amgen Chief Quality Officer Martin VanTrieste as CEO. Civica began supplying drugs to its hospital members in 2019, based on an initial production contract with the Danish com - pany, Xellia, to provide certain anti-infectives. In July 2019, Civica signed a five-year agree - ment with Hikma Pharmaceuticals to manufacture and supply 14 sterile injectable medications to the organization, with Civica serving as a private label dis - tributor and using its own drug code. Then in January 2020, Civica announced an agreement with Thermo Fisher Scientific to develop its own medicines for member hospitals, starting with nine drugs used in critical or emergency care that have expe - rienced supply problems (4). By providing a guaranteed mar - ket for these contract manufac - turers, Civica aims to obtain the agreed-on medicines at lower, set prices. Ultimately Civica hopes to establish its own manufacturing facilities to produce more of its own generic drugs. Similarly, the hospital service firm Premier Inc.'s Provide Gx program negotiated a contract with Exela Pharma Sciences to produce certain sterile injectables experiencing long-term shortages for hundreds of hospitals in its network. The initiative started in October 2019 by resolving short - ages of several drugs, including cysteine hydrochloride injection for parenteral nutrition (5). Meanwhile, Civica took an important step to expand its cus -tomer base by forming a part - nership with the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBS) to cre - ate a subsidiary to manufacture generic drugs for health plans serving some 40 million patients. BCBS invested $55 million in the new venture, which aims to start with production by 2022 of 7-10 products lacking competition (6). Analysts expect that insulin will be a main target. In addition to addressing short - ages and affordability of vital medicines, VanTrieste empha - sized the larger goal of providing high-quality medicines that are always available at a public meet - ing on drug quality sponsored by FDA and the Duke Margolis Center for Health Policy in Washington, DC in February 2020. Convened to address stakeholder concerns about drug access and threats to quality from an expanding global supply chain, officials from the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research described efforts to encourage manufacturers to invest in advanced manufacturing and innovative technology to sup - port drug quality systems able to avoid shortages. In lamenting the uncertain quality of drugs made in China and India, VanTrieste said his program would disclose where the drug is made and the origin of active ingredients. Manufacturing costs may be higher for Civica products made in the United States, he acknowledged, but this non-profit organization will main - tain low prices. VanTrieste further supported FDA proposals for some kind of quality system score card, which would help companies that excel to expand, and those that fall short to see where to fix problems. Civica's strategy of working with established contract man - ufacturers appears appropriate, given the difficulties hospitals and health agencies often have with in-house production of drugs that meet FDA standards for qual-ity and safety. Several years ago, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) had to shut down a clin - ical supplies production unit at its main Clinical Center due to contamination and sterility issues identified in FDA inspections. A report on the program issued in 2016 documented the challenges in producing sterile injectables at even such a prominent health center and advised NIH not to rebuild the pharmaceutical pro - duction unit, but to tap commer - cial sources for sterile products (7). The report concluded by noting that manufacturing novel drugs for clinical trial use is \"a high-risk process\" that requires attention to quality, extensive staff training, and clearly defined standards.

This is the first antibody drug conjugate (ADC) treatment approved for metastatic urothelial cancer in the United States (2). The approval was based on the results of a 125-person, 7.6-month clinical trial that focused on patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer. The outcome showed a 44% response rate to the drug conjugate, with 12% having a complete response and 32% having a partial response. \"Antibody-drug conjugates [ADCs] are strategic tools in the targeted treatment of cancer. These conjugates combine the ability of monoclonal antibodies to target specific receptors on cancer cells and then deliver a drug to the cancer cell,\" said Richard Pazdur, MD, director of FDA's Oncology Center of Excellence and acting director of the Office of Oncologic Diseases in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in a press release. Padcev is an ADC that targets nectin-4, a cell surface protein expressed on bladder cancer cells, and carries monomethyl auristantin E, a cell-killing agent. Common side effects observed during the trial included fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, decreased appetite, rash, alopecia, nausea, altered taste, diarrhea, dry eye, pruritis, and dry skin. Medical oncologist and chief of the Genitourinary Medical Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Jonathan E. Rosenberg, praised the trial enrollment and welcomed the opportunity for patients with previously limited treatment options. \"Metastatic urothelial cancer is an aggressive and devastating disease with limited treatment options, and the approval of Padcev is a significant advance for these patients who previously had limited options after initial therapies failed,\" Rosenberg said in a press release. \"The Padcev clinical trial enrolled a range of patients whose cancer was difficult to treat, including those whose disease had spread to the liver.\" References 1.

Antibody-Drug Conjugate Shows Positive Activity Salivary The antibody-drug activity in HER2-amplified salivary gland tumors, according to data published in the Annals of Oncology regarding the Arm Q study, which is one of nearly 40 single-arm Phase II treatments in the NCI-Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (NCI-MATCH) trial (1). T-DM1 is a targeted therapy that comprises trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that attaches to the HER2 protein found on some cancer cells, and DM1, a cytotoxic drug that reduces the division of tumor cells. The ADC works to kill tumor cells while leaving healthy cells alone. The Arm Q trial consisted of 38 patients with pretreated multiple unique histologies who were given 3.6 mg/kg of T-DM1 every three weeks. Of the 38, 47% had their disease stabilized within 4.6 months, leaving the six-month progression-free survival rate at 23.6%. \"We saw that two of the three NCI-MATCH patients with salivary gland tumors had significant tumor shrinkage by at least 30% with T-DM1 treatment, and this benefit lasted,\" said lead researcher Komal Jhaveri, MD, a medical oncologist and early phase clinical trials specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, in a press release. \"The benefit lasted two years in the patient with squamous cell cancer of the parotid gland, and nine months in the case of mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid gland.\" As a part of the NCI-MATCH trial, each arm must evaluate the number of patients who had an objective response, and, if the rate is greater than 16%, the trial is given further study opportunities. While the conclusions from Arm Q did not meet the requirements, Keith T. Flaherty, MD, a medical oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston and study chair for the NCI-MATCH trial, feels the results from this trial were significant. \"We are excited about the prospect of this and other upcoming MATCH arms to shed new light on responsive tumor types, as there is far less data available in rare and uncommon disease types from previously conducted trials,\" Flaherty said. \"Salivary cancer is a particularly understudied area and seeing evidence of benefit for a molecularly targeted approach strongly supports further focus on this cancer type.\" Reference 1.

AGNES SHANLEY I n the earliest days of biotech, developers often struggled to sustain conditions that would optimize cell health and product yield. Today, better understanding of cells and how they interact with their environment has enabled improvements in most aspects of upstream processing, from bioreactor design and media development to process control, automation, and modeling. Some of the most significant gains have been made in cell line expression, advanced sensors, and automation, says Atul Mohindra, R&D director for biomanufacturing at Lonza Pharma and Biotech. \"Using automation, process analytical technologies (PAT), and advanced multivariate analysis has enabled the industry to control process performance and product quality more closely than ever before,\" he adds. Online sensing has become a focus for many developers, because it enables easier product release and tighter process control, says Avril Vermunt, strategic technologies partner- ships leader at GE Healthcare's life-sciences division. \"PAT has matured and is used more routinely now, through in-line pH, dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide sensors, while use of Raman spectroscopy is increasing,\" notes Darren Verlenden, head of bioprocessing at MilliporeSigma.In response to extreme cost pressures, companies are using or considering process intensification at every stage of upstream processing, says Andreas Castan, also strate- gic technology partnerships leader at GE Healthcare's life sciences group. \"We're seeing shrinking process footprints through continuous integration and connection of upstream and downstream processing,\" he says. The end result will be lower capital investment costs, more efficient and flexible operations, and higher yields in less time and space, says Verlenden. Currently, he says, 50-60% of biopharmaceutical developers and manufacturers have either implemented or are considering use of perfusion for seed train or production bioreactor steps. Used with high cell density cryopreservation, perfusion in N-1 and N-2 bio- reactors can reduce the cost of goods by 13.5%, shortening run times and increasing production bioreactor titers, he says. Improvements and standardization of media have also led to upstream improvements and higher yields. \"We've consistently been seeing titers in the range of 4-6 g/L in [monoclonal antibody] mAb fed-batch processing within a chemically defined media environment. This environ- ment, in turn, results in more consistent drug product with Cover Story: Upstream Processing www.biopharminternational.com M arch 2020 B ioPharm International 1 3an improved safety profile,\" says Verlenden. Single-use bioreactors at commercial scale (i.e., 2000 L) have become standard, he notes. Efforts have been underway for a few years to better integrate upstream and downstream operations to fur- ther reduce the overall cost of goods, says Alex Chatel, product manager at Univercells. Some observers credit this trend to increased use of the quality target product profile concept for inte- grated process design. Some of the lat- est biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility designs have cell culture and some purification unit operations take place in one location, notes Mohindra. At the same time, the indus- try is embracing digitalization, notes Vermunt. \"New ecosystems for data aggregation, data evaluation, and mod- eling have been created and leveraged and the bioreactor has been a focus for digital twin efforts,\" she says. Projects underway at various manufacturers and technology ven- dors suggest where upstream manu- facturing is heading. One showcase will be Amgen's facility in West Greenwich, RI, construction of which is expected to be completed in 2020 (1). Leveraging PAT and sensor tech- nology, it will feature a modular design and use portable 2000-L bioreactors and vessels and single-use bioreactors. At the contract development and manufacturing organization Lonza, at-line and on-line sensors have improved control of critical qual-ity attributes, says Mohindra. The company is using in-line sensors and Raman spectroscopy to enable precise measurement of viable cell concentra - tion and individual cell metabolites such as glucose and lactate, he explains. Using real-time data from these sen- sors has improved decision making, while automating data transcription between systems has minimized risk. Lonza is also moving to the use of electronic batch records to pull infor- mation from various systems and build a fully integrated, transparent manu- facturing network, says Mohindra. Other efforts focus on process intensification, he says, particularly at the inoculum stage. Over the past three years, Mohindra adds, Lonza has significantly improved host cell expres-sion levels along with its understanding of the design space and interactions between cells, media components, and raw materials. \"This understanding is what enables development of new engineering solutions improving speed, cost, and quality,\" he says. Bioreactor improvements have been key for most technology providers. GE Healthcare's life-sciences division, for instance, has updated its bioreactors to enhance process intensification, says Vermunt, and will soon introduce an automatic perfusion system that inte- grates into the company's Xcellerex bioreactor platform to facilitate inten- sification during both N-1 and N stages. The company is also working to improve sensors and use of near infra- red and Raman spectroscopy. Similarly, Pall Life Sciences has invested in bench-top automation that allows users more control over pro- cesses, says Odette Becheau, senior bioprocess application specialist. Pall's mPath platform features supervisory control and data acquisition capabil - ities that allow users to handle pro- cess control, monitoring, and data logging. Pall has also developed mod- eling and scalability tools for its iCel- lis and Allegro bioreactor lines and is integrating bioreactors with Aber Instruments' Futura biomass probe for continuous cell biomass measurement, says Becheau. Univercells has leveraged process intensification in a new single-use bio- reactor design that features a struc- tured fixed-bed bioreactor connected to an automated tangential flow fil-tration concentrator. The structured fixed-bed contributes to even cell dis- tributions throughout the bed matrix, which improves productivity and reproducibility relative to other com-mercial systems, says Chatel, while the concentrator reduces the number of downstream operations. SHORT-TERM GOALS Over the next five years, experts expect the process intensification trend to continue. Verlenden expects to see greater use of perfusion-developed cell lines, expansion and perfusion cell-culture media, cell retention applications, and associ- ated process automation and control. \"Process optimization will run towards maintaining cell densities of over 150 million cells/mL and cultivation run times of over 90 days,\" he says. These trends will also drive improvement of single-use technol- ogy to support new process templates, especially process intensification and perfusion, says Castan. \"Significantly higher cell densities will result in chal- lenges with respect to mixing and oxy- gen transfer, while new modalities such as cell and gene therapies will require innovation,\" he says. Movement to continuous biopro- cessing will have an impact on bio- reactor technology, says Becheau, especially as upstream production processes for viral vectors become mature. She expects to see continued migration from adherent producer cells to suspension cells, as well as the development of stable producer cell lines, which will result in increased productivity per cell, greater use of serum free or chemical defined media systems, and a better understanding and ability to measure media nutri- ent and feed requirements. \"For con- tinuous bioprocessing, development and implementation of more sophis- ticated cell retention strategies, such as the use of acoustic waves or fixed bed bioreactors, will greatly simplify operations and increase culture perfor- mance, mostly by reducing cell shear,\" she says. One fundamental near-term Cover Story: Upstream Processing 14 BioPharm International M arch 2020 w ww.biopharminternational.comchange will be an increasing number of new molecular formats in clinical programs (e.g., bispecifics). \"We will need to re-tune processes to improve the consistency and quality of products. This also means linking new in-line spectroscopic technology (e.g., Raman sensors) with data handling and ana- lytics,\" says Mohindra. He sees advances in process control and data analytics as one of the most exciting drivers of change in upstream bioprocessing. \"Where we used to be able to measure basic parameters such as dissolved oxygen, pH, and tempera- ture, we can now measure many more complex parameters in real time. The goal is to be able to measure conditions directly where the magic happens\u2014in the actual cell\u2014and this is really chal- lenging the industry,\" Mohindra says. CURRENT RESEARCH Research is underway around the world to help improve upstream pro- cessing and overall biopharmaceutical manufacturing. In the United States, a number of efforts are bridging the gap between basic and industrial research by having academic groups and research labs collaborate with com- panies to help address their top chal- lenges. One example is the Advanced Mammalian Biomanufacturing Innovation Center (AMBIC), a National Science Foundation (NSF)- funded cooperative with 25 corpo- rate members, which is focusing on upstream biomanufacturing and mam - malian cell culture and areas such as sensor development and media optimi- zation. The group has developed stan- dard reference Chinese hamster ovary cell lines for research projects to help establish a common baseline for under- standing cell responses and improve overall efforts. AMBIC has also developed graph - ical user interfaces to help member companies optimize media and cell longevity and performance by under- standing what is happening within the media and how conditions and changes affect cells. On the bioprocess engineering side, work at the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals (NIIMBL), funded by the Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technologies, aims to accelerate development and industrial adoption of manufacturing technologies, says Senior Fellow John Erickson. In February 2020, NIIMBL held a workshop on process intensification with technical leaders from 14 major biopharmaceutical manufacturers and suppliers. Under discussion is a case study that would establish a common language, standard requirements, and definitions for the control strategies that are needed for integrated, inten- sified bioprocesses, both on the drug substance and finished drug product side. Erickson sees this effort as being similar in spirit to work on the \"A-mAb\" case study for quality by design that was done over 10 years ago by the CMC Biotech Working Group (2). Further out in the future, there will be a need for new equipment and approaches to quality control and increased up- and downstream inte- gration. Today, notes Castan, most processes for the production of viral vectors are based on adherent cells, but new expression systems with suspen- sion cells are being developed. These systems will allow existing equipment to be leveraged for suspension cell pro- cesses, he explains, but that equipment will need to be smaller for cell and gene therapies than it is in traditional bio- pharm processes. Integrated systems will be needed to aseptically connect upstream and downstream so that the entire process operates as a closed sys- tem, he says. Typically, this has been done by adding aseptic connectors, he explains, but this approach only drives up tube set cost and increases the number of touchpoints for human interaction. \"Finding the right balance between functions, compliance, and affordability will likely include new designs and procedural controls,\" he says. Traditional quality control (QC) methods will also become outdated as the industry moves to continuous processing. \"We will need to replace current QC methods with in-line test- ing technologies, and they will need to be more accurate, fast, and robust than what exists today,\" says Mohindra. TRAINING NEEDS Change within the biopharmaceutical space has brought with it demands for new skillsets and training. Where, in the past, companies sought biochem- ists with basic cell culture and purifi- cation knowledge, they now require bioengineers with high through- put and automation expertise, says Mohindra. Most manufacturers and technology vendors are partnering with universities to design and deliver courses to help its workers develop the skills required. Currently, more career opportunities are opening up in gene therapy and viral vector manufacturing, but there's still a large skills gap, says Becheau. \"Companies are struggling to find tal- ent with the automation, computer sci-ence, and process modeling experience they need,\" she says. Another important change is that these more advanced skills are needed on the plant floor. \"Tasks that tradi- tionally would have been run by an analytical chemist or a data scientist may now be assigned to an operator, so the next-generation workforce will need to have a diverse background and be comfortable with evolving tools to manage new responsibilities right on the manufacturing floor,\" Vermunt says.

FELIZA MIRASOL T here are ongoing efforts to continually refine and enhance monoclonal antibody (mAb) production, driven in part by the pipeline of upcoming biologic drugs that features many new mAbs in development as well as biosimilar mAbs. To stay competitive, mAb manufacturing processes must maintain desired quality attributes while reducing time to market, being cost effective, and providing manufacturing flexibility. One con-cern in upstream processing lies in the raw materials used in cell culture. Not only is it critical to have validated sources of purity and quality, it is also important to have sustainable sources. THE MAMMALIAN LEGACY Today, commercial mAb production relies heavily on ani- mal-derived source material, particularly in the cell line source. Mammalian expression systems have been the workhorse of mAb bioprocessing, typically using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Other mammalian expression systems used include NS0 murine myeloma cells and PER. C6 human cells (1). Murine cells, however, produce some byproduct (i.e., alpha- Gal-alpha(1,3) Gal linkages) (1) that were found to instigate an antibody response in patients against the murine-cell derived therapeutic mAb. As a result, mAb production based on murine cells has been limited in the industry. Meanwhile, PER.C6 human cells are derived from trans- fected human embryonic retina cells. These cells are known to multiply indefinitely in suspension culture under serum-free conditions, making them a suitable and practical host for mAb production. The use of human host cells for mAb manufacture is being explored, with one advantage believed to be the compati-bility of using a human-cell-derived therapeutic to treat humans. Any residual host cell protein still present in the recombinant product, for example, would be of human origin, thereby lower-ing the risk that an unwanted or unpredicted immune response may be triggered in the patient against the therapeutic. Presently, CHO cells are the predominant cell source used in commercial mAb bioprocessing. CHO-derived cell lines have proven to be robust and high-yielding, or at least easily trans- fected to be high-yielding. However, production using CHO cells is still costly, and biomanufacturers are seeking ways to cut down on costs. In addition, there has been some evidence that residual CHO host cell proteins in the recombinant end product Upstream Processing www.biopharminternational.com M arch 2020 BioPharm International 17may have caused an undesired immune response in recipients (2). INSECTS INSTEAD OF MAMMALS? Alternatives to mammalian cell sources are being explored, including the use of insect cells. In one study (3), product yield, specificity, and glycosylation patterns were compared between insect-cell-based bioprocessing versus CHO-cell-based bioprocessing. The researchers achieved \"comparable\" amounts of secreted anti- bodies in the insect-cell-based systems as in the CHO-cell-based system. The anti- bodies expressed by all the insect cell lines used also successfully displayed highly specific antigen binding. The glycosyla- tion profiles of the antibodies produced in the insect-cell-based systems were also similar to the glycosylation patterns in CHO-cell-based expression. The use of insect sources for cell-line starting material can potentially lower production costs for mAbs. Specifically, insect cells used in conjunction with a baculovirus is promising. Such a system is known to be safe because baculovi- ruses have a very restricted host range (i.e., are highly preferential to a specific range of invertebrate host organisms) and are therefore not pathogenic to plants or ver-tebrate animals. The major advantage of a baculovirus/insect cell system, however, is the speed with which the system can produce stable, recombinant viruses capa- ble of yielding fully active protein product. An added bonus is that the protein pro- duced would have an easily modulated glycosylation profile. This would mean the product can be easily manipulated to closely resemble human proteins (4). The baculovirus/insect cell system is also a familiar one because it has already been in use to product recom- binant proteins for research, diagnostics, and for some therapeutics and vaccines. However, further study is required to determine how effective baculovirus/ insect-cell-derived antibodies would be in treating diseases, and whether their therapeutic effects would be comparable to the more commonly used CHO-cell- derived antibodies. ANIMAL-FREE ALTERNATIVES AND FUTURE PROSPECTS Although the use of animal-derived raw materials for mAb cell culture has been the dominant practice in the biopharma industry, there is interest and some move- ment away from the dependency on ani- mal-sourced material (5). There is already use in the industry of animal-compo- nent-free biochemicals and supplements for cell culture media. For example, fetal bovine serum (FBS), traditionally a preferred supple- ment mammalian cell culture, has largely been replaced by serum-free media and supplements, which tend to be more chemically defined, allowing for greater consistency from lot to lot. Another advantage is the traceability of serum- free, chemically defined media (versus media of animal origin), which supports compliance with global regulatory stan-dards. Serum-free media also provides high biological activity, stable supply, and predictable prices (6). Other attempts to shift away from animal-derived sources involve the use of plant-derived technology. For example, Agenus, a Lexington, MA-based immu- no-oncology company, is developing a plant-cell-culture based process to man- ufacture an adjuvant molecule for use in the production of vaccines (7). The com- pany's efforts are supported by a $1-mil - lion grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (8). Meanwhile, iBio, a plant-based bio- pharmaceutical contract development and manufacturing organization, has been applying its plant-based protein production technologies to advancing the development of rituximab biosimilar and biobetter products (9,10). The compa- ny's technology does not require a cell- line development phase as in traditional mammalian expression systems, which saves time and cost. Another player making inroads with a non-animal-derived cell culture tech-nology is biotechnology company Dyadic International, whose technology revolves around the use of a fungus-based source. The company has developed its C1 expression system based on the Myceliophthora thermophila fungus. The technology can produce proteins at a large scale. The C1 cell line doubles cells in about two hours, which pro - vides two to 10 times higher productiv- ity. Fermentation time is also reduced by one-third to one-half the time needed in a CHO-based system, with the added benefit of accruing only about one-tenth the media cost as CHO (2). Although the prospects for future alter- natives to mammalian, and specifically CHO-based, bioprocessing looks prom- ising, the adoption of such processes will not happen overnight. At present, there are many well-established mAbs in the market produced via traditional methods and dependent on mammalian-derived raw materials. However, the shift toward non-animal derived components in some aspects of the cell culture process demon- strate that the industry is actively looking to make a transition, particularly if yield, quality, and cost needs are met.

Upstream Processing 18 BioPharm International M arch 2020 w ww.biopharminternational.com your123/Stock.Adobe.com Building Data Quality In Generates Quality Data Out Ensuring the quality of data in process monitoring and control systems starts in process development phases. CYNTHIA A. CHALLENER A s biopharma manufacturers incorporate more data- driven monitoring and control systems in production processes, the quality of the data, as well as integrat- ing, interpreting, and protecting it, become more important. One solution is to build quality features into these systems during process development. As a process scales, \"there is a need to transfer or integrate process development (PD) data; therefore, building data quality into these activities right from the start is important. Management of data quality always facilitates integration with other systems irrespective of the scientific or business purpose,\" observes Chris Andrews, a senior solution consul- tant with Dassault Syst\u00e8mes BIOVIA. \"In the case of monitoring data during process development, it is critical,\" Andrews says, \"to identify and segregate valid data intended for technical transfer and to ensure that data are clean (i.e., have few invalid results or records) as possible. Higher quality data will minimize integration time, improve the ability to quickly interpret those data, and offer assurance of data integrity and provenance.\"Establishing a common format for data, units, and termi- nology will also simplify integration with other systems and prevent confusion during interpretation, adds Kevin Seaver, general manager for bioprocess automation and digital at GE Healthcare Life Sciences. In addition, working with secure databases and histori - ans, rather than in flat files such as comma-separated values (CSV) or extensible markup language (XML), allows easier data retrieval and integration along the way, according to Edita Botonjic-Sehic, global PAT manager at Pall Biotech. \"Feeding process data into a database immediately enables quicker validation and builds in an element of safety and secu- rity that does not come with flat file formats,\" she observes. Unfortunately, many analytical instruments default to pro - viding data in flat files, and the responsibility to build and connect to databases falls to the user. \"Wherever possible,\" Botonjic-Sehic says, \"this issue should be addressed from the CYNTHIA A. CHALLENER, PhD, is a contributing editor to BioPharm International . Downstream Processing www.biopharminternational.com M arch 2020 BioPharm International 19beginning to avoid creating more work or risking loss of critical data on the back end.\" DATA QUALITY APPROACHES There are many approaches to data qual- ity management, running the gamut from minimal to strict. The importance of the approach is relative to the crit- icality of the process being developed, according to Andrews. For example, he notes that \"monitoring data for low-risk, well-controlled unit operations or those with historic reliability would require less stringent control and quality manage- ment. For new or less well-controlled steps or techniques or otherwise high- risk operations, however, a more robust data quality regimen is called for.\" \"Quality oversight is required for lab- oratory/pilot-scale studies where process monitoring data will be used to develop the strategy for in-process control and/ or support key components of regulatory submissions,\" Seaver adds. \"The design space defined through these studies provides insight into the criticality and acceptable ranges for controlled parame- ters and performance or quality attributes. Therefore, interpretation of the results determines the materials, run conditions, and testing strategies for scaling-up and the final commercial process, to ensure the safety, efficacy, and potency of the final product,\" he continues. As a result, Andrews asserts that for scale-up and commercial processing, data quality is very important. \"While not required for licensing, the integration of upstream development data with engi- neering runs, scale-up, and production data has exceptional business value. There is a wealth of information to be drawn from all phases of the product develop- ment lifecycle,\" he says. It is essential, though, according to Botonjic-Sehic, to not only understand the instrument being used and the data it produces, but also the deeper con - text behind each data point pulled and stored (metadata). \"Beyond tracking a number, a user needs to be able to understand what part of the process gave that number and how it relates to the process performance. If there is inadequate metadata available from the PD scale, then the usefulness of that process data during scale up and commercial processing will be limited. Properly contextualized data is criti- cal for troubleshooting and success as the process is transferred from process development to commercial processing scale,\" she explains. LAYERS OF BEST PRACTICE Quality is achieved through a multi-lay- ered approach. Encompassing all activ- ities and at all stages of the therapeutic product lifecycle should be a culture of quality and commitment to the ulti- mate endpoint of that product\u2014the patient. \"Fostering such a culture of quality is the best way to ensure high-quality process monitoring and control during process development,\" Andrews says. The next layer involves the leveraging of standards to drive the way that data are stored, transferred and applied to ensure a coordinated approach. Botonjic-Sehic notes that within the pharmaceutical industry, additional guidance that governs data systems helps manufacturers meet regulatory requirements. Standards are important because they help minimize the risk to risk to quality, integration, interpretation, and protec- tion, which primarily occurs when data are being transferred and stored. \"While interfaces within a piece of equipment are optimized by the supplier, when that piece of equipment must inter- face with databases, control systems, or other equipment, there are challenges,\" Botonjic-Sehic observes. Standards describe how best to inte- grate data across the systems effec- tively and safely. \"There is guidance on communication standards, data for- matting, and even coding that helps to facilitate the process from PD to commercial scales,\" she notes. In addi- tion, the foundation should start with system design based on ISPE's Good Automated Manufacturing Practice (1) and integrate the data standards out - lined by regulatory agencies such as 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 11, Annex 11. Supplementary guidance and various industry communities of practice help build a strong solution on that foundation. Comprehensive information tech- nology solutions that provide the qual- ity control necessary but also engender compelling and innovative experi- ences\u2014the third layer\u2014can enable the right quality culture. \"Implementation of appropriate technical solutions should reduce friction in accomplishing tasks in addition to providing the array of business benefits, including data quality. If a solution is cumbersome or does not fully meet the business need, users will find a way to work around it, which will assuredly lead to less data integrity. The result can include data silos, dirty (i.e., invalid or incomplete) data, and thus, much more onerous data integration, interpretation, and security efforts,\" Andrews observes. The fourth layer involves validation. \"Where process development data are intended to support key decisions for processing at scale, validation\u2014of the systems used to collate information\u2014or secondary verification\u2014for manual lection\u2014should be performed quality,\" Seaver explains. Validation requires testing against pre-established criteria to confirm that the collection system performs as intended to ensure quality of the data. Manual adjustments made to the data set should be visible through an audit trail to protect against fraud and misinterpretation, Seaver adds. SOME TACTICS TO AVOID Because integration of data is a key component of how any piece of man- ufacturing equipment works, a strategy for integration must be built in from the start. Too often companies will Downstream Processing Contin. on page 22 SPONSORED CONTENT THOUGHT-LEADERSHIP FEATUREBiopharma Insights 20 March 2020 H ost cell proteins (HCPs) are the most critical process-related impurities in biologics. Due to their potential risk on prod - uct safety, efficacy, and quality, HCPs \"should be reduced to low ppm lev - els\" (1). HCP reduction is achieved through various purification steps designed to generate the highest possible yield of target protein with the lowest possible levels of HCPs. Thus, reproducible and reliable HCP information is essential in the development of efficient protein purification processes (2). Limitations of HCP-ELISA assays Classical HCP-ELISA provides an estimation of total HCP amount; however, complex purification buf - fers and the suitability of the anti - body reagents are critical parameters in the estimation. Since ELISA only provides limited information about the HCP content after each process step (a simple number), it provides poor guidance for how to improve the process. This results in time-consuming purification opti - mization and possible delays in clin - ical development. Therefore, a better tool could reduce development cost and time as well as ensure manufac-turing consistency. TOOL FOR EFFICIENT HCP CLEARANCE Health authorities increasingly request mass spectrometry (MS) for HCP analysis as an orthogonal method to ELISA. For the past five years, Alphalyse has developed and executed a growing number of HCP analysis projects based on SWATH\u00ae LC-MS. These analy - ses provide information for protein purification and process develop - ment of biologics. SWATH\u00ae LC-MS is a data- independent acquisition method that is especially suited for HCP analysis of in-process samples: Its large dynamic range detects low-abundance HCPs in large amounts of drug substance. It is highly reproducible and provides robust identification and quantification over time. It is suitable for complex samples in different buffers to compare process steps and batches. It is generic and rapidly adjusted to new bioprocesses. EXAMPLE OF DATA FROM SWATH\u00ae LC-MS BASED HCP ASSAY The SWATH\u00ae LC-MS method was used for the analysis of in-process samples of a drug substance expressed in E. coli inclusion bod - ies. The method is also useful for other expression systems such as CHO, yeast, and insect cells as well as human cell lines. The analysis was used for purification optimi - zation and batch comparison, and for PPQ validation of the process's robustness and reproducibility. Analysis of purification process samples The drug substance was puri - fied through a six-step process. By SWATH\u00ae LC-MS, the HCPs were identified and quantified in each process sample. Thus, the efficiency of each step and total clearance of HCPs were evaluated through the process (Figure 1). LC-MS for efficient and targeted purification Examples of the MW and pI of the 10 most abundant individual HCPs are listed in Table I. This informa - tion makes it easier to optimize a separation step, targeted at specific HCPs. Interestingly, all remaining HCPs after step six were small (<40 kDa) and acidic. The HCP details can be used to adjust individual pro-cess steps such as changing buffer pH or using a different cutoff during size exclusion. Using LC-MS for Efficient HCP Clearance Mass spectrometry for host cell protein removal. Figure 1. Host cell protein (HCP) amount (ppm) and number of identified HCPs measured by SWATH\u00ae LC-MS. THOUGHT-LEADERSHIP FEATUREBiopharma Insights SPONSORED CONTENT M arch 2020 21 List of identified HCPs with name, mass, and pI The most abundant HCPs are shown in Table I and the change in quantity of individual HCPs through the six steps is shown. The data includes the unique protein name, mass, and pI. This enables risk assessment of indi-vidual HCPs and targeting of specific physiochemical proper-ties of the remaining HCPs. The SWATH\u00ae LC-MS method is highly robust to differ-ent sample matrices and can be set up for a new biologic within weeks. Subsequent process sam-ples can be analyzed with the same method on an ongoing basis for further process develop-ment, process upscaling, or pro-cess transfer to a new CMO. METHOD CHARACTERISTICS The analysis is divided into three steps: sample preparation, MS analysis, and data analysis. Samples are prepared by adding internal protein standards, ace-tone precipitation, and trypsin digestion. Peptides are cleaned in SPE 96-well plates. The MS analysis is per- formed on a SCIEX TripleTOF\u00ae 6600 system. Samples are analyzed in techni-cal triplicates in data-dependent mode to generate peptide ion libraries and in data- indepen-dent mode for quantification. Finally, the obtained data is interpreted using ProteinPilot\u00ae and the SWATH microapp\u00ae for identification and label-free quantification of individual HCPs. Data-independent acquisition The MS-based HCP analysis is favorable in several ways: The high sensitivity enables detec-tion of HCP at low ppms. Further, the method is robust with no carry-over problem and the data independent acquisition method (SWATH\u00ae) ensures reproducibility. Finally, the use of multiple, intact internal stan-dard proteins and label-free quantification leads to abso-lute quantification of individual HCPs. Label-free quantification For HCP quantification, intact standard proteins are added prior to precipitation and digestion (i.e., undergoing the same processing as the HCPs). Dilution series of all standard proteins display a linear quanti-fication. The label free quantification by MS/MS signals are less likely to promote signal saturation compared with their MS precur-sors. Through generation of an ion library, peptides are assigned to their corresponding proteins. Quantification of each identi- fied protein is obtained by sum-ming the MS/MS intensity of all peptides in the specific pro-tein (SumAll quantification). REFERENCES 1.

Creating a ground-up strategy for implementation of standards and ease of integration is undoubtedly the best way.\" It is also important to avoid manip - ulation or analysis of the data in a separate program/system, according to Seaver. \"Doing so invalidates the quality controls provided through the original system validation. Secondary validation or manual verification would be required to ensure that all informa- tion has been transcribed correctly and is accurately represented following anal- ysis,\" he explains.Neglecting the quality of \"unregu- lated\" data, or those that are not neces- sarily required per an internal standard operating procedure or an external regulatory agency, is another common problem. The result, according to Andrews, can be unexpected down- stream quality failures. He also notes that, in general, not ensuring process development monitoring data quality represents a lost opportunity to learn and benefit from that data. THE PROMISE OF PAT During a bioprocess, many critical quality attributes (CQAs) and process parameters are monitored to ensure product quality. In traditional processes, samples are taken frequently by manual means and brought into analytical lab- oratories for testing to ensure product quality has been met; this carries for- ward throughout the process. These methods are labor-intensive, allow for operator error, and do not deliver real-time data, which inhibits their use in continuous bioprocesses, according to Botonjic-Sehic. \"Real-time data is extremely important for iden- tifying and mitigating process failures immediately and is necessary to com-plement the advances in continuous processing,\" she asserts. To help overcome this industry chal- lenge, Pall Biotech has been focusing on the evaluation and development of new process analytical technologies (PATs) that can measure CQAs in real-time. \"The goal is to remove any lag between identifying and mitigating a discrepancy in the process by bringing monitoring closer to the process. By automating analytics and enabling the automatic tracking and processing of data, integ- rity, and security are built into the pro- cess,\" observes Botonjic-Sehic.

JENNIFER MARKARIAN I ndustry experts have noted that there are limitations in the number of scalable technologies for viral-vector man- ufacturing and limited expertise in large-scale manufac- turing (1). Yet demand is growing, and flexible and efficient facilities will be needed for multi-product clinical and com- mercial manufacturing. \"In the viral vector space, there is diversity around differ- ent vector types (e.g., lentivirus [LV], adenovirus [AV], and adeno-associated virus [AAV]). It's critical to have a facility design that is flexible enough to adapt to product pipeline diversity,\" says Joe Makowiecki, Enterprise Solutions direc- tor of business development at GE Healthcare Life Sciences. MODULAR APPROACH Modular facility designs and modular construction are being used in biologics manufacturing, with a key benefit being faster time from inception to startup. The BioPhorum Group hosted an industry collaboration that proposed a standardized, modular design approach to help advance facility design in the industry (2). While the initial project looked at a mono-clonal antibody (mAb) facility, the team plans to extend the concept to cell and gene therapy production. GE Healthcare Life Sciences has amassed expertise in mod- ular design and construction with the use of its FlexFactory (a modular end-to-end biomanufacturing platform) as well as its KUBio facility (the FlexFactory inside of a prefabricated facility) for biologics production at facilities around the world. In 2019, the company introduced the KUBio Box\u2014a box-in- box approach, the FlexFactory platform in a modular facility intended to be placed inside a new or repurposed space or shell-building\u2014tailored for viral-vector-based gene therapies (3). \"Speed to market is critical for most, if not all, biologics. This is quite relevant in the gene therapy segment as many gene therapies are qualifying for orphan drug status or fast track designation status, shortening the drug development timeline from seven to 10 years for traditional biologics to three to five years,\" says Makowiecki. He says the KUBio box for viral vectors is a current good manufacturing practice (CGMP), biosafety level (BSL) 2 modular facility solution that can be delivered in 10 to 12 months.Manufacturing 24 BioPharm International M arch 2020 w ww.biopharminternational.comINCREASED BIOSAFETY REQUIREMENT Viral-vector manufacturing has some similarities to mAb manufacturing, but also some differences. \"Compared to mAbs, viral vectors are much larger, more complex molecules that are highly susceptible to various factors in their manufacturing environment, such as mechanical shear, pH, and tempera - ture,\" says Makowiecki. \"Viral vectors are typically more expensive to manu- facture as most viral vectors, due to their potential infectivity, require an increased BSL classification: BSL-2 classifica- tion for most viral vectors compared to BSL-1 classification for traditional mAbs. BSL 1 focuses on protection of the product from the operators and the environment, and BSL 2 focuses on containment, protecting the operators and the environment from the product. Increased biosafety level classification adds manufacturing and facility com - plexity and costs.\" RANGE OF SCALES Makowiecki says that many new facilities today are designed to use single-use tech- nologies and to produce multiple prod- ucts, which may require different sizes of equipment. \"There is quite a bit of vari- ability when it comes to viral vector man- ufacturing scales. It depends on the use of the vector (i.e., is it used as a reagent, as in the case of gene modified cell ther-apies, or is it the end drug product) and the indication (i.e., is it a local injection or a systemic dose). In the viral-vector space, we see process scales from one to 2000 L. There is less variability for lenti- virus and gamma retrovirus that is used for virally genetically modified cell ther- apies (ex-vivo gene therapies); the scale is mostly 50 L and currently doesn't go beyond 200 L. Whereas for in-vivo gene therapies, using mostly AAV, the scale varies depending on the patient popu- lation, disease type, and route of injec- tion, from a few 10 L up to 2000 L. For example, for Duchene muscular dystro- phy, the need (at current viral titers and downstream process recoveries) is about 200 L of production bioreactor culture per patient.\" The batch size influences the equipment size and number and, thus, the facility design, he notes. When larger batches are needed, either scale-up or scale-out is used, depending on the type of process. Makowiecki explains that vector pro- duction using adherent cells in fixed- bed bioreactors is limited in scale primarily by the size of the fixed-bed bioreactors, and scale-out is used to increase production volume. One option would be to convert to a suspension cell process and stirred tank bioreactors. Another option would be to use adher- ent cells with microcarriers in stirred- tank bioreactors. Both options typically do not have scale limitations and thus would allow for a more scalable process. The initial KUBio box for viral vector production was designed for a 200-L pro- cess scale, but Makowiecki says the com- pany intends to also design larger-scale KUBio boxes for viral vector production.MODULAR FACILITY SPEEDS CLINICAL RESEARCH In December 2019, GE Healthcare Life Sciences and the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) announced that they would install a large- scale viral vector manufacturing facility on the school's Worcester, MA campus to provide large quantities of high-quality AAV vectors for preclinical research. The 3220-ft2 facility will use a good laboratory practice (GLP) viral vector FlexFactory manufacturing platform. GE and UMMS said that the new capacity would help to alleviate the bottleneck of vector supply, as currently researchers potentially wait 12 to 24 months to obtain enough vectors for their research. The facility will be fully operational in 2020 (4). NEW FLEXIBLE FACILITIES \"Flexibility enables manufacturers to lever- age different technologies and systems in our plants, which can be beneficial when working with different manufac- turing platforms and different scales,\" says Christopher Murphy, vice-president and general manager for Viral Vector Services at Thermo Fisher Scientific, which acquired viral vector manufac - turer Brammer Bio in March 2019. The company has been busy expanding, and, in December 2019, it opened a 50,000- ft2 facility in Lexington, MA to provide capacity for the contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO) to support viral vector development and manufacturing (5). In November 2019, the company completed a $6-million expansion of its gene therapy and viral vector services facility in Alchua, FL that doubled the site's laboratory and ware- housing capacity for upstream process development and quality control testing of gene therapy products (6). \"Logistics and warehousing are vital to the success of our operations. We look to leverage centralized warehousing with just-in-time deliveries to our manufacturing plants,\" says Murphy.Manufacturing More on viral vectors For more on viral vector manufacturing, read the following articles on BioPharmInternational.com : C hallenges in Vector Purification for Gene Therapy www.BioPharmInternational. com/challenges-vector- purification-gene-therapy C ell Culture Variables for Gene Therapy Vectors www.BioPharmInternational. com/cell-culture-variables- gene-therapy-vectors P revent, Detect, and Remove: Viral Vectors www.BioPharminternational. com/prevent-detect-and- remove-viral-control-viral- vectors Contin. on page 41 ON-DEMAND WEBCAST: Aired Wednesday, February 26, 2020 Register for this free webcast at: http://www.biopharminternational.com/bio_p/real-timeReal-Time MALS: A Breakthrough in Process Analytical T Nanoparticles, Biopharmaceuticals, and Polymers Presenters Dr. Technology Corporation Moderator Rita PetersEditorial Director BioPharm International Sponsored by Presented by Who Should Attend Biochemical engineers responsible for implementing PAT in production processes Pharmaceutical development scientists involved in process development and scale-up of novel nanoparticle formats Production managers seeking advanced technologies for streamlining the production of biopharmaceuticals Event Overview Multi-angle light scattering (MALS) is primarily used with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) or field-flow fractionation (FFF) nanoparticles in solution. SEC-MALS and FFF-MALS determine distributions of molecular weight (MW) and size (rms radius, Rg), which are key attributes determining the quality of advanced pharmaceuti-cals and biopharmaceuticals such as monoclonal antibodies, vaccines, gene vectors, and nanoformulations of small-molecule drugs. Currently, most process development and lot-release methodologies are based on offline analytics, wherein test samples are sent to a remote lab to measure MW and Rg post-process by SEC-MALS or FFF-MALS, inevitably leading to delays and increased costs. This webcast introduces real-time MALS (RT-MALS), a novel process analytical technology that offers a first look at key quality attributes directly in the process stream. With RT-MALS, MW and Rg are measured to enable monitoring and control of the process according to actual product parameters, not just process parameters. RT-MALS can determine if an end point has been attained and the process is complete, or if the product deviates from acceptable criteria and the process must be terminated. In process development scenarios, RT-MALS provides immediate feedback on the impact of varying process parameters. This webcast will review the technology of RT-MALS, benefits and applications, and will feature case studies.

FELICITY THOMAS A ccording to market research, the global pharmaceutical analytical testing outsourcing market is projected to have strong growth from 2020 to 2027 (1). Drivers of this growth include an increase in demand for biopharmaceu - ticals, biosimilars, and analytical drugs, in addition to a general requirement for bio/pharma companies to streamline operations and reduce costs. To learn more about the criticality of stability testing through- out drug development, potential differences with small ver - sus large molecules, regulatory requirements, and future trends, BioPharm International spoke with Ramesh Jagadeesan, senior director of analytical development, Recipharm; and Karin Kottig, manager contract service analytics, Vetter Development Services. AN ESSENTIAL PART OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT BioPharm: Could you elaborate on the importance of sta- bility testing throughout the various development steps of drug products? Jagadeesan (Recipharm): Stability testing is one of the most crucial steps in the development of new drug products. By performing a series of analyses, testing programs can determine how long a product will maintain the properties and charac- teristics it possessed at the time of manufacture. The effect of environmental factors (such as temperature, light, and humidity) on a formulation's purity, efficacy, and structure is evaluated over time to define both its shelf-life and the necessary storage con- ditions. This information is vital for the regulatory approval of a new medicine. Stability studies are conducted during all phases of drug devel- opment. They typically start at the preclinical stage of drug devel- opment and continue through Phase I-Phase III clinical trials to support formulation development, and to satisfy the regulatory requirements for clinical trials. However, the purpose of the stud- ies and regulatory requirements vary depending on the product type, the phase of the program, and the intended markets. The first stage of stability testing usually takes the form of forced-degradation studies. These studies help to identify the ideal formulation from a host of different candidates to take forward for further testing. The aim of this is to understand the primary degradation products of a molecule and aid analysts in Analytics www.biopharminternational.com M arch 2020 BioPharm International 27selecting the best methods for further sta- bility tests, which mimic real-life storage in different global regions. Long-term sta- bility studies will subsequently be initiated and validated on both the API and the drug product. In short, the aim of the stability testing process is to produce data that demonstrates whether any physical, chemical, or microbiological changes affect the efficiency and integrity of a pharmaceutical product. This helps to ensure medicines are safe and effective, irrespective of where in the world they are supplied. Kottig (Vetter): Stability studies are an essential and vital part of drug devel- opment. They are necessary throughout all phases with stringent timelines for analytical testing. The purpose of the studies is to prove how the quality of an API or drug product changes over the course of time while under the influ- ence of environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, or light. Stability studies also support the determination of the re-test date of the active ingredient, shelf-life of the drug product, suitable packaging materials, and recommended storage conditions. With respect to new drug applications, submissions for approval by regulatory authorities are required to contain data from stability studies conducted on both the drug substance and the drug product. During drug development, this assess- ment is performed with the help of a vari- ety of well-designed stability studies in the different development phases. During early development, stability studies are performed on technical batches as well as on clinical samples. These include, for example, stress and accelerated studies of the drug substance and product to support setup of formulation, selection of primary packaging, and production process. In later phases, transport and cycling stud- ies as well as long-term and accelerated studies with registration batches are real - ized. All data are compiled to generate the expiration date of the drug and, finally, to obtain the market authorization. After product launch, follow-up sta- bility studies of market batches are con- ducted on a regular basis. The studies are also necessary after post-approval changes. In this way, they significantly influence the entire lifecycle of a product. Ultimately, they are essential to provide a drug and thus the health of the patient by supplying a stable product with consistent quality. SMALL VERSUS LARGE MOLECULE BioPharm: Are there specific differ - ences in terms of stability testing for small-molecule versus large-molecule products? Kottig (Vetter): From complex and highly sensitive substances to vaccines and biotechnologically produced proteins, the manufacturing of drug products demands a high-degree of expertise and flexibility to perform all the necessary and prod- uct-specific processes prior to the inde- pendent completion of the final product. Thus, stability testing required for ensur- ing a product is fit for use are adapted on a case-by-case basis. The increasing number of biologics in clinical development has had a significant impact on analytical methods and has brought forth new scientific challenges. When it comes to injectables, biologics are placed into a small volume of liquid that often requires a very high concentra-tion. This leads to unique stability issues related to aggregation, viscosity, and ther-mal degradation. And, while still relatively complex, it is usually a straightforward process to demonstrate the identity, cor- rect content, and purity of small-molecule drugs and the correlated products. The evaluation of the quality of a biological, large-molecule product requires much more complex analytical and bioanalytical methods. From my point of view, the increased focus on particulate matter is also cor- related to large-molecule products as they are often very sensitive. Aggregation, as well as interactions with other com- ponents such as excipients and packag - ing material, for example, could lead to increased particulate matter formation. These particulates will then be analyzed with different analytical methods. Jagadeesan (Recipharm): The development of an appropriate stability testing program typically considers the specific nature of the product being eval- uated. Based upon the constituent com- pounds and knowledge of how they are impacted by storage and environmen- tal conditions, the degradation dynamics of small-molecule products are predict- able. The rise of newer, large-molecule drugs developed using biotechnology has brought new scientific challenges for sta-bility testing. The greater complexity of large-mol- ecule products, combined with more batch-to-batch variance and specialized storage conditions, makes typical stabil- ity study conditions unsuitable. To this end, bespoke stability testing programs need to be designed for each product. Biopharmaceuticals are generally highly concentrated and/or less soluble, which increases the likelihood that the API will precipitate during stability studies. Clear, quality data surrounding this process are essential to ensuring regulatory compliance. In addition, small-molecule degrada - tion pathways are more predictable and shelf-life specifications are set based on the toxicological studies. Whereas, with biopharmaceuticals, degradation pathways are much more unpredictable, and they differ for different proteins. For example, some parenteral biologics administered for patients are highly concentrated, so they may precipitate during the stability studies. Biopharmaceuticals are often only sta- ble over a very limited temperature range, meaning that excursions/temperature deviations outside the optimum storage conditions can have a significant impact on stability. To this end, they should be stored within an extremely narrow tem- perature range to avoid an impact on biological activity. Testing the stability of such sensitive products in a range of tem- peratures needs to be carefully planned to take actual storage conditions into con- sideration. Additionally, the stability of Analytics 28 BioPharm International M arch 2020 w ww.biopharminternational.comproteins often calls for other analytical methods other than the liquid chroma- tography that is frequently used for small organic molecules. REGULATORY EXPECTATIONS BioPharm: What are the regulatory expectations for stability testing? Jagadeesan (Recipharm): The International Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) has established stability testing guide- lines that provide comprehensive guid- ance on registration stability requirements for new drug applications in the ICH regions. These guidelines recommend different testing protocols for climatic zones around the globe. For example, storage stability tests can range from temperatures as low as -80\u00b0 C to 40\u00b0 C, with relative humidity up to 75%. The ICH guidelines have been adapted by many regulatory agencies including the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and FDA for its abbreviated new drug appli- cations pathway. There are, however, marked differences in the specific stability data required by authorities in each market. As a result, testing programs should be developed with the specific market in mind. For example, despite authorities in the United States and European Union (EU) adopt- ing the same standards, they set different microbiological limits for stability tests. In addition, some assessments that can be omitted in the US are mandatory in the EU and vice versa. Stability testing of pharmaceutical products is mandatory for regulatory approvals. If a product fails to meet the standards prescribed by the ICH, as well as those defined by the World Health Organization, the product will not be granted approval for commercialization. Planning, execution, and completion of studies in given timelines plays a major role in securing approval and ensuring a product reaches patients. Kottig (Vetter): Drug stability is not simply a requirement of the regulations. Rather, stability testing operations are a 'window' for the development program of the product and the assurance of quality. Practically all regulatory requirements for drug stability testing are clearly described in [good manufacturing practices] GMP guidelines. Today, stability plans include far more than just the determination of an expiration date for a pharmaceutical prod- uct. They also require a written stabil- ity testing program that specifies sample sizes and test intervals, controlled stor - age conditions, validated and specific test methods, and specifications. Furthermore, requirements stipulate that an adequate number of drug production batches are tested. In addition, it is mandatory to per- form stability testing of the product in its marketed container or closure system. There has been considerable harmoni- zation of regulatory guidelines, with the ICH pharmaceutical stability guidelines now recognized as the globally accepted industry standard. ICH provides practical guidance on the amount and the type of drug substance and drug product stability data needed to support marketing appli - cations. The included quality guidelines Q1A-Q1F have made a major contri- bution to increasing the quality of phar - maceuticals and are applicable for small molecules. Generally speaking, they apply to large-molecule products as well. ICH Q5C takes into consideration the spe- cific characteristics of biotechnological/ biological products. These large-mole- cule products are typically more sensi- tive than small-molecule products and require complex analytical methods to demonstrate that their molecular con - formation is maintained during shelf life. For example, a potency assay is required to prove biological activity is maintained. Usually, more than one analytical method is needed to prove purity of the product. FUTURE TRENDS BioPharm: As molecules in develop- ment become more complex and difficult to deal with, what trends do you predict may impact the industry over the next 5-10 years in the area of stability testing? Jagadeesan (Recipharm): As the demand for biopharmaceuticals increase, even more efficient methods will need to be in place for the assessment of pro-tein activity. This makes it necessary to have access to more analytical technol- ogy compared to when handling small molecules, where liquid chromatogra- phy can fulfill most analytical needs. A great challenge in product devel- opment is the time it takes to ensure stability. There is a significant need for methods that enable the prediction of the stability of a formulation at an early stage as this will allow companies to shorten development timelines and reduce the risk of unforeseen challenges later on in stability studies. While APIs are growing in com- plexity, there is also a trend towards more complex formulations, such as nanoparticles, microemulsions, and amorphous formulations to give acceptable solubility and bioavail-ability. For these formulations, phys - ical-chemical characteristics, in particular solid-state characteristics, are very important; hence, this leads to the need for more physical-chemical characterization during stability studies. Kottig (Vetter): When address- ing the challenges of increased com-plexity of molecules in development in combination with even shorter timeframes for drug development and smaller batch sizes, the pharmaceutical and biotech industry should collabo- rate with regulatory bodies to gener- ate meaningful risk-based guidance. Holistic approaches will require good data management and integrated sys- tems to collect, manage, and process data to effectively support stability analyses in the future. REFERENCE 1.

Analytics www.biopharminternational.com M arch 2020 BioPharm International 29Gorodenkoff/Stock.Adobe.com Navigating GMPs for Gene Therapies While new industry guidance documents issued by FDA speak to the agency's efforts to promote the development of new gene therapies, certain hurdles remain to challenge stakeholders. FELIZA MIRASOL T he focus on developing emerging therapies, especially cell and gene therapies, has intensified, making the need for good manufacturing practices (GMP) guid- ance more imperative. In its specific efforts to promote the development of novel gene therapies, FDA published six final guidance documents on gene therapy manufacturing and clinical development and released a draft guidance on gene therapy products under orphan drug regulations in January 2020. To date, the agency has approved four gene therapy products (1). GUIDANCE CHALLENGES How do these new FDA guidance documents help gene therapy developers and contract service providers navigate the challenges of gene therapy development and manufac-turing? The Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) Information for Human Gene Therapy Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) (2) guidance, for one, provides a comprehensive framework to guide the development of a broad range of products, says Karen Magers, head of Regulatory Affairs Cell and Gene Therapy Technologies, Lonza. The guidance document provides many recommen-dations that help to clarify the expectations for product development, characterization, manufacturing, and testing of these products, she points out. \"Stakeholders, including Lonza, submitted comments [to FDA] requesting clarification on the information to be sub- mitted prior to a first-in-human clinical study and information to be submitted in a phased approach, as more manufacturing experience is obtained during product clinical development. FDA acknowledged in the final document that 'informa- tion may be limited in the early phases of development and recommends that sponsors provide additional information and updates as product development proceeds',\" she states. However, because limited specific recommendations and exam- ples were provided in the guidance, there are remaining chal- lenges in determining the requirements for first-in-human studies and subsequent clinical studies, she continues. Others note that, with the guidance documents, the challenges to gene therapy development and manufacturing are what they have always been. \"I don't think there is any- thing unexpected in the final CMC guidance,\" says James Blackwell, PhD, principal consultant and president of The Windshire Group, a Boston, MA-based biopharmaceutical Quality/Regulations 30 BioPharm International M arch 2020 w ww.biopharminternational.comconsulting group. \"The challenges are what they have always been. However, there are numerous challenges posed in the guidance for developers.\" Blackwell narrows down challenges his group has experienced, which will likely be the same experiences that other stakeholders in gene therapy development will also experience. First, for any combination product or poten- tial combination gene therapy prod- uct, developers should carefully assess the available guidance and make early assessments in the program because the regulatory and documentation requirements can vary significantly for various components. \"For areas of doubt, one should engage the Health Authorities early. This can be a chal- lenging area for emerging technolo- gies,\" Blackwell says. Blackwell also points out that there is a higher burden, compared to tra - ditional products, for gene therapies to understand critical attributes and parameters earlier in the development cycle while trying to establish as robust of a process as early as possible. This burden stems from the complexity of a gene therapy product. \"The benefits of doing so are dual. First, you minimize the need for change later and, if change is needed, you have a more solid basis for rationalizing and approaching it to minimize impact to development timelines. The latter point is always important but will be a key consideration for many of these pro-grams,\" Blackwell states. \"Containers used for drug substance and drug product need to be closely scrutinized for products that can't be filtered,\" he continues. \"The level of particulates may not be controlled as closely as needed during the manu- facture of these components, and the particulates will end up in your prod- uct if not controlled or removed in advance. For some of these suppliers, a gene therapy developer represents such a small part of their overall busi- ness that the supplier will not accom-modate changes deemed necessary by the developer. Particulates and their potential to cause adverse events have been the subject of increasing regula- tory scrutiny.\" GUIDANCE BENEFITS The bottom line to having these gene therapy guidance documents, however, is to facilitate not only the develop- ment and current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) compliance of gene therapies, but also the regulatory pathway to drug approval. \"I've found the guidances, including these, to be invaluable to understanding expecta- tions. One thing that stands out to me in these guidelines was the num- ber of places the agency understood there may be differences in approach or technical, practical, and scientific lim- itations to meeting the ideal require- ments of the guidances,\" Blackwell emphasizes. \"Still, in those situations, know- ing what the expectation is helps one develop a rationale, data set, and construct that address the issue and why the alternate approach does not represent a risk to the safety, identity, strength, purity, and quality (SISPQ) of the product,\" he adds. The two guidance documents (2,3) that include CMC-specific rec- ommendations also provide clarity on many aspects related to the man- ufacturing and testing requirements for gene therapy products, Magers asserts. \"[These] documents provide both general guidelines and specific recommendations. As an example of a general guideline, FDA provided information supporting the classifica- tion of viral vectors. Comments on the draft Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) Information for Human Gene Therapy Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs) document sought this clarification. In the final version, FDA cited regulation to confirm their position that a vector 'used to trans- duce cells ex vivo and which furnishes a pharmacological activity for the treatment of disease is a critical com- ponent. Without the vector, the result-ing cell product would not have the same pharmacological activity. Similarly, a vector in its final formulation for administration of the genetic material is generally considered a DP [drug prod- uct]',\" Magers cites. She notes that FDA gave examples of specific vector recommendations, which include replication competent retrovirus (RCR) testing of cell banks, vector-harvested material, and ex-vivo transduced cells. FDA had also given an example of the derivation in its rec- ommendation for an appropriate test volume for RCR detection. MOVING FORWARD PAST THE HURDLES At present, there are still hurdles to overcome in the manufacturing of gene therapies, and a number of bio- pharmaceutical companies as well as contract manufacturing organizations/contract development and manufac- turing organizations are tackling these challenges. For one, gene therapy (and cell ther- apy) manufacturing is still a highly manual aseptic manufacturing process, which poses several challenges, says Quality/Regulations \"I've found the guidances, including these, to be invaluable to understanding expectations.\" \u2014James Blackwell, The Windshire Group www.biopharminternational.com M arch 2020 BioPharm International 31Magers. It is important to consider the correct and functional layout of cleanrooms and the number of trained operators needed for those cleanrooms, he points out. She also emphasizes the high importance of ensuring the quali- fication of sterile consumables and raw materials because, often, only research- grade material is available and there is no GMP material available to replace them when manufacturing is scaled up. \"We are also observing a high investment in infrastructure and facil-ities in contrast to low throughput areas (personalized medicine, small batch sizes\u2014down to one batch per patient), as well as unclear expecta- tions for concurrent manufacturing of several batches and product segrega- tion strategies,\" Magers notes. Navigating the regulatory landscape and complying with regulations can be difficult as an international manu- facturer, Magers also observes. \"There are three main regulatory systems: European Union (EU) GMP regula- tions, United States (US) GMP regu- lations, and Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) reg- ulations,\" she states. \"The new Good Manufacturing Practice Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practice Specific to Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (EU GMP part IV) (4) does not pro- vide the most straightforward guid- ance and expectations. Moreover, it refers to risk management, which is not easy to navigate, as the perception of risk is subjective to a certain extent.\" Magers also points out that these new EU guidelines exclude the link and reference to GMPs for other pharmaceuticals, including in Annex 1, Manufacture of Sterile Medicinal Products (Corrected Version) (5). \"However, the PIC/S and the US will not adapt to this move. Therefore, the 'classical' pharmaceutical regulations apply to products that will be licensed in those regions. Furthermore, many countries are part of more than one of these regulatory systems (e.g., EU GMP and PIC/S, US regulations and PIC/S); navigating through expecta- tions from different regulatory bodies will soon arise and need to be com- plied with,\" she adds. \"I think one of the biggest chal- lenges will be the complexity of the supply chain demands, both on the front end (starting with supply of materials or patient samples) and back-end (delivery to the patient),\" observes Blackwell. \"Some of these products and tech- nologies use relatively novel materials, and the suppliers are not mature from the standpoint of their manufacturing processes and quality systems. In some cases, the sponsor will need to help the supplier and improve and reduce risk. The bar keeps getting raised as the products enter Phase III and com- mercial manufacturing. So how these critical components will be sourced in a compliant manner needs to be assessed early in development and planned for with risk-reduction strat- egies,\" Blackwell adds. Blackwell brings up another source of compliance complexity: data integ- rity requirements and management of these data from patient, to testing and manufacturing, and back to patient. \"Now imagine that this is all happen- ing by paper documentation now. As patient loads increase in clinical tri- als, managing this and avoiding and dealing with mistakes becomes hercu- lean, if not impossible. The integra- tion of compliant electronic tracking and data-sharing technologies from patient to lab, to manufacturing, and back to patient is paramount and a challenge,\" he stresses. Further, the definition of the \"control space\" around the product is becoming another hurdle. For traditional prod- ucts the \"control space\" has entailed batch manufacturing, batch area clear- ance, and various room checks to limit the risk of cross contamination and product mixups. For many of the newer technologies, Blackwell asserts, the tra-ditional manufacturing model simply won't be economical. \"The control space around the product will need to shrink to accom- modate simultaneous and parallel manufacturing on the same produc- tion floor. Again, the interplay of data technologies (e.g., radio frequency identification, wireless, mobile, barcode, manufacturing execution system) and engineered controls (e.g., electronic batch records) to ensure compliance and the SISPQ of the product will be essential. These systems will need to interact with the quality system in real time and be validated to sup-port release by exception. Unexpected events will need to be investigated immediately and alerted by the elec- tronic process monitoring systems,\" Blackwell explains. BEST PRACTICES ARE NEEDED Gene therapy stakeholders would do well to have a set of best practices that will help keep the development of a novel gene therapy in compliance with new regulatory guidelines. Early and frequent use of risk assessments is a good practice that can greatly enhance process understanding and focus efforts, for instance. Gene therapy, as well as other emerging therapy prod- ucts, required a broad and deep under- standing of the science behind them in order to do proper risk assessments, Blackwell says. \"This will often entail close collaboration between R&D sci- entists, process scientists, and quality control, especially early in the develop- ment program before little process data and manufacturing history has been garnered,\" he adds. Blackwell considers that stakehold- ers for a number of these products will seek expedited approval pathways, which will compound the challenges with CMC because of the shortened timelines. He notes that it is always challenging to keep CMC off the crit- ical pathway under any circumstance, and when these pathways get expe-Quality/Regulations 32 BioPharm International M arch 2020 w ww.biopharminternational.comdited, the pressures on CMC activities are enormous. Unfortunately, there will be no relief from FDA in terms of meeting the expectations and spirit of the guidance documents. \"Again, stra- tegic and project planning that links to the data and technical reports require- ment and regulatory expectations is clearly a best practice,\" Blackwell says. Blackwell believes it is helpful to always keep the end-goal (i.e., commer- cialization) in mind. \"Is a change really needed now, or can it wait until after approval and commercial launch? But, having the end-in-mind is not enough. Starting early with a strategic and proj- ect plan focused on regulatory require- ments and guidance pays tremendous dividends. It helps to make sure things are not overlooked, and helps the team make appropriate adjustments quickly when things don't go as planned. They almost never do,\" he says. Another best practice Blackwell rec- ommends, though on a different tact, relates to process, equipment, and facil- ity validation. \"Many of these processes will need to scale up on parallel and not in scale like traditional products. Thus, the master validation plan should accommodate this by simplifying the level of qualification needed for new product lines and suites,\" Blackwell says. He also advocates using quali- ty-by-design and product lifecycle approaches, which are the best ways to meet all these challenges. \"For example, the target product profile is one of the few tools in an organization that brings most of the key stakeholders together, including commercial, medical, CMC, regulatory, and quality; keeps everyone on the same page; and focuses efforts. Start early with it since it becomes a living document that has the end-in- mind,\" Blackwell states. GUIDELINES STILL NEEDED Meanwhile, although the new gene therapy guidelines issued by FDA are a significant step forward in moving new gene therapies through the regu- latory process toward approval, some note that further GMP guidelines are still needed. Magers points out that although GMP requirements have been issued that are specific to gene therapy products, FDA has not yet issued a guidance document that con- tains detailed GMP recommendations. The EC's GMP guidelines for advanced therapy medicinal prod- ucts (4) that went into effect in May 2018 contain detailed recommen- dations, Magers observes. \"Some of these recommendations were included in the PIC/S GMP Guide Annex 2A Manufacture of Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products for Human Use (6), which was issued for public comment from September to December 2019. FDA is providing recommendations to address specific topics (e.g., recom- mendations for multiproduct cell and gene therapy manufacturing facilities) in public forums, however, no guidelines have been issued,\" Magers states. \"In addition, it would be beneficial if FDA would update some CMC guid- ance documents to reflect their current thinking. Guidelines that should be updated include the Content and Review of Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Control (CMC) Information for Human Somatic Cell Therapy Investigational New Drug Applications (INDs), issued April 2008, and the Potency Tests for Cellular and Gene Therapy Products Final Guidance for Industry, issued January 2011. Further, a guideline addressing comparability approaches for cell and gene therapy products is needed, as changes are often made during the development of these products that require an assess- ment of comparability,\" Magers adds. Blackwell points to an area where future guidance will likely be needed, and that is in \"bedside manufactur- guidances, and technology will be pushed to its limits to ensure the SISPQ of the product is ensured. Guidances that will be particularly use- ful will be on process analytic tech- nology (PAT), CFR [Code of Federal Regulations] Part 11, and risk assess- ment, but I expect new guidance that tie these together in conjunction with these types of technologies will be needed. For example, how will the quality unit oversee and interact with these technologies? What will be deemed acceptable? Appropriate engineering controls; analytics, testing, and release; validation; data integrity; handling unexpected events; handling and control over the manufacturing equipment will be especially challeng- ing,\" he concludes.

RITA PETERS T he \"fail fast\" approach to drug discovery and develop- ment works on the premise that the sooner you know a molecule will not have the desired efficacy, safety, or performance, the faster you can move on to another candidate, saving time and money. While a molecule may look promising in early development studies, are drug developers confident that formulation or manufacturing challenges won't create a \"fail later\" situation? In the traditional approach to drug development, com- panies race to get molecules to clinic, postponing questions about formulation and manufacturability until formulation steps later in the clinical phases. This traditional approach may work for easy-to-formulate APIs that can be delivered via an oral dosage form. For more complex biologic drugs, the task is not that simple. Formulation and development experts from contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) note that the race to clinic and beyond may tempt drug companies to take shortcuts that end up costing more along the path to commercialization. Formulation studies require time, money, and expertise\u2014 resources that may not be available for smaller drug compa-nies in early research phases. Development-phase companies anxious to get to clinic may seek to gain an advantage by postponing early stage formulation development. Formulation groundwork, however, can identify the best drug candidates, allow for optimization of the molecule, and reveal potential roadblocks in the manufacturing process. \"Companies desiring to sell early stage assets should con- sider that buyers expect to see formulation and manufacturing process development results that demonstrate the product can be commercialized,\" says Eugene McNally, vice president, consulting, PPD. For small-molecule drugs, detailed preformulation studies can help drug developers understand a molecule's physi-cochemical characteristics, solid-state characteristics, and dissolution rate, says Robert W. Lee, president of Lubrizol Life Science Health's CDMO division. Biologics are more complex with aggregation and degradation of special con-cern, as they are much more sensitive to stresses from man- ufacturing and environmental conditions; typically, biologics require extensive pre-formulation studies, says Stuart Madden, vice-president, drug development and consulting, ICON. Outsourcing 34 BioPharm International M arch 2020 w ww.biopharminternational.com\"For large molecules, it's not just the sequence of the monomers (i.e., amino acids or nucleotides) that is a concern but also the three-dimensional structure,\" says Lee. \"During formulation develop- ment, it's important to track this 3-D structure as this may be key to its bio- logical activity, and this may very well be impacted by the formulation.\" An indi- cation of solution stability, and whether a lyophilized, or dried, formulation will be needed to maintain stability, is typi- cally the starting point for development of large molecules, adds McNally. In addition to analytic studies, a range of predictive modeling programs can help determine dose frequency, for- mulation, and route of administration for clinical trials, assess stability, bio- availability, and genotoxicity, and phar- macokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The decision to divert limited resources from early formulation stud- ies can come back to haunt many drug developers. For example, poorly solu- ble compounds can add up to an extra year on the development timeline, notes Darren Matthews, research leader, phar- maceutical sciences, Charles River. \"It is critical for companies to under- stand that investing in formulation and process development during the early phases can yield dividends in the long run,\" says Sanjay Konagurthu, senior director, Thermo Fisher Scientific- Pharma Services Group. \"The company should obtain a mechanistic under-standing of the formulation and process.\" COMMON PITFALLS Whether due to oversight, lack of knowledge, or lack of resources, fail- ure to fully understand the molecule in development and how it will be man- ufactured are common mistakes small biopharma companies make. \"Even seemingly straightforward projects can reveal issues at a later stage,\" says Lee. \"The more information you have about molecules early on, the decisions you make can be better informed to further your probability of success.\"Not performing the testing, to either save money, secure funding, or com- press the timeline, is the most common mistake observed by Matthews. \"As a result, the formulation scientist must solve these challenges through formu- lation strategies, with no guarantee of success, as opposed to fixing the chem- istry early on, which would have been an option pre-candidate nomination. The net result is significantly more cost and time added to a project.\" \"Falling into the 'sunk cost' trap can be one of the biggest mistakes for a small company, especially if it is their only asset. Not every molecule that performs well in early in-vitro testing will have the appropriate characteristics to be a drug,\" explains Lisa Caralli, director of science and technology, pharmaceutics, Catalent Pharma Solutions, San Diego. \"Engaging formulators in discussions with medicinal chemists earlier in dis- covery/asset acquisition will help select the right molecules for development.\" \"Companies need to consider perfor- mance, stability, and manufacturability the get-go says Konagurthu. \"While product devel- opment scientists commonly work on formulations and stability in the early development phases, manufacturabil - ity is not always a priority. Scale-up is not always trivial or predictable unless process knowledge is developed that is scale-independent. This knowledge should guide equipment selection, link the critical process parameters to criti-cal quality attributes, and establish the design space.\" Two errors small companies make, identified by Madden, are not hav-ing a clear understanding of the tar- get product profile; and going into the clinic with poorly formulated or poorly characterized drugs that can lead to erroneous or misleading data sets. \"CMC [chemistry, manufacturing, and controls] is an area that can often be neglected by small companies, particu- larly where an asset has been acquired from a larger pharma partner,\" Madden says. \"Additionally, small companies sometimes fail to understand scale-up and tech transfer requirements, partic- ularly where they plan to commercialize a product.\" \"Prioritizing thoughtful protocol development from the outset can lead to much more efficient studies that not only ensure the drug exhibits the char- acteristics desired in the target product profile, but also save time and money,\" explains Scott Dove, vice president, early development, PPD. KNOW YOUR SPECIALTIES\u2014 AND LIMITATIONS With resources\u2014inhouse expertise, instruments, equipment, time, and funding\u2014at a premium, small bio/ pharma companies face difficult deci- sions about what functions to conduct internally and which ones to outsource. Small companies should consider possible limitations to their resources, says Dove, and assess the knowledge and expertise of internal staff to handle challenges that may occur. \"Early devel- opment requires an investment in lab space, instrumentation, and manpower, which can be costly,\" he says. \"Small companies often have limited capital. Strategic investment analysis should be done to determine which investment will best help them achieve their long- term goals.\" \"If the small company has specific, specialized, internal capabilities with respect to aspects of its development Outsourcing Analytic studies and predictive modeling can help determine dose frequency, formulation, and administration. www.biopharminternational.com M arch 2020 BioPharm International 35program, it is likely to be cost effec- tive to keep these in-house, especially if these activities are not germane to the drug product's quality assessment and the data are not required to be devel- oped under [current good manufactur- ing practices] CGMPs, which would carry a heavy overhead,\" says Madden. \"Routine GMP activities can be out- sourced. There is a healthy CDMO market for choices.\" If a company's internal team lacks first-hand experience, it should consider outsourcing to subject matter experts, recommends Caralli. \"A few people are asked to wear many hats in lean com- panies, and recognizing the knowledge gaps is essential.\" Outsourcing can be a way to fill gaps in an organization's skill base. \"If you're working with an unfamiliar route of administration or with compounds that possess challenging physicochemical characteristics, engaging a partner with the relevant expertise and experience can help you avoid many pitfalls and speed up your programs,\" says Matthews. The business objectives and capa- bilities of a small company play a key role in the decision to outsource. \"For completely virtual companies, every task has to be outsourced as they do not have any internal capabilities,\" says Konagurthu. \"For companies that have some internal capabilities, consider - ations such as R&D vs. GMP equip- ment and capabilities, experience in CMC, clinical phase of development, formulation and process development experience, manufacturing scale require- ments, timelines, and other business objectives govern decision making.\" In addition to questions about what tasks to outsource is the matter of when to seek external assistance. \"As a CDMO, our preference is to get involved as early as possible in the development process as sometimes clients spend a long time heading down the wrong path and come up with suboptimal formulations that need fixing,\" says Lee. \"Transferring these suboptimal formulations over to us and asking us to fix them can cost more money and time than if they had just come to us earlier on in the process.\" For small companies that have in-house expertise in preclinical formu - lation development, it makes sense to start work internally; those companies that lack this skill should outsource as soon as possible, says Lee. \"It's also more cost effective to outsource to an estab- lished development partner rather than building missing infrastructure in-house, particularly for smaller companies.\" FINDING A SUITABLE PARTNER Using a CDMO that offers multiple contract service functions including drug substance manufacturing, drug product development, commercializa- tion, clinical packaging, and distribution offers the convenience of all functions\u2014 and responsibility\u2014with one vendor. A lower burden of supplier oversight and technology transfer can be beneficial for small companies. \"Some [contract research organi- zations] CROs have broad offerings that mean you can place many, or all, of the various studies you require with the same supplier, cutting down on the administrative burden of coordinating work and sample transfer between mul- tiple partners,\" suggests Matthews. In the competitive drug develop- ment environment, what can small bio/pharma companies do to ensure their molecule is getting the attention it deserves from a contract service pro- vider? The answer involves both pro - cesses and people.Madden suggests taking a three- pronged approach. First, have a well-de- fined contract with specific activities, deliverables, and timelines. Second, he says, \"ensure a CMO project manager is assigned to the project and there is a regular project meeting timetable with agenda, action items, and minutes, etc. It is incumbent on the biotech to also have a project manager to ensure the continuity of the project for the biotech. Finally, there should be a senior-level relationship for resolution of any issues that can't be resolved by the team.\" Meredith Perry, director of pharma- ceutics, Catalent Pharma Solutions, San Diego, recommends asking the contract laboratory how they schedule work and assign resources, both for R&D and for manufacturing, so that there is trans- parency up front. \"Ask for a main point of contact such as a scientist or project manager, so that you always have some- one at the CDMO who will advocate for your project's needs,\" she says. A strategy for a small biopharma company to ensure that it is not over- shadowed by big project at a CDMO is to \"do your due diligence,\" stresses Lee. \"Ensure that you evaluate an array of CDMOs and speak to peers who have worked with them,\" he says. \"It's true that certain CDMOs priori- tize large-volume projects but it's not the case across the board,\" Lee continues. \"If you are a smaller company, you will want to work with a CDMO that understands the criticality of your program. In some cases, companies only have one com- pound, which makes choosing a CDMO perhaps one of the most critical tasks in the development program.\" \"Focus on relationship building,\" rec- ommends Caralli. \"People want to work with others who appreciate each other's contributions and with whom they feel part of a team. Do not use a CDMO as solely an extra pair of hands. People will bend over backwards when they have a personal connection, so the size of a company or their financial resources matter less.\" Outsourcing The business objectives and capabilities of a small company play a role in the decision to outsource. 36 BioPharm International M arch 2020 w ww.biopharminternational.com Igor/Stock.Adobe.com The Costs of Commercializing CRISPR As patent disputes within the scientific community continue, drug developers consider the intellectual property unknowns associated with this emerging technology. KEVIN E. NOONAN T echnology utilizing clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, or CRISPR, has the poten- tial to be one of the most revolutionary\u2014or danger- ous\u2014genetic manipulation technologies ever developed. It provides researchers with the ability to edit genetic infor- mation\u2014including both structural genes encoding proteins, as well as regulatory sequences that control when a gene is expressed, how much is expressed, and in what tissue\u2014in ways heretofore only more crudely practiced, such as by introducing a heterologous gene into a new cellular envi- ronment. While these earlier methods were extremely useful, permitting, for example, the production of commercially sufficient quantities of proteins such as erythropoietin, inter- feron, and a variety of peptide hormones, CRISPR permits alteration of gene expression directly in a desired host to provide a desired effect. It thus has implications for agricul- ture to increase yield or reduce allergens, as well as human medicine.CRISPR was first reported by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier in 2012 (1), as an outgrowth of their work on bacterial immunity against bacteriophage viruses at the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Vienna; they showed genetic editing could be achieved at spe- cific sites in known genetic sequences in vitro. They did not explicitly show that CRISPR could edit genes in eukaryotic cells (i.e., almost every type and species of cell except bacteria) in their earliest published work, although applying CRISPR to eukaryotic DNA was envisioned and there is some evi- dence that the earliest efforts in achieving eukaryotic CRISPR were unsuccessful. The first scientific publication demonstrat- ing that CRISPR could be effectively practiced in eukaryotic cells was by Zhang and colleagues at The Broad Institute, KEVIN E. NOONAN is a partner with McDonnell Boehnen Hulbert & Berghoff LLP and serves as co-chair of the firm's biotechnology and pharmaceuticals practice group. BioBusiness www.biopharminternational.com M arch 2020 BioPharm International 37MIT, and Harvard University; thereaf- ter, several groups reported successful eukaryotic CRISPR results (2). Both The Broad Institute and California, Vienna, and Charpentier (CVC) groups accompanied their scien- tific work with patent applications. This is because both groups, and their uni- versities, realized that in order to bring this technology to market there must be a reasonable likelihood of being able to recoup a sufficiently robust return on investment; this reasonable likelihood depends on having patent protection. Both groups claimed inventorship over CRISPR applications to eukaryotic cells, which encompasses the majority of the most promising applications of the technology, and in the face of their competing claims the US Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) instituted an interference proceeding to make the determination of who invented eukary- otic CRISPR first. On Sept. 10, 2018, the outcome of the first of these interferences seem- ingly resolved the question, albeit imperfectly: the PTO decided (and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed)(3) that Broad and their collaborators had the rights to eukaryotic CRISPR applications and rights to CRISPR more generally were owned by the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Vienna, and Emmanuelle Charpentier as an indi - vidual. PTO determined there was no interference between the parties because inventing eukaryotic CRISPR was a patentably distinct invention from inventing CRISPR in vitro or in bacte- rial cells. This outcome had the benefit of certainty in identifying who owned the rights to eukaryotic CRISPR but suffered from the consequence that any third party wishing to bring CRISPR-modified eukaryotic organ- isms to market (or products made by such organisms) would likely need a license from both The Broad Institute and CVC, which could result in delays in commercial development.THE DEBATE ENSUES In June 2019, PTO declared another interference between these same parties, involving again who has the rights to eukaryotic applications of CRISPR (4). PTO did not change its mind or decide the first interference incorrectly. Rather, Broad and their collaborators had filed many patent applications directed to various aspects of eukaryotic CRISPR and had many of them granted as pat- ents. The CVC group had filed patent applications more broadly to CRISPR without regard to the cell targeted in the method; however, these applications were not specifically directed to eukaryotic embodiments of CRISPR. After not pre- vailing in the first interference, the CVC group filed applications directed more narrowly at eukaryotic CRISPR embod - iments, and PTO declared an interfer- ence between these applications and most of the same Broad patents and applica- tions involved in the first interference. Meanwhile, broader patents on CRISPR technology not limited to any particular organismal milieu have been granted to the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Vienna, which it would appear, should be licensed by third parties wanting to practice CRISPR. The current interference is in the early, so-called motions phase, where Broad has asserted its belief that the decision in the earlier interference should pre- clude the CVC party from pursuing their claims in this interference. CVC has responded by making its case that appli- cation of CRISPR to eukaryotic cells was within the ability of the ordinarily skilled artisan once CVC's first provi-sional application disclosing CRISPR was filed. It will be several months until PTO renders a decision on that ques- tion; if the decision goes against Broad only then will PTO consider evidence regarding who invented CRISPR for use in eukaryotic cells. A decision on that question will take at least another 10 months; a decision on motions, including a decision that CVC is barred by the first interference from pursuing claims in this interference, should be forthcom-ing before the end of 2020. Any such decision will likely be appealed, adding at least another six-month delay in resolving the question. And that's before PTO gets to the priority of invention question. In addition, another party, SigmaAldrich, also has a claim to priority for eukaryotic CRISPR, although these claims are bottled up in a procedural morass in PTO that has prevented the company from joining the fray, despite their argument that joining them to the existing interference would give PTO and the parties a chance to resolve the ownership issue more expeditiously. And there is at least another party that may be heard from; however, those claims have not been allowed and no interference has been declared. These circumstances leave the ownership status of eukaryotic CRISPR technology in limbo for at least the foreseeable future. This state of affairs raises clear impediments to commercial development, at least until\u2014and if\u2014the parties decide some way to cross-license CRISPR to third parties. UNCERTAINTY IN EUROPE The situation is also complicated in Europe, where, in 2019, the Opposition Division revoked one of Broad's European patents on important pro- cedural grounds (5). Specifically, the European Patent Convention requires that any application for patent establish at the filing date that the applicant properly owns the rights to the invention claimed in the application. In this case there was an inventor working at Rockefeller University who was named in certain of the priority documents relied upon in the European filing, but neither the inventor nor Rockefeller University was named in the application. Several third-party opponents took advantage of the oppo - sition period (nine months after grant) and opposed the European patent on these priority grounds. The Opposition Division agreed, and its revocation of Broad's European patent was upheld on appeal (6). In addition to losing this BioBusiness 38 BioPharm International M arch 2020 w ww.biopharminternational.compatent, Broad has eight additional pat- ents that are at risk for being revoked on grounds of having the same priority infir- mity. This leaves open the possibility that eukaryotic CRISPR might be practiced in Europe without the need for a license, but also without patent protection. While commercial development might continue under these circumstances, it might not flourish in view of developers' reasonable fear that any commercial product could be copied without liability or risk in the absence of patent protection. These are important considerations for the two greatest potential markets for eukaryotic CRISPR, agriculture and medicine. For agriculture, in addition to the development costs that companies wish to have defrayed, the volume of goods sold and the attendant profits to be made make patent exclusivity an import- ant consideration. Another important consideration is in animal husbandry and the development of improved strains of livestock, which is expected to be facil- itated by applying CRISPR to the task of stably generically modifying animals for human uses and consumption. These factors may be even more important in the pharmaceutical industry for similar reasons but different economic consider- ations; it can be expected that eukaryotic CRISPR might find its most profitable use involved with biologic drugs and the high costs of development and regula- tory approval. Other considerations are the possibility that CRISPR-engineered agricultural sources might avoid the most vocal opposition by those against genet- ically modified organisms, in view of the relatively less intrusive genetic changes CRISPR enables. In conclusion, while the challenges of developing CRISPR technology over the next decade will undoubtedly be predominantly scientific and tech-nological, economic realities mandate that ownership considerations will have a practical effect on what companies commercialize various aspects of the technology, where this commercializa-tion occurs, and the licensing costs and complexities that arise in the process.

While there is still not a 'one-for-all' approach, different analytical techniques are being evaluated to meet application needs with as much functionality as possible,\" Botonjic-Sehic says. THE VALUE OF AUTOMATION In addition to real-time data, automa- tion of both the bioprocess and the data collection and analysis, which can be leveraged by a computerized platform to provide real-time feedback control of the bioprocess, can provide an even deeper level of product quality, accord- ing to Botonjic-Sehic. Pall Biotech has implemented this approach through a framework capable of controlling the process equipment and analytical instruments, automating the data collection and analysis, and feeding the data into developed che- mometric models to enable continuous monitoring and control of bioprocesses. An integrated human-machine inter- face (HMI) enables the operator to monitor the process and intervene as needed, ensuring optimum process con- trol and product quality, according to Botonjic-Sehic. She notes that the auto- mated documentation of critical process parameters and CQAs also improves the efficiency of process maintenance, while the chemometric model of each unit operation improves productivity at each step. \"Our objective is to have fully automated and integrated control capa- bilities from end-to-end of the biopro- cess, capable of immediately detecting any deviation in either the process or the product, with an HMI giving the operator the tools needed to mitigate those deviations, saving time, reducing batch failures, and improving overall product quality and consistency at every scale,\" concludes Botonjic-Sehic. Advances in digital technology are also contributing to greater quality for data monitoring and control systems. For instance, cloud-based storage envi- ronments are making it easier to bring together data generated on process and analytical equipment, according to Seaver. \"This information can be linked to the purpose of the study in electronic laboratory notebooks to pro- vide the context. It has also made it possible to compare information across studies, multiple projects/molecules, and scales to better understand risk,\" he says. The popularity of coding lan - guages and technologies, such as the Industrial Internet of Things, has also led to amazing innovation in the areas of therapeutic development life- cycle data processing, adds Andrews. \"The advance of communication and encryption technologies mean data provenance and non-repudiation are more reliable,\" he explains.

What are some best practices for handling process or product changes? A: In December 2019, the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S) published a recommendation, 'How to Evaluate/Demonstrate the Effectiveness of a Pharmaceutical Quality System in relation to Risk-based Change Management' (1) and a Concept Note on this Recommendation docu - ment (2). This action highlights two critical aspects, namely the importance of change man - agement within the realm of quality and the necessity to apply a risk-based approach. Nothing stands still; therefore, change is inevitable. Though the PIC/S document covers all relevant steps in the change management process\u2014from change proposal, change assess - ment, change planning, and implementation, through to change review and effectiveness checks\u2014it does not detail categories of change. It merely states, 'Change categorizations are appropriate and based on the level of risk' (1). In practice, the following are three typical categories of change: P lanned changes: Someone wishes to make a change for whatever reason and applies to make this change. This change, if approved, will be implemented, its effectiveness veri-fied, and it becomes permanent. T emporary changes: Sometimes, some - one wishes to make changes for a defined period of time followed by a return to the previous state. This could be because there is the need for some building work, or because of staff shortages, or other reasons. Again, it is known that someone wants to make this change. If approved, it will be implemented for the desired period and then all goes back to as it was before. Some companies use the term 'planned devia - tions,' which is synonymous with E mergency changes: Rarely, an organiza - tion may have to implement emergency changes. Here, nobody knew that this change would be required, so there is no planning. Perhaps there is not even time for approval before the change is being imple - mented. Almost always, this type of change is triggered by an event that endangers environment, health, or safety. In short, an emergency change is triggered by a devia - tion. Perhaps a gas pipe develops a leak; the line must be immediately shut down and work perhaps continues with gas cylinders. As soon as possible, the change needs to be properly assessed and a decision must be made; this will either become a temporary change or a permanent change. To empha - sise, the only difference here is that you cannot plan for it. Looking at these scenarios, one finds that the starting point can differ (either a change request or a deviation). The end point may also differ; one Embracing Change Management No matter why change may be needed, it is important to comply with all the relevant regulatory requirements, says Siegfried Schmitt, PhD, vice-president, technical, Parexel Consulting.
