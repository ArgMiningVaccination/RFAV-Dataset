Goals of the project were to conserve medicinal plant knowledge, leading to ethnobotanical studies, and to conserve the plants 17 themselves, by creating a community ethnobotanical garden. A total of 169 medicinal species were collected in the ethnobotanical survey, which 18 provided unique knowledge on many rainforest species of the wet lowland forest of Southern Belize, not found in neighbouring Indigenous 19 cultures. Consensus on plant uses by the healers was high indicating a well conserved codified oral history. After horticultural experimentation 20 by the healers, the Indigenous botanical garden provided a habitat for and conservation of 102 medicinal species including many epiphytes that 21 were rescued from forested areas. Ethnopharmacological studies by the university partners showed a pharmacological basis for, and active 22 principles of, plants used for epilepsy and anxiety, for inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, for dermatological mycoses, and for type 2 23 diabetes complications. Overall, the project has provided a model for Indigenous empowerment and First Nation's science, as well as 24 establishing this traditional medicine as an important, unified healing practice, that can safely and effectively provide primary healthcare in its 25 cultural context. 26 27 R\u00e9sum\u00e9: Cette les qui a conduit 29 des \u00e9t\u00e9 basses du ne trouve pas dans les cultures indig\u00e8nes voisines.

Their living 46 descendants are distinct Maya Nations speaking different languages and dialects with some different cultural traditions. However, the Maya 47 today are united by a revival of common cultural traditions such as celebration of the Tzolk'in calendar, and by their close relationship with their 48 natural environment which has led to important ethnobotanical and agricultural traditions that are key to their common worldview (Ford and 49 Nigh, 2015). 50 The Q'eqchi' (also known as Kekchi in English) Maya are considered a more traditional Indigenous Maya culture living in highland areas of 51 Verapaz, Guatemala, in lowland Peten, Guatemala and Xna'ajeb' aj Ralch'o'och' (Toledo district, Belize) where they continue to speak the 52 Q'eqchi' language. In our working area in Belize, they live in more than 40 small villages in lowland primary and secondary rainforest and 53 practice milpa (shifting) agriculture to grow corn, beans, and squash cacao. In these 54 remote villages, there are no hospitals or medical clinics, and primary health care is often provided by male traditional healers, or female 55 midwives who have been trained by elders and represent a living library of Maya medicine. The semievergreen flora of this region has high Page 4 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft56 rainfall and a short dry season. It is highly diverse and was designated a hotspot for priority biodiversity conservation by Meyers et al (1999). 57 Davis (2001) has argued that with the loss of languages and culture, the ethnosphere is an even greater priority for conservation than 58 biodiversity. Language provides an intimate knowledge of the local environment and biodiversity in particular (Hua et al, 2019). 59 In addition to work reviewed here, there are several studies on the medical ethnobotany of the Q'eqchi' Maya. In highland Guatemala Vargas 60 and Andrade-Cetto (2018) studied the non-specialist medical ethnobotany of the population in three Maya villages and Thiel and Quinlan (2020) 61 reported on medicinal fruit trees. Plants used in women's health in Guatemala have been studied by Michel et al(2007 and 2016). Berger 62 Gonzalez et al(2016a, 2016b) have explored transdisciplinary Q'eqchi'-Western relationships in health, particularly concepts of cancer in 63 Guatemala. Geck et al (2020) have developed a herbal medicine data base of 2188 plant taxa used in Mesoamerica including some Q'eqchi' 64 phytotherapies with the view to creating a unified regional traditional medicine. 65 In Belize, Waldram (2020) has documented the cultural aspects of traditional healing and patient views on traditional healing. Zarger (2002) 66 studied the transmission of traditional botanical knowledge to children. De Gezelle (2014) studied Q'eqchi' Maya reproductive ethnomedicine. 67 Many Q'eqchi' medicinal plants and uses are described in the informative text, \"Messages from the Gods\" (Balick and Arvigo, 2018) on the useful 68 plants of Belize.This review provides a summary of the results of our two decades collaboration with specialist traditional healers in southern 69 Belize, including documentation of their ethnobotanical knowledge and efforts at conservation and scientific evaluation of medicinal plants. 70 History, Framework and ApproachPage 5 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft71 This partnership began in 1999 with the revival of Indigenous cultures at the start of the millennium, when the Belize Indigenous Training 72 Institute requested assistance from the Inuit of Nunangat, who are known for their scientific expertise in natural resource relationships, to 73 provide assistance for community stewardship of natural resources in Southern Belize. This request included support for recognition and 74 strengthening of the Kekchi Maya Healer's Association, a professional association of male traditional healers from different villages in the Toledo 75 District. The Inuit recruited our lab at the University of Ottawa and later Cleveland State University based on our previous ethnobotanical and 76 ancient Maya land use studies in Belize (Arnason et al (1980), Lambert and Arnason (1982), Healey et al, (1983), Lambert et al (1984) and 77 Dunham et al (2009)). The goals of the Kekchi Maya Healer's Association were developed in an Indigenous-led three day workshop funded by the 78 International Development Research Centre, which brought together the healers and stakeholders from the communities, representatives of 79 local Maya council, government, public health, Maya high school, representative of the Inuit, representatives of the two universities and experts 80 in community forestry and biodiversity. Major goals defined by the healers with input from the workshop participants were to conserve 81 medicinal plant knowledge, leading to ethnobotanical studies, and to conserve the plants themselves, by creating an ethnobotanical garden, the 82 Itzamma Garden, under their control. The garden would also serve to provide increasingly hard to find plants for local healing in the 83 communities and education of Maya students at the local schools. As well, a third goal was to learn more about the safety and efficacy of plant 84 medicines by scientific study. To further study safety and efficacy beyond the Maya experience, the Universities were asked to undertake 85 scientific studies on plant medicines in laboratory research and communicate with Ministry of Health, Belize. With the University participants 86 prior knowledge of classic Maya land use and ethnobotany, they hypothesized that Q'eqchi' traditional medicine has ancient roots, and has a 87 well developed pharmacopeia, based on their expert knowledge of the properties of the forest flora of Southern Belize.Page 6 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft88 Issues of access and benefit sharing were agreed on, well before the Nagoya protocol, with input from Indigenous people in Canada. In research 89 agreements with the Universities, the Kekchi Healers Association and parent organization, Belize Indigenous Training Institute, hold majority 90 stake in intellectual property. They made the decision that pharmaceutical development and patenting was not a primary interest of theirs, but 91 publication was desirable to claim their prior knowledge and provide evidence of the value of their healing tradition for selected subject areas 92 described here. Detailed specific ethnobotanical records made during field trips with the healers by University researchers were returned to the 93 healers in the form of handbooks for their use and for use at local Maya schools but not released for international publication, except for specific 94 ethnopharmacology research. Research was conducted in accordance with Belize's conservation-oriented biodiversity strategy, and collection 95 permits were obtained from the forestry department, Belize. As well, necessary ethical approvals from the research ethics boards of both 96 Universities and following Canada tricouncil guidelines for vulnerable populations, based on the principles of prior informed consent. Permission 97 to take photographs for research purposes was granted by the healers. The project held regular meetings to discuss progress, beginning with the 98 Tzolk'in ceremony. While the team supports the best intentions of the Nagoya protocol, we noted that it has deficiencies recorded by First 99 Nations in Canada, particularly in light of poor consultation with Indigenous peoples and other discriminatory actions by the government of 100 Canada, the co-chair for the draft treaty (Grand Council of the Crees (Eeyou Istchee) et al, 2012). 101 1. The ethnobotany 102 Botanical aspects 103 A primary medicinal ethnobotany using quantitative methods was prepared by the PhD student Virginie Amiguet, in collaboration with nine 104 Q'eqchi Maya healers from 5 villages (Amiguet et al, 2005). Remarkably 169 species were collected, belonging to 67 different families. Families Page 7 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft105 that had the highest number of species used were the Rubiaceae (16) Piperaceae (14) Asteraceae (12), Melastomataceae (10), Araceae Fabaceae (6) Adiantaceae (5) Verbenaceae (5) and Apocynaceae (4) while the Poaceae, the Cyperaceae, and the Orchidaceae were infrequently 107 used. A selection of high consensus species is shown (Table 1). Habitats of the plants collected showed that 31% were from primary forest, 50% 108 were from secondary forest, and only 19% were from open areas (fields, riverbanks, kitchen gardens etc.). The healers indicated that forest 109 species, especially from pristine undisturbed forest areas were the most potent medicines (Figure 1A and B). Lifeforms included not only herbs, 110 trees and shrubs, but a large number of epiphytes, including many ferns, lianas and small vines . In a later survey by Otarola et al (2009), an 111 additional 40 plant species were recorded. 112 The pharmacopeia of the Q'eqchi' healers of Belize is different from other neighbouring cultures. The flora used in Belize is very different from 113 the cloud forest flora used by the highland Q'eqchi in Alta Verapaz Guatemala (Vargas and Andrade-Cetto, 2018). Choco et al (2018) made 114 surveys in Belize to compare ethnobotanical use of the Q'eqchi' and Yucatec Maya communities in Belize. Their survey showed very different 115 species use despite close geographic location of the two communities. We also compared the 78 species reported in our Yucatec ethnobotany 116 (Arnason et al, 1981) with the 169 species in the Q'eqchi' healers' ethnobotany. Surprisingly only 8 species were similar and many of the uses 117 reported were different. A comparison with medicinal plants reported in the Caribbean Herbal Pharmacopeia (CHP), the largest regional 118 medicinal pharmacopeia maintained by the TRAMIL network showed that few species reported here were found in the CHP. This is despite the 119 fact that the majority of the CHP plants are common in Belize, especially in open areas and kitchen gardens. A conclusion from these 120 comparisons is that the Q'eqchi' healers medicinal ethnobotany is a rainforest ethnobotany with important knowledge of rare and less well 121 studied medicinal plants of the high rainfall forests in southern Belize.Page 8 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft122 Uses 123 The most frequently used plants in the Q'eqchi' pharmacopoeia are practical treatments for the ailments that are common, including some 124 conditions specific to tropical regions. The largest treatment categories with number of species were for infections (145 species), digestive 125 system (88), nervous system (57), muscular system (40), skin (24) and poisons (23). These treatment categories are illustrated in examples of 126 high consensus specific treatments used by all the healers (Table 1). Treatment of specific common conditions such as fever, headache and 127 cough are straightforward. Traditional healers are held in high regard for their treatments of snakebite by all ethnic groups in Belize and the 128 ethnobotany has many examples of treatments for this condition. Treatments for skin infections and wounds are frequent, because of the humid 129 tropical environment. Tropical diseases such as malaria, which is endemic and yellow fever, which is historically important, are treated. Other 130 common treatment categories are arthritis/rheumatism, ulcers and epilepsy. The Q'eqchi' healers also employ medicinal plants for the 131 treatment of culture bound syndromes. Among conditions that are not recognized in allopathic medicine are \"susto\" (fright) and \"mal viento\". 132 Treatment methods for conditions are variable but they usually involve interventions with prayers, often at a healing ceremony led by a spiritual 133 leader (Figure 1C) with family and community present in more serious cases, as well as physical treatment with medicinal plants. Healing 134 ceremonies usually involve the burning of copal incense, blessing of the four compass points, a traditional Tzolk'in calendar ceremony and 135 prayers for the sick person followed by medicinal plant treatments after the ceremony. Plant parts are usually prepared as hot or cold 136 infusions/decoctions and may be applied externally or consumed according to the treatment. 137 Healer consensusPage 9 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft138 Healers were interviewed separately to determine the true consensus in their recall of botanical knowledge. Using Trotter and Logan's informant 139 consensus factor (Fic), agreement between healers on which plants were used for different categories of uses were evaluated. Fic values were 140 greater than 0.5 on 15 of 17 categories suggesting agreement was greater than 50%. For example, agreement on plants used for infections, 141 digestive system, respiratory system was around Fic= 0.7. This high level of consensus indicates a well-developed cultural knowledge and reflects 142 the training that healers undertake when apprenticing for six months to a year with a recognized healer. Plant knowledge is generally public and 143 shared for the public health of all. Consensus among other practitioners of Indigenous Mesoamerican traditional medicines is often high. For 144 example, Heinrich et al (1998) reported gastrointestinal system disorders and dermatological conditions had Fic values of 0.71 and 0.52, 145 respectively, indicating a strong degree of consensus for treatments within these usage categories by Yucatec healers in Mexico. We can 146 contrast this with findings in East Timor where consensus evaluated by similar methods was low and knowledge held by healers considered 147 secret (Collins et al, 2006). High consensus suggests an observationally validated pharmacopeia that may have developed over long periods of 148 time and a scholarly practice of traditional healing, which is a source of professional pride and public respect for the healers. 149 2. The Itzamma Garden and Conservation Efforts 150 The healers were concerned about the loss of forest area available for medicinal plant collection in the Toledo district as well as the time 151 required to collect plants in distant forested areas. In particular most accessible primary forest near roads in the Toledo district have been felled 152 for slash and burn agriculture. A field survey (Pesek et al, 2006) in collaboration with several healers in the remote and rugged Maya mountains 153 located several sites where rare, disappearing and culturally significant medicinal plants were still abundant. As the healers rely so extensively on 154 species that are found in primary and rich secondary forests, these species must be protected in situ and ex situ. Pesek et al, (2010) Page 10 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft155 demonstrated that a culturally relevant conservation strategy ought to be applied for effectiveness. The healers have their own strategy for 156 selecting areas with high concentrations of potent medicinal plants. Specifically, they reference four traditional environmental categories host to 157 medicinal plants: cool areas under high forest with much humus, warm areas under low forest, hot and warm areas on rocks and cliffs, and 158 riversides. These healer ecosystem constructs/environmental zones when compared with scientific ecosystems, were the most accurate 159 environmental descriptors as they improve prediction of high or low abundance of relevant medicinal species in a specific region to a greater 160 degree (Pesek et al, 2010). 161 This approach led to the development of a predictive model of medicinal plant distribution which applies Traditional knowledge and illustrates 162 combining science and traditions to identify regions where potent medicinal species are located to create in situ and ex situ conservation 163 strategies that are culturally relevant (Pesek et al, 2009). Belize has a good record in conservation efforts and these areas are protected, which is 164 promising for the long-term survival of these species as well as the fostering sustainable plant resources for traditional healing. 165 However, closer to the villages in the Toledo District, easily accessible populations of forest medicinal plants are being extirpated. To conserve 166 species closer to the Maya villages, and to have medicinal plants readily available for therapy, the healers established an Indigenous 167 ethnobotanical garden on a 50 acre (20 ha) site near Indian Creek village. Medicinal plants from remnant forests near the villages were 168 transplanted to the garden to avoid future wild harvesting (Figure 2). The garden was named the Itzamma Garden, meaning the place of the God 169 of Wisdom, Itzamna. The site is in secondary forest, where large trees were felled during a 2001 hurricane. The healers created a 1 ha garden by 170 clearing out undergrowth for planting medicinal plants in rows in the understory. As well, as an area was cleared for cultivated full sun plants 171 (Figure 1D). Initially when the wild plants were moved to the garden, mortality was high, and survival of transplanted species was especially Page 11 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft172 difficult during the dry season and with epiphytes. Inherent differences between the garden (drier, and different soil condition) compared to 173 forest collection sites were partly responsible for the difficulties encountered by the healers (Bourbonnais- Spear et al, 2006). Later the healers 174 became more skillful at keeping the plants hydrated during and after transplantation by irrigation and having them survive in adaptive 175 microhabitats (Audet et al, 2013). One innovative habitat was the use of large trees downed in the hurricane as a nurse log habitat where the 176 healers were able to cultivate many species of epiphytes, including Begonias, Peperomias, and medicinal ferns (Figure 2). The full sun site was 177 partly planted with ornamentals, spices and sun loving shrubs, as well as more commonly used medicinal species with commercial potential such 178 as lemon grass (Figure 2) and ginger. The remaining 19 ha forest area was enhanced with economically important trees such as Ceiba, 179 mahogany, Spanish cedar and fruit trees planted in transect lines at large intervals. A survey by Otarola et al (2010) found that 62 medicinal 180 plants not previously reported were growing in the garden as well, which were new additions to the ethnobotany. 181 The Indigenous garden has not only been very successful in support of traditional healers and biodiversity conservation, but also provided a 182 community space for elders to meet, a place for healing ceremonies with patients, space for teaching traditional knowledge to local Maya 183 students, and an area for Indigenous scientific agronomy. The Belize Indigenous Training Institute programmed some micro business activities at 184 the garden, including ecotourism visits and sale of medicinal plants and preparations (in particular ginger root, lemon grass, allspice leaf, cats 185 claw vine, and guava leaf). An analysis by Audet et al (2013) found that the Itzamma Garden was a model for Indigenous empowerment and 186 community involvement. Challenges arise from the advanced age of the healers and funds for sustainability. 187 3. Ethnopharmacological StudiesPage 12 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft188 We completed some of the first steps in evaluating the plant medicines for efficacy and safety beyond many centuries of traditional use, with 189 pharmacological studies and identification of active principles by bioassay guided isolation (Figure 3). In some cases, we were able to assess 190 them in non invasive animal models. Identification of active principles is essential to assessing whether compounds belong to hazardous 191 categories such as pyrrolizidine alkaloids or aristolochic acids. Further evaluation of plants in long-term feeding trial with animals and clinical 192 assessment could be considered. 193 Healing and mental health 194 It was apparent to the ethnobotany team that despite the very wide spectrum of treatments, mental health was a priority first step for the 195 healers. When asked why they chose to apprentice and become healers, many of the healers mentioned that it was to help people, perhaps 196 starting with a particular family member who was ill. When treating a patient for the first time, the healers assure them that they are available 197 to help them and that they will not become gravely ill or die. 198 The specific ethnobotanical treatments for mental health conditions were numerous, including 82 species of which 41 species were for epilepsy, 199 8 species for the culture bound syndrome \"susto\" and 4 for depression (Bourbonnais-Spear et al, 2005, Awad et al, 2009). Epilepsy is considered 200 \"loss of the spirit\" from the body and a serious condition that needs intervention. \"Susto\" is well known in many forms in Central America but 201 for these Maya healers, it represents chronic illness (general malaise, stomachache, anxiety, withdrawal, other symptoms) resulting from a 202 shock. The relative frequency of use by all the healers for epilepsy (% RF epilepsy ) and for susto (% RF susto) was calculated for each plant.Page 13 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft203 An important pharmacological target for some antiepileptic drugs is Gamma Amino Butyric Acid transaminase (GABA-T), an enzyme that 204 degrades GABA, a neurotransmitter which has an inhibitory or calming effect. When tested for inhibition of GABA-T compared to an epileptic 205 drug control, vigabatrin, many of the plant extracts had significant activity. Correlation analysis compared the biological activities of plant 206 extracts and their % RF epilepsy values. For all epilepsy plants tested (3x at 1mg/mL) for GABA-T inhibition, the correlation was significant not 207 high (p=0.034, F=4.882, r2 =0.132, r=0.364, n=34). However, the result was greatly improved when only 8 species of Piperaceae were included 208 (p<0.02; F=10.13, r2 =0.628, r=0.792, n=8). This result suggests that there is a strong pharmacological basis for the choice of active Piperaceae by 209 the healers and perhaps some other species in epilepsy. One of the most widely used plants was Cux sawi (Q'eqchi'), Piper tuerckheimii C. DC. Ex 210 Donn. which had a IC 50 of 2.8 \u00b5g/mL for GABA-T inhibition. Bioassay guided isolation led to the identification of three novel epileptic compounds 211 from the active fraction, including a furanoside and two phenyl propanoid derivatives (Figure 3) (Picard 2011). 212 We hypothesized that susto would be translated pharmacologically into the science term generalized anxiety syndrome and that plants used in 213 these treatments were anxiolytic. This hypothesis was tested using a classical anxiety pharmacological assay, involving the GABA A-BZD receptor 214 and later study in an animal model. Binding was assessed using a microplate assay, in which GABA A-BZD agonist activity was measured by the 215 ability of plant extracts to displace labelled flunitrazepam from tissue preparations (donated). When susto plant extracts were tested in this 216 assay (Awad et al,2009), the GABA A-BZD activity correlated significantly with the frequency of use of the plant by all the healers (% RF susto), 217 (p=0.003, F=12.68, r2 =0.475, r=0.689, n=16). These suggested that the healers' selection of treatments for susto has, in part, a 218 pharmacological basis in agonist activity at this classic anxiolytic target.Page 14 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft219 One of the plants used by most of the healers and preferred by all healers interviewed as treatment for susto (Adiantum tetraphyllum Humb. cuan in Q'eqchi') reduced anxiety and fear, when tested in rat behavioral models (Bourbonnais-Spear et al, 2006). 221 Another important susto plant, Piper amalago L. (Tzi'ritok in Q'eqchi') was further tested in rat behavioural models for anxiety, including the 222 elevated plus maze. In this latter test, animals can chose to stay in closed areas or move onto open elevated arms, a risky but potentially 223 rewarding behaviour. Treatment with valium significantly increases time animals spend in the open arm, as did the P. amalago extract with a 224 strong dose response. This plant clearly has anxiolytic activity in other tests (social interaction and fear potentiated startle) as well, and bioassay 225 guided isolation of its active principles led to the identification of a furofuran lignan (Figure 3) and several piperamides as the main active 226 principles (Mullaly et al, 2016). In other cultures, Piper spp. L. are widely used in foods and medicines and generally regarded as safe in moderate 227 doses. 228 An important aspect of Q'eqchi' traditional medicine, especially for mental health, is the healing ceremony, in which a spiritual leader uses 229 traditional ceremony and prayers to aid the healing process. The ceremony begins with scattering of Copal (Protium copal (Schltdl &Cham.) 230 Engl.) resin into a sacred fire, which creates a smoky incense surrounding the participants. The use of Copal (Copal Pom in Q'eqchi') has ancient 231 roots in the Maya lands, with many written references to its use in the classic period. For the Q'eqchi', Copal Pom is the medium used to 232 enhance both celestial and terrestrial life with the smoke of communication (utz'u'uj, the flower or Spiritual Scent). 233 When used in ceremonies, Copal creates a sacred atmosphere for participants and the effect of copal incense on mood is often said to be rapid 234 and intense. Clearly, this mood is created, in large part, by the reverence the Maya have for their traditional ceremonies. 235Page 15 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft236 In our studies, (Merali et al, 2018), we examined whether Copal incense had an added pharmacological effect on neurochemical processes 237 affecting mood, through the rapid absorption of inhaled volatile resins. The analysis of the resin revealed presence of triterpenoid amyrins, 238 which are known anxiolytics. Although exposure of rodents to copal incense did not have an effect in the elevated plus maze, the incense 239 significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior in social interaction tests. Anxiolytic and cannabinoid antagonists, flumazenil and AM251, 240 respectively, blocked the anxiolytic activity of copal revealing the involvement of GABAergic and endocannabinoid systems. 241 242 Studies by Waldram (2020) have revealed the importance of cultural and ceremonial aspects of healing, and our studies further demonstrate 243 that healers are skilled practitioners using pharmacologically active plants and ceremony as two components of their holistic medicine. 244 245 Immunomodulation, a major activity of Q'eqchi' medicinal plants 246 Immunomodulation underlies many conditions treated by healers. These included categories such as arthritis, insect bites, hay fever, allergies 247 etc. In total 107 plant species were identified belonging to 49 families used by Q'eqchi' Maya healers in the treatment of symptoms classified 248 into 14 usage categories related to inflammation (Walshe-Roussel et al 2019). The families with the largest number of medicinal species were 249 Piperaceae, Araceae, Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Adiantaceae and each had five or more medicinal species. Healer consensus for use of plant 250 species was high. Fifty six species (52%) were used by all healers, and informant consensus factor (Fic) values for each Cook category of use were 251 greater than 0.4.(i.e 40% consensus). These results suggested a good agreement on plant use, consistent with a well-defined traditional Page 16 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft252 pharmacopeia. Healers classify plants and illnesses they treat into traditional humoral categories of hot and cold and identified two culture 253 bound syndromes associated with swelling. 254 Ethnopharmacological investigations of the anti-inflammatory activity of 52 of the plants was made with assessment of Tumor Necrosis Factor 255 alpha (TNF-) production in a THP-1 cells stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Twenty-one species (40%) demonstrated significant TNF- 256 inhibition when assayed at 100 \u00b5g/mL. Eight species had greater than 50% of the activity of the parthenolide positive control (10 \u00b5g/mL). 257 Linear regressions found a significant relationship between the anti- TNF- activity and total healer frequency of use (F use) for 3 usage categories, 258 which indicated that ethnobotanical parameters can in part predict the activity of traditionally used species. Clearly there is an underlying 259 pharmacological basis for plant use in inflammatory conditions. 260 261 One plant that is widely used and highly regarded with high consensus by the healers is Neurolaena lobata (L.) Cass for treatment of insect bites, 262 skin irritation and some internal digestive conditions (Walshe-Roussel et al, 2013). Five sesquiterpene lactones were isolated from the leaves of 263 N. lobata, all of which demonstrated inhibition of the inflammatory cytokine TNF-, greater than that of parthenolide (Fifty percent inhibition 264 value, IC 50 = 4.79 \u00b5M), with IC 50 values ranging from 0.17-2.32 \u00b5M. Lobatin B was the most active isolate tested (Figure 3). The active principles 265 have a similar mode of action to those in feverfew, undergoing Michael addition to proteins. Because of the presence of sesquiterpene lactone 266 in the extract, some caution is needed in use, since these compounds can cause hepatotoxicity through protein alkylation. However, feverfew 267 containing the sesquiterpene lactone parthenolide is approved in Canada for digestive aid and headache relief claims: 268Page 17 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or Antifungal, bacterial biofilm and quorums sensing of Q'eqchi' plants 270 271 Many specific uses by Q'eqchi healers, for example for athlete's foot, sores, and skin conditions suggested an underlying antimicrobial activity in 272 the plants. Since the antibacterial activity of many plant species is well established, we chose to assess antifungal activity and inhibition of 273 bacterial biofilms and quorum sensing (QS) activities as novel and more interesting types of antimicrobial activities. Ta (2015) evaluated sixty one 274 Q'eqchi' Maya medicinal plant species for these three antimicrobial activities. When use categories were considered, dermatological use was the 275 category with the highest percentage of active species (53%); infections (48%) and muscle use were the next highest with 45%, followed by pain, 276 poisons, and digestive use with 44%, and 41 and 40%, respectively. Of the species, four showed more QS inhibition than the positive control, 277 Dulcia pulchra, and seven had comparable biofilm inhibitory activities that of allicin. The best antifungal activity was found in Cestrum 278 schlechtendahlii G. Don (Ik che in Q'eqchi'), used for athlete's foot. Two spirostanol saponins were isolated by bioassay guided isolation. The 279 major saponin (Figure 3) showed growth inhibition against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium graminearum, with MICs of 16.5 M and 132 280 M, respectively. Further analyses of this compound using chemical genomics suggested that its antifungal mechanism of action is pleotropic. 281 Taken together, these findings showed that neotropical plants and traditional Q'eqchi' Maya medicines used in antimicrobial applications 282 contain phytochemicals that interfere with bacterial biofilm formation and quorum sensing as well as fungal growth. 283 284 Type 2 Diabetes Pharmacology Page 18 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft285 Type 2 diabetes (T2D), is a disease of increasing incidence worldwide including Belize. Although traditional healers cannot perform clinical tests 286 for diabetes diagnosis, they recognize and treat many symptoms of diabetes, such as increased thirst, urination, persistent sores, and 287 neuropathy. They also treat diabetes once diagnosed at a hospital or clinic. Ethnobotanical evaluation of plants used in T2D symptoms is 288 complex but made more straightforward by the development of a quantitative ethnobotany index by the Cuerrier lab (Leduc et al, 2006) called 289 the syndromic importance value (SIV). Plants are ranked for importance in traditional treatments of diabetes, based on a sum for all symptoms 290 of a combination of frequency of use of a species adjusted by physician-rated importance as an indicator of diabetes. The index was later 291 updated (Ferrier et al, 2014) for the Q'eqchi' study. This investigation revealed a large number of species used in treatment of diabetic 292 symptoms. The top ranked plants were tested in an antidiabetic glycation assay, which measured the potential of plant extracts to inhibit protein 293 glycation leading to advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) which are formed in a high blood sugar environment. For example, glycated 294 hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1C) is often used as a biomarker for monitoring prolonged hyperglycemia in diabetic patients. Although regulation of 295 blood glucose is the primary goal of treatment, inhibition of glycation is a complementary treatment which may reduce impact of diabetic 296 symptoms such as neuropathy, leg sores, vison problems associated with the formation of AGEs. 297 Q'eqchi' antidiabetic plants with high SIV were tested in the AGE inhibition assay (Ferrier et al, 2018) and all extracts showed AGE inhibition. A 298 linear regression showed a signicant relationship between activity and SIV.The most active species was Tynanthus guatemalensis Donn Sm. a tropical liana, known as Chibayal in Q'eqchi' which is widely used in the forest to make a pleasant-smelling aromatic tea. 300 Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of verbascoside (Figure 3), as a major component and anti AGE active principle of the T. Page 19 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft301 guatemalensis which had an IC 50 =5.1\u00b5g/mL, comparable to the positive control quercetin. The aroma of the drink, on the other hand, was 302 identified as eugenol, an essential oil compound. 303 By serendipity, we noticed that Chibayal vine has a prominent yellow cross pattern in the wood of perpendicularly cut vines (Figure 2E). This 304 pattern matched the shape of a classic period (250-900 CE) glyph used to describe a \"precious, yellow\" plant flavouring component in cacao 305 drinks, the identity of which was tentatively assigned by archeologists as allspice. Allspice and Chibayal share the same aroma component, 306 eugenol, but allspice does not have the cross shaped wood pattern. It therefore appears likely that the glyph represents Chibayal rather than 307 allspice (Ferrier et al, 2020). In the current Q'eqchi' celebration, Chibayal is associated with the eighth day of their Tzolk'in calendar, which is 308 called the \"nawal\" (energy) of \"q'anil\" (ripe, full yellow). The addition of chibayal to cacao drinks provided both aroma and health benefits to the 309 classic period Maya. The use of the plant today suggests the continuity of important pharmacological plants. 310 Conclusion 311 Q'eqchi' Maya medicine as practiced by the traditional healers in Southern Belize appears to be a well developed ethnobotanical tradition with a 312 high degree of consensus among healers and a wealth of newly recorded knowledge about medicinally useful species in the highly diverse 313 rainforests of the Toledo District. The healers provide an important service as primary health care providers to their villages, where other 314 avenues of health care are few or absent. Innovative thinking and collaboration with outside Indigenous partners has allowed the healers to 315 develop self-governance of their profession, and establishment of an Indigenous botanical garden which provides conservation and propagation 316 of medicinal plants, a centre for traditional healing ceremonies, student training and micro economic activities. The activities put in place by the Page 20 of 35 \u00a9 The Author(s) or their Institution(s)BotanyDraft317 Q'eqchi' healers provide a model for other Indigenous groups elsewhere seeking to better use, preserve and gain recognition for their traditional 318 botanical knowledge. 319 Many of the species used are previously unstudied taxa of the wet lowland forest of southern Belize and our ethnopharmacological 320 investigations suggest a pharmacological basis, in part, for treatment of some mental health conditions, inflammation, infections, and type 2 321 diabetes. The active principles and pharmacology of selected species have been identified which is an important step in defining safe, evidence 322 based phytotherapies. The traditional knowledge the Q'eqchi' healers of Xna'ajeb' aj Ralch'o'och' and the scientific study of their plant medicines 323 provide missing information for the growing Mesoamerican database on traditional medicine which has more complete information from 324 Mexico and Guatemala (Geck et al, 2020). All the Maya ethnobotanical traditions contribute to a larger Mesoamerican traditional medicine that 325 we believe should receive the same recognition and study as Traditional Chinese Medicine or Ayurveda. 326 At least two plants studied (Copal Pom and Chibayal) can be connected back to their use in the classic period (250-900CE). The continuous use 327 of the Maya calendars is also a cultural connection to the classic Maya period. Maya culture and medicine was supressed during the colonial era, 328 marked in the Maya long count calendar as baktun 12, a period of 394 year. At the solstice, Dec 21st, 2012, the Q'eqchi' Maya healers of 329 Xna'ajeb' aj Ralch'o'och' celebrated the arrival of baktun 13 at the Uxbenka ceremonial site. When asked what the significance of this new era 330 was, they responded: \"an opportunity to leave the past behind and make the world whatever we wish it to be\". 331 Acknowledgement: We are especially grateful for the collaboration and knowledge of the Q'eqchi' healers.
