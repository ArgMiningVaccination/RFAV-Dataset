The Art Program at Ochsner Medical Center - New Orleans was founded in 1995 as part of the Healing Healthcare Environment initiative. We seek to use non-traditional therapies to promote a new sense of spiritual wellness among patients, visitors, and staff. Initially, the Program established one Art Walk in the main concourse of the facility. This offers an extended gallery wall for artists to show their work on a temporary basis. Later, a second Art Walk was added in an adjacent hallway. Works shown in both areas are available for purchase, though the Medical Center is not involve itself in any sale transactions, which are strictly between the artist and the potential buyer. The art walks allow local artists to share their talent by contributing to the creation of a healing environment for patients, visitors, and staff. Recently, the Program accepted a large glass wall case which accommodates three-dimensional objects, as well as smaller scale paintings and graphic works. Exhibits here are prepared by the Art Program volunteers or local organizations and generally showcase various aspects of world art and culture. Titles of past exhibits include: \"Arts and Crafts of Cuba\", \"Pysanky\", \"Chinese New Fowl Carvers of Louisiana\". The exhibits exemplify Ochsner's community outreach and its commitment to diversity and inclusiveness. Well before the official establishment of the Art Program, Ochsner Medical Center - New Orleans began to acquire a permanent collection of art. It has grown throughout the years and is now administered by the Art Program. Works are acquired chiefly through donation and are shown in selected areas ranging from lobbies and waiting rooms to offices, dining areas, and conference rooms. There are several collections of artwork featured throughout the hospital. For more information about the Art Program, please contact Guest & Volunteer Services at 504-842-5085.
