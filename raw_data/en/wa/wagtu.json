From giving a safe environment, good education and a healthy livelihood, you have a 360\u00b0 view of protecting your little one. However, not all threats to your child's safety are visible. Vaccines remain the safest and the most cost-effective protection against various life-threatening diseases. It is vital that the parents are aware of additional immunization against life-threatening diseases that are not currently covered by the government. Apart from the 11 vaccines given by the government, WHO and IAP recommend additional 5 vaccinations to complete the immunization shield around the child.
