A recent study performed with rodents demonstrated that messenger RNA can be adapted to deliver genetic material to the blood stem cells in bone marrow, potentially allowing scientists to correct mutations behind diseases like beta thalassaemia. The next step is to confirm that this procedure can be performed safely on humans. But according to one scientist involved in the research, \"This is the future of medicine. The sky is the limit.\" [During the COVID pandemic, Republicans in Ohio and Florida had a higher mortality rate than Democrats](https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2023/08/14/during-the-covid-pandemic-republicans-in-ohio-and-florida-had-a-higher-mortality-rate-than-democrats/) A recent headline-grabbing studied found that more Republicans than Democrats in Ohio and Florida died from COVID after vaccines were authorized for all adults. The researchers claimed based on their results that voter registration may be a risk factor for vaccine hesitancy and thus disease risk. Left out of the many news stories, however, were the study's serious limitations\u2014which render its results, at the very best, speculative. Like many news outlets, the Washington Post has taken up the task of combating scientific \"misinformation.\" Oddly, the Post continues to spread its fare share dubious research and sham medical treatments, including acupuncture. Why would the news media chastise the public for believing mis and disinformation while promoting obvious examples of pseudoscience?
