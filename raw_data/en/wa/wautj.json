This article covers Australian vaccines and vaccination recommendations for children and teenagers with healthy immune systems, weak immune systems, medical conditions, disability and other additional needs. If you're not sure about your child's vaccination needs, speak with your GP, your child's specialist or a vaccination provider - for example, if your child has a weak immune system, a medical condition or other additional needs. In the vaccination information below, we talk about 'original' vaccines and 'bivalent' vaccines. Original vaccines are based on the original strain of COVID-19. Bivalent vaccines are based on the original and newer strains. Both original and bivalent vaccines protect against severe COVID disease. 6 months-4 years COVID-19 vaccination is currently recommended for children aged 6 months up to 5 years only if children have special medical or other needs, including very weak immune systems, disability, or complex and/or multiple health conditions. It's recommended that children aged 6 months-4 years with special medical or other needs have 3 doses of the Pfizer original vaccine, with each dose given 8 weeks apart. Booster doses aren't currently recommended for children aged 6 months-4 years. 5-11 years Primary course It's recommended that most children aged 5-11 years have 2 doses of the Pfizer original vaccine, 3-8 weeks apart. Booster dose A booster dose isn't currently recommended for most children aged 5-11 years. But children aged 5-11 years with disability or complex and/or multiple health conditions can have a single booster dose of the Pfizer original vaccine. You can consider a booster dose for these children if their last dose or confirmed COVID-19 infection was 6 months ago or longer. It's best to get a booster dose before winter, but it's never too late. 5-11 years: very weak immune systems Primary course It's recommended that these children have 3 doses of the Pfizer original vaccine, with the first and second doses 3-8 weeks apart and the third dose 2 months later. Booster dose These children can have a single booster dose of the Pfizer original vaccine. You can consider a booster dose for these children if their last dose or confirmed COVID-19 infection was 6 months ago or longer. It's best to get a booster dose before winter, but it's never too late. 12-17 years Primary course It's recommended that children aged 12-17 years have one of the following: - Pfizer bivalent - 2 doses, 3-8 weeks apart - Moderna bivalent - 2 doses, 3-8 weeks apart. Bivalent vaccines are preferred to original vaccines for this age group. But if your child can't have a bivalent vaccine, they can have an original vaccine or Novavax instead. Booster dose A booster dose isn't currently recommended for most children aged 12-17 years. But children aged 12-17 years with disability or complex and/or multiple health conditions can have a single booster dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna bivalent vaccines. Bivalent vaccines are preferred to original vaccines as boosters for this age group. But if your child can't have a bivalent vaccine, they can have an original vaccine or Novavax instead. You can consider a booster dose for these children if their last dose or confirmed COVID-19 infection was 6 months ago or longer. It's best to get a booster dose before winter, but it's never too late. 12-17 years: very weak immune systems Primary course It's recommended that these children have one of the following: - Pfizer bivalent - 3 doses, with the first and second doses 3-8 weeks apart and the third dose 2 months later - Moderna bivalent - 3 doses, with the first and second doses 3-8 weeks apart and the third dose 2 months later. Bivalent vaccines are preferred to original vaccines for these children. But if your child can't have a bivalent vaccine, they can have an original vaccine or Novavax instead. Booster dose These children can have a single booster dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna bivalent vaccines. Bivalent vaccines are preferred to original vaccines as boosters for these children. But if your child can't have a bivalent vaccine, they can have an original vaccine or Novavax instead. You can consider a booster dose for these children if their last dose or confirmed COVID-19 infection was 6 months ago or longer. It's best to get a booster dose before winter, but it's never too late. For more information on when, where and how your child can get vaccinated, go to [Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care - Getting your COVID-19 vaccination](https://raisingchildren.net.au/_media/external-links/a/australian-government-department-of-health-website-getting-your-covid-19-vaccination). You can find vaccination information for people aged 18 years and older at [Australian Government Department of Health and Aged Care - Who can get vaccinated](https://raisingchildren.net.au/_media/external-links/a/australian-government-department-of-health-who-can-get-vaccinated). You can also check your [state or territory government or health website](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/coronavirus-covid-19-guide/coronavirus-health-department-information). Vaccination after COVID-19 infection COVID-19 vaccination is recommended even if your child has had COVID-19. Vaccination can give stronger, longer-lasting protection than infection. If your child gets COVID-19, they should wait 6 months before having their next recommended dose. Why COVID-19 vaccination is important for children and teenagers COVID-19 vaccination prevents children and teenagers from getting very sick, being admitted to intensive care, or dying because of COVID-19. It also reduces their chance of getting long COVID. Also, when children and teenagers get vaccinated, they help to protect people who are at risk of getting very sick if they get COVID-19. And they help to protect people who can't be vaccinated, like newborns or people with complex medical needs. If fewer people get very sick from COVID-19, children and teenagers can keep doing all the things that are important for their wellbeing and development, like going to school, seeing friends, doing extracurricular and other community activities, and playing sport. When fewer people get sick from COVID-19, there's also less strain on our health and hospital system. And it reduces the mental health problems associated with isolating at home. COVID-19 vaccine safety and effectiveness for children and teenagers The [Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)](https://raisingchildren.net.au/_media/external-links/t/therapeutic-goods-administration) is continually checking that all vaccines are safe and working as they should for children and teenagers across the world. Global clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccines have shown that they're effective - that is, that they prevent severe COVID-19 in children and teenagers. The trials have also shown that the vaccines are safe for children and teenagers. COVID-19 vaccine doses for children younger than 12 years are smaller than the doses recommended for teenagers and adults. This is because clinical trials have found that smaller doses are safe and effective, so there's no need for larger doses. COVID-19 vaccination side effects COVID-19 vaccines are safe. Like all medicines, they can still have side effects. Common, mild side effects Pain or swelling at the injection site, tiredness, [headache](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/headache), muscle pain, [fever](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/coronavirus-covid-19-guide/fever) and chills are the most common side effects for children who get COVID-19 vaccines. These are generally mild and last only 1-2 days. Children under 5 years are more likely to experience fever, particularly if they've had COVID-19 before. Children under 5 years are also more likely to get [swollen lymph nodes](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/swollen-lymph-nodes). Rare side effects [Anaphylaxis](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/anaphylaxis) is a possible but very rare side effect of all vaccines, including COVID-19 vaccines. Immunisation providers monitor everyone for signs of anaphylaxis for 15 minutes following vaccination. If your child has a history of anaphylaxis or anaphylactic reactions to vaccines, talk with your GP or [allergy and immunology specialist](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/a-z-health-reference/allergy-specialist) before vaccination. [Myocarditis](https://raisingchildren.net.au/_media/glossary/myocarditis) and [pericarditis](https://raisingchildren.net.au/_media/glossary/pericarditis) are other possible but rare side effects of COVID-19 vaccination. But younger children are less likely to get these conditions than teenagers, particularly teenage boys. These conditions are usually mild, and people usually recover well from them. If your child has or has had recent myocarditis, pericarditis, acute heart failure, [acute rheumatic fever](https://raisingchildren.net.au/_media/glossary/rheumatic-fever) or [rheumatic heart disease](https://raisingchildren.net.au/_media/glossary/rheumatic-heart-disease), talk to your child's medical specialist before vaccination. In the weeks after your child's vaccination, you should seek urgent medical attention if your child has any of the following - chest pain, shortness of breath, awareness of their heartbeat, or feelings of faintness. Take your child to your GP or a hospital emergency department as soon as possible. Questions about COVID-19 vaccination: what to do It's OK to be careful about getting your child vaccinated. If you have questions about side effects or the safety of COVID-19 vaccination, talk with a health professional like your GP or an immunisation provider. These professionals are trustworthy sources of information and can address your concerns. It's also essential to get information from reliable and trustworthy online sources. Sources like government websites or the World Health Organization have information that's based on scientific research. This means you can rely on what they say. As your child's main role model, you can influence the way your child feels about vaccination. If you're positive about COVID-19 vaccination, this can help your child feel positive too. Other protective measures against COVID-19 All children and teenagers should take simple protective measures against COVID-19, regardless of whether they're vaccinated. These measures include: - maintaining physical distancing, including staying 1.5 m away from people you don't live with if you can [washing hands](https://raisingchildren.net.au/guides/coronavirus-covid-19-guide/hand-washing-in-pictures)and using personal hygiene - wearing face masks if recommended or required by your state or territory health authorities - following COVID-19 rules as required by your state or territory health authorities. You and your child's other parent might have different opinions about vaccination.
