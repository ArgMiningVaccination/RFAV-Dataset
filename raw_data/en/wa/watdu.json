It is comprehensive and heterogenous in scope and remains provocative and controversial in many academic circles. Assessment of the nature and potential contribution of anthroposophic medicine to whole person care and global health seems appropriate.Methods: Because of the heterogenous and multifaceted character of anthroposophic medicine, a narrative review format was chosen. A Health T echnology Assessment of anthroposophic medicine in 2006 was reviewed and used as a starting point. A Medline search from 2006 to July 2020 was performed using various search terms and restricted to English. Books,articles, reviews and websites were assessed for clinical relevance and interest to the general reader. Abstracts of German language articles were reviewed when available. Reference lists of articles and the author's personal references were also consulted.Results: The literature on anthroposophic medicine is vast, providing new ways of thinking, a holistic view of the world, and many integrating concepts useful in medicine. In the last /C2420 years there has been a growing research base and implemen- tation of many anthroposophical concepts in the integrated care of patients. Books and articles relevant to describing thefoundations, scientific status, safety, effectiveness and criticisms of anthroposophic medicine are discussed. Discussion: An objective and comprehensive analysis of anthroposophic medicine finds it provocative, stimulating and potentially fruitful as an integrative system for whole person care, including under-recognized life processes and psycho-spiritual aspects of human beings. It has a legitimate, new type of scientific status as well as documented safety and effec- tiveness in some areas of its multimodal approach. Criticisms and controversies of anthroposophic medicine are often a result of lack of familiarity with its methods and approach and/or come from historically fixed ideas of what constituteslegitimate science.

It was formulated and developed after requests from physicians (and later other therapists and as well as patients) to have a more complete and holistic view of the human being and broader and safer approaches to treat illnesses. After the peak of 19thcentury material- ism, some physicians felt that the ofcial paradigm of science and medicine was ignoring the whole patient and was never really fully addressed beyond the necessary material, physical aspects. At that time medical treat- ment was quite limited and with many adverse effectsfrom which patients suffered. Anthroposophic medicine was therefore was developed as a response to the deeply felt need by these physicians and patients to have theirfull human stature, as fourfold beings, consisting of physical, functional-biological, psychological-autonom- ic, and spiritual aspects, acknowledged and treated con- cretely. These four major factors of a human life operate in health and illness in obvious and not so obvious waysand are specically addressed in anthroposophic medicine. Background: What is Anthroposophic Medicine? In brief, anthroposophic medicine has several compo-nents. It takes the knowledge and insights from Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophy (\"consciousness and knowledge of the human being\") and applies the developed fourfold view mentioned above in a rigorous way to human health and illness. Deeper knowledge and insights into nature and its processes can then be used to make cor- responding natural remedies and other therapeutic inter-ventions for various corresponding illnesses or functional pathophysiology. Illness, whether functional or pathological, is seen fundamentally as an imbalance or abnormal functioning between the fourfold factors in an ill person's organism that must be corrected andbrought into functional harmony, and reverse, as much as is possible, the pathological diseased states. Symptoms are seen as an attempt by the human organ- ism that often-but not always\u2014inadequately or inap- propriately deal with the underlying pathology.Therefore, symptoms are not usually suppressed (unless the patient's life or an organ is in danger) and are instead appropriately guided with natural, conscientiously-prescribed remedies, or other modalities, to overcome the illness and regain balanced health.Depending on medical necessity, this may also include judicious use of conventional drugs and interventions. True health in anthroposophic medicine is seen as a bal-anced and dynamic state which is in accordance with the healthy fourfold functioning of the human being within three major functioning organic systems that are inter- actively and dynamically working throughout the human organism. These major functioning systems,both physiological and morphological, form another aspect of the human constitution and include thenerve-sense system, the rhythmic system and themetabolic-limb system, as these are differentiallyexpressed throughout the human being. While illnessescertainly are treated in anthroposophic medicine, there is usually an attempt to at the same time support the patient's own healing capacities ( salutogenesis ) in the context of their fourfold factors and threefold organicfunctioning systems. When delving into anthroposophic medicine, it becomes clear that another major component involvesan extensive reformulation of one's thinking, and alsoof the prevalent scientic views pertaining to what con- stitutes a human being. This includes understanding and evaluating the determinative biological, functional,psychological-autonomic, and spiritual levels in healthand illness. This reformulation and revisioning alsoapplies to surrounding nature, and ultimately to thewider universe. Another major component of anthroposophic medi- cine is the emphasis on the physician being a healing therapeutic force, to help the patient's own healingcapacities, alongside use of medical remedies, adviceon modiable lifestyle factors and use of importantnon-medication treatment modalities. Much can begained in a recovery towards health when the patienthas trust and condence in their physician, who displaysan appropriate mixture of caring, struggle, expertise,condence and circumspection. Thus, anthroposophicmedicine places a heavy emphasis on the personal and professional development of the physician. To truly practice anthroposophic medicine, the physician is invit-ed to embark on a conscious, meditative, moral andcognitive path of self-knowledge and self-transformation to develop a strong therapeutic willand become an ever more effective \"remedy\" (therapeu-tic agent) for the patient. Patients can sense a differencebetween this intense, empathic will to heal, and the oftenquick and routine approach that can be frequentlyemployed in conventional medicine. With this sense experienced by patients, they are stimulated to embark on the various and necessary aspects of their path tohealing. Complementary to the spiritual and moraldevelopment of the physician in anthroposophic medi-cine, is then the recognition of the patient as an auton-omous agent with dignity and self-responsibility, alongwith their need for professional guidance in stimulatingtheir organism's self-healing potential. Through the past one hundred years, anthroposophic medicine has developed into a sophisticated and com-plex form of integrative medicine. It originated inEurope but has now expanded to many countriesaround the world, including the US.2 Global Advances in Health and MedicinedealsUsing the epistemological (conceptual analysis of what is knowledge)1-4and philosophical,5-8scientif- ic,9-12Goethean scholarship results,13-15and the spiritual insights and methods of anthroposophy,4,16-27anthropo- sophic medicine has thereby developed a very complexand encompassing view of the human being in health and illness. It acknowledges and works with the integrated, real and dynamic workings of physical, functional-biological, psychological-autonomic, and spiritual fac- tors and processes in the human organism (also referred to as \"members\" of the integrated human entity). It greatly expands the reductionist, truncated and physical-chemical view and understanding of thehuman being by biomedicine and natural science.Anthroposophic medicine is not at all contrary to their legitimate conceptions and established results in their own realms. However, it strives to continually expandthe therapeutic options in medicine and therapy by including a more conscious use of many modalities including, healthy organic nutrition, 28-31various types of natural medicines and especially uniquely anthropo-sophic medicines, 32eurythmy therapy (imaginative, mindful movements),33-35therapeutic anthroposophic nursing procedures,36,37therapeutic mas- artistic modalities in creative speech for- mation and therapy,39-43music therapy, clay modeling, painting therapy, therapeutic drawing and color therapy.(Information on these are all found under the umbrellaorganization, AHA, Anthroposophic Health Association.) 44The Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex, APC,45gives a comprehensive and authoritative list of the therapeutic substances in anthroposophic medicine, their description, origin, constitution, and quality standards for manufacturing, for both homeo-pathic and anthroposophic medical products. Table 1gives more information on what are anthroposophic medicines. Further helpful, reliable and introductorysources on anthroposophic medicine are also avail-able 45-54(see Supplementary Materials, S1). Over the last few decades, anthroposophic medicine has developed and matured to the point that there is nowa research base with comprehensive technology assess-ment reports, 55,56a website with a collection of the latest research,57standardized training courses around the world58with international credentialing criteria,59and major English language textbooks and other works infamily medicine, 60internal medicine,61pediatrics,62-64 and functional morphology.54Other works exist in German. In addition, since 1995, anthroposophic medi-cine has established itself in six European academic uni- versity settings, including the Universities of Bern, Switzerland, Berlin /C19e), Witten/Herdecke, Freiburg, and Alfter (Alanus and Leiden in the Netherlands.There are 2 chairs (Witten/Herdecke and Berlin) andfour professorships explicitly dedicated to anthroposo-phic medicine Bern and medical education (Witten/Herdecke),and on anthroposophic treatment modalities(Witten/Herdecke, Freiburg and Alfter), and likewise, at least 20 Ph.D. researchers at these and other univer- sities (Peter Heusser, M.D., personal communication). Epistemological Basis and Conception of Anthroposophic Medicine Signicantly, a comprehensive publication, Anthroposophy and Science: An Introduction by Professor Peter Heusser, M.D., from Witten/Herdecke Table 1. Anthroposophic Medical Products. /C15Anthroposophic medications are conceived, developed, and produced in accordance with the anthroposophic knowledge of the human being, nature and substance, and are often, but not exclusively, potentized (serial 1:10 dilutions in between). /C15These medications come from mineral, plant and animal sources. /C15The method of production is specified in the German homeopathic pharmacopoeia, in the Swiss Pharmacopoeia and in the Anthroposophic Pharmaceutical Codex, and follows good manufacturing practices. /C15The routes of administrations include oral, rectal, vaginal, parenteral (intracutaneous, subcutaneous, or intravenous), or topical (applied to the skin, conjunctival sac, or nasal cavity). /C15In anthroposophic medical practice, anthroposophically-composed and potentized remedies, homeopathically potentized remedies, herbal medicine, and nutritional preparations are all used, in addition to conventional pharmaceuticals, if appropriate. /C15For regulatory purposes, the nonprofit, independent European Scientific Cooperative on Anthroposophic Medicinal Products (ESCAMP) investigates issues of system evaluation of anthroposophic medicine. /C15There are many unique forms of remedies in anthroposophic medicine. For example, the production and use of \"vegetabilized metals,\" where medicinal plants are grown in a soil with the addition of a corresponding small amount of a pulverized metal in the first season,but then in the next two subsequent seasons the soil is enriched with the composted plant from each season. Thereby, the medicinalplant itself \"potentizes\" the metal throughout the whole plant. A mother tincture-extract of the plant is made and then serially dilutedand mixed in 1:10 dilutions to make the final therapeutic product.

It also provides a conceptual basis for integrative medicine, critically evaluating the various elds of natural scienceas well as the philosophy of mind that impact medicine. A careful reading of this comprehensive work can pro- vide a modern, philosophically and scientically sound,holistic understanding of what it means be a human being. The resultant analysis, synthesis and outlook is potentially capable of overcoming the reductionistic,molecular-material, and one-sided naturalism of modern science and medicine. Not only can science and its results be reformulated to be more comprehen-sive and inclusive of non-sensory-based processes, it can also be expanded to include refreshingly new ways to actually participate in legitimate scienticresearch. 5,9-12,22Goethe originally introduced a non- reductionist, scientic method involving both intense observation and conscious participation in natural phe-nomena developing over time. 1,9,66This type of phenom- enological approach has more recently been advocated by other researchers.67-69Steiner elucidated a rm method- ological basis to Goethe's method and work, and expand- ed his approach to nature to include non-sensible, yet perceptible phenomena through an enhanced training ofour normal cognitive ability. 1,3,4,17,23Legitimate and reli- able science does not have to be solely limited to physical experimentation and quantication, as is usually assumedby many philosophers of science and practicing scientists. A Goethean approach to science has also led to some productive results. 68-73 Many people, both patients and non-patients, suffer biologically, psychologically and spiritually from the common, restricted, dogmatic and monoparadigmaticideology that science and biomedicine offer and practice (the exclusivity of scientic materialism, scientic natu- ralism or scientism ). 74There is a truly trenchant criticism of the ideology or world view of scientic materialism and reductionsim1,3,65,74,75that is demanding to be taken to heart by the medical profession. While the advances inscience and medicine since the 19 thcentury are epoch- making and frequently valuable, many can experience, directly or indirectly, the drawbacks, one-sidedness andadverse effects of modern medicine; hence, the rise in interest and use of integrative medicine and other med- ical systems by patients to more fully address their suf-fering. Many physicians recognize this need; this is borne out by a movement to address the one-sided convention- al approach with the establishment of academic integra-tive medicine clinics and research centers in many US medical schools (as well as in many European centers). The National Center for Complementary andIntegrative Health at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Academic Consortium for Integrative Medicine and Health both exist as a response to meeting the needs of patients and to the need for more systematicresearch. The Academic Consortium's denition of integrative medicine and health is \"integrative medicine and healthreafrms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropri-ate therapeutic and lifestyle approaches, healthcare pro- fessionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing.\" 76The anthroposophic medical approach has been pioneering this paradigm for 100 years. As result, patients who have experienced anthroposophic medicine report higher satisfaction compared to conventionalpatients. 77 Anthroposophic medicine may be considered unique as an integrative medical system in that it offers a con-sistent, coherent, rigorous, fully human, and a century- long integrative philosophy and scientic approach. This discipline informs the medical and functional diagnosisof illness, the promotion of more vibrant health ( saluto- genesis ), and the formulation, production and proper use of medicines and other therapeutic modalities. Allanthroposophic physicians must be fully trained and licensed in conventional medicine. Additional certied training is necessary \"to expand the art of healing byspiritual knowledge of the human being\" 23before becoming an anthroposophic physician. This expansion and training aims to provide a concerted effort to phil-osophically, scientically and conscientiously reformu- late one's \"scientic\" education, and to apprehend the insights of anthroposophy and anthroposophic medi-cine. 23,54,60-64Students are introduced to a rigorous meditative path of cognition-insight,4,16-21potentially leading to real and concrete spiritual knowledge aslived experience. Appropriate post-graduate training, usually with accountable certication, are also currently offered for many paramedical, healing professions suchas nursing, therapeutic rhythmical massage, eurythmy therapy, arts therapy, psychotherapy, creative speech formation, as well as in anthroposophic pharmacy.Trainings in other modalities, informed by anthroposo- phy, may also be envisaged. While anthroposophic medicine is ambitious in it attempts to be as comprehensive an integrative medical system as possible, it certainly needs and bases itself on the knowledge and advances of conventional medicine.It was never conceived to be an \"alternative\" or \"completely independent\" medical system ignoring the hard-won advances over the centuries in science andmedicine. 23Some of its historical roots also lie in the European context of homeopathy, naturopathy, alche- my and western herbal medicine.23,25,78-81However, it is4 Global Advances in Health and Medicines a rresultclear that the insights and methods of anthroposophic medicine provide many new approaches to the use of older natural remedies, also providing many originaland unique remedies and modalities for treatment 61,62 (Table 1). Thus, anthroposophic medicine provides afoundation for a comprehensive and rational and scien- tic system (including conventional medicine) for diag- nosis and therapy. 32,54,60-62,65,78-81It also has the potential to help integrate the various elds in integra- tive medicine into a rm, scientic and fully human foundation.65 Pillars of Anthroposophic Medicine As previously noted, anthroposophic medical physiciansare conventionally trained in academic medical institu- tions. They therefore see conventional medicines as potential contributors to attaining health and make judi- cious use of them as needed. In addition, anthroposo- phic medical practice also employs many complementary and alternative modalities if they have theoretical, prac- tical, or supportive research evidence base that informs their clinical and anthroposophical use to help make arelevant contribution to a person's health and develop- ment. In some circles, the use of homeopathy (or poten- tized substances), naturopathy, alchemy, as well as herbalism is controversial at best and deemed \"unscientic\" or \"irrational\" and \"unproven\" by skep- tics and critics, especially in some dogmatic, scientic and materialist circles. However, an unbiased review of the medical, nutritional and herbal literature shows beyond a doubt that plant substances, homeopathically potentized remedies and nutritional supplements have health-promoting and disease-modulating biological effects. 82-85As in any medical system, they certainly have to be used rationally and not in a haphazard way (which the training in anthroposophic medicine pro- vides). Homeopathy has its own extensive literaturedocumenting its effectiveness and safety in at least some conditions85-96(see Supplement S2). There are similarities and overlap between the medi- cal systems of homeopathy and anthroposophic medi-cine. 45,60-62,64,78However, there are important differences. Homeopathy uses, almost exclusively, theoral and topical routes, while anthroposophic medicineuses all the established routes of administration as isdone in conventional medicine (Table 1). Homeopathyoften uses much higher potencies (\"dilutions\") whileanthroposophic medicine sticks to lower potencies, usu-ally 30X or less. The therapeutic principle of homeopa-thy, the law of similars (\"like cures like\"), is recognizedin anthroposophic medicine, but it also recognizes 6other therapeutic principles 61(see Table 2). Lastly, anthroposophic remedies originate from the anthropo- sophic knowledge of the human being and nature's pro-cesses, while homeopathy relies on empiric \"provings\" ofsubstances in healthy volunteers. Perhaps much of this reality may irritate inveterate scientic materialists or other critics with their own vested interests-often provoking irrational derision. However, the positive clinical science in these areassimply cannot be denied. Organic, specically biodynamic food 97and nutrition- al science are also an important part of anthroposophicmedicine. Current research documents the health bene-ts of organic, minimally processed food which is largely free from all types of biocides, petrochemicals and heavy metals when compared to conventionally grownfood. 98-100Given current agricultural, military and busi- ness practices of using and then disposing of thousandsof potentially dangerous petrochemicals into the envi-ronment, it isn't surprising that the FDA has recentlyfound disturbing amounts of dangerous petrochemicaltoxins in food such as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkylsubstances (PFAS). 101,102Also, perfluorinated com- pounds in food have also been associated with a reducedvaccine humoral immune response (lower clinically Table 2. How Anthroposophic Medicines Work: Therapeutic Principles. 1. The formative, shaping and limiting principle of a medicine on a disease process, modulating its excess. 2. The alleviating or relieving principle of a disease process by a medicine's similar effect. This can be one aspect\u2014often hidden-in the homeopathic \"law of similars.\" 3. The appropriating therapeutic principle where a medicine can take over the salutogenetic or beneficial effects of symptoms or of a disease process. This can be another hidden aspect of the homeopathic \"law of similars.\" 4. The therapeutic principle of learning through a medicinal model. The medicine shows the diseased human organism what is the normal physiologic process to learn to imitate/perform. 5. The transforming or balancing principle where a medicine can help transform the excessive dominance of one of the threefold functional-organic poles in an illness to its reciprocal pole and thereby provide alleviation. 6. The dynamizing or fortifying principle where a medicine directly enhances the salutogenetic effects of the human organism's response to the illness. This is the classical conception of the homeopathic principle of the \"law of similars.\" 7. The overcoming therapeutic principle where an administered medicine stimulates the human organism to use its own strength to overcome the medicine which is similar in its effect to the foreign or disease process present.

There is a wealth of literature on the negative, toxic effects of conventionally grown food 104-107and the health benets of organic food.108Ideally, using biody- namic food would be part of an anthroposophic medical practice because of its organic farming methods (largelyfree of environmental toxins and contaminants) and itssuperior effects on soil quality. 109,110However, at this time, its availability is limited to certain regions in theUnited States, often operating in the context ofCommunity Supported Agriculture (CSA) systems.Current nutritional and biomedical research also pointto the importance of food quality as well as the use ofsome supplements in maintaining and promotinghealth. 111,112Recent research out of France from a large, prospective cohort study (NutriNet-Sant /C19e) has shown the detrimental effect of commonly-eaten, ultra-processed food on increased overall morality, risk ofcancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular dis-ease. 113-115 For many centuries, alchemy has been largely misun- derstood, undervalued and ridiculed by scientists, the laypublic, and physicians. However, its invaluable proto-scientic contributions have been well documented. 116 Western alchemy has contributed historically to anunderstanding of chemistry and pharmaceutical process-es for natural substances. In anthroposophic medicine, atransformed and more scientic, alchemical and three-fold Paracelsian thinking is being applied to understand-ing nature, its relationship to the human being,functional pathophysiology, medical diagnosis, andtreatment. 23,36,54,60-62Pharmaceutical processes employed in anthroposophic medical pharmacy userenewed and more modern insight into alchemical pro-cesses in the manufacture of natural anthroposophicremedies. This approach is in a manner that is compat-ible with scientic consciousness and understandingand not shrouded in mysticism or arcane terminology. 45,78,80,81,117 Potential Contribution of Anthroposophic Medicine to Conventional Medical Care Anthroposophic medicine is a comprehensive and inte- grative medical system that can complement convention-al medicine in many elds. There are currently, forexample, ve specied major \"care areas\" that show itsparticular promise and relevance in contributing to cur-rent medical practice. These ve care areas already havehad considerable development in anthroposophic medi-cine. 118Specically, these care areas are: 1. Pregnancy, birth and early childhood as well as developmental dis-orders and their related disabilities. 2. The treatment offever and febrile infections (especially respiratory ill- nesses, otitis media and urinary tract infections). In view of the current crisis with antibiotic resistance, anthroposophic medicine has a long tradition of treatingthe vast majority of these types of infections with much reduced use of antibiotics and antipyretics, 119-121includ- ing even some cases of hospitalized pneumonia (bothviral and bacterial), with good clinical outcome. 1223. Mental health treatment, such as sleep disturbances, common forms of anxiety and depression, post- traumatic stress disorders, involving only minimal andjudicious use of psychotropic medications. 4. Oncology, including adjuvant treatment with Viscum album L. (European white berry mistletoe) in various pharmaceu-tical preparations, along with other conventional and complementary oncologic services. 5. Palliative medi- cine, pain therapy and management, and the accompa-niment of dying patients, including the provision of psychospiritual care. Within anthroposophic clinical contexts, the need for opioid medications clinicallyappears to be reduced. In summary, anthroposophic medicine can offer sup- porting treatments and therapies alongside conventionalmedicine, especially but not only in the above elds which are so challenging for practitioners with current limited tools (pharmaceutical drugs, short appointments,and limited availability of effective psychotherapy). Itsspiritual and integrative insights, as well as its differen- tiated vocabulary and enhanced theoretical constructs, offer tools to address the desired but unmet biophysical,functional, psychological, and spiritual needs of the human being, both in sickness and in health. 65,123The preferences, perspectives and motivations of patients,especially those with chronic diseases, and the limited offering of conventional options, have been major driv- ers for the advancement of integrative medicine andanthroposophic medicine in the US. Scientific Basis of Anthroposophic Medicine Given its roots in the spiritual science of anthroposophy,the question can be asked as to whether anthroposophicmedicine is in fact, genuinely scientically based or rather the mere construct of an eccentric philosophical system and a reversion to pre-scientic belief systems. Inother words, does anthroposophic medicine have a gen- uine scientic basis or is it a mere non-science or a pseudoscience? The previously mentioned book, Anthroposophy and Science: An Introduction, 65clearly delineates the scientif- ic character and basis of anthroposophic medicine andanthroposophical spiritual science . The author points out that through rigorous self-observation in the act of thinking and then subsequent conceptual analysis of the experience, one can come to the conclusion that6 Global Advances in Health and Medicinemortalitythe access to full reality is not simply derived only from the external world by perceptions or impressions through the sense organs or their instrumental exten- sions. Only when the act of perceiving is brought togeth- er with the corresponding, inherent concept in the act of cognition (the act of knowing) is the full reality appre-hended. This epistemology (theory of knowledge) is called objective ontological idealism (also known as uni- versal realism, empirical ontological idealism, or simply, objective idealism , as Steiner termed it 2) In other words, ideas and concepts are a real and an objective part of fullreality. Panel 1. The objective idealism of Rudolf Steiner Ideas and concepts are a real and an inherent part of the full reality that we can come to know through cognition; they are not arbitrary, subjective inventions of the mind. They havereal, ontological status; that is, concepts and ideas corre-sponding to the perceptions we receive are inherent andobjective constituents of reality, but we experience themwithin the mind. As well as outer sense perceptions there are also inner perceptions derived from embodiment or the psyche ( e.g. pain, thoughts, desires, feelings, etc.); both may becomeobjects of our perceptions. Without the corresponding con-cept or complex of concepts, a world of only observed per-ceptions, whether inner and outer, would be completely unin-telligible and appear as an entangled jumble of meaningless andunassociated flow of perceptions. It becomes clear that linking concepts to perception forms a necessary part of accessing reality. Without validating thepre-existence of concepts and their associated ideas, that wecan apprehend, there really is no possibility of obtaining anyknowledge of anything whatsoever. More importantly, itwould invalidate the very aims and existence of any true sci-ence. In other words, science would not be possible. Thisachievement in observation, insight and conceptual analysis,was developed by Rudolf Steiner and described in detail in The Philosophy of Freedom 3and further elaborated by Heusser.65 In science, medicine, and research in general, the fun- damental scientic methodology consists in uniting inner or outer observations with their associated concepts in order to grasp the underlying lawful connections in an act of judgement or discernment. This universal process of cognition accompanied through an act of judgment con- stitutes the real fundamental scientic method. The care- ful, systematic application of these lawful connections to a eld of study constitutes real science. While this type ofapplication of our conscious cognitive process in the sci- entic method requires extensive training and effort, it doesn't have to be characterized exclusively as consisting of experimentation, hypothesis generation, mathemati- cal quantication, statistics, atomistic or molecularthinking, etc. To insist, as some do, that science must involve experimentation, quantication, deductive and inductive reasoning, reductionism, and only employ the current methods of natural scientists, and that all elsemust be speculation or worse, is a historically and cul- turally determined and uncritical view of current con- vention. As a general rule, most physicians andscientists haven't had the time and exposure to critically look at the epistemological and metaphysical founda- tions (\"rst principles\") of science. 124,125 Steiner and Goethe's methodology offer empirical and rational accounts of the emergent, systemic and higher-order properties of biological life functions and psychospiritual levels of human functioning in health and disease. While the methods of current natural sci- ence (analysis, reductionism and mechanisms) directedat the physical-chemical and molecular levels are legiti- mate, necessary and valuable, the emergent and higher order properties in the human organism cannot begrasped this way. Without additional, empirical and rational higher-order concepts the human being simply can't be fully understood\u2014and patients sense this whenthey are subjected to many conventional medical practi- ces and attitudes. The schematic Table 3 below may be helpful to see how anthroposophic physicians and scientists view the human being and nature. In this simplied table, each of the 4 hierarchical levels or realms of nature and thehuman being have interactions, influences and coordi- nated responses with a level above or below (see double-headed arrows). The three higher levels haveemergent properties that cannot be predicted nor explained by a lower level. 65In addition, the higher levels have a determinative and organizing effect onthe lower ones. The recent results of science in physics, chemistry, biology, genetics, psychology, neuroscience, consciousness studies, and philosophy of mind allpoint to higher, more complex and emergent laws that determine the expression of lower levels. It requires intense study and practice for this to be fully recognized.This is all discussed in detail in Heusser's book, Anthroposophy and Science . 65 Table 3 has technical terms introduced by Rudolf Steiner such as etheric body, astral body, and \"I\". They have specic and somewhat unique meanings in anthro- posophy and anthroposophic medicine that are muchbroader than the corresponding terms, \"life\", \"soul\" and \"spirit\". These technical terms include, beyond the common terms, broader supra-sensible aspects as well asorganic and unconscious aspects working in human anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and pathophysiolo- gy. 18,23,24,54,60-62Looking at characteristic published medical literature,35,41,46,50,54,60-64,81it becomes clear that anthroposophic medicine is not just a conglomera- tion of the various complementary approaches, but anBartelme 7original and integrative, multimodal and individualized way to address the full, integrated, fourfold human composition. Although the current scientic approaches are often helpful and necessary when employed in scientic endeavors in both the natural and social sciences today, they are not, however, a necessary prerequisite to do science. Furthermore, the repeated dogmatic criticisms by scientic materialists in conventional med- icine against nonconventional aspects of integrative medicine threaten to stifle free development of legitimate scientic inquiry and the progress and validation of var- ious schools of integrative medicine, including anthro- posophic medicine. The human biopsychospiritual organism is very complex, and no one isolated medical paradigm can possibly have the complete answer when addressing the complex needs of sick human beings. What seems to be needed is pluralistic array of evidence-informed and safe medical approaches to more fully meet the suffering patient; not a restricted and materialistic monoparadigm of biomedicine (exclud- ing other medical systems) that may indeed serve somespecic needs but whose overreliance has led to many of our current problems of microbial antibiotic resistance,expensive pharmaceuticals with signicant adverse effects, and pollution of the water supply and environ- ment by current medical-pharmaceutical practices. The current exponential costs of modern biomedicine are also not sustainable by any socio-economic system and this needs to be fully recognized (and addressed). Criteria to Discern What Truly is a Science In 2018 an important paper published in Complementary Therapies in Medicine by Baars et al., addresses, from another point of view, the scientic status of anthropo- sophic medicine.126They assessed the scientic status of anthroposophic medicine based on the demarcation cri- teria proposed by contemporary philosophy of science. Looking at eight publications, they combined all the var- ious proposed criteria to demarcate (\"set boundaries to\") true science from non-science signicant scientic attributes) and pseudosci- ence (i.e., supercially appearing as a science), as well as to characterize true science in medicine. Eleven criteria were culled and condensed from the relevant literature and ordered in logical sequence. See Table 4 for the list of the succinct eleven criteria from the authors' paper.Table 3. The Anthroposophical View of Nature and the Human Being. Minerals Plants Animals Humans Phenomena & Emergent Proper/g415es Spirit Note: As previously briefly mentioned, there are other clinically helpful views of the human being such as Steiner's proposed scientific principle o f threefold functional-organic systems (relating to the nerve-sense system, the rhythmic system and the metabolic-limb system) that can be dynamically combin ed with the above basic fourfold description. Thus, the four factors can be seen to be working differentially in the three major functional-organic systems w orking throughout the human organism. The anthroposophic medical literature elaborates this in considerable detail.22,23,54,60-628 Global Advances in Health and MedicineBaars et al. go into detail to show how anthroposo- phic medicine meets all these criteria and thus has scien-tic status and validity. Also, Heusser's book, Anthroposophy and Science , 65can complement and elab- orate what is in the Baars et al. article. Their consideredconclusion doesn't mean that anthroposophic medicineand anthroposophy aren't controversial for many con-ventionally trained physicians and scientists. However,looking at the historical development of natural sciencemay provide insights into the basis of the controversy. Modern science had much of its historical beginnings from the natural Western philosophy of the 16th and17th centuries especially from the work of Ren /C19e Descartes, Galileo Galilei, Francis Bacon,Isaac Newton, Robert Boyle, and John Locke. 124,125 These natural philosophers (early scientists) and mathe-maticians dened and developed the naturalistic episte-mological stage as well as the mathematical, atomistic,and skeptical foundations for natural science and its methodology. The decision and claim were made that in order for natural science to progress and be moreobjective, it needed to focus on primary, measurable,and quantitative qualities, such as number, mass, veloc-ity, temperature, extension, etc. of the sense-perceptibleworld (scientic naturalism), and ignore secondary qual- ities like color, sound, taste, smell, cold, warmth, etc.produced as \"subjective\" sensations in human observers. Later, this same approach was applied to the human being. Thus, mind, consciousness, emotions, feelings,pain, etc. were viewed as only complex neurochemical and neurophysiological ( physical ) phenomena that pro- duces or causes the qualities of consciousness. This his-torical, philosophical and scientic decision hasadvanced the endeavors and fruitfulness of natural sci-ence up to this day. However, Goethe 9,66-73and Steiner1,3,4,10,11,16,18,22-27demonstrate, for example, that there are other ways to engage in legitimate and rigorousscientic work that involve secondary sensory qualities andalso supra-sensible phenomena (like consciousness and mind); those that are immediately accessible to ourconsciousness, and those that require considerableenhancement of our latent capacities through systematic,mental meditative exercises. 17,19-21,23 To experience and learn to see in a new, scientic and phenomenological way, some works can be particularlyhelpful. This would include Steiner's work on the epis-temology (how do we come to truly know?), the experi-ence and observation of pure thinking, and theTable 4. Criteria for the Demarcation of Science and Non-Science, Based on Contemporary Philosophy of Science. 1. The presence of a community whose members: a. have received specialized training about the domain of discourse, its concepts and its methodological basis;b. communicate with and learn from each other;c. use a well-structured and transparent language. 2. The presence of a domain with which a scientific community is concerned.3. The presence of a set of problems that are specific for the domain and need to be solved by the scientific community.4. The pursuance of a set of goals in dealing with some problems.5. The presence of an axiomatic basis or metaphysical background that does not contain metaphoric, falsified or cryptic axioms. 6. The presence of a conceptual basis of the research field; the entirety of antecedently existing conceptual systems (concepts, descriptions, hypotheses and theories) used by the scientific community in dealing with the research domain. 7. The presence of qualitatively good concepts, according to a set of subcriteria. A concept is qualitatively good, when it is a. consistent,b. transparent,c. in line with other scientific theories,d. empirically testable,e. relatively stable,f. to be further developed as a result of new scientific results,g. original and enriching,h. with explanatory power,i. without overloaded ontology. 8. The presence of a set of qualitative, good, concrete and abstract methods applied in scientific research as demonstrated by: a. the use of reliable state-of-the-art methods of inquiry,b. organized skepticism. 9. The presence of a deontic basis: a set of moral and legal rules regulating the research by prescribing what types of action are permitted, forbidden, or obligatory (e.g. disinterestedness with regard to the domain of the research field). 10. The presence of research products in the form of knowledge that is made publicly available by becoming published in journals, books or other media. 11. The research frame (the whole of domain, problems, goals, axiomatic basis, conceptual basis, methods and deontic basis) of the institution stands in a tradition of other research frames and research products, produced by other scientific research institutions.

First, the philosophical-epistemological argument considers that the foundation of a true science and its scientic method consists of two parts. The rstpart is the careful and systematic application of a uni-versal cognitive process, whereby the intense and struc- tured observations are combined with associated concepts, corrected, if necessary, and then repeated invarious contexts. The second part is that, with repeated observations and concept building, there has to be an act of judgment to discover the underlying and reliable rela-tionships and laws. Of course, sophisticated, quantita-tive methods may also be of immense help; they are an essential component in a scientic endeavor when study- ing the quantitative aspect of relationships and laws.However, they are not necessarily essential with respectto observed qualities in human beings and nature. Therefore, a more objective scientic approach to qual- ities-even subjective states when coupled with strictattention to outer and inner perceptions-(as developed by Goethe and Steiner) is equally justied and necessary. This type of science has a legitimate, necessary and inde-pendent right to scientic activity alongside the usuallypreferred quantitative ones. Second, Goethean science is an example of a new type of science that allows us to perceive sensory phenomena in new ways and come to fruitful results. Anthroposophy and anthroposophic medicine have intensied andexpanded the Goethean approach to involve spiritualphenomena and forces that are acting in the workings of the perceived sensible world. Third, looking at the eleven criteria that contempo- rary philosophy of science has developed as to what distinguishes (demarcates) a science from pseudoscienceand non-science, a more objective consideration showsthat anthroposophic medicine meets all the criteria for a true science (however early it may be in its current stage of development). Safety of Anthroposophic Medicines Historical evidence, long clinical experience, and goodclinical research attest to the safety of both homeopathicand anthroposophic medicinal products (remedies), despite their differences. Because of the therapeutic, non-classical use of homeopathic remedies with anthro- posophic medical practice, the safety of the formeralso speaks to some extent to the safety of the latter. 93-96,127-130Potentized remedies are usually recog- nized as extremely safe based on their method of serialdilutions and proper mixing. Many anthroposophic medicines and all homeopathic ones are considered \"potentized,\" despite their dilute concentrations.Further information about homeopathic effectiveness and safety research is available (see Supplement S2). There is high-quality research on the safety of anthro- posophic medicine (which includes herbal tinctures and potentized products) published in comprehensive Health Technology Assessment Reports and in peer-reviewedmedical journals. 55-57,131-135This comprehensive litera- ture assessment strongly supports the historical and clin- ical experience of anthroposophic practitioners. Recent research by Hamre HJ, et al documents the very rare occurrence of adverse \"drug\" reactions in anthroposophic medicine.131This was a large, prospec- tive, multicenter, observational pharmacovigilance study on anthroposophic medical practice over 10 years with a mean follow-up of 27 months. Adverse \"drug\" reactions(ADRs) were monitored in 44,662 patients with 311,731 anthroposophic medicinal prescriptions of 1722 different medicinal products, including anthroposophic mistletoe.Overall, ADRs of any intensity (WHO standard criteria) occurred in 0.071% of anthroposophic medicinal pre- scriptions (rare) and in 0.502% of patients receivinganthroposophic remedies without a prescription (self- use of over-the-counter remedies; ADRs were usually mild and transient). Serious ADRs were extremely rare(0.0003%). Compared to the known frequency of ADRs from prescriptions and non-prescription pharmaceuticaldrugs, anthroposophic remedies are extremely safe and with very much less documented serious ADRs. This large, prospective study, documenting adverse reactionsin anthroposophic medicine, is in accord with current clinical experience. Special preparations of anthroposophic European white berry mistletoe ( Viscum album L.) have name rec- ognition in Europe and are used in adjuvant cancer ther- apy. These preparations of mistletoe (with various tradenames) have been systematically studied for safety. Using the Network Oncology database, a conjoint clin- ical registry of German hospitals and outpatient practi-tioners specialized in anthroposophic medicine and mistletoe treatment, two published studies in 2014 dem- onstrate the safety of intravenous 132and were mild to mod- erate (total 4.6% of patients) with no serious ADRs. Use10 Global Advances in Health and Medicineal.of subcutaneous anthroposophic mistletoe resulted in ADRs in 14.7% of patients, with most ADRs being mild to moderate (95.9%) and severe in 4.2%. There were no serious or life-threatening reactions. All ADRclassications are based on published WHO criteria. A systematic and comprehensive review in 2011 of the safety of higher dosages of Viscum album L. came to a similar conclusion regarding the published safety of anthroposophic mistletoe. 134Another retrospective cohort study using the German Network Oncology reg-istry of 1361 patients also documented expected, mild- moderate ADRs with higher doses of one preparation of anthroposophic mistletoe. 135All this published data on safety corresponds to the long clinical experience of knowledgeable anthroposophic mistletoe use. There are isolated, rare and largely uncritical pub- lished case reports claiming a variety of serious ADRs from mistletoe such as cardiac arrest, coma, death, delir- ium, hallucinations, skin necrosis, hepatotoxicity, pan-creatic hemorrhage, seizures, sarcoidosis, renal failure, allergic reactions and anaphylaxis. Some of these have also been mentioned in editorials and reviews of mistle-toe. 136-140A careful review of the primary literature of these cases demonstrate a very biased and uncritical reporting.55,134Many cases involved mixed formulations that may or may not have had mistletoe as one ingredi- ent. Most cases did not involve anthroposophic mistletoe, but instead involved other formulations containing somecomponents of Viscum album L., or did not have super- vision by a knowledgeable physician, or involved toxic- ity studies in animals. Anthroposophic mistletoe doeshave well known and expected immunologic effects such as fever, flu-like symptoms, local inflammatory reactions, pruritus at the injection site, or other mildnon-specic symptoms. Anaphylactic reactions, angioe- dema/urticaria and allergic and pseudo-allergic reactions have been very rarely reported. 134,141 The Anthroposophic Medicine Outcomes Study (AMOS),119an observational cohort study of 1,631 German adult and children outpatients treated for avariety of common, chronic conditions in a real-world context also demonstrated a low incidence of mild to modest and transient adverse reactions. A detailedsafety analysis conrmed adverse reactions to anthropo- sophic remedies were 3% of users, 2% of remedies used, 3% in eurythmy therapy, 1% in art therapy and 5% inrhythmical massage. Furthermore, there have been recent publications in the elds of obstetrics and pediatrics that also documentthe safety and clinical effective use of anthroposophic medicines, with both oral and intravenous routes of administration. 120,121,142-146 In contrast, many review articles on adverse drugs reactions from FDA-approved prescription medications (most of these are from common drugs like antibiotics,non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and anti- depressants) estimate about 8% incidence in the generaloutpatient population and account for 3-10% hospitaladmissions (more serious reactions). 147-149Antibiotic -associated diarrhea is quite common; between 5-39%of patients experience it. 150Other common and disturb- ing side effects from antibiotics include childhood obe-sity when used before age 2 years, 151allergic reactions,152 and increase in risk of IBS (irritable bowel syndrome).153 In addition, one study revealed about 46% of emergencydepartment visits in children are for ADRs 154and up to 1 in 12 concurrent pediatric users of prescription medi-cations are at risk for a potentially major drug-druginteractions. 155All these authors recognize the large public health and medical problem this causes in termsof patient safety and medical cost. The use of anthropo-sophic medicine in an anthroposophic practice has beenshown to markedly reduce antibiotic use and is a corecare area where anthroposophic medical experience hassomething to contribute to worldwide problems inpublic health and medicine. 118-122 Despite the relatively high level of adverse pharma- ceutical drug reactions in conventional medicine, theyhave a legitimate place in a truly comprehensive medicalapproach and anthroposophic medical physicians usethem judiciously when indicated. Safety of Non-Oral and Non-Topical Routes for Anthroposophic Medicines There is a general consensus in the medical profession and in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)that non-oral and non-topically applied skin medica-tions (such as injections, intravenous infusions, and oph-thalmic eye drops) have a higher risk of ADRs invulnerable populations, such as the elderly, infants andchildren, and pregnant women. While this seems gener-ally true for pharmaceutical medications, based on clin-ical experience and current pharmacologic knowledgebase, this is not evidence based with respect to anthro-posophic medicines. There is a recognized high demand and a genuine need by patients, physicians and other prescribers fornon-oral and non-topical routes of administration ofanthroposophic medicines. These routes of administra-tion are an important part of the approach in anthro- posophic medicine and have been employed in clinical use for 100 years with an excellent safetyrecord. 119-121,131-135,142-146,156They are used by physi- cians in appropriate clinical circumstances in pediatrics,in pregnant women and in the elderly. These routes are often employed for a variety of legit- imate clinical reasons with appropriate precautions andadhering to standards for sterility and purity. The rea-sons for their use include: more rapid effect; better, moreBartelme 11enhanced effect; higher bioavailability (avoids the rst pass effect in the gastrointestinal tract and liver); easier use in some clinical situations; administration is possible at a precise location; combination with other therapiesor medication is made possible; better treatment compli-ance; and in some cases, the oral and topical route is simply not possible. 157 As noted earlier regarding safety, anthroposophic mistletoe is an important, sterile, botanical anthroposo-phic medical product used almost exclusively as paren- teral injections (subcutaneous, locally injected into the tumor or intravenous) for cancer therapy. Its oral use isless effective. In marked contrast to conventional, pharmaceutical, chemotherapeutic preparations with their known seriousadverse drug reactions (both oral and intravenousroutes), there is considerable research to document the safety of anthroposophic intravenous and subcutaneous mistletoe preparations. 132-134All anthroposophic reme- dies and medical products are procured and manufac-tured under strict standards. 45,117Another example of a safe, well-tolerated and effective anthroposophic intra- com-bination of Bryophyllum 7X. This preparation is used instead of conventional tocolytic agents to effectively and safely arrest pretermlabor. 142-145 Effectiveness of Anthroposophic Medicine-Overview Without governmental or much institutional support, there is a body of research that supports the cost effec- tiveness of anthroposophic medicine.55,56,119The research base of anthroposophic medicine (using both non-medicinal modalities as well as herbal and poten- tized remedies) is modest, but still growing. The compre-hensive health technology assessment report onanthroposophic medicine and its update 55,56together evaluated a total of 265 clinical trials with 38 random- ized clinical trials (RCTs). The authors' assessment wasthat the trials were of varying design and quality, withmany having major limitations. Nevertheless, most stud- ies did demonstrate good clinical outcomes, with few side effects, high patient satisfaction and likely lowercosts. The authors noted that even the prospective, observational trials and RCTs of better quality still tended to show positive results. 56Further quality research was urged. The AMOS study on German outpatients previously mentioned, did sophisticated analyses to assess the con- tribution of the anthroposophic treatment to thepatients' overall experience of improvement. 119In sensi- tivity analyses combined with bias suppression, the researchers found that a maximum of 37% of the improvement seen in patients could be explained byother factors such as natural recovery, regression to the mean, adjunctive therapies, and non-response bias.The conclusion was that the multimodal treatments inanthroposophic medicine have real effects for patients in regaining their health. Since the 2011 health technology assessment update report, there have been further RCTs and systematicreviews on various aspects of anthroposophic medicine,including reference to ongoing trials. 57As examples of currently published studies, a well-designed RCT in 2013 demonstrated highly signicant increased survival inpatients with advanced pancreatic cancer that failed ini-tial conventional chemotherapy 158and also demonstrat- ed in 2014 signicant clinical benets in many quality oflife parameters including weight gain and decreased fatigue (very unusual in therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer). 159As previously mentioned, a comparative, cross-sectional eld study comparing primary careanthroposophic medicine to conventional medicine dem-onstrated that anthroposophic medical patients had ahigher satisfaction with their physicians and theapproach to their problems. 77 Eurythmy therapy is an imaginative and mindful movement modality frequently used in anthroposophicmedicine. Consequently, its clinical effects have alsobeen studied. There has been a 2015 systematic review(of non-RCTs) review.161A 2017 three-armed pragmatic trial with a multimodal treatment arm thatincluded therapeutic eurythmy, showed that this multi-modal treatment was superior to standard aerobic train-ing in reducing cancer-related fatigue in breast cancer survivors. 162Another three-armed RCT of the clinical comparative effectiveness of yoga, eurythmy therapyand physical therapy for chronic low back pain hasrecently been completed and its published results arepending. 163 Of course, there is much other published literature on anthroposophic medicine that also include severalmodern, rigorously-documented case reports (using pub-lished CARE guidelines) and real-world observationalstudies pointing to its effectiveness. 57,135,164 Prospective Observational Studies in Support of Anthroposophic Medicine and its Related TherapeuticRecommendations Several prospective observational studies on anthropo- sophic medical practices document the very low use of antibiotics and can likely contribute to an effective approach to reduce antibiotic use more generally andreduce the problem of antibiotic resistance (selectionbias cannot be completely ruled out). 119-121,165,16612 Global Advances in Health and MedicineorFurthermore, epidemiological studies on children living an anthroposophic lifestyle with natural child- birth, breast feeding, organic food, fermented foods, Steiner education (Waldorf Schools), selective vaccina-tions, exposure to largely benign febrile childhood ill- nesses, limited or no antipyretics, and very limited antibiotic exposure, leads to less atopy (allergies), 167,168 to altered and more diverse (likely benecial) intestinal flora,169and to less stress indicators like lower salivary cortisol levels.170-172The large, careful, cross-sectional, multinational PARSIFAL study with analytical meth- ods to exclude disease-related modication from earlyatopic illness exposure, also has shown that measles infection, but not measles vaccination, is associated with less allergic disease. 173The exclusion of children within the rst year of life with wheezing illness or eczema helps strengthen the cross-sectional study's results because the timing of MMR vaccination andmeasles infection is usually after the rst year (in the US and Europe); the effects of either measles or measles vaccination can then be assessed. Finally, the prospec-tive ALADDIN birth cohort studies with 490 children have documented that an anthroposophic lifestyle is associated with less food sensitization in early child-hood 174and that it is also associated with less parent- reported food hypersensitivity, recurrent wheeze and IgE sensitization.175Admittedly, there have been conflicting other studies with some negative ndings, but these last two studies are of better quality than most. Regarding the health effects of attending a Waldorf/ Steiner school, an exploratory, multicenter, cross- sectional study comparing Steiner school graduatesand a control group, indicated improved health out- comes as adults with small decrease in osteoarthritis and allergic rhinitis and less symptom burden fromback pain, insomnia, joint pain, GI symptoms and imbalance, 176as well as easier adjustment to demands of higher education.177While these results are admitted- ly preliminary and quite modest, they nevertheless point to the spiritual, health-promoting effects of education that takes the child's development into account in theway that Steiner envisioned. 63,178-181When looking at all of Steiner's statements and indications for Waldorf edu- cation, it becomes clear that there appears to be an untapped potential to improve the effectiveness and health-promoting effects of Waldorf education.178,181 Review of Anthroposophic Mistletoe for Cancer Anthroposophic mistletoe treatment for cancer is con- sidered controversial and debated in many oncology circles. Over the years there have been both positiveand negative systematic or meta-analytic reviews of both non-anthroposophic mistletoe extract formulations and specically anthroposophic mistletoe therapy forcancer. A 2019 systematic review (published in two parts) of published RCTs from 1995 to October 2017 of mistletoe therapy in cancer by Jutta Huebner and colleagues came to a negative conclusion about mistle-toe's potential effect on survival, safety, quality of life and toxicity of conventional cancer treatment. 182,183The authors cited many flaws or weaknesses of the studies(including both anthroposophically-prepared mistletoe and standardized extracts), as well as many potential sources of bias that could have contributed to the posi-tive results of some reported RCTs. However, a detailed look at the authors' assessment about potential biases in some of the positive RCTs aswell as at their the text of the article reveals their nega- tive bias towards anthroposophic medicine in general, towards RCTs of anthroposophic mistletoe specically,and flaws in their risk of bias assessment that negatively impacted their assessment of the quality of the RCTs. 182,183Huebner and colleagues stated that \"most studies did not show any effect of mistletoe on survival\" and also stated that most of the reviewed RCTs were small (with risk of bias for positive results). Their nega-tive assessment doesn't seem justied when 5 of the 14 RCTs did show a positive and signicant effect on over- all survival and another 6 of the 14 RCTs demonstrateda favorable trend. 184A meta-analysis and systematic review seems indicated to increase the power of separate and varied controlled trials to detect a real difference insurvival and quality of life. As one response, a recent rigorous, quantitative and comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of global quality of life out-come in cancer patients treated with mistletoe detected a robust, medium-sized and clinically relevant improve- ment (pooled standardized mean difference, d \u00bc0.61, 95% CI 0.41-0.81, p <0.00001). 185 In addition, a reply to criticisms of the well-designed and well-executed RCT on anthroposophic mistletoetherapy for advanced pancreatic cancer by Tr \u20acoger, et al was published. 186Huebner and colleagues also state that the safety of mistletoe therapy in cancer is not estab-lished. 182However a much more widely scoped and com- prehensive systematic review (69 human clinical trials and 49 animal experiments) by Kienle, et al comes toan opposite conclusion and states that even higher dos- ages of mistletoe are safe, without immunosuppression or signicant adverse reactions. 134 Going any further into the vast literature on mistletoe therapy for cancer and the attendant details of the stud- ies does not seem fruitful and is beyond the scope of thisnarrative review. Readers interested in further details can consult the relevant references mentioned, as well as other reviews. 187,188Besides the recent meta-analysis and systematic review on quality of life,185there have been more recent, encouraging publications focusing on safety and efcacy,189-191and two positive meta-Bartelme 13inas article the text of theirin al.analyses and systematic reviews of controlled trials of fermented mistletoe (IscadorVR) for overall survival in cancer patients.192,193 Some further general observations can made regard- ing research into anthroposophic medicine and it's mis- tletoe preparations. Without public or large pharmaceutical rm funding, large RCTs of mistletoe in cancer are difcult (e.g., trouble with recruitment where many western patients refuse to be randomizedinto a placebo group, lack of funding, etc.) and are very expensive to do. Hence, many mistletoe RTCs are small and there has been more focus on larger, prospec- tive observational studies or controlled and rigorous ret- rospective studies (called \"retrolective\" studies) that canstill give valuable and reasonably reliable information. Most current systematic reviews and meta-analyses are limited by focusing too exclusively on randomizedclinical trials, most often only focusing on the methodo- logic and reporting quality of the trials and ignoring the critical component of the clinical protocol and dosing regimens used. For example, many of the negative RCTs on anthroposophic mistletoe employed lowdoses or slow dose titrations in their trials or used an inappropriate host tree. Even the positive RCTs current- ly published only have used moderate doses. Most researchers do not seem to be very familiar with proper (presumably more successful) and safe clinicalprotocols with individualized treatment of mistletoe used in current clinical practice. Lastly, most reviews of mistletoe oncologic treatment lump together all mis- tletoe products and only rarely focus only on anthropo- sophic mistletoe. The limitations of the \"gold standard\"RCT have been recognized for years, 194,195although most researchers and proponents of RCTs seem to be either unaware or discount their importance. Despite the critics' correct assessment of some of the weakness in the clinical trial data (especially high risk of bias from inability to blind the treatment185) one can conclude that even the best trials, with a proper clinical protocol, show a positive effect of mistletoe therapy incancer for overall survival and quality of life. Further high-quality clinical trial data\u2014of various designs- are still necessary, and there are at least four well-designed, moderate-sized and registered phase III RCTs on anthroposophic medical cancer treatment (1 on euryth-my therapy and 3 on mistletoe) nishing their recruit- ment phase (Gunver Kienle, M.D., personal communication and Matthes et al. 184). Common Misconceptions about Anthroposophic Medicine The following are common critiques and misconceptions about anthroposophic medicine.1. Anthroposophic medicine and anthroposophy aren't really anything like a science (as we conceive of andexperience today), and instead are based on \"occult notions,\" \"mystical ideas,\" fantastic notions and con- nections, religious ideas from Eastern religions andgnostic Christianity, reversion to Druidism, or ideas of \"spiritualism\" and therefore are \"antiscience\" and \"quackery,\" respectively. This is a frequent pattern of the criticism of anthro- posophy and anthroposophic medicine, especially by those who appear to be unfamiliar with any systematicassessment that would be required before an unbiased judgment can be made. Anthroposophy and anthroposophic medicine are complex, inevitably provocative, and varied with many components and aspects. An unprepared reading of anthroposophical works will likely lead to a distortedimpression and, when prejudiced, to a supercial, dispar- aging assessment. There are a few basic works that one must carefully read and assimilate before tackling other written or orally transmitted material that was notrevised by Steiner. These basic works will provide the epistemological, philosophical and spiritual-scientic basis, as well as the appropriate technical terms foranthroposophy. These works would include, at the very least, A Theory of Knowledge Implicit in Goethe's World Conception , 1The Philosophy of Freedom ,3The Psychological Foundations of Anthroposophy: It's Standpoint in Relation to the Theory of Knowledge ,4 Theosophy ,16How to Know Higher Worlds,17An Outline of Occult Science,18and additionally for physi- cians, Fundamentals of Therapy: An Extension of the Art of Healing through Spiritual Scientic Knowledge ,23and Rohen's Functional Morphology: The Dynamic Wholeness of the Human Organism .54In addition, Heusser's important and explanatory work, on the relationship betweenanthroposophical spiritual science, Goethean scienceand the natural and social sciences. More clinical refer- ences and textbooks can then be appreciated and under- stood. 60-62 The elds of medicine and science, as well anthropos- ophy and anthroposophic medicine, are all inherently complex and require years of study and training to com-petently understand them. What distinguishes anthro- posophy and anthroposophic medicine from the other elds is the essential necessity of learning to think innon-habitual ways and work one's way to a new viewand understanding of the human being and the world. Furthermore, many critics seem to have a limited notion of what spiritual knowledge and a spiritual14 Global Advances in Health and Medicine194,195,313path means in the modern, anthroposophical context. It certainly does not mean some type of religion or adher- ing to a set of religious views. It means an acknowledge- ment that there are forces or elements at work in humansand nature that are beyond our current natural scienticmethods and technology. We can experience these ele- ments directly in ourselves by self-observation and also infer or deduce them from a more open way of perceiv-ing nature as noted in Table 3 above. Having a spirituallife that can inform the practice of medicine means dis- tinguishing the essential from the non-essential, paying attention to the inner life, embarking on a path of self-observation and self-development, practicing medita-tion, and cultivating various moral virtues that improve one's overall character. 17,21These characteristics of anthroposophic medicine are surely something to be wel-comed within medical practice. 2. Anthroposophic medicine appears to depart from fun- damental (naturalistic, materialistic and mechanical)principles of physiology and biology. Examples include the view that the heart does not pump blood through the whole extensive circulation, but insteadthe blood propels itself; and also, the view that the working brain does not directly cause consciousness. The Heart and Circulation As demonstrated in the above view of the human being (Table 3), anthroposophic medicine does signicantlydepart from the current core tenets of cardiovascular physiology and popular opinion that views the heart as a pressure-propulsion pump which must push the bloodthrough a system of vessels. However, there are impor- tant counter considerations. The total length of blood vessels has been estimated to be /C24100,000 km or /C2460,000 miles. Blood is about 5 times more viscous than water and the red blood cells ( /C2440% of the com- position of blood) are larger than the diameter of the capillaries and must \"squeeze\" through the narrowcapillaries, offering incredible resistance to blood flow.In addition to these unfavorable factors there are others working against a presumption of propelled blood flow by the heart. The heart's muscular anatomy resists dis-tension, has extensive endocardial trabeculations and a steep angle of the outflow tract that mean further unfa- vorable factors for a pressure-propulsion pump. Thesewell-known facts mean that the heart has a very formi- dable task as a pump that dees reason and imagination. Based on a systematic research of circulation models, Branko Furst, M.D., professor of anesthesiology, AlbanyMedical College, Albany, New York, USA, found thatthis old pressure-propulsion paradigm no longer stands up to the rigor of scientic evidence. 196-200A comprehen- sive review of the literature explored in his 2014monograph (second edition in 2020), The Heart and Circulation: An Integrative Model,201and later summa- rized in a review article,197demonstrate that numerous phenomena, ranging from basic cardiovascular physiolo-gy to embryology, comparative anatomy and clinical medicine, contradict the conventional pressure- propulsion model. These anomalous ndings call for areappraisal of the mechanistic, solely physicalist view of the cardiovascular system that is so deeply ingrained in the collective scientic, medical, and popular psyche. Furst proposes a phenomenon-based, biological model of the circulation where the beginning source of blood movement originates at the circulatory periphery,in the domain of the microcirculation, with increasing volume of blood flow in the venous vasculature. The heart, then, functions largely as an organ of restraint,rhythmically interrupting the flow of blood. In this more holistic model, the diastolic lling, i.e., the flow- restraining function of the heart, is equally as importantas the pressure generation and systolic ejection of blood. 197,201-203 Further evidence in support of this anthroposophical view is recent research in embryonic cardiovascular physiology that documents vigorous circulation of blood prior to the development of functional heart values204(this and related ndings are summarized in Chaps. 1-10 of Furst's monograph).201This primary, autonomous blood flow is inextricably linked withtissue demands and organ/tissue autoregula- tion. aortic occlusion experiments (Chap. 18) that convinc-ingly show that cardiac output and ventricular lling pressure increase without any increase in contractile power by the heart. Furthermore, proximal aortic con-striction will lead to a low distal aortic (mea- sured at 20 mmHg) while the proximal aortic pressures remain close to normal. It is difcult to see how such alow pressure could account for the movement of the blood by pressure-propulsion distally andmaintenance of relatively normal proximal aortic pressures. The observed cardiovascular physiology and hemody- namics, as well as theoretical considerations in response to exercise provide further strong evidence against the predictive and explanatory power of the dominant and simplied cardiocentric pressure-propulsion view of blood flow (Chap.17). On the contrary, the scientic evi-dence supports the view that peripheral circulation and tissue demands are at least a dominant and signicant factor in blood flow and cardiovascular hemodynamics.The concept of a skeletal muscle pump has been pro- posed to further add a source of blood flow, since it is especially needed to explain very high cardiac output intrained athletes. However, this concept lacks rm evi- dentiary support and many experimental ndings do not support it (Chap. 17 and references).Bartelme 15Given the complex, rotational and sequential altered shaping of the chambers-the \"wringing\" motions of the heart-and its inner movements (as well as the bulging and elastic recoil of the great vessels), the heart revealsitself as a complex, contracting-and-relaxing, biological organ with little resemblance to a simple, dual propulsion-pressure pump for both the systemic and pul-monary circulations. Human heart motion can be seenon gated MRI scanning during breath holding 205,206and some of its complex movements are summarized by Baciewicz, et al.,207and Nakatani.208The heart's special twisting contraction, and the arterial contractive recoil, may thus add auxiliary-but not a primary-sources of blood flow.201 The above brief summary can provide the reader with a view of heart function and circulation consistent with the evidence. Details of all potential sources bloodmovement will still need to be worked out. However, the big picture is clear. As repeatedly emphasized by Steiner, 209-213the blood has recognized autonomous movement and that this autonomous blood flow actually induces heart movement. Although this picture may seem radical-and not even accepted by everyone inanthroposophic medicine-it ts all the comprehensive ndings of science and harmonizes well with anthropo- sophic medicine's fourfold view of the human being(Table 3). Accepting Steiner and Furst's ndings would be mean a denite paradigm shift in cardiovascular physiology.Thomas Kuhn, in his The Structure of Scientic Revolutions 214clearly documents how the old guard in science defensively reacts to new revolutionary ideas that challenge the old paradigm, despite the accumulatingevidence, and the persistent experimental anomalies that are otherwise difcult to explain. The Brain and Consciousness Similarly, there are claims that Steiner's descriptions of how the internal organs, such as the brain, function in the human organism don't correspond to what is found in medical textbooks, and hence, must be unscientic.This is wrong-headed to say the least. Anthroposophic medicine adds, from an another, exact spiritual-scientic point of view, how the organs function and interact. Thisviewpoint and knowledge add something new to what medical science teaches on a material level. In principle, there is no fundamental contradiction between theresults of science and anthroposophy. Certainly, what is taught and learned in medical schools and biomedical science would need to be reframed into a larger perspec-tive and to take into account-comprehensively-what sci-entic research currently documents. This is what both Heusser's book, Anthroposophy and Science 65and Furst's book, The Heart and Circulation201have done.The current view of brain and nerve function that neuroscience suggests is based on a materialistically ori- ented understanding. There are afferent inputs and effer- ent outputs from only sense-based neurophysiologicaland neurochemical processes. In such an understanding, features and entities such as soul and spirit are difcult to accommodate. Consciousness, mind and other non-material inner experiences that we have appear only to be illusions. Only brain and nerve processes that can be perceived and measured are considered real. This seem-ingly compelling view has permeated medicine and much of modern culture. However, as Steiner points out in his book, Riddles of the Soul , 22the metabolic and rhythmic processes of electrical activity perceived by neuroscience are only traces (like \"footprints\") of the true nerve/brain activity that cannot be perceived with the senses andphysical instruments, but can be deduced by exclusion of other possibilities, or seen with higher cognition. Nervous tissue only allows a necessary, but not suf-cient, physical mirroring process (the making of \"footprints\") from which real, nonmaterial psychospiri- tual activity can come to conscious awareness. 3,22While it is certainly true that brain/nerve activity accurately reflects or represents our inner experience, voluntary movements, and states of consciousness, this electricalactivity alone cannot produce these states of meaningful, conscious experience. Articial neuroelectrical stimula- tion experiments can only bring about fragmentary,involuntary sensations, movements and experiences that are always perceived as being imposed by the exper- imenter and not syntonic with, nor initiated by, the sub-ject's self (Seigward-M Elsas, M.D., personal communication). This view of brain and nerve function doesn't deny the ndings of neuroscience, but only the materialistic (and ideological) interpretation that our sense of self and consciousness are only epiphenomena from a brainlocked within the head with only a few sensory portals to the outside (and inside). In addition, two recent papers discuss how the brain can be viewed as anorgan that mediates consciousness, but does not cause it or produce it\u2014consistent with Steiner's view. 215,216 There is no need to accept the exclusive naturalistic ide- ology of scientic materialism in neuroscience in order to be truly scientic and consistent with allthe results. 3. Anthroposophy, and hence, anthroposophic medicine, has strange \"notions\" about karma and reincarnation and these ideas can negatively impact on illness andmedical treatment. These claims are misleading, and the critics only con- veniently emphasize certain aspects of anthroposophy and often take them out of context. A more thorough reading of Steiner's karma and reincarnation works,16 Global Advances in Health and Medicinesources of bloodalong with his medical lectures, will clearly show the emergence of a more complete and nuanced view. This broader context of the human being's nature and expe- rience helps the physician approach the ill person withthe right background and context. While a past life and karma may give a person a predisposition for a certain illness, it most certainly does not follow that one shouldnot interfere in the person's \"legitimate\" karma. The physician's obligation is to treat the ill person appropri- ately, accompany and support the patient on their heal-ing journey, whether acute or chronic, and address a fourfold healing to strengthen the patient further. Focusing largely on the physical body is often notenough to understand and treat the whole patient. Currently, biomedicine has been helped with addi- tional insights and options from psychosocial medicine,spirituality and meditation. This has allowed conven- tional and integrative physicians (and other practi- tioners) to provide better, more relevant care topatients. However valuable and necessary these approaches undoubtedly are for good medical care, anthroposophic medicine boldly goes much farther byusing individualized, multiple and unique therapeutic modalities that can more directly, dynamically and con- cretely focus on the integrated fourfold human compo-sition as outlined in Table 3. Beyond potentially helpful psychotherapeutic, meditative and spiritual counseling approaches, when it comes to medical treatment, theconventional physician's toolbox has only limited phar- maceutical drugs and other non-medical options. Given the development and expansion of integrative medicine,some patients are signaling their desire for more options besides what conventional medicine provides. Anthroposophic medicine provides many expandedapproaches to manage complex chronic disease. Even if anthroposophic physicians and therapists do not have the legitimate capacity to accurately look at apatient's past life and karma, but that doesn't mean they cannot help the ill patient in their current illness. In addition, an individual person can always embark on aspiritual, moral and meditative path, or live a hygienic lifestyle and assimilate their life lessons to further their development, and thereby fulll some of their karma inother ways besides an illness or accident. 217,218 4. Anthroposophic medicine is \"anti-vaccine\" and is contributing to outbreaks of preventable diseases, like pertussis, measles and influenza. This claim doesn't characterize anthroposophic med- icine's broad view. Again, critics just take out a few excerpts and examples and make blanket statements.Individual anthroposophic physicians, just as conven- tional physicians and other practitioners, have various personal opinions about the utility of vaccinations.Some vaccinate according to ofcial recommendations while others are more selective. The recent and ofcial 2019 joint statement of the international center of anthroposophic medicine, the Medical Section of theGoetheanum, and the International Federation of Anthroposophic Medical Associations (IVAA) clearly state the value of vaccines, and that together withhealth education, hygiene and adequate nutrition, they have contributed to global health and the prevention of many infectious diseases, including life-threateningones. 219The ofcial statement also says anthroposophic medicine is not anti-vaccine and does not support anti- vaccine movements (see Supplement S3). Steiner was largely, although not exclusively, con- cerned with the spiritual and karmic sources and conse- quences of illness217,218and advocated for enlighten child rearing practices, the use of non-suppressive, non-symptomatic anthroposophic medicine62and a healthy, balancing education such as in Waldorf/Steiner schools where the child's development and changing consciousness is addressed in the pedago- gy. 178-181Some feel that anthroposophic medicine may not have much directly to say about the current modern vaccination schedule and vaccines (this is a point of contention). Inside and outside of anthroposophic medicine, it is important for physicians to critically look at the vaccine literature, public health ofcials' statements and the rel-evant science. This has led many physicians, from vari- ous disciplines, specialties and medical systems, critically questioning the safety and effectiveness of whole nation-al vaccination schedules well as of individual vaccines. The topic of individual vaccines and vaccinations is com- plex and goes beyond the scope of this review. However,some of the potentially relevant science and perspectives that has led some physicians to be critical of current vaccination schedule and of individual vaccines will bereviewed. Steiner, anthroposophic physicians and others 220 have the counter-cultural appreciation that benign, childhood febrile illnesses have an actual benet for the child in their physical, spiritual and immune devel- opment, resulting in healthier interactions between thebody, soul and spirit. One must look at the illness and possible purpose more deeply and in a wider context. With current symptomatic medical-therapeuticapproaches this benecial aspect of an acute febrile ill- ness can't be recognized, is ignored, and the phenome- non's existence denied. 60,62-64The current medical and popular culture also thinks that illness is always bad and must be eradicated or prevented. From an anthroposo- phic point of view, the illness must of course be treatedappropriately, but benecial symptoms should not be suppressed just because someone is uncomfortable. Through warm and loving home care and supportive,Bartelme 17enlightened thatto critic- ally question have es andas well asproper remedies, the illness can resolve appropriately, complications can often be prevented, and healing accomplished for the patient with the goal of even improved and strengthen health. Furthermore, there is good epidemiological evidence that many febrile childhood illnesses can help prevent serious chronic disease later in adult life. These studiesindicate that cancer 221-223and mortality from cardiovas- cular disease224are less frequent in adults with history of childhood illnesses such as mumps and measles.Residual confounders in these studies cannot be ruled out, as in any epidemiological research. However, these studies point to an interesting and valuable hypothesisand are consistent with the anthroposophic view that both acute febrile childhood illnesses and fever in gener- al can be benecial. 60,62,225 As noted above, an anthroposophic lifestyle that involves selective vaccinations, restricted use of antipy- retics and antibiotics, and a higher incidence of child-hood febrile illnesses can lead to less atopy, 167,168,171-175 which has been on the increase over the last severaldecades. While vaccines can offer protection against a vacci- nated illness, it cannot provide the broad, febrile immune response of childhood acute febrile illnesses.Fever is part of this benecial systemic immune- inflammatory response that has selective advantage to the host against common pathogens, 225-229and sup- pressing a fever has detrimental effects.230Because anti- gens used in vaccines are generally weak in their immunological effects and duration, they require notonly adjuvant metals (especially aluminum salts) and various chemical additives and emulsiers to boost their immunogenicity, but also require several boosters(at least 2 to 3, and sometimes much more) to get a limited, semi-protective immune response. Despite this, there are still primary and secondary vaccine failures.This is widely known to be true in medicine for pertus- sis, 231-237and measles,238-246mumps247-251and less so for varicella.252-255However, generally only one episode of a childhood febrile illness in healthy individuals leads, tolifetime , broad immunity.238,252-257(Periodic exposure and subclinical boosting of the immune system may benecessary.) The natural childhood febrile illness appears to protect against atypical and severe disease presenta- tions in adolescent and young adults that were seen his-torically after only one dose of measles and varicella vaccinations and before the second booster dose was added. 238,258 Physicians critical of some individual vaccines and the current vaccination schedule are concerned about poten- tial acute and chronic safety and effectivenessissues. 106,220,259-269In this context, informed consent becomes ethically important. Mandatory vaccinations infringe on this fundamental right of a patient, parentor legal guardian, and ignore safety concerns and the inadequate science to support long-term safety and effec- tiveness. Many anthroposophic physicians respect this right of patients, believe in proper informed consent asa standard of care and do not engage in coercion of the patient or parent/legal guardian. 270 Many childhood febrile illnesses (e.g., roseola, mea- sles, chicken pox) are for the most part benign with low risk of complications in healthy, well-nourished chil- dren.106,238,271,272Most physicians and scientists have forgotten previously well-known and documented facts about the low mortality of endemic childhood measles in the US and UK.273-276Two similar UK studies, in 1964277and 1978,278on notied measles cases reported much higher rates of complications, but without suf- cient details of evaluation methods. The differencebetween these results may be due to the changing path- ogenicity of wild measles virus, 238differences in collec- tion and attribution of symptoms and complications, orboth. Some illnesses like pertussis, tetanus, and polio are very difcult to treat and may require repeated vaccina-tions to get immunity, but many currently used vaccines don't offer sufcient protection from contagion and transmission of these illnesses. 245These poorly or sub- optimately protective vaccines against contagion include the injectable inactivated polio vaccine, acellular pertus- sis vaccine, Haemophilus influ- enzae type b vaccine (Hib; not protective against current non-type b strains that have emerged since the introduc- tion of the Hib vaccine), and measles and mumps in the MMR. 245Approximately 5% of children (range 2-12%238,239) seem to have persistent and low immunogenicity (vaccine failures) to the MMR.Furthermore, tetanus is not a contagious disease, but gives personal protection to a person exposed to wounds contaminated with Clostridium tetani . Many pro-mandatory vaccine physicians and legislators advo- cate for the benet of vaccines to eliminate vaccinated diseases but seem unaware of the relevant science thatmakes total protection and elimination unlikely and that there are no documented long-term safety of vaccines by proper scientic standards. 220,257,259,265,279-285 Currently there is an unjustied fear in the general public, public health ofcials, medical authorities and the media about measles and chicken pox that doesn'tcorrespond to the forgotten facts of these largely benign illnesses in childhood. 238,247,271-276The low risk of deaths from measles and chicken pox in developed coun-tries can probably further be reduced with proper treat- ment, although this is as yet unproven. Of course, pharmaceutical vaccine companies and the Center forDisease Control and Prevention (CDC) (which is heavily dependent on funds from pharmaceutical giants and is nancially invested in distributing vaccines) gain a18 Global Advances in Health and Medicineo- A natural, cstrengthened A naturally-acquired, childhood febrile illness appearstremendous amount and benet from the fear and lack of knowledge.106,220,279 In addition, it should be noted that influenza is also a largely benign illness in truly healthy individuals, and the risk of contracting influenza is low. The CDC statisticson death attributed to influenza are biased and exagger-ated. 279-282The yearly effectiveness of the inactivated influenza vaccine also appears to be overstated by theCDC and certainly varies depending on the age groupand risk factors. 279-282The CDC's tracking system and attribution of influenza, as well as their exaggeratedclaims, are not supported by unbiased, independent,non-industry-funded and rigorous assessments. A summary of the scientic literature, often ignored or downplayed by public health ofcials (CDC andFDA), vaccine manufacturers and some vaccinologists,reveals several disturbing safety concerns. First, the vastmajority of the pre-licensure RCTs have been done with-out an inert placebo. Most often, another vaccine withan aluminum adjuvant or the adjuvant in the studiedvaccine is substituted for a true placebo. 220,259,261,286It becomes difcult to truly assess the safety of the vaccinesince the vaccine adjuvant has not been independentlyand scientically studied for its acute and long-termsafety or toxicity apart from the vaccine. Sometimes asmall true placebo arm is embedded in a larger adjuvant-\"placebo\" arm that subsequently hides disturbing safetysignals. Current FDA policy allows \"biologics\" to betested without a true placebo-controlled RCT becauseof the assumption that the vaccine adjuvant componentsare believed to be inherently safe but without any rigor-ous demonstration of the evidence for thisbelief. 106,220,254,259-265 Second, many of the of RCTs and epidemiological studies showing no signicant adverse event ratesbetween the vaccines and non-inert placebo arm usevery short observations periods of between 3,7, 30 or60 days. 220In addition, the judgment of what constitutes a vaccine-related adverse event is often left to be done by biased researchers and not to an independent team or committee.220,286Some conditions such as postural orthostatic hypotension-tachycardia syndrome and syn-dromes of autoimmunity are difcult to diagnose andmay take years to develop and recognize by a physicianor researcher. 220,268,269,286 Third, most studies and meta-analyses use dened diagnostic categories and not individual or clusters ofsymptoms for detecting adverse vaccine reactions. Formany syndromes or diagnoses of chronic conditions itmay take months or years to develop. 220,269,271,286 Furthermore, many safety studies use inadequate passivesurveillance systems, such as the Vaccine Adverse EventsReporting System (VAERS), which are estimated to cap-ture only 1-10% of vaccine reactions. 220,287Fourth, modern toxicological studies have shown the potential neurotoxic effects of aluminum adjuvants andethyl mercury preservative in vaccines at current paren-teral doses, and that FDA and CDC's statements on thesafety of current aluminum adjuvants and ethyl mercurydoses does not correspond to current knowledge. 259- 264,267,286,288There is evidence that an altered vaccina- tion schedule with less burden of aluminum-containing vaccines will considerably lower toxic levels of aluminumin chidren. 289 Fifth, it is currently reported that vaccine failure (pri- mary or secondary) for pertussis (DTaP, TdaP) vaccines, influenza vaccines and the MMR vaccine is a real prob- lem, leading to infections of these vaccinated diseases,even when fully vaccinated and documented to be immu-nized. 231-251,280-285 Sixth, current epidemiological studies purporting to show the safety of vaccines and the current vaccination schedule often appear to have flawed methodolo- gy,220,259,283,284,290are notoriously subject to bias,259 selective publishing,291poorly designed methods/proto- col,106,280-286and confounding,259,292and thus, not a very good level of evidence to dismiss current safetyconcerns outlined above. It would seem prudent to more openly and forthright- ly discuss these disturbing and unflattering aspects ofvaccines and the vaccination schedule and to include asummary of them in informed consent discussions.Perhaps the assumptions and rationale behind currentvaccines and vaccination need to be rethought. 293In an attempt to mitigate and overcome some of vaccines'negative adverse effects, anthroposophic supplementsand remedies are recommended. 62,64 The Institute of Medicine's initial 2001294recommen- dation to research the possible effects of multiple dosesof various vaccines in the current schedule might have onpediatric neurodevelopmental disorders has beenignored and never done. 285A linear regression analysis showing a positive correlation between number of vac-cines doses and infant mortality rate should be spurringfurther investigation. 295There is credible initial evidence from a cohort study that a delayed vaccination schedule and reducing the total number of vaccinations lowers the odds ratio risk for developmental delay, asthma, otitismedia and perhaps others. 296,297More research along all these lines is clearly needed.298 Furthermore, the vaccine industry lacks sufcient oversight over the manufacturing of vaccines.106 Disturbing reports of foreign genetic material,299,300for- eign proteins,301non-aluminum metallic particles302and possible retroviruses303in current vaccines, as well as scientic allegations of fraud against a largepharmaceutical-vaccine manufacturer 304should be concerning.Bartelme 19do in from multipleAll this is not to blanketly suggest a complete anti- vaccine stance. As noted above, anthroposophic medi- cine as a discipline does not support this. The evidence and ndings (much more is available106,259) so far do support a more circumspect and critical view of some vaccines and the current vaccination schedule, as well as support a call for proper safety studies and improved,safer vaccines. 5. There is little or \"no\" evidence on the effectiveness of anthroposophic medicine. Most critics who say this are embedded in the cur- rent monoparadigmatic view of scientic materialism and molecular reductionism and stay rigid in their habitual thoughts and make blanket, biased statementsthat are at variance with the current research. In addi- tion, it is clear that the critics have not kept up with the evolving evidence base of anthroposophic medicine.This review has given a sense of its current research base. There is published, documented evidence of effec- tiveness for anthroposophic mistletoepreparations, obstetric preparations and common pri- mary care treatments 55,56,119,142,144,158,159,164,185,187-193 as well as for other medical and non-medical treat- ments.160,162,167-177Readers are urged to look at the references for further details and topics. There are a number of reasons why the current research evidence base is so thin. Anthroposophic med- icine is still young, comparatively speaking, and is so complex and expansive that it will require considerableresearch and support to assess everything in anthropo- sophic medicine. Yet, it is a very safe form of medicine that is practiced by licensed medical physicians. 131Only in the last 2 decades has there been enough qualied researchers to embark on an appropriate and compre- hensive research program. However, to date, there hasbeen little to no institutional, industry or governmental support. In addition, many attempted European RCTs in the past had to be canceled because of a lack ofpatient recruitment. In Europe, many patients prefer active anthroposophic treatment and refuse to be ran- domized in a placebo or conventional medical group(Renatus Ziegler, Ph.D. and Peter Heusser, M.D, per- sonal communication). Despite these obstacles, research has been done and is ongoing. 51,57,126A whole systems- based research strategy for anthroposophic medicine has recently been proposed and published.305 6. Critics charge anthroposophic physicians with medi- cal neglect, improper diagnosis, and inappropriate and failed treatment. Looking at certain purported cited cases, it seems clear that individual anthroposophic physicians did notdo a proper medical workup, nor have an accurate diag- nosis, and embarked on an inappropriate and failed treatment. However, the critics conveniently ignore that this is also unfortunately very true for convention-ally trained physicians. Most practicing physicians know that a general problem in medicine is that clinicians make errors and individual practitioners, unfortunately,do not always follow standard medical procedures. Proper education and training on mitigating errors are needed in all elds of medicine, whether conventional orintegrative. What's more, anthroposophic physicians are to keep, so to speak, one foot in conventional medicine and onefoot in anthroposophic medicine to really practice the discipline. It behooves all physicians, whether conven- tional, integrative or anthroposophical to keep abreastof medical advances to improve their care of patients. In addition, anthroposophic physicians need to continue a path of self-development and ever deepening of theknowledge of anthroposophy and anthroposophic med- icine to improve their perceptions and insights for the benet of their patients. The exaggerated claim that useof anthroposophic medicine may cause harm if it is a substitute for standard conventional care is empty and without impact, since anthroposophic physicians aretrained and expected to judge whether one treatment or another is best. In anthroposophic medicine, as in other disciplines and medical systems, there is an aware-ness and an appreciation that there is often more than one way to treat an ill patient and get good or even superior outcomes. The question then becomes whatmethod of treatment best serves the patient in both the short-term and -especially-in the long-term? A comparative, observational, cross-sectional study between primary care anthroposophic medicine and con- ventional care is relevant here in that it demonstrated that anthroposophic medical patients were more signif-icantly satised with their care and their physicians. 77 They were more likely to feel their physicians listenedto them, spent more time with them, involved them morein medical decisions about their care and were more made to feel at ease to tell about their problems. These are all valued clinical attributes of professional, empath-ic physicians. 7. Critics of anthroposophic medicine often clearly express their dismay, irritation and ridicule. They point to what, for them, are fantastic claims and associations made by Steiner and anthroposophists. It is instructive to look at this more deeply. As has been already pointed out, the written comments of criticsand skeptics appear uninformed, selective and derisive in their assessments and quotes of Rudolf Steiner and anthroposophic medicine in general. Unfamiliarity with20 Global Advances in Health and Medicineblanket, makingthe basic and more advanced works in anthroposophy and anthroposophic medicine makes it difcult to make an informed and objective assessment. Even in a cursory reading of selective aspects of anthroposophy and anthroposophic medicine, one encounters unfamiliar ideas and ways of thinking that are quite foreign to current habitual thought patternsand beliefs. A purely intellectual, and materially- oriented way thinking will not help one understand and engage in anthroposophy. With this type ofcommon and habitual thinking, one will only encounter \"bizarre\" ideas and terms, that can be easy to ridicule and difcult to understand. As in any discipline, onewould have to study the fundamental works and learn the technical terms that do not have the same meaning as the current understanding based on natural materialistscience. For Steiner is often talking about processes and specic spiritual forces working in nature, the universe and in human organisms. Like any type of force, phys- ical or spiritual , they cannot be directly perceived with ordinary consciousness; their existence can only be inferred through their effects. This would includeknown physical forces of electricity and magnetism, gravity, strong and weak nuclear forces, and perhaps others. With an extensive cognitive, moral and medita-tive path, the effects of life, soul and spiritual forces can be recognized and understood, and can help bring deeper insights into how and why symptoms are appear-ing in an illness and in functional, pre-illness conditions. In reading anthroposophy, one can be confronted with a great and radical challenge. Critical, but unin-formed readers of Steiner often recoil from the transfor- mation of the mind and soul required to awaken and rise up beyond the frequent and supercial abstractions inour current thinking to a new, more enlivened, intensi- ed, will-engendered thinking that is still objective and crystal-clear, but also is more flexible, quicker and nim-bler in order to grasp living, real, spiritual processes and forces. While it may be difcult to accept, understand and experience anthroposophic medicine, it is becomingincreasingly difcult to dismiss or explain away the expanding positive research and high patient satisfac- tion. And, just like during Copernicus' time there waslittle, if any, superior evidence to support his heliocentric theory (only claims of more beauty and mathematical harmony), at the present time, anthroposophic medicinehas a lot of helpful concepts and insights that are diag- nostically and therapeutically useful, but only has the very modest beginnings of an established researchbase. 51,57,126However, current practice and science of anthroposophic medicine is consistent with much of the founding principles of evidence-based medi-cine 306-308while cognizant of their limitations and legit- imate criticisms (e.g., the need for triangulation of evidence).194,309,310Steiner himself recognized that his approach made in his lectures on medicine are \"among the most difcult to comprehend of all lectures presenting the anthroposoph- ical point view.\"25Nevertheless, he regarded this dif- culty, in view of the objective pursued to reformulate and expand conventional medicine to include insights from spiritual science to be something that \"can hardlybe otherwise.\" 25 More importantly, Steiner himself repeatedly stated to his medical and scientic audiences his request thatthey provide the necessary verications, elaborations, and possible falsications of his mostly aphoristic teach- with empirical, natural scientic methods. In his1917 book, Riddles of the Soul , 22Steiner puts forth the view that natural science and the spiritual science of anthroposophy should be complementary to each otherand contribute equally to the whole view of a subject that people truly seek. In his rst medical course for physicians, Spiritual Science and Medicine , he tells his audience that what he is presenting from multiple points of view is \"some guiding thoughts, \"a rough guid- ing thread\", and \"a preliminary outline\" to be used as a\"regulatory principle\" that must be veried to be valu- able and worked out with the use of natural scientic empirical methods. 25,65The current research agenda of anthroposophic medicine is doing just that; providing some verications and elaborations of aspects of anthro- posophic medicine but without the historically-xated,reductionistic mindset of many skeptics and critics. One should be aware that anthroposophy (and anthroposophic medicine) is not the only \"philosophic\"or scientic view and medical system critical of the cur- rent world view of scientic materialism and biomedi- cine. In 2018 The Scientic and Medical Networkpublished online, the Galileo Commission Report, Science Beyond A Materialist World View: Towards A Post-Materialist Science . refutation (through argumen- and empirical evidence) of the current scientic materialist paradigm/world view as necessary and suf- cient for all legitimate knowledge and values, is in much agreement with what anthroposophy and anthroposo- phic medicine has been advocating since the 1880 s andthe 1920s, respectively. Neither anthroposophy nor the Scientic and Medical Network is against the legitimate nature, heuristic methods, and approach and goals ofnatural science; both argue against the much restrictive, dogmatic and exclusive claims of scientic materialism as the only approach and legitimate way to do science.There is very much to gain by extending and comple- menting current natural science. Anthroposophic medi- cine is one rational and fruitful way to do this. When one experiences the insight and arguments put forth by anthroposophy and the Galileo Commission, one can agree with Larry Dossey, M.D.: \"In theBartelme 21, meanings as in manyand view as one necessaryfuture, if we have one, our descendants will surely look with astonishment on the hallmark of our age: how wewere duped by materialism, how our most brilliant sci- entists enthusiastically used their minds to prove that minds do not exist, how they employed their conscious-ness in the task of proving that no one is truly conscious.A condition for our species' survival is, rst and fore-most, to survive the dehumanizing, paralyzing, suicidal scourge of materialism. The Galileo Commission Report is a powerful move in this direction.\" 74 The patterns and sources of criticism of Steiner, anthroposophy and anthroposophic medicine come from entrenched ideas of scientic naturalism with itsone-sided material reductionism. There arephilosophical-epistemological reasons and an evidencebase that argue against this world view, but it would require considerable openness and rethinking to gain the necessary insight. Skeptics and critics seem to want \"proofs\" on their own limited (material) terms, but as Goethe once said, \"it's hard to argue with someone who believes the false istrue.\" The \"false belief\" in this case is the one that canaccept as true only materialist, physically-based state- ments that are accepted by current, historically- determined science (the historicity of science). 10,12,74 However much the current and historically-determined modern science is overly materialistic, it is still able tochange, evolve and transform itself to be more suitableto the study of the full human being and its environment.Anthroposophy and anthroposophic medicine are endeavoring to do just that. 51,57,126There is an ongoing commitment by anthroposophic medicine to investigateand research the insights and suggestions of Steiner formedicine by doing appropriate science and to expand theresearch base. As has been previously stated, current anthroposophic medical research already demonstrates positive ndings that can benet conventional medicinein the service of patients. Conclusion It should be clear by now that the scientic status ofanthroposophic medicine is well founded. This is inspite of its seemingly provocative tenets and views, that are not aligned with current scientic naturalistic philosophy/ideology and its physicalist world view.Looking at three ways of viewing what is science andwhat constitutes the scientic method\u2014from epistemol-ogy to Goethean science to modern philosophy of sci- ence\u2014anthroposophic medicine meets the criteria of a science, despite its only modest stage of developmentand results to date. Anthroposophy and anthroposophic medicine are undoubtedly provocative because they forthrightlydiscuss the real, effective and dynamic working ofnon-physical aspects of the human being, including non-physical life processes from the etheric life body, the psychological, internal organ physiology and nerve- sensory processes from the astral body, and the humanspiritual processes from both the conscious spiritual as well as unconscious organic processes flowing from the human \"I\" (Table 3). While certainly the lower-order levels can influence the higher-order ones, anthroposophic medicine reverses the usual \"scientic view\" of a bottom-up approach tolife where physical matter is primary and determines everything. Anthroposophy and cutting-edge science show in various ways how the higher-order levels orga-nize, shape and determine to a considerable extent what appears to be the lower-ordered lawfulness and raise it to higher functions of the human organism. It may takea considerable amount of time until this new, anthroposophic-scientic view is widely accepted, but much of current science points in this direction; the nd-ings can't adequately be explained by current natural scientic understanding and thinking. In addition, patients and the public want medicine to go in the direction towards holism and integration, and away from the one-sided technical and materially- oriented slant of current medicine. A truly comprehen-sive understanding of medicine is needed, which will entail more holistic forms of treatment. These holistic forms of treatment need to account for the physical,biological-organismic, psychological, and spiritual aspects of the human being in health and illness. This is the approach that has been taken by anthroposophicmedicine. All the evidence published, as well as long clinical experience, points to the excellent safety of anthroposo-phic medical products, especially when compared to FDA-approved and widely-prescribed pharmaceuticals. Even parenteral anthroposophic remedies are very safe,when used appropriately and knowledgably. Since these anthroposophic medicines have real effects, appropriate training is necessary to maintain an excellent safetyprole. Increasingly there is published evidence that anthro- posophic medicine\u2014its remedies and other modalities\u2014can be efcacious. When anthroposophic medicine is studied as a whole system approach with the use of var- ious modalities in a real-world setting (outpatient orinpatient) there is good initial evidence of its cost- effectiveness with a high degree of patient satisfaction. Most criticisms of anthroposophy and anthroposo- phic medicine appear to be largely based on a lack of true familiarity with them and the supporting literature. Much of this criticism reflects an inability or an unwill-ingness to think unconventionally but still rationally. The critics then react with poorly conceived critiques that demonstrate prejudice, superciality, and22 Global Advances in Health and Medicinesee(ignoring the historicity of sciencesometimes even abusive derision. Of course, skeptics and critics sense that anthroposophic medicine presents a radical transformation in thinking and a world view at odds with scientic materialism which is so entrenched inscience, biomedicine, modern culture and current socio- economic practices. Only an appropriate and rigorous evaluation of the literature can lead to a more objectiveassessment of anthroposophic medicine. Due to its comprehensive and holistic nature, anthro- posophic medicine has so much to offer modern conven-tional medicine. First, it stands within the eld of medicine and respects its scientic basis. It acknowledges the valuable framework of conventional modern medi-cine and when appropriate its goals for empirically- based treatment. Second, it can help overcome the shackles of scientic materialism that so many peoplepainfully feel violates their own sense of themselves. It offers a transformative vision of the human being and of nature that can overcome a sense of alienation from ourtrue being and from nature. Third, it can rationally and empirically expand current therapeutic options that are still denitely helpful, but at the same time generallylimiting and frequently problematic. Fourth, anthropo- sophic medicine is a form of medical practice that stim- ulates and calls for self-development of the physicianand, by its very approach, provides a higher degree of patient satisfaction. Fifth, the integrative and scientic view of anthropo- sophic medicine can provide a rational and empirical basis to unite many of the various aspects and modalities of integrative medicine that to date largely constitute adisparate aggregation of modalities and theories lacking an overall scientic, psychological and human coher- ence. In this review only allusions to this aspect weremade, but Heusser's book, Anthroposophy and Science, goes into this in detail. 65 Sixth, anthroposophic medicine is only one important aspect of the spiritual-scientic world view, philosophy and practical wisdom that flows out of anthroposophy. Given the overall impetus of anthroposophy and itspotential philosophical and practical applications that extend well beyond medicine and health, it can become clear that anthroposophy is potentially a potent, scien-tic, human and spiritual counterweight to the negative aspects of modernity's materialism. It therefore needs to be recognized as an important, truly comprehensive, andsocietal healing force . This is one of the deep intentions of Rudolf Steiner. 311,312 Seventh, and last, anthroposophic medicine offers new avenues for research, some of which that are more qualitative, but still scientic, and which can stand side by side with quantitative natural science, and with theadded potential to further a deeper understanding of human beings and about their multilevel relationship with nature.Acknowledgments The author would like to thank several reviewers and their contributions to a better document: James Dyson, M.D.,Branko Furst, M.D., Helmut Kiene, M.D., Gunver M.D., Peter Heusser, M.D., Stephen Johnson, D.O., Alicia M.D., Mary Anne Perrone, John Takacs,D.O., Steven Usher, Ph.D., and Sara Warber, M.D. In addi-tion, two organizations need to be acknowledged.

The author would like to acknowledge and thank Helmut Kiene, M.D., for pointing me to this information. As hehas pointed out, during early systole (ventricular contrac- tion) become larger (\"splayed open\") and rapidly begin lling with pulsating blood while at the same timethe A-V valves (mitral and tricuspid valves) are beingpulled downward toward the ventricles because of thecontracted smaller heart. With this movement comes acolumn of blood in the atria towards the ventricles, before the A-V valves open. (There is also a bulging of the A-V values in the opposite direction because of thesystolic contraction of the ventricles). Correspondingly inearly systole, the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonaryvalves) are also being pulled downward for the samereason. This results in a column of blood in each ventricle moving upward toward the aorta and pulmonary arterial trunk, respectively, before the semilunar valves open andthe blood is ejected. The blood movement in the arteriesand pulmonary veins is seen to be pulsatile and spiralnature, mirroring the contracting heart. In the cardiacchambers themselves there is also vigorous mixing of blood, forming vortices. 207. Baciewiez FA, Penney W, Marinelli WA, Marinelli R.
