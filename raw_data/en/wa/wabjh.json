Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago conducted a community health needs assessment (CHNA) in 2019 to better understand the health of children and adolescents in Chicago, and to guide Lurie Children's continuing efforts to improve the health and well-being of youth, consistent with our longstanding mission. To minimize duplicative data requests and analyses, and to maximize the potential for hospitals in Chicago and Cook County conducting CHNAs to work together on shared priorities, Lurie Children's participated in the development of the Alliance for Health Equity's Collaborative CHNA. This effort, led by the Illinois Public Health Institute (IPHI) , involved 37 hospitals, six local health departments, and nearly 100 community -based organizations. Lurie Children's extracted key findings from the Collaborative CHN A specifically related to children and adolescents age 0-19 in Chicago for our CHNA. Lurie Children's supplemented this by conducting, reviewing and analyzing additional primary and secondary data for Chicago youth to develop our CHNA. Based on substantial data review and community input, Lurie Children's identified the following as priority areas for intervention: social determinants of health; access to care; chronic health conditions; mental and behavioral health; and unintentional injury and violence. Key f indings from Lurie Children's CHNA are: Significant health inequities persist in Chicago for youth and affect all priority health areas. The most pervasive health inequities in Chicago are related to race. Social determinants of health, including poverty, education, employment, housing/homelessness and food insecurity substantially contribute to the health status of youth in Chicago, and disproportionally affect youth in neighborhoods with low/very low opportunity. In Chicago, infant mortality rates per 1,000 births ranged from 3.4 for whites to 12.7 for blacks/African Americans . Because of state policy advances in the Medicaid program, only 4 percent of youth in Chicago are uninsured. This progress is significant, but challenges related to access to care , including proximity and quality remain. The prevalence and exacerbation of chronic health conditions, including asthma, complex chronic conditions and obesity, are highly affected by social determinants of health. Approximately 15-20 percent of youth have a serious mental or behavioral health condition and as many as 50 percent do not receive the mental health care they need. There has been progress in the recognition of the longstanding effects of trauma and childhood adversity on long -term health . Recent policy changes in Illinois are helping to move towards more integrated physical and behavioral health services. However, mental and behavioral health services are the top concern for many individuals in low/very low opportunity neighborhoods, driven largely by quality concerns, inadequate reimbursement, stigma and workforce shortages. U nintentional injuries are the leading cause of death and a major cause of emergency department visits among children and adolescents , and infants and adolescents are the age groups with the highest unintentional injury death rates. Although violence occurs in all communities, it disproportionately affects low-income communities of color and especially black/African American boys and young men. In 2017, young black males were 13.7 times more likely to die from a firearm -related homicide than non-black males in Chicago . Significant interconnectedness exists between all the above highlighted key findings. Implementation strategies that reach \"upstream\" to focus on preven tion and underlying causes of health outcomes should be prioritized. |Page 4 Introduction LURIE CHILDREN'S OVERVIEW Mission, Vision, and History Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago (formerly Children's Memorial Hospital) is an Illinois not- for-profit corporation and a charitable organization within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. As one of the top pediatric hospitals in the nation, Lurie Children's delivers the highest quality, family -centered care and high -impact research. Over half of the inpatient care Lurie Children's provides is for children insured by Medicaid. We are the largest pediatric specia lty provider in the region, by volume, with 332 licensed inpatient beds. Figure 1 provides details regarding patient volumes and services. Inpatient expansion plans are underway , which will bring our total inpatient beds to 364 by the end of 2019. We are guided by the belief that all children need to grow up in a protective and nurturing environment where all children are given the opportunity to reach their full potential. Lurie Children's mission is to enhance the health and well-being of all children. We aim to achie ve this through our core pillars: Healthcare delivery for infants, children, adolescents and young adults Research into the prevention, causes and treatment of diseases that affect children E ducation for physicians, nurses and allied health professionals Advocacy for the general well-being of all children Founded in 1882 as the first hospital in Chicago focuse d solely on the care of children , Lurie Children's has grown from an 8-bed cottage home in Lincoln Park to a state -of-the-art pediatric medical center with facilities across Chicago and Illinois. Figure 1. Fiscal year 2018 includes services at our partner locations provided by Lurie Children's physicians |Page 5 Facilities and Locations Lurie Children's main hospital is located in Chicago, Illinois. In addition, we have 13 outpatient services locations, five primary care locations and 16 partner hospitals across Chicago and Illinois, providing greater access to the best pediatric care for all children (Figure 2).

According to U.S. News & World Report , in 2019 Lurie Children's is the top ranked children's hospital in Illinois and the only children's hospital in the state to rank in all 10 featured specialties. In 2019, Lurie Children's ranked in the top 10 hospitals across the nation for cardiology and heart surgery (2nd), urology (5th), gastroenterology and gastrointestinal surgery (8th), and nephrology (10th). Nationally Ranked by U.S. News & World Report in 2019 in 10 Specialties : Pediatric Cardiology & Heart Surgery Pediatric Urology Pediatric Gastroenterology & Gastrointestinal Surgery Pediatric Neurology Orthop aedics Pediatric Cancer Pediatric Nephrology Neonatal Care Pediatric Pulmonary Care Pediatric Diabetes & Endocrine Disorder Lurie Children's has been named a level I pediatric surgery center by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) three times , becoming the first children's hospital in Illinois to earn this status. Lurie C hildren's provid es comprehensive family- centered care. Family service support patients and their families emotionally, mentally and spiritually (Figure 3). An interdisciplinary team of social workers, chaplains, child life specialists and creative arts therapists follows inpatients from diagnosis through discharge. Social workers and chaplains are available 24 hours /day, seven days a week. Activity coordinators and volunteers engage patients and families with fun and creative age- appropriate activities that promote child development. Teachers create individualized educational opportunities so that our patients continue to embrace learning and flourish intellectually. Interpreters ensure cultural- relevant communication with our families who have limited Engli sh language proficiency. RESEARCH - Research at Lurie Children's is conducted through Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute and focus es on improving child health, transforming pediatric medicine and ensuring healthier futures through the understandin g, prevention and investigation of pediatric illnesses and injuries. Established in 1986, our pediatric research institute has more than 200 investigators, 500 staff members and 100 trainees who contribute to 10 growing programs in basic science, translat ional medicine , clinical research Figure 3. Model of comprehensive services and supports for patients and families |Page 7 and community health . We also have interdisciplinary centers of excellence that target specific child health issues and complement our core programs. Designated by Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine as a research center for our central role in the university 's integrated research program , our scientists work in labs, in clinics, at the patient bedside and in the community to unravel the root causes of pediatric and adolescent disease, to understand childhoo d injury and to identify and address factors that precipitate health problems in childhood and over a lifetime. The Manne Research Institute moved to the Louis A. Simpson and Kimberly K. Querrey Biomedical Research Center in June 2019 . This new location, just blocks away from Lurie Children's main hospital and on the campus of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine , house s hundreds of investigators and staff. We continue a robust research enterprise to investigate and addres s the challenges of childhood diseases, including the clinical, genetic, developmental and public health aspects of child health. EDUCATION - As the pediatric teaching facility of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine , Lurie Children's is dedicated to training physicians through our pediatric and pharmacy resident programs and our clinical fellowships in pediatrics, surgery, anesthesia, psychiatry, pathology and medical imaging . In addition, Lurie Children's hosts various training programs for residents from other institutions, medical students, nurses and allied health professionals and cultivates relationships with local high schools and colleges to provide healthcare career internships for aspiring clinicians . ADVOCACY - L urie Children's is dedicated to protecting children by working with collaborators, community leaders and elected and appointed officials to: Ensure that children have coverage and access to needed healthcare, including mental healthcare , through the Medicaid program, the single largest health insurer for children in America Support the training of the next generation of pediatric healthcare workforce through policy and programmatic initiative s including applied internships and mentoring Extend clinical care in to the comm unity through programs that include mental health supports, resiliency trainings, wellness care, safety trainings and health education Protect and strengthen child health and medical research as a priority In early 2017, Lurie Children's Healthy Communiti es (Healthy Communities), a program at Lurie Children's, was created in part to support the Community Health Needs Assessment process and recommendations . Healthy Communities is designed to maximize the positive impact the medical center and its partners have on child health in the community . Healthy Communities leads the Community Health Needs Assessment process to understand the needs of the community, utilize evidence -based practices and create strong partnerships that deepen our reach and effectiveness in every community served. Healthy Communities builds on decades of Lurie Children's experts' successful public health outreach and leads the development, monitoring and evaluation of our Community Health Needs Assessment Implementation Plan with a focus on equity, impact, authentic collaborations and long- term commitment. |Page 8 COLLABORATIVE CHNA OVERVIEW Alliance for Health Equity In addition to development of our own Communit y Health Needs Assessment, Lurie Children's participated in the development of the Collaborative CHNA (allhealthequity .org/projects/2019 -chna -reports) spearheaded by the Alliance for Health Equity, a collaborative of hospitals/health systems working with health departments and regional and community -based organizations to improve health equity, wellness and quality of life across Chicago and Suburban Cook County. The purpose of the Alliance for Health Equity is to improve population and commu nity health by: Promoting health equity Supporting capacity building, shared learning, and connecting local initiatives Addressing social and structural determinants of health Developing broad city and county wide initiatives and creating systems Engaging community partners and working collaboratively with community leaders Developing data systems for population health to support shared impact measurement and community assessment Collaborating on population health policy and advocacy The Alliance for Health Equity was developed so that participating organizations can collaboratively assess community health needs, collectively develop shared implementation plans to address community health needs, more efficiently share resources, and have a greater impact on the large population residing in Cook County. Currently, 37 hospitals, six local health departments including Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) and Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) , and nearly 100 community -based organizat ions are participating (Table 1).

Primary and secondary data from a diverse range of sources were utilized for robust data analysis and to identify community health needs in Chicago and Suburban Cook County. Health inequities and their underlying root causes are highlighted and discussed throughout the assessment. PRIMARY DATA COLLECTION - Primary data for the Collaborative CHNA was collected through four methods: Community input surveys Community resident focus groups and learning map sessions Healthcare and social service provider focus groups Two stakeholder assessments led by partner health departments \u2014Forces of Change Assessment and Health Equity Capacity Assessment IPHI and the CHNA committee took the following steps to develop the survey tool: (1) IPHI drafted a survey based on review of 13 example community input surveys, (2) CHNA committee members from hospitals and health departments provided input, (3) IPHI incorporated revisions from CHNA committee members and the University of Illinois at Chicago Survey Research Laboratory, (4) IPHI made edits based on a health literacy review, (5) IPHI and two member hospitals piloted the survey at three community -based events, and (6) IPHI made final edits to address minor challenges identified at the pilot events. Between Oc tober 2018 and February 2019, Alliance for Health Equity partners collected 5,934 community input surveys from individuals 18 or older living in Chicago and Suburban Cook County. The surveys were available on paper and online and were disseminated in English, Spanish, Chinese, and Polish. The surveys included questions asking respondents about the health status of their communities, community strengths, opportunities for improvement, and priority health needs . Hospitals, community -based organizations, and health departments distributed the surveys with the intention of gaining insight from priority populations that are typically underrepresented in assessment processes. Some of the priority populations were communities of color, immigrants, LGBTQ+ community members, individuals with disabilities, and low-income communities. Between A ugust 2018 and February 2019, IPHI worked with Alliance for Health Equity partners to hold a total of 52 community input sessions (focus groups and learning map sessions) with priority populations such as veterans, individuals living with mental illness, communities of color, older adults, caregivers, teens and young adults, LGBTQ+ community members, adults and teens experiencing hom elessness, families with children, faith communities, adults with disabilities, and children and adults living with chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma. The community input sessions included 31 focus groups conducted by IPHI and 21 learning map sessions led by West Side United (a collaborative of six hospitals , including Lurie Children's , who serve large numbers of patients from Chicago's West side, partnered with community -based organizations and individuals who live and work on the West side) with note -taking by IPHI. In addition to the 52 community input sessions, there were also three focus groups with healthcare and social service providers hosted by Swedish Covenant Hospital, MacNeal Hospital, and South Shore Hospital. Focus group facilitat ors asked participants about the underlying root causes of health issues that they see in their communities and specific strategies for addressing those health needs. |Page 10 The Forces of Change Assessment collects information on the trends, factors, and events that are currently affecting and/or anticipated to affect the public health system in the near future (3-5 years). CDPH led this assessment in partnership with their Partnership for a Healthy Chicago, and CCDPH. Between November 2018 and January 2019, 122 individuals representing 86 organizations in Chicago and Suburban Cook County responded to an online survey. The Health Equity Capacity Assessment was led by CDPH, the Partnership for a Healthy Chicago, CCDPH, and IPHI. CDPH, CCDPH, and the Partnership worked with faculty from DePaul and UIC Schools of Public Health to develop a tool to score the capacity of the public health system to advance healt h equity. The tool consists of five-six questions for each of the 10 Essential Public Health Services relating to five components of health equity: community engagement/involvement, organizational processes, power/influence, structural inequities, and funding. On March 5, 2019, 80 people from across Chicago and Suburban Cook County came together to score how well the system is functioning around health equity and to identify challenges, strengths, and opportunities to move forward. SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS - Epidemiologists from CCDPH and CDPH worked with IPHI and the steering committee to select a common set of indicators based on an adapted version of the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps Model (Figure 4). The C HNA and steering committees also decided to delve further into four key community health issues that surfaced as priority needs in the last CHNA and health department assessments: Behavioral health Food security and food access Community and economic development Housing Secondary data used in the Collaborative CHNA were compiled from a range of sources: Peer -reviewed literature and white papers Existing assessments and plans focused on key topic areas Localized data compiled by several agencies including Chicago Department of Planning and Development, Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning, Housing Authority of Cook County, and state and local police departments Localized data compiled by community -based organizations and academic institutions, including Greater Chicago Food Depository and Voices of Child Health in Chicago Hospitalization and emergency department encounter data provided by Illinois Health and Hospital Association and analyzed by the Conduent Healthy Communities Institute Figure 4. Adapted County Health Rankings and Roadmaps Model |Page 11 Data compiled by state agencies including Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services, Illinois Department of Human Services, Illinois State Board of Education, and Illinois Department of Public Health Data from federal sources including U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey data compiled by Chicago Department of Public Health and Cook County Department of Public Health; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ; Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data accessed through the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care; Health Resources and Services Admin istration; and United States Department of Agriculture Lurie Children's Role Lurie Children's participated in an advisory role as a member of the Alliance for Health Equity Steering Committee. In addition, Lurie Children's participated in and contributed to the Collaborative Community Health Needs Assessment subcommittee, and also to ad hoc work groups focused on data visualizations and copy editing, providing feedback and guidance on various Collaborative CHNA activities (e.g., community engagement, surv ey development and dissemination, and recruiting and facilitating focus group s. Lurie Children's continues to be actively engaged in various workgroups (e.g., community safety, data, food access, housing, policy, trauma- informed care and social determinant s of health), ensuring that the youth -focused perspective is well-represented. LURIE CHILDREN'S CHNA COMMUNITY Service Area Community As a leading pediatric provider, Lurie Children's serves patients and families from every state in the United States and 58 countries across the world. As a pediatric leader in Chicago, the highest volume of patients come from our very own community. Nearly 44 percent of our patients live in the City of Chicago - annually, Lurie Children's provides healthcare services, from primary care to subspecialty care, to over 90,000 Chicagoans 0-19 years old. For this reason and the fact that Lurie Children's is located in the City of Chicago, we define our service area community for the purposes of the assessment as the city of Chicago (Figure 5). Over 97 percent of patients are 0-19 years old, and therefore our priority population for the CHNA is infants, children and adolescents 0-19 years old. Data are presented for this geography and population, where available, and noted whe n data fall outside of our service area and priority population. Data was included in some instances for adult populations, when pediatric data was not available and where family/ community context impacts child health. Methodology and Data Sources In addition to Lurie Children's participation in the Alliance for Health Equity's Collaborative CHNA, Lurie Children's conducted a concurrent needs assessment between March 2018 and July 2019 with a focus on our service area and priority population. This assessment was conducted by Lurie Children's Healthy Communities, in partnership with Lurie Children's Department of Data Analytics and Reporting. Two advisory groups provided oversight and guidance on the CHNA : Lurie Children's Healthy Communities Internal Advisory Committee and Lurie Children's Healthy Communities External Advisory Committee (members listed in Appendix A ). We also asked these committees to review and provide feedback on drafts of the Alliance for Health Equity's Collaborative CHNA and Lurie Children's CHNA. See Appendix B for a summary of key meeting dates and Lurie Children's participation in the Alliance for Health Equity Collaborative CHNA planning and implementation. Relevant d ata and content from the Collaborative CHNA are integrated into Lurie Children's 2019 CHNA. Additional primary and secondary data were collected and analyzed. |Page 12 Figure 5.

Note: The ranges of all gradient maps included in this assessment were selected to highlight disparities and inequities among Chicago community areas . |Page 14 Population Description and Child Opportunity Index In the City of Chicago, 23 percent (n=631,569) of the population is 0-19 years old. The communities with the largest number of youth in this age bracket are on the West and Southwest sides of Chicago and include the ZIP codes of 60623, 60629, 60632, and 60639 (Figure 6). The greatest proportion of households with children under the age of 18 years are also found on the West and Southwest sides of the city (Figure 6). RACE/ETHNICITY - Figure 7 shows estimates of the predominant racial and ethnic groups by community area across Chicago . In 2017, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated 32.7 percent of Chicagoans identify as Non -Hispanic white, 30.1 percent identify as Non-Hispanic black/African American, 29.0 percent as Hispanic/Latinx, and 6.2 percent as Asian. Racial and ethnic segregation in Chicago is well above national median levels (Metropolitan Planning Council, 2017). The consequences of this segregation are discussed further in The Role of Racism section starting on page 38. The distribution of race and ethnicity for Chicago youth is notably different (Figure 8). The largest population of youth 0-19 years old are Hispanic/Latinx, followed by Non -Hispanic black/African American, Non -Hispanic white, and Non -Hispanic Asian. Figure 6. Pediatric population density, Chicago, 0-19 years old (left) and households with one or more people under 18 years by zip code (Americ an Community Survey , 5-year estimates, 2017) |Page 15 IMMIGRATION - An estimated 21% of Chicago residents are foreign -born (U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2016 5-year estimates). In 2016, 1.6 million Illinois residents were native -born Americans who had at least one immigrant parent (American Immigration Council, 2017). In 2015, the top countries of origin for foreign -born individuals living in Illinois were Mexico (38.2 percent of immigrants), India (8.1 percent), Poland (7 percent), the Philippines (5 percent), and China (4.3 percent) (American Immigration Council, 2017). Within Chicago , there are several communities with large concentrations of individuals that have limited English Proficiency (Figure 9). A 2012 study in California found that individuals who reported limited English proficiency had rates of low health literacy that were three times higher than English speakers (Sentell & Braun, 2012).

The index includes 19 metrics across three domains : Educational , Health/ Environmental, and Social/ Economic ( Table 2). Figure 10 shows that neighborhoods with Low and Very Low COI are predominantly found on Chicago's South and West sides. Table 2.

Child Opportunity Index (COI) by Chicago community area |Page 17 Life Expectancy and Years of Potential Life Lost Two additional measures that reflect the health of a community and population are life expectancy and years of potential life lost (Figure 11). There are profound differences in both among different communities in Chicago. Children born on the South and West sides of Chicago can expect to live up to 16.5 fewer year s than children born in the Loop or on the North side. Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) is a measure of premature death . Like life expectancy, YPLL varies greatly between communities in Chicago , with communities on the South and West sides having the greatest burden of premature mortality . National life expectancy at birth was highest among Asians (86.3 years ), followed by Hispanic/Latinx (81.8 years years) (Acciai, Noah, & Firebaugh, 2015; National Center for Health Statistics, 2017) . In Chicago, life expectancy at birth was highest among Asians (83.0 years), followed by Hispanic/Latinx (80.7 years), whites (80.2 years), and black/African Americans (71.9 years ) (Chicago Health Atlas). Life expectancy (2016 estimates) across Chicago community areas ranges from 60 to 90 years. Figure 12 shows the relationship between life expectancy and neighborhood level poverty. Here, life expectancy has been categorized as lower or higher than the average life expected in the U.S for 2016 (78.6 years). Poverty has been categorized as less than or more than 15 percent of households in a neighborhood being at or below the federal poverty line. Communities with lower life expectancies are concentrated in the West and South sides of the city, within areas of high poverty . Figure 11. Life expectancy (left) and years of potential life lost (right) by Chicago community area (Chicago Health Atlas) |Page 18 Maternal Health and Infant Mortality Maternal health is defined as the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth, and in the postpartum period (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2018) . This period is a critical time for women's health since they typically have more interaction with and access to healthcare services (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2018) . Severe pregnancy complications (maternal morbidity) and mortality rates are used on an international level to assess the overall health status of a country, state, or community (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2018) . Since the year 2000, maternal mortality rates in the United States have been increasing even though the global trend has been the opposite (MacDorman, Declercq, Cabral, & Morton, 2016) . In addition, maternal health disparities exist between racial and ethnic groups (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2018) . The persistent nature of racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health indicate that inequities are due to more than just access to healthcare but include factors such as poverty, quality of education, health literacy, employment, housing, childcare availability, and community safety (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2018) . Racism is a driving force of these social determinants (American Public Health Assoc iation, 2019) . In addition, both systematic racism and provider bias affect the quality of healthcare that certain populations receive (Hoffman, Trawalter, Axt, & Oliver, 2016) . Severe m aternal morbidity is a potentially life-threatening condition or complication that occurs during labor and delivery (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2018) . Black/African American women have rates of severe maternal morbidity that are nearly three times higher than the rate for white women (Figure 13). Women on Figure 12. Life expectancy at birth vs. neighborhood poverty rate (American Community Survey, 5-year estimates, 2016) Higher Poverty Lower Life Expectancy |Page 19 Medicaid have a higher rate of severe maternal morbidity (57.1 per 10,000 deliveries) than women with private insurance (48.6 per 10,000 deliveries) (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2018) . Between 2005 and 2015, the national infant mortality rate decreased by 14 percent from 6.86 to 5.90 deaths per 1,000 live births (National Center for Health Statistics, 2017) . However, infant mortality rates in Illinois and in Chicago fell above the national average. Moreover, marked disparities in infant mortality rates are evident across Chicago community areas (Figure 14) and, as with maternal health, racial and ethnic disparities persist. In Illinois, the infant mortality rate per 1,00 0 live births (2012 -2016) was 4.4 for whites, 5.5 for Hispanic/Latinx and 12.6 for black/African American In Chicago, infant mortality rates per 1,000 live births (2012- 2016) was 3.4 for whites , 6.3 for Hispanic/Latinx and 12.7 for black/African American (Figure 15) Figure 15. Infant mortality rates per 1,000 live births in Chicago by race and ethnicity (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2012- 2016) * *The infant mortality rate for Asians is suppressed in Chicago due to insufficient population size 3613 White Hispanic/Latinx Black/African AmericanFigure 14.

In Chicago these indicators are higher with 9.6 percent of infants born low birthweight and 10.7 percent born preterm. Chicago's teen birth rate of 24.6 live births per 1,000 women , 15-19 years old, is also higher than the national average of 18.8 (National Center for Health Statistics, 2017). Similar to infan t mortality, there are disparities in low birthweight *, preterm births, and teen birth rates across Chicago community areas (Figure 16) and among races/ ethnic ities (Table 3). Figure 16.

P. Larson, 2007; Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2009) : Children born to mothers without a high school education are twice as likely to die before their first birthday as children born to mothers who are college graduates Access to quality preconception, prenatal, and postnatal healthcare can greatly improve maternal and child health outcomes Maternal poverty has been linked to greater risks for preterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, neonatal death, and infant death Maternal poverty has consistently been found to be a significant determinant of delayed cognitive development and poor school performance in children Neighborhood -specific Service Area Within Chicago, Lurie Children's has identified the 60639 ZIP code as a priority area of focus. Using Lurie Children's data (including emergency room visits , potential child maltreatment referrals and mental health care waitlists) , we identified 60639 (Figure 17), which includes the Chicago community areas of Belmont Cragin and Austin, as the neighborhoods that account for our largest patient volumes in each of these areas. Among 12th-grade students surveyed as part of the Illinois Youth Survey in 2018, 62 percent of students in Belmont Cragin reported using alcohol and 39 percent repo rted that they had experienced depression in the past year. Nearly half of 8th-grade students in Belmont Cragin reported that they had experienced bullying due to a disability or their appearance in the past year. For 12th-grade students in Austin, nearly half (49 percent ) indicated that they had used marijuana and 38 percent experienced depression in the past year - higher than the overall totals in Illinois as seen in Table 4.

The final survey tool included 16 questions \u2014 three questions related to ZIP code/community of residence, nine demographic questions, two multi -select questions about health problems and what is needed for a healthy community, and two open -ended questions about community strengths and improvements needed. The Survey Tool is included in Appendix C. A map showing the distribution of survey respondents across the city and county is presented in Figu re 18.

In terms of |Page 24 things needed for a 'Healthy Community,' responde nts identified access to healthcare and mental health services (48 percent ), safety and low crime (39 percent ), access to community services (31 percent ), access to healthy food (30 percent ) and affordable housing (28 percent ) as the top five (Figure 20). Respondents were asked two open -ended questions: \" What are the greatest strengths or best things in the community where you live? (list up to 3)\" and \"What is one thing that you would like to see improved in your community? \" Nearly 40 themes were identified across community residents' responses to both questions. The top five themes for greatest community strengths included community cohesion (47 percent), transportation (27 percent), safety and low crime (20 percent ), parks and recreation (18 percent ), and accessibility (16 percent ) (Figure 21). In terms of community improvements, safety and low crime (30 percent ), economic development (7.5 percent ), healthcare (6.3 percent ), infrastructure (6.3 percent ) and community cohesion (5.8 percent ) were the top five (Figure 22).

Lurie Children's promoted the Youth Survey through community -based partners, Lurie Children's Healthy Communities Internal Advisory Board, and other internal stakeholders. We received 118 total responses - four were excluded as incompl ete and 11 additional were excluded as over the age of 25 years, leaving 103 youth respondents. Using Human Resource employee data, we identified 518 employees living in and around employees were emailed a link to the survey and 74 respondents (14.2 percent) completed the survey.

In terms of community improvements, youth and employees identified safety and low crime as the top opportunity for improvement , like the broader Chicago community. Youth and employees also identified transportation and diversity and inclusion as top five priorities for community improvements (Figure 27). Figure 25.

IPHI developed the focus group questions using resources from existing CHNA toolkits and peer -reviewed studies, in consultation with the CHNA committee and colleagues at partner health departments. Each focus group was hosted by a community -based organization or hospital, and participation ranged from three to 40 people. Most focus groups were 90 minutes long with an average of 10 participants. Lurie Children's Interviews In addition to the community input collected for the Collaborative CHNA, Lurie Children's conducted interviews with parents and caregivers (n = 45) between December 2018 and January 2019 in our priority area of 60639 , specifically Belmont Cragin and Austin . These focused on the needs of parents and caregivers and family supports broadly. Needs related to social determinants of health, including food insecurity and housing stability, were discussed. Additionally, parents and caregivers were interested in increasing their health literacy, navigating health insurance , creating safe environments, learning about child development , gaining positive discipline skills , and prioritizing self- care. Concerns related to manag ing the health conditions of their children and adolescents were discussed, including asthma, food allergies, and obesity. Additionally, parents and caregivers were concerned about social issues impacting their children and adolescents, including bullying, school safety, sex and sexually -transmitted infections, social media, and positive body images. Lurie Children's Focus Groups Lurie Children's facilitated six focus groups between January and May 2019 with patients (n = 14) and patient families (n = 24), youth (n = 24) and parents (n = 20) from 60639, and Lurie Children's employees (n = 43). The focus groups with patients and patient families focused on community strengths, top health and social needs and ways to address the needs identified. PATIENTS - P atients were members of Lurie Children's Kids Advisory Board and ranged in age from 14 to 18 years old. Three out of 14 lived in Belmont Cragin, four others lived in the City of Chicago, including Gold Coast, Lincoln Park, Rogers Park and West Lawn. The remaining lived outside of Chicago. The overall themes included the need for better school supports, mental and behavioral health, social determinants of health , and transitioning care and services into adulthood. All patients were living with chronic med ical conditions, most with complex chronic conditions and this was a reoccurring topic of discussion, particularly in terms of how they manage through resilience : \"When you have these challenges, they [the challenges] kind of help you. Sometimes things in life change, but then the pain helps you accept things, and you start to realize it makes you stronger.\" Patients also discussed challenges they faced managing their diagnosis and their school environments and social circles: \"sometimes peers or your frien ds don't understand that if you're in the hospital you need extra time to get school work done, but they don't understand.\" Many felt that they were missing important linkages between school, home and the hospital. Community input from the Collaborative CHNA's 52 community input sessions (focus groups and learning map sessions) throughout Chicago and Cook County is integrated throughout the assessment in blue COMMUNTY INPUT boxes. |Page 32 Mental and behavioral health were also prominent topics of discussion, including substance use, self- harm and suicide and lack of access: \"It's hard to find places in my area that have these services .\" Patients discussed community violence and perceptions of safety in their neighborhood: \"I don' t want to say that it's a dangerous neighborhood, but I have to be home at a certain time, before it gets dark. There are a lot of weird people in my neighborhood.\" Patients also discussed the need for tailored medical services and help planning for adulth ood. PATIENT FAMIL IES - Patient families included members of our Family Advisory Board and parents and caregivers of the members of the Kids Advisory Board. Three out of the 20 patient family members lived in Belmont Cragin, seven others lived in Chicago, including Beverly, Hyde Park, Lincoln Park, Pilsen, Portage Park, River North, and Uptown. The remaining lived outside of Chicago. The main themes discussed included access to care, mental and behavioral health , social determinants of health and the built environment. Families were concerned about the cost of healthcare services and prescriptions, but also discussed challenges they faced navigating the healthcare system, particularly the complexities of health insurance , healthcare quality and difficulty getting appointments: \"Access to healthcare is now between 9 am and 3 pm. It's so hard to get appointments. Sometimes if it's too challenging, you just skip it. Could clinicians expand availability to evening and weekends, particularly specialties like GI and cardiology, which are the hardest to schedule?\" Mental h ealth supports were discussed repeatedly, including the supports for the whole family and difficulties with accessing mental health services: \"My child is currently awaiting [procedure redacted for privacy]. I looked for counseling for her and I could only find one person in [my community]. They didn't accept insurance and I can't afford to pay out of pocket.\" One family member was even moved to enroll in a clinical psychology graduate program to address the workforce shortage they had experienced personally. Families were concerned with transportation, particularly for their children with special needs and discussed the lack of accessibility and walkability in their communities. Affordable and accessible housing was also a priority, particularly for families with children who use wheelchairs or have limited mobility. Families discussed these challenges in the context of community supports and social conn ections to address the related need: \"[Regarding challenges with a walk -up rental unit] The fire department helped carry my daughter up and down the stairs to help out and to get her to school. They are there to help.\" COMMUNITY YOUTH AND PARENTS - Lurie Children's worked with Northwest Side Housing Center to coordinate two focus groups with youth and parents in Belmont Cragin . The youth group discussions focused on what makes a community healthy, things participants would like to change about their communi ty, and how these are connected to health and wellbeing. The main themes identified were the social determinants of health (e.g., housing and homelessness, education), community cohesion (e.g., friendly neighbors, sense of belonging) , built environment and transportation (e.g., street conditions , public transit, bike lanes), community violence and crime, and youth programming and opportunities (e.g., sports and recreation, job training and opportunities) . The p arent group was conducted in Spanish, with thre e Spanish -speaking facilitators. Parents were prompted to answer the focus group questions through collage and the creation of a vision board in small groups of two- three. Parents then presented their vision board and discussed the strengths of Belmont Cragin and what's missing that could make their community an even better place to live and raise their families. Most of the discussion focused on social determinants of health and various factors related to social and environmental conditions in their community. Reoccurring themes included immigration and family separation, racism and discrimination, safety and relationships with law enforcement, community cohesion , family values and faith, clean environment, healthy food access, and educational and recreational opportunities for their children. |Page 33 Immigration, discrimination and family separation were discussed by a majority of the 10 groups that presented, often in terms of how the two topics are interrelated for their community: \"We are all immigrants, and we get treated poorly. ICE has taken our people; they did nothing wrong besides being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" Participants also discussed challenges with law enforcement: \"My home got broken into, and they thought my husband and I were the intruders when the police arrived, although we are the ones that called the cops.\" Another participant noted perceived bias in terms of law enforcement: \"I got pulled over because my car was 'too nice to be mine.'\" Participants felt a lack of trust in law enforcement, even though many were concerned about safety and violence in their community: \"We also don't feel comfortable reporting crimes because cops accuse us of being criminals, although we are asking for help.\" \"We never know if we'll make it back to our families\" (in reference to shootings/gun violence) . Faith and family were discussed as cornerstone values for many of the participants: \"God is fundamental for family structure - it helps us raise kids and keep our families together .\" Climate change and the impacts on the environment were important concerns of focus group participants: \"We can't cause change at an individual level, we need to work together to preserve our planet .\" Access to healthy , affordable foods was discussed by multiple groups: \"We want to eat healthy, but we can't afford it, a head of lettuce went up to $2, and a cheeseburger is $1.\" Participants also wanted more knowledge about how to prepare healthy foods: \"We know that we're supposed to eat healthier, but sometimes we don't know how to combine the food to make it taste good .\" Every g roup shared their concer ns and hopes for their children : \"I work in Subway, and I see high school kids staying until 10 or 11 p.m. because they have nothing to do.\" Participants discussed the need for more and varied recreational opportunities : \"Not everyone like soccer & basketball, we need more options .\" Education was discussed, particularly in terms of how pare nts and caregivers can support youth in educational attainment: \"How can we as parents/grandparents help children finish school, we don't want more drop outs .\" EMPLOYEES - Lurie Children's convened 41 employees in May 2019 as part of the city-wide On the Table forum , created by The Chicago Community Trust, to discuss the strengths of and challenges facing Chicago , including potential solutions to address the needs identified and Lurie Children's role in those solutions . In terms of Chicago's strengths, the discussion included Chicago's diversity, civic engagement and non-profit community -based organizations, museums and other cultural institutions, parks and recreation, youth opportunities, and state- of-the-art hospitals and health systems. Participants also discussed issues facing Chicago. The main themes of discussion included inequality, segregation and racism; violence and child injury; unmet physical and mental health needs; lack of healthy food access and affordable, quality housing; and unequal access to education and economic opportunities. Participants brainstormed potential solutions to strengthen children and families with a focus on policies and initiatives that will strengthen communities, improve access to physical and mental health services, make Chicago safer, improve education and advance equity. Voices of Child Health in Chicago In partnership with the Chicago Department of Public Health , Lurie Children's develop ed and field ed the Healthy Chicago Survey Jr. (HCS- Jr). HCS- Jr is a set of child health -focused modules that were added to the annual Healthy Chicago Survey (HCS), beginning in December 2017. As a population -representative, city-wide phone - based survey originally launched in 2014, HCS is designed to characterize the health of Chicag oans, including |Page 34 health concerns for each community and the social and environmental factors that impact health. The version with HCS- Jr was fielded through June 2018 and collected data from 3,310 adults regarding their perspectives on child health specifically. Individuals were asked what their biggest concerns were for the health of children in Chicago. Figure 28 lists the top 10 health problems for children and adolescents in Chicago, based on survey responses . Survey respondents were also asked which social issues are \"big problems\" for children and adolescents in the city\u2014not just their own kids. Figure 29 lists the Top 10 social issues for children and adolescents in Chicago , as seen by parents in Chicago Figure 28. Top 10 health problems facing children and adolescents in Chicago, reported by Chicago adults (HSC -Jr, 2017 -2018) Figure 29.

Figure 30. Priority Community Health Issues, Alliance for Health Equity, Chicago and Suburban Cook County, 2019 Access to Care, Community Resources, and Systems Improvements Increased Health Equity, Improved Health, Improved Quality of Life, Increased Life Expectancy |Page 36 Lurie Children's 2019 CHNA Priorities For more than 100 years, Lurie Children's mission has been to improve the health and well- being of children. In order to steward this mission in Chicago in the coming years, our overarching community health strategy goal must be to advance health equity for youth and their families. Consideration of family context connects directly to the Maternal and Child Health priority in Alliance for Health Equity Model and is a cross -cutting emphasis in our assessment. In our 2019 CHNA, we focus on the following priority domains to advance our overarching goal (Figure 31): Social Determinants of Health (page 41) Access to Care (page 50) Chronic Health Conditions (page 55) Mental and Behavioral Health (page 61) Unintentional Injury and Violence (page 68) Healthy Peop le 2020, developed by the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , includes access to healthcare services as a social determinant of health. Like the Alliance for Health Equity Model, Lurie Children's elevates this particular social determinant of health to a priority domain because providing pediatric healthcare services is one of the pillars of our mission to enhance the health and well- being of all children . Both Social Determinants of Health and Access to Care are primary drivers for the subsequent priority domains of (1) Chronic Health Conditions , (2) Mental and Behavioral Health , and (3) Unintentional Injury and Violence . OVERVIEW OF HEALTH INEQUITIES Health inequities can be defined as differences in the incidence, prevalence, mortality, burden of disease, or the distribution of health determinants between different population groups (National Institutes of Health, 2017; World Health Organization ). Health inequities can exist across many dimensions such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability status, socioeconomic status, geographic location, and military status (National Academies of Sciences, Baciu, Negussie, Geller, & Weinstein, 2017) . There are four overarching concepts that demonstrate the necessity of addressing health inequities: 1. Inequities are unjust - Health inequities result from the unjust distribution of the underlying determinants of health such as education, safe housing, access to healthcare , and employment 2. Inequities affect everyone - Conditions that lead to health disparities are detrimental to all members of society and lead to loss of income, lives, and potential 3. Inequities are avoidable - Many health inequities stem directly from aspects of government policies and can, therefore, be addressed through policy interventions 4. Interventions to reduce health inequities are cost -effective - Evidence- based public health programs to reduce or prevent health inequities can be extremely cost-effective particularly when compared to the financial burden of persistent disparities (Metropolitan Planning Council, 2017; National Academies of Sciences et al., 2017; Woodward & Kawachi, 2000) Figure 31. Lurie Children's 2019 CHNA priority domains |Page 37 It is important to note that equality and equity are different (Figure 32). While equality is about treating everyone the same with equal access and resources, equity takes into consideration the unique needs and assets of the individual or population to provide tailored supports . Health inequities involve more than unequal access to the resources needed to maintain or improve health (World Health Organization ). THE ROLE OF RACISM Race and ethnicity are socially constructed categories that have profound effects on the lives of individuals and communities as a whole. Racial and ethnic disparities are arguably the most persistent inequities in health over time in the United States (National Academies of Sciences et al., 2017) . Racial and ethnic inequities in health are directly linked to racism. \"Racism is the system of structuring opportunity and assigning value based on the social interpretation of how one looks (which is what we call \"race\"), that unfairly disadvantages some individuals and communities, unfairly advantages other individuals and communities, and saps the strength of the whole society through the waste of human resources.\" American Public Health Association (APHA) Past Presi dent Camara Jones, MD, PhD, MPH Racism diminishes the overall health of our nation by preventing some people the opportunity to attain their highest level of health and is a driving force of the social determinants of health (American Public Health Association, 2019) . In addition, racism can be traumatic to the individuals and communities that are routinely exposed to it, thus causing and exacerbating health inequities. Racism can be unintentional or intentional and operates at individual and systemic levels . Figure 32. The difference between equality and equity (TEQuity and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2018) |Page 38 There is a common misconception that racism is a rare problem of isolated, individual attitudes and actions , or most damagingly \u2014that racism is a thing of the past (Race Forward, 2014) . While individual racism is important to address, it is particularly important to understand and address the institutional and structural levels of racism (Race Forward, 2014) . When addressing racism, the focus should be shifted from intent or conscious attitudes and beliefs and turned to interventions that acknowledge the systems and structures that are either supporting positive outcomes or hindering them (Powell, 2013) . Segregation , Racial Inequities, and Health in the Chicago Metro Area Federal and local policies that established and continue to sustain racial and ethnic segregation in Chicago are rooted in racism (Metropolitan Planning Council, 2017) . A 2017 study by the Metrop olitan Planning Council and The Urban Institute analyzed economic, racial, and ethnic segregation patterns in the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the Unites States to determine what the impacts would be if the Chicago region reduced its levels of segrega tion to the median levels of the nation's 100 biggest metro areas (Metropolitan Planning Council, 2017) . The study found that segregation in the Chicago metro area significantly decreases the region's overall economic performance, results in higher homicide rates and increased loss of life, and results in much lower rates of post - secondary educational attainment among whites and black/African Americans (Metropolitan Planning Council, 2017) . Achieving Racial Equity Racial equity is reached when race and ethnicity no longer determine an individual or community's socioeconomic and health outcomes (Center for Social Inclusion) . Racial equity is achieved when those most impacted by structural and institutional inequity are meaningfully involved in the creation and implementation of institutional policies and practices that impact their lives (Center for Social Inclusion) . Racial equity in health is achieved when the health outcomes of all racial and ethnic groups are indistinguishabl e from each other. The Relationship between Inequities, Trauma, and Toxic Stress Inequities are particularly injurious to the communities that experience them not only because they limit access to services and other resources, but also because the experien ces of marginalization and discrimination are traumatic. Research has established that traumatic experiences can cause stress that is toxic to the body and can result in dysregulation, inflammation, and disease. The effects of trauma and toxic stress are detrimental throughout the lifespan and can be particularly deleterious when exposure begins in childhood. As a result, exposure to trauma and the resulting toxic stress contribute to widening health disparities. Supporting and partnering with communities that have experienced trauma to build resiliency is an important step in reducing health inequities. However, it is critical to address the underlying root causes of traumatizing inequities with a focus on future prevention. |Page 39 COMMUNITY INPUT - Discussions about inequities occurred in focus groups across the city. Participants highlighted inequities in social determinants of health, access to healthcare, and healthcare quality, in particular. Communities of color, children, LGBTQ+, immigrants, individuals living with disabilities, and individuals living with mental illness or a substance use disorder were described as sharing the greatest burden of these inequities. \"It feels like this structural racism is impacting everything. I mean whether we' re talking about the meetings we can attend, whether we're talking about the properties we can buy because of redlining, whether we're talking about being able to afford insurance. It really permeates everything from economics to education to even the way that we think.\" (Garfield Park Community Council Learning Map Session) \"I moved from the South side and predominately black communities. There's a lack of affordable decent housing, lack of nutritious food \u2014everywhere except the North side.\" (NAMI Chicago - Individuals) \"On the West side there isn't much funding to create better opportunities like schools and jobs.\" (Breakthrough) \"Engage youth, start with the education system. As black children, we have poor education.\" (After School Matters Learning Map Session). \"Soon we will be adults in this community, so they need to give us the education, teachers, and better schools we need because that will advocate for a better Harvey in the future.\" (Restoration Ministries) \"Healthcare is not looking to provide services to the LGBTQ community in a way that they are providing services to well -to-do cis-gendered heterosexual whites .\" (Affinity Community Services) |Page 40 SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH According to the World Health Organization, social determinants of health (SDoH) are the social, economic, and environmental conditions into which people are born, live, work, and age. These factors include (1) economic stability, (2) education, (3) neighborhood and built environment, (4) social and community context, and (5) access to healthcare (Figure 33). Resea rch has long established that SDoH are primary drivers of health outcomes (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2008). Children born to mothers without a high school education are twice as likely to die before their first birthday as children born to mothers who are college graduates Self-reported poor health increases with decreasing levels of income and education Low-income individuals are more likely to have a chronic disease These socioeconomic factors are interrelated and interdependent. For the purposes of this report, data related to SDoH are reported across sections. In this section , specific data related to economic stabi lity, education and neighborhood and built environment will be reported , with inequities and disparities highlighted where possible. Community violence and safety will be discussed in the Unintentional Injury and Violence section. Data related healthcare insurance and services are discussed in the Access To Care section. Lurie C hildren's has begun a process to expand screening of patients for social determinants of health, and to provide resources to help address these issues. Other health systems increasingly recognize the role of social determinants of health and the importance of collecting information on social needs (Feinglass et al., 2018; Rizzo et al., 2016). Figure 33. Model of Social Determinants of Health, modified from Healthy People 2020 Community Input - Socioeconomic inequities were mentioned in several focus groups. Inequities in community economic investment and development, employment opportunities, transportation resources, quality affordable housing, education opportunities, and food access were highlighted particularly by groups held on the West and South sides of the city and county. In addition, groups held on the North side of the city highlighted disparities in resource distribution, with the North side having the most access to economic opportunities and community resources. Focus group participants attributed the lack of business investment and economic resources on the South and West sides to underlying factors such as long -term disinvestment in certain communities, the loss of locally owned businesses, limited educational resources, low levels of home ownership, and minimal job opportunities. Similarly, community input survey respondents identified areas for improvement in their communities that related to socioeconomic inequities including more job opportunities, lower housing costs, more affordable food options, and increased school funding. |Page 41 Poverty Poverty can create barriers to accessing quality health services, healthy food, recreation opportunities, and other necessities of good health status. It strongly influences housing stability, educational opportuniti es, living environment, and health behaviors. Examples of how poverty shapes and impacts the health of children and communities include : In 2017, 86.1 percent of people in households with an annual income of less than $25,000 had health insurance coverage , compared with 92.1 percent of people in households with income of $75,000 to $99,999, and 95.7 percent of people in households with income of $125,000 (Berchick, Hood, & Barnett, 2018). Research indicates that communities with better access to healthy foods and limited access to convenience stores have healthier diets and lower rates of obesity (Larson, Story, & Nelson, 2009). Low- income communities are less likely to have access to supermarkets and healthy foods and tend to have a higher density of fast-food restaurants and other sources of unhealthy food such as convenience stores (Larson et al., 2009). There tends to be a higher density of tobacco retailers in low-income communities, and smoking rates are higher among people living in poverty (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ; Yu, Peterson, Sheffer, Reid, & Schneider, 2010). L ow -income communities tend to have fewer recreational resources such as park space and recreational programs (Dahmann, Wolch, Joassart -Marcelli, Reynolds, & Jerrett, 2010). Lower access to parks and recreational programs has been linked to lower physical activity and higher body mass indexes (BMIs) among children (Wolch et al., 2011). Low-income communities are more likely to have higher rates of violence, higher rates of discrimination, under -resourced schools, higher rates of unemployment, higher rates of incarceration, and greater material deprivation such as a lack of housing, heat, water, and electricity (Khullar & Chokshi, 2018). These issues are chronic stressors that are linked to higher rates of chronic disease throughout the lifespan (Khullar & Chokshi, 2018). Child development can be affected by the experience of poverty, increasing chronic stress, food insecurity, and more frequent infectious diseases (Jens en, Berens & Nelson, 2017). In Illinois, whites and black/African American adults in the lowest income group had the highest prevalence of reporting four or more adverse childhood experiences (Health & Medicine Policy Research Group, 2013). There are inequities in the geographic distribution of poverty. Communities with the highest poverty rates are primarily concentrated in the West and South sides of the of the City of Chicago , with over 40 percent of households in West Garfield Park, East Garfield Park, North Lawndale, Washington Park, and Englewood below the federal poverty level (Figure 34). Overall, t he percentage of individuals living in poverty in Chicago (21 percent ) is higher than the state (14 percent ) and national averages (15 percent ) - more than one out of four children and adolescents 0-19 years old (27.3 percent ) lives in poverty . However, people of color , especially children of color, experience higher rates of poverty than non-Hispanic whites (Figure 35). Of Chicago youth living in poverty, 44.3 percent are black/African American, followed by Hispanic/Latinx (27.6 percent), Asian (19.7 percent), and Non-Hispanic white (7.1 percent) (American Community Survey, U.S. Census Bureau). Black/African Americans and Hispanic s/Latinxs also have the lowest median household incomes. |Page 42 Education and Employment Education is an important determinant of health . Poverty, unemployment, and underemployment are higher among those with lower levels of educational attainment than those with higher levels (Figure 36). In addition, rates of self-reported poor health, infant mortality, and chronic disease are often higher among individuals with lower levels of educational attainment. A 2011 study found that a history of segregation in the United States has not only led to continued racial and ethnic segregation of schools, but that whites and Asians are disproportionately represented in higher - performing schools (Logan, 2011). The same report found that disparities in school performance are likely due to Figure 34. Distribution of households below the federal poverty level (left) and children living in households below the federal poverty level (right) (American Community Survey, 5-year estimates, 2016) Figure 35. Percentage of children living in poverty by race and ethnicity in Chicago (American Community Survey, 5- year estimates, 2016) 4428209 Black/African AmericanHispanic/LatinxAsianWhite|Page 43 racial and ethnic disparities in poverty and not the racial composition of schools (Logan, 2011). Although overall high school graduation rates in Chicago (84 percent) are comparable to state (89 percent) and national rates (88 percent ), there are profound differences between racial and ethnic groups. In Chicago, non-Hispanic whites and Asians have the highest rates of high school graduation and the highest rates of educational attainment overall ( Figure 37). In addition to elementary, secondary, and post - secondary inequities , there are disparities in early childhood education and scho ol readiness as well. Socioeconomic status of parents is the biggest driver of school -readiness, access to quality childcare, and access to early childhood education resources (Garcia & Weiss, 2015). As a result of the socioeconomic inequities associated with race and ethnicity, children of color often lag behind their white peers when starting kindergarten and these delays can impact school success throughout the lifespan (Garcia & Weiss, 2015). In Chicago, the geographic disparities in educational attainm ent are greatest between the West side of Chicago and the North side and downtown area (Figure 38). Communities like Belmont Cragin, Hermosa, South Lawndale, Brighton Park, Archer Heights, Lower West Side, New City, Gage Park, West Lawn and Armour Square have the highest proportion (30 percent ) of residents without a high school education. Unemploymen t and underemployment can create financial instability, which influences access to healthcare services, insurance, healthy foods, stable quality housing, and other basic needs for the unemployed adult as well as children in the household . Lack of access to employer -sponsored health insurance and related benefits impacts healthcare access. Unemployment and underemployment in Chicago are often associated with a history of disinvestment and economic segregation. In the mid to late 20th century, much of the West and South sides of the city were thriving due to factory employment. As the factory industry started to move to lower cost locations, so did the job opportunities. The disinvestment in Chicago created a racial gap in employment opportunities that still has not been closed (Henricks, Lewis, Arenas, & Lewis, 2017). In 2016, unemployment rates for adults over age 16 in Chicago (8.1 percent ) were similar to the state (8 percent) and national averages (7 percent ) - overall, since 2012, unemployment rates have been trending down from a high of 13.7 percent . However, the unemployment rate for American American/black Chicagoans (16.8 percent ) is still twice the overall rate and over 5 times higher than the unemployment rate for non-H ispanic white Chicagoans (3.2 percent ). Figure 37. Percent adults 25 and older with less than a high school education in Chicago by race/ethnicity (American Community Survey, 5-year estimates, 2016) 1632135 Black/African AmericanHispanic/LatinxAsianWhiteFigure 36.

High rates of unemployment are concentrated in communities of color in the South and West sides of the city (Figure 39). There are significant differences in unemployment across racial and ethnic groups (Figure 40). Chicago has the great est racial disparities in young adult employment in the nation (Svajlenka, 2016). In 2016, the employment rate among black/African Americans 20-24 years old was 47 percent, the lowest in the nation, and the rate for whites in the same age group was 73 percent , one of the highest in the nation (Svajlenka, 2016). Low-income workers and underemployed workers face many of the same challenges as unemployed individuals. For example, while 58 percent of the overall population have employer -sponsored health insurance, only 35 percent of people in households making less than 250 percent of the federal poverty Figure 39. Percent of unemployed adults 16 years old and older in the civilian labor force in Chicago (American Community Survey, 5-year estimates, 2016) Figure 38. Educational attainment in Chicago - Percent of Chicagoans 25 years old and older without a high school education (left) and with a bachelor's or higher (right) (American Community Survey, 5-year estimates, 2016) |Page 45 level have employer -sponsored health insurance (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2018). Health insuran ce gaps can lead to a decrease in utilization of preventative healthcare services. Additionally, underemployed individuals have reported more depression, alcohol abuse, and poorer physical health (America's Health Rankings) . COMMUNITY INPUT - Education inequities and lack of employment opportunities were frequently discussed within focus groups. The major education -related concerns expressed by focus groups included: School closures and diminishing education opportunities on the West and South sides of Chicago Poor quality schools particularly on the South side of Chicago Limited or nonexistent resources for learning trades Lack of support programs such as quality, low-cost tutoring Limited adult education programs Participants linked education inequitie s to issues such as higher rates of community violence, increases in health issues such as substance use disorders and mental illness, and generational poverty. Reinvestment in community schools was nearly a universal recommendation from groups that discus sed education issues. Community input survey respondents referred to educational opportunities in their community throughout the survey. Approximately one-fifth of respondents reported that good schools were key factors for a healthy community. While some respondents cited education as one of the greatest strengths in the community, other respondents chose education as an area for growth showing the inequities of education. Again, participants living in the West and South sides described having the least quality job opportunities and employment resources. However, certain populations such as those living with mental illness, young adults, homeless individuals, and formerly -incarcerated individuals were highlighted as having significant barriers to employment regardless of their geographic location. Within some communities, jobs are available, but they are described as part -time, temporary, and/or low-paying. Additionally, 1 8 percent of community input survey respondents chose \"quality job opportunities\" as one of the most important factors in a healthy community. S urvey respondents frequently identified job opportunities as an area for improvement in their community. Figure 40. Percent unemployment among individuals 16 years old or older in Chicago by race/ethnicity (American Community Survey, 5-year estimates, 2016) 17%8%5%3% Black/African AmericanHispanic/LatinxAsianWhite|Page 46 Housing and Homelessness Poor housing conditions are associated with a wide range of health conditions including respiratory infections, asthma, lead poisoning, injuries, and poor mental health (Krieger & Higgins, 2002). As a result, addressing housing issues offers a unique opportunity to address an important social determinant of health (Krieger & Higgins, 2002). Research has confirmed that there are at least four direct pathways (Figure 41) in which housing impacts health (Taylor, 2018): Stability - not having a stable home Qual ity and Safety - conditions inside the home Affordability - financial burdens resulting from high -cost housing Neighborhood - the environmental and social characteristics of where people live STABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY - Homelessness and housing instability can have profound effects on health throughout the lifespan. Individuals who are homeless are more likely to become ill, have greater hospitalization rates, and have an increased burden of premature mortality (Maness & Khan, 2014). Caregivers of childre n 0 to 2 years old who have experienced unstable housing or homelessness are more likely to report fair or poor health, maternal depressive symptoms, and household material hardships (Sandel et al., 2018). In addition, their children have higher rates of lifetime hospitalizations and fair or poor child health (Sandel et al., 2018). Housing instability is associated with multiple health problems among youth and young adults including increased risk of teen pregnancy, early drug use, and depression (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2011). Experiencing foreclosure is associated with negative behavioral health outcomes such as depression, anxiety, increased alcohol use, psychological distress and suicide (Tsai, 2015). Unstable housing can decrease the effectivene ss of healthcare by making proper storage of medications difficult or impossible (Maqbool, Viveiros, & Ault, 2015). QUALITY AN D SAFETY - Environmental factors within homes are correlated with several poor health outcomes (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2011). Lead exposure can lead to permanent brain and nervous system damage in children (World Health Organization, 2018 ). Housing issues such as water leaks, poor ventilation, carpeting, and pest infestations have been associated with poor health outcomes such as allergies and asthma (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2011). Within Cook County, it is estimated that 39 percent of housing units have one or more substandard conditions (U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2017 ). Crowded housing has been found to have negative impacts on a child's school achievement, behavior, and physical health (Solari & Mare, 2012). Throughout Chicago, there are several communities in which 6 percent or more of households are considered overcrowded , including Belmont Cragin (Figure 42). Community -based programs and policy interventions have been shown to be effective in improving health through increasing the quality and safety of housing. Community -based interventions that remove potential asthma triggers from households have created improvements in quality of life, reduced emergency department visits, reduced hospitalizations, and reduced healthcare costs for both children and adults (Bhaumik et al., 2013; \"Gre en and Healthy Homes Initiative \"). Figure 41. Four pathways connecting housing and health (Taylor, 2018) |Page 47 In addition, smoking bans in public and affordable housing have led to reductions in the number of smokers, reductions in the number of cigarettes smoked per smoker, and reductions in secondhand smoke exposure among non-smokers (Kingsbury & Reckinger, 2016). AFFORDABIL IT Y - A lack of affordable housi ng can significantly impact a family's ability to access food, healthcare , community services and other basic needs. Low-income families that have difficulty paying their rent, mortgage or utility bills are less likely to have a primary care provider and are more likely to delay needed medical treatment (Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, 2011). In addition, severely cost- burdened renters and homeowners who are behind in their housing payments are more likely to be food insecure and go without prescribed medications (Alley et al., 2011; Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, 2017). In contrast, a 2010 study found that families that had affordable rent because of low-income housing credits increased their discretionary income by 77 percent , which put them in a position to buy health insuran ce, pay down debt or amass savings to pay for education or to buy a home (Walker, 2010). Within Chicago , there were approximately 120,000 subsidized housing units in 2018 (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development). In 2017, there was a shortage of 180,000 affordable rental housing units , an increase in the gap between the need and the supply of more than 2 0,000 units since 2007 (2019 State of Rental Housing in Cook County ). A h ousehold is considered cost- burdened when 35 percent or more of its monthly gross income is dedicated to housing. Severely cost-burdened households have 50 percent or more their monthly gross income dedicated to housing. Within Chicago there are several community areas where more than 44 percent of households are considered cost- burdened, primarily concentrated on the South and West sides, including Belmont Cragin and Austin (Figure 43). Figure 43. Distribution of cost burdened households in Chicago (American Community Survey, 5-year estimates, 2016 ) Figure 42. Distribution of crowded housing in Chicago (American Community Survey, 5-year estimates, 2016 ) |Page 48 NEIGHBORHOODS - There has been extensive research on the impacts that physical surroundings have on health. Access to public transportation, proximity to grocery stores with healthy foods and safe spaces to exercise have all been correlated with reduced chronic disease and improved health outcomes (Bell et al., 2013; Djurhuus et al., 2014; Ou et al., 2016). A Safe Routes to School Program that improved the number of sidewalks, bicycl e lanes and safe crossings increased the rate of bicycling and walking among school -aged children (DiMaggio, Brady, & Li, 2015). Remediated abandoned buildings and vacant lots have been associated with significantly decreased heart rates among those that walk past and significantly reduced firearm violence in the community (South, Kondo, Cheney, & Branas, 2015). In addition to physical characteristics, social characteristics of neighborhoods including segregation, crime, and social capital can have tremendo us impacts on health (Taylor, 2018). Food Access and Insecurity Food security is a household -level social and economic condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2018). Food insecurity can impact health in several ways (Weinfield et al., 2014): Combination of stress and poor nutrition can make individuals more susceptible to developing chronic diseases and make management of chronic diseases more difficult W orsening health problems and the associated medical c are puts additional strain on household budgets and leaves less money for essential nutrition and other basic needs Chronic disease can lead to decreased employability and lower overall household income Many communities in Chicago are at risk for food insecurity (Figure 44). Programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), local food pantries, summer meal programs, after school programs, shelters, and food banks provide important assistance to low-income individuals and families that struggle to acce ss adequate nutrition (Figure 44). COMMUNITY INPUT - Major themes from focus group discussions related to housing included: Segregation prevents communities from having diverse economics, racial/ethnic groups, and resources Concerns over gentrification that pushes low-income families out of communities Safe, quality housing is often not affordable and affordable housing is often not safe or good quality Oversight of landlords and homeowners is lacking in many communities |Page 49 ACCE SS TO CARE Access to healthcare is broadly defined as the \"the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best health outcomes\" (Institute of Medicine, 1993). Healthy People 2020 describes the three steps required for an individual to access healthcare services: Gaining entry into the healthcare system Accessing a location where needed healthcare services are provided Finding a healthcare provider whom the patient trusts and can communicate with (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019 ) There are several complex factors that further influence acces s to healthcare including proximity, affordability, availability, convenience, accommodation , reliability, quality, acceptability, openness, cultural responsiveness, appropriateness and approachability. COMMUNITY INPUT - Focus group participants across Chicago reported difficulty accessing healthy foods. Participants on the West and South sides of the city reported a high proportion of fast-food restaurants and limited access to grocery stores selling healthier options. Low -income participants on the North side reported that there were several grocery stores available but they often could not afford them. Over 30 percent of community input survey respondents chose \"access to healthy food\" as one of the most important factors for a 'Healthy Community.' Respondent s expanded upon food accessibility in their responses to the question related to areas for improvement in the community. Frequently, respondents mentioned a need for a grocery store in their community and increased access to healthy, affordable foods. Figure 44. Risk of food insecurity (left) and households receiving SNAP benefits (right) in Chicago (Greater Chicago Food Depository; American Community Survey, 5-year estimates, 2016 ) |Page 50 Healthcare Coverage Entry into the healthcare system is usually gained through healthcare coverage including both private and public insurance benefits (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2019). Fifty -three percent of Illinois residents receive insurance coverage through employer -sponsored plans. In Chicago , 13 percent of the population does not have health insurance coverage compared to 9 percent of the Illinois population (U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2017 ). However, uninsured rates are even higher among certain population groups. For example (Amadeo, 2019; Kaiser Family Foundation, 2019; U.S. Census Bureau, American Community Survey, 2017 ; Williamson, Antonisse, Tolbert, & Garfield, 2016) : Uninsured rates are highest among the populatio n 19-64 years old (18 percent ) compared to children under 19 years old (4 percent ) and adults over 65 years old (2 percent ) Uninsured rates among the Hispanic/Latinx population (21 percent ) are more than double those of the non-Hispanic white population (7 percent ) In the U.S., among the non-elderly , 23 percent of lawfully present immigrants and 45 percent of undocumented immigrants are uninsured compared to 8 percent of naturalized and native -born citizens In t he U.S., among citizen children, those with at least one non-citizen parent are more likely to be uninsured compared to those with citizen parents (7 percent vs 4 percent) One in five low-income Americans go without care because of cost compared to 1 in 25 high -income Americans Many of the working poor do not qualify for Medicaid and are often employed in professions that do not offer employer benefits The geographic distribution of uninsured youth 0-18 years old in Chicago and the Medicaid coverage rates for children age 0-17 years old are presented in Figure 45. Uninsured individuals are significantly less likely to Figure 45. Distribution of uninsured youth 0-18 years old (left) and youth 0-17 years old receiving publi c insurance coverage (right) (American Comm unity Survey, 5-year estimates, 2016 ) |Page 51 receive needed healthcare services. Nationwide, only 38 percent of uninsured adults visited a doctor in 2018 compared to 70 percent of those privately insured, and 74 percent of those with Medicaid cove rage (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2018 ). Proximity to Healthcare Services Previous research has established that patients living further away from healthcare facilities have worse health outcomes related to survival rates, length of stay in hospital, and non-attendance at follow -up visits than those who live closer (Kelly et al., 2016). In addition, socioeconomic inequities play a role in geographic proximity to healthcare services. Lurie Children's most significant partners in providing primary clinical and behavior healthcare to children in low/very low child opportunity neighborhoods are Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) . FQHCs have an important role in eliminating disparities in access to healthcare and are located throughout Chicago (Figure 46). Nationwi de, most FQHC patients have low incomes with 93 percent falling below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) and 72 percent below 100 percent of the FPL (National Association of Community Health Centers, 2015). Figure 46. Distribution of FQHCs in Chicago (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Providers of Service database, 2018) COMMUNITY INPUT - Focus group participants mentioned several common barriers that prevent them from accessing the healthca re system: Complexity of obtaining and keeping public benefit coverage Policy changes that have led to severe delays in the distribution of medical cards from the state Fear within immigrant communities that obtaining benefits will impact their ability to acquire citizenship status High cost of some private insurance plans Lack of knowledge about available insurance and benefit options Diminishing access to services that assist individuals with obtaining coverage Logistical issues related to making healthca re appointments and arranging needed transportation Provider shortages particularly for specialists Structural racism and discrimination that lead to differences in the quality and availability of healthcare services between communities Focus group participants stated that lacking healthcare coverage can lead to multiple issues that are linked to poor health outcomes , including severe stress, an inability to access preventative services, worsening of health conditions due to delayed care, an increased need for emergency care, and substantial personal debt. |Page 52 In addition to primary and preventative care, most FQHCs provide behavioral, oral, vision, and pharmacy services (National Association of Community Health Centers, 2015). By law FQHCs must (National Association of Community Health Centers, 2015): Serve a federally -designated medically underserved area or a medically underserved population Serve all individuals regardless of ability to pay Charge no more than a \"nominal fee\" to uninsured and underinsured individuals with incomes below 100 percent FPL, and charge uninsured and underinsured individuals between 101 - 200 percent FPL based on a sliding fee scale Provide non-clinical enabling services to increase access to care (e.g., transportation, translation, case management) Healthcare Quality Healthcare quality can vary greatly between communities due to several factors including the geographic proximity of a spectrum of emergency or urgent care services, proportion of the population receiving public benefits, funding for community -based services, education and training levels of healthcare staff, and localized provider shortages. Race and ethnicity also play a critical role in the quality of healthcare that patients receive. Figure 47 shows percentage of adults in Chicago who report ed that they were very satisfied with the health care they received in the past year by race/ethnicity . Previous s tudies have established that racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare are in part a result of differential access to care and differing socio economic conditions. However, previous research has also established that when these differences are accounted for, race and ethnicity remain significant predictors of the quality of healthcare received (Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Understandin g and Eliminating Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care , 2003 ). Figure 47. Percent healthcare satisfaction by race/ethnicity (Healthy Chicago Survey, 2017 ) 76 68 676069 White Black/African AmericanAsian or Pacific IslanderHispanic/ LatinxChicagoCOMMUNITY INPUT - The majority of focus groups that discussed healthc are access gave examples of the difficulties they encountered when trying to access a location where needed healthcare services are provided, including a lack of reliable transportation services, limited availability of local providers accepting public benefits, and overall provider shortages. Quotes from community residents included: \"Patients need to have access to healthcare financially, geographically, and logistically.\" (NAMI Chicago - Family) \"I was going to physical therapy and the transportation company blew me off a few times and so my physical therapy got canceled.\" (Housing Forward) \"I had a friend who fell sick and she couldn't get an appointment for two months and couldn't pay bill without insurance and she couldn't take care of kids.\" (Asian Human Services Family Health Center) \"My primary care physician was a two and half month wait to get an appointment to get into there. It was for pressing matters. I needed some x-rays, a MRI, a prostate exam, but it is such a process just to get in there .\" (Housing Forward) |Page 53 Perceptions of discrimination in healthcare have been associated with several outcomes among patients of color including decreased use of preventative healthcare , delayed use of prescription medication and medical tests, and worse chronic disease management and outcomes (Hausmann et al., 2008; Trivedi & Ayanian, 2006; Van Houtven et al., 2005). In addition, research has shown that persistent exposure to racism is traumatic for individuals and that trauma is an underlying root cause of many negative health outcomes. School- Based Health Services School -based health services are an important healthcare resource for young people in communities. According to the American Public Health Association (2018), the use of school -based health centers is associated with: Improved educational achievement and attainment including higher GPA, higher grade promotion, reduced suspension rates, and reduced non-com pletion rates Increased use of vaccination and preventive services Reduced asthma morbidity Reduced violence Fewer emergency department visits and hospital admissions Higher contraceptive use among females Improved prenatal care and higher birth weights Lower illegal substance use and alcohol consumption SCHOOL HEALTH ACCESS COLLABORATIVE - The School Health Access Collaborative (SHAC) is convened by the Public Health Institute of Metropolitan Chicago and Healthy Schools Campaign to bring together key stakeholders such as schools, students, families, and healthcare providers. The goal of the collaborative is to collectively work on improvements to the school health services infrastructure in Chicago and to increase student access to comprehensive, sustainable, and quality healthcare services. In 2018, the collaborative conducted a landscape analysis to determine the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities within the school health services system. The findings of the analysis are sum marized below : C APACITY AND RESOURCES : An overarching gap is the lack of resources and investment in school health services. The resources needed range from additional school staff or providers to funding for services. The need is so great that even schoo ls that have school -based health centers or established relationships with mobile providers do not have enough to match the service need. Furthermore, there is a need for consistent services throughout the year, including during summer. Frequent staff turnover create communication challenges related to coordinating healthcare services. COMMUNITY INPUT - People of color participating in focus groups frequently described themselves as receiving lower quality healthcare compared to whites. Some of the examples of disp arities in quality included: Poor provider communication including a lack of shared decision making Physician failure to provide surgical alternatives Negative remarks from physicians about a patient's ability to comply with recommendations even when they are making progress Delays in treatment for acute illnesses Multiple participants indicated that their previous experiences with providers made them reluctant to seek needed medical care, less likely to use preventative services, less likely to have a primary care provider, and much less likely to trust different providers in the future. |Page 54 MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: There are gaps in mental health services on the South and West sides . Students that experience ongoing stress and trauma need ongoing support. Often one social worker is shared by multiple schools . Additionally, funding for behavioral health often gets reduced because of budget cuts. SOCIAL AND STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH : Students are not experiencing education in a vacuum. Additional factors such as housing can impact the health and learning environment . Moreover, some schools and community areas may be over looked because they do not fall within certain data markers, which can result in certain communities being oversaturated and others not receiving services. DATA SHARING : Opportunities were identified around data collection, analysis, and sharing. Currently, the barriers to data collection and sharing are Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and the capacity required to manage and collect consistent and accurate data. Additionally, most hospital systems and electronic health records focus on adult health measures, not child and adolescent health , which further c omplicates the issue. A system that maintains all student health records could reduce redundancies and identify gaps . C OORDINATION OF SERVICES : Healthcare and school systems have complex organizational structures that can lead to inconsistent communications and duplication of services. The infrastructure for managing relationships between schools and providers is in the development phase because there are overlaps in services at some schools and other schools are not receiving any services. School champions can assist in coordination of services by maintaining relationships with parents, community partners, and healthcare partners and advocating for school -based health programs. CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS The definition of chronic disease varies widely in the United States and across the globe. However, chronic diseases are often defined as having the following characteristics (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2016; Bernell & Howard, 2016; CDC, 2019 ; Wor ld Health Organization ): Complex causality with multiple factors leading to onset including socioeconomics and health behaviors Long development period Prolonged course of illness that often requires ongoing medical attention Non -communicable Cause functional impairment in daily activitie s or disability Worldwide and in the United States, chronic diseases are the leading causes of disability and death (CDC, 2019 ; World Health Organization ). In addition, chronic disease rates are accelerating globally across all socioeconomic classes (World Health Organization ). However, socioeconomic inequities have profound impacts on which populations and communities have the greatest burden of disease. Many of the socioeconomic inequities that are underlying root causes of chronic illness are explored in depth in the health inequities and social determinants of health section . As a result, this section will primarily focus on examining the burden of chronic diseases within Chicago . PREVENTION - Chronic conditions such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, mental illness, and HIV/AIDs account for 90 percent of the nation's $3.3 trillion in annual healthcare expenditures (CDC, 2019). Addressing the risk factors in childhood through early prevention and ongoing management can mitigate the onset and reduce the costly physical and socioeconomic burden of these chronic conditions in adulthood. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have identified four domains of chronic disease prevention: |Page 55 1. Epidemiology and surveillanc e: to monitor trends and track progress 2. Environmental approaches: to promote health and support healthy behaviors 3. Healthcare system interventions: to improve the effective delivery and use of clinical and other high - value preventive services 4. Community -clinical linkages: connections between community and clinical sectors to improve population health RISK FACTORS - A small number of common risk factors contribute to most of the main chronic diseases (World Health Organization ; Egger & Dixon, 2014; Illinois Department of Public Health ): Unhealthy diet Physical inactivity Tobacco use Stress and/or depression Maternal and infant health Poverty and other social and structural determinants of health Many of these risk factors are present in childhood and adolescents - Chicago youth report unhealthy dietary habits and low incidence of daily physical activity, among other risk factors for chronic disease ( Table 7). Risk factors for youth begin early - before birth and in early childhood. For example, smoking during pregnancy increases the risk for low birth weight (CDC , 2019 ). In Chicago, the highest rates of smoking in pregnancy and low birth weight are found on the South and West sides (Figure 48). Low birth weight is associated with increased risk of hypertension , cardiovascular disease, and diabetes in adulthood (Ferrie, Langenberg, Shipley, & Marmot , 2006) . Smoking during pregnancy also increases the risk of childhood asthma (Neuman, et al., 2012). Table 7. Self-reported risk factors for adolescents (Youth Risk Surveillance Survey (YRBS), 2017 ) Chicago (2017) Illinois (2017) United States (2017) Did not eat vegetables at least once a day 50% n/a n/a Did not eat breakfast all 7 days of the week 76% n/a 65% Were not physically active (60 minutes) on all 7 days of the week 81% 77% 74% Screen time - video games or computer more than 3 hours a day 41% 42% 43% 13% (current) suicide 12% 10% 7% *The 2018 Illinois Youth Survey found higher current rates of e-cigarette use among adolescent respondents in the 12-15 percent range in Chicago and Suburban Cook County. (Illinois Youth Survey, 2018) |Page 56 Asthma Although asthma occurs in all racial and ethnic groups, low-income communities and communities of color share a disproportionate burden of asthma morbidity and mortality (Forno & Celed\u00f3n, 2012). In the City of Chicago, black/African American children and adolescents are five times more likely to visit the emergency department for an asthma -related condition than white children and adolescents (Figure 49). Previous research indicates that issues such as poverty, limited access to healthcare, exposure to violence, chronic stress, overcrowded housing, deteriorating infrastructure, poor housing conditions, and higher rates of air pollution all contribute to the increased burden of asthma morbidity and mortality in certain communities (William s, Sternthal, & Wright, 2009b). The inequities related to asthma outcomes are evident when viewing maps of ED visits for adults and children. Asthma -related emergencies are concentrated in low-income communities of color in the West and South regions of the city and county (Figure 50). Figure 48. Distribution of percent of births where mother smokes any cigarettes during pregnancy (left) and low birthweight rate (right) (Chicago Health Atlas) Figure 49. Age-adjusted asthma ED visits for children under 18 years old in Chicago (Respiratory Health Association, 2018) All race -ethnicities Black/African American Hispanic/Latinx White 050100150200250300 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015|Page 57 These inequities align with the Child Opportunity Index (COI) and highlight the disparities evident in communities with low and very low COI (Figure 51). The rates of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations increase as the opportunity decreases. Racial/ethnic disparities also exist in ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma. Hispanic/Latinx youth were hospitalized at more than twice the rate of whites and Asians, while black/African American youth were hospitalized at rates more than 4 times greater (Figure 51). Figure 51. ED visits and hospitalization rates per 100,000 with asthma diagnosis 0-19 years old in Chicago by COI (left) and by race/ethnicity (right ) (Illinois COMPdata, 2016 -2018) 01500300045006000 2016 2016 2017 2018White Black/AA Hispanic/Latinx Asian COMMUNITY INPUT - Quotes from community residents that participated in focus groups demonstrate the tremend ous toll that asthma is having on their well -being and the well -being of their families. \"I can't keep count of how many times I go to the ER with my child.\" \"I always take my child to the ER. As he gets older, it's has gotten more severe, and he is agitated. He asks questions about when he can stop taking medications.\" \"My child takes a lot of medication. At night he gets frustrated and says, 'here we go again.' He takes sleep apnea medication plus 2-3 medications for asthma.\" \"I'm running on no sleep because my child can't sleep at night. Then the hospital gives him medication to knock him right out - and then I have to carry him off the bus. He's 69 pounds. Give me the medication so I can give it to him at home, so I can get a break. Let me take a shower and straighten stuff up. You can't take a break, it's your child, you do what you have to do.\" Figure 50. Age-adjusted asthma ED visit rates per 10,000 in Chicago among children under 18 years old (Illinois COMPdata, 2015- 2017) |Page 58 Complex Chronic Conditions Complex Chronic Conditions (CCC) are generally health conditions that involve multiple morbidities or a higher degree of medical complexity, which requires treatment f rom various healthcare providers and specialists beyond that which is required in childhood generally . These conditions can include chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition s. Examples include the following categories: neurologic and neuromuscular (e.g., muscular dystrophies, cerebral palsy), respiratory (e.g., cystic fibrosis), hematologic or immunologic (e.g., sickle cell disease), cardiovascular, and urologic, gastrointestinal ( e.g., Croh n's disease), metabolic, malignancy, and other congenital or genetic defect. Individuals with CCC can present with functional limitations and disabi lities oftentimes requiring technological support - children with special healthcare needs account for a large amount of healthcare spending with almost half of the 13.3 million children covered by Medicaid or another form of public insurance (Musumeci & Chidambaram, 2019). In Chicago, hematological -immunological CCC rates are the highest at 457.1 per 100,000 Chicago youth 0-19 years old, followed by technology dependent, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular disease, and neuro -muscular in the top five categories (Figure 52). ED visits and hospitalizations have remained relatively stable for patients 0- 19 years old diagnosed with CCC in Chicago over the last few years (Figure 53). Figure 52. ED visits and hospitalization rates per 100,000 for CCC by condition 0-19 years old in Chicago (Illinois COMPdata, 2016- 2018) Figure 53.

Although the disparity between the levels is less marked , rates in Very Low COI communities are over 75 percent higher than Very High COI communities from 2016 to 2018 (Figure 54). Racial disparities are the greatest for black/African American youth in Chicago with rates at least 1.4 times great than whites and almost twice that of Asians (Figure 54). Obesity Obesity in the United States is a well- established public health crisis. Of the leading causes of death in the U.S., obesity is a risk factor for seven out of the top 10: heart disease, cancer, pulmonary disease, stroke, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and kidney disease (Behrens, Matthews, Moore, Hollenbeck, & Ebrahim, Mark, 2009; National Center for Health Statistics, 2016; Wang, Chen, Song, Caballero, & Cheskin, 2008). Childre n and youth with obesity or overweight have increased risk for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and other cardiovascular abnormalities; pre-diabetes and Type 2 diabetes; sleep apnea; gall bladder disease; musculoskeletal abnormalities and injury; and adverse mental health outcomes related to social isolation, bullying, and low self- esteem (Daniels et al., Paulis, Silva, Koes, & Middelkoop, 2014). Obesity and overweight in youth also increases the risk of adult obesity/overweight and the subsequent adverse health outcomes (Freedman et al., 2005; Whitaker, Wright, Pepe, Seidel, & Dietz, 1997). According to t he National Center for Health Statistics (2014), youth obesity has tripled since the seventies (Fryar, Carroll & Ogden, 2014). Between 2003 and 2012, overweight or obesity in youth 2-19 years old hit a plateau, remaining steady at 31.8 percent\u2014 with obesity for this age group at 16.9 percent (Ogden, Carroll, Kit, & Flegal, 2014). Almost one out of every three youth is overweight or obese and at risk for potentially severe and lifelong disease. Childhood obesity in Illinois outpaces the national average across age ranges and data sources. Illinoisans 10-17 years old have rates of obesity at 16.2 percent compared to the national average of 15.8 percent placing Illinois as the 17th worst in the nation (National Survey of Children's Health, 2016 -17). Illinois ranks 14th for children 2 to 4 years old who receive WIC benefits with obesity rates at 15.2 percent compared to the national average of 14.5 percent (Pan et al., 2016). Figure 54. ED visits and hospitalization rates per 100,000 with CCC diagnosis by COI (left) and race/ethnicity (right) 0-19 years old in Chicago (Illinois COMPdata, 2016 -2018) 0100020003000 2016 2017 2018 Very High Low0100020003000 2016 2017 2018White Black/AA Hispanic/Latinx Asian|Page 60 According to the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (2017) , obesity rates for high school students in Chicago rose by nearly 25 percent between 2013 and 2017 (Figure 55). Sixty -two percent of Chicagoans considered childhood obesity to be a big problem facing child and adolescent health in the city, making the second most common issue that Chicagoans identified (HCS- Jr., 2017) . Figure 56 illustrates the disparity in obesity and overweight rates for Chicago Public Schools students in Kindergarten, 6 th and 9th grades between community areas. The highest rates of obesity and overweight are on the West and Southwest sides of Chicago - generally aligning with the Child Opportunity Index . Based on findings from the Healthy Chicago Survey, Jr, Chicago parents have expressed a number of challenges to healthy eating for their kids including: Time for sit-down family meals (36%) Cost of healthy foods (33%) Time it takes to prepare healthy foods (26%) Convenience of fast foods (24%) MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH In 2016, one in six U.S. children 2-8 years old (17.4 percent ) had a diagnosed mental, behavioral, or developmental disorder (Cree et al., 2018). According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), at least one in five adolescents have or will have a serious mental or behavioral health condition. Chicago prevalence data for youth mental health disorders is limited. It is estimated that over 30 percent of Chicago high school students experience depression and over 5 percent reported attempting suicide in the past 12 months (YRBS, 2017). The causes of mental health disorders are complex and interrelated and there are gaps in the system to address and treat. The following are common findings from existing collaborative assessments, secondary data, and primary data collected through the Collaborative CHNA process distilled into key points related to mental health and substance use disorders for youth and families in Chicago. Trauma and Childhood Adversity Trauma can disrupt normal child development, interfere with learning, exacerbate mental health symptoms, and lead to long- term medical h ealth issues. Currently there are no accurate estimates of the prevalence of traumatized children in Illinois. Trauma can result from adverse experiences. Due to resilience and protecti ve Figure 55. Percent students with obesity (BMI >= 95th Percentile) in Chicago (YRBS, 2011 -2017) 0510152025 2011 2013 2017Confidencet Interval Percentage Figure 56. Distribution of overweight and obesity for Chicago Public School Kindergarten, 6th and 9th grade students by community area 2011- 2012 (Healthy Chicago , 2013) |Page 61 factors, not all children exposed to adverse events will become traumatized. The Illinois Department of Public Health reports results from a 2013 survey where one in seven Illinois adults say they encountered at least four categories of adverse childhood experiences (ACE s) prior to age 18 years . Hispanics /Latinx and black/African Americans report a higher incidence of ACEs (one in five) than whites (one in eight ). Risk for negative behavioral, medical and academic outcomes increases with trauma exposure. Several subgroups of children are at high risk for trauma. Children who have been abused and neglected or exposed to domestic violence are at risk of developing trauma- related effects. The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) served 21,483 youth in 2017 - those children are at risk of various trauma- related outcomes. Similarly, youth in juvenile detention centers report a high rate of exposure to adverse events . In a study by Cook County Juvenile Detention Center , over 90 percent of youth reported exposure to at least one adverse event, with an average of six events resulting in a high risk of trauma. These numbers illustrate a clear need to incorporate trauma measures into clinical assessments and treatment of children and youth (Illinois Children's Mental Health Partnership, 2017). Research is re vealing how exposure to trauma and adversity puts individuals at greater risk for mental illness, substance use disorder, and chronic illness across the lifespan. Trauma and adversity disproportionately affect communities of color and sexual and gender minorities , and are particularly prevalent among justice -involved populations, making addressing trauma a priority for achieving health equity (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014). Fragmentation of Services and Integration of Care National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI ) of Chicago's \"Roadmap to Wellness: Reframing the Mental Health Conversation for Chicago\" explicitly makes the case for an understanding of mental health that is inclusive of all people and is \"seen as primary healthcare \" (NAMI Chicago, 2019). \"Mental health\" is often detached from a general concept of wellness in a way that \"cardiac health,\" for example, is not. As a result, mental health services are often provided in a distinct, stigmatized silo that is not subject to the same demand for quality as most other healthcare sectors. A common theme in mental health system is fragmentation \u2014gaps, bottlenecks, and silos within and between types of providers and health plans and between various state agencies responsible for health and human services. The physical, operational, and financial separation of mental health from general healthcare creates barriers to timely access to necessary services for individuals and families and interferes with population health approaches that depend on seamless connec tions between various services. Children with mental health needs become involved in multiple systems. It is not uncommon for the same child to be served by mental health, education, and healthcare systems, not to mention child welfare and juvenile justice. Research has demonstrated that integrating primary and ment al healthcare can improve access to care and outcomes related to physical and mental health (Collins, Hewson, Munger, & Wade, 2010; Scharf et al., 2014). Integrated care models prioritize social determinants of health that interfere with and engage with treatment plans. Across C ook County, efforts toward integr ating primary and mental health care are underway, from county -wide care coordination strategies to neighborhood partnerships. At the state level, Illinois' Behavioral Health Transformation Plan presents opportunities to strengthen and replicate these local projects. Illinois entered into a consent decree in 2018, requiring Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services to reform the children's mental health system for Medicaid -eligible youth. |Page 62 Social and Structural Determinants of Health Social factors, especially housing, but also poverty, education, employment, food security, interpersonal relationships, and transportation , affect mental health status and access to mental health and substance use services. Yet social needs are inadequately assessed and addressed in most healthcare settings. Stigma and Discrimination Assessments of mental health needs in Chicag o indicate that stigma and discrimination against people with mental illness and substance use disorder persists in communities, schools, workplaces, and even in healthcare settings. Stigma deters people from seeking treatment before a crisis, and the expe rience of discrimination discourages ongoing engagement with treatment. Workforce Shortages and Gaps in Training Community residents and referring medical providers report barriers to access due to menta l health professional shortages and low reimbursemen t rates , stifling the potential for workforce growth. Shortages of pediatric mental health providers is particularly severe in Cook County with only 15 child and adolescent psychiatrists per 100,000 children under 18 years old (American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry). Core components of integration models, such as outreach and engagement and communication between providers, are not reimbursed under fee-for-service nor are the full costs covered by most managed care and per-member -per-month care coordination payment arrangements (Gerrity, 2016). Collaborative C HNA data (secondary data, community input, and stakeholder input) shows that progress toward integrated care and community well-being still faces formidable barriers in Chicago communities. Shortages of mental health and substance use treatment professionals in the community exacerbate an overreliance on institutions, including jails and prisons, for initiation of treatment. Priority Populations Mental health plays a role in the lives of all kinds of people and communities, but certain populations are impacted more severely or experience inequities due to structural factors including trauma, racism, and poverty. The following groups were identified as priority populations for community respon ses to mental health needs: Children's needs are distinct from adults and require specific systems to support their mental health in their homes, schools, and communities Black/African Americans and Native Americans who have the highest rates of mental illness LGBTQ+ individuals who are two or more times more likely to have a mental health condition and who have reported feeling unwelcome in many healthcare settings Immigrants who encounter linguistic and cultural barriers to care, and cite fear that access ing services or public aid may endanger themselves or their families L ow -income individuals who struggle to afford out-of-pocket expenses and are vulnerable to changes in program funding and closures of public mental health centers Individuals in the just ice population who, despite their extremely high rates of mental illness and substance use disorder and nearly universal eligibility for Medicaid under the ACA, frequently fall through the cracks when transitioning from correctional facilities to the commu nity (TASC Inc., 2016) People who have experienced trauma and at greater risk for depression, substance use disorder, and chronic disease, and are also more likely to forgo care if it is offered in settings that do not implement trauma- informed approaches (National Council for Behavioral Health; Stillerman) Children with intellectual or developmental disabilities who have higher rates of mental health disorders |Page 63 Utilization of Emergency Care MENTAL ILLNESS - Mental health -related ED visits for youth in Chicago communities range from 24 per 10,000 to 76 per 10,000 ( Figure 57). As previously mentioned, ED admission rates in these communities are heavily influenced by socioeconomic inequities such as poverty , housing instability, food insecurity, and poor access to healthcare . These inequities are reflected in the COI disparities - communities with Very Low COI have the highest rates of ED visits and hospitalizations with a mental health diagnosis (Figure 58). Racial disparities are even greater with hospitalization rates for black/African American youth almost twice as high as white youth and as much as four times higher than Asian youth (Figure 58). COMMUNITY INPUT - Input from community focus groups and surveys provided strong evidence that mental health and substance use are key health issues across the entire geography of Chicago. Mental health, substance use, stress, and trauma were key topics of discussion in at least 80 percent of focus groups, across geography, age, and race/ethnicity. Focus groups discussed how behavioral health impacted the health of their communities. The major themes that emerged included: Prevalence of chronic stress among youth and adults in communities Lack of education among youth, adults, and public servants about mental illness and substance use disorders Difficulties accessing behavioral health treatment resulting from provider shortages, minimal community -based resources, stigma, poor health care coverage, financial cost, and policy issues Consequences of untreated conditions Impacts of abuse and other forms of trauma on behavioral health Focus group input showed that closure of mental health centers and community -based services and ongoing difficulty accessing behavioral health providers continues to be a top concern for Chicago communities. Exacerbating overall behavioral health provider shortages is an inadequate pool of providers who accept public insurance. Focus groups also described complex, often confusing, changes to Medicaid rules and the high cost and benefit gaps of private insurance as barriers to care. |Page 64 Figure 59 illustrates the distribution of ED visits and hospitalization rates by diagnosis type with substance use disorders the most prevalent . Following substance use is \"other diagnosis ,\" which includes mental disorders due to known physiological conditions, schizotypal, delusional, mood (affective) disorders, dissociative, stress- related, behavioral syndromes associated with physiological disturbances and physical factors, behavioral and emotional disorders with onset usually occurring in childhood and adolescen ce, and various other mental disorders .

ED visit rates range from 21 per 10,000 to 93 per 10,000 for Chicago children 10-17 years old (Figure 60). In Illinois, suicide rates increased among youth 10- 17 year s old from 2007 to 2015 with males having higher suicide rates (4.1 per 100,000) compared to females of the same age group (2.4 per 100,000) from 2013 to 2015 (IVDRS, 2018). SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS - Drug overdose deaths are on the rise in Chicago since 2012 (Figure 61). In addition, there have been marked increases in opioid overdose death s; however, the burden of opioid -related mortality is unevenly distributed across communities (Figure 62). EDs provide unique opportunities to screen patients, initiate evidence- based treatment, provide overdose prevention, and connect patients to ongoing community -based care. ED admission rates among youth for substance use disorders and alcohol use in Chicago (Figure 63) indicate a need for enhanced approaches to substance use treatment and prevention in several communities.

Substance use ED visit rates per 10,000 in 10-17 years old in Chicago (Illinois COMPdata, 2015 - 2017) Community Input - In addition to bureaucratic and financial obstacles, focus groups explained that stigma and trauma are sometimes reinforced by providers who dismiss behavioral health patients' complaints of physical symptoms. Participants conveyed that more education about mental illness and substance use is needed for community members, health care professionals, and public officials. Focus group participants linked chronic stress to several different health effects. Community members reported that stress impacted their ability to cope with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and could disrupt their ability to engage in behaviors such as healthy eating and exercise. Parents caring for children with asthma and caregivers for older adults reported that the stress of caring for a family member had negative impacts on their mental and physical well -being. Youth living with asthma reported that stress was a trigger for their asthma attacks. Individuals living with mental illness or a substance use disorder from two different focus groups mentioned that stress negatively impacts their recovery process. Participants from three focus groups direc tly linked chronic stress to the development of substance use disorders. Among community input survey respondents: 50 percent ranked \"Access to health care & mental health services\" as one of \"the three most important things necessary for a 'Healthy Community'\" 40 percent selected \"Mental health\" as one of \"the three most important health problems in your community,\" and 30 percent selected \"Substance Use\" |Page 67 UNINTENTIONAL INJURY AND VIOLENCE Unintentional Injury Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death among children and adolescents in Illinois and the U.S. Unintentional injuries include suffocation, drowning, poisoning, fires, falls, motor vehicle crashes, and occupational injuries (Illinois Department of Public Health, 2019; CDC, 2016). The two pediatric age groups with the highest unintentional injury death rates are infants ( 1 year old) and adolescents 15-19 years old. Infants had a 46 percent increase in unintentional injury death rate between 1999- 2015, exceeding the death rates of adolescents 15-19 years old beginning in 2007 (Ballesteros, et al., 2018). There has been a recent increase in unintentional injury deaths among adolescents nationwide after many years of decreasing death from injuries. Among youth 10-19 years old, deaths attributable to unintentional injury declined steadily between 1999 and 2013 (from 20.6/100,000 to 10.6/100,000) ; however , the rate increased by 13 percent between 2013 and 2016 (up to 12.0/100,000) (Curtin, et al., 2018 ). Unintentional injuries are also a major cause of emergency department visits, hospitalization, and permanent disability among children and adolescents. The CDC estimates that for every child who dies from an unintentional injury, there are an additional 900 children treated in the emergency department (CDC, 2016). In addition, unintentional injuries are a major contributor to infant mortality each year in Chicago and in Illinois. Unintentional in juries resulting in death or non-fatal injuries disproportiona tely affect particular groups by sex, race/ethnicity, disability, geography, and socioeconomic status. Black/African American children and adolescents have a disproportionate burden of unintentional injuries with increased risk for drowning, pedestrian injuries, falls, and suffocation/ sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUID) (Children's Safety Network, 2017; Briker, et al., 2019). Boys have higher death and hospitalization rates due to unintentional injuries, including motor vehicle traffic, falls, drowning, and suffocation/SUID , compared to girls (Briker, et al., 2019; Ballesteros, et al., 2018; Safe Kids Worldwide, 2017; Curtin, et al., 2018; Children's Safety Network, 2017) . American Indian and Alaskan Native children and adolescents experience high uninten tional injury death rates and are more susceptible to death from motor vehicle traffic injuries among infants (Ballesteros, et al., 2018; Children's Safety Network, 2017). Children and adolescents with disabilities, particularly physical disabilities, are at increased risk of unintentional injuries compared to their counterparts without disabilities (Shi, et al., 2015; Children's Safety Network, 2017). |Page 68 In Chicago, the rates of ED visits and hospitalization for unintentional injury vary by COI - but unlike other ED and hospitalization data presented previously, the rates are not directly related to COI. For example, ED visit and hospitalization rates for unintentional injury are higher in communities with Moderate COI than in communities with Low COI (Figure 64). Racial and ethnic disparities , however, are evident but less marked than other data presented. ED visit and hospitalization rates for black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx and white youth in Chicago are relatively similar; however, Asian youth in Chicago have rates approximately one-third lower than their counterparts (Figure 64). Figure 65 depicts ED visits and hospitalization rates for unintentional injury by type of injury - falls are the leading cause of unintentional injury in Chicago youth. Other includes injuries related to fire/hot object s, motor vehicle traffic, pedal cyclist and pedestrian . Within Chicago, there are several types of unintentional injury that have highly concerning negative impacts on community health, and this CHNA includes data related to SUID and sleep -related death, water -related injuries and drowning, motor vehicle relate d injuries, and falls.

A recent study identified 221 sudden unexpected infant deaths (SUIDs) in Chicago between 2011 and 2015 (Roehler, et al., 2018 ). Among sleep -related infant deaths in Cook County in 2015 -2016, the majority of deaths took place on the South and West sides of Chicago (Figure 66) (Briker, et al., 2019). MOTOR VEHICLE RELATED INJURIES - Nationwide, motor vehicle related injury is the leading cause of unintentional injury death among children and adolesc ents; however, in Chicago, motor vehicle related deaths are a smaller proportion of injury deaths (Roehler, et al., 2018; Ballesteros, et al., 2018; CDC). Nonetheless, in Chicago, many children and adolescents involved in motor vehicle crashes sustain very serious but non-fatal injuries. Child passengers: A recent study conducted by researchers at our Stanley Manne Children's Research Institute found that between 2011 -2015, 324 young children (under 8 years old) not using a child safety seat sustained \"incapacitating\" injuries in motor vehicle crashes across Cook County, and seven children died (Figure 67). Child/ adolescent pedestrians: In Chicago, childr en 18 and under are more likely to experience a pedestrian injury (146.6 per 100,000) than adults (117.3 per 100,000) (Koopmans, et al., 2015). WATE R-RELATED INJURIES AND DROWNING - Since 1999, the number of unintentional drowning deaths among children and adolescents 18 years and under has decreased; however, drowning remain a serious issue as it is the leading cause of unintentional injury death among children 1-4 years old (Ballesteros, et al., 2018; Safe Kids Worldwide, 2015). Half of all patients treated FIGURE 67. Motor vehicle crashes in Chicago resulting in fatal or incapacitating injury to a child passenger not restra ined in a child safety seat (restrained by a seatbelt or unrestrained), 2011 -2015 (Modified from Salow, Simon, & Sheehan, 2019) Figure 66.

FALLS, INCLUDING WINDOW FALLS - In the United States, falls are the leading cause of non-fatal injuries for all children 18 and under. These injuries result from activities such as climbing on furniture, playing on playgrounds , falling down stairs , and playing near unsecured window s. Nationwide and in Chicago , falls are the leading cause of emergency department visits among children under 15 with approximately 8,000 visits to the ED per day nationwide (Ballesteros, et al., 2018; Safe Kids Worldwide, 2017; Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, 2018). According to the CDC there are, on average, 275,000 children who suffer traumatic brain injuries from falls each year. In Chicago, the rate of window falls among children younger than 5 decreased by 50 percent between 2002 and 2016 as a result of Stop the Falls , a multi -stakeholder window fall preve ntion campaign led by Lurie Children's experts . RISK FACTORS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES - Recent literature has identified factors and findings that increase the risk of experiencing different types of unintentional injuries and related deaths among children and adolescents: S leep -related death (SUIDs) (Briker, et al., 2019): o SUIDs most often occur in younger infants, with a recent study finding the median age in Cook County to be 2 months. o SUIDs disproportionately affect black/African American infants (65 percent of sleep -related infant deaths in Cook County in 2015- 2016). o Sleeping risk factors, such as co-sleeping and sleeping on the stomach, were present in 72-89 percent of SUIDs cases in Cook County. Drowning (Safe Kids Worldwide, 2015, CDC) o The unintentional drowning death rate is highest among children ages 1 to 4, and swimming pools are the most common site. Studies have shown that participation in formal swimming lessons is associated with substantial reduction (88 percent) in the risk of drowning among children 1-4 years of age (Brenner et al., 2009) . o African -American/black children have the highest rate of drowning fatalities . Black children 5-14 years old drown at three times the rate of white children. o American Indian/Alaska Native children have the second highest rate of drowning fatalities . Motor vehicle related deaths and injuries (Salow, et al., 2019): o N ationwide, 73 percent of child motor vehicle related fatalities were passengers, 21 percent were pedestrians, and 4 perce nt were cyclists. o Among child passengers 0-8 years old in Cook County who experienced incapacitating or fatal injuries in a crash, 62 percent were not using a child safety seat (13 percent unrestrained and 49 percent inappropriately restrained with a seat belt). o Nearly half of crash injuries occur within five miles from place of residence. In Chicago, three ZIP codes on the South side (60620, 60621, 60628) accounted for 11 percent of unrestrained fatalities and injuries among children 8 and under. Falls (Safe Kids Worldwide, 2017; Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago, 2018) o Falls are the leading cause of unintentional injury in youth with the largest proportion of injury in children 4 years old and under . o Males are more likely than females to die from fall-related injuries; a recent window fall study in Chicago conducted by Lurie Children's found that 69 percent of window falls were in boys . o Children are twice as likely to be suffer a fall-related injury at home than in a childcare facility . |Page 71 Child Maltreatment Child maltreatment is a form of violence or harm, intentional or unintentional, committed by a parent or caregiver against an infant, child or adolescent. There are four types of maltreatment that include (1) physical abuse, (2) emotiona l or psychological abuse, (3) sexual abuse and (4) neglect. Generally, children under the age of 4 years old, children with special needs and children in low-resource communities are especially vulnerable (CDC, 2019 ). Lack of parenting and child developmen t knowledge, parental stress, and social isolation are risk factors for child maltreatment (CDC, 2019 ). The impact of child abuse and negle ct can be felt into adulthood affecting health and well-being across the lifespan (Felitti et al., 1998) . Nurturing parenting sk ills, access to social services and supportive communities reduce childhood risk of abuse . Other social determinants of health (e.g., stable housing, access to healthcare, financial stability) are also protective factors (CDC, 2019 ). In Chicago, the number of ED visits and hospitalization s for child maltreatment related injuries between 2016 and 2018 for children 0-14 years old are relatively similar across age groups , with rates for adolescents 15-19 years old at least 30 percent lower (Figure 68). Across all age groups there has been an increase in ED visits and hospitalizations between 2016 and 2018, ranging from 11.8 percent for 0-4 years to as much as 24.1 percent for 5-9 years old. The ris k factor of low-resource communities is evident in the Chicago ED visit and hospitalization rates with the communities with Low and Very Low COI having the highest rates (Figure 69). These rates have remained relatively steady between 2016 and 2018 for the Moderate, High and Very High COI communities, but have increased 15.9 percent and 32.3 percent for Very Low and Low COI, respectively. Racial and ethnic disparities exist beyond socioeconomics with the hospitalization rate for child maltreatment injury for Hispanic/Latinx children 1.7 to almost five times greater than white and Asian children, and the rate for black/African American youth 8.1 to 18.4 times greater (Figure 69). Approximately 10 percent of ED visits and hospitalizations for injuries related to child maltreatment ( 2016- 2018) were related to neglect and over 30 percent were due to physical abuse (Figure 70). The majority of maltreatment injuries were attributed to sexual abuse , accounting for over 50 percent of ED visits and hospitalizations. Figure 68.

Black/ African American residents in Chicago have the highest burden of homicide and firearm -related mortality (Figure 71). The root causes of community violence are multifaceted and include issues such as the concentration of poverty, education inequities, poor access to health services, mass incarceration, differential policing strategies, and generational trauma. Research has Figure 69.

In addition, exposure to violence in childhood has been linked to trauma, toxic stress, and an increased risk of poor health outcomes across the lifespan. Violence also has a negative impact on the socioeconomic conditions within communities that contribute to the widening of disparities. Research has long established that exposure to interpersonal and/or community violence is strongly linked to the development of mental illness, post -traumatic stress d isorder (PTSD), and substance use disorders. The following examples demonstrate the impact that exposure to violence can have on the behavioral health of children, youth, and adults: Youth who are exposed to interpersonal violence have a significantly higher risk for PTSD, major depression, and substance use disorders (Kilpatrick et al., 2003) . Women who experience intimate partner violence are three times more likely to have symptoms of depression, four times more likely to have PTSD, and six times more likely to have suicidal ideation (Houry, Kemball, Rhodes, & Kaslow, 2006; Prevention Institute, 2011 ). Thirty -five percent of urban youth exposed to community violence develop PTSD, compared to 20 percent of soldiers deployed to combat areas in the last six years (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, 2019) . Teen s who witness a stabbing are three times more likely to attempt suicide (Pastore, Fisher, & Friedman, 1996) . Teens who witness a shooting are twice as likely to abuse alcohol (Pastore et al., 1996) . Numerous studies have shown that violence not only affects behavioral health but physical health as well. In addition to the physical scars, acute injuries, and disabilities that often result from surviving a violent incident, exposure to violence increases an individual's risk for developing chronic diseases, increased hospitalizations and emergency department visits, and negative health behaviors. Examples include: Children of mothers experienc ing chronic intimate partner violence are at two times greater risk of developing asthma than children who are not exposed (Suglia, Enlow, Kullowatz, & Wright, 2009). Increased exposure to violence is linked to a higher number of days of significant asthma symptoms in children; the greater the exposure, the greater the number of symptomatic days (Wright et al., 2004). Adults who are exposed to violence as children have an increased likelihood of developing several different chronic health conditions such as ischemic heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes, and hepatitis (Carver, Timperio, & Crawford, 2008; Felitti et al., 1998). A dults exposed to intimate partner violence have an increased risk of developing chronic disease compared to those not exposed (Coker, Smith, Bethea, King, & McKeown, 2000; Shonkoff, Boyce, & McEwen, 2009). Individuals who have been exposed to interpersonal or community violence have a greater chance of developing negative health behaviors such as smo king, eating disorders, substance abuse, decreased physical activity, and poor sleep habits (Carver et al., 2008; CDC, 2008; Coker Stoc khammer, & Hood, 2002). Children of women who experience intimate partner violence are more likely to be obese than other children and the effect is higher for families living in unsafe neighborhoods (Kendall -Tackett & Marshall, 1999). |Page 74 Parents who perceive their neighborhood as unsafe are four times more likely to have overweight children than parents who perceive their neighborhood as safe (Burdette, Wadden, & Whitaker, 2006). People who described their neighborhood as unsafe are nearly three times more likely to be physically inactive than people who describe their neighborhood as extremely safe (Johnson et al., 2009). Violence has profound direct and indirect impacts on health in communities, and violence can have broader socioeconomic effects that furthe r impact the health of communities. Violence in communities has been associated with reduced investment in community resources such as parks, recreation facilities, and programs that promote healthy activity (Prevention Institute, 2011a). Food resources such as supermarkets are more reluctant to enter communities of color with higher rates of violence further reducing access to healthy foods (Odoms- Young et al., 2009; Zenk et al., 2005). Gun violence can significantly decrease the growth of new retail and service businesses, decrease the number of new jobs available, and slow home value appreciation (Irvin - Erickson et al., 2017). In addition, high rates of gun violence are associated with lower home values, credit scores, and home ownership rates (Irvin -Erickson et al., 2017). Historically, v iolent crime data in the Unites States have been difficult to assess due to differences in reporting standards and reliability of measurements between police jurisdictions. There is some limited ability to compare violent crime rates between community areas in Chicago (Table 8). It is clear that there are substantial geographic differences in violent crime rates between community areas , with the South and West sides of the city having the greatest burden of violent crime. Table 8.

When overlaying other types of crime such as sexual assault, these same communities experience a higher concentration of violence and align with the areas of Low and Very Low COI (Figure 72). Figure 72. Distribution of violent crime in Chicago - crimes involving a firearm with outdoor location (top left), crimes involving firearm where victim survived (top right), sexual assault (bottom left) and composite map (bottom right) (Chicago Police Department, 2016) |Page 76 Families in Chicago recognize this continued burden of violence . Parents rated gun violence as the top social issue affecting children and adolescents in Chicago, with 87 percent considering gun violence a big problem (Healthy Chicago Survey, Jr., 2017). Chicagoans on the South and West sides reported the lowest percent (70 percent and below) of feeling safe in their neighborhood \"all of the time\" or \"most of the time\" compared to communities on the North side of Chicago (Figure 73). Within Chicago communities, violence continues to disproportionately affect young black males. In 2017, young black males were 13.7 times more likely to die from a firearm -related homicide than non-black males in Chicago (IVDRS, 2019). In Chicago among youth 0-19 year s old, black/African American youth experienced on average five times higher ED/hospitalization rates compared to white youth for an intentional injury from 2016 to 2018 (Figure 74). ED/hospitalization rates for intentional injuries were highest in communities of Low and Very Low COI (Figur e 74). Injuries due to unarmed fighting/bodily force/striking/biting comprised more than half (60 percent and up) of the injuries followed by firearm for Chicago youth 0-19 years old from 2016 to 2018 (Figure 75).

It can be physical, verbal, social, or through technology and can inflict physical, psychological, social, or education al harm on the targeted youth (National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2018) . Bullying increases a student's risk for emotional distress, self-harm , depression, anxiety, sleep difficulties, death, lower academic achievement, and dropping out of school (Ladd et al., 2017; National Center for Education Statistics, 2016) . Chicago parents rated bullying as the one of the top social issues facing youth in Chicago, with 76 percent of paren ts considering it a big problem (Healthy Chicago Survey, Jr., 2017). Bullying is also a common problem with approximately 20 percent of students between sixth and 12th grade reporting that they have been bullied at some point (National Center for Education Statistics, 2016) . However, some student populations report much higher rates of bullying, including students with physical or intellectual disabilities, students of color, and students who identify as or are perceived as LGBTQ+ ( Table 9). Table 9.

The most common ly mentioned safety issues were gun violence, gang activity, drug -related activities, burglaries, and armed robberies. Gun violence was mentioned as an issue across the city; however, it was most often mentioned by participants living on the South and West sides. The same geographic trend occurred in discussions about gang and drug -related activity. Burglaries and armed robberies were reported by focus group participants across the city's North, West, and South sides. Participants related that the prevalence of violence in their communities has led to health issues such as chronic stress, trauma and decreased mental well -being and decreased physical activity due to unsafe neighborhoods. Within community input surveys, respondents shared the importance of safety and low crime in their communities. Overall, 37 percent of resp ondents chose \"safety and low crime\" as one of the most important factors for a healthy community. Frequently, survey respondents recognized safety and low crime as one of the greatest strengths in the community. Safety and low crime was also the most ment ioned area for improvement by respondents. |Page 78 Summary of 2016 CHNA and 2017 -2019 Community Health Implementation Plan 2016 CHNA PRIORITIES Lurie Children's conducted a comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in 2015 and 2016. CHNA efforts were motivated by the desire to: (1) identify barriers to good health and well- being for Chicago children and adolescents; and (2) guide continuing efforts by Lurie Children's to improve child and adolescent health and well-being in Chicago, in partnership with individuals, programs, and organizations also dedicated to these objectives. Based on the findings of the CHNA and in collaboration with Lurie Children's subject matter experts and the Public Policy Committee (now the Policy, Advocacy and Community Engagement Committee) of Lurie Children's Board , the CHNA Committee developed the 2017 -2019 Community Health Implementation Plan (CHIP). The full Progress Report (Appendix D) provides an update on Lurie Children's progress in achieving the metrics and activities outlined as of June 2019. The Implementa tion Plan focuses on the eight priority areas identified in the 2016 CHNA: (1) social determinants of health; (2) access to care; (3) asthma; (4) child maltreatment; (5) complex chronic conditions; (6) mental health; (7) obesity, physical activity and nutr ition; and (8) violence -related injury and mortality. The first two priorities \u2014 social determinants of health and access to care \u2014 are overarching themes of the subsequent priority health conditions and the Child Opportunity Index (COI) is the lens throug h which health inequities are viewed. REVIEW OF 2017 -2019 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN PROGRESS Lurie Children's experts made significant progress in the implementation of activities and potential activities in each of the eight priority areas identified in the CHN A. Highlights include: Strengthened Infrastructure to Amplify Synergies and Impact Formed Lurie Children's Healthy Communities to advance and align the community facing efforts of our clinical and public health experts. With oversight from the Policy, Advo cacy and Community Engagement Committee of the Lurie Children's Board of Directors, the team developed a Strategic Plan to support the Medical Center's Vision 2025 with a focus on improving health equity for Chicago's children. Received a $12 million gift from an anonymous donor to support efforts to address three of the related priority areas identified in the CHNA: child maltreatment, mental health, and violence. The funded projects include developing innovative technology to identify child abuse, helping youth break the cycle of violence, training school personnel how to recognize trauma and intervene effectively, and enhancing research and evaluation efforts in the three focus areas. Built Collaborative Partnerships & Coalitions Joined West Side United, a group of hospitals working together on economic vitality, population health and community initiatives to improve the health of those who live on Chicago's West side. B egan housing the Illinois Children's Mental Health Partnership and the Illinois Child hood Trauma Coalition within Lurie Children's Center for Childhood Resilience. Implemented the Juvenile Justice Collaborative demonstration project, a care coordination model for justice- involved youth. In the JJC's pilot year, no youth connected to servic es was re-arrested during their participation in the program. |Page 79 Mobilized Policy & Advocacy Efforts Convened a statewide Collaborative for Children's Health Policy by partnering with several organizations to develop and advance policies that will improve child and adolescent health and well- being. Continued collaboration with the Illinois Gun Violence Prevention Coalition to support passage of the Combating Illegal Gun Trafficking Act (PA 100-1178), which was signed into law in 2019. Worked with Senator Dick Durbin to develop and pass provisions in the SUPPORT For Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6) in 2018 to help children exposed to trauma by increasing federal mental health funding and coordination across agencies. Expanded Trainings & Education Center for Childhood Resilience trained 3,000+ partners in trauma- informed practices and social- emotional learning. Strengthening Chicago's Youth hosted 37 educational opportunities attended by over 2,500 partners. Consortium to Lower Obesity in Chicago Children trained 700+ participants in health curricula. Partnered with Respiratory Health Association to provide asthma education in schools to 349 students and 318 school staff. The Smith Child Health Evaluation Core trained 175 partners on topics related to program evaluation. W orkforce Development provided 500+ internships, including 43 to youth in the Supporting Adolescents with Independent Life Skills program. 2016 CHNA WRITTEN FEEDBACK Lurie Children's did not receive written feedback on the 2016 CHNA. |Page 80 Conclusion SUMMARY OF 2019 NEEDS IDENTIFIED Lurie Children's Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) combined the Alliance for Health Equity's Collaborative CHNA, public health data, community input, existing research, existing plans, and other existing assessments to document the health status of communities within Chicago and to highlight health inequities and disparities that are negatively impacting child health. The CHNA also provided insight into community -based assets and resources that should be supported and leveraged during the implementat ion of health improvement strategies. The overarching goal of our community health strategy is to advance health equity for youth and their families - consideration of family context is a cross -cutting emphasis in our assessment. Based on the information provided in the CHNA, input from stakeholders and community input, five priority domains were identified for implementation planning: Addressing social determinants of health including addressing structural racism, advancing policies that promote health equity, creating safe and supportive environments , addressing housing stability and food access, and advancing community -driven decision making Improving access to care and community resources through interventions, programs, and policy and systems improvemen ts Improving mental and behavioral health, including substance use disorders Addressing the risk factors, prevention, and management of chronic health conditions , particularly focused on asthma, complex chronic conditions and obesity P reventing unintentional and violence -related injuries and mortality By implementing strategies and supporting existing work within the priority domains, Lurie Children's aims to promote health equity , reduce health disparities and improve the overall health and well- being of infants, children, adolescents and their families in Chicago . To be successful, Lurie Children's will continue to collaborate with the Alliance for Health Equity, community -based partners, various government agencies and Chicago youth and families. ADOPTION OF 2019 LURIE CHILDREN'S CHNA BY GOVERNING BODY Lurie Children's 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment was present to the Policy, Advocacy and Community Engagement Committee of the Lurie Children's Board of Directors on July 17, 2019.

The Implementation Plan focuses on eight priority areas identified in the most recent Community Health Needs Assessment ( CHNA ): (1) social determinants of health; (2) access to care; (3) asthma; (4) child maltreatme nt; (5) complex chronic conditions; (6) mental health; (7) obes ity, physical activity and nutrition; and (8) violence -related injury and mortality. OVERVIEW OF PROGRESS Lurie Children's experts made significant progress in the implementation of activities and potential activities in each of the eight priority areas identified in the CHNA. Highlights include: Strengthened Infrastructure to Amplify Synergies and Impact Formed Lurie Children's Healthy Communities to advance and align the community facing efforts of our clinical and public health ex perts . With oversight from the Policy, Advocacy and Community Engagement Committee of the Lurie Children's Board, the team developed a Strategic Plan to support the Medical Center's Vision 2025 with a focus on improving health equity for Chicago's children . Received a $12 million gift from an anonymous donor to support efforts to address three of the related priority areas identified in the CHNA : child maltreatment, mental health, and violence. The funded projects include developing innovative technology to identify child abuse, helping youth break the cycle of violence , training school personnel how to recognize trauma and intervene effectively , and enhancing research and evaluation efforts in the three focus areas . Built Collaborative Partnerships & Coalitions Joined West Side United , a group of hospitals working together on economic vitality, population health and community initiatives to improve the health of those who live on Chicago's West Side. Began housing the Illinois Children's Mental Health Partnership and the Illinois Childhood Trauma Coalition within Lurie Children's Center for Childhood Resilience . Implemented the Juvenile Justice Collaborative demonstration project, a care coordination model for justice-i nvolved youth . In the JJC's pilot year, no youth connected to services was re -arrested during their participation in the program. Mobilized Policy & Advocacy Efforts Convened a statewide Collaborative for Children's Health Policy by partnering with several organizations to develop and advance policies that will improve child and adolescent health and wellbeing . Continued collaboration with the Illinois Gun Violence Prevention Coalition to support passage of the Combating Illegal Gun Trafficking Act ( PA 100 -1178) ), which was signed into law in 2019 . Worked with Senator Dick Durbin to develop and pass provisions in the SUPPORT For Patients and Communities Act (H.R. 6 ) in 2018 to help children exposed to trauma by increasing federal mental health funding and coordination across agencies. Expanded Trainings & Education Center for Childhood Resilience trained 3,000+ partners in trauma-informed practices and social- emotional learning . Strengthening Chicago's Youth hosted 37 educational opportunities attended by over 2,500 partners . Consortium to Lower Obesity in Chicago Children trained 700+ participants in health curricula. Partnered with Respiratory Health Association to provide asthma education in schools to 349 students and 318 school staff. The Smith Child Health Evaluation Core trained 175 partners on topics related to program evaluation . Workforce Develo pment provided internships 500+ internships, including 43 to yout h in the Supporting Adolescents with Independent Life Skills program . Community Health Implementation Plan : 2018 Progress Report page 4 Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Plan Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospit al of Chicago conducted a comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in 2015 and 2016. CHNA efforts were motivated by the desire to: (1) identify barriers to good health and well -being for Chicago children and adolescents; and (2) guide continuing efforts by Lurie Children's to improve child and adolescent health and well -being in Chicago, in partnership with individuals, programs, and organizations also dedicated to these objectives. Details are outlined in the Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 . Based on the findings of the CHNA and in collaboration with Lurie Children's subject matter experts and the Public Policy Committee of Lurie Children's Board, the CHNA Committee developed the 2017 -2019 Community Health Implementation Plan . The first two priorities \u2014 social determinants of health and acce ss to care \u2014 are overarching themes of the subsequent priority health conditions and the Child Opportunity Index (COI) is the lens through whi ch health inequities are viewed. The COI is a measure of relative opportunity across neighborhoods (Figure 1) and provides a mean s of exploring social determinates of health for children. The index includes three sub -indices: Educational Opportunity Index, Health and Environmental Opportunity Index , and the Social and Economic Opportunity Index. Metrics that comprise the index can be found in Table 1 . More detailed information about the Child Opportunity Inde x can be found at www.diversitydatakids.org/files/CHILDOI/DOCS/DDK_KIRWAN_CHILDOI_OVERVIEW.pdf . Table 1.

COI by Chicago Community Area Community Health Implementation Plan : 2018 Progress Report page 5 For each of the priority health conditions \u2014 asthma, child maltreatment, complex chronic conditions, mental health, obesity, and violence \u2014 the Implementation Plan outlines age group(s) and populations at highest risk, current and potential activities, Lurie Children's Divisions/Programs involved, potential community partners, anticipated impact, and monitoring and evaluation plans . These details are outlined in the Community Health Implementation Plan . In early 2017, Lurie Children's Healthy Communities was created as a result of the CHNA process. It is designed to maximize the positive impact the medical center and its partners have on child health in the community. Healthy Communities builds on decades of Luri e Children's experts' successful public health outreach and leads the monitoring and evaluation of the Implementation Plan. The following is a progress report describing efforts to advance the priorities and activities of the Implementation Plan. The first two priorities - the overarching themes of this work - include summative highlights of our key partnerships and projects. Each of the subsequent priority health conditions includes a dashboard of rel evant data and key successes followed by a detailed table of activities and progress. Data Sources HOSPITALIZATION S AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS Hospitalization data, including emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient admissions, were obtained from the Illinois hospital discharge database, COMPdata, which is maintained by the Illinois Hospital Association. Hospitalization cases include Chicago children and adolescents of ages 0 -19 years who were discharged in calendar years 2016- 2018 , except where noted . Excluded cases were those who were deceased and those not living in Illinois. Rates were calculated using 2016 -2017 American Com munity Survey 1 -year estimates; 2017 American Community Survey 1 -year estimates were used as a proxy for 2018 population estimates. FOOD INSECURITY Food insecurity data was ob tained from the Greater Chicago Food Depository (GCFD). The GCFD has used the percent of the population living in households with incomes below 185% of the federal poverty level from the U.S. Census American Community Survey 5 -year estimates (2013 -2017) as a prominent standard data point in their assessment of risk of food insecurity. This data point has been widely used because it is a common income eligibility threshold for federal nutrition programs such as the National School Lunch Program and the Sp ecial Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). That said, this should not be interpreted as the actual number of those who experience food insecurity, since some households with incomes below 185% FPL are not food insecure, wh ile others above this income level are food insecure. CHICAGO YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY The Chicago Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) was completed in randomly selected public high schools in Chicago during the spring of 2017. The survey focuses on prior ity health -risk behaviors that result in the most significant mortality, disability, and social problems during both adolescence and adulthood. Questions cover nutrition, tobacco use, alcohol and other drug use, physical activity, injuries, and sexual behavior resulting in sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy. YRBS is one component of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in collaboration with representatives from state and local depa rtments of education and health, other federal agencies, and national education and health organizations. Community Health Implementation Plan : 2018 Progress Report page 6 PRIORITY AREA 1 - Social Determinants of Health Health and wellness are impacted by more than healthcare services and Lurie Children's is committed to addressing the social determinants of health - the conditions in the places where children are born, live, learn, and play. The following describes some of the initiatives Lurie Children's is working to advance that address these underlying and interconnected influencers of child health and health inequities. HOSPITAL COLLABORATIONS West Side United In May 2017, Lurie Children's was invited to join West Side United, a group of hospitals, funders, technical and community organizations working together on economic vitality, population health and community -driven initiatives to improve the health of individuals who live on the West Side of Chicago. The goal of this Collaborative is to coordinate the efforts each individual hospital is undertaking to maximize overall positive impact and improve health equity with the objective of lowering the 16 -year life expectancy gap between Chicago's Loop and the West Side. West Side United ( westsideunited.org ) was started by Rush University Medical Center as part of its CHNA and currently includes six hospitals/health systems. It is governed by the Leadership Council, on which Lurie Children's Matthew Davis, MD, MAPP serves as Secretary . The participating hospitals /health systems include: Rush University Medical Center, Lurie Children's, AMITA Health, Cook County Health, Sinai Health System and the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences Syst em. The West Side n eighborhoods include 10 community areas : Austin, Belmont Cragin, Near West Side, West Town, Lower West Side, East Garfield Park, West Garfield Park, North Lawnd ale, South Lawndale and Humboldt Park (Figure 2) . Figure 2. Illustration of West Side United communities Community Health Implementation Plan : 2018 Progress Report page 7 Over the past two years, the number o f West Side United partners has grown to over 50 non -profits , technical and business partners , government agencies and faith -based institutions, of which Lurie Children's is a leader in this work. Lurie Children's serves in leadership positions on the Anchor, Communications, Community Hiring/HR, and Food Access Committees and is actively engaged in the Operations, Education, Investments, Metrics, Procurement, and Career Pathways Committees. West Side United is focused on four priorities: health and healthcare, neighborhood and physical environment , economic vitality, and education (Figure 3) . These priorities include collective investment of $1.7 million in community development projects through l oans , $250,000 in grants to local organizations to add more community health workers and increase access to mental health services , and $85,000 in one -time capital grants to small businesses. West Side United hospitals provided over 400 high school internships to expose students to healthcare careers and started Career Pathways, a program for existing employees to become Medical Assistants. West Side United also d eveloped a strategic plan to address food insecurity that includes a fruits and vegetables vouc her program , increased nutrition education at schools , and s tronger ties betw een hospitals and food pantries. Alliance for Health Equity Lurie Children's is engaged in another hospital- community collaborative to improve population and community health thr ough collective impact. T he Alliance for Health Equity (allhealthequity.org ) is a partnership between the Illinois Public Health Institute, hospitals, health departments, and community organizations across Chicago and Cook County . As a member of the Steering Committee, in addition to membership on various workgroups (e.g., community safety, data, food access, housing, policy, trauma- informed care and social determinants of health ), Lurie Children's ensures t hat the pediatric perspective is well- represented . Chicago HEAL Initiative Lurie Children's is one of 10 Chicago hospitals to join forces with U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D -IL) to reduce violence as part of the Chicago Hospital Engagement, Action and Leadership (HEAL) Initiative . Senator Durbin launched the Chicago HEAL Initiative in October 2018 to bring together hospitals to make tangible commitments to reduce gun violence, heal the physical and mental trauma that violence inflicts on victims, increase well- paying jobs, and create other economic opportunities in the neighborhoods they serve. Healthcare Anchor Network In 2018, Lurie Children's became the third children's hospital in the country to join the Democracy Collaborative's Healthcare Anchor Networ k (www.healthcareanchor.network ), a group of hospitals and health systems committed to building more inclusive and sustainable local economies. This group shares innovative ideas and best practices to expand hospitals' role as anchor institutions by expand community hiring, procurement and investment opportunities. Figure 3. West Side United's Priorities Community Health Implementation Plan : 2018 Progress Report page 8 WORKFORCE EDUCATION To ensure that we can deliver healthcare that meets social, cultural and linguistic needs, we strive to have a workforce that mirrors the diversity of our patients. In addition, we proactively reach out to young people in under -resourced communities to ensure that they have access to opportunities in healthcare careers through Lurie Children's Workforce Education and Community Engagement . Through these opportunities, we provide over 200 internships annually and have hired m ore than 70 former interns into em ployment at Lurie Children's . NEIGHBORHOOD -BASED INITIATIVES One of Lurie Children's Healthy Communities ' top priorities is to invest in comprehensive multifaceted neighborhood -based initiatives to \"move the needle\" on child health issues, especially in un der-resourced and vulnerable communities where children's health is particularly compromised. Using emergency room, asthma, potential child maltreatment and mental health needs data, we identified one ZIP code \u2014 60639, which includes Belmont Cragin and Aus tin \u2014 as the neighborhoods that account for our largest patient volumes in each of these areas. Both communities also score on the lower end of the Child Opportunity Index (Belmont Cragin scores \"low,\" Austin scores \"very low\"). The Healthy Communities tea m is work ing with agencies and community leaders in Belmont Cragin to prioritize activities based on the neighborhood's Quality of Life Plan created in partnership with LISC Chicago and Northwest Side Housing Center (NWSHC) with input from 600 residents an d 30 local agencies. In 2018, a Community Outreach Specialist was hired by Lurie Children's to serve as a critical point of connection for the hospital and \"boots on the ground\" in Belmont Cragin . Lurie Children's has also secured a $1.25 million philanthropic gift to support this work starting in 2019. To d ate, we have provide d asthma education in schools (see Priority Activity 3 dashboard and Activity 3.08) and parenting education and support with a local community service provider (see Parenting Supports below). In addition, the Center for Childhood Resilience has conducted trainings on building resilience in refugee/immigrant children and families at Portage -Cragin Branch of Chicago Public Libraries and is leading a learning collaborative focuse d on trauma resilient & responsive s choo ls. We are working with NWSHC to coordinate a speaker series comprised of Lurie Children's clinicians and educators as part of their Parent University hosted at Steinmetz College Prep in Belmont Cragin . Topics have include d healthy nutr ition, parenting support/child development, bystander CPR, and injury prevention , including car seat distribution and installation. Adam Becker, PhD , and NWSHC received a joint seed g rant from the Alliance for Research in Chicagoland Communities (ARCC) within Northwestern University's Center for Community Health. The ARCC seed grant is supporting a community -based participatory research in Belmont Cragin. Lurie Children's Workforce Education team has expanded the Discovering Healthcare C areers interns hips to include students at S teinmetz College Prep and developed a new STEM program at ITW David Speer Academy . We have also sponsored various events within Belmont Cragin and Austin through Lurie Children's Community Volunteer Corp, includin g Chicago Cares' S erve-a- Belmont Cragin , and the Back -to-School Celebration with Chicago Public Schools for Austin and Belmont Cragin communities at Michele Clark High School. Concurrently, Lurie Children's participated in the development of Austin's Quality of Life Plan, which was led by LISC Chicago and Austin Coming Together and finalized in early 2019. Lurie Children's is continuing to work with community leaders in Austin to identify key needs and priorities that align with Lurie Children's expertise. Community Health Implementation Plan : 2018 Progress Report page 9 PARENTING SUPPORTS To strengthen and support Chicago parents in vulnerable communities, Lurie Children's experts are meeting parents where they are, and partnering with community and city organizations to ensure efficiency and sustainability. Lurie Children's Healthy Communities is supporting various initiatives with community and city - wide partners. Lurie Children's continues to partner with Metropolitan Family Services to strengthen and support their Parenting Fundamentals initiative. Parenting Fundamentals is an evidenced -based intervention that combines positive parenting classes with home visits and connection to supportive social services. This intervention has been shown to increase parenting knowledge and skills, increase supportive family environments, and reduce risk for child abuse. In early 2018, Lurie Children's Healthy Communities began a pilot to integrate healthcare practitioners into two Metropolitan Family Services' parenting classes in Belmont Cragin and Austin. Lurie Children's Healthy Communities social worker and advanced practice nurse - with over 40 years combined expertise in child development and clinical education - provid ed health -centered education to supplement the positive parenting curriculum. Lurie Children's Healthy Communities social worker and advanced practice nurse are also leading a pilot support group for parents focused on peer mentoring, self -care, and positive parenting with parents from Lurie Children's Chicago Youth Programs (CYP) Clinic. These parents are high -risk families from low -resource communities and the session s are parent -driven and focused on providing a safe space for parents to support one another and learn new techniques for self -regulation, positive parenting, and healthy interpersonal relationships. In 2018, Lurie Children's Healthy Communities hosted a Cigna Community Ambassador Fellow to lead an effort to leverage lessons learned from the pilot s with Metropolitan Family Services and CYP and collect community input to inform development of a parenting supports program . Pro gram design includes a tiered approach with introductory and targeted sessions, including referrals to community service providers. We are currently continuing to plan for pilot implementation in late 2019 in Belmont Cragin. Lurie Children's has formed a unique partnership with the Chicago Public Library (CPL) to further increase the number of parents exposed to positive parenting skill building and health education. N ew parents are significant users of the library system, both looking for parenting information and socializing with other new parents. Lurie Children's is working with CPL to integrate Lurie Children's health experts, including Community Medicine and Advoc acy (CMA) residents, social workers, APNs, nutritionists and others into library programming, particularly in under -resourced neighborhoods. A pilot bega n in spring 2018 at the Rogers Park and Uptown branches of CPL, and CMA residents continue to integrate health information into library programming. FOOD SECURITY AND HEALTH Food insecurity is the condition in which people cannot reliably access adequate nutritious food. Food insecurity is a complex, multi-faceted issue driven by a myriad of socioeconomic f actors and is particularly detrimental for children. Approximately 17% of children in Cook County , or 1 out of every 6, are food insecure. Lurie Children's Healthy Communities and Lurie Children's primary care clinic in the Uptown community , in collaborat ion with the Greater Chicago Food Depository, launched Chicago's first on -site food pantry in a pediatric clinic, serving families that identify as food insecure . In the program's first nine months, we screened 2,287 unique patient s using a standardized me asure; 4.5 percent (102 unique patients) were identified as food Community Health Implementation Plan : 2018 Progress Report page 10 insecure. To date, we have distributed 104 bags of healthy, shelf -stable fruits, vegetables, legumes, grains and cereal to 82 unique patient families. We are developing a pilot program with several clinical divisions to provide food to more families in need. Our planned intervention will have three components: a home food delivery program through which patient families can order food, paid for by the hospital through philanthropic support ; transportation support for families who need assistance getting to local food pantries; and a longer- term home- delivery strategy for families to purchase healthy foods and beverages. Community Health Implementation Plan : 2018 Progress Report page 11 PRIORITY AREA 2 - Access to Care Access to care is a key factor in child health equity, which extends beyond health insurance access. Lurie Children's is committed to addressing the barriers to and expanding the facilitators of access to care . This includes building community -clinic collaborations and strengthening partne rships with Federally -Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) ; advocacy efforts to ensure children's health is a consideration in policy and funding decisions ; and evaluation to ensure that we understand the landscape of child health in terms of health needs and community priorities. The following provides an overview of Lurie Children's efforts to advance this work. COMMUNITY -CLINIC COLLABORATIONS In 2019, Lurie Children's Healthy Communities hired a Director of Community -Clinic Collaborations to continue to build and strengthen partnerships with FQHCs, including managing our Community Benefit Grants . Since 2016, Lurie Children's has provided $ 675,000 in Community Benefit Grants to FQHCs to extend our mission and support key partners' pediatric -focused operations. In 2017, we revised the aim of these grants to (1) focus on mission impact concordant with their unique goals and with Lurie Children's CHNA priority areas, and (2) include more rigorous evaluation to measure impact . Lurie Children's has been designa ted by the State of Illinois as an Integrated Health Home , a new initiative that is expected to launch in January 2020 (see Activity 5.04) . The goal of this initiative is to better integrate physical and behavioral health care services and provide case management and care coordination for at -risk Medicaid enrollees. This initiative will enable Lurie Children's to expand its care coordination services to more at -risk children across the State. Leaders from Lurie Children's have been invited by the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services to serve on the planning committee for children in this program. Project ADAM is an initiative started at Children's Hospital of Wisconsin in 1999 to prevent deaths from sudden cardiac arrest t hrough advocacy, education, preparedness and collaboration . Focused prevention training and education ensures schools and communities are not only equipped, but also trained in prevention of sudden cardiac deaths. In 2019, Lurie Children's became the Illinois affiliate and hired a Project Coordinator to le ad bystander CPR trainings and provide technical assistance to local schools on the pathway to becoming Heart Safe Schools. To date, 37 trainings have been conducted with 1543 people trained, including 915 youth (12 -17 years old) . In 2018, Lurie Children's began planning and development of Lurie Children's Mobile Health Program , a mobile care clinic and health promotion program which recognizes that health is more than traditional healthcare , and that the co mmunity is foundational in these efforts to extend a community of care to kids in the community . Providing health services in community settings brings care to individuals versus putting the onus on already burdened patients and families. Integrating these services with health information, resources, and everyday tools in partnership with community -based services and neighborhood anchors like parks, libraries, and schools is what differentiates this approach. The goals of Lurie Children's Mobile Health Program include creating a patient experience closer to home, addressing gaps in healthcare access, reducing ED visits for non -urgent care, increasing health literacy and health knowledge, and connecting community residents to community resources. The pilot wi ll focus on our target communities of Belmont Cragin and Austin and will launch in fall 2019. Community Health Implementation Plan : 2018 Progress Report page 12 THE COLLABORATIVE FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH POLICY Beginning in 2017, Lurie Children's convened the following state -wide organizations as founding partners and executive council of t he Collaborative for Children' s Health Policy (www.collaborative4childrenshealth.org ): American Academy of Pediatrics Illinois Chapter Ann & Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago EverThrive Illinois Illinois Children's Healthcare Foundation The Ounce of Prevention Voices for Illinois Children The m ission of the Collaborative for Children 's Health Policy is to transform child and adolescent health and wellbeing in Illinois by partnering to advance policies and investments that will achieve health equity for youth, families and communities. The Collaborative is focused on removing the barriers that prevent sustaining progress and attention on critical child healt h policies in Illinois, including changing administrations, budget challenges and the lack of vote or voice by children. Jill Fraggos of Lurie Children's serves as Executive Director of the Collaborative. In 2017- 2018, the Collaborative hired a program coordinator to staff the organization and established policy aims to address difficulties children have accessing the services they need because of income inequity, insurance -related barriers, inadequate communication, wait lists, or lack of access to and availability of appropriate primary care. The Collaborative's policy priorities include: Increasing access to quality health services for all children Improving access to child mental health services Addressing key social determinants of health The Collaborative for Children's Health Policy is staffing a bipartisan , bicameral group of Illinois legislators from the House and Senate co-chaired by Rep. Tom Demmer, Rep. Camille Lilly , Sen. Julie Morrison, and Sen. Chuck Weaver . The Illinois Legislative C hildren' s Health Caucus will review early childhood development; physical, social and emotional health and well- being of Illinois children and adolescents; and evidence -based policies and programs to achieve health equity for children, families and communities throughout the state. In February 2018, the Children's Health Caucus held its kick -off in Springfield, Illinois. To date, 20 members of the I llinois General Assembly have agreed to join the Children's Health Caucus. The membership is bipartisan, bicameral and representative of diverse groups of constituents throughout I llinois . The Children's Health Caucus has convened three meeting s focused on access to specialty care for children on Medicaid and building mental health services in Illinois schools . Community Health Implementation Plan : 2018 Progress Report page 13 VOICES OF CHILD HEALTH IN CHICAGO To further enhance Lurie Children's understanding of the needs of children and families in Chicago and our ability to meet those needs, the Smith Child Health Research, Outreach and Advocacy Center developed the Voices of Child Health in Chicago ( luriechildrens.org/en/voices ), a new program led by Matthew Davis , MD, MAPP and focused on surveying Chicagoans to better understand the issues th at impact child health in Chicago . Through this endeavor , Lurie Children's will obtain data on children's health across the metropolitan area with an emphasis on measuring health needs and public attitudes regarding a wide range of health and health care t opics, including the priority areas in Lurie Children's CHNA . By asking Chicagoans directly about child health, we gain important perspectives and insights that sometimes can be overlooked in health research and policies. We are committed to bringing our research findings to the public to help foster an open dialogue about child health. By polling the public for its perspectives, we make sure that community views are part of our city's co nversation about child health. Lurie Children's has partnered with the Bureau of Maternal, Infant, Child, and Adolescent Health and the Bureau of Epidemiology at the Chicago Department of Public Health to develop and field the Healthy Chicago Survey Junior (HCS -Jr). HCS -Jr is a set of c hild health -focused modules that were added to the annual Healthy Chicago Survey (HCS), beginning in December 2017. As a population -representative, city -wide phone -based survey originally launched in 2014, HCS is designed to characterize the health of Chic agoans, including health concerns for each community and the social and environmental factors that impact h ealth. The version with HCS -Jr wa s fielded through June 2018 and collected data about adults' perspectives about child health specifically. Voices of Child Health in Chicago has released six reports to date based on these data: Adults Across the City Identify the Top 10 Health Problems for Youth in Chicago Chicago Parents' Behaviors and Beliefs about their Children's Flu Vaccinations Chicago Parents Id entify the Top 10 Social Issues Affecting Youth in the City Parental Paid Leave and Youth Health in Chicago Parent Concerns about Bullying and Cyberbullying Challenges to Healthy Eating for Kids HCS- Jr was fielded for a second year and data collection concluded on May 31, 2019.

Explore possibility of expanding this service to other ambulatory c are settings Currently, the Emergency Department (ED) has a staff of seven Nurse Practitioners that provide care to victims of sexual assault . Of those APRNs, six are nationally certified SANE -P (Pediatric) by the International Association of Forensic Nurses and two additionally carry the SANE -A (Adult/Adolescent) certification . Annually, these APRNs complete ~225 assessments at Lurie Children's. In addition, the ED APRN team provide s continuing education to physicians, advanced practice providers, and nurs es both internally and externally . This team has two partnership ED sites that emp loy Lurie Children's providers with eight Nurse Practitioners at those sites who have completed the SANE training and care for these victims at Central DuPage Hospital and No rthwest Community Hospital. The volumes at these outreach sites are lower, approximately 30 annually, but having the SANE education has allowed for these victims to be cared for in their community. Lurie Children's developed the Pediatric Area -wide Sexual Assault Treatment Plan model and is on the statewide Sexual Assault Taskforce to provide implementation guidance for the Sexual Assault Su rvivors Emergency Treatment Act (SASETA) signed into law in 2018 .

In 201 6-2018, CCR worked with over 30 organizations and schools on trauma-informed practices, including training over 1,800 youth -serving staff and providing implementation support and technical assistance . Curriculum included CBITS, Bounce Back, and SPARCS (in the CPS Option Schools) and the pilot of STRONG for refugee and immigrant youth. CCR is piloting a new training approach to increase reach and optimize implementation support, including developing tools for early childhood and expanding partnerships to Girls Scouts and Golden Apple. 6.03 Address the mental health needs of marginalized (undocumented, immigrant, refugee, LGBTQ and youth of color) y outh and families Provide training and services for mental health and non-mental health professionals to better support youth and families and connect to additional services as needed (ICTC Refugee & Immigrant Committee, Chicago is With You - Mental Health Task Force, Chicago Public Schools, The Kennedy Forum). In 2017, CCR implemented the \"You Are Not Alone\" initiative to broaden the number of mental health providers who are trained to work with marginalized youth and equip non-mental health professionals with evidence -based, trauma- informed resources. CCR built partnerships with Refugee One/Northeastern IL Univers ity and the Center for Latino Mental Health at The Chicago School of Professional Psychology . CCR conducted 30 trainings, reaching over 1,200 individuals in 2016- 2018 and h osted a Chicago Community Trust \" On- CHNA Implementation Plan: 2018 Progr ess Report page 29 Lurie Children's activities addressing mental health: The-Table \" discussion with refugee/ immigrant h igh school students at Sullivan High School in May 2017. CCR is leading a pilot of Supporting Transition Resilience in Newcomer Groups (STRONG) intervention, an evidence - informed, school- based intervention for newcomer youth (~ages 5 -18) experiencing psych ological distress, to enhance the capacity of school mental health professionals to support the mental health needs of newcomer elementary and secondary students experiencing psychological distress . CCR is leads Professional Learning Collaboratives that include a newly added race and equity component to address disparities, implicit bias, and cultural humility. 6.04 Reduce stigma of mental illness Partnering with Mikva Challenge to support efforts to increase youth voice on mental health and reduce stigm a (Chicago Public Schools) In December 2016, CCR partnered with Kennedy Forum Illinois , Chicago Community Trust, and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to host 175 high school students from CPS, Mikva Challenge, Lyons Township and North Shore M ental Health Ameri ca Group to participate in Kennedy Forum Annual Event focused on stigma reduction. CCR hosted an \"On The Table \" discussion in May 2019 with youth from various organizations focused on developing youth empowerment and leadership, including Mikva Challenge , and traveled to the state capital with Mikva Challenge for the proclamation of a Trauma- Informed Awareness Day to raise awareness and reduce stigma. CCR is also leading efforts to train youth and build capacity around a Mental Health Ambassadors program, which will culminate in a Youth Voice Summit in late 2019. 6.05 Provide input into CMS Waiver regarding mental health services As the state of Illinois goes through the 1115 waiver application process, provide feedback to state agencies to help model pr ograms that are evidence based and maximize outcomes for children and youth Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services is in negotiations with CMS regarding implementation. CMS approved the ILDHFS 1115 waiver in May 2018. There were 10 pilots identified as part of the approval. Lurie Children's did not apply for any of the proposed pilots but continues to support efforts to expand Medicaid -billable services to support youth and in Healthy Chicago Hospital Collaborativ e's mental health - related efforts Continue to serve on Healthy Chicago Hospital Collaborative's mental health sub -committee and participate in activities as necessary CCR serves as active member of the Chicago Trauma Informed Hospital Collaborative and the Chicago Dept. of Public Heath Trauma- Informed City Advisory Committee . CHNA Implementation Plan: 2018 Progr ess Report page 30 Lurie Children's activities addressing mental health: 6.07 Juvenile Justice Collaborative Under SCY's leadership, convene youth service providers and government stakeholders in Cook County to develop a care coordination model for justice- involved youth, thus minimizing their further involvement in the justice system and reducing racial disparities In 2017, the Juvenile Justice Collaborative implemented a demonstrat ion project. To date, the JJC has conducted 267 intakes and connected 213 youth to services. Of those, 144 youth succ essfully completed the program . In the JJC's pilot year, no youth connected to services was re-arrested during their participation in the p rogram. Further, JJC youth have a lower recidivism rate than overall diverted youth: 18% of youth who completed the JJC were re-referred to court within one year, compared to 32% of all diverted youth in Chicago. The Child and Adolescent Needs and Strengths (CANS) assessment was conducted before and after JJC participation. Needs decreased from an average of 3 needs/ youth at intake to 1 need at discharge, while strengths increased from 4 to 5. SCY continues to implement this project, now in its third year o f service provisio n. (See activity 8.02). 6.08 Primary care provider training Train primary care providers to increase knowledge base and comfort at treating patients with behavioral and mental health diagnoses To address the underlying need of mental hea lth services in primary care settings, Lurie Children's aims to build capacity of primary care physicians to provide these services through a Mood, Anxiety, ADHD Collaborative Care (MAACC) Program (see 6.09). To date, 66 community -based pediatricians acros s 16 practices are completing education and participating in monthly phone conferences about mental health assessment, medication management, and treatment monitoring. Of our current participating practices, 49 have directly consulted or referred patients to the MAACC program. This has resulted in 18 0 patients referred to the MAACC program with 110 patients seen for a MAACC evaluation. Additionally, CCR trained approximately 30 providers at Pediatric Pearls Spring 2017 session. POTENTIAL ACTIVITIES DESCRIP TION 2016- 2018 PROGRESS 6.09 Implementation of a high - volume behavioral health clinic at Lurie Children's Upon receipt of funding, create and begin providing services in a high- volume clinic setting based on an evidence -informed model Received 3 -year $1. 2 million anonymous donation to implement the TARGET program (i.e. high -volume behavioral health clinic ) and the MAACC Program to increase community -based pediatrician's capacity to provide mental health care to their patients (see 6.08). TARGET clinicians and staff have contacted 450 families to offer TARGET groups and 70 families have been enrolled. TARGET has contributed to reduced wait times for outpatient services in the Department of Psychiatry (the waiting list is reduced by more than 40% relative to before the Anonymous funding was procured). Preliminary group outcomes are promising. Fifty (50) % of patients who have completed TARGET groups thus far have been determined to need no further psychotherapy following 12 weeks of TARGET group.

Collaborate with gun violence prevention and justice reform partners around \"Building a Safe Chicago \u2014Calling for a Comprehensive Plan\" and in the Chicago Gun Violence Research Collaborative SCY actively advocates on gun violence prevention policy with the SCY Executive Director providing testimony at several General Assembly committee hearings. SCY collaborated with the Illinois Gun Violence Prevention Coalition on the Combating Illegal Gun Trafficking Act (SB 337), which passed both houses of the General Assembly in 2018 and was signed into law by Governor Pritzker in January 2019. Lurie Children's SCY is leading t he public health component of Building a Safe Chicago, a multi -sector coalition of juvenile justice and gun violence prevention advocates which released a recommendation report focused on five priorities : 1) put public health first; 2) reduce illegal handgun availability; 3) tailor punishment to the crime; 4) ensure police effectiveness, and 5) invest to achieve equity. SCY was instrumental in developing the public health -related language for the SAFE Act, a bill proposed by the coalition in 2018 and reintroduced in 2019; key concepts of the SAFE Act were incorporated as the \"Restore, Reinvest, Renew (R3) Program\" in the adult -use cannabis bi ll passed in 2019. (Note that Lurie Children's opposed the adult -use cannabis bill, HB1438.) 8.02 Juvenile Justice Collaborative Under SCY's leadership, convene youth service providers and government stakeholders in Cook County to develop a care coordinat ion model for justice -involved youth, thus minimizing their further involvement in the justice system and reducing racial disparities. In 2017, the Juvenile Justice Collaborative implemented a demonstration project. To date, the JJC has conducted 267 intakes and connected 213 youth to services. Of those, 144 youth succ essfully completed the program . In the JJC's pilot year, no youth connected to services was re - arrested during their participation in the program. Further, JJC youth have a lower recidivism rate than overall diverted youth: 18% of youth who completed the JJC were re -referred to court within one year, compared to 32% of all diverted youth in Chicago. The Child and Adolesc ent Needs and Strengths (CANS ) assessme nt was conducted before and after JJC participation. N eeds decreased from an average of 3 needs per youth at intake to 1 need at discharge, while strengths increased from 4 to 5. SCY continues to implement this projec t, now in its third year of service provision. (See activity 6.07) 8.03 Violence Data Landscape SCY convenes a collaborative of community and youth violence prevention programs, researchers, and advocates to identify strategies to increase use and SCY convened a successful 6 -month planning project funded by the Joyce Foundation and is positioned for continuing efforts once additional funding is secured.
