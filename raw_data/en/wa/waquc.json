Care Health Plan ID Card, and Medi -Cal BIC card with you. Never let anyone else use your ID cards or BIC card. Kaiser Permanente provides services to members through Kaiser Permanente network providers . They work together to provide you with quality care. When you choose Kaiser Permanente, you are choosing to get your care through our medical care program. To find where Kaiser Permanente network providers are located, visit our website at kp.org/faci lities. New members must choose a primary care provider (\" PCP\") who is in the Kaiser Permanente network and in the L.A. Care Health Plan S ervice Area. You must choose a PCP within 30 days from the time you are assigned to Kaiser Permanente. If you do not choose a PCP, we will choose one for you. You may choose the same PCP or different PCPs for all family members assigned to Kaiser Permanente. If you have a doctor you want to keep, or you want to find a new PCP, you can look in the Provider Directory. It has a list of all PCPs in the Kaiser Permanente network.

Initial health assessment (IHA) Kaiser Permanente recommends t hat, as a new member, you see your new PCP in the next 90 days for an initial health assessment (IHA). The purpose of the IHA is to help your PCP learn your health care history and needs. Your PCP may ask you some questions about your health history or may ask you to complete a questionnaire. Your PCP will also tell you about health education counseling and classes that may help you. When you call to schedule your IHA, tell the person who answers the phone that you are a member of Kaiser Permanente. Give your Kaiser Permanente medical record number. Take your BIC card and your Kaiser Permanente ID card to your appointment. It is a good idea to take a list of your medications and questions with you to your visit. Be ready to talk with your PCP about your health care needs and concerns. Be sure to call your PCP's office if you are going to be late or cannot go to your appointment. Routine care Routine care is regular health care. It includes preventive care, also called wellness or well care. It helps you stay healthy and helps keep you from getting sick. Preventive care includes regular checkups, health education, and counseling. In addition to preventive care, routine care also includes care when you are sick. Kaiser Permanente covers routine care from your PCP.

For urgent care, call your PCP. If you cannot reach your PCP, call 1 -833-KP4CARE (1 - 833-574-2273) (TTY 711) and talk to a licensed health care professional (24 hours a day, 7 days a week). If you need urgent care out of the area, go to the nearest urgent care facility. You do not need pre- approval (prior authorization). If you are traveling outside the United States and need urgent care, Medi -Cal will not pay for your care. If your care is a mental health urgent care concern, contact the county Mental Health Plans toll -free telephone number that is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

You or the hospital to which you were admitted should call Kaiser Permanente within 24 hours after you get emergency care. If you need emergency transportation, call 911.

Get emergency care only for an emergency, not for routine care or a minor illness like a cold or sore throat. If it is an emergency, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room.

The main laws that apply to this Member Handbook are state and federal laws about the Medi -Cal program. Other federal and state laws may apply too. Notice about Medi -Cal as a payer of last resort Sometimes someone else has to pay first for the services Kaiser Permanente provides you.

The California Department of Health Care Services has the right and responsibility to collect for covered Medi -Cal services for which Medi -Cal is not the first payer. The Medi -Cal program complies with state and federal laws and regulations relating to the legal liabil ity of third parties for health care services to beneficiaries.

Care Health Plan telling you that we did not change our decision, or you never received a letter telling you of our decision and it has been past 30 days, you can: Ask for a State Hearing from the Department of Social Services ( DSS), and a judge will review your case Ask for an Independent Medical Review (IMR) from DMHC and an outside reviewer who is not part of L.A. Care Health Plan or Kaiser Permanente will review your case You will not have to pay for a State Hearing or an IMR. You can ask for both a State Hearing and an IMR at the same time. You can also ask for one before the other to see if it will resolve your problem first. If you ask for an IMR first, but do not agree with the decision, you can still ask for a State Hearing later. But if you ask for a State Hearing first, and the hearing has already happened, you cannot ask for an IMR. In this case, the State Hearing has the final say. The sections below will provide you with more information on how to ask for a State Hearing or an IMR. Independent Medical Reviews (\"IMR\") An IMR is when an outside reviewer who is not related to the health plan reviews your case. If you want an IMR, you must first f ile an appeal with Kaiser Permanente or L.A. Care . If you do not hear from us within 30 calendar days, or if you are unhappy with our decision, then you may then request an IMR. You must ask for an IMR within 6 months from the date on the notice telling you of the appeal decision. You may be able to get an IMR right away without filing an appeal first. This is in cases where your health is in immediate danger or the request was denied because treatment was considered experimental or investigational. 6 | Reporting and solving problems Call member services at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711).

Visit online at kp.org page 76 The pa ragraph below will provide you with information on how to request an IMR. Note that the term \"grievance\" is talking about both \"complaints\" and \"appeals.\" The California Department of Managed Health Care is responsible for regulating health care service pl ans. If you have a grievance against your health plan, you should first telephone your health plan at 1-800-464-4000 (TTY 711) and use your health plan's grievance process before contacting the department. Utilizing this grievance procedure does not prohibit any potential legal rights or remedies that may be available to you. If you need help with a grievance involving an emergency, a grievance that has not been satisfactorily resolved by your health plan, or a grievance that has remained unresolved for more than 30 days, you may call the department for assistance. You may also be eligible for an Independent Medical Review (IMR). If you are eligible for IMR, the IMR process will provide an impartial review of medical decisions made by a health plan related t o the medical necessity of a proposed service or treatment, coverage decisions for treatments that are experimental or investigational in nature and payment disputes for emergency or urgent medical services. The department also has a toll -free telephone number (1-888-HMO -2219) and a TDD line (1 -877-688-9891) for the hearing and speech impaired. The department's Internet Web site http://www.hmohelp.ca.gov has complaint forms, IMR application forms and instructions online. State Hearings A State Hearing is a meeting with people from the Department of Social Services (DSS). A judge will help to resolve your problem. You can ask for a State Hearing only if you have already filed an appeal with either Kaiser Permanente or L.A. Care Health Plan.
