Medicine with Meaning We asked Anthroposophic physicians to share their perspectives on what makes Anthroposophic Medicine different than other approaches. Their personal stories are both powerful and inspiring. If you would like to explore this path for yourself, we warmly invite you to attend [a training week](/annual-training-week) with us. We also offer webinars, that, although they are not in person, still allow you to get a taste of the deep insights that are available and the transformations that are possible.
