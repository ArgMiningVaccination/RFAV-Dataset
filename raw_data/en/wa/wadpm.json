Salman has also become UNICEF's chosen spokesman for AIDS prevention, and he and the group have publicly advocated the cause of peace with Indi a. But a coalition of fundamentalist Islamic parties has made recent gains in Pakistani elections, and Junoon's high profile places them in conflict with the hardliners. WIDE ANGLE follows Salman as he journeys to the tolerant, ancient city of Lahore and t he fundamentalist stronghold of Peshawar to reveal the internal religious and political conflicts of the Islamic world. The mullahs want to ban the music but Junoon's fans, among them Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf, have made Salman a rock idol.

We currently produce the food in factories in Malawi, Sierra Leone, and Ghana. 10 The humble beginnings of Project Peanut Butter can be traced to the late 1990s, when St. Louis Children's Hospital pediatrician and Washington University Professor of Pediatrics, Dr. Mark Manary, traveled to Malawi and realized that the standard therapy for treating severely maln ourished kids (a milk -based formula) was ineffective. Dr. Manary set about formulating a new therapeutic food -one that didn't spoil, didn't need to be cooked, and could be used by mothers in the home setting. Together with his colleague Dr. Andr\u00e9 Briend, D r. Manary came up with the perfect blend of ingredients to treat malnourished children: a combination of peanut butter, powdered milk, vegetable oil, sugar, and vitamins and minerals. Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) was born, and recovery rates jumped from 40% to 95% in initial clinical trials in Malawi. In 2007, the World Health Organization, the United Nations, and the World Food Programme publicly endorsed Dr. Manary's RUTF and home -based therapy as the standard of care for severely malnourished chi ldren throughout the world. Today, PPB helps feed hundreds of thousands of malnourished children. We distribute the locally produced therapeutic food at our own mobile clinics, where PPB nurses assess children for malnutrition and provide qualifying childr en with life -saving food at no charge. We also sell a large amount of RUTF at the cost of manufacture to multiple governments and aid organizations around the world. Speaker: A native of St. Louis, Margaret Loehnig graduated from Nerinx Hall High School in 2008 and from Truman State University in 2012, earning a Bachelor of Science in Health Science and minors in Sociology and Biology. She spent the next year working for a nonprofit organization called AIDS Interfaith Residential Services (AIRS) in Baltimor e, Maryland, through the Lutheran Volunteer Corps. As a Residential Aide at AIRS, she cared for 10 individuals living with AIDS and other physical and mental disabilities. In August 2013, Margaret deferred her admission to nursing school when she was given the opportunity to work full -time with Project Peanut Butter. She first heard about PPB when a representative came to speak at her University, and she was inspired to get more involved in eliminating malnutrition. Margaret traveled to Malawi with PPB in S eptember 2013 and will be returning in April. *** Can We Have \"Caring Democracy?\" Monday, March 31 7:00 - 8:00 p.m. Busch Student Center 254 Sponsored By: Department of Political Science, Women's and Gender Studies Program Open class.

Global injustices continue to manifest themselves in diverse ways, often affecting the poorer people in the society, effacing the middle class and sanitizing economic systems that are not founded on the basic principles of social justice. Such global injus tices hit hard at countries emerging out of conflict and struggling to rebuild their societies. In addressing the challenges of post -conflict reconstruction, global politics tends to favour a liberal peace approach that puts emphasis on liberalization of e conomic systems, democracy, human rights advocacy and the rule of law. However, without an integrated transitional justice system that takes into account citizen participation in addressing past human rights violations and attempts towards national healing and reconciliation, post conflict reconstruction could expose weaker nations to further global injustices dictated by marketization of the African populations. *** 13 Impact on Health: Availability of Food and Food Deserts in St. Louis Tuesday, April 1 12:00 - 1:00 p.m. Learning Resources Center, Pitlyk Auditorium A Sponsored By: Global Health Learning Community In 2008 the annual medical cost of obesity was $147 billion with more than one third of the U.S. population considered obese.

In this presentation, Dr. Jeanne Rueth will ask if there was/is an alternate, more grassroots stra tegy for legal development that might have been more successful in the long run. *** Advocacy and Awareness for Humanity in the Globalized Classroom Tuesday, April 1 1:00 - 2:00 p.m. Center for Global Citizenship Seminar Room Sponsored By: English for Acad emic Purposes Human trafficking takes many forms and is sweeping the globe like a virus.

Interviewed at ceremonies, refugee camps and concerts, the musicians demonstrate mus ic's ability to raise global awareness about Mali, its culture and its challenges. The musicians also carry a local message: sing to bear witness, to forgive and to reconcile.

The Model is being implemented in Bangladesh as PEP (Poverty Eradication Program). The PSDI Model is holistic in nature, recognizing that the extreme poor face so many obstacles to their economic recovery that only a comprehensive program can offer them a per manent uplift from poverty. The Model encourages the poorest families to form partnerships, which allow them to devise creative solutions to their own social, economic and environmental problems, and then helps them to obtain the resources necessary to bri ng those plans to fruition. Each family member has a role and every program has an educational component. Their successes are measurable due to a system that uses a ground up delivery approach. Through a network of trained, field, social workers in the vil lages, partner families are visited biweekly to monitor their progress in meeting their interim goals. Most families enter the program near starvation and are able to realize their dream of financial stability and independence within ten years. To date, 94 ,000 families (470,000 people) have been partners and 87,000 children have completed PEP primary schools. Virginia Klein is a co -founder and the Executive Director of PSDI.

A nd don't forget the Junoon live concert on Friday, April 4 at 6:30 p.m. to be held in the Wool Ballrooms, Busch Student Center at Saint Louis University. Biography: Salman Ahmad, one of South Asia's most influential cultural figures, is a musician, physic ian and United Nations goodwill ambassador. With his wife, Samina, he launched an NGO called the Salman & Samina Global Wellness Initiative, focused on interfaith and cross -cultural dialogue, global health and wellness, and music education. Ahmad popular ized a blend of Western rock music and Eastern/Islamic music that has been called \"Sufi rock\" and that has been hailed as a cultural bridge within South Asia and between the East and West. Born in Lahore, Pakistan, Ahmad spent his teenage years in New Yo rk before returning to Lahore to train as a medical doctor. 31 Turning then to his true passion of music, Ahmad founded South Asia's biggest rock band, Junoon, in 1990. The band faced death threats and harassment from religious extremists and government forc es in its early years, but Junoon's sweeping melodies, bhangra rock rhythms and driving guitars led it to become known as \"the U2 of South Asia.\" Junoon has sold over 25 million albums worldwide and has shared the stage with artists such as Melissa Etheri dge, Alicia Keys, Sting, Earth Wind and Fire, and Wyclef Jean. Ahmad has recently co -written and recorded a song with academy award winning artist Melissa Etheridge called Ring the Bells. Ahmad led Junoon in a 2001 performance at the U.N. General Assembly Hall-the first such rock performance in that hall. In 2007 Junoon performed at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo. The group defied death threats from militants to perform in 2008 in the valley of Kashmir -- the first rock concert to be held in Srinag ar.

In the United States, minorities consistently attempt to have their rights recognized within the courts. One of these minorities, the LGBT community, has fought their specific type of oppression through different legal arguments - ranging from individual liberty guarantees to the condemnation of moral legislation. The variety of arguments and legal issues within LGBT cases has led to disagreements concerning the usefulness of each approach in obtaining the desired outcomes. I argue that the most successful and pragmatic route to equal rights for this community lies in the privacy arguments which have proven successful in the past. More specifically, advocacy for LGBT plaintiffs should be based in Lockean ideals concerning privacy. These ideals, properly understood, construct an umbrella under which the LGBT community may expect substantial progress in governmental recognit ion of its rights without negatively affecting their interests in equality. *** Civic Education and Women's Political Participation in Pakistan Thursday, April 3 2:15 - 3:30 p.m. Busch Student Center 253 D Sponsored By: Atlas Planning Committee, Center for Global Citizenship *** Climate Change at SLU: Food for Thought Thursday, April 3 2:15 - 3:30 p.m. Busch Student Center 253 C Sponsored By: Department of Philosophy, Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, College of Arts and Sciences, Department of Biology Catastrophic climate change is rapidly heading our way.

Beyond a gesture of compassion, however, serious questions may surround the professional ethics and actual effectiveness of this practice. Short -term medical missions is often further complicated by concerns connected with limited time commitment, inadequate resources, unfamiliar cultural context, and lack of continuity following departure. The key element in ass uring that such missions are both ethical and effective is national partnerships: cooperation with healthcare professionals, healthcare institutions and/or educational institutions in the host nation. Such partnership may involve provision of materials, in struction, and/or special services - always in collaboration with, and ideally, under the direction of national leaders. *** Film: Seeds of Hope Thursday, April 3 3:00 - 4:30 p.m. Busch Student Center 254 Sponsored By: College of Arts & Sciences, Film Stu dies Program, Africa World Documentary Film Festival, Department of English, Center for Intercultural Studies, Department of Fine and Performing Arts, and Center for International Studies In a corner of Eastern Congo one woman puts herself at risk every d ay to help thousands of Congolese rape survivors embark on a journey of healing.

A Sudanese man who was thrown into prison in Ethiopia for helping the Lost Boys and was left gasping for air through a crack under the door. A Mexican woman who t aught herself English by looking up the meaning of the profane words that were hurled at her at her first job in a meat packing plant. A Dutch boy, dressed as a cowboy, who put the flag of the Netherlands through the paper 45 shredder and declared, \"I am an A merican.\" These are some of the characters brought to life in Vang, a drama about recent immigrant farmers. The immigrant farmers in this production came from four continents, speaking over six different languages, with multiple experiences of the world. I n their own ways, they adjusted to life in America. Some of these immigrants came to the U.S. as refugees from war -torn parts of the world. Others came fleeing poverty in their homelands. Still others came with money, invited to join agri -business ventures . Many of these immigrants landed in the U.S. and took the only jobs they could find -in meatpacking plants and auto repair shops. But all of these immigrants had grown up on farms and wanted to once again assume the livelihood that they had known in the pa st, the work that had formed the foundation of their cultural roots. The public often thinks of farmers as white males of European ancestry living in isolated rural areas. And the public often thinks of immigrants as those who have slipped into the United States to take advantage of assistance programs. Vang blows both of those stereotypes and opens discussion about how farming is done in the United States and how immigrants have become part of the larger agricultural picture. *** ISA Spring Show Saturday, April 5 7:00 - 10:00 p.m. Harris Stowe University Auditorium Sponsored By: Indian Student Association Spring Show is a showcase of Indian culture through the medium of dance, music and acting.

The band faced death threats a nd harassment from religious extremists and government forces in its early years, but Junoon's sweeping melodies, bhangra rock rhythms, and driving guitars led it to become known as \"the U2 of South Asia.\" Junoon has sold over 25 million albums worldwide a nd has shared the stage with artists such as Melissa Etheridge, Alicia Keys, Sting, Earth Wind and Fire, and Wyclef Jean.
