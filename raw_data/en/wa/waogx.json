FOREWORD The International Conference on Primary Health Care, held in 1978 in Alma-Ata in the former Soviet Union, launched \"Health for All\", a global movement that has shaped the dynamics of public health ever since. Yet, despite indisputable advances made, the situation remains as \"health for some\". Issues such as disparity in health-care coverage; lack of equitable, accessible and afford\u00ad able health care for all; and problems with availability of realistic financial resources for health serv\u00ad ices and medicines are daily realities for the indigent, the marginalized and the underprivileged. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that one-third of the world's population has no regular access to essential modern medicines; in some parts of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, as much as half of the population faces these persistent shortages. However, in these same situations, the rich resources of traditional remedies and practitioners are available and accessible. Traditional medicines play a primary role in people's health, as they have for thousands of years. The range of therapies and practices is wide, varying greatly from country to country and from region to region. The most well-known are the Ayurveda of India and traditional Chinese medicine and these systems of medicine have now spread co other countries. The use of herbal medicines, and complementary and alternative medicine, is increasing in indus\u00ad trialized countries, in connection with disease prevention and the maintenance of health. There is an emphasis on self-empowerment and a more holistic approach, in which life is understood as being a union of body, senses, mind and soul; and health as being the combination of physi\u00ad cal, mental, social and spiritual well-being. This approach is consistent with WHO's definition of health. The practices of traditional, complementary and alternative medicine focus on the holistic approach and include medicinal planes. Herbal medicines are perceived as \"safe\", although in reality there are potential risks, such as side-effects, in the use of all medicines. The relatively low cost of traditional remedies and their greater accessibility contrasts with the rising cost and limited avail\u00ad ability of a number of even the most essential modern medicines. The WHO Global Atlas of Traditional, Complementary and Alternative Medicine relates well to one ofWHO's overall strategic directions in traditional medicine for 2002-2005; chat of cackling excess mortality and morbidity especially among poor and marginalized populations. Traditional medicine's accessibility and affordability are key values for populations struggling against commu\u00ad nicable and noncommunicable diseases, especially in their chronic forms. We have seen a global resurgence of interest in the use of traditional, complementary and alterna\u00ad tive medicine over the last decade. The Fifty-sixth World Health Assembly formally acknowledged this in May 2003; Member States discussed the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2002-2005 and adopted resolution WHA56.31. These documents set out squarely the major challenges: the lack of organized networks of traditional practitioners; the lack of sound evidence of the safety, ef\u00ad ficacy and quality of traditional medicines; the need for measures to ensure proper use of traditional medicines and to protect and preserve traditional and natural resources necessary for their sustain\u00ad able application; and measures for training and licensing of traditional practitioners. The Traditional Medicine Strategy reflects both the value placed on traditional medicine as a re\u00ad source, and the challenges ahead. le details four directions for our work with countries in this field: in the areas of policy (where we aim to broaden recognition of traditional medicine, supporting its integration into national health systems as appropriate, and protecting indigenous knowledge); safety, efficacy and quality (where our work is co expand the knowledge base on traditional medi\u00ad cine and raise its credibility); access (where we must work co increase availability and affordability, especially for poor populations); and rational use (where the task is to ensure appropriate and sus\u00ad tainable use of these medicines by consumers and providers, preserving and protecting medicinal plane resources and knowledge of traditional medicine). Mapping the issues through this Atlas gives chem fresh impact, illustrating graphically the \"gaps\", and therefore the needs. In this way it directly supports the implementation of WHO's strategic plans. For example, a map chat shows only 25 countries as having a national policy for traditional medicine should stimulate enquiry and remedial action on regulation. ix x FOREWORD The Atlas is an advocacy tool co show the global community where our efforts are most required and to stimulate joint responsibility for solving the problems. It is also part of the solution. The actual process of its compilation has, in itself, been a useful means of raising the profile of tradi\u00ad tional medicine globally. In asking the questions and articulating the issues, constructive progress has already been made in underlining the importance of traditional medicine in the field of public health and highlighting to all Member States where work still needs co be done. The Atlas provides reliable, evidence-based information on the use and practice of traditional medi\u00ad cine in the world today, to stimulate decision-making in health sector development and reform. It provides a reference and research cool for all those who are working to increase availability and accessibility to cost-effective remedies and methods of treatment; and to promote proper use and to improve training and education of providers of traditional medicines, and complementary and alternative therapies. I believe that the success of these efforts will eventually lead to a more com\u00ad prehensive health-care delivery which will, in turn, bring us closer co realizing \"Health for All\" in the 21 st century. July 2004 Dr Wilfried Kreisel Director WHO Centre for Health Development Kobe,Japan PREFACE Traditional medicine (TM) has always maintained its popularity worldwide. In addition, for more than a decade, there has been an increasing use of complementary and alternative medi\u00ad cine (CAM) in many developed and developing countries. In line with increased international de\u00ad mand, the safety, efficacy and quality of the products and practices used in TM/CAM have become important concerns for both health authorities and the public. Therefore, WHO Member States are seeking to establish policy frameworks and deciding in what ways these products and practices should be regulated to ensure their safety, efficacy and quality. In this context, it would be beneficial for Member States to share experiences in order to assist each other as they begin to develop their own policies and regulations. The compilation of the WHO Global Adas of Traditional, Comple\u00ad mentary and Alternative Medicine has provided a mechanism for sharing evidence-based informa\u00ad tion on the current state of TM/CAM. BACKGROUND TO THE DATA COLLECTION AND WORKING PROCESS The Global Adas was designed to record and map the current status of TM/CAM around the world, in terms of policy, regulation, education, research, practices and use. To this end WHO through its Centre for Health Development (WHO Kobe Centre) organized cwo meetings, in Sep\u00ad tember 2001 and in June 2003. All together, 73 participants, including national health authorities, experts, and representatives of NGOs, from 45 countries in the six WHO regions, engaged in an international collaborative effort to prepare the Global Adas. The meeting in 2001 reviewed and discussed the primary data available on the prevalence and utilization ofTM/CAM, as well as the development of a working procedure to compile national in\u00ad formation and data for the Adas. Since TM/CAM is not been legally recognized in many countries and there is a lack of data for most countries, the participants decided that the Global Adas would be based on data from secondary sources. Due to the lack of an effective and generally-accepted tool for the purposes of secondary data collection, three types of indicator were proposed; background, structural (including a survey quality assessment indicator), and process indicators (see Annexes). These indicators were employed to gather the demographic information, infrastructural develop\u00ad ment of TM/CAM at the national level, and its utilization and popularity. Before launching the global data collection of information, the feasibility of using the indicators was field-tested in Indonesia, Panama, Thailand, and Viet Nam in cooperation with national authorities relating to TM. In order to gather these data, the WHO Kobe Centre together with the Traditional Medicine Team at WHO Headquarters and the six WHO regional offices set up a working group in each region. The WHO European Region coordinators working at Global Initiative for Traditional Systems (GIFTS) of Health at Oxford University, United Kingdom, were commissioned by the WHO Kobe Centre to collate the information received from the six regional working groups. Each working group contacted national focal points and/or working partners in the countries of their respective region to collect information and data. After global data collection, analysis and colla\u00ad tion by the regional working groups had been completed, a meeting was convened in June 2003, at which it was agreed that the Global Adas would consist of a map volume and a text volume. After the meeting, the WHO Kobe Centre sent the final draft of each country chapter to the respective national health authorities for their review and comments. UTILIZATION OF THE GLOBAL ATLAS The Global Adas facilitates an easy review of many aspects of the situation regarding the use ofTM/ CAM in different countries, which therapies are most popular worldwide, how many countries have already established policy and regulation of TM/CAM, etc. It provides a rich source of infor\u00ad mation to assist Member States seeking to develop their national policies on TM/CAM. However, it should be noted that the Global Adas was prepared on the basis of information and data from secondary sources and references are included at the appropriate points. One of the four objectives of the WHO Traditional Medicines Strategy 2002-2005 is to assist Member States to integrate TM/CAM with national health-care systems, as appropriate, by de-xi xii PREFACE veloping and implementing national TM/CAM policies and programmes. From the information gathered in an ongoing WHO global survey of national policy and regulation of TM/CAM and herbal medicines, it is clear that the situation is evolving rapidly and that many countries are cur\u00ad rently engaged in establishing national policies and regulations. Thus, in order to capture this changing scenario, the Global Atlas will need to be updated regularly. Meanwhile, it provides an excellent overview of the situation of TM/CAM in the world today. July 2004 Dr Xiaorui Zhang Coordinator, Traditional Medicine Department of Essential Drugs and Medicines Policy World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland INTRODUCTION Gerard Bodeker1, Chi-Keong Ong2 and Gemma Burford3 1 Chair, Global Initiative For Traditional Systems (GIFTS) of Health, and Senior Clinical Lecturer in Public Health, University of Oxford, Green College, 43 Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6HG, United Kingdom.

E-mail: gemmaburford@yahoo.co.uk. It is now well established that interest in traditional, complementary and alternative medicine (TCAM) is rising rapidly throughout the world. Policy-makers, consumers and professional or\u00ad ganizations h~ve been calling for greater evidence of efficacy and safety, integration of TCAM and modern (allopathic) medical services, public sector support for TCAM services and comprehensive national policies for what has been, until recently, a consumer-led interest in most countries. Some countries, notably China, India and a number of others in Asia have been working actively to build the TCAM sector for the combined reasons of tradition and cost-effectiveness. In addition, aware\u00ad ness of the significant export potential of herbal medicines in a burgeoning global marketplace has accelerated the drive for increased levels of production and quality control. In the context of this changing health-care environment it became apparent that there is the need for a comprehensive policy overview of TCAM and for countries to share information about their experiences with policy, legislation, regulation, research development, financing, training and pro\u00ad fessional development, quality control and safety regulation. In response to this need and international momentum, the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2002-2005 (I) was formulated. Ic identifies four broad areas for action if che potential ofTCAM co play a role in public health is to be maximized. These areas are: policy; safety, efficacy and quality; access; and rational use. While consumer demand is rising and policy-makers are beginning to respond with moves to for\u00ad malize TCAM within national policy, it is widely recognized that the indigenous sources of medical knowledge, handed down from generation co generation, are disappearing, especially within the oral traditions of the world. In these traditions, health knowledge extends co an appreciation of both the material and non-material properties of planes, animals and minerals. Their classifica\u00ad tory systems range in scope from the cosmological to the particular in addressing the physiological make-up of the individual and the specific categories of materia medica needed to enhance health and well-being. Mental, social, emotional, spiritual, physical and ecological factors are all taken into account. In establishing policy, it is important that these fundamental theoretical underpinnings of traditional health systems are respected and perpetuated in order to ensure their continuity and benefit in an intact form. The WHO Centre for Health Development (WHO Kobe Centre; WKC), Kobe, Japan, has been addressing the issues associated with traditional medicine since 1999 and has, in a series of inter\u00ad national meetings and publications, promoted the generation of information concerning priority research areas and development of the sector (2, 3). One of these meetings (3) resulted in the gen\u00ad eration of a standardized sec of indicators (Annex 1) which were identified as central to the develop\u00ad ment of a global overview that could be presented as an atlas of TCAM. In 2000, WKC and the Global Initiative for Traditional Systems (GIFTS) of Health at Oxford University, United Kingdom, participated in the WHO International Symposium (4) which led to the collection of information for the Global Atlas. In partnership with working groups set up by the WKC and the WHO regional offices, GIFTS of Health worked with the Geographical Information Systems Unit of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom, in the mapping process. ... XIII xiv INTRODUCTION Maps are essentially the produce of aggregating large amounts of quite detailed information, but it was also recognized chat a level of detail should be preserved in developing this Global Adas. Thus two volumes have been produced. The text volume includes six regional overviews and national reports from three or four countries in each WHO region. The map volume provides a visual rep\u00ad resentation of the distribution of policy developments in a range of areas globally, across regions and within countries. Predictably, the maps reflect the level of detail of the information chat was available for their construction. During the data collection exercise it became apparent chat there are fewer data available on TCAM than desired, thus making che mapping more approximate than would be ideal. The exercise also highlighted che need for regular national, regional and international surveys ofTCAM utilization trends, safety reporting, economic studies of TCAM, and policy analyses of different regulatory strategies and their impact on service delivery and consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, the devel\u00ad opment of the Global Adas has underscored che need for clinical and experimental research, large\u00ad scale policy-related research, utilization studies and public health outcomes research in relation co TCAM. As a result of the compilation of data in che Global Adas ic is clear chat there is a wide spectrum of policy development across WHO regions and among countries within regions. Interestingly, there is a global trend away from the sector being led by consumers and advocacy groups of prac\u00ad titioners and cowards a situation where governments in most countries are working co establish a full regulatory context for che practice and use ofTCAM. Ac one end of the spectrum, there are countries which formally promote and finance TCAM development while, at the other end, there are countries where this has not yet begun. In between, there is a large volume of emerging policy and investment, with varying degrees of autonomy ofTCAM professions. However, licde is known, other than in a very few industrialized countries, of the full extent ofTCAM use by the public, par\u00ad ticularly the differing patterns of use according to disease, income, gender, geography and culture. Significant national and international investment into this type of research and in health-systems research will be needed co ensure chat subsequent editions of the Global Atlas are able to provide greater levels of detail for mapping trends, identifying che outcomes of various policy models, and providing a detailed framework co assist countries with che further development of their TCAM sector. However, che process has begun and there is now a global bird's eye view of the scams of TCAM. It is hoped chat che two volumes of the Global Adas will contribute to the evolution of the sector and its response co the global demand for pluralism in health care. References 1.

E-mail: gemmaburford@yahoo.co.uk INTRODUCTION The standardized core indicators selected during the International Consultative Meeting, \"Global Information on Traditional Medicine/Complementary and Alternative Medicine\" (J) provided the basic framework for the atlas data collection exercise. Three groups of indicators were established for background, structural and process variables for all countries and regions. The background indi\u00ad cators cover aspects of the basic demography of a nation or region. The structural indicators exam\u00ad ine the legislative, policy, regulatory, financing and research infrastructure of a nation or region. The process indicators aim to elucidate the trends and patterns of use of traditional, complementary and alternative medicine (TCAM) in each country and region. The process indicators also examine health economics, sociodemographic factors and rationale for choice with respect co TCAM. TESTING AND DEPLOYMENT OF THE DATA COLLECTION INSTRUMENT A questionnaire (Annex 1) was developed based on the indicators established (J), field tested in four countries (Indonesia, Panama, Thailand, and Viet Nam) and then deployed to collect infor\u00ad mation from the Member States in the six WHO regions. Regional coordinators were responsible for collaring the completed questionnaires and producing an interim report for their region. Based on the results of this exercise and the outcome of a review meeting in June 2003, a short form was developed (Annex 3) and regional coordinators were asked to use this to submit final datasets for the purposes of mapping. The WHO European Region coordinators at the GIFTS for Health at the University of Oxford were appointed as global coordinators for this project. SEARCH STRATEGY To amplify data for some regions (African, Eastern Mediterranean and European Regions), a systemat\u00ad ic bibliographic search and Internet search strategy was used. The Internet was used to search for con\u00ad tacts, organizations and education centres involved with TCAM. Keywords such as 'complementary therapies, complementary medicine, alternative therapies, alternative medicine, traditional medicine', and the names of individual therapies, were submitted to a number of broad-based search engines which included www.google.com, www.alltheweb.com, and www.metacrawler.com. In the Internet search using www.google.com, all official health websites relating to a WHO region (e.g. Ministry of Health websites) were identified and scanned for information on TCAM (with the aid of internal search engines in the sites where available). Similar searches were then carried out for each country, using (in turn) the names of the individual therapies as well as the search 'Unani' and 'Islamic medicine' were also used for some countries. In rhe bibliographic search, two separate search engines line (search terms 'medicine' and 'health'). Abstracts of relevant papers, and wherever possible the full articles, were obtained. Searches were carried out using the British Library's AMED database (Allied and Complementary Medicine) on the SilverPlatter server. PubMed was also searched for xv xvi MATERIALS AND METHODS relevant papers published in the conventional medical literature. 'Grey' or unpublished literature was also sought. The grey literature databases SIGLE (System for Information on Grey Litera\u00ad ture in Europe, available from SilverPlatter) and CISCOM (maintained by the Research Council for Complementary Medicine; www.rccm.org.uk) were searched for dissertations, and local and regional projects/ reports. Additional contributions were also gained through personal contacts and extant collaborations in TCAM work around the world. Major TCAM organizations in the various regions, and the coun\u00ad try offices of the WHO, were also contacted and asked to provide local scientific papers, reports or journals about TCAM in their regions or countries. The Traditional Medicine Programme of WHO Kobe Centre was instrumental in connecting the various regional collaborators with the global coordinators at GIFTS of Health in Oxford thus facilitating the collection of information and materials. MAPPING PREPARATION AND SCORING The revised indicator form (Annex 3) was used for scoring and categorization of the various back\u00ad ground, structural and process indicators. The way in which scoring was conducted for the struc\u00ad tural indicator maps in the volume is illustrated below. General Overview Maps a) Maps on Legislation and Policy The question \"Is there an official TCAM policy?\" was combined with the multi-part question \"Is there TCAM legislation?\" to provide a five-category score as follows: 0 = no data 1 = no legislation 2 = legislation pending, or in process of development 3 = legislation exists, but no known official policy 4 = official national policy exists b) Maps on Public Sector Funding for TCAM The question ''Are there any financing systems chat contribute to the provision of certain TCAM therapies in the public sector?\" was organized into a simple three-category score as follows: 0 = no data 1 = no 2 = yes c) Maps on Education and Regulation ofTCAM The question \"Is there a ministry, institution or national expert committee whose mandate includes TCAM control, education, information and/or research?\" was combined with the question \"Is there a national voluntary self-regulatory mechanism or system for TCAM?\" co provide these maps. This combination was organized into a five-category score as follows: 0 = no data 1 = no regulation or education 2 = presence of educational initiatives but no regulation 3 = presence of regulatory initiatives but no education 4 = presence of initiatives for both education and regulation Practitioner Status Maps a) Legal recognition of TCAM practitioners by therapy The question ''Are any of these TCAM providers legally recognized: 1. herbalists 11. spiritual or faith healers WHO GLOBAL ATLAS OF TRADITIONAL, COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MAP VOLUME 111. traditional birch attendants/midwives 1v. traditional bone-setters/ x1. others -please specify below?\" was utilized to score for the maps of the legal recognition ofTCAM in each country. The scoring was a simple three-category score: 0 = no data/do not know 1 = no 2 = yes b) Conventional professionally-qualified health-care practitioners who are entitled to provide TCAM Individual maps were constructed for physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, midwives and pharma\u00ad cists utilizing data from the question \"Which professionally qualified health care practitioners are entitled to provide TCAM therapies: 1. physicians with TCAM training 11. physicians without TCAM training 111. nurses with TCAM training 1v. nurses without TCAM training v. training viii. midwives without TCAM training?\" In addition, any mentions of pharmacists being qualified co provide TCAM was noted and scored to provide the maps for pharmacists. The scoring for all of these maps was a six-category score encompassing: 0 = no data 1 = no TCAM provision at all, with or without training 2 = none of the listed TCAM therapies require recognized training 3 = a few or some TCAM therapies require recognized training 4 = most TCAM therapies require recognized training 5 = providing any TCAM therapy at all requires recognized training MAPPING PROCESS DATA The paucity of useable process information meant chat, in all but a small minority of cases, maps of process data could only be produced from inferred data. A methodology was constructed to predict the popularity of individual TCAM therapies in all countries from which no suitable process infor\u00ad mation could be collected from the Ministry of Health or the regional coordinator. Rationale for the creation of an inferred database The rationale was chat any therapy for which a practitioner census had been conducted; for which there is legislation; which is publicly financed; for which professional organizations exist; for which academic research has been conducted; for which educational and training programmes exist, or for which consumer interest has been demonstrated, must be of reasonable popularity in a country. xvii ... XVIII MATERIALS AND METHODS The secondary assumption was chat popularity of any given therapy could be inferred from the number of the above indicator categories in which it is mentioned; the higher the number of men\u00ad tions, the greater the popularity. Creation of the National Popularity Measure (NPM) score for each therapy The unweighced NPM score is created by awarding 1 point to a therapy for each of the following indicators: 1. specific legislation (for practitioners or products) 11. education (within or outside conventional health-care system) 111. professional associations (with or without voluntary self-regulation status) 1v. public financing (insurance or free provision) v. there is a census of the number of practitioners vr. institutions exist for the therapy vu. the therapy is listed as popular in the process section or published literature. The maximum score, therefore, for any therapy in a given country is 7. The minimum is zero, which could denote either non-existence of the therapy, or absence of official recognition, or insuf\u00ad ficient data on utilization and on formal recognition. The scores were then used co classify therapies into levels of popularity in the following way: 0 = therapy not used, or no data 1 = low popularity, or insufficient data co draw inferences (L) 2-3 = medium popularity (M) 4-7 = high popularity (H) Attempts were made co rank therapies utilizing this simple schema. Maps were then produced us\u00ad ing these levels of popularity, therapy by therapy, for herbal/traditional medicine, Ayurveda, other Indian systems of medicine, traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, osteopathy, chiropractic, homeopachy, boneseccing, aromatherapy and reflexology and other related therapies, massage and other manual therapies. In countries for which actual process information (in the form of an L, M, H or O score) was provided directly by the respective government or the regional coordinator, this score was used for mapping, in place of inferred data. Creation of weighted scores for each therapy Analyses were conducted co correlate the inferred popularity of the various therapies with national gross domestic product. These analyses split each region into two national groupings: chose with a gross domestic produce greater than or equal to Inc$ 15 OOO, and chose with gross domestic product less than Inc$ 15 OOO (gross domestic product statistics were obtained from www.who.int for the year 2000). Inc$ is a standardized currency chat cakes into account purchasing power parities. Three thresholds were reseed-Inc$ 10 OOO, Inc$ 15 OOO, and Inc$ 20 OOO. The Inc$ 10 OOO threshold was rejected because several industrialized nations had poverty lines above this value. The Inc$ 20 OOO threshold was also rejected because it resulted in over-representation of countries in the low-income group, rendering all statistical comparisons meaningless because of the very small sample sizes in the high income group. For these analyses, because comparisons were made between groups of countries, NPM scores were weighted to correct for countries with insufficient or no data. Student's t-cesc was then used co com\u00ad pare the weighted NPM scores (WNPM) for each therapy between countries with gross domestic product < Inc$ 15 OOO and.::: Inc$ 15 OOO. The following formula was used co calculate the WNPM for each therapy within a country: WNPM = NPM x Q (1.1) Where Q = the proportion of countries within the income band for which data are available. WHO GLOBAL ATLAS OF TRADITIONAL, COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MAP VOLUME Tables and figures showing the relative popularity of each therapy in lower and higher income countries are reported in Section E. l of this volume, together with the P values for the complete ta\u00ad ble of c-tests. A further set of figures showing the popularity of different therapies by WHO region (ranked by regional WNPM, or rWNPM) is presented in Section E.2. For the regional compari\u00ad sons, rWNPM scores were calculated as follows: rWNPM = NPM x R (1.2) Where R = the proportion of countries within the region for which data are available. MAPPING These weighted scores were entered into Microsoft Excel XP and standardized spreadsheets were produced and transmitted co the mapping group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The scores were transferred co the geographical information system (GIS) ArcGIS 8.3 co produce the maps. The first draft sec of maps was used alongside the tables for expert review and adjustment where necessary. le is important co note with regard to the maps, the designations employed and the presentation of material on the maps used in this Global Atlas do not imply the expression of any opinion whatso\u00ad ever on the part of the World Health Organization concerning the legal status of any country, ter\u00ad ritory, city or area or of its authorities, or concerning the delimitation of its frontiers or boundaries. Coloured docs have been used on some maps to represent the smaller \"island\" countries which are too small co show up clearly. These have only been used where there are data for the country. CONCLUSION The maps in this Global Atlas reflect che level of detail available in the data which was used for their construction and reinforce the need for standardization of future data collection initiatives. Overall, the results highlight the need for regular national, regional and international surveys on TCAM utilization trends, safety reporting, economic studies and policy analyses of different regulatory strategies and their impact on service delivery and consumer satisfaction.

Assoc1ATIONS BETWEEN H1GH AND Low GRoss DOMESTIC PRODUCT AND SELECTED SPECIFIC THERAPIES BY POPULARITY USING WEIGHTED NATIONAL POPULARITY MEASURE SCORES CAPTION These tables and charts show that a two-tier system of preference for TCAM exists globally. At the first level, certain forms ofTCAM, namely traditional/herbal medicines and traditional Indian systems of medicine, are likely to be as popular in low-income nations as they are in high-income countries (defined, for the purposes of this Atlas, using a threshold gross domestic product value of 15 OOO international dollars). At the second level, there are a large number ofTCAM therapies that appear to be more popular in high-income countries than low-income ones. These therapies are: acupuncture, homeopathy, osteopathy, chiropractic, massage, aromatherapy and spiritual healing. This analysis suggests that at some stage in a TCAM therapy's development, it becomes the preferred medicine of those who are economically better-off. It would appear that greater economic development may allow for health, lifestyle and value changes in higher-income countries, or groups within countries. These changes may also permit any possible dissatisfaction with conventional medical treatments to be voiced. The issues that are driving interest in TCAM in higher-income countries, as seen from a number of recent studies, are thatTCAM is considered to be more integrated or holistic than conventional medicine, is regarded as more congruent with a 'green' lifestyle, and is generally perceived as offering more satisfactory practitioner-patient interaction and care. The Global Atlas data show that TCAM is at a point of transition, as higher-income countries develop greater health and economic interest in TCAM. The data were analysed to determine the point of \"switch\", where TCAM ceases to be only a medicine for the poor and comes into demand as medicine for the better-off. We believe that we are at a point where the commonly-popular complementary and alternative medicines within industrialized countries (such as homeopathy, osteopathy and chiropractic) have already completed the transition to preferred medicines of the rich. What is perhaps more alarming is that market forces are driving certain traditional forms of health care towards the richer markets. This does not appear to have influenced the popularity of most herbal/traditional medicines, nor the Indian systems of medicine, which retain their affordability and popularity among low-and high-income countries. However, traditional Chinese medicine is clearly preferred by the wealthier nations globally. We speculate that this may have something to do with the spinning-off of acupuncture as a separate and valid profession, which has raised interest and investment in other areas of traditional Chinese medicine. Further editions of the Atlas should monitor this trend since it is possible that a continuation will result in neither allopathic medicine nor TCAM being affordable for populations within lower-income countries. In addition, TCAM resources could become stripped to service the demands of the market in the higher-income countries.

WHO GLOBAL ATLAS OF TRADITIONAL, COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MAP VOLUME ANNEX 2 TOWARDS A GLOBAL ATLAS OF TRADITIONAL/COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE UTILIZATION -PROVISIONAL INDICATORS FOR MONITORING TRADITIONAL, COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE USE* Torkel Falkenberg, Deputy Head/Researcher, Division of International Health, Department of Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institute, Sweden Aim and objective of the global TM/CAM utilization review A standardized approach to collecting and reviewing existing national TM/CAM utilization infor\u00ad mation is urgently needed. The nature and design of available primary data surveys vary, depending on a number of factors that need to be accounted for when presenting the results from the global review. This project will collect and review this type of information by means of standardized indi\u00ad cators related to TM/CAM utilization, based on already available information. The indicators will be developed and finalized as part of this project. The aim is to provide Member Scates with reliable and accurate TM/CAM information regarding: TM/CAM utilization in different countries and regions; of the prevalence of TM/CAM utilisation internationally; evidence-based policy-making based on empirical evidence of utilization; and assessing the impact of health sector reform and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions over time. Proposed indicators Each structural and process indicator is described with a brief statement chat includes: definition -the content of the indicator use -why the indicator is important and what it will measure description -the scope of the indicator and the definitions of key terms sources and methods of data collection and indicator calculation limitations -the limitations of the indicator. Provisional structural indicators ST 1. Is there an official national TM/CAM policy? Use. The indicator is used to assess the political commitment and the capability of the government to define the objectives of a TM/CAM policy and the activities that need co be undertaken for achieving these national objectives. A national policy is an expression of goals for improving the role of TM/CAM in national health care delivery systems, ensuring the creation of regulatory and legal mechanisms for promoting and maintaining good practice of effective TM/CAM therapies, and stimulating research and education efforts. Policies are also needed in order co respond to is\u00ad sues concerning the protection of indigenous traditional medicine knowledge and the protection of natural resources (such as medicinal planes) used in TM/CAM produces. Description. The national TM/CAM policy document is an officially approved document chat should be widely available. It should contain not only the key objectives of the national policy but also the main strategies proposed by the government for achieving those objectives. A national TM/CAM policy is different from an ace regulating the TM/CAM sector (see ST 2). Sources and methods for data collection. The national TM/CAM policy document should be available from the Ministry of Health. In certain cases the national TM/CAM policy is not a separate docu\u00ad ment but is part of a national drug policy or national health policy document. This article is reproduced from Annexure 1 of the background paper of the International Consultative Meeting: Global Information on Traditional Medicine/Complementary and Alternative Medicine Practices and Utilization, organized by the WHO Centre for Health Development, Kobe, Japan, 19-21 September 2001. 69 70 ANNEXES Limitations. Most countries will have no official national TM/CAM policy document, although some components of a policy may be in place. In this case, the indicator will not be appropriate and it will be useful to indicate the situation in the summary form. ST 2. Is there TM/CAM legislation? Use. This indicator is used to assess the existence of a legal framework for the TM/CAM sector. Government should enact legislation to ensure the safety, efficacy and quality of certain types of TM/CAM therapies and to regulate production, marketing and provision. Description. The principles of regulation of any health-care profession are to protect the public from unqualified or inadequately trained providers. The effective regulation of a therapy or product al\u00ad lows the public to understand where to look for safe treatment from well trained providers in an environment where their rights are protected. TM/CAM legislation describes the legal conditions under which such activities should be organized, and in line with the national TM/CAM policy if available. The indicator is answered Yes or No, with a few exceptions. The indicator should be answered in relation co the following. (a) Is TM/CAM provision in general subject to regulation of a general nature? (b) Are only certain forms of TM/CAM provision regulated (specify)? (c) Are all/certain TM/CAM providers legally recognized (specify)? (d) Which professional categories (conventional such as doctors, nurses and midwifes and/or TM/CAM providers such as chiropractors, osteopaths, homeopachs, etc.) are entitled to provide TM/CAM therapy (list professional category and TM/CAM therapy)? Sources and methods for data collection. The national TM/CAM legislation document(s) should be available from the Ministry of Health and/or the national TM/CAM centre and/or che medical product agency. Limitations. The existence of legislation does not imply chat the law is fully implemented. ST 3. Is there a ministry, institution or national expert committee whose mandate includes TM/CAM control, education, information and/or research? Use. This indicator is used to determine whether there is a formal and reliable mechanism in place for ensuring chat the necessary regulatory and legal mechanisms are created and implemented for promoting and maintaining good practice, chat access to TM/CAM is equitable, and chat the au\u00ad thenticity, safety and efficacy of certain therapies used are ensured. Ac the same time, it is impera\u00ad tive for guaranteeing the credibility and recognition of and respect for indigenous health systems. Should a separate professional and/or scientific TM/CAM association exist, this should be noted. Description. A ministry, national TM/CAM centre or national expert committee would be the ap\u00ad propriate authority co identify the steps and plans needed to formulate national policy in this area. The functions and activities should include developing the necessary regulatory and legal reforms co ensure good practice and extend the primary health care coverage, while ensuring the authenticity, safety and efficacy of these medicines. Drawing up of a national list of essential herbal medicines, preparing guidelines on registration requirements, advising on a national licensing systems, advis\u00ad ing on means of reporting adverse reactions, developing guidelines on competency and training for TM/CAM providers and informing conventional health care providers about TM/CAM are additional undertakings. The staff should be multidisciplinary and include TM/CAM providers or experts. Sources and methods for data collection. If a national TM/CAM centre or expert committee exists, it should be visited and information should be obtained on the types of activity performed. If there is no centre or committee, such information should be available from the Ministry of Health and/or the national medical products agency. This indicator should be analysed in conjunction with ST 1 and ST 2. WHO GLOBAL ATLAS OF TRADITIONAL, COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MAP VOLUME Limitations. This indicator should be analysed with caution, and will in many cases need to be ac\u00ad companied by written statements as to che kinds of mechanism and activity are in place and how these are being implemented. ST 4. Is there a national voluntary self-regulatory body for TM/CAM? Use. This indicator is used co determine whether there is an effective voluntary self-regulatory body for certain TM/CAM therapies. Description. A voluntary self-regulating mechanism, preferably administered by a single professional body, has been described as enough co protect patients and organize che providers of some therapies (1). Eicher, bodies concerned with specific TM/CAM therapies or an umbrella organization encom\u00ad passing all such bodies who fulfil certain criteria may exist. Features of an effective, voluntary, self-regulating professional body include (2): maintaining a register of individual members or member organizations; setting educational standards and running an accreditation system for training establish\u00ad ments; maintaining professional competence among ics members with an adequate programme of continuing professional development; providing codes of conduct, ethics and practice; maintaining a complaints mechanism for members of the public; maintaining a system of disciplinary procedure chat is accessible co che public; requiring members to have adequate professional indemnity insurance; having capacity co represent the whole profession; and including external representation on the executive councils co represent patients or clients and the wider public interest. Sources and methods for data collection. If a national TM/CAM centre or expert committee exists, it should be visited and information should be obtained related to the five most commonly used TM/CAM therapies. If there is no centre or committee, information should be available from the respective TM/CAM organizations in che country. This indicator should be assessed in conjunction with ST 3 and PR 2. Limitations. There exists considerable variation in levels of professionalization within the TM/CAM world. Even within some distinct therapeutic disciplines there may be considerable fragmentation, sometimes resulting in several bodies, each with different training and educational requirements, codes of practice and complaints procedures. Hence, this indicator should be analysed with caution and will in many cases need to be accompanied by written statements as to the kinds of voluntary self-regulation in place for relevant types of TM/CAM therapies. ST 5. Are there any financing systems that contribute to the provision of certain TM/CAM therapies in the public sector? Use. This indicator is used co determine whether there are financing mechanisms to increase the provision of TM/CAM in che public sector and therefore to increase coverage. A few countries have developed financing systems to cover completely or partially the costs of services of certain TM/CAM therapies. Description. Financing systems are defined as any system that, in the public sector, contribute to the provision of services of any TM/CAM therapy by charging patients or the community. Public finance is understood as general government revenues and compulsory health insurance (sometimes known as social insurance) that is either publicly managed or heavily regulated by governments. Private finance includes out-of-pocket payments and voluntary health insurance. These systems can provide complete or partial coverage of the cost of the therapy. The indicator should be analysed in conjunction with PR 7. Whether or not a medical therapy is referred to as traditional, comple-71 72 ANNEXES mentary, alternative or integrated depends on the current national definitions and may vary from country to country. Sources and methods for data collection. The information can be obtained through interviews at the Ministry of Health. The indicator is answered Yes or No. ST 6. Is there a TM/CAM user survey conducted in the country in the past twenty years? Use. This indicator is used to determine whether surveys exist on use among the public of common TM/CAM therapies available on the public and/or private market. Description. The procedures for surveys may differ from one country to another, but most likely include the following elements: definitions of TM/CAM; utilization rates of certain nationally available TM/CAM therapies and providers over a lifetime and/or 12-month perspective; availabil\u00ad ity; affordability; quality; and consumer satisfaction. The legal framework, policy development and implementation, national strategies for cooperation and/or integration with conventional medicine could also be assessed. Sources and methods for data collection. The information will be available from the Ministry of Health, national TM/CAM centres and/or national TM/CAM organization(s), and can be ob\u00ad tained through interviews and by reviewing various survey documents. All the identified surveys should be listed, including the full reference to the study. ST 7. Is there a TRM educational school in the formal education system? Use. This indicator is used to determine whether there is/are established educational institution(s) either in the public or the private sector. The presence of a formal education system suggests or implies recognition of the TRM system in the country and this in turn would facilitate its develop\u00ad ment. Training of human resources in planning of the health sector, delivery of health services as well as regulation and legislation pertaining to the TRM can be planned and implemented. Description. In countries where a TRM system has evolved over centuries, the method of teaching by apprenticeship is being replaced by formal institutional training in the public and/or the private sector. At present, schools, institutes and even universities exists for training of the undergraduate and post-graduate students in the various systems of TRM and CAM. With resurgence of interest and increase in the utilization ofTCAM all over the world, even schools of modern medicine in the developed countries are having seminars and elective courses in preparing future medical doctors and physicians to better care for their patients. Sources and methods of data collection. The information can be available from the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and/or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as professional associations existing within the country or internally. Such information is published officially by the government, NGOs and by the respective schools, institutions and universities in the form of pro\u00ad spectus, brochures, booklets or pamphlets. Increasingly, such information is also available through the Internet in the websites of the educational organizations. ST 8. Survey quality assessment indicator Use. Primary data already collected through national or regional TM/CAM utilization levels will be analysed. However, when assessing already collected information retrospectively, certain additional information must be provided such as the reliability of the results, the objectives underlying the survey, the methods used, how TM/CAM was defined, etc. These \"qualities\" will be compared with international standards for this type of data and will greatly facilitate cross-national comparisons. Description. See the survey quality assessment form below. Sources and methods for data collection. The information can usually be found in the materials and methods section of the report, and/or can be obtained through interviews with the principal investigator(s). This indicator should be assessed in conjunction with ST 6. Limitations. Some of the information requested may not be available.

Estimated prevalence of national TM/CAM use Use. This indicator is used to assess the prevalence of TM/CAM use based on existing national population-based surveys performed over the previous 20 years. Description. Surveys in the TM/CAM field may exist in many different forms and may assess various variables. For the purpose of this study, the inclusion criteria are that the study used survey methods to estimate the extent of TM/CAM use among the general population, and that the prevalence of TM/CAM utilization is expressed in figures so that an estimate for the general population can be provided. A study should be excluded if it estimated only the prevalence of a single therapy or was a profession/patient-based survey, i.e. not representative of the general population. When provided, estimates of the following should be recorded separately. PR 1.1 Total usage (visits and self-medication) of TM/CAM in combination with conventional medicine or alone for: (a) the treatment of a disease/health condition and for prevention and/or the maintenance of health; (b) the treatment of a disease; or (c) prevention and/or the maintenance of health. PR 1.2 Visits to a TM/CAM provider in combination with conventional medicine or alone for: (a) the treatment of a disease/health condition and for prevention and/or maintenance of health; (b) the treatment of a disease; or (c) prevention and/or the maintenance of health. PR 1.3 Self-medication with TM/CAM medication or procedure-based therapies in combination with conventional medicine or alone for: (a) the treatment of a disease/health condition and for prevention and/or the maintenance of health; (b) the treatment of a disease; or (c) prevention and/or the maintenance of health. Sources and methods for data collection. The information will be available from the Ministry of Health, national TM/CAM centres and/or national TM/CAM organization(s), and can be ob\u00ad tained through interviews and by reviewing various survey documents. All the identified surveys should be listed, including the full reference to the study. In the case of several investigations being present, each survey should be noted using ST 6, but only the most recent one(s) having results of acceptable reliability (as determined through, for example, ST 8) needs to be assessed using the process indicators. PR 2. Estimated prevalence of the five most popular individual therapies used Use. This indicator is used to assess the prevalence of the use of individual TM/CAM therapies, based on existing national population-based surveys performed over the previous 20 years. Description. If respondents have been asked about their use of individual TM/CAM therapies, whether presented as a list of therapies or not, estimates the prevalence of use of individual therapies can be provided. This information can be used to list the five most important therapies in the coun\u00ad try. For the purpose of this study the same inclusion criteria will apply as for PR 1: the study, used survey methods to estimate the extent of TM/CAM use among the general population, and the WHO GLOBAL ATLAS OF TRADITIONAL, COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MAP VOLUME prevalence of TM/CAM utilization is expressed in figures so that an estimate for the general popu\u00ad lation can be provided. A study should be excluded if it estimated only the prevalence of a single therapy or was a profession/patient-based survey, i.e. not representative of the general population. When provided, estimates of the following should be recorded separately. PR 2.1 Total usage (visits and self-medication) of individual (top 5) TM/CAM therapies for: (a) the treatment of a disease and for prevention and/or maintenance of health; (b) the treatment of a disease; or (c) prevention and/or the maintenance of health. PR 2.2 Visits to individual (top 5) TM/CAM therapy providers for: (a) the treatment of a disease and for prevention and/or the maintenance of health; (b) the treatment of a disease; or (c) prevention and/or the maintenance of health. PR 2.3 Self-medication with individual (top 5) TM/CAM therapies (medication or procedure-based therapies) for: (a) the treatment of a disease and for prevention and/or the maintenance of health; (b) the treatment of a disease; or (c) prevention and/or the maintenance of health. Sources and methods for data collection. The information will be available from the Ministry of Health, national TM/CAM centres and/or national TM/CAM organization(s), and can be ob\u00ad tained through interviews and by reviewing various survey documents. All the identified surveys should be listed, including the full reference to the study. In the case of several investigations being present, each survey should be noted using ST 6 but only the most recent one(s) having results of acceptable reliability (as determined through, for example, ST 7) needs to be assessed using the process indicators. PR 3. Estimated prevalence of national herbal medicine use Use. This indicator is used to assess the prevalence of the use of herbal medicine, based on existing national population-based surveys performed over the past 20 years. Description. Surveys of the herbal medicine field may exist in many different forms and many assess various variables. For the purpose of this study, the inclusion criteria are that the study used survey methods to estimate the extent of herbal medicine use (in a few countries also included as \"dietary supplement\") among the general population, and that the prevalence of herbal medicine utiliza\u00ad tion is expressed in figures so that an estimate for the general population can be provided. A study should be excluded if it was a profession/patient-based survey, i.e. not representative of the general population. When provided, estimates of the following should be recorded separately. PR 3.1 Total usage (visits and self-medication) of herbal medicine for either; (a) the treatment of a disease and for prevention/maintenance of health; (b) the treatment of a disease; or (c) prevention and/or the maintenance of health. PR 3.2 Visits to a provider of herbal medicines for: (a) the treatment of a disease and for prevention and/or the maintenance of health; (b) the treatment of a disease; or (c) prevention and/or the maintenance of health. 75 76 ANNEXES PR 3.3 Self-medication with herbal medicines for; (a) the treatment of a disease and for prevention and/or the maintenance of health; (b) the treatment of a disease; or (c) prevention and/or the maintenance of health. Sources and methods for data collection. The information will be available from the Ministry of Health, national TM/CAM centres and/or national TM/CAM organization(s), and can be ob\u00ad tained through interviews and by reviewing various survey documents. All the identified surveys should be listed, including the full reference to the study. In the case of several investigations being present, each survey should be noted using ST 6, but only the most recent one(s) having results of acceptable reliability (as determined through, for example, ST 7) needs to be assessed using the process indicators. PR 4. Medical determinants for TM/CAM use Use. Many surveys of TM/CAM utilization also assess the reasons for use in terms of health-seeking behaviour, patient satisfaction or outcome of treatment. This core indicator will assess only a few determinants of TM/CAM use. Description. Reasons for TM/CAM utilization cover a broad spectrum of health problems, as well as preventive measures and general interest. Admittedly, many critical questions in TM/CAM use have to do with whether users and providers follow appropriate diagnostic procedures, and whether they select therapies and dosages to fit underlying health problems. However, determining the quality of adequacy or health-seeking behaviour is complex and lends itself to an additional and more health-problem-specific investigation. The determinants for the use of TM/CAM may be as\u00ad sociated with a number of diagnosed chronic or acute illnesses, or the respondent using TM/CAM may be free of any disease and may use it for preventive reasons or may just be interested. It is also possible that the respondents may use both TM/CAM and conventional medical therapies to treat the same condition. Provided below are a number of possible sets of questions likely to have been posed in some surveys. When provided, information on the following should be recorded separately. PR 4.1 Total usage (visits and self-medication) of a specific TM/CAM therapy for: (a) which type of health condition(3)? (b) which type of health condition, in combination with conventional health care? PR 4.2 Visits to a specific TM/CAM provider for: (a) which type of health condition? (b) which type of health condition, in combination with conventional health care? PR 4.3 Self-medication with specific TM/CAM medication or procedure based therapies for: (a) which type of health condition? (b) which type of health condition, in combination with conventional health care? Sources and methods for data collection. The information will be available from the Ministry of Health, national centres for TM/CAM and/or national TM/CAM organization(s), and can be obtained through interviews and reviewing various survey documents. All the identified surveys should be listed, including the full reference to the study. Limitations. Not all variables of interest listed above may be available or presented in the report(s) assessed. PR 5. Patient satisfaction and perceived outcome of TM/CAM treatment Use. Popularity ofTM/CAM has been attributed to a few general factors: (a) greater availability and affordability compared to conventional health care in developing countries; (b) dissatisfaction with WHO GLOBAL ATLAS OF TRADITIONAL, COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MAP VOLUME the side-effects and limited success of conventional health care in treating some chronic and painful conditions; and (c) preference for a more personal and holistic care. Hence a few internationally published surveys of TM/CAM utilization also assess the outcome of use in terms of being on the level of patient satisfaction or as change in self-perceived health. Description. The assessment of perceived outcome of consultation or treatment with TM/CAM may be associated with a number of possible sets of questions likely to have been posed in the survey. PR 5.1 Patient satisfaction (4) with: (a) total usage (visits and self-medication) of TM/CAM therapies; (b) total usage (visits and self-medication) of a specific TM/CAM therapy; (c) visits to TM/CAM providers in general; (d) visits to a specific TM/CAM provider; (e) self-medication TM/CAM medication(s) or (f) self-medication with a specific TM/CAM medication or procedure-based therapy. PR 5.2 Perceived patient outcome for general health status following: (a) total usage (visits and self-medication) of TM/CAM therapies; (b) total usage (visits and self-medication) of a specific TM/CAM therapy; (c) visits to TM/CAM providers in general; (d) visits to a specific provider; (e) self-medication with TM/CAM medication(s) or procedure-based therapies in (d) self-medication with a specific TM/CAM medication or procedure-based therapies. PR 5.3 Perceived patient outcome (5) for separate health conditions following: (a) total usage (visits and self-medication) of TM/CAM therapies; (b) total usage (visits and self-medication) of a specific TM/CAM therapy; (c) visits to TM/CAM providers in general; (d) visits to a specific TM/CAM provider; (e) self-medication TM/CAM medication(s) or (f) self-medication with a specific TM/CAM medication or procedure-based therapy. Sources and methods for data collection. In the case of several investigations being present, each survey should be reported provided that they complement each other and are of acceptable reliability (as determined through, for example, ST 7). Limitations. Not all variables of interest listed above may be available or presented in the report(s) assessed. PR 6. Sociodemographic characteristics of consumers associated with use of TM/CAM Use. Qualitative and quantitative research in developed countries have shown that people who con\u00ad sult TM/CAM providers usually have long-standing conditions for which conventional medicine has not provided a satisfactory solution (6,7). Other reasons, such as affordability and availability, are additional important factors in developing countries. Moreover, characteristics such as sex, race, education, age group, self-rated health and income may influence the level of use. The aim of this indicator is to describe \"who\" uses TM/CAM by assessing a few characteristics associated with its use, provided that this has been analyzed in the identified survey(s). Description. Surveys assessing certain qualities of TM/CAM consumers may exist in many different forms and many assess various variables. Presented below are a number of areas and variables assessed 77 78 ANNEXES in a few previously published investigations. When the characteristics of chose who have used TM/ CAM compared with non-users are presented, these should be recorded separately. If patterns of use have been analyzed statistically, this should be noted and presented, for example, a study has found - use -co be significantly more common among women (48.9%) than men (37.8%) (P = 0.001) (8). PR 6.1 Usage (visits and self-medication) of TM/CAM associated with certain sociodemographic characteristics: (a) Age (b) Economic status (normally self-assessed) (c) Education (d) Income (e) Availability (f) Affordability (g) Racial groups (h) Urban vs. rural population (i) Regional differences (j) Health status (normally self-raced)?

PR 6.3 Self-medication with TM/CAM medication or procedure-based therapies associated with certain sociodemographic characteristics of consumers, including the categories listed above. Sources and methods for data collection. These are the same as for PR 1. This indicator should be analyzed in conjunction with PR 1, PR 2 and PR 4. PR 7. Total out-of-pocket payments and total national expenditure estimates for TM/CAM utilization Use. In addition to prevalence figures, out-of-pocket expenditure for TM/CAM is important in describing its significance. Total national costs for TM/CAM utilization are equally important and have sometimes also been assessed in the few surveys published internationally. Description. The assessment of coses for TM/CAM may be associated with a number of possible sets of questions. When provided, information on the following should be recorded separately. PR 7.1 Total out-of-pocket (9) spending for: (a) total usage (visits and self-medication) for TM/CAM; (b) total usage (visits and self-medication) of a specific TM/CAM therapy; (c) visits to a specific TM/CAM provider; with TM/CAM medication or procedure-based self-medication with a specific TM/CAM medication or procedure-based therapy. PR 7 .2 Total national spending for: (a) total usage (visits and self-medication) for TM/CAM; (b) total usage (visits and self-medication) of a specific TM/CAM therapy; (c) visits co a specific TM/CAM provider; WHO GLOBAL ATLAS OF TRADITIONAL, COMPLEMENTARY ANO ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MAP VOLUME (d) self-medication with TM/CAM medication or procedure-based therapies; (e) self-medication with a specific TM/CAM medication or procedure-based therapy. Sources and methods for data collection. The information will be available from the Ministry of Health, national TM/CAM centres and/or national TM/CAM organizacion(s), and can be ob\u00ad tained through interviews and by reviewing various survey documents. All the identified surveys should be listed, including the full reference to the study. The total national cost of selected forms of TM/CAM use can be determined by calculating the number of visits, self-medication or herbal medicine use (when presented separately) and by multiplying this with the total number of visits or occasions of use for each form of TM/CAM and by an average per visit per use. Out-of-pocket coses can be constructed for each therapy by multiplying the average full price per visit or per use by a set fraction (corresponding to insurance coverage out of the total cost) if the user had partial insurance, or by zero if insurance paid the full price of the visit. Alternatively, when respondents estimate their own yearly out-of-pocket coses, the median coses can be multiplied with the national prevalence rate of use of the specific TM/CAM therapy and the national population. Out-of-pocket coses for herbal medicines can be calculated by multiplying the coral population of users by the average cost of herbal medicines per capita per year, provided chat no insurance covers herbals. This indicator should be analyzed in conjunction with PR 1, PR 2 and ST 5. Limitations. Not all variables of interest listed above may be available or presented in the reporc(s) assessed.
