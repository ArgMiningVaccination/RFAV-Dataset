BMC Med Res Methodol ; 23(1): 137, 10. em ID: covidwho-20236431 ABSTRACT BACKGROUND:Determining the [vaccine effectiveness](VE) is of studying every new [vaccine]. Test-negative case-control (TNCC) studies have recently been used to determine the VE. However, the estimated VE derived from a TNCC design depends on the test [sensitivity and specificity]. Herein, a [method]for correction of the value of VE derived from a TNCC study is presented. METHODS:An analytical [method]is presented to compute the corrected VE based on the [sensitivity and specificity]of the [diagnostic test]utilized. To show the application of the [method]proposed, a hypothetical TNCC study is presented. In this in silico study, 100 000 individuals referring to a [healthcare system]for COVID-19-like illness were tested with [diagnostic tests]with sensitivities of 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0, and specificities ranging from 0.85 to 1.00. A [vaccination coverage]of 60%, an [attack rate]of 0.05 for COVID-19 in unvaccinated group, and a true VE of 0.70, were assumed. In this simulation, a COVID-19-like illness with an [attack rate]of 0.30 could also [affect]all the studied [population]regardless [vaccination]status. RESULTS:The observed VE ranged from 0.11 (computed for [sensitivity]of 0.60 and [specificity]of 0.71 (computed for a test [sensitivity and specificity]of 1.0). The mean computed corrected VE derived from the proposed [method]was 0.71 (the standard deviation of 0.02). CONCLUSIONS:The observed VE derived from TNCC studies can be corrected easily. An acceptable estimate for VE can be computed regardless of the [diagnostic test] "}
