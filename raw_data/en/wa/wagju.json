They have excellent health and skin without seeming to do anything! Well, all you need to do is use some of nature's gifts to get mommy superpowers! Let's take a look... Superpower #1 - Youthful Skin Ever seen a superhero look old? No, right? But you are a mom and your baby's antics can make you so tired that you look older than you are! The good news is that you can now get youthful, glowing skin - yes, even after pregnancy and childbirth.

In the Herbs & More range, for instance,Netsurf has infused the power of pure herbs, vitamins and fruit extracts to cater to all your skin and haircare needs. This makes it safe, gentle and effective for application. Superpower #2 - Strong Body It's a common fact that all superheroes have strong bodies that are able to recover from just about any damage.Makes you wonder whether they hardly feel pain, right? But being a mom, it's natural that you have intense muscular pain because of running around all day, particularly in your back and joints.Well, fret not! You can depend upon the goodness of herbs such as Nirgudi, Vacha and Gandhapura. As per ancient medicine, these herbs are very effective in relieving aches and pains - exactly what a mom needs!Nirgudi relaxes your muscles, Vacha relieves joint pain, and Gandhapura ensures overall pain relief. Now you too can be as quick as your favourite superhero when your child is being particularly energetic!

But who said that means you have to look like a zombie with tired, puffy eyes and huge dark circles?You can get back your beautiful eyes by treating the under-eye skin to natural ingredients such as cocoa extract, chicory extract, and Vitamin E and C.These ingredients have been known to reduce puffiness around the eyes and visibly clean dark circles and other signs of ageing and tiredness.Try out Herbs & More's Vitamin Therapy Under Eye Gel. It is part of Netsurf's range of natural skincare products and caters especially to common problems women face in the postpartum and new mom stage.
