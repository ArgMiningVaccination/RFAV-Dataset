Hydrocortisone is a steroid medicine that is used to treat many different conditions, including allergic disorders, skin conditions, ulcerative colitis, arthritis, lupus, lung disorders, and certain blood cell disorders such as anemia (low red blood cells) or thrombocytopenia (low platelets). Hydrocortisone is also used to replace steroids in people with adrenal insufficiency (decreased production of natural steroids by the adrenal glands). Hydrocortisone is also used in the treatment of certain cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Alkindi Sprinkle is approved for use in people from birth to 17 years of age.
