Dr Kokayi feels that the human condition and state of the environment is largely the product of an ongoing human state of awareness that is narrow in perspective and limiting with respect to what is possible and what is truly important. Humanity must have a state of Consciousness that at least gives rise to an \"open heart\", where our differences are to be celebrated and we experience ourselves as part of a living system of Cosmic origin. Without the evolution of the human spirit, so that we see ourselves as Spiritual Beings having a Human experience, this round of humanity will not thrive.
