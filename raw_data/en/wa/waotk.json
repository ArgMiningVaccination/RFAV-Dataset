Hethcote Abstract. Many models for the spread of infectious diseases in populations have been analyzed math- ematically and applied to specic diseases. Threshold theorems involving the basic repro-duction number R 0, the contact number , and the replacement number Rare reviewed for the classic SIR epidemic and endemic models. Similar results with new expressions forR 0are obtained for MSEIR and SEIR endemic models with either continuous age or age groups. Values of R0andare estimated for various diseases including measles in Niger and pertussis in the United States. Previous models with age structure, heterogeneity, andspatial structure are surveyed. Key words. thresholds, basicreproductionnumber, PII.S0036144500371907 of sanitation, antibiotics, and vac- cination programs created a condence in the 1960s that infectious diseases wouldsoon be eliminated. Consequently, chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease andcancer received more attention in the United States and industrialized countries. Butinfectious diseases have continued to be the major causes of suering and mortalityin developing countries. Moreover, infectious disease agents adapt and evolve, so thatnewinfectiousdiseaseshaveemergedandsomeexistingdiseaseshavereemerged[142].Newly identied diseases include Lyme disease (1975), Legionnaire's disease (1976),toxic-shock syndrome (1978), hepatitis C (1989), hepatitis E (1990), and hantavirus(1993). The human immunodeciency virus (HIV), which is the etiological agentfor acquired immunodeciency syndrome (AIDS), emerged in 1981 and has becomean important sexually transmitted disease throughout the world. Antibiotic-resistantstrainsoftuberculosis, pneumonia, andgonorrheahaveevolved. Malaria, dengue, andyellow fever have reemerged and are spreading into new regions as climate changesoccur. Diseases such as plague, cholera, and hemorrhagic fevers (Bolivian, Ebola,Lassa, Marburg, etc.) continue to erupt occasionally. Surprisingly, new infectiousagents called prions have recently joined the previously known agents: viruses, bac-teria, protozoa, and helminths (worms). There is strong evidence that thecause in sheep[168]. Recent popular books have given us exciting accounts of the emergence and de-tection of new diseases [82, 168, 170, 183].

HETHCOTE of new ecosystems, global warming, environmental degradation, increased interna- tional travel, and changes in economic patterns will continue to provide opportunitiesfor new and existing infectious diseases [152]. The emerging and reemerging diseases have led to a revived interest in infec- tious diseases. Mathematical models have become important tools in analyzing thespread and control of infectious diseases. The model formulation process claries as-sumptions, variables, and parameters; moreover, models provide conceptual resultssuch as thresholds, basic reproduction numbers, contact numbers, and replacementnumbers. Mathematical models and computer simulations are useful experimentaltools for building and testing theories, assessing quantitative conjectures, answer-ing specic questions, determining sensitivities to changes in parameter values, andestimating key parameters from data. Understanding the transmission characteris-tics of infectious diseases in communities, regions, and countries can lead to betterapproaches to decreasing the transmission of these diseases. Mathematical modelsare used in comparing, planning, implementing, evaluating, and optimizing variousdetection, prevention, therapy, and control programs. Epidemiology modeling cancontribute to the design and analysis of epidemiological surveys, suggest crucial datathat should be collected, identify trends, make general forecasts, and estimate theuncertainty in forecasts [100, 111]. Although a model for smallpox was formulated and solved by Daniel Bernoulli in 1760 in order to evaluate the eectiveness of variolation of healthy people withthe smallpox virus [24], deterministic epidemiology modeling seems to have startedin the 20th century. In 1906 Hamer formulated and analyzed a discrete time modelin his attempt to understand the recurrence of measles epidemics [95]. His modelmay have been the rst to assume that the incidence (number of new cases per unittime) depends on the product of the densities of the susceptibles and infectives. Rosswas interested in the incidence and control of malaria, so he developed dierentialequation models for malaria as a host-vector disease in 1911 [173]. Other determin-istic epidemiology models were then developed in papers by Ross, Ross and Hudson,Martini, and Lotka [18, 60, 66]. Starting in 1926 Kermack and McKendrick publishedpapers on epidemic models and obtained the epidemic threshold result that the den-sity of susceptibles must exceed a critical value in order for an epidemic outbreak tooccur [18, 136, 157]. Mathematical epidemiology seems to have grown exponentiallystarting in the middle of the 20th century (the rst edition in 1957 of Bailey's book[18] is an important landmark), so that a tremendous variety of models have nowbeen formulated, mathematically analyzed, and applied to infectious diseases. Re-views of the literature [21, 39, 60, 65, 67, 102, 107, 109, 199] show the rapid growthof epidemiology modeling. The recent models have involved aspects such as passiveimmunity, gradual loss of vaccine and disease-acquired immunity, stages of infection,vertical transmission, disease vectors, macroparasitic loads, age structure, social andsexual mixing groups, spatial spread, vaccination, quarantine, and chemotherapy.Special models have been formulated for diseases such as measles, rubella, chicken-pox, whooping cough, herpes, syphilis, and HIV/AIDS. The breadth of the subject is shown inthe books on epidemiology modeling [5, 9, 12, 18, 19, 20, 22, 33, 38, 39, 55, 56, 59,80, 81, 90, 111, 113, 127, 137, 141, 151, 164, 167, 173, 181, 194, 196]. Compartments with labels such as M, S, E, I, and R are often used for the epidemiological classes as shown in Figure 1.

The class M contains these infants with passive immunity. After the maternal antibodies disappear from the body, the in-fant moves to the susceptible class S. Infants who do not have any passive immunity,because their mothers were never infected, also enter the class S of susceptible indi-viduals; that is, those who can become infected. When there is an adequate contactof a susceptible with an infective so that transmission occurs, then the susceptibleenters the exposed class E of those in the latent period, who are infected but not yetinfectious. After the latent period ends, the individual enters the class I of infectives,who are infectious in the sense that they are capable of transmitting the infection.Whentheinfectiousperiodends, theindividualenterstherecoveredclassRconsistingof those with permanent infection-acquired immunity. The choice of which compartments to include in a model depends on the charac- teristics of the particular disease being modeled and the purpose of the model. Thepassively immune class M and the latent period class E are often omitted, becausethey are not crucial for the susceptible-infective interaction. Acronyms for epidemi-ology models are often based on the flow patterns between the compartments such asMSEIR, MSEIRS, SEIR, SEIRS, SIR, SIRS, SEI, SEIS, SI, and SIS. For example, inthe MSEIR model shown in Figure 1, passively immune newborns rst become sus-ceptible, then exposed in the latent period, then infectious, and then removed withpermanent immunity. An MSEIRS model would be similar, but the immunity in theRclasswouldbetemporary, sothatindividualswouldregaintheirsusceptibilitywhenthe temporary immunity ended. The threshold for many epidemiology models is the basic reproduction number R 0, which is dened as the average number of secondary infections produced when one infected individual is introduced into a host population where everyone is suscep-tible [61]. For many deterministic epidemiology models, an infection can get startedin a fully susceptible population if and only if R 0>1. Thus the basic reproduc- tion number R0is often considered as the threshold quantity that determines when an infection can invade and persist in a new host population. Section 2 introducesepidemiology modeling by formulating and analyzing two classic deterministic mod-els. The role of R 0is demonstrated for the classic SIR endemic model in section 2.4. Then thresholds are estimated from data on several diseases and the implications ofthe estimates are considered for diseases such as smallpox, polio, measles, rubella,chickenpox, and influenza. An MSEIR endemic model in a population without agestructure but with exponentially changing population size is formulated and analyzedin section 3. This model demonstrates how exponential population growth aects thebasic reproduction number R 0.

These epidemiologic models are based on the demographic models in section 4 with eithercontinuous age or age groups. The two demographic models demonstrate the roleof the population reproduction numbers in determining when the population growsasymptotically exponentially. The MSEIR with continuous age structure is formu-lated and analyzed in section 5. New general expressions for the basic reproductionnumberR 0and the average age of infection Aare obtained. Expressions for these quantities are found in sections 5.4 and 5.6 in the cases when the survival function ofthe population is a negative exponential and a step function. In section 5.5 the en-demicthresholdandtheaverageageofinfectionareobtainedwhenvaccinationoccursat ageA v. The SEIR model with age groups is formulated and analyzed in section 6. The new expressions for the basic reproduction number R0and the average age of infectionAare analogous to those obtained for the MSEIR model with continuous age structure. The theoretical expressions in section 6 are used in section 7 to obtain estimates of the basic reproduction number R0and the average age of infection Afor measles in Niger, Africa. These estimates are aected by the very rapid 3.3% growth of thepopulation in Niger. In section 8 estimates of the basic reproduction number R 0and the contact number (dened in section 2.2) are obtained for pertussis (whooping cough) in the United States. Because pertussis infectives with lower infectivity occurin previously infected people, the contact number at the endemic steady state is less than the basic reproduction number R 0. Section 9 describes results on the basic reproductionnumber R0forpreviousepidemiologymodelswithavarietyofstructures, and section 10 contains a general discussion. 2. Two Classic Epidemiology Models. In order to introduce the terminology, notation, and standard results for epidemiology models, two classic SIR models areformulated and analyzed. Epidemic models are used to describe rapid outbreaks thatoccur in less than one year, while endemic models are used for studying diseases overlonger periods, during which there is a renewal of susceptibles by births or recoveryfrom temporary immunity. The two classic SIR models provide an intuitive basis forunderstanding more complex epidemiology modeling results. 2.1. FormulatingEpidemiologyModels. ThehorizontalincidenceshowninFig- ure 1 is the infection rate of susceptible individuals through their contacts with infec-tives. IfS(t) is the number of susceptibles at time t,I(t) is the number of infectives, andNis the total population size, then s(t)=S(t)/Nandi(t)=I(t)/Nare the susceptible and infectious fractions, respectively. If is the average number of ad- equate contacts (i.e., contacts sucient for transmission) of a person per unit time,thenI/N=iis the average number of contacts with infectives per unit time of one susceptible, and ( I/N)S=Nisis the number of new cases per unit time due to theS=Nssusceptibles. This form of the horizontal incidence is called the standard incidence, because it is formulated from the basic principles above [96, 102]. Thesimplemassactionlaw IS=(Ni)(Ns), withasamassactioncoecient, has sometimes been used for the horizontal incidence. The parameter has no direct epidemiological interpretation, but comparing it with the standard formulation showsthat=N, so that this form implicitly assumes that the contact rate increases linearly with the population size. Naively, it might seem plausible that the populationdensity and hence the contact rate would increase with population size, but the dailycontactpatternsofpeopleareoftensimilarinlargeandsmallcommunities, cities, andregions. For human diseases the contact rate seems to be only very weakly dependent Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php THE MATHEMATICS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES 603 on the population size. Using an incidence of the form NvSI/N, data for ve human diseases in communities with population sizes from 1,000 to 400,000 [9, p. 157] [12,p.306]implythat visbetween0.03and0.07. Thisstronglysuggeststhatthestandard incidence corresponding to v= 0 is more realistic for human diseases than the simple mass action incidence corresponding to v=1.This result is consistent with the concept that people are infected through their daily encounters and the patterns ofdaily encounters are largely independent of community size within a given country(e.g., students of the same age in a country usually have a similar number of dailycontacts). The standard incidence is also a better formulation than the simple mass action law for animal populations such as mice in a mouse-room or animals in a herd [57],because disease transmission primarily occurs locally from nearby animals. For moreinformation about the dierences in models using these two forms of the horizontalincidence, see [83, 84, 85, 96, 110, 159]. Vertical incidence, which is the infectionrate of newborns by their mothers, is sometimes included in epidemiology models byassuming that a xed fraction of the newborns is infected vertically [33]. Models withpopulation size-dependent contact functions have also been considered [29, 171, 190,191, 201]. Various forms of nonlinear incidences have been considered [112, 147, 148,149]. See [107] for a survey of mechanisms including nonlinear incidences that canlead to periodicity in epidemiological models. A common assumption is that the movements out of the M, E, and I compart- ments and into the next compartment are governed by terms like M,DepsilonwE, andIin an ordinary dierential equations model. It has been shown [109] that these termscorrespond to exponentially distributed waiting times in the compartments. For ex-ample, the transfer rate Icorresponds to P(t)=e tas the fraction that is still in the infective class tunits after entering this class and to 1 /as the mean wait- ing time. For measles the mean period 1 /of passive immunity is about six to nine months, while the mean latent period 1 /is one to two weeks and the mean infec- tious period 1 /is about one week. Another possible assumption is that the fraction still in the compartment tunits after entering is a nonincreasing, piecewise contin- uous function P(t) withP(0) = 1 and P() = 0. Then the rate of leaving the compartment at time tisP/prime(t), so the mean waiting time in the compartment is/integraltext 0t(P/prime(t))dt=/integraltext 0P(t)dt. These distributed delays lead to epidemiology models with integral or integrodierential or functional dierential equations. If the waitingtime distribution is a step function given by P(t)=1i f0 t, andP(t)=0 ift, then the mean waiting time is , and fortthe model reduces to a delay-dierential equation [109]. Each waiting time in a model can have a dierentdistribution, so there are many possible models [102]. 2.2. ThreeThresholdQuantities: R 0,,andR.The basic reproduction num- berR0has been dened in the introduction as the average number of secondary infections that occur when one infective is introduced into a completely susceptiblehost population [61]. Note that R 0is also called the basic reproduction ratio [58] or basic reproductive rate [12]. It is implicitly assumed that the infected outsider is inthehostpopulationfortheentireinfectiousperiodandmixeswiththehostpopulationin exactly the same way that a population native would mix. The contact number is dened as the average number of adequate contacts of a typical infective during theinfectious period [96, 110]. An adequate contact is one that is sucient for transmis-sion, if the individual contacted by the susceptible is an infective. The replacementnumberRis dened to be the average number of secondary infections produced by a Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226.

M Passively immune infants S Susceptibles E Exposed people in the latent period I Infectives R Recovered people with immunity m, s, e, i, r Fractions of the population in the classes above Contact rate 1/ Average period of passive immunity 1/ Average latent period 1/ Average infectious period R0 Basic reproduction number Contact number R Replacement number typical infective during the entire period of infectiousness [96]. Some authors use the term reproduction number instead of replacement number, but it is better to avoidthe name reproduction number since it is easily confused with the basic reproductionnumber. Note that these three quantities R 0,, andRin Table 1 are all equal at the beginning of the spread of an infectious disease when the entire population (exceptthe infective invader) is susceptible. In recent epidemiological modeling literature, thebasic reproduction number R 0is often used as the threshold quantity that determines whether a disease can invade a population. AlthoughR0is only dened at the time of invasion, andRare dened at all times. For most models, the contact number remains constant as the infection spreads, so it is always equal to the basic reproduction number R0. In these models andR0can be used interchangeably and invasion theorems can be stated in terms of either quantity. But for the pertussis models in section 8, the contact number becomes less than the basic reproduction number R0after the invasion, because new classes of infectives with lower infectivity appear when the disease has entered thepopulation. The replacement number Ris the actual number of secondary cases from a typical infective, so that after the infection has invaded a population and everyone isno longer susceptible, Ris always less than the basic reproduction number R 0. Also, after the invasion, the susceptible fraction is less than 1, so that not all adequatecontacts result in a new case. Thus the replacement number Ris always less than the contact number after the invasion. Combining these results leads to R 0R, with equality of the three quantities at the time of invasion. Note that R0=for most models, and >Rafter the invasion for all models. 2.3. TheClassicEpidemicModel. Using the notation in section 2.1, the classic epidemic model is the SIR model given by the initial value problem dS/dt=IS/N, S (0) =So0, dI/dt=IS/N I, andR(t)arethenumbersintheseclasses, sothat S(t)+I(t)+R(t)= N.

Here the replacement number at time zero is so, which is the product of the contact number and the initial susceptible fraction so. Theorem 2.1. Let(s(t),i(t))be a solution of (2.2)inT.I fso1, theni(t) decreases to zero as t.I fso>1, theni(t)rst increases up to a maximum valueimax=io+so1/[ln(so)]/and then decreases to zero as t.

(2.4) Typical paths in Tare shown in Figure 2, and solutions as a function of time are shown in Figure 3. Note that the hallmark of a typical epidemic outbreak is aninfectivecurvethatrstincreasesfromaninitial I onearzero,reachesapeak,andthen decreases toward zero as a function of time. For example, a recent measles epidemicin the Netherlands [52] is shown in Figure 4. The susceptible fraction s(t) always decreases, but the nal susceptible fraction s is positive. The epidemic dies out because, when the susceptible fraction s(t)g o e sb e l o w1 /, the replacement number s(t) goes below 1. The results in the theorem are epidemiologically reasonable, since the infectives decrease and there is no epidemic, if enough people are already immuneso that a typical infective initially replaces itself with no more than one new infective(s o1). But if a typical infective initially replaces itself with more than one new infective (so>1), then infectives initially increase so that an epidemic occurs. The speed at which an epidemic progresses depends on the characteristics of the disease.ThemeaslesepidemicinFigure4lastedforaboutninemonths, butbecausethelatentperiod for influenza is only one to three days and the infectious period is only twoto three days, an influenza epidemic can sweep through a city in less than six weeks.See [100] for more examples of epidemic outbreak curves. To prove the theorem, observe that the solution paths i(t)+s(t)[lns(t)]/=i o+so[lnso]/ in Figure 2 are found from the quotient dierential equation di/ds=1+1/(s). The equilibrium points along the saxis are neutrally unstable for s>1/and are neutrally stable for s<1/. For a complete (easy) proof, see [96] or [100]. One classic approximation derived in [18] is that for small ioandsoslightly greater than smax=1/, the dierence smaxs() is about equal to sosmax, so the nal susceptible fraction is about as far below the susceptible fraction smax(thesvalue where the infective fraction is a maximum) as the initial susceptible fraction wasabove it (see Figure 2). Observe that the threshold result here involves the initialreplacement number s oand does not involve the basic reproduction number R0. 2.4. The Classic Endemic Model. The classic endemic model is the SIR model with vital dynamics (births and deaths) given by dS/dt=\u00b5N\u00b5SIS/N, S (0) =So0, dI/dt=IS/N I\u00b5I, I (0) =Io0, dR/dt=I\u00b5R, R (0) =Ro0,(2.5) withS(t)+I(t)+R(t)=N. This SIR model is almost the same as the SIR epidemic model (2.1) above, except that it has an inflow of newborns into the susceptible class Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226.

The deaths balance the births, so that the population size Nis constant. The mean lifetime 1 /\u00b5would be about 75 years in the United States. Dividing the equations in (2.5) by the plane given by (2.3) is positively invariant, and the model is well posed [96]. Here the contact number remainsequaltothebasicreproductionnumber R0foralltime,becausenonewclasses of susceptibles or infectives occur after the invasion. For this model the thresholdquantity is given by R 0==/(+\u00b5), which is the contact rate times the average death-adjusted infectious period 1 /(+\u00b5). Theorem 2.2. Let(s(t),i(t))beasolutionof (2.6)inT.I f1orio=0,then solution paths disease-free equilibrium given by s=1and i=0.I f>1, then all solution paths with io>0approach the endemic equilibrium given byse=1/andie=\u00b5(1)/. Figures5and6illustratethetwopossibilitiesgiveninthetheorem. If R0=1, then the replacement number sis less than 1 when io>0, so that the infec- tives decrease to zero. Although the speeds of movement along the paths are notapparent from Figure 5, the infective fraction decreases rapidly to very near zero,and then over 100 or more years, the recovered people slowly die o and the birthprocess slowly increases the susceptibles, until eventually everyone is susceptible atthe disease-free equilibrium 1 so>1, thens(t) decreases and i(t) increases up to a peak and then decreases, just as it would for an epidemic (compare Figure 6 with Fig-ure 2). However, after the infective fraction has decreased to a low level, the slowprocesses of the deaths of recovered people and the births of new susceptibles grad-ually (over about 10 or 20 years) increase the susceptible fraction until s(t) is large enough that another smaller epidemic occurs. This process of alternating rapid epi-demics and slow regeneration of susceptibles continues as the paths approach the en-demic equilibrium given in the theorem. At this endemic equilibrium the replacementnumbers eis 1, which is plausible since if the replacement number were greater than or less than 1, the infective fraction i(t) would be increasing or decreasing, respectively. Theorem 2.2 was proved in [96] and in [100] using phase plane methods and Liapunov functions. For this SIR model there is a transcritical (stability exchange)bifurcation at = 1, as shown in Figure 7. Notice that the i ecoordinate of the endemic equilibrium is negative for <1, coincides with the disease-free equilibrium value of zero at = 1, and becomes positive for >1. This equilibrium given by se=1/andie=\u00b5(1)/is unstable for <1 and is locally asymptotically stable for>1, while the disease-free equilibrium given by s= 1 andi=0i s locally stable for <1 and unstable for >1.

SEIR model the global stability below the threshold was proved in [147] and the global stability above the threshold was recently proved using clever new methods[143]. Results for the MSEIR model are given in section 3. The following interpretation of the results in the theorem and paragraph above is one reason why the basic reproduction number R 0has become widely used in the epidemiologyliterature. Ifthebasicreproductionnumber R0(whichisalwaysequalto the contact number when the entire population is susceptible) is less than 1, then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable and the disease cannot\"invade\" the population. But if R 0>1, then the disease-free equilibrium is unstable with a repulsive direction into the positive siquadrant, so the disease can \"invade\" in the sense that any path starting with a small positive iomoves into the positive si quadrant where the disease persists. Thus for this classic SIR endemic model and formany other more complex models [58], the behavior is almost completely dependenton the threshold quantity R 0, which determines not only when the local stability of the disease-free equilibrium switches, but also when the endemic equilibrium entersthe feasible region with a positive infective fraction. The latter condition is used toobtain expressions for R 0in age-structured models in sections 5 and 6. Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226.

Threshold Estimates Usingthe Classic Models. The classic SIR models above are very important as conceptual models (similar to predator-prey and compet-ingspeciesmodelsinecology). TheSIRepidemicmodelingyieldstheusefulconceptofthe threshold quantity s o, which determines when an epidemic occurs, and formulas for the peak infective fraction imand the nal susceptible fraction s. The SIR endemic modeling yields R0=as the threshold quantity that determines when the disease remains endemic, the concept that the infective replacement number se is 1 at the endemic equilibrium, and the explicit dependence of the infective frac- tionieon the parameters. However, these simple, classic SIR models have obvious limitations. They unrealistically assume that the population is uniform and homoge-neously mixing, whereas it is known that mixing depends on many factors includingage (children usually have more adequate contacts per day than adults). Moreover,dierent geographic and social-economic groups have dierent contact rates. Despitetheir limitations, the classic SIR models can be used to obtain some estimates andcomparisons.

From (2.4) for sin the classic SIR epidemic model, the approximation ln(so/s) sos follows because iois negligibly small. By using data on the susceptible fractions so andsat the beginning and end of epidemics, this formula can be used to estimate contactnumbersforspecicdiseases[100]. UsingbloodsamplesfromfreshmenatYaleUniversity [75], the fractions susceptible to rubella at the beginning and end of thefreshman year were found to be 0.25 and 0.090, so the epidemic formula above gives6.4. The fractions s o=0.49 ands=0.425 for the Epstein-Barr virus (related to mononucleosis) lead to 2.2, and the fractions so=0.911 ands=0.514 for influenza (H3N2 type A \"Hong Kong\") lead to 1.44. For the 1957 \"Asian Flu\" (H2N2 type A strain of influenza) in Melbourne, Australia, the fractions so= 1 and s=0.55 from [31, p. 129] yield the contact number estimate 1.33. Thus the easy theory for the classic SIR epidemic model yields the formula above that can beused to estimate contact numbers from epidemic data. The classic SIR endemic model can also be used to estimate contact numbers. If blood samples in a serosurvey are tested for antibodies to a virus and it is assumedthat the SIR model above holds in the population with the disease at an endemicequilibrium, then the contact number can be estimated from =1/s e, whereseis the Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226.

This approach is somewhat naive, because the average seropositivity in a population decreases tozero as the initial passive immunity declines and then increases as people age and areexposedtoinfectives. Thustheagesofthosesampledarecriticalinusingtheestimate=1/s e. For the SIR model with negative exponential survival in section 5.4, one estimation formula for the basic reproduction number is R0=1+L/A, whereLis the average lifetime 1 /\u00b5andAis the average age of infection. This estimation formula can also be derived heuristically from the classic SIR endemic model. The incidencerate at the endemic equilibrium is i ese, so thatieis the incidence rate constant, which with exponential waiting time implies that the average age of infection (themean waiting time in S) is A=1/i e=1/[\u00b5(1)]. Using\u00b5=1/L, this leads to R0==1+L/A, sinceR0=for this model. Data on average ages of infection and average lifetimes in developed countries have been used to estimate basic reproduction numbers R0for some viral diseases. These estimates of R0are about 16 for measles, 11 for varicella (chickenpox), 12 for mumps, 7 for rubella, and poliomyelitis and smallpox [12, p. 70], [100]. Becausedisease-acquired immunity is only temporary for bacterial diseases such as pertussis(whooping cough) and diphtheria, the formula R 0==1+L/Acannot be used to estimateR0for these diseases (see section 8 for estimates of R0andfor pertussis). Herd immunity occurs for a disease if enough people have disease-acquired or vaccination-acquired immunity, so that the introduction of one infective into the pop-ulation does not cause an invasion of the disease. Intuitively, if the contact numberis, so that the typical infective has adequate contacts with people during the infectious period, then the replacement number smust be less than 1 so that the disease does not spread. This means that smust be less than 1 /, so the immune fractionrmust satisfy r>11/=11/R 0. For example, if R0== 10, then the immune fraction must satisfy r>11/1 0=0.9, so that the replacement number is less than 1 and the disease does not invade the population. Using the estimates above for R0, the minimum immune fractions for herd im- munity are 0.94 for measles, 0.89 for mumps, 0.86 for rubella, and 0.8 for poliomyeli-tis and smallpox. Although these values give only crude, ballpark estimates for thevaccination-acquired immunity level in a community required for herd immunity, theyare useful for comparing diseases. For example, these numbers suggest that it shouldbe easier to achieve herd immunity for poliomyelitis and smallpox than for measles,mumps, andrubella. Thisconclusionisjustiedbytheactualeectivenessofvaccina-tion programs in reducing, locally eliminating, and eradicating these diseases (eradi-cation means elimination throughout the world). The information in the next sectionveries that smallpox has been eradicated worldwide and polio should be eradicatedworldwide within a few years, while the diseases of rubella and measles still persist atlow levels in the United States and at higher levels in many other countries. Thus thenext section provides historical context and veries the disease comparisons obtainedfrom the simple, classic SIR endemic model. 2.6. Smallpox, Polio, Measles, Rubella, Chickenpox, and Influenza. Smallpox is believed to have appeared in the rst agricultural settlements around 6,000 BC.For centuries the process of variolation with material from smallpox pustules wasused in Africa, China, and India before arriving in Europe and the Americas in the18th century. Edward Jenner, an English country doctor, observed over 25 yearsthat milkmaids who had been infected with cowpox did not get smallpox. In 1796he started vaccinating people with cowpox to protect them against smallpox [168]. Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php THE MATHEMATICS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES 613 This was the world's rst vaccine ( vaccais the Latin word for cow). Two years later, the ndings of the rst vaccine trials were published, and by the early 1800s,the smallpox vaccine was widely available. Smallpox vaccination was used in manycountries in the 19th century, but smallpox remained endemic. When the WorldHealth Organization (WHO) started a global smallpox eradication program in 1967,there were about 15 million cases per year, of which 2 million died and millionsmore were disgured or blinded by the disease [77]. The WHO strategy involvedextensive vaccination programs (see Figure 8), surveillance for smallpox outbreaks,and containment of these outbreaks by local vaccination programs. There are someinteresting stories about the WHO campaign, including the persuasion of Africanchiefs to allow their tribes to be vaccinated and monetary bounty systems for ndinghidden smallpox cases in India. Smallpox was slowly eliminated from many countries,with the last case in the Americas in 1971. The last case worldwide was in Somaliain 1977, so smallpox has been eradicated throughout the world [23, 77, 168]. TheWHO estimates that the elimination of worldwide smallpox vaccination saves overtwo billion dollars per year. The smallpox virus has been kept in U.S. and Russiangovernment laboratories; the United States keeps it so that vaccine could be producedif smallpox were ever used in biological terrorism [182]. Most cases of poliomyelitis are asymptomatic, but a small fraction of cases result in paralysis. In the 1950s in the United States, there were about 60,000 paralyticpolio cases per year. In 1955 Jonas Salk developed an injectable polio vaccine froman inactivated polio virus. This vaccine provides protection for the person, but theperson can still harbor live viruses in their intestines and can pass them to others.In 1961 Albert Sabin developed an oral polio vaccine from weakened strains of thepolio virus. This vaccine provokes a powerful immune response, so the person cannotharborthe\"wild-type\"polioviruses, butaverysmallfraction(aboutonein2million)of those receiving the oral vaccine develop paralytic polio [23, 168]. The Salk vaccineinterrupted polio transmission and the Sabin vaccine eliminated polio epidemics inthe United States, so there have been no indigenous cases of naturally occurring poliosince 1979. In order to eliminate the few cases of vaccine-related paralytic polio eachyear, the United States now recommends the Salk injectable vaccine for the rst fourpolio vaccinations, even though it is more expensive [50]. In the Americas, the lastcase of paralytic polio caused by the wild virus was in Peru in 1991. In 1988 the WHOset a goal of global polio eradication by the year 2000 [178]. Most countries are usingthe live-attenuated Sabin vaccine, because it is inexpensive (8 cents per dose) and canbe easily administered into a mouth by an untrained volunteer. The WHO strategyincludesroutinevaccination, NationalImmunizationDays(duringwhichmanypeoplein a country or region are vaccinated in order to interrupt transmission), mopping-upvaccinations, and surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis [116]. Polio has disappearedfrom many countries in the past 10 years, so that by 1999 it was concentrated inthe Eastern Mediterranean region, South Asia, West Africa, and Central Africa. Itis likely that polio will soon be eradicated worldwide. The WHO estimates thateradicating polio will save about $1.5 billion each year in immunization, treatment,and rehabilitation around the globe [45]. Measlesisaseriousdiseaseofchildhoodthatcanleadtocomplicationsanddeath. For example, measles caused about 7,500 deaths in the United States in 1920 and stillcauses about 1 million deaths worldwide each year [47, 48]. Measles vaccinations aregiven to children between 6 and 18 months of age, but the optimal age of vaccinationfor measles seems to vary geographically [99].

The replacement number Rnow appears to be below 1throughout the United States, so that measles is no longer considered to be an indigenous disease there. Photo by Thomas S.England,PhotoResearchers,Inc. than 0.94 for measles and 0.86 for rubella. But the vaccine ecacy for these diseases is about 0.95, which means that 5% of those who are vaccinated do not becomeimmune. Thus to reach the levels necessary to achieve herd immunity, the vaccinatedfractions would have to be at least 0.99 for measles and 0.91 for rubella. Thesefractions suggest that achieving herd immunity would be much harder for measlesthan for rubella, because the percentages not vaccinated would have to be below1% for measles and below 9% for rubella. Because vaccinating all but 1% againstmeasles would be dicult to achieve, a two-dose program for measles is an attractivealternative in some countries [50, 98, 99]. Consider the history of measles in the United States. In the prevaccine era, every child had measles, so the incidences were approximately equal to the sizes of thebirth cohorts. After the measles vaccine was licensed in 1963 in the United States,the reported measles incidence dropped in a few years to around 50,000 cases peryear. See Figure 9. In 1978 the United States adopted a goal of eliminating measles,and vaccination coverage increased, so that there were fewer than 5,000 reportedcases per year between 1981 and 1988. Pediatric epidemiologists at meetings at theCenters for Disease Control in Atlanta in November 1985 and February 1988 decidedto continue the one-dose program for measles vaccinations instead of changing to amore expensive two-dose program. But there were about 16,000, 28,000, and 17,000reported measles cases in the United States in 1989, 1990, and 1991, respectively;there were also measles outbreaks in Mexico and Canada during these years [117].Because of this major measles epidemic, epidemiologists decided in 1989 that the one-dose vaccination program for measles, which had been used for 26 years, should be Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226.

HETHCOTE replaced with a two-dose program with the rst measles vaccination at age 12 to 15 months and the second vaccination at 4 to 6 years, just before children start school[50]. Reportedmeaslescasesdeclinedafter1991untiltherewereonly137, 100, and86reported cases in 1997, 1998, and 1999, respectively. Each year some of the reportedcases are imported cases and these imported cases can trigger small outbreaks. Theproportion of cases not associated with importation has declined from 85% in 1995,72% in 1996, 41% in 1997, to 29% in 1998. Analysis of the epidemiologic data for1998 suggests that measles is no longer an indigenous disease in the United States[47]. Measles vaccination coverage in 19 to 35-month-old children was only 92% in1998, but over 99% of children had at least one dose of measles-containing vaccineby age 6 years. Because measles is so easily transmitted and the worldwide measlesvaccination coverage was only 72% in 1998 [48, 168], this author does not believethat it is feasible to eradicate measles worldwide using the currently available measlesvaccines. Intheprevaccineera,rubellaepidemicsandsubsequentCRScasesoccurredabout every 4 to 7 years in the United States. During a major rubella epidemic in 1964, itis estimated that there were over 20,000 CRS cases in the United States with a totallifetime cost of over $2 billion [98, 101]. Since the rubella vaccine was licensed in 1969,the incidences of rubella and CRS in the United States have decreased substantially.Since many rubella cases are subclinical and unreported, we consider only the inci-dence of CRS. The yearly incidences of CRS in the United States were between 22and 67 in the 1970s, between 0 and 50 in the 1980s, 11 in 1990, 47 in 1991, 11 in 1992,and then between 4 and 8 from 1993 to 1999 [43]. Although there have been someincreases in CRS cases associated with occasional rubella outbreaks, CRS has been ata relatively low level in the United States in recent years. In recent rubella outbreaksin the United States, most cases occurred among unvaccinated persons aged at least20 years and among persons who were foreign born, primarily Hispanics (63% of re-ported cases in 1997) [46]. Although it does not solve the problem of unvaccinatedimmigrants, the rubella vaccination program for children has reduced the incidenceof rubella and CRS in the United States to very low levels. Worldwide eradicationof rubella is not feasible, because over two-thirds of the population in the world isnot yet routinely vaccinated for rubella. Indeed, the policies in China and India ofnot vaccinating against rubella may be the best policies for those countries, becausemost women of childbearing age in these countries already have disease-acquired im-munity. The varicella zoster virus (VZV) varicella, commonly known as chickenpox. Chickenpox is usually a mild disease in children that lasts about four tosevendayswithabodyrashofseveralhundredlesions. Afteracaseofchickenpox, theVZV becomes latent in the dorsal VZV can reactivate in the form ofzoster, commonly known as shingles. Shingles is a painful vesicular rash along one ormore sensory root nerves that usually occurs when the immune system is less eectivedue to illness or aging [23]. People with shingles are less infectious than those withchickenpox, but they can transmit the VZV. Indeed, it was found that some isolatedAmazontribeshadnoantibodiestodiseasessuchasmeasles, mumps, andrubella, butthey did have antibodies to VZV [25]. Thus it appears that the persistence of VZV inthese small isolated populations has occurred because VZV can be dormant in peoplefor many years and then be spread in the population by a case of shingles. Because ofthe transmission by those with both chickenpox and shingles, the expression for R 0is more complicated than for the MSEIR model [180]. A varicella vaccine was licensed Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php THE MATHEMATICS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES 617 in the United States in 1995 and is now recommended for all young children. But the vaccine-immunity wanes, so that vaccinated children can get chickenpox as adults.Two possible dangers of this new varicella vaccination program are more chickenpoxcases in adults, when the complication rates are higher, and an increase in cases ofshingles. An age-structured epidemiologic-demographic model has been used withparameters estimated from epidemiological data to evaluate the eects of varicellavaccination programs [179]. Although the age distribution of varicella cases does shiftin the computer simulations, this shift does not seem to be a problem since many ofthe adult cases occur after vaccine-induced immunity wanes, so they are mild varicellacases with fewer complications. In the computer simulations, shingles incidence in-creases in the rst 30 years after initiation of a varicella vaccination program, becausepeople are more likely to get shingles as adults when their immunity is not boostedby frequent exposures, but after 30 years the shingles incidence starts to decrease asthe population includes more previously vaccinated people, who are less likely to getshingles. Thus the simulations validate the second danger that the new vaccinationprogram could lead to more cases of shingles in the rst several decades [179]. Type A influenza has three subtypes in humans (H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2) that are associated with widespread epidemics and pandemics (i.e., worldwide epidemics).Types B and C influenza tend to be associated with local or regional epidemics.Influenza subtypes are classied by antigenic properties of the H and N surface gly-coproteins, whose mutations lead to new variants every few years [23]. For example,the A/Sydney/5/97(H3N2) variant entered the United States in 1998-1999 and wasthe dominant variant in the 1999-2000 flu season [51]. An infection or vaccination forone variant may give only partial immunity to another variant of the same subtype,so that flu vaccines must be reformulated almost every year. If an influenza virus sub-type did not change, then it should be easy to eradicate, because the contact numberfor flu has been estimated above to be only about 1.4. But the frequent drift of theA subtypes to new variants implies that flu vaccination programs cannot eradicatethem because the target is constantly moving. Completely new A subtypes (antigenicshift) emerge occasionally from unpredictable recombinations of human with swine oravian influenza antigens. These new subtypes can lead to major pandemics. A newH1N1 subtype led to the 1918-1919 pandemic that killed over half a million people inthe United States and over 20 million people worldwide. Pandemics also occurred in1957 from the Asian Flu (an H2N2 subtype) and in 1968 from the Hong Kong flu (anH3N2 subtype) [134]. When 18 conrmed human cases with 6 deaths from an H5N1chicken flu occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, there was great concern that this mightlead to another antigenic shift and pandemic. At the end of 1997, veterinary author-ities slaughtered all (1.6 million) chickens present in Hong Kong, and importation ofchickens from neighboring areas was stopped. Fortunately, the H5N1 virus did notevolve into a form that is readily transmitted from person to person [185, 198]. 3. The MSEIR Model with Exponentially Changing Size. The two classic in- fectious disease models in section 2 assume that the total population size remainsconstant. However, constant population size models are not suitable when the nat-ural births and deaths are not balanced or when the disease-related deaths are sig-nicant. Infectious diseases have often had a big impact on population sizes andhistorical events [158, 168, 202]. Infectious diseases that have played a major role inthe debilitation and regulation of human populations include plague, measles, scar-let fever, diphtheria, tuberculosis, smallpox, malaria, schistosomiasis, the gastroenteritises, and the Downloaded to 137.110.36.226.

Diseasessuchassmallpox, diphtheria, andmeaslesbroughtbyEuropeansdevastatednativepopula-tions in the Americas. AIDS is now changing the population structure in sub-SaharanAfrica. Infectious diseases such as measles combined with low nutritional status stillcause signicant early mortality in developing countries. Indeed, the longer life spansin developed countries seem to be primarily a result of the decline of mortality dueto communicable diseases [44]. Models with a variable total population size are often more dicult to analyze mathematicallybecausethepopulationsizeisanadditionalvariablewhichisgovernedby a dierential equation [7, 8, 29, 30, 35, 37, 83, 88, 153, 159, 171, 201]. Some modelsofHIV/AIDSwithvaryingpopulationsizehavebeenconsidered[13,39,118,132,146].Before looking at MSEIR models with age structures, we rst consider an MSEIRmodel in a population with an exponentially changing size. 3.1. Formulation of the Differential Equations for the MSEIR Model. The MSEIR model shown in Figure 10 is suitable for a directly transmitted disease such asmeasles, rubella, or mumps, for which an infection confers permanent immunity. Letthe birth rate constant be band the death rate constant be d, so the population size N(t) satisesN /prime=(bd)N. Thus the population is growing, constant, or decaying if the net change rate q=bdis positive, zero, or negative, respectively. Since the population size can have exponential growth or decay, it is appropriate to separatethe dynamics of the epidemiological process from the dynamics of the population size.The numbers of people in the epidemiological classes are denoted by M(t),S(t),E(t), I(t), andR(t), wheretis time, and the fractions of the population in these classes are m(t),s(t),e(t),i(t), andr(t). We are interested in nding conditions that determine whether the disease dies out (i.e., the fraction igoes to zero) or remains endemic (i.e., the fraction iremains positive). Note that the number of infectives Icould go to innity even though the fraction igoes to zero if the population size Ngrows faster thanI. Similarly, Icould go to zero even when iremains bounded awayfrom zero, if the population size is decaying to zero [83, 159]. To avoid any ambiguities, we focuson the behavior of the fractions in the epidemiological classes. The birth rate bSinto the susceptible class of size Scorresponds to newborns whose mothers are susceptible, and the other newborns b(NS) enter the passively immune class of size M, since their mothers were infected or had some type of immu- nity. Althoughallwomenwouldbeoutofthepassivelyimmuneclasslongbeforetheirchildbearing years, theoretically a passively immune mother would transfer some IgGantibodies to her newborn child, so the infant would have passive immunity. Deathsoccur in the epidemiological classes at the rates dM,dS,dE,dI, anddR, respectively. In this MSEIR epidemiological model, the transfer out of the passively immune class isM, the transfer out of the exposed class is E, and the recovery rate from the infectious class is I. The linear transfer terms in the dierential equations correspond to waiting times with negative exponential distributions, so that whenbirths and deaths are ignored, the mean passively immune period is 1 /, the mean latent period is 1 /, and the mean infectious period is 1 /[109]. These periods are 1/= 6 months, 1 /= 14 days, and 1 /= 7 days for chickenpox [179]. For sexually transmitted diseases, it is useful to dene both a sexual contact rate and the fractionof contacts that result in transmission, but for directly transmitted diseases spreadprimarily by aerosol droplets, transmission may occur by entering a room, hallway,building, etc., that is currently or has been occupied by an infective.

An adequate contact is a contact that is sucient fortransmission of infection from an infective to a susceptible. Let the contact rate be the average number of adequate contacts per person per unit time, so that the forceof infection =iis the average number of contacts with infectives per unit time. Then the incidence (the number of new cases per unit time) is S=iS=SI/N, since it is the number of contacts with infectives per unit time of the Ssusceptibles. As described in section 2.1, this standard form SI/Nfor the incidence is consistent with numerous studies that show that the contact rate is nearly independent of the population size. Thesystemofdierentialequationsforthenumbersintheepidemiologicalclasses and the population size is dM/dt=b(NS)(+d)M, dS/dt=bS+MSI/N dS, dE/dt=SI/N (+d)E, dI/dt=E(+d)I, to convert dierential equations for the fractions in the epidemio- logicalclasseswithsimplicationsbyusingthedierentialequationfor N, eliminating the dierential equation for sby usings=1meir, usingb=d+q, and using the force of infection fori.

The domain Dis positively invariant, because no solution paths leave through any boundary. The right sides of (3.1) are smooth, so that initial value problems haveunique solutions that exist on maximal intervals [92]. Since paths cannot leave D, solutions exist for all positive time. Thus the model is mathematically and epidemi-ologically well posed. Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226.

The basic reproduction number R0for this MSEIR model is the same as the contact number given by R0== (+d+q)(+d+q). (3.2) ThisR0is the product of the contact rate per unit time, the average infectious period adjusted for population growth of 1 /(+d+q), and the fraction /(+d+q) of exposed people surviving the latent class E.T h u sR0has the correct interpretation that it is the average number of secondary infections due to an infective during theinfectious period, when everyone in the population is susceptible.

At the endemic equilibrium the force of infection =iesatises the equation =(d+q)(R01)/(+d+q), (3.4) so that there is a positive force of infection whenR0>1. By linearization, the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if R0<1 and is an unstable hyperbolic equilibrium with a stable manifold outside D and an unstable manifold tangent to a vector into DwhenR0>1. The disease-free equilibrium can be shown to be globally asymptotically stable in DifR01 by using the Liapunov function V=e+(+d+q)i, as follows. The Liapunov derivative isV=[s(+d+q)(+d+q)]i0, since(+d+q)(+d+q). The set where V= 0 is the face of Dwithi= 0, butdi/dt=eon this face, so that I moves o the face unless e= 0.

Thus if R01, then the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable in D. The characteristic equation corresponding to the Jacobian at the endemic equi- librium is a fourth-degree polynomial.

Based on results for the SIR and SEIR models, we expect (but have not proved rigorously) that all paths in Dwith some initial latents or infectives go to the endemic equilibrium if R0>1. Then we have the usual behavior for an endemic model, in the sense that the disease dies outbelow the threshold, and the disease goes to a unique endemic equilibrium above thethreshold. Other similar models also have the endemic threshold property above. The MSEIRS model is similar to the MSEIR model, but the immunity after an infec-tion is temporary. This MSEIRS model has a dierent endemic equilibrium, but ithas the same basic reproduction number R 0given by (3.2). If , then heuristi- cally the M class disappears (think of people moving through the M class with innitespeed), so that the MSEIR and MSEIRS models become SEIR and SEIRS models[147] with the same basic reproduction number R 0given by (3.2). If , then the E class disappears, leading to MSIR and MSIRS models with R0=/(+d+q). If an SEIRS model has an Rtransfer term from the removed class R to the susceptible class S and , then the R class disappears, leading to an SEIS model with R0 given by (3.2). If , then the E class disappears and the SEIS model becomes an SIS model with R0=/(+d+q). Ifand, then both the M and E classes disappear in the MSEIR model leading to an SIR or SIRS model withR 0=/(+d+q). The global stabilities of the endemic equilibria have been proved for the constant population size SEIR model [143], for the SEIRS model with short orlong period of immunity [145], and for the SEIR model with exponentially changingpopulation size under a mild restriction [144]. The global stabilities of the SIR, SIRS,and SEIS models with constant population sizes are proved by standard phase planemethods[96,100]. TheSISmodelwithconstantpopulationsizereducestoaBernoullidierential equation, so solutions can be found explicitly [96, 100]. SIRS and SEIRmodels with exponential population dynamics have also been studied [144, 159]. 4. Two Demographic Models. Before formulating the age-structured epidemi- ological models, we present the underlying demographic models, which describe thechanging size and age structure of a population over time. These demographic mod-els are a standard partial dierential equations model with continuous age and ananalogous ordinary dierential equations model with age groups. 4.1. The Demographic Model with Continuous Age. The demographic model consists of an initial-boundary value problem with a partial dierential equation froma1toa2.The the population growth is U a+U t=d(a)U, (4.1) whered(a) is the age-specic death rate. Note that the partial derivative combination occurs because the derivative of U(a(t),t) with respect to tisU ada dt+U t, andda dt=1 .

HETHCOTE inconjunctionwithepidemicmodels,andbyvonFoerster[195]forcellproliferation,so it is sometimes called the Lotka-McKendrick model or the McKendrick-von Foerstermodel. We briefly sketch the proof ideas for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of U(a,t) whend(a) andf(a) are reasonably smooth [114, 123].

This equation with a kernel K(a) in the rst integral and g(t) for the second integral becomes the renewal equation B(t)=/integraltextt 0K(a)B(ta)da+g(t). To analyze this con- volution integral equation for B(t), take Laplace transforms and evaluate the contour integral form of the inverse Laplace transform by a residue series. As t, the residue for the extreme right pole dominates, which leads to U(a,t)eqtA(a)a s t. Thus the population age distribution approaches the steady state A(a), and the population size approaches exponential growth or decay of the form eqt. To learn more about the asymptotic age distribution A(a), assume a separa- tion of variables form given by U(a,t)=T(t)A(a). Substituting this into the par- tial dierential equation (4.1) solving the equation (4.2), we obtain the Lotka characteristic equa- tion given by 1=/integraldisplay 0f(a)exp[D(a)qa]da. (4.3) If the population reproduction number given by Rpop=/integraldisplay 0f(a)exp[D(a)]da (4.4) is less than, equal to, or greater than 1, then the qsolution of (4.3) is negative, zero, or positive, respectively, so that the population is decaying, constant, or growing,respectively. In order to simplify the demographic aspects of the epidemiological models so there is no dependence on the initial population age distribution, we assume that theagedistributionintheepidemiologymodelshasreachedasteadystateagedistributionwith the total population size at time 0 normalized to 1, so that U(a,t)=e qteD(a)qawith=1/slashbigg/integraldisplay 0eD(a)qada. (4.5) In this case the birth equation (4.2) is equivalent to the characteristic equation (4.3). If the age-specic death rate d(a) is constant, then (4.5) is U(a,t)=eqt(d+ q)e(d+q)a. Intuitively, when q>0, the age distribution is ( d+q)e(d+q)a, because the increasing inflow of newborns gives a constantly increasing young population, sothattheagedistributiondecreaseswithagefasterthan de da, correspondingto q=0 .

In this case, d(a) is zero until age Land innite after age L, so thatD(a) is zero until age Land is innite after age L. These two approximate survival functions given by the step function and the negative exponential were calledType I and Type II mortality, respectively, by Anderson and May [12]. Of course,the best approximation for any country is found by using death rate information forthat country to estimate d(a). This approach is used in the models with age groups in sections 7 and 8. Thefactorw(a)=e D(a)givesthefractionofabirthcohortsurvivinguntilage a, so it is called the survival function. The rate of death is w/prime(a), so that the expected ageaof dying isE[a]=/integraltext 0a[w/prime(a)]da=/integraltext 0wda. When the death rate coecient d(a) is constant, then w(a)=edaand the mean lifetime Lis 1/d. For a step survival function, the mean lifetime is the xed lifetime L. 4.2. TheDemographicModelwithAgeGroups. This demographic model with agegroupshasbeendevelopedfromtheinitialboundaryvalueproblemintheprevioussection for use in age-structured epidemiologic models for pertussis [105]. It consistsofasystemof nordinarydierentialequationsforthesizesofthe nagegroupsdened by the age intervals [ a i1,ai], where 0 = a0<a1<a2<\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7<an1<an=.A maximum age is not assumed, so the last age interval [ an1,) corresponds to all people over age an1.Fora[ai1,ai],assume that the death rates and fertilities are constant with d(a)=diandf(a)=fi. We also assume that the population has reached an equilibrium age distribution with exponential growth in the formU(a,t)=e qtA(a) given by (4.5), so that the number of individuals in the age bracket [ai1,ai] is given by Ni(t)=/integraldisplayai ai1U(a,t)da=eqt/integraldisplayai ai1A(a)da=eqtPi, (4.6) wherePiis the size of the ith age group at time 0. Substituting U(a,t)=eqtA(a) into (4.1) yields the ordinary dierential equation dA/da=[d(a)+q]A, which can be solved on the interval [ ai1,ai] to obtain A(a)=A(ai1)exp[(di+q)(aai1)]. (4.7) Integrate this A(a) over the interval [ ai1,ai]t og e t Pi=A(ai1){1exp[(di+q)(aiai1)]}/(di+q). (4.8) Fori=1,2,...,n 1,it is convenient to dene the constants cibyA(ai)=ciPi.

Substituting A(ai)=ciPileads toPi=ci1Pi1/(ci+di+q) fori2.Iterative use of this equation leads to the following equation for Piin terms ofP1: Pi=ci1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7c1P1 (4.11) lead to the age-group form of the Lotka characteristic equation (4.3) given by 1=f1+f2c1 (c2+d2+q)+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+fncn1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7c1 (cn+dn+q)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7(c2+d2+q) (c1+d1+q). (4.12) For this demographic model with nage groups, the population reproduction number is given by Rpop=f11 (c1+d1)+f2c1 (c2+d2)(c1+d1)+\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7+fncn1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7c1 (cn+dn+q)\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7(c1+d1).(4.13) If the fertility constants fiand the death rate constants difor the age groups are known, then (4.12) with each cigiven by (4.9) can be solved for the exponential growth rate constant q. If the population reproduction number Rpopis less than, equal to, or greater than 1, then the qsolution of (4.12) is negative, zero, or positive, respectively, so that the population is decaying, constant, or growing, respectively.As in the continuous demographic model, it is assumed that the population starts ata steady state age distribution with total size 1 at time 0, so that the group sizes P i remain xed and add up to 1. See [105] for more details on the derivation of this demographic model for age groups. 5. TheMSEIRModelwithContinuousAgeStructure. Formanyendemicmod- els the basic reproduction number can be determined analytically by either of twomethods. One method is to nd the threshold condition above which a positive (en-demic) equilibrium exists for the model and to interpret this threshold condition asR 0>1. The second method is to do a local stability analysis of the disease-free equi- librium and to interpret the threshold condition at which this equilibrium switchesfrom asymptotic stability to instability as R 0>1. As shown in section 2.4, both of these methods give the same R0for the classic SIR endemic model, because the two equilibria exchange stability with each other in the sense that as the contact rateincreases, the unstable, nontrivial equilibrium with a negative coordinate moves fromoutside the feasible region through the disease-free equilibrium at R 0= 1 and into the feasibleregion,whereitbecomesapositive,stableendemicequilibrium. Similarmeth-ods work to obtain the basic reproduction number for age-structured epidemiologicalmodels; both are demonstrated for an SIR model with continuous age dependencein [40]. Here we use the appearance of an endemic steady state age distribution toidentify expressions for the basic reproduction number R 0, and then show that the disease-free steady state is globally asymptotically stable if and only if R01.

Because informa- tion on age-related fertilities and death rates is available for most countries andbecause mixing is generally heterogeneous, epidemiology models with age groupsare now used frequently when analyzing specic diseases. However, special caseswith homogeneous mixing and asymptotic age distributions that are a negative ex-ponential or a step function are considered in sections 5.4 and 5.6. These specialcases of the continuous MSEIR model are often used as approximate models. Forexample, the negative exponential age distribution is used for measles in Niger insection 7. 5.1. Formulation of the MSEIR Model. The rate constants ,, andfor the transfer rates out of the M, E, and I classes are the same as for the MSEIR modelwithout age structure in section 2. Here it is assumed that the contact rate be-tween people of age aand age ais separable in the form b(a)b(a), so that the force of infection is the integral over all ages of the contact rate times the infectious fractionI(a,t)//integraltext 0U(a,t)daat timet. The division by the total population size/integraltext 0U(a,t)damakes the contact rate (a,t) independent of the population size, so the contact number is independent of the population size [57, 97, 102, 159]. Oneexample of separable mixing is proportionate mixing, in which the contacts of aperson of age aare distributed over those of other ages in proportion to the ac- tivity levels of the other ages [103, 174]. If l(a) is the average number of people contacted by a person of age aper unit time, u(a) is the steady state age distribu- tion for the population, and D=/integraltext 0l(a)u(a)dais the total number of contacts per unit time of all people, then b(a)=l(a)/D1/2andb(a)=l(a)/D1/2. An- other example of separable mixing is age-independent mixing given by b(a)=1a n d b(a)=. Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226.

This expression (5.9) for the basic reproduction number in the MSEIR model seems to be new. Determining the local stability of the disease-free steady state (at which = kb(a)=0a n ds= 1) by linearization is possible following the method in [40], but we can construct a Liapunov function to show the global stability of the disease-freesteady state when R 01. The feasible set for (5.2) consists of nonnegative fractions that add to 1. Consider the Liapunov function V=/integraldisplay 0[(a)e(a,t)+(a)i(a,t)]da, where the positive, bounded functions (a) and(a) are to be determined.

Hence solutions of (5.2) move downward through the level sets of Vas long as they do not stall on the set where V= 0. The set with V= 0 is the boundary of the feasible region with i= 0, butdi(a(t),t)/dt=eon this boundary, so that imoves o this boundary unless e=0 . I fe=i= 0 so there are no exposed or infectious people, then (5.1) implies that there would be no removed people or infants withpassive immunity after several generations, so everyone would be susceptible. Thusthe disease-free steady state is the only positively invariant subset of the set with V= 0. If there is a nite maximum age (so that all forward paths have compact closure), then either Corollary 2.3 in [162] or Corollary 18.5 in [4] (Liapunov-Lasalletheorems for semiflows) implies that all paths in the feasible region approach thedisease-free steady state. IfR 0>1, then we have V>0 for points suciently close to the disease-free steady state with sclose to 1 and i>0 for some age, so that the disease-free steady state is unstable.

For example, the endemic steady state can be unstable in the age-structured SIR model when b(a) is decreasing and b(a) is constant [16] and when b(a) is concentrated at a certain age while b(a) is constant [189]. Some types of mixing cannot be written in the separable form b(a)b(a). For example, in preferred mixing, certain age groups are more likely to mix with their own age group [103]. For moregeneral mixing, the endemic steady state might not be unique, but some conditionsthat guarantee existence, uniqueness, and local stability have been given [53, 125]. Because the basic reproduction number for the MSEIR model does not depend onor on whether recovered people have no, temporary, or permanent immunity, the expression (5.9) for R 0also works for the MSEIRS, SEIR, SEIRS, and SEIS models, but the equations (5.8) for kwould be dierent. For example, in the SEIR model all newborns are susceptible, so s0= 1 and the equation for kis (5.8) with F=1 .F o r the SIR model with no passively immune or latent classes, an analysis similar to thatabove for the MSEIR model leads to an equation for the force of infection constant k given by 1=/integraldisplay 0b(a)eD(a)qaa/integraldisplaya 0b(y)eyk/integraltexty 0b()ddyda (5.10) by R0=/integraldisplay 0b(a)eD(a)qaa/integraldisplaya 0b(y)eydyda. (5.11) This expression is similar to previous R0expressions for SIR models with constant population size [40, 68]. The expression (5.11) for R0can also be used for SIRS and SIS models, but the equations for the positive kwhenR0>1 would be dierent. Proofs of stability and persistence for the models in this paragraph are similar tothose for the MSEIR model. 5.3.

Although the steady state age distribution of the population ise D(a)qa, the age distribution for a specic birth cohort is eD(a)//integraltext 0eD(a)da. Thus the rate at which individuals in a birth cohort leave the susceptible class due toan infection is (a)s(a)e D(a)//integraltext 0eD(a)da, wheres(a) is given in (5.4). Hence the expected age Afor leaving the susceptible class is A=E[a]=/integraltext 0a(a)eD(a)[Fe(a)+(1F)/integraltexta 0ex(a)+( x)dx]da/integraltext 0(a)eD(a)[Fe(a)+(1F)/integraltexta 0ex(a)+( x)dx]da. (5.12) This expression assumes that the force of infection (a)=kb(a) at the endemic steady state age distribution has already been determined, so that ( a),F, andF are known.

Expressionsfor R0andAwithNegativeExponentialSurvival. When the death rate coecient d(a) is independent of the age a, the age distribution (4.5) be- comesU(a,t)=eqt(d+q)e(d+q)a. Also, the waiting times in M, E, and I have negative exponential distributions, so that, after adjusting for changes in the popu-lation size, the average period of passive immunity, the average latent period, andthe average infectious period are 1 /(+d+q), 1/(+d+q), and 1/(+d+q), respectively. Here it is also assumed that the contact rate is independent of the agesof the infectives and susceptibles, so we let b(a)=1a n d b(a)=. In this case (5.9) dening the basic reproduction number becomes R 0=/[(+d+q)(+d+q)], (5.14) which has the same interpretation as R0in the MSEIR model without age structure.

Thus the infective replacement numberR0\u00afsis 1 at the endemic equilibrium for this model. However, this is generally not true, so it is not valid to use R0=1/\u00afsto derive an expression for the basic reproduction number.

One can solve (5.16) for s0to obtain s0=(FF)/[(1F)(1F)]. (5.17) The right side of (5.17) is a decreasing function of withF= 1 ands0=1a t=0 . Substituting (5.17) into (5.15) yields (5.8) given by 1=R0(d+q)/bracketleftbigg FF+()(1F) +d+q/bracketrightbigg (+d+q)[(1F)(1F)], (5.18) which relates R0and. Because the right side of (5.18) is a decreasing function of that goes from R0at= 0 to zero as , (5.18) has a positive solution if and only if R0>1. Ifd(a)=dandf(a)=b=d+q, then (5.18) reduces to (3.4) forin the ordinary dierential equation MSEIR model. When R01, solutions of (5.2) approach the disease-free steady state (5.4) with = 0, and for xed R0>1, we expect solutions to approach the endemic steady state (5.4) with the constant determined by solving either (5.18) or the combination of (5.15) and (5.16). We now nd an expression for the average age of infection for this MSEIR model.

Thus the rate that individuals in a birth cohort leave the susceptible class due to an infection is s(a)deda, wheres(a) is given in (5.4). Here the equation for the expected age Afor leaving the susceptible is useful to consider limiting cases of the model and the corresponding limiting equations for R0andA.I f, the M class disappears, so that the MSEIR model becomes an SEIR model with s0= 1, and the equations above reduce to =(d+q)(R01) andA=1/(+d), whereR0is still given by (5.14). These same equations also hold for the SIR model, but R0=/(+d+q) for this model. For the SEIR and SIR models it is possible to solve explicitly for R0in terms of the average lifetimeL=1/dandtheaverageageofinfection AtoobtainR0=(q+1/A)/(q+1/L). When the population has constant size with q= 0, theR0expression reduces to R0=L/A, which is the usual formula for the SEIR and SIR models [105]. By not including the death factor edawhen considering the rate of leaving the susceptible class, one obtains the widely cited approximate formula R0=1+L/Afor the SEIR and SIR models [61]. But the death factor really should be included, since we wantto calculate the average age for those who survive long enough to become infected. As another limiting case, consider the MSEIR model for a very virulent disease in which almost every mother has been infected. In the limiting situation everynewborn infant has passive immunity, so that m 01 ands00. In this case =(d+q)[R0/(+d+q)1] andA=1/(+d)+1/(+d). Note that the formula foris for an endemic steady state for a virulent disease, so it does not imply thatR0/(+d+q)>1 is the threshold condition for existence of a positive endemic steady state age distribution; compare with [12, p. 81]. The formula for Ais plausible since it is the sum of the average period p=1/(+d) of passive immunity and the average age of attack 1 /(+d) from the SEIR model. Thus for a very virulent disease, adding a passively immune class to a model increases the average age of attack by themean period of passive immunity. Solving for R 0in terms of the average period pof passive immunity and the average lifetime L=1/d, we obtain R0=[q+1/(Ap)](1+pq) (q+1/L)(1p/L). (5.20) For a constant population size with q= 0, we have R0=L/[(Ap)(1p/L)]. For q= 0 andp/lessmuchL, we obtain the approximation R0(L+p)/(Ap). For this MSEIR model with constant size, it seems that one could just subtract o the average periodpof passive immunity from the average age Aof infection and the average lifetime L to obtain the approximation R 0(Lp)/(Ap) used in [12, p. but ourcarefulanalysishereshowsthatthisnaiveformuladoesnotwork. Ofcourse, whenq= 0 andp= 0, the expression (5.20) reduces to the previous expression R 0=L/A for the SEIR model with constant population size. 5.5.

HETHCOTE compared with the corresponding results for the MSEIR model with age groups in section 7. Let gbe the fraction of the population vaccinated successfully at age Av (i.e., the fraction of the population which has permanent immunity after vaccination). In epidemiological terminology, gis the product of the fraction vaccinated and the vaccine ecacy. This vaccination at age Avcauses a jump discontinuity in the sus- ceptible age distribution given by s(Av+0 )=( 1 g)s(Av0), wheres(Av0) is the limit from the left and s(Av+0) is the limit from the right. With this jump condition, the ordinary dierential equations corresponding to (5.2) without time derivatives, but with constant dand, are solved rst on the interval [0,Av] and then on the interval [ Av,).

Given g,Av, and the values for the parameters ,,,,d, andq, the equations (5.21) and (5.22) are two simultaneous equations in the unknowns R0,s0, and.I ti s possible to solve (5.22) for s0and then substitute into (5.21), but we do not present the resulting, rather complicated expression, which relates R0and. For SEIR and SIR models, s0= 1, fraction gmust be in order to achieve herd immunity. Recall that a population has herd immunity if a large enough fraction is immune, so that thedisease would not spread if an outside infective were introduced into the population.To determine this threshold we consider the situation when the disease is at a verylow level with nearly zero, so that almost no one is infected. Thus the initial passively immune fraction m 0is very small and the initial susceptible fraction s0 is nearly 1. In the limit as s01, (5.21) for the MSEIR model reduces to = (d+q)(R0[1ge(+d+q)Av]1), which has a positive solution if and only if ge(d+q)Av<11/R0. If the successfully vaccinated fraction gat ageAvis large enough so that ge(d+q)Av11/R0, (5.24) then the population has herd immunity and the disease cannot spread in this popu- lation. It may seem surprising that this condition is the same for the SEIR and theMSEIR models, but for very low disease levels, almost no newborn children have pas-sive immunity, so that the passively immune class M has no influence on the thresholdcondition. A similar criterion for herd immunity with vaccination at two ages in aconstant population is given in [98]. Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226.

Intuitively, there are so many immunesthat the average infective cannot replace itself with at least one new infective duringthe infectious period and, consequently, the disease dies out. If the inequality aboveis not satised and there are some infecteds initially, then we expect the susceptiblefraction to approach the stable age distribution given by the jump solution with apositive, constant that satises (5.21) and (5.22). For an MSEIR model an expression for the average age of infection is A=1 +dgAv[c1e(+d)Av+c2e(+d)Av]+c2 (+d)2 c1[1ge(+d)Av]+c2[+d +dge(+d)Av]. The analogous expression for an SEIR or SIR model has c2= 0.

Typically the lifetime Lis larger than the average age of attack A1/, and both are much larger than the average latent period 1 /and the average infectious period 1/.

(6.9) 7. ApplicationtoMeaslesinNiger. A deterministic compartmental mathemati- cal model has been developed for the study of the eects of heterogeneous mixing andvaccination distribution on disease transmission in Africa [133]. This study focuses onvaccination against measles in the city of Naimey, Niger, in sub-Saharan Africa. Therapidly growing population consists of a majority group with low transmission ratesand a minority group of seasonal urban migrants with higher transmission rates. De-mographic and measles epidemiological parameters are estimated from data on Niger. Here we consider the MSEIR model with 16 age groups for a homogeneously mixing, unvaccinatedpopulationinNiger[133]. Thefertilityratesandthedeathratesin the 16 age groups are obtained from Niger census data. Using the Lotka equation(4.12) for the demographic model with age groups, the value of qcorresponds to a growth of 3.36% per year. This is consistent with the estimate from 1988 census dataof 3.3% growth per year. From measles data, it is estimated that the average periodof passive immunity 1 /is 6 months, the average latent period 1 /is 14 days and the average infectious period 1 /is 7 days. From data on a 1995 measles outbreak in Niamey, theforceofinfection isestimatedtobetheconstant0.762peryear[133]. A computer calculation using the demographic and epidemiological parameter values inthe formula (6.6) for the basic reproduction number yields R 0=1 8.83. The average age of infection at the endemic equilibrium found from (6.9) is A=2.4 years. We now consider two methods for nding approximations to R,R0, andA. The rst method nds approximate values during the computer simulations of the MSEIRmeasles model. Recall from section 1 that the replacement number Ris the actual numberofnewcasesperinfectiveduringtheinfectiousperiod. Rcanbeapproximated by computing the sum over all age groups of the daily incidence times the averageinfectious period times the fraction surviving the latent period, and then dividing bythe total number of infectives in all age j=1jsjPj/parenleftbigg1 +dj+q/parenrightbigg/parenleftbigg +dj+q/parenrightbigg /summationtext16 approximation is computed to be R=0.99988, which is consistent with the concept that the average replacement number is equal to 1 at the endemic equilibrium. For this MSEIR model there is only one class of infectives, so that the basic reproduction number R0is equal to the contact number at the prevaccination endemic equilibrium. This contact number is approximated by computing the product of the sum of the daily incidences when all contacts are assumed to be withsusceptibles times the average infectious period, and dividing by the total number ofinfectives. When all of the s jin the numerator in the expression for the replacement numberRare replaced by 1, then we obtain the expression for the contact number Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226.

At the prevaccination endemic equilibrium, this yields R0=18.85, which is very close to the formula value of 18.83. The average age of infection can be approximated inthe measles computer simulations by the quotient of the sum of the average age ineach age group times the incidence in that age group and the sum of the incidences.Hence A=/summationtext 16 j=1[aj1+aj 2]jsjPj/summationtext16 j=1jsjPj. This approach gives A=2.2 years, which is slightly less than the formula value of 2.4 years. The second approximation method is to use the formulas for the MSEIR model in sections 4.4 and 4.5, which has uniform constant mortality and a negative exponentialage distribution. This model is plausible because the age distribution of the Nigerpopulation is closely approximated by a negative exponential [133]. From censusdata the death rate for the population is 22 per thousand per year. Using this d value and the fertilities in the Lotka characteristic equation for discrete age groups(4.12), we solve iteratively to obtain q=0.02326 per year. This qvalue corresponds to a population growth rate of 2.3% per year, which is less than the recent censusvalue of 3.3% growth per year, but this dierence may occur because our model isa simplication of the actual demographics. The value d+q=0.045 per year is consistent with the Niger population surviving fraction as a function of age, which isvery close to the exponential e 0.045afor ageain years. Recall that the replacement number Ris 1 at the endemic equilibrium for this model. Using the values of d+q,, and, (5.15) and (5.16) can be solved iteratively to obtain a basic reproduction number of R0=1 7.4 and a susceptible fraction at age 0o fs0=1.6\u00d7106. Thus in this population nearly every mother is infected with measles before childbearing age, so almost every newborn child has passive immunity.In the limit as s 00, (5.15) becomes R0=[ 1+/(d+q)][1+(d+q)/], which also leads to R0=1 7.4. This value is a reasonable approximation to the value ofR0=1 8.83 estimated above in the MSEIR model with 16 age groups. The average age of infection of A=1.8 years can be found from either (5.12) or the approximation A=1/(+d)+1/(+d). This value is less than the value of A=2.4 years estimated above using the MSEIR model with 16 age groups; this dierence may be due to thehigh infant mortality that occurs in the model with age groups. Using the estimatedparameter values and a vaccination age of A v=0.75 years (9 months) in the herd immunity condition (5.24), we nd that to achieve herd immunity the successfullyvaccinated fraction gat age 9 months must satisfy g0.98. A measles vaccine ecacy of 0.95 implies that the fraction vaccinated would have to be 1.03, which isimpossible to achieve with a program that has at most one vaccination per person.This result is conrmed by the measles computer simulations for Niger, in which herdimmunity is not achieved when all children are vaccinated at age 9 months.

ApplicationtoPertussisintheUnitedStates. Previous estimates [12, p. 70] of 10 to 18 for R0for pertussis (whooping cough) are based on the formula R0= 1+L/A, which is derived in sections 5.4 or 5.6 for SEIR or SIR models of a disease that confers permanent immunity in a uniform, homogeneously mixing population.However, these estimates of R 0are not realistic, because pertussis gives only tempo- rary immunity and spreads by heterogeneous mixing. In the age-structured epidemi-ologic models developed specically for pertussis [105, 106], there are 32 age groups.Using fertilities and death rates from United States census information for 1990, thevalue ofqin (4.12) corresponds to 0.065% growth per year, which is nearly zero. Thus the age distribution in the pertussis models is assumed to have become stable with aconstant population size. More details and graphs of the actual and theoretical agedistributions are given in [105]. Immunity to pertussis is temporary, because the agent Bordetella pertussis is bacterial, in contrast to the viral agents for measles, mumps, and rubella. As the timeafter the most recent pertussis infection increases, the relative immunity of a persondecreases. When people become infected again, the severity of their symptoms and,consequently, their transmission eectiveness (i.e., their infectivity) depends on theirlevel of immunity at the time of infection. Thus people with lower immunity havemoresymptomsandhigherinfectivity. Ofcourse, infectedpeoplewhowerepreviouslyfully susceptible are generally the most eective transmitters. In the age-structuredpertussis models [105, 106], the epidemiological classes include a susceptible class S, an infective class I, a classR 4of those removed people with very high immunity, and classes R3,R2, andR1for those with decreasing immunity. In the two pertussis models, there are three or four levels of infectivity and 32 age groups, so that notall infectives are equally eective in creating new infectives [106]. Infectives in thoseage groups that mix more with other age groups are more eective transmitters thanthose in age groups that mix less. Thus it might seem necessary in considering R 0to dene a \"typical infective\" by using some type of average over all infectivities and agegroups, so that R 0would be the average number of secondary cases produced when a \"typical infective\" is introduced into a completely susceptible population. In the nextparagraph, we explain why averaging over age groups is necessary, but averaging overclasses with dierent infectivities is not appropriate. The occurrence of the rst infection in a fully susceptible population seems to be an unpredictable process, because it depends on random introductions of infectiousoutsiders into the host population. The probability that a rst infection occurs in thehost population depends on the infectivity of the outside invader, on how the invader(with a mixing activity level based on its age group) mixes in the host population,and the length of time that the invader is in the population. It is clear that outsideinvaders from high infectivity classes and high mixing activity age groups are morelikely to create a rst new infection in a host population, especially if they are inthe population for their entire infectious period. We believe that the denition of R 0 should not depend on the circumstances under which an outsider creates a rst case, but on whether or not an infection with a rst case can persist in a fully susceptiblepopulation. After the rst infection in the host population, the infected people in the next generations could be less eective transmitters, so that the infection would die out.Thus the denition of R 0should be based on the circumstances under which a disease with a rst case would really invade a fully susceptible host population more exten-sively. In order for an infection to survive the rst 10 or 20 generations, so that it Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226. Redistribution subject to SIAM license or copyright; see http://www.siam.org/journals/ojsa.php THE MATHEMATICS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES 641 really does invade and persist in the new host population, the number of secondary cases produced by infectious members of the host population must exceed 1. Thus R0 should be the number of secondary cases produced by averaging over all age groups of the infectives that have not been previously infected. Because all of the cases in therst generations of an invasion occur in fully susceptible people, only infectives whowere previously fully susceptible are relevant. Thus R 0is calculated for the SIR 4 part of the pertussis models and it is not necessary to average over the classes with various infectivity levels. Although the SIR model formula (6.8) for R0works for the pertussis models, the formula (6.7) for the constant kin the forces of infection i=kbiat the endemic equilibrium does not work, because the pertussis models have temporary immunity and classes with dierent infectivities. The fertilities fj, death rate constants dj, and transfer rate constants cjare determined in the demographic model. The average infectious period is 21 days, sothat the rate constant is 1/21. The form of separable mixing used in the pertussis model is proportionate mixing, which has activity levels l jin each of the 32 age groups.

Neitherofthetwomethodsusedtondapproximationsof R0formeaslesinNiger works for the pertussis models. The replacement number Rat the pertussis endemic equilibrium depends on the fractions infected in all of the three or four infectiveclasses. For example, in the rst pertussis model R=/summationtext 32 j=1j(sj+r1j+r2j)Pj/(+dj) /summationtext32 j=1(ij+imj+iwj)Pj, whereij,imj,andiwjaretheinfectiveprevalencesinthefull-,mild-,andweak-disease classesI,Im, andIw.

Thus it is not possible to use the estimate of the contact number during the computer simulations as an approxima- tion forR0in the pertussis models. Since the age distribution of the population in the United States is poorly approximated by a negative exponential and the force ofinfection is not constant, the second method used for measles in Niger also does notwork to approximate R 0for pertussis in the United States. Theultimategoalofapertussisvaccinationprogramistovaccinateenoughpeople to get the replacement number less than 1, so that pertussis fades away and herd immunity is achieved. Because the mixing for pertussis is not homogeneous and theimmunity is not permanent, we cannot use the simple criterion for herd immunitythat the fraction with vaccine-induced or infection-induced immunity is greater than11/R 0. Indeed, the low numerical R0values of 5.4 and 3.7 for a disease like pertussis with waning immunity do not indicate that herd immunity for pertussis iseasy to achieve. None of the vaccination strategies, including those that give boostervaccinations every ve years, has achieved herd immunity in the pertussis computersimulations [105, 106]. 9. OtherEpidemiologyModelswithThresholds. The results presented in this paper provide a theoretical background for reviewing some previous results. In thissection we do not attempt to cite all papers on infectious disease models with agestructure, heterogeneity, and spatial structure, but primarily cite sources that con-sider thresholds and the basic reproduction number R 0. The cited papers reflect the author's interests, but additional references are given in these papers and in the booksand survey papers listed in the introduction. We refer the reader to other sourcesfor information on stochastic epidemiology models [18, 20, 56, 59, 66, 81, 128, 167],discrete time models [2, 3], 194], and wildlife disease models [90]. Age-structured epidemiology models with either continuous age or age groups are essentialfortheincorporationofage-relatedmixingbehavior,fertilityrates,anddeathrates, for the estimation of R 0from age-specic data, and for the comparison of vac- cination strategies with age-specic risk groups and age-dependent vaccination rates.Indeed, some of the early epidemiology models incorporated continuous age structure[24, 136]. Modern mathematical analysis of age-structured models appears to havestartedwithHoppensteadt[114], whoformulatedepidemiologymodelswithbothcon-tinuous chronological age and infection class age (time since infection), showed thatthey were well posed, and found threshold conditions for endemicity. Expressions forR 0for models with both chronological and infection age were obtained by Dietz and Schenzle [68]. In age-structured epidemiology models, proportionate and preferredmixing parameters can be estimated from age-specic force of infection data [103].Mathematical aspects such as existence and uniqueness of solutions, steady states,stability, and thresholds have now been analyzed for many epidemiology models withage structure; more references are cited in the following papers. These SIS and SIRmodels with continuous age structure have included vertical transmission [33, 34, 72],age-dependent disease transmission [14, 61, 91, 189], age [186, 197],cross immunity 16], and vaccination patterns [86, 87, 94, 135, 165, 175]. Age-structured models have been used in the epidemiology modeling many dis- eases [12]. measles and rubella vaccination strategies.

Hethcote [99] considered optimal ages of vacci- nation for measles on three continents. Halloran et al. [93], Ferguson, Anderson, andGarnett[78],andSchuetteandHethcote[179]usedage-structuredmodelstostudytheeectsofvaricella(chickenpox)vaccinationprograms. GrenfellandAnderson[89]andHethcote[105,106]haveusedage-structuredmodelsinevaluatingpertussis(whoopingcough) vaccination programs. Irregular and biennial oscillations of measles incidenceshave led to various mathematical analyses including the following seven modeling ex-planations, some of which involve age structure. Yorke and London [200] proposedSEIR models with seasonal forcing in delay dierential equations. Dietz [62] proposedsubharmonic resonance in model using ordinary dierentialequations. Schenzle [177] used computer simulations to show that the measles out-break patterns in England and Germany could be explained by the primary schoolyearly calenders and entry ages. Olson and Schaer [169] proposed chaotic behav-ior in simple deterministic SEIR models. Bolker and Grenfell [27] proposed realisticage-structured models with seasonal forcing and stochastic terms. Ferguson, Nokes,and Anderson [79] proposed nely age-stratied models with stochastic fluctuationsthat can shift the dynamics between biennial and triennial cycle attractors. Earn etal. [71] proposed a simple, time-forced SEIR model with slow variation in the averagerate of recruitment of new susceptibles. In recent years HIV, which leads to AIDS, has emerged as an important new infectious disease. Many age-structured models have been developed for HIV/AIDS.May and Anderson [154] found R 0for some simple HIV transmission models. Bon- gaarts [28] and May, Anderson, and McLean [156] used models with age structureto examine the demographic eects of AIDS in African countries. The book [39]by Castillo-Chavez contains a review of HIV/AIDS modeling papers including single-group models, multiple-group models, and epidemiologic-demographic models. It alsocontains papers on AIDS models with HIV class age, variable infectivity, distributionsfortheAIDSincubationperiod, heterogeneity, andstructuredmixing. BusenbergandCastillo-Chavez [32] found an an HIV model with variable infec- tivity and continuous chronological and HIV class age structure and proportionatemixing. Hyman, Li, and Stanley [120] generalized these results on R 0to HIV models with nonproportionate mixing and discrete or continuous risk. For many infectious diseases the transmission occurs in a diverse population, so the epidemiological model must divide the heterogeneous population into subpopula-tions or groups, in which the members have similar characteristics. This division intogroups can be based not only on mode of transmission, contact patterns, latent pe-riod, infectious period, genetic susceptibility or resistance, and amount of vaccinationor chemotherapy, but also on social, cultural, economic, demographic, or geographicfactors. For these models it is useful to nd R 0from the threshold conditions for invasion and endemicity and to prove stability of the equilibria. For the SIS modelwithngroups, thethresholdwasrstfoundintermsofwhether s(A)0ors(A)>0, wheres(A) is the largest real part of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix Aat the disease-free equilibrium. The seminal paper [140] of Lajmanovich and Yorke foundthis threshold condition and proved the global stability of the disease-free and en-demic equilibria using Liapunov functions. This approach has been extended to SIR,SEIR, and SEIRS models with ngroups [97, 187, 188]. For these models R 0can be shown to be the spectral radius of a next generation matrix that is related to theJacobian matrix A[103, 110]. This next generation operator approach has also been used for epidemiology models with a variety of features such as proportionate mix- Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226.

HETHCOTE ing, preferred mixing, heterosexual transmission, host-vector groups, multiple mixing groups, vaccination, and age structure [58, 59]. For proportionate mixing models withmultiple interacting groups, the basic reproduction number R 0is the contact number , which is the weighted average of the contact numbers in the groups [103, 110, 113]. The sexual transmission of diseases often occurs in a very heterogeneous population,because people with more sexual partners have more opportunities to be infectedand to infect others. The basic reproduction number R 0has been determined for many dierent models with heterogeneous mixing involving core, social, and sexualmixing groups [113, 129, 131, 138, 139, 184]. It has been shown that estimates ofR 0, under the false assumption that a heterogeneously mixing population is homoge- neously mixing, are not greater than the actual R0for the heterogeneous population [1,103]. Manymodelswithheterogeneityintheformofcompetingstrainsofinfectiousagents have been considered for diseases such as influenza, dengue, and myxomatosis[17, 40, 41, 42, 63, 70, 73, 74, 76, 155, 160]. HIV/AIDS is spread in a very heterogeneous population by heterosexual inter- course, homosexual intercourse, and sharing of needles by injecting drug users. Be-cause of the great diversity and heterogeneity among those at risk of HIV/AIDS,modeling this disease is a challenging task [6, 12, 39, 104, 115, 118, 119, 126, 130].For HIV/AIDS models with a continuous distribution of sexual activity levels andwith various preference mixing functions, the proportionate mixing has been shownto be the only separable solution, and expressions for the basic reproduction numberR 0intheproportionatemixingcasehavebeenfound[26,32]. Expressionsfor R0have also been found for HIV/AIDS models using groups of people based on their sexualbehavior, e.g., homosexual men, bisexual men, heterosexual women, and heterosexualmen, with further subdivisions based on their numbers of sexual or needle-sharingpartners. For staged progression models for HIV/AIDS with many infectious classeswith dierent infectivities, the basic reproduction number R 0is often the weighted average of the basic reproduction numbers in the infectious classes, where the weightsinvolve the fraction of contacts (or partners) that result in an infection and the prob-ability of reaching that infectious stage [111, 121, 122, 132, 146]. There is clear evidence that infectious diseases spread geographically and maps with isodate spread contours have been produced [12, 55, 158, 166]. Some estimatedspeedsofpropagationare30-60kilometersperyearforfoxrabiesinEuropestartingin1939 [166], 18-24 miles per year for raccoon rabies in the Eastern United States start-ing in 1977 [49], about 140 miles per year for the plague in Europe in 1347-1350 [166],and worldwide in one year for influenza in the 20th century [176]. Epidemiology mod-elswithspatialstructureshavebeenusedtodescribespatialheterogeneity[12,96,110]and the spatial spread of infectious diseases [38, 54, 59, 90, 166, 193]. There seem tobe two types of spatial epidemiology models [163, 193]. Diusion epidemiology mod-els are formulated from nonspatial models by adding diusion terms correspondingto the random movements each day of susceptibles and infectives. Dispersal-kernelmodels are formulated by using integral equations with kernels describing daily con-tacts of infectives with their neighbors. For both types of spatial epidemiology modelsin innite domains, one often determines the thresholds (sometimes in terms of R 0) above which a traveling waveexists, nds the minimum speed of propagation and the asymptotic speed of propagation (which is usually shown to be equal to the minimumspeed), and determines the stability of the traveling wave to p erturbations [161, 172]. For spatial models in nite domains, stationary states and their stability have beeninvestigated [38]. For stochastic spatial models there is also a threshold condition, so Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226.

Discussion. Mathematicalepidemiologyhasnowevolvedintoaseparatearea ofpopulationdynamicsthatisparalleltomathematicalecology. Epidemiologymodelsare now used to combine complex data from various sources in order to study equallycomplexoutcomes. InthispaperwehavefocusedontheroleofthebasicreproductionnumberR 0, which is dened as the average number of people infected when a typical infectiveentersanentirelysusceptiblepopulation. WehaveillustratedthesignicanceofR 0by obtaining explicit expressions for R0and proving threshold results which imply that a disease can invade a completely susceptible population if and only ifR 0>1. Using the SIR endemic model without age structure, the estimates of R0for various diseases in section 2.5 show that some diseases are more easily spread thanothers, so that they are more dicult to control or eradicate. These dierences areveried for six diseases in section 2.6. For the basic endemic models without age structure, the expressions for the basic reproduction number R 0are intuitively obvious as the product of the contact rate, the average infectious period, and the fraction surviving the latent period (providedthere is an exposed class in the model). But for more complicated models, expressionsforR 0must be derived from threshold conditions for the stability of the disease-free equilibrium or the existence of an endemic equilibrium in the feasible region. Thisapproach was used in section 3 for the MSEIR model without age structure, but withan exponentially changing population size. Many epidemiology models now used tostudy infectious diseases involve age structures, because fertilities, death rates, andcontact rates all depend on the ages of the individuals. Thus the basic reproductionnumberR 0must be found for these epidemiologic-demographic models. For SEIR, SEIRS, and SEIS models, expressions for R0are given by (5.9) and (6.6) when the demographic structures are continuous age and age groups, respec-tively. Analogous expressions for R 0for the SIR, SIRS, and SIS models are given by (5.11) and (6.8). These expressions for R0are found by examining when there is a positive (endemic) equilibrium in the feasible region, and then it is veried that thedisease persists if and only if R 0>1. To illustrate the application of the theoretical formulas for R0in models with age groups, two applications have been included in this paper. Based on demographicand epidemiologic estimates for measles in Niger, Africa, the value of the basic repro-duction number found from (6.6) in section 7 is R 0=1 8.8. The interesting aspect of this measles application is that R0is found for a very rapidly growing population. In contrast, the current fertility and death data in the United States suggests that thepopulation is approaching a stable age distribution with constant total size. Usingpreviously developed models for pertussis (whooping cough) in which the immunityis temporary [105, 106], the basic reproduction numbers are estimated in section 8 tobeR 0=5.4 andR0=3.7 for two pertussis models. It is interesting that these basic reproduction numbers are found using the R0expression derived for an SIR model, even though pertussis immunity is temporary. Recall from section 2.2 that the contact number is the average number of ad- equate contacts of a typical infective during the infectious period. The interestingaspect of the pertussis calculations is that new types of infectives with lower infectiv-ityoccuraftertheinvasion, becauseinfectedpeoplewhopreviouslyhadpertussishavelower infectivity when reinfected. Thus typical infectives after the invasion includethose who have lower infectivities than the infectives who had been fully suscepti- Downloaded 01/22/14 to 137.110.36.226.

Although the contact number is equal toR0when pertussis rst invades the population, the new broader collection of typical infectives implies that <R 0after the invasion. Using numerical approximations during the computer simulations, thecontact numbers at the endemic equilibrium are estimated in section 8 to be =3 for the rst age group pertussis model and =1.8 for the second pertussis model. This phenomenon that <R 0at the endemic equilibrium also holds for three rela- tively simple pertussis models based on ordinary dierential equations [108]. For thepertussis model with four removed groups [108], the three infective classes withdecreasing infectivity where the infective classes ImandIware nonempty as soon as pertussis has invaded. For this model the contact number satises =R0[I+mIm+wIw]/[I+Im+Iw]<R 0, because the relative infectivities mandware less than 1. As pointed out in section 2.2 the basic reproduction number R0, the contact number , and the replacement numberRare all equal at the time when the disease invades the population. For nearly all models R0=>Rafter the invasion, but for the pertussis models, R0>>R after the invasion. Thus the pertussis models have led to an entirely new way of thinking about the dierences between the contact number and the basic reproduction number R0. Acknowledgments.
