Our offerings include Acupuncture, Massage, Lymphatic Drainage, Reflexology, Holistic Facials, Wellness Consultations, Private Yoga, custom-blended herbal tea, and an assortment of traditional Chinese remedies. With the skill and knowledge of our practitioners, combined with the Western, Ayurvedic, and Chinese loose herbs found in our natural apothecary, we hope to facilitate powerful and lasting change for each person who walks through our door. What is Holistic Health? Holistic medicine is a method of healing that focuses on the person as a whole with the aim of preventing health issues, rather than treating specific symptoms. Holistic health considers all the elements that influence a person's health: their body, thoughts, emotions, spirit, and environment. Mind-Body Connection The holistic care philosophy is deeply rooted in balance and equilibrium. Holistic practitioners must take the complex relationship between mind and body into account when addressing imbalances. Your physical health affects your mental state, and vice-versa. Examining the effects of [modern-day stress](https://blog.arogya.net/combating-modern-day-stress/ ) on the body perfectly exemplifies this mind-body connection. Stress is a natural part of the human experience, but ongoing, heightened stress levels can have a disastrous impact on overall health. How to Start Your Wellness Journey Holistic healing is a continuous process that begins with a personal commitment to improving one's well-being and our [wellness consultations](https://www.arogya.net/traditional-chinese-medicine#wellness-consultation) are an excellent way to jumpstart your journey to better health. Through one-on-one consultations, our team of licensed healing practitioners can work with you to establish a personalized treatment plan and guide you to develop healthy routines. This therapeutic plan may involve nutrition, herbal supplement, and lifestyle recommendations, in addition to complementary therapies such as acupuncture, massage and bodywork, yoga, and others. Our Holistic Approach to Wellness To take a holistic approach to medicine means to treat a person not only physically, but mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. This balanced approach acknowledges that if a person has an imbalance in one area of their life it can negatively impact their overall health. At Arogya, we provide a comprehensive program of holistic healing modalities to reduce and manage pain, relieve stress, improve energy, and enhance immunity. The [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)](https://nccih.nih.gov/), which is part of the National Institutes of Health, grouped these complementary therapies and practices under the following categories: Mind-Body Practices Mind-Body techniques combine mental focus, mindfulness, controlled breathing, and body movements to help manage pain, reduce stress, and improve mood and overall health. Examples include Yoga, Guided Meditation, and Qigong Lung Exercises. Body-Based Therapy Body-Based therapy methods focus on manual manipulation, touch, or movement of the physical body to relieve pain, ease tension, improve circulation, and encourage relaxation and rejuvenation. Examples include Massage Therapy, Reflexology, and Craniosacral Therapy. Whole Medical Systems Whole medical systems are complete systems of theory and practice that have developed independently from conventional Western medicine. These traditional systems of medicine are often based around a defining philosophy. Examples include Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic Medicine. Natural Products This category includes a variety of plant-based or naturally derived products. Aromatherapy and botanical medicine are the most common variants. Products include herbal supplements, teas, essential oils, and botanical extracts.
