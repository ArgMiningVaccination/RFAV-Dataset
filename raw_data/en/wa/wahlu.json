You have had a biopsy of your cervix, which means that a very small sample of tissue has been removed from your cervix. Risks No major risks. Benefits Allows confirmation of the findings at the colposcopy examination. Why did I have a biopsy taken? Your Colposcopy examination showed an area on your cervix which may contain abnormal cells. The biopsy will be sent to the laboratory to be analysed. The result will tell us whether abnormal cells are present or not. What will I expect to happen now? You may experience some or none of the following: - Discomfort like period pain or cramps for the next few hours\u2014you can take paracetamol and/or ibuprofen for this. Some red or brown discharge for the next few days and possible light bleeding To reduce the risk of bleeding and infection we suggest that you take the following precautions until any bleeding/discharge has stopped, which is usually within 3-7 days: - Use sanitary towels rather than tampons - Shower instead of having a bath - Avoid sexual intercourse - Avoid swimming pools/hot tubs - Avoid strenuous exercise such as aerobics classes, running, martial arts - Avoid any overseas travel (flying anywhere abroad) for 7 days\u2014if you do travel, remember it can be difficult to get medical attention when abroad and you may not be covered by your travel insurance Who do I contact for queries or advice if something is wrong? If you notice any of the following symptoms below we would advise you to contact us (during working hours) or see your GP: - Persistent bleeding for more than 7 days - Heavy bleeding - Offensive vaginal discharge - Lower abdominal pain - Fever In an emergency we would recommend that you go to your nearest A&E. When will my results be available? In approximately 2-4 weeks. A letter will be sent to your home address and also to your GP. It is important that we have your correct address, telephone number and GP details. Please inform us of any changes as it is your responsibility to keep your records updated. If you do not receive your results within six weeks then please contact the colposcopy clinic. What will happen if the biopsy does not show abnormal cells? Your follow-up will depend on why you were referred to the colposcopy clinic and what the colposcopy examination suggested. You will either be discharged back to the care of your GP or be given a further follow-up appointment in the colposcopy clinic. What will happen if the biopsy result shows that I do have abnormal cells? If the cells are only mildly abnormal (CIN1) you will require a further cervical smear in 12 months' time and this will be done either at the GP surgery or again in the colposcopy clinic. This will give the cells a chance to return to normal on their own. If the smear test is taken at the GP surgery and is abnormal again you will be referred back to the colposcopy clinic. If you have been having mildly abnormal cells for two years then treatment (Loop Diathermy Excision) will be discussed with you. If the cells are moderately (CIN2) or severely (CIN3) abnormal you will be asked to come back for a minor treatment called Loop Diathermy Excision, as these cells do not usually return to normal on their own. For information on Loop Diathermy Excision please refer to 'Loop Diathermy Excision' patient information leaflet. How can I reduce my risk in the future? - Smoking: You should be aware that smoking can make cervical changes occur more rapidly and they are more likely to persist or come back following treatment - Condoms: Consider using a condom during sexual intercourse\u2014this may help reduce the spread of HPV - Lifestyle: It is important to have a healthy lifestyle (such as a low fat, high fibre diet and regular exercise to boost the immune system) Further information - NHS Direct: [www.nhs.uk](http://www.nhs.uk/)or call 111 for advice outside clinic hours - NHS Cervical Screening Programme website: [www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/cervical](http://www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk/cervical) - British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology website: [www.bsccp.org.uk](http://www.bsccp.org.uk/) Contact information Chelsea and Westminster Hospital Colposcopy Clinic Gynaecology Outpatients 1st Floor, Lift Bank T: University Hospital Colposcopy Clinic Women's Day Unit, 1st Floor Queen Mary's "}
