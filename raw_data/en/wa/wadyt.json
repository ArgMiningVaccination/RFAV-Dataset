But there is no reason to experience further pain and suffering simply because you've decided to stop using. Situated in our beautiful, home-like [residential treatment centers](/about/tour/), our medical detox program offers you a safe and comfortable way to withdraw from [alcohol](/what-we-treat/alcohol/), [opiates, benzodiazepines](/what-we-treat/prescription-drug/) and other drugs that are known to cause serious physiological and psychological withdrawal symptoms. If you've been using drugs or alcohol heavily, stopping suddenly can be dangerous or even life-threatening. Due to the serious consequences associated with detox, the safest way to stop using substances is to seek out a medically-supervised program \u2014 like the one offered here at ARC. While they can vary from individual to individual, the physiological and psychological symptoms common during a typical detox include: - Cold sweats - Fever - Nausea - Vomiting - Restlessness - Mood swings - Insomnia - Muscle aches - Severe gastrointestinal upset - Pain - Seizure - Psychological disturbances, and more When you undergo a medically supervised detox, the chance of experiencing any of these concerning side effects, like seizure, is greatly reduced or eliminated. Plus, if you do have any of the symptoms listed above, our medical team will be right by your side ready to act and to provide medical treatment if warranted. Under the guidance and supervision of our medical team, we will utilize medication assisted treatment (MAT) if your doctor believes that it is medically and clinically appropriate. This will help to reduce and manage discomfort, if necessary, as MAT helps to normalize brain chemistry, relieve cravings and normalize body functions. With support from our team, you'll experience a far more comfortable detox in treatment compared to home, and you'll be able to get the rest that you need. Upon intake, you will meet with a physician to determine the best course of action for your medically supervised detox. Together, we'll set up an individualized detox treatment plan and provide you with a safe, soothing place to rest and recover. Under the supervision of our physician and nursing staff, we'll monitor your vital signs around the clock. At this time, we can prescribe medications to [treat mental health symptoms](/what-we-treat/cooccurring/), like anxiety or depression, should you need them. And we can prescribe medicines to help you relax and sleep during this challenging time. We'll gently encourage you to attend treatment programming during your detox so you can become integrated into the community. However, we do understand that sometimes the best thing you can do for yourself in those first few days is rest. Once your appetite returns, you'll have access to three meals a day prepared by our in-house chef. As you start to feel better, you'll start attending [individual and group therapy](/treatment-program/clinical-therapies/) and [12-step meetings](/treatment-program/12-step-program/) on site. You'll also have access to counselors and staff members 24/7 should you need emotional support or a team member to talk to. Our Joint Commission-accredited sub-acute medical detox program is offered in inviting homes located in a residential neighborhood in West L.A. With a small patient-to-staff ratio, we can give you the attention you need to ensure your health, [safety](/covid-clean-commitment/) and comfort during detox and for your entire stay in treatment with us. Medical detox is just the first step on the road to recovery \u2014 it is not to be mistaken with addiction treatment. During detox, you end the physiological addiction, but the core issues that led you to want to use in the first place will still remain. Following detox, you'll start attending various support groups as well as individual therapy sessions in our [residential treatment program](/treatment-program/residential/) \u2014 setting you on the path to full recovery. You don't need to go through this alone. To find out if our sub-acute medical detox program is right for you, please call to speak to one of our caring staff members today. "}
