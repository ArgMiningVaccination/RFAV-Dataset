Labeling chiropractic care for children as \"experimental and invcstigational.\" BC/BS is seeking to intimidate parents into believing that chiropractic care is not safe or effective for children. Reality Doctors of Chiropractic have been adjusting children for over 100 years. The reported incidence of malpractice with children is extremely minimal. As one chiropractic insurance claims adjuster told me, \"In fifteen years, I have seen maybe five cases of malpractice involving children. Most of them had to do witli the child tripping over the adjusting table or some similar type equipment-related injury.\" The current attempt by BC/BS to intimidate parents' rights to choose is absurd, considering all of the on-going treatments their policies cover without question. Listed below are just a few current scenarios where questionable treatment protocols for our country's children were established by conventional medicine without the sufficient documentation to substantiate their safety and efficacy. These services were accepted and covered without a blink and, now, current published research studies are revealing the danger and ineffectiveness of these \"approved\" treatments.\" To add insult to injury to the consumer, these experimental treatments are still covered by insurance policies, in spite of the new findings! If your patients arc faced with this apparent dichotomy in insurance policy coverage, their insurance companies need to know that your patients arc not willing to have their intelligence insulted and their rights to choose denied. Change will come with consumer demand. Unquestioned, Routine Procedures The following scenarios are just a few examples where this double standard in health care coverage is revealed.... Unnecessary ttu shots: Last year there was a huge push for flu shots for infants. There was no data to substantiate it. Now, a new study, published in The Lancet, found that flu shots don't really work in children younger than two years of age. In addition, the scientists said they '\"recorded no convincing evidence that vaccines can reduce mortality, hospital admissions, serious complications and community transmission of influenza\" in young kids. The interesting point to note here is that, without any scientific data for efficacy, the flu shot was recommended and paid for. Also interesting is the fact that the flu shot, like all vaccines, is considered \"prcvcntative medicine\" and, frequently, chiropractic care is denied because it is preventative care. Leading Drug Company Deceives Parents: It was bad enough that the toxic substance thimerosal was ever put into vaccines without even testing its effects; however, what is even worse is when it was finally exposed that thimerosal may be having adverse effects on children, a leading drug company continued to supply the infant hepatitis B vaccine, still contaminated with thimerosal, for two years after announcing that it had eliminated the toxin from the vaccine. It was September 1999, in the midst of concerns about the risks of mercury in childhood vaccines, when Merck stated that the FDA had approved a preservative-free version of the vaccine. Despite Merck's news release that stated, \"Now, Merck's infant vaccine line is free of all preservatives,\" the company still distributed the vaccine containing thimerosal until October 2001. Again, it is interesting to note that, in spite of the known toxicity of thimerosal and its presence in childhood vaccines, insurance companies continued to cover these contaminated vaccines without any control standards of safety for the covered vaccine. Ritalin and Cancer Risks: The rise in the use of Ritalin in this country is frightening. In an alarming study conducted at the University of Texas, researchers have discovered that every child they tested who was taking Ritalin (methylphenidate) developed chromosomal aberrations that have been associated with an increased risk of cancer. The researchers tested 12 children before and three months after beginning a daily Ritalin prescription for treatment of ADHD. Every child experienced an increase in genetic damage that is associated with the development of cancer after taking the drug. In the words of the authors, \"In every individual examined, there was a statistically significant increase in every genotoxic endpoint analyzed...for each of the parameters tested.\" While there has been significant criticism and cause for alarm in prescribing psychotropic drugs to children, rather than a decrease of use, the amount of children taking these drugs has escalated in the past few years. With all the literature cautioning its use, how can this be? Perhaps the accessibility of Ritalin and other drugs via \"health\" insurance coverage may be contributing to the frightening rise in its use? It remains to be seen whether the insurance industry will act on behalf of our children's safety and question their routine coverage for these experimental and investigational substances.
