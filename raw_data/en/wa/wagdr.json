Dr. Rochelle Neally /ringbutton3Pediatrics was offered in the curriculum at West Coast Chiropractic College in Oakland,CA in 1915. Los Angeles College of Chiropractic offered 50 hour course in pediatrics by 1919. 1954 Dr. Lorraine Golden dedicated her practice to serving physically and mentally handicapped, emotionally disturbed and learning disabled children. Became Kentuckian Children's Center /ringbutton3Oklahaven Children's Center was established in 1963. 1977 Dr. Bobby Doscher was director. /ringbutton31975, Dr. Larry Webster founded ICPA, International Chiropractic Pediatric Association. /ringbutton3In-utero constraint occurring in the last trimester of pregnancy may be an extrinsic factor for biomechanical stresses on the cartilaginous spine of the fetus. /ringbutton3The average length of the spine of the neonate is approximately 20cm. Within the first 24 months of life, the length of the spine will grow to approximately 45cm. /ringbutton3Largely composed of cartilaginous material up to 6 years old. /ringbutton3This does NOT contraindicate specific adjustments /ringbutton3Areas most susceptible to biomechanical stress are transitional areas C0-C1 and L5-S1. /ringbutton3Causes of subluxation: In-utero constraint, birth trauma, vacuum extraction, c-section, accidental injury. Hyperextension and hyper flexion during car accidents, sports, bicycles. /ringbutton3Long term biomechanical strain leads deprives the disc tissue of needed nutrition, eventually leading to degeneration. APGAR: Heart Rate- less than 100 weak, over 100 Respiratory Effort- Weak cry vs. strong cry Muscle Tone- limp, some flexion, good flexion Reflex Irritability- no response, some motion, cry Color- pale-blue, pink, some blue, pink 7-10 Normal 4-6 moderately depressed, 0-3 severely depressed. /ringbutton3Infants have no teeth and insufficient salivary secretions necessary for starch breakdown, significant concentrations of these enzymes are not present until the first teeth appear (approx. 5-7 months) /ringbutton3Breakdown of more complex starches occurs in the small intestines and involves pancreatic amylase. Most pediatric GI authorities assert that this essential enzyme does not appear until around 15 months. /ringbutton3Newborns stomach secretions contain pepsin and hydrochloric acid which, along with the pancreatic enzyme trypsin effectively breakdown the specific proteins, minerals and fats present in breast milk. /ringbutton3The walls of the infants small intestines are extremely permeable during the first 9 months ensuring maximum absorption but with less discretion than that of a mature gut. /ringbutton36-9 months generally the earliest age for new food and beverage introduction. /ringbutton39-12 months when infants digestive tract has developed is sufficient enough to handle foods other than breast milk. /ringbutton3Should have understanding of rotational diet plan. /ringbutton3Start with one food at a time and continue for 3-4 days provided there are no signs of intolerance. /ringbutton3Fruits are good first choices /ringbutton3In season fruits locally grown. Organic. /ringbutton3Start with juicier fruits (peaches, pears, melons ect.) /ringbutton3Freshly prepared juices rather than whole mashed to begin /ringbutton3Require little digestion for adequate absorption and utilization. /ringbutton3They contain an abundance of vitamins and minerals /ringbutton3They are an excellent source of energy rich in natural carbohydrates /ringbutton3Infants take to them well due to high water content /ringbutton3Similar protein content to breast milk. /ringbutton3Start with freshly prepared juices of carrots, squash, beets, celery, cucumber, zucchini. /ringbutton3Best diluted 4 parts water to 1 part fresh juice. When certain of tolerance, the dilution may slowly be reduced. /ringbutton3Raw is best to ensure all enzymes and nutrients remain intact. /ringbutton3Growing number of experts agree that grains are less likely to be properly digested until ages 1-1.5 yrs. /ringbutton3Don't rush into diet /ringbutton3Because of frequency of allergy and intolerance to wheat and other gluten containing grains (barley, oats, rye) it is suggested that they are introduced last. /ringbutton3Non-gluten grains (brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth) are better choices when introducing grains for the first time. /ringbutton3Redness around the mouth within 1-2 hours, or redness around anus within 12-24 hours. /ringbutton3Abdominal bloating, gas and distention. /ringbutton3Irritability, of atlas.(check laterality) /ringbutton3The processes in the lumbars. to the tubercles in the sacral segments. /ringbutton3Use gentle lateral flexion and rotation to feel for fixation between atlas and occiput. Motion only upper cervical, not entire spine. /ringbutton3C2-C7, motion by using a gentle P-A glide. Support head gently and contact either the spinous or posterior aspect of lamina-pedicle junction. /ringbutton3Thoracics, use index finger or index finger and thumb at base of spinouses and check for P-A glide. /ringbutton3Lumbars, try to have child lay prone on your lap or parents lap. /ringbutton3SI joints can be motioned by laying child prone. Palpate SI joint and lifting ipsilateral leg. Fixation and edema in the upper part of joint would indicate PI ilium. Lower part would indicate AS ilium. /ringbutton3Older children you can have him/her sit on adjusting bench with you behind them. Place your thumbs on both PSIS's and have the child spread knees apart and then together. When knees are apart, both thumbs should converge equally toward the second sacral tubercle. The one with the least movement is the involved side. /ringbutton3Newborn- 1 \u00bd years /ringbutton3Inability to lift head /ringbutton3Trouble latching on /ringbutton3Cries when placed prone/cannot life head /ringbutton3Difficult nursing/ prefers one side /ringbutton3Body looks asymmetrical /ringbutton3Absent big toe dig /ringbutton3Hands never relax or open /ringbutton3Dull look /ringbutton3Lack of energy in eyes /ringbutton3Unresponsive to loud sounds- hypo /ringbutton3Responds to many stimuli- hyper /ringbutton3Does not like being held /ringbutton3Lack of eye contact /ringbutton3Inconsolable crying /ringbutton3Tongue- protruding, flat /ringbutton3Intracranial central nervous system lesions may lead to postural abnormalities, particularly persistent asymmetries. /ringbutton3Extension of the extremities. Marked extension of the head, stiffness of the neck. /ringbutton3CAN MEAN SIGNIFICANT MENINGEAL OR BRAINSTEM IRRITATION. (infection or hemorrhage) /ringbutton3Sensory exam- limited /ringbutton3Cranial nerve 12- pinching the nostrils, there should be a reflexive opening of the mouth and a raising of the tip of the tongue. /ringbutton3If 12 th cranial nerve paresis is present, the tip of the tongue will deviate towards the affected side. /ringbutton3Responses to stimuli form a large part of the exam. (Moro, dorsal, dazzle reflex ect..) /ringbutton3Primitive reflexes are primarily tested with suspected brain injury for the purpose of assessing frontal lobe functioning. If they are not being suppressed properly they are called frontal release signs . /ringbutton3Primitive reflexes are actually caused due to extra pyramidal functions , many of which are already present at birth. They are lost as the pyramidal tract gain functionality with progressive myelination /ringbutton3Rooting reflex- excellent indicator of general central nervous system function. /ringbutton3Examiner's finger strokes above the ramus of the mandible from the zygoma towards the mouth. The infant should respond with a movement of the mouth towards the finger. /ringbutton3This reflex is present immediately after birth and usually disappears by the third to fourth month. /ringbutton3Considered to be the most critical of neonatal neurologic tests. Can provide comprehensive insight into the infants neurological status. /ringbutton3Examiner supports infant in supine position with both hands. The examiner then \"drops\" the infant downwards. /ringbutton3Looking for symmetrical extension and full abduction of the arms bilaterally with extension of the trunk and flexion of knees and hips. /ringbutton3This will be followed shortly by adduction of the arms into an \"embrace\" position. /ringbutton3Lack of upper extremity response may indicate hemiparesis or injury to brachial plexus. /ringbutton3Inappropriate response to may dislocation. /ringbutton3Neck righting reflex- having infant supine, rotate head to one side. The reaction should be ipsilateral rotation of the trunk. This is displayed at 8-10 months of age /ringbutton3Palmer Grasp- Examiner places a finger into the palm of the neonate's hand. The infant should respond by tightly curling the fingers and thumb around the examiners finger /ringbutton3To evoke the Babinski reflex, the sole of the foot between the heel and the toe is firmly stroked with a hard tool or a thumb. In infants, this could cause the big toe to extend, pushing outwards, and often the small toes will accompany it in a splaying motion. /ringbutton3Infants demonstrate the reflex because their brains are not fully mature, so the protections which prevent this reflex are not yet present. /ringbutton3Present until 2 years old. /ringbutton3Digital Response- The baby's forearm is stroked over the ulnar nerve distribution from proximal to distal towards the hand. /ringbutton3The anticipated response is a fist-like curling of the hand with slight extension of the thumb. This response is from birth to 6 months. /ringbutton3Baby should be able to grasp objects by 5 months. /ringbutton3Infant is held in upright position supported by examiners hands around the torso. /ringbutton3The dorsum of one foot is then lightly rubbed on the underside of a surface. /ringbutton3The infant should flex the knee and bring the foot up onto the surface. /ringbutton3This is followed by the other foot replicating the response. /ringbutton3Inadequate response may suggest paresis or hip dislocation. /ringbutton3Infant is laying supine, bilateral flexion of both thighs. /ringbutton3Then examine joints unilaterally. Flex knee and slowly abduct thigh. /ringbutton3Any clunking sounds or \"slipping feeling\" /ringbutton3Assessing for spinal cord lesion. /ringbutton3Infant is held in prone position, securely supported underneath abdomen by examiners hand. /ringbutton3Unilaterally stroke the paraspinal musculature from the cervical region to the iliac crest. /ringbutton3Anticipated response is extension and lateral flexion of the head and trunk towards same side as stimulus /ringbutton3Characterized most commonly by unilateral spasm of sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM). /ringbutton3Usually recognized by child stuck in muscle spasm with head tilted to one side. /ringbutton3Many different subluxations may cause torticollis. /ringbutton3Rotatory subluxation of C1-C2. /ringbutton3Etiology factors may include in-utero or birth trauma. The use of forceps, vacuum extraction or extreme force and rotation during the delivery. /ringbutton3The child in the next picture presented with facial hemiplegia and torticollis. /ringbutton3Adjustments consisted of Activator C1 on the right. Anterior Superior Occiput using baby toggle piece. /ringbutton3You can see the dramatic resolution in facial hemiplegia and torticollis in a 4 week span. This patient was adjusted 2x a week for the first 2 weeks and 1x a week for last 2 weeks. /ringbutton3Inflammation of the middle ear /ringbutton3-by 2 yo, 33% have had 3 or more episodes 66% have had a least 1. /ringbutton3Medical Treatment /ringbutton3Antibiotics, /ringbutton3Upper Cervical Subluxation /ringbutton3Affecting the superior sympathetic ganglion /ringbutton3Interference of motor nerve fibers from C1- C4 /ringbutton3Inappropriate blockage of Eustachian tube. bronchial tubes and their mucous membranes.

Trouble with expiration e. Subluxation associated with parasympathetic nervous system C0-C5 and sacrum /ringbutton3. Autism currently affects 1 in every 91 children today. It is estimated there are over 1 million people in the United States alone with autism. Autism is the most common developmental disability in California (and many other states). Autism is now more common that Down Syndrome, Mental Retardation, and Cystic Fibrosis combined /ringbutton3Receptive Response 12-18 mos. Points to body parts(eyes, nose mouth) understands up to 50 words, recognizes common objects by name(dog,cat, ball, book) Follows 1 step commands (\"hug your bear\", \"give me the doll\") 18mos-2yo me\" \"on\", \"under\". Begins to distinguish \"you\" from \"Me\" 30 months Follows 2 step commands, can identify objects by use. 3 yrs Knows several colors, knows what we do when we when are hungry, thirsty or sleepy. Is aware of past and future, understands \"today and \"not today\". /ringbutton3Expression Response /ringbutton3Uses words to express needs learns 20-50 words by 18 months, uses words inconsistently and echolalia. /ringbutton3Uses telegraphic of 2 \u00bd words, adjectives and adverbs appear, begins to ask questions. /ringbutton3Uses pronouns and plurals, can tell stories that begin to be understood; uses negatives (I can't, I won't) can tell full name, age and sex. For 3-4 word sentences. /ringbutton3Early warning signs (by 18 months) /ringbutton3Respond to name? /ringbutton3Points to things of interest? /ringbutton3Follow pointing gesture? /ringbutton3Failure to use language in communication /ringbutton3Abnormal development of social reciprocity /ringbutton3Desire for sameness as expressed in repetitive rituals /ringbutton3Autism undoubtedly has a multi-factorial causation profile. /ringbutton3Genetic infections, impaired /ringbutton3Family History- autoimmune, allergies, GI issues /ringbutton3Prenatal history- health and diet, amalgams, vaccines, medications. /ringbutton3Neonatal history- breastfeeding, colic, reflux, sleep issues, trauma, vaccines, medications. /ringbutton3Environment- water, ticks, mold abdomen- be gluten intolerance /ringbutton3Strategies to put pressure on abdomen- gut pain /ringbutton3Hands in pants (scratching)- can be yeast issue /ringbutton3Frequent antibiotics = abnormal flora /ringbutton3Yeast- rash/peeling feet, ridged discolored nails. /ringbutton3Eczema- can be from food allergies Zinc Deficiency- Acne/sparse hair/psoriasis White spots/lines on nails Canker Acid Deficiency- Dry, coarse hair Magnesium deficiency- Muscle twitch Sighing Salt craving /ringbutton3IgG Food Allergy Panel ( important not to get IgE food panel which is what majority of medical doctors and allergists order). This will only show immediate food allergies. Most children on the autism spectrum have delayed food allergy reactions. Specifically to gluten and casein. /ringbutton3Gluten- found in wheat, rye, oats. Remember \"wheat free\" does not always mean gluten free. Also, \"no gluten ingredients\" does not always Allergy-Air /ringbutton3Alcat Labs- food allergy, food additives, food colorings, chemicals, herbs. Gluten containing products other than bread and pasta are : soy sauce, ice cream, many over the counter medicines in tablet form, some miso paste and some sushi rice. Casein - found in all dairy products. Many parents ask me if organic milk is okay. No, this still contains casein. \"Dairy free\" does not mean casein free. Always look for casein as an ingredient. Rice milk and almond milk are good substitutes. I usually don't recommend soy milk. 50%-60% of children that cant tolerate dairy, also cant tolerate soy. /ringbutton3For food allergy testing, I use Immuno Labs. Here are few labs: /ringbutton3IMMUNO your /ringbutton3The Official GFCF Diet Web Site Analysis- check metals. /ringbutton3Replenish - replenish gut with probiotics, replenish body with deficient supplement. /ringbutton3Repair - let the body heal! Repair gut, brain, nervous system /ringbutton3Find and fix subluxations! /ringbutton3Persistent toe walking- check cranial sacral adjustments, parasympathetic nervous system. Aguilar carried out a series of chiropractic adjust ments on 26 autistic children over a 9-month period. Twelve wer e found to have a left atlas laterality and 14 had a right atlas laterality. Outcomes from the study were varied but included normalization of deep tendon reflexes and dermatoma l subjective sensation, increased cervical range of m otion and reduction of other health problems. Many of the chi ldren were taken off Ritalin, bladder and bowel control i mproved, some children started to speak and eye contact and attention span also improved in some children. Hyperactivity and aggressive behavior were reduced in other children and five children were able to attend mainstream classes at school for the first time. Behavioral data, recorded by the te achers and parents, showed significant improvements in mos t cases. Autism is a severe behavioral and neurological diso rder involving or inappropriate use of language, bizarre behaviors an d an insistence on sameness. A systematic series of chiropractic adjus tments was administered to six autistic children to see if beh avioral or neurological remediations would occur concomitant t o treatment. The subjects were recruited from a Kansas City area specialized facility. Data used for the study were collected by the classroom teachers. Those behaviors that remained fairly cons tant prior to treatment were selected for analysis. Results were divided into observable effects and no observable effects. All o f the observable effects that occurred following intervention were i n the desired direction. Behavioral improvements were observed in such diverse areas as picking up toys, use of sign language, red uction of self- abuse and appropriate use of language. It is hoped that this pilot study will generate further research into the effec ts of chiropractic adjustments on similar neurological disorders Country #Vaccines Autism Rate Mortality Rank United States 36 1 in 150 34 Australia 27 1 in 200 16 Canada 26 1 in 165 20 Iceland 11 1 in 1,100 1 Sweden 11 1 in 862 2 Japan 11 1 in 475 4 Norway 13 1 in 2,000 5 Finland 12 1 in 719 6 France 17 1 in 613 11 Israel 11 1 in 1,000 17 Denmark 12 1 in 2,200 18 www.rescuepost.com/files/gr- autism_and_vaccines_world_special_report1.pdf /circle5Am I or my child sick right now? /circle5Have I or my child had a bad reaction to a vaccinat ion before? /circle5Do I or my child have a personal or family history of vaccine reactions, neurological disorders, severe allergies or immune system problems? /circle5Do I know the disease and vaccine risks for myself or my child? /circle5Do I have full information about the vaccine's side effects? /circle5Do I know how to identify and report a vaccine reaction? /circle5Do I know I need to keep a written record, includin g the vaccine manufacturer's name and lot number, for all vaccinations? /circle5Do I know I have the right to make an informed choi ce? /ringbutton3If you answered yes to questions 1, 2, and 3, or no to questions 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 and do not understand the significanc e of your answer, you may want to review information on NVIC' s website with links to other websites and resources so you c an better answer these questions designed to educate consumer s about the importance of making fully informed vaccine decisio ns.
