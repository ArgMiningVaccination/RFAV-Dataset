An Afternoon of Inner Peace... Join Acupuncturist Leah Lubin and Yoga & Meditation Teacher Willow Marcotte for a nourishing afternoon combining the healing energies of Acupuncture and Guided Meditation. This class will invite your mind to slow down while settling the body to promote deep relaxation and complete body healing. Acupuncture harmonizes the whole body-mind through its effects on the central nervous system, releasing chemicals to stimulate the body's natural healing abilities and promote physical and emotional well-being. Acupuncture induces a relaxing and meditative state of mind. Guided Meditation is a way to transform the mind by encouraging a sense of calmness through focused awareness invoked by another. Meditation practices can increase concentration, emotional positivity and clarity, giving the ability to see the true nature of things around us. Blending these two modalities creates a perfect environment for a greater sense of peace within, fostering a harmonious mind, body, and spirit connection. Please remember to bring your mat, blanket, pillow, socks, sweater etc. anything that would allow you to be more comfortable. Space is Limited. $30 in advance Date & Time August 27, 2023 4:00PM - 5:15PM Location [Sun Yoga Tampa Tampa](/businesses/fl-lutz-sun-yoga-tampa) Share "}
