Topics include ACE ( Adverse Childhood Experience ) score \u2014 a metric that represents the amount of toxic stress endured during childhood ; PEARR (provide privacy, education, ask, respect and respond) Tool \u2014 an effective, evidence -based and trauma -informed assessment for human trafficking , domestic violence and related violence; Neurobiology of Trauma ; Vicarious Trauma ; and Trauma - Informed Principles . The series addresses TIC, a gap in addressing human trafficking, which is vital to supporting patients who have been trafficked as well as the SDOH that contribute to human trafficking and similar exploitation, including p oor health outcomes. An evidence -based and trauma -informed assessment like the PEARR Tool is more effective than screening. A trauma -informed assessment using the PEARR Tool facilitates discussions between patients and clinicians about personal safety , and hand offs to social work ers should be done with consent and transparency to avoid stigmatizing patients. TIC is a best practice to help patients feel safe requesting help, even if they do not request help to exit the ir situation. Since disclosure is not the goal, patients do not feel manipulated and are more likely to seek medical attention as needed.
