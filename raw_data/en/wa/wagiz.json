Both trees are an important part of the aboriginal First Nation history in British Columbia, Canada. In 2015, do-TERRA introduced Arborviate (Thuja plicata) as a single oil and the recently reformulated do-TERRA TerraShield\u00ae Outdoor Blend introduced earlier this year, both Arborvitae and Nootka essential oils are featured as key oil ingredients. A Unique Facility For years, brokers have mostly managed the distilleries that remain in Bulgaria, which means they determined how much and when the farmers would get paid. Many farmers are not paid what they should be, and some are not paid for months or even years until the brokers have sold the oil. What makes the Esseterre distillery unique is an on-site, state- of-the-art laboratory, including a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) machine and a lounge where farmers can watch and wait while their crops are being distilled. \"Having this technology on-site at the distillery allows us to not only confirm, while the farmer waits, that their plants produced the highest-quality oil, but also to pay farmers fairly and timely\u2014in this case the same day or the next day,\" explains Tim Valentin-er, Director of Strategic Sourcing. \"We also are enabled to reward bonuses to farmers that are doing the best work and growing plants that result in the highest quality oil. No other distillery in Bulgaria has this capa-bility or priority like we do.\" Co--Impact Sourcing\u00ae Rebuilding Bulgaria At one time in Bulgaria, you would have driven through the Dobrich area and found an area bustling with industry. In fact, before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Bulgaria was a key industrial area for the Soviets and also home to some of the world's most preeminent essential oil research, development, and production. But today, as you pass empty factory after empty factory in many areas of Bulgaria, you quickly realize that Bulgaria's past is not reflected in the present. This is not for lack of expertise in the country or lack of ideal farming conditions for many aromatic plants. The sandy soil and climate all contribute to a land that is rich in potential. Seasoned experts are also skilled in the art of farming and distilling some of the world's highest quality essential oils. To this day, the country remains an agricultural haven for growing a variety of aromatic plants, among them lavender, melissa, chamomile, and yarrow. However, without the support of the state to back essential oil farming, many Bulgarian farmers have abandoned essential oils to grow crops like wheat and corn, which are the focus of government funding and vast European Union subsidies. Knowing the history of essential oils in Bulgaria, do-TERRA chose the Black Sea Town of Varna with a production center in nearby Dobrich as the location for new world-class headquarters. This new do-TERRA-owned farming and distillation company called Esseterre is helping begin a new chapter for the country. Other exciting developments have taken place at the distillery since completion just a few months ago. Not only was it ready for this year's lavender harvest in record time, but it has already had an impact on small-scale farmers. Before the distillery even had a chance to officially open, a melissa farmer came to Esseterre in a panic. He had taken his crop to be distilled at a different distillery nearby, but they had been unable to get a single drop of oil from it. Knowing that there was a new distillery with state-of-the-art equipment, he talked to the management team at Esseterre and begged them to do some-thing. While they had not yet distilled any oil, the team fired 4 / FALL 2016 LIVING MAGAZINEup the boilers for an initial test run and were able to obtain a good quantity of oil from his crop. Emily Wright says, \"The oil they got was just beautiful. The farmer started crying from both excitement and relief. This story just shows the sophistication of our equipment, and also of our team there.\" Under Special Management Part of the secret to Esseterre's success is the management team behind it. Determined that the distillery needed to be managed and operated by local Bulgarians, the team was care- fully selected. Emily Wright explains, \"We want to benefit the people and their heritage and help continue their legacy. The management there come from families that have farmed or dis- tilled essential oils for generations. That legacy was dying, and now they get the chance to bring their heritage back to life.\" Expert managers, distillers, farmers, and engineers make up the team. Along with impeccable industry-related skills, the Esseterre team, led by General Manager Plamen Nikolov, is characterized by a shared commitment and common vision to positively impact their own communities and the well-being of small-scale farmers Esseterre is partnering with in Bulgaria.Currently, the distillery directly employs 17 full-time staff. In addition, Esseterre employs upwards of 50 seasonal employees, not counting the hundreds of farmers and others that Esseterre will indirectly employ. There are also many more who are eager to join forces with Esseterre's mission and the doTERRA Co-Impact Sourcing \u00ae approach. The Future of do-TERRA Esseterre is primarily focusing this first season on Lavender and Melissa oil production, but farmers are capable and anxious to do even more. The distillery is planning to operate at least 200 days per year in order to facilitate a more efficient and optimal use of Bulgaria's abundant, high-quality aromatic plants. Among the crops that Esseterre will distill during the lavender and melissa off-seasons are blue chamo-mile, yarrow, fennel, coriander seed, juniper berry, and others. Esseterre has also established relationships with other farmers and distillation partners nearby for expanded capacity as needed. Corey Lindley says, \"Esseterre is a model farming and distilling operation we are very proud of, not only for its top-notch operations, but also for the way in which our Co-Impact Sourcing model is able to bring meaningful impact and opportunity to a part of the world that desperately needs it. This is how we will continue to ensure our supply chain and also ensure we continue to have access to the highest quality essential oils.\" While the concept of investing in Bulgaria has been in the works for more than one and a half years, actual construction for the distillery was completed in only five months, between February and June 2016. The Esseterre distillery is among the largest in the country, housing 12 distillation units (soon to be 14 units later this year). doterra.com / 5Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Bulgaria has fallen on hard times. Nearly a quarter of its citizens are living at or below the poverty line and the country is currently experiencing one of the most extreme population declines in the world. This is mostly caused by a mass migration away from the country due to a lack of job opportunities and a decaying economy. One demographic that is particularly suffering from this decline in both population and opportunity is the disproportionate number of orphans in Bulgaria. Sadly, the needs in Bulgaria far outweigh the resources that are available in vastly underfunded state-run orphanage institutions. Once these children reach the legal age of 18, they can no longer stay at these institutions and are forced to leave. \"They are basically thrown out into society and they fail,\" says Emily Wright, Founding Executive and Vice President of Marketing and Sales at dTERRA. \"They end up homeless. They don't have social development skills, trade skills, or any of the things they need to allow them to succeed.\" T o help these youth, the dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation has partnered with a local Bulgarian nonprofit organization known as The Social T eahouse. This organization opens its door to youth between the ages of 14 and 18 to help them prepare to leave state-run institutions through offering a three-year mentorship program that builds professional and personal skills. and the dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation in Bulgaria 6 / FALL 2016 LIVING MAGAZINEThese youth are also given access to internships, networking, and job opportunities that provide them with more access to the labor market. The goal is to prepare them to be able to develop careers, sustainable futures, and social integration when they enter society on their own. By learning the skills and competences needed, The Social T eahouse seeks to create a bridge to success between a child's time in the orphanages and their life after. Earlier this year, the dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation contributed a substantial donation to assist The Social T eahouse in completing the refurbishment and outfitting of their new head office, training facility, and operating teahouse. At this teahouse, the orphans are able to learn hands-on food preparation, catering, and business skills. The revenue they earn helps to cover costs for the training and mentoring initiatives of The Social T eahouse curriculum. The interns will also learn skills linked to vegetable gardening, larger-scale farming, and distilling operations, in partnership with Esseterre, dTERRA's new farming and distilling operation in Bulgaria. The hope is to ultimately increase public awareness, create positive social engagement, and facilitate the opportunities that are much needed to alleviate the difficult transition that exists for far too many Bulgarian youth. and the dTERRA Healing Hands Foundation in Bulgaria doterra.com / 7DR. DAVID K. HILL, DC Executive Vice President, Chief Medical Officer/Chairman, Scientific Advisory Committee Why is the quality of essential oils so important? What is the best way to use dTERRA Touch\u00ae Blends? What are the benefits of adding Lemon essential oil in water vs. fresh lemon juice? LEMON TIPS:As essential oils are becoming more mainstream, this question becomes even more paramount. There is a finite supply of essential oils on the planet, far less in fact than the consumer demand. What this means is that many products out there are impure or even synthetic. The chemistry of an essential oil is greatly determined by its purity and harvesting location and methods, and a wide variety of contaminants or irregular chemistries can find their way into essential oils if they're never tested for purity. As a result, an oil may not offer its intended benefits, and may even pose unknown risk. The best essential oils are pure, all-natural, and have known chemical compositions. The dTERRA Touch line was developed with ease of use and ultimate safety in mind. The primary issue I hear from novice essential oil users is that they don't know how to apply them. The dTERRA Touch blends are revolutionary in that they take the guessing game out of topical application. They are ideal for everybody, regardless of age or experience, because with precise pre-dilution you simply remove the cap and roll it on. Keep the dTERRA Breathe \u00ae roll-on in your bedroom nightstand for a clearing, refreshing aroma, or keep a Lavender roll-on in your medicine cabinet to soothe minor skin irritations, or leave a Peppermint roll-on in your child's backpack so they can apply it to their temples for an energy boost throughout the day. The dTERRA wTouch blends are the ideal grab-and-go essential oils and perfect for children and individuals with sensitive skin. Lemon essential oil is cold-pressed from the rind while lemon juice comes from the pulp, resulting in two very dissimilar substances with unrelated properties. Chemically, Lemon essential oil is very high in limonene, much more so than lemon juice. In particular, the high concentration of limonene is why Lemon essential oils is so cleansing and can aid in digestive and respiratory function when consumed. Essential oils are also highly concentrated; even if the substances were identical in makeup, it would take a large amount of fresh lemon juice to match the potency of two drops of Lemon essential oil in water. Finally, Lemon essential oil may also be easier to ingest for those with sensitive stomachs because it does not contain citric acid, the component of lemon juice that makes it sour. Add 1-2 drops to glass of water in the morning to rejuvenate and cleanse your body. Add a couple drops to tea for an invigorating citrus flavor. Add 1-2 drops to spoonful of raw honey; eat by itself or mix in warm water.

At the time, he was working long hours trying to support a family while also attending graduate school. He says, \"Life's demands have resorted my wife, three pre-school age children, and myself to eating on-the-go frequently.\" Poor lifestyle choices eventually took a toll on Joe's overall health, making it very difficult for him to accomplish his daily responsibilities. Due to lack of physical activity, excess weight, and weak core muscles, Joe developed lower back and neck pain. The pain made working out less desirable, and fatigue gave him an excuse not to change. But, he realized that he needed to push all the excuses out of the way and start making some serious lifestyle changes. Journey to a Better LifestyleOvercoming Challenges Having three young children and getting to the gym is tough, so I found a local gym with child care. There are days when I don't have time to exercise, so when that happens, I give myself a pass and plan for the next morning. Lifestyle is a journey of planning. Whatever you do, avoid criticizing yourself for missing a workout when time is not in your control. Y ou can always stay accountable by asking a friend to meet you for workout or a walk. Placing Value on Health Exercise has been vital to my transformation. I have found the morning to be the best time for exercise, so I set a specific time to go to the gym, and I make it a priority. It became my outlet for reducing daily stress. I also made sure I was getting at least seven hours of sleep so I could have the energy to exercise the next day. Adequate sleep will bring mental clarity during workouts and when selecting food choices.Since I started the challenge, I've identified my eating triggers and really placed value on my health. Using dTERRA products in my lifestyle change has made a remarkable improvement in my overall wellbeing.* It is incredible the improvement I feel with balancing family, work, and graduate school. I feel more energy keeping up with my three preschool-age children! My concentration and focus with the graduate studies are at an all-time high. Incorporating dTERRA Products Each day I started with water and the Slim & Sassy \u00ae Metabolic Blend for a morning boost.* I used the T erraGreens\u00ae mix after a workout and changed my eating habits for healthy portions of lean meats, vegetables, and fruits. I reduced excess sugar and processed foods and focused on eating higher fiber foods. Each day I take the dTERRA Lifelong Vitality Pack \u00ae supplements to support my daily intake of antioxidants.* I incorporated the Slim & Sassy \u00ae Trim-Shake for a low-calorie evening snack. Exceeding Expectations In the end, I exceeded my weight loss goal by 10 pounds, and more importantly, I have implemented a healthier lifestyle for myself and my family. I have dropped far more inches than expected, and I am under my waist size goal by three inches. With the change in body fat and improved posture, I am feeling healthy and energized, and I no longer get up struggling with neck and back pain. A primary goal was to change my family's nutritional habits. The new lifestyle has allowed me to set an example of healthy eating, and I cook more for my family! My wife and I are incorporating enjoyable physical activity in our own quality time. Being active has helped me keep and have fun running and dancing with my children. The lifestyle change has motivated many around me to begin their weight loss journey. I often get asked how I lost weight, and I am happy to share this experience with them.

The logical response is to ramp up the workout intensity or volume and cut out those last few calories, but the most effective measure may be to do nothing at all. Sleep is one of the most important factors in maintaining optimal metabolism, supporting normal endocrine function, and regulating appetite. If you are serious about your body, optimum health doesn't always begin in the gym or the kitchen, but often between the sheets. SLEEP EFFECTS Exercise and Weight Management 12 / FALL 2016 LIVING MAGAZINE Sleep requirements change over the course of an individual's life; therefore, guidelines are primarily based on one's age. The National Sleep Foundation recommends up to 17 hours per day for newborns, and down to 6-8 for older adults. Advocates increased sleep time for those with particularly active lifestyles. There are also a series of sleep hygiene recommendations that can help you get the most out of your bedtime. The latest guidelines suggest not napping during the day to maintain normal patterns, avoiding stimulants later in the day, and establishing a consistent bedtime routine. One of the most important factors to keep in mind is that experts almost universally agree that attempting to \"catch up\" on sleep is a losing proposition. Even if you may initially feel more rested, following sleep deprivation with longer bouts of sleeping ultimately affects your circadian rhythms and may make it more difficult to set a consistent regimen. Like healthy eating and exercise, the effectiveness of sleep is highly dependent on consistency. Lack of sleep can have significant metabolic and endocrine effects that may reduce or even completely undo the success of your weight management efforts. Cortisol, the \"stress hormone\" secreted during times when the \"fight or flight\" response mechanism is initiated, is proving to be one of the most important factors in both fat loss and lean muscle tissue gain. In fact, one recent study found that participants on a professionally designed diet and exercise program found it impossible to lose weight when not reaching sleep recommendations 1. Cortisol levels influence body composition by inhibiting the processing of amino acids, obstructing growth hormone release, altering the proper regulation of blood sugar levels, and even making it more difficult to stick to diets. 2 A 2010 study found that those functioning on less than optimal levels of sleep had higher levels of cortisol throughout the day, and subsequently had less success in their weight management efforts.3 If you are experiencing an otherwise unexplainable uptick on the scale, it may be time to reevaluate your sleeping patterns. Recent research suggests that sleep deprivation may also sabotage your dieting efforts. Sleeping less than six hours has been shown to increase hunger, increase cravings for sweets, and ultimately may lead to weight gain. 4,5 Sleep- deprived individuals often exhibit several endocrine irregularities directly associated with appetite and weight regulation. Lack of sleep can increase the secretion of ghrelin, \"the hunger hormone,\" which regulates satiety and reward perception accompanying specific foods. Sleep deprivation appears to increase caloric consumption through two separate mechanisms, by increasing the sensitivity of the brain's reward system for ingesting energy-dense foods and encouraging one to eat more in response to the extra energy expended while staying up as opposed to sleeping. If you are having difficulty sticking to your healthy diet goals, the culprit may be your sleeping patterns. The amount and quality of sleep also may impact your workout performance. One recent study found that short-term sleep deprivation resulted in significantly decreased strength, power, and cardiovascular performance. 6 After only a single night of less than adequate sleep, study participants exhibited characteristics similar to those suffering from overtraining, and the effects seemed to increase over time. Another study found that disturbed sleep patterns adversely affect cognitive function and reaction time, which can increase exercise accident risk. 7 Furthermore, lack of sleep has been shown to be detrimental to exercise recovery, meaning you may need to exercise less and expend more effort on proactive recovery techniques to continue progressing and remain injury free.8 If you don't feel like working out today or notice your intensity and performance waning, the first step should not be toward a stimulant, but your bed. Progressing toward your fitness goals requires a lot of dedication, hard work, and even more rest. One of the most researched benefits of essential oils are their calming and relaxing properties. Including essential oils in your bedtime routine may be the extra push you need. A few drops of Lavender on your bedsheets and diffusing your favorite calming and grounding blend as you prepare for rest will create the calming sleep environment your body requires for recovery.

Petitgrain essential oil is derived from the bitter orange tree originally from the Southern region of China; however, in the early 18th century, Spanish Jesuits brought it to Paraguay where it thrives and now grows wild.

They use dTERRA On Guard\u00ae Foaming Hand Wash in preschool bathrooms and dTERRA On Guard Cleaner Concentrate to clean tables and desks. Principal Torrence Jackson says, \"Princi-pals all over America know that safety is a number one concern in our schools. Thanks to the help of dTERRA, our students can successfully learn in an environment that is pro-active about health and wellness.\" Most of the faculty members personally use dTERRA essential oils at home. \"I've seen such an incredible change in my own family's immunity, focus, and overall health,\" says Jess Johnson. And Principal Jackson adds, \"It is not an easy feat keeping up with the next generation of leaders! I am thankful to have a restful night's sleep with dTERRA Lavender oil.\" Jenni Smith, the Preschool Director, was intro-duced to dTERRA over two years ago. After using dTERRA On Guard in her home, Jenni became a believer. She has been instrumental in introducing oils to the school. Because of her trust in the products at home, it was easy to implement them at school. She says, \"One parent said after touring the school that it sealed the deal for her when she saw the dTERRA diffuser!\" Shelly Martinez, preschool teacher and parent, uses dTERRA On Guard and Wild Orange in her classroom every day to cleanse the air of \"unpre-dictable\" smells. She feels it also helps the kids stay focused. Stacie Groves, third grade teacher and mom, diffuses Lime and dTERRA On Guard daily in her classroom. \"I let the kids take turns picking out oils and putting them in the diffuser themselves. They love it and ask for it daily.\" Whether at a public school or homeschool, essential oils can have numerous benefits for kids as well as teachers. Jessa Johnson is a dTERRA Wellness Advocate and a mother of two. Both of her boys have been attending the Castle Rock Christian Academy in Colorado since 2012. In 2014, shortly after joining dTERRA, Jessa donated \"clean hands spray\" and diffusers with a bottle of dTERRA On Guard\u00ae to every classroom and teacher. After noticing positive results, a majority of the class - rooms at Castle Rock are now diffusing essential oils daily. One of the main differences they've noticed is the reduced number of absences for students and teachers. Out of 19 teachers, less than 14 leave days were used during the 2015/2016 schoolyear\u2014less than half the days used in prior years. 16 / FALL 2016 LIVING MAGAZINECleansing: dTERRA On Guard Protective Blend, and PurifyConcentration and Focus: Rosemary, Peppermint Energizing: Wild Orange, Lemon, Lime, Grapefruit Calming: Lavender, Spikenard, Bergamot Best Essential Oils for Classrooms doterra.com / 17Preparing healthy meals based on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins (like beans, nuts, seeds, fish, and poultry), while avoiding over-processed, nutrient-poor foods, can help establish good nutritional habits in your child that can last a lifetime. one-third of children and adolescents consume fast food daily. Growing bodies can benefit from supplementation too! Jeff Dorsett, MSHS; dTERRA Research ScientistNutritionally Inadequate: WHAT'S A PARENT TO DO? As parents, one of the most important things that we can do for our children is setting an example through our good nutritional habits. As the old adage goes, \"The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\" 18 / FALL 2016 LIVING MAGAZINEUnfortunately, even the best efforts to prepare a balanced diet often fall short in providing the recommended levels of nutrients. Many children do not meet daily recommendations for several nutrients including vitamins A, C, E, and K and calcium and magnesium. Similar deficiencies are found for health-promoting nutrients without official recommended daily intakes, like omega-3 fatty acids (particularly DHA), and probiotics. For a variety of reasons, most kids simply do not consume these important nutrients on a regular basis. This is where supplementation can really help bridge nutritional gaps in a child's diet, without adding significant calories. Our children aren't just little adults. They don't act or function the way adults do (anyone who has had a 3-year-old can attest to that!). But more importantly, their young bodies are still growing; their metabolisms and nutritional demands are different than those of an adult. Furthermore, excessive amounts of certain nutrients (such as iron) can be toxic in children. Children may have unique nutritional needs, so working closely with your child's pediatrician can help too. All of these factors should be considered before giving a child a supplement. One way to address many of these needs is a daily multivitamin supplement specifically formulated for children. Unfortunately, many leading children's supplements deliver cheap, poorly absorbed forms of vitamins and minerals, and are often formulated with undesirable artificial colors, sweeteners, and/ or flavors. dTERRA a2z Chewable tablets are a great tasting, concentrated source of your child's daily vitamins and minerals. Each serving delivers a balanced blend of B vitamins and is an excellent source of vitamins A, C, D, E, and K. This unique formula also delivers a comprehensive blend of botanical powders and extracts along with brain and nervous system supporting nutrients, to help support the nutritional needs of growing bodies.* dTERRA a2z Chewable is a delicious and easy way to ensure that your kids get the nutrients they need from high quality sources without the artificial colors, flavors, and sweeteners so abundant in other children's vitamins. Probiotics For Healthy Tummies These days, it seems as though everyone is talking about probiotics and how they help maintain the health of the digestive and immune systems. Y ogurt is a source of probiotics that most children enjoy. However, brands have a lot of added sugar and typically only deliver relatively small amounts of a single probiotic strain. In addition, some kids may be allergic to dairy. One of dTERRA's most recent dietary supplement offerings helps address the nutritional need for probiotics without the dairy, sugar, or unfamiliar taste of fermented foods. PB Assist\u00ae Jr is a powdered probiotic supplement designed with children in mind.

Arguably, there are no more important nutrients for the healthy growth and function of the brain and nervous system than omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). In fact, 60 percent of the brain is structural fat and DHA, which makes up more than 30 percent of gray matter (the information processing center of the brain). This gray matter structure is extremely important for signal transmissions in the brain, eyes, and nervous system. Unfortunately, the richest source of omega-3 fatty acids are often some of the most avoided by children: fish and seafood. For kids who have distaste for fish and seafood, dTERRA IQ Mega\u00ae provides a great way to get the important benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, without the \"fishy\" taste so typical of other fish oil supplements. IQ Mega combines the fresh orange flavor of Wild Orange essential oil with 1,000 mg of concentrated omega-3 fatty acids (including 400 mg of brain supportive DHA), without concerns about mercury, contaminants, or fishy aftertaste. It can be taken straight by the teaspoonful, blended into fruit and vegetable smoothies, or added to other healthy beverages or foods. Supplementation It Just Makes Sense As parents, it is important that we set good nutritional examples. We all know the importance of eating healthy, well-balanced meals. But it is often difficult to put anything on the dinner table, let alone making sure that every meal is nutritionally sound. This is why supplementation just simply makes sense. Of course, getting nutrients from a healthy, well-balanced diet should continue to be strived for. But the reality is that most children simply do not eat as well as they should. Supplementation offers an affordable and convenient way to fill nutrient gaps. Great tasting, convenient, easy-to-use supplements like dTERRA a2z Chewable, IQ Mega, and PB Assist Jr help to fill these gaps and promote a foundation for lifelong health and vitality.

Beta-carotene: The best-known nutrient in orange foods is beta carotene, a powerful antioxidant that gives sunny fruits and vegetables their brilliant color. Experts say beta-carotene is not only good for eye health, it can also delay cognitive aging and protect skin from sun damage. Vitamin A: Beta carotene is a precursor for vitamin A, which is commonly referred to as retinal, reti- nol, and retonoic acid. Vitamin A is important for night vision, as an antioxidant that can neutralize the damaging free radicals in the body, and as a crucial part of the health of your immune system. Vitamin C: Orange foods are full of vitamin C, an antioxidant that boosts the immune system, protects against cardiovascular disease, and helps rebuild collagen in the skin.

She had owned a daycare for 25 years in the city when her husband accepted a position as a full-time pastor in a little country church. They now love the country life and all that comes with it, including their chickens, goats, sheep, cats, pigs, and one grand dog. In December of 2013, not long after their move, Kimberly met Micki Brogery at a flea market. It was Micki's passion that brought Kimberly into dTERRA\u00ae when she brought a bottle of Vetiver essential oil to her home late one evening. That night and that oil sparked Kimberly's own passion, and forever changed her life. Shortly after joining dTERRA, Kimberly completed the AromaTouch Technique training. She says she had never thought about becoming an instructor until she received an AromaTouch Technique kit in the mail from her upline. She says, \"They sent me the kit as a gift when I hit Gold, and a card that said, 'We hope that now you are Gold you will become an AromaTouch Technique instructor.'\" Shortly after receiving the kit, she headed to Georgia to meet Dr. Hill and become a certified instructor. She says, \"It has been two and a half years since my certification and I am so very glad I did it. What an opportunity I have been given to help others be able to give a blessing to someone else. \" \"It has been two and a half years since my certification and I am so very glad I did it.

Kimberly says, \"She was a poor, neglected, sweet baby girl who came to us with just the clothes she had on and a bottle. \"Mercedes is now a 13-year-old with a true servant's heart who isn't afraid of hard work and is always willing to jump in and help others. \"She is truly my right hand girl. I absolutely love the time we spend training others; it's an amazing experience being able to change lives together. We often travel several hours to teach classes and doing that makes my heart happy. Through these trips, we've even gotten to see some firsts together, like Lake Michigan.\" After watching her mom giving the AromaTouch Technique to others and seeing how happy it made them, Mercedes realized that's exactly what she wanted to do\u2014help people and cheer them up. So she asked her mom if she could be trained. She says, \"My mom told me I had to be 18, but I could learn and help her, and that's just what I did!\" Mercedes likes to help her mom by passing her the oils when she is doing the demonstration, or setting up the table. She says, \"There are times when I'm a partner fill in, or I'll be the one that my mom does the demonstrations on when we don't have enough people in the class.\" Kimberly mentions, \"My favorite moment just recently happened when Mercedes and I had the privilege to teach a blind girl the technique. It was rewarding to know that anyone has the ability to learn. I love seeing each person who receives this blessing be changed, physically and mentally, along with the gratitude they have for it.\" In addition to helping others, Kimberly continues to experience the benefits of the AromaTouch Technique in her own family. \"Being able to give my littles the AromaTouch Technique has been a huge blessing. In addition, having the ability to teach my older kids to give the AromaTouch Technique has made me feel immense gratitude. I would say to everyone, get certified!

With the responsibility of protecting your body from illness and disease, your immune system is one of the most important components of your overall health. This complex network of cells, tissues, and organs works together to fight off fungi, bacteria, parasites, and other microbes while maintaining healthy tissue. While we are just beginning to understand how this intricate communication works, modern science has helped us identify lifestyle behaviors that support its proper function. The immune system isn't a single entity, but a collection of structures and processes that protect us against disease or other potentially dangerous foreign bodies. The main components of the immune system are the lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, lymphocytes, thymus, and leuokocytes. Lymph nodes are the bean-shaped structures that store and help transport the cells that fight infection. The spleen contains the white blood cells, assists with blood circulation, and helps dispose of old and damaged cells. Bone marrow, the yellow tissue inside bones, produces white blood cells. The two types of lymphocytes, B and T-cells, are the white blood cells that actually defend the body against bacteria, toxins, and infections. The thymus is the leaf-shaped organ where the T-cells mature. Lastly, leuokocytes are another type of white blood cell, responsible for identifying and eliminating pathogens. We are exposed to countless potentially harmful microbes on a day-to-day basis, when functioning properly, the immune system distinguishes these threats from our healthy tissue and attacks them. Following the healthy lifestyle behaviors outlined by dTERRA's lifestyle wellness pyramid is the first step in supporting optimal immune system function. Supporting Your Immune System Nutrition: While there is no specific food, nutrient, or supplement that has been proven to directly improve the immune system on its own, its function depends on the vitamins and minerals provided by a balanced diet of whole fruits, vegetables, grains, and lean proteins. Malnourishment and micronutrient deficiencies can result in altered immune responses and increased risk for illness. In IMMUNE SYSTEMUNDERSTANDING THE By James Geiger, MD 30 / FALL 2016 LIVING MAGAZINENutrition Healthy Immune System ExERCISE Sleepsupplementsparticular, in vitro studies have demonstrated that deficiencies of minerals zinc, selenium, and iron and vitamins A, B6, C, and E may be correlated with altered immune responses . (1) Supplementing your diet with specific vitamins, minerals, and probiotics may build up and fortify the immune system. (2) Microplex VMz\u00ae food nutrient complex is rich in vitamin D3, which has been shown to support a healthy immune system.(3)* PB Assist\u00ae+ probiotic defense formula contains six strains of microogranisms which support the healthy functioning of the immune system by maintaining balance and proliferation of beneficial bacteria.* Additionally, some essential oils such as Oregano may help maintain a healthy immune system when taken internally.* Add 2-3 drops to a veggie capsule or try dTERRA On Guard\u00ae+ softgels for daily immune support.* Taken daily, along with a healthy balanced diet, these supplements can be your first line of defense in preserving immune system health. Exercise: While recent research has shown that failure to exercise can temporarily decrease healthy immune response and make you more susceptible to illness, exercise contributes to overall health and well-being, subsequently contributing to the maintenance of a healthy immune system. (4) It is believed that regular exercise may also directly promote immune system health by pro moting im proved circulation, allowing the com ponents of the immune system to move freely and do their job more effectively. The natural support of energy production and healthy circulation provided by taking Mito2Max\u00ae energy and stamina complex can help you make physical activity a part of your daily life, contributing to a healthy immune system. Sleep: Both quantity and quality of sleep are important for maintaining a healthy immune system. The effectiveness of rest is dependent on the circadian biological clock, which regulates the timing of periods of sleepiness and wakefulness throughout the day. It is important that we get enough sleep and that we follow a consistent schedule of activity and rest periods. If we are sleep deprived, our T-cells, lymphocytes that play a central role in cell-mediated immunity, decrease the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines. (5) Furthermore, sleep influences the interaction between antigens, any substance that the body must produce antibodies to fight off, and T helper cells such as interleukin-12, in a process known as immunological memory. In one study, researchers found that the length and quality of sleep the previous night affected the production of antigen-specific T-cells in response to a hepatitis A vaccination. (6) With each interruption in your sleep pattern comes a decrease in your body's ability to respond to the intruders it needs to fight off to stay healthy. Put a few drops of Lavender in the diffuser and enjoy its relaxing aroma as you hit the sheets. A peaceful environment can promote a restful night's sleep to keep that immune system ticking. Healthy lifestyle behaviors not only influence how you look and feel, but your body's ability to ward off harmful invaders. Support your immune system by cleaning up that diet, adding some immune-supporting supplements and oils to your daily routine, getting up off the couch, and getting into a consistent sleeping pattern.
