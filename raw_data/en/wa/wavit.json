Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 2/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 5: RATIONALE Protocol MA30005 has been amended with the following: 1. Updates to the safety risks associated with Ocrelizumab Section 5.1 (Safety Plan) was updated in order to include information based on the updated core safety text and interim results of the vaccination study BN29739 (VELOCE), which evaluated the effects of ocrelizumab on the immune response in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. This new information is considered a substantial change because it may impact the safety of the patients. The information pertaining to the risk of 'impaired immunization response' has been updated accordingly in the protocol and has been moved from 'Potential risks' to 'Identified Risks and Adverse Drug Reactions'. The Addendum to Investigators Brochure (IB) v16, dated April 2018, also includes this relevant information, and this amendment aligns the MA30005 protocol with the latest IB. 2. Clarification about the \"Follow -up Period\" for patients switching to commercial drug Text was added to clarify that those patients who decide to leave the study and switch to commercially marketed ocrelizumab, either after completion of the 96 weeks Treatment Period or after early discontinuation of the 96 weeks Treatment Period, will not enter the safety Follow -up Period. 3. Changes in Section 6: STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN Minor changes in the text were applied to clarify the statistical approach and to align with the rest of the ocrelizumab clinical development program. 4. Clarification about the pregnancy and treatment discontinu ation Clarification was added to the study treatment discontinuation rules ( Section 4.6.2): \" in case of pregnancy, treatment should be interrupted, and the patient should be monitored for safety; however, the patient can be re-started with the treatment after the pregnancy and breastfeeding period. During pregnancy and breastfeeding, the patient will continue to come for regular schedule visits as per the protocol and will perform all assessments except MRI \" This does not change the existing requirement f or the patients who become pregnant to discontinue study treatment, but allows the return to the study treatment after the end of pregnancy (independent of the preg nancy outcome). Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 3/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 5. Correction of the frequency of HBV DNA PCR test to 24 weeks instead of 12 weeks For enrolled patients with negative HBsAg and positive total HBcAb, HBV DNA screening (by PCR) must be repeated every 24 weeks. In the previous protocol versions , it was erroneously stated the PCR test must be repeated every 12 weeks. The change to 24 weeks aligns the PCR frequency with the 24 -week -frequency of the clinical visits as per Schedule of Assessment. 6. Inclusion of instructions around the optional use of a Patient Diary Section 4.5.12 and Appendix 7 were included to provide instructions about the use of a Patient Diary and as optional additional tool to help the patient and the site with the collection and reporting of AEs and concomitant medications. 7. Correction of the start of safety follow -up for patients who discontinue study treatment early Throughout the protocol, the change was made to clarify that the p atients who discontinue treatment early will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the Ear ly Treatment Discontinuation Visit , and not after the last infusion of study drug. 8. Correction in the adverse event reporting period Throughout the protocol, the inconsistencies in the adverse event reporting period was corrected from '48 weeks after the last dose of the study drug' to '96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period' to align with the duration of the Safety Follow -up of 96 weeks . Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 4/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 5 : SUMMARY OF CHANGES Substantive new information appears in italics. Deleted text is shown in strike -through mode. PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS The protocol synopsis has been updated to reflect the changes to the proto col, where applicable. 3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY Follow -up Period: Patients who discontinue treatment early will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the Early Treatment Discontinuation Visit last infusion of study drug . Patients who complete the 96 weeks Treatment Period and, in agreement with their treating neurologist, decide not to continue in a separate long -term extension (LTE) study, will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period. Patients who decide to leave the study and switch to commercially marketed Ocrelizumab, either after completion of the 96 weeks Treatment Period or after early discontinuation of the 96 weeks Treatment Period, will not enter the safety Follow -up Period. 3.1.3 Treatment Period Patients who discontinue treatment early will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the Early Treatment Discontinuation Visit last infusion of study drug . Patients who complete the 96 weeks Treatment Period and, in agreement with their treating neurologist, decide not to continue in a separate long term extension ( LTE) study, will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period (see Section 3.1.4 ). Patients who decide to leave the study and switch to commercially marketed Ocrelizumab, either after completion of the 96 weeks Treatment Period or after early discontinuation of the 96 weeks Treatment Period, will not enter the safety Follow -up Period. 3.1.4 Follow -up Period Patients who discontinue treatme nt early will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the Early Treatment Discontinuation Visit last infusion of study drug . Patients who complete the 96 weeks Treatment Period and, in agreement with their treating neurologist, decide not to continue i n a separate long term extension ( LTE) study, will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period. Patients who decide to leave the study and switch to commercially marketed Ocrelizumab, either after completion of the 96 weeks Treatment Period or after early discontinuation of the 96 weeks Treatment Period, will not enter the safety Follow -up Period. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 5/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Any patient whose peripheral blood B -cell count remains depleted after this period will continue to be monitored at 24 -week intervals until the B -cell count has returned to the baseline value or to lower limit of normal (LLN) range, whichever is lower. Figure 4 provid es an overview of the Follow -up Period, which is the variable B -cell monitoring period. A schedule of assessments for the Follow -up Period is presented in Appendix 2 . During the Follow -up Period, patients will be formally ass essed at clinical visits every 24 weeks and by telephone contacts every 8 weeks. If further B -cell monitoring is required and the patient is not receiving any other B -cell targeted therapy, assessm ents will take place at clinical visits every 24 weeks and by telephone contacts every 8 weeks until the B -cells are repleted. See Appendix 2 for further details. After initiation of study drug, all adverse events will be reported until 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period but may be extended in patients whose B -cells take longer to replete. Related SAEs must be collected and reported regardless of the time elapsed from the last study drug administration, even if the study has been closed. Unrelated SAEs must be collected a nd reported during the study through the end of the Safety Follow Up Period, which is at least 96 weeks after the last infusion, but may be extended in patients whose B cells take longer to replete. Non serious adverse events have to be reported until the end of Safety Follow up Period. 4.5.8 Laboratory, Biomarker, and Other Biological Samples Viral serology and detection: For enrolled patients with negative HBsAg and positive total HBcAb, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA (by PCR) must be repeated every 1224 weeks 4.5.12 Patient Diary (optional) Due to the low frequency of study visits (every 6 months) and the structured telephone interviews (every 8 weeks between the study visits), patient diaries are proposed as an additional optional tool to help further improve the collection and documentation of Adverse Events and concomitant medications. The decision to use the patient diary is left to the discretion of each investigator. The investigator must ensure that required EC/IRB approval was obtained before implementing the patient diary at his/her site. Additional instructions around the use of an optional Patient Diary are provided in Appendix 7. 4.6.2 Study Treatment Discontinuation Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 6/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Ongoing pregnancy or breas tfeeding (in case of pregnancy, treatment should be interrupted, and the patient should be monitored for safety; however, the patient can be re - start ed with the treatment after the pregnancy and breastfeeding period. During pregnancy and breastfeeding, the patient will continue to come for the regular schedule visits as per the protocol and will perform all assessments except MRI). 4.6.4 End of study treatment At the end of the study treatment the patients will be encouraged to be included in a separate Long term Extension ( LTE) study to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of their DMT treatment, and this is independent of the DMT. This LTE will also aim to evaluate the relationship between the primary endpoint of this study and long -term outcome. Patients who discontinue treatment early will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the Early Treatment Discontinuation Visit last infusion of study drug . Patients who complete the 96 weeks Treatment Period and, in agreement with their treating neurologist, decide not to continue in a separate long term extension ( LTE) study, will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period. (see Section 3.1.4). Patients who decide to leave the study and switch to commercially marketed Ocrelizumab, either after completion of the 96 weeks Treatment Period o r after early discontinuation of the 96 weeks Treatment Period, will not enter the safety Follow -up Period. Section 5.1 SAFETY PLAN Administration of ocrelizumab will be performed in a hospital, clinic environment or doctor's office/practice under close su pervision of the investigator or a medically qualified staff member with immediate availability of full resuscitation facilities. All adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded during the study and until at 24, and 48 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period last dose of ocrelizumab as provided through this study. 5.1.1.1 Identified Risks and Adverse Drug Reactions Infusion -Related Reactions (IRRs) All CD20 depleting agents administered via the intravenous route, including ocrelizumab have been associated with acute IRRs. Following the approved administration regimen (which includes the use of premedication prior to treatment with ocrelizumab in orde r to reduce frequency and severity of IRRs), Ssymptoms of IRRs may occur during any ocrelizumab infusion but have been more frequently reported during the first infusion. Physicians should alert patients that IRRs can occur within 24 hours of the infusion. Across the RMS and PPMS trials, symptoms associated with IRRs included, but were not limited to: These reactions may present as pruritus, rash, urticaria, erythema, irritation, Ocrelizumab flushing, hypotensi on, pyrexia, fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea and tachycardia. Infections Peripheral B cell depletion is an expected outcome of ocrelizumab use. Beyond the clinical trial experience of patients switching from beta interferon or glatiramer acetate to ocrelizumab, there are limited data on switching patients from other disease modifying therapies. When switching patients from another disease modifying therapy to ocrelizumab, the halflife and mode of action of the other therapy must be consid ered, to take into consideration the potential for overlapping pharmacodynamic effects, whilst at the same time minimising the risk of disease reactivation. In interventional clinical studies Tthere were no reports of hepatitis B reactivation in MS patie nts treated with ocrelizumab, but it had been reported in one RA patient treated with ocrelizumab. For PML see \"Potential risks\" below. Delay ocrelizumab administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. For PML see \"Poten tial risks\" below. Decrease in immunoglobulins Treatment with ocrelizumab resulted in a decrease in total immunoglobulins (Ig) over the controlled period of the studies , mainly driven by reduction in IgM, with no observed association with serious infections during the controlled periods . The proportion of patients with decrease in Igs below LLN increased over time and with successive dosing. Based on additional patient exposure, in cases of continuous decrease over time, a higher risk of serious in fection cannot be ruled out (see below in potential risks section). Impaired Response to Vaccination After treatment with ocrelizumab over 2 years in pivotal clinical trials, the proportion of patients with positive antibody titers against streptococcus p neumoniae, mumps, rubella, and varicella were generally similar to the proportions at baseline. The results of the randomized, open -label Phase IIIb study (BN29739) that assessed if ocrelizumab recipients with RMS raise adequate humoral responses to select ed vaccines indicate that patients treated with ocrelizumab were able to mount humoral responses, albeit decreased, keyhole limpet hemocyanin neoantigen, and seasonal influenza vaccines. The results are summarized in the current version of the IB. Physicians should review the immunization status of patients being considered for treatment with ocrelizumab. Patients who require vaccination should complete it at least 6 weeks prior to initiation of ocr elizumab. For seasonal influenza vaccines, it is still recommended to vaccinate Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 8/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 patients on ocrelizumab. Vaccination with live or live -attenuated vaccines are not recommended during the treatment with ocrelizumab and until B cells have returned to normal l evels. Due to the potential depletion of B -cells in neonates and infants of mothers, who have been exposed to ocrelizumab during pregnancy, it is recommended that vaccination with live or live - attenuated vaccines should be delayed until B -cells have recov ered; therefore, measuring CD19 - positive B cell level, in neonates and infants, prior to vaccination is recommended. It is recommended that all vaccinations other than live or live -attenuated should follow the local immunization schedule and measurement of vaccine -induced response titers should be considered to check whether individuals can mount a protective immune resp onse because the efficacy of the vaccination may be decreased. 5.1.1.2 Potential Risks PML PML is an important potential risk for ocrelizumab and it has only been reported with ocrelizumab where the risk for PML was preexisting, specifically from prior immunosuppressive treatment (e.g. natalizumab or fingolimod treatment) because of prior natalizumab or fingolimod treatment . In all of these PML cases, the causality with ocrelizumab was not considered plausible. Based on the available information, it is r easonable to consider that the PML started before the first administration of ocrelizumab, given new symptom onset and/or MRI changes had already occurred on the previous therapy or during the wash out period, and was related to prior immunosuppressive tre atment. Physicians should be vigilant for early signs and symptoms of PML, which can include any new onset, or worsening of neurological signs or symptoms as these can be similar to an MS relapse. If PML is suspected, dosing with ocrelizumab must be withhe ld. Evaluation of PML, including MRI, confirmatory CSF testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should be considered. If PML is confirmed, ocrelizumab must be discontinued permanently. Please refer to Appen dix 6 for guidance for diagnosis of PML. Please see the IB for more details. Serious infections related to decrease in immunoglobulins (particularly in patients previously exposed to immunosuppressive/ immunomodulatory drugs or with pre - existing hypogammag lobulinaemia) Based on additional patient exposure an apparent association between sustained decrease in immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM) and serious infections with ocrelizumab treatment was observed. However, no pattern (e.g. type of infections, safety laboratory abnormalities beyond the decrease in Ig, latency, duration) was found that could identify a subset of patients at higher risk of serious infections. There was no difference in the pattern (type, latency, duration, outcome) of the serious infecti ons reported in this subset of patients compared to the overall serious infections profile. In addition, risk factors for a subset of patients at higher risk of serious infections could not be identified. Impaired Response to Vaccination Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 9/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 The degree of impa irment of B cell dependent humoral response to neo antigens and polysaccharide antigens and its clinical relevance are currently unknown in patients with MS. After treatment with ocrelizumab over 2 years, the proportion of patients with positive antibody titers against Streptococcus pneumoniae, mumps, rubella, and varicella were generally similar to the proportions at baseline. No data are available on the effects of vaccination in patients receiving ocrelizumab. Physicians should review the immunization status of patients being considered for treatment with ocrelizumab. Patients who require vaccination should complete it at least 6 weeks prior to initiation of ocrelizumab. The safety of immunization with live or live attenuated viral vaccines, following ocrelizumab therapy has not been studied and vaccination with live attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended while B cells are depleted. Neutropenia In the controlled treatment period, decreased neutrophils were observed in 12 to 15% of MS patients treated with ocrelizumab, in PPMS and RMS respectively. Most were mild to moderate in severity, and approximately 1% of the patients had Grade 3 or 4 neutro penia; no temporal association with infections was identified. Based on additional patient exposure, an association between neutropenia and serious infections with ocrelizumab treatment was not observed. 5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period After initiatio n of study drug , all adverse events will be reported until 48 96 weeks after the last dose of the study drug end of the Treatment Period , but may be extended in patients whose B -cells take longer to replete. Related SAEs must be collected and reported regardless of the time elapsed from the last study drug administration, even if the study has been closed. Unrelated SAEs must be collected and reported during the study through the end of the Safety Follow Up Period, which is at least 96 weeks after the last infusion , but may be extended in patients whose B cells take longer to replete. Section 5.4.2.2 Events that Occur after Study Drug Initiation After initiation of study drug, serious adverse events will be reported until 48 96 weeks after the end of th e Treatment Period last dose of study drug . Related SAEs must be collected and reported regardless of the time elapsed from the last study drug administration, even if the study has been closed. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 10/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 5.6 POST -STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious and non-serious adverse event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as 4896 weeks after the last dose of the study drug end of the Treatment Period ), if the event is believed to b e related to prior study drug treatment. 6. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN The analysis of this single -arm non -comparative study will be exploratory and primarily based on descriptive statistical methods. Unless otherwise sp ecified, statistical tests will be two -sided and the statistical significance level will be 5%. Corresponding 95% CIs will be presented as appropriate.

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd Objectives and Endpoints This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who have a suboptimal response to an adequate course of a disease modifying treatment (DMT). Specific ob jectives and corresponding endpoints for the study are outlined below . Efficacy Objective The primary objecti ve for this study is to assess the efficacy of ocrelizumab 600 mg intravenous (IV) given every 24 weeks on the basis of the following endpoint: Proportion of patients who have no evidence of disease activity (NEDA, as per protocol defined events) during a 96 -week period. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity w ill be calculated on the events starting from week 8 (baseline reset) when drug is fully active.

Study Design Description of Study This study is a prospective, multicenter, open -label, efficacy, and safety study in patients with RRMS who have a suboptimal resp onse to an adequate course of a DMT. An adequate course of prior DMT is defined as a stable dose of the same DMT administered for at least 6 months. The first dose of ocrelizumab will be administered as an initial dose of two 300 -mg infusions (600 mg tota l) in 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride each separated by 14 days (i.e., Days 1 and 15) followed by one 600 -mg infusion in 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride every 24 weeks for the study duration. Patients will be assessed for efficacy and safety every 24 weeks. The study will consist of the following periods: Screening period: Up to 4 weeks Treatment period: Open -label treatment period of 96 weeks (last dose administered at Week 72) A follow -up period of at least 2 years, which is independent of the DMT administered Follow -up Period: Patients who discontinue treatment early will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the Early Treatment Discontinuation Visit . Patients who complete the 96 weeks Treatment Period and, in agreement with their treating neurologist, decide not to continue in a separate long -term extension (LTE) study, will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period. Patients who decide to leave the study and switch to commercially marketed Ocrelizumab, eith er after completion of the 96 weeks Treatment Period or after early discontinuation of the 96 weeks Treatment Period, will not enter the safety Follow -up Period. Patients whose B -cells have not been repleted after 96 weeks of Follow -up Period will continu e with visits every 24 weeks, and telephone contacts every 8 weeks, until B -cell repletion (Prolonged B -cell monitoring). If the patients are receiving other B -cell targeted therapies, then the Follow -up Period will be stopped at 96 weeks regardless of the ir B-cell count. A structured telephone interview will be conducted by site personnel every 8 weeks between the study visits during the treatment period and follow -up to identify and collect information on any changes in the patient's health status that w arrant an unscheduled visit (including new or worsening neurological symptoms) and possible events or infections.

End of Study The end of the study treatment period has been defined as the date on which the last patient receiving the full study treatment reached the 96 -week visit. Exception will be made for patients who have EDSS change at Week 96 and need confirmation of EDSS sco re after a further 24 weeks. The end of the study is defined as the last patient last visit in the B -cell monitoring of the Follow - up Period. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 23/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 At the end of the study treatment, patients will be encouraged to be included in a separate LTE study to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of their DMT treatment and this is independent of the DMT administered. This LTE will also aim to evaluate the relationship between the primary endpoint of this study and long -term outcome. Length of Study The total lengt h of the study, from screening of the first patient to the end of the study, is expected to be approximately 5 years. This includes an enrollment period of approximately 12 months. Investigational Medicinal Products Test Product (Investigational Drug) The first dose of ocrelizumab will be administered as two 300 -mg IV infusions (600 mg total) in 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride each separated by 14 days (i.e., Days 1 and 15), followed by one 600-mg IV infusion in 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride every subsequent dose (i.e., every 24 weeks) for a maximum of 4 doses. Non-Investigational Medicinal Products Premedicate with 100 mg of methylprednisolone (or an equivalent) , administered by slow IV infusion, to be completed approximately 30 minutes prior to each ocrelizumab infusion, and an antihistamin ic drug (e.g., diphenhydramine) approximately 30 - 60 minutes before each infusion of ocrelizu mab to reduce the frequency and severity of infusion -related reactions (IRRs). The addition of an antipyretic (e.g., acetaminophen/ paracetamol) may also be considered. Statistical Methods Primary Analysis The primary efficacy analyses will include all enrolled patients who received any dose of ocrelizumab (intent -to-treat populati on). The analysis will be performed after the last CDP and CDI confirmation visit. The per -protocol population, defined as all patients who had 96 weeks of treatment and who did not have any major protocol violations that are deemed to potentially affect the efficacy and safety endpoints, will be us ed for supportive efficacy analyses of the primary endpoint. The evaluation of the clinical efficacy of ocrelizumab will be based upon the events in -between the baseline visit and week 96 visit. The MRI activity is evaluated from week 8 to week 96. The proportion of patients free from protocol -defined events up to Week 96 (i.e. patients with NEDA) will be calculated and the corresponding two -sided Clopper -Pearson 95% confidence interval (CI) will be presented. Logistic regr ession models will be used to identify predictors of response to treatment (freedom from protocol -defined events of disease activity). Variables that will be considered are: region, line of treatment (previous DMTs), gender, and baseline EDSS. In addition, specific efficacy endpoints, such as CDP, will be compared between patients with or without evidence of disease activity up to Week 96. Details about the missing data handling, as well as sensitivity analyses, will be specified in the statis tical analysis plan. Determination of Sample Size With a sample size of 750 patients, an observed NEDA rate of 30% will be estimated with a precision (half -width of the 95% CI around the estimate) of 3.3% based on the Clopper -Pearson method, i.e. the 95 % CI will be (26.7%, 33.4%). Even if the NEDA rate is different from the assumed rate of 30%, with the proposed sample size the precision of the estimate will remain smaller than 3.6% (value for a NEDA rate of 50%). The annualized relapse rate is another relevant outcome measure assessed in this study. Based on results from the pivotal Phase III studies WA21092 (OPERA I) and WA21093 (OPERA II), in Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 24/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 this study the adjusted annualized relapse rate assessed over two years is expected to be estimated with a pre cision of approximately 0.03. Interim Analyses No formal confirmatory efficacy interim analyses are planned. Exploratory analyses of selected endpoints may be performed during the course of the study, e.g. after all patients have completed the first 6 and 12 months of the treatment phase and the necessary data are available.

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 28/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 1. BACKGROUND 1.1 BACKGROUND ON MULTIP LE SCLEROSIS Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating, and degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States (U.S.) and 2.3million worldwide ( Tullman et al. 2013 ). MS primarily affects young adults, with 70% 80% of patients having an age of onset (i.e., initial visit to a physician) between 20 and 40 years (Anderson et al. 1992 ; Noonan et al. 2002 ), and has a strong gender bias, with approximately 64% 70% of diagnosed patients being women ( Goodin 2014 ). MS is clinically subcategorized into four phenotypic disease patterns distinguished by the occurrence and timing of relapses relative to disease onset and disability progression. These include relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS), progressive relapsing MS (PRMS), and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) (Lublin et al. 1996 ; Lublin et al. 2014 ). Approximately 85% of MS patients initially present with RRMS ( Confavreaux et al. 2000 ; Leray et al. 2015 ). The majority of RRMS patients will transition into SPMS within 20 -25 years ( Trojano et al. 2003 ). The clinical signs in MS can occur in isolation or in combination, and can include weakness, spasticity, gait and coordination imbalances, sensory dysfunction, vision loss, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, depression, chronic pain, sl eep disorders, and cognitive impairment (Tanasescu et al. 2015). Current diagnosis of definite MS involves both clinical (history and neurological exam) and paraclinical (for example, Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI], Spinal Tap, Evoked potentials) evidenc e. MS treatments tackle separately the acute exacerbations and their prevention. Symptomatic management of relapses involves the use of corticosteroids, while disease -modifying treatments (DMTs) aim to decrease the clinical relapse rate and concomitant in flammation within the CNS (Tanasescu et al. 2015). DMTs, which include immunomodulatory, anti -inflammatory, and immunosuppressive drugs, are used to slow the development of MS -related neurological dam age and disability progression. By providing a more eff ective approach to MS treatment, DMTs may improve quality of life for individuals with MS ( Weinstock -Guttman 2013). MS therapeutic landscape is changing rapidly. After several years in which first -line DMTs - glatiramer acetate (GA) and interferon beta (IFN) - constituted the principal treatment options, a variety of new agents for MS treatment are now approved by regulatory authorities or in phase II and III clinical trials (Tanasescu et al. 2015) . In 2004 natalizumab was approved for relapsing forms of MS and in 2014, alemtuzumab and peg IFN -1a. Fingolimod was the first oral DMT approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2010 for relapsing forms of MS (RMS) followed by teriflunomide in 201 2 and dimethyl fumarate in MA30005, Version 5 DMTs like IFN and GA are often used early in the course of disease and have a favourable benefit -to-risk profile, but they are only partially effective (Freedman 2014; Ziemssen et al. 2015) and up to 40% of patients continue to show disease activity on these treatments (Tanasescu et al. 2015), indicating the need for an alternative therapeutic strategy (Ziemssen et al. 2015). Possible treatment strategies for patients who have a suboptimal response to these DMT include switching to either another IFN/GA o r switching to a more effective DMT, namely fingolimod, natalizumab or alemtuzumab (Freedman 2014).). Switching patients early to a high -efficacy therapy that targets both focal and diffuse damage may impact the course of the disease and achieve long-term disease control (Ziemssen et al. 2015). Suppression of disease activity and disability progression as early as possible remains an important goal of therapy in MS. With the emergence of more efficacious therapies and a better understanding of the conseque nces of subclinical disease activity in recent years, physicians have a lower tolerance for allowing disease activity to persist because what is lost in MS cannot typically be regained. The potential risk of irreversible disease progression is therefore an important factor in the therapeutic decision making of patients and their physicians. Although there are now several approved therapies for RMS, some lack sufficient efficacy to quell progression of disability, while more effective therapies are often res erved for later use because of serious risks. Thus there remains a need for highly effective therapies with a benefit -risk profile that supports its expeditious use at any time during the course of disease to preserve CNS tissue and neurological function, stem accrual of irreversible disability, and improve the quality of life for people living with MS. 1.2 BACKGROUND ON OCRELI ZUMAB Ocrelizumab is a recombinant humanized anti -human that selectively targets CD20 -expressing B cells ( Klein et al. 2013 ), which are bel ieved to play a critical role in MS. It then interacts wit h the body's immune system to eliminate CD20 -positive B -cells. CD20 is a cell surface antigen found on pre -B cells, mature B cells, and memory B cells, but it is not expressed on lymphoid stem cells and plasma cells ( Stashenko et al. 1980 ; Loken et al. 1987 ; Tedder and Engel 1994 ). While ocrelizumab selectively depletes CD20 -expressing B cells (Kappos et al. 2011 ), the capacity of B -cell reconstitution and pre-existing humoral immunity are preserved ( Martin and Chan 2006 ; DiLillo et al. 2008 ). In addition, innate immunity and total T -cell numbers are not affected ( WA21493 Clinical Study Report ). See the Ocrelizumab Investigator's Brochure (IB) for additional details on nonclinical and clinical studies. Summary of Clinical Studies of Ocrelizumab in MS Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 30/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 In two double -blind, double -dummy Phase III global RMS trials (Studies WA21092 and WA21093), ocrelizumab 600 mg demons trated superior efficacy over subcutaneous IFN -1a 44 g (Hauser et al. 2015). Efficacy outcomes were consistent between trials and across the primary and key clinical and imaging secondary endpoints. Ocrelizumab 600 mg demonstrated statis tically significant superiority compared with IFN -1a on each of the following major efficacy endpoints: Relative reductions of 46% and 47% (both p 0.0001) in the protocol -defined annual relapse rate (ARR) in Studies WA21092 and WA21093, respectively (pr imary endpoint) A 40% relative reduction in both the 12 -week confirmed disability progression [CDP] (Hazards ratio [HR] 0.60 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45, anal ysis Studies WA21092 and WA21093. Each individual trial also demonst rated a significant relative risk reduction of 12 -week CDP and 24 -week CDP (43% reduction for both 12 - and 24 -week CDP in Study WA21092 and 37% reduction for both 12 - and 24 -week CDP i n Study WA21093) Relative reductions of 94% number of T1- gadolinium (Gd) -enhancing lesions per scan at Weeks 24, 48 and 96 in Study WA21092 and Study WA21093, respectively Relative reductions of 77% and 83% (both p 0.0001) in the total number of new and/or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions per scan at Weeks 24, 48 and 96 in Study WA21092 and Study WA21093, respectively In a Phase III global PPMS trial (Study WA25046), ocrelizumab 600 mg demonstrated statistically significan t superiority compared with placebo on each of the following major efficacy endpoints (Montalban et al. 2015) A 24% relative risk reduction in 12 -week CDP, the primary endpoint (HR = 0.98], p A 25% CDP 0.75 [95% CI: 0.58, 0.98], p = 0.0365) Relative reduction of 29% in the progression rate of timed 25 -foot walk from baseline to Week 120 (p = 0.0404) A decrease in the volume of T2 lesions by 3.4% over 120 weeks, compared with the placebo group in which the T2 lesion volume increased by 7.4% (p 0.0001) Relative reduction of 17.5% in whole brain volume loss from Week 24 to Week 120 (p = 0.0206). Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 31/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Clinical Safety The safety data included are from the three Phase III studies in RMS (Studies WA21092 and WA21093) and PPMS (Study WA25046); safety data from the Phase II study in RRMS (Study WA21493) is described in the IB. All four studies WA21092, WA21093, WA25046, and WA21493 have completed the controlled treatment period and are in op en-label extension phase. In the two double -blind, double -dummy RMS Phase III studies (pooled data of Studies WA21092 and WA21093) during the 96 -week controlled treatment period, ocrelizumab was well tolerated with lower rates of treatment discontinuations for adverse events (AEs) in patients treated with ocrelizumab 600 mg (3.5%) than in patients receiving IFN -1a (6.2%). The proportion of patients with AEs (83.3% in both groups) as well as the total number of AEs were similar in the ocrelizumab and the IFN -1a treatment groups over the 96 -week treatment period. The proportion of patients reporting infections was higher in the ocrelizumab group compared with the IFN -1a group, (58.4% vs. 52.4%, respectively). In addition, there were more events of infec tion in t he ocrelizumab group (1224 events) compared with the IFN -1a group (948 events) and the majority of the events were of Grade 1 or 2 intensity. The difference was primarily driven by more patients with upper respiratory tract infections in Ocreliz umab grou p. The proportion of patien ts with serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the ocrelizumab treatment group than in the IFN -1a treatment group (6.9% in the ocrelizumab treatment group versus 8.7% in the IFN -1a treatment group). Overall, the proporti on of patients with serious infections was lower in the ocrelizumab group (1.3%) than in the IFN -1a group (2.9%). Two serious infusion -related reactions (IRRs) were reported; one in the IFN -1a group (Grade 3) and one in the ocrelizumab group ( Grade 4). As expected, the proportion of patients experiencing IRRs were increased in the ocrelizumab group (34.3%) compared with the active control group (9.7%) who received dummy infusions. During the 96 -week controlled treatment period, a total of 6 malignancies were reported, 2 events ( 1 mantle cell lymphoma and 1 squamous cell carcinoma) occurred in 2 patients (0.2%) in the IFN -1a treatment group and 4 events (2 invasive ductal breast carcinoma , 1 renal cancer and 1 malignant melanoma) occurred in 4 patients (0.5%) in the ocrelizumab treatment group . Three deaths occurred in Studies WA21092 and WA21093; 2 patients (suicide and mechanical ileus) in the IFN -1a treatment group and 1 patient (suicide) in the ocrelizumab treatment group. In the PPMS Phase III double blind placebo controlled Study WA25046, ocrelizumab was well tolerated with a similar proportion of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation from treatment (4.1%) compared with the placebo group (3.3%). The proportion of patients who experienced at least one AE was 90% i n the placebo group compared with 95% in the ocrelizumab group. Taking into account that twice as many patients were ran domized to ocrelizumab than placebo, the number of AEs experienced Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 32/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 by patients with an AE was simi lar (1762 events in the placebo group and 3690 events in the ocrelizumab group). The proportion of patients who experienced an infection was 69.8% in the ocrelizumab group compared with 67.8% in the placebo group. The proportion of patients with serious infections was similar in both groups: 5.9% in the placebo group compared with 6.2% in the ocrelizumab group. As expected, the proportion of patients who rep orted IRRs was higher in the ocrelizumab group (39.9%) compared with placebo (25.5%). Overall, 5 patients (1.0%) experienced a serious IRR in the ocrelizumab group. A total of 15 malignancies in 13 patients were reported: 2 events (basal cell carcinoma a nd adenocarcinoma of the cervix) occurred in 2 patients (0.8%) in the placebo group and 13 events (5 basal cell car cinoma, 2 invasive ductal breast carcinoma, 1 anaplastic large -cell lymphoma, 1 breast cancer, 1 endometrial cancer, 1 invasive breast carcinoma, 1 malignant fibrous histiocytoma, 1 pancreatic carcinoma metastatic) occurred in 11 patients (2.3%) in the ocr elizumab group. The proportion of patients with SAEs (22.2% in the placebo group compared with 20.4% in the ocrelizumab group), was similar in both groups. There were 5 deaths during the controlled treatment period, one in the placebo gr oup (road traffic accident) and 4 in the ocrelizumab group (pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, pancreatic carcinoma, pneumonia aspiration). For more detailed information, see IB. 1.3 STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFIT -RISK ASSESSM ENT Over the past two decades, there has been an increase in the number and type of available treatments for RMS. Yet, despite an adequate course of treatment with a DMT, a significant proportion of treated patients with RMS will show signs of disease activit y (Freedman 2014; Ziemssen et al. 2015, Tanasescu et al. 2015 ). Suboptimal responses defined as relapse, confirmed disability progression, and/or new Gd-enhancing or T2 lesion(s) on brain MRI, are reported in approximately one -third of patients receiving IFN- therapy ( Bergvall et al. 2014 ; Durelli et al. 2008 ; Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2005 ; Waubant et al. 2003 ). Disease activity while receiving DMT is associated with poorer long -term o utcomes ( Bermel et al. 2013 ), thus subsequent trea tment with a more effective thera py may be warranted in patients with breakthrough disease. Consequently, reported rates of treatment switching for suboptimal responses range from 20% to 35% of patients ( Rio et al. 2012 ; Gajofatto et al. 2009 ; Teter et al. 2014 ). While clinical experience and retrospective studies suggest that better disease control is obtained by escalating to higher effi cacy therapy, few prospective studies have been conducted. In one prospective, observational study, Prosperini and colleagues evaluated outcomes of patients who failed first -line treatment with IFN - or GA and switched to a different IFN - formulation or GA (switching group) or escalated to natalizumab (escalating group) (Prosperini et al. 2012). At 1 year, no significant differences between the two groups were observed in disease activity (i.e., relapse, Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 33/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 disability progression, MRI activity, and combined activity). However, after 2 years, significantly greater proportions of patients who had escalated to natalizumab than those who switched between IFN - and GA were free from all disease activity measures. In the Phase III CARE MS II trial, patients with 1 relapse while receiving IFN - or GA therapy were randomized to IFN - or alemtuzumab treatment. Significant improvements in relapse rate and accumula tion of disability were reported with alemtuzumab versus IFN- at 1 year (Coles et al. 2012 ). Assessing efficacy and safety in patients who switch to ocrelizumab after a suboptimal response to an adequate course of a DMT represents an important question for clinici ans. Efficacy and safety data in patients who have switched to ocrelizumab are limited. The Phase II study provided initial evidence that ocrelizumab could be effective at further reducing MS disease activity following initial IFN - therapy and demonstra ted the efficacy in reducing the disease activity as measured by T1 Gd enh ancement already after 8 weeks as shown in the figure below. Figure 1 Gd-enhancing lesions by week in each study group in Phase II study of ocrelizumab Additional data will also be available on previously treated patients in two completed Phase III studies (Studies WA21092 [OPERA I], n=106 a limited number of patients. It is important to underline that the vast majority of the subjects included in OPERA I and OPERA II continue the safe ty and efficacy follow -up in an open label extension (OLE) phase of the study. Patients included in the IFN arm have been given the opportunity to be treated with ocrelizumab in the OLE phase of the study. This setting enables efficacy and safety data coll ection on subjects switching from IFN to ocrelizumab. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 34/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 other DMTs, such as teriflunomide, fingolimod or dimethyl fumarate, is currently not available. The benefit -risk profile of ocrelizumab appears to be favorable based on the r esults of the pivotal Phase III studies as described in Section 1.2. However, more data from patients who switch to higher efficacy therapies from large scale, prospective studies are needed. Therefore, a dedicated prospective study to specifically evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in patients who have a suboptimal response to an adequate course of a DMT is needed to address this import ant clinical question. Based upon the Phase II data, and to allow the real evaluation of the treatment effect, the MRI activity should be evaluated starting from week 8. By introducing a MRI 8 weeks after baseline visit might also enable exc lusion, from a safety point of view, of a possible progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) infection carried over from a previous DMT treatment (i.e. fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate or natalizumab). 2. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPO INTS This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in patients with RRMS who have a suboptimal response to an adequate course of DMT. A suboptimal response is defined by having one or more clinically reported MS relapse(s), OR one or more T1 Gd -enhanced lesion(s), OR two or more new or enlarging T2 lesions on MRI while being on a stable dose of the same DMT for at least 6 months. In addition, in patients receiving stable doses of the same approved DMT for more than a year, the event of suboptimal response must have occurred within the last 12 months of treatment with this DMT. Patients will be encouraged to enter a long -term follow -up of at least 2 years to allow the evaluation and possible contribution of the primary outcome measure of no evidence of disease activi ty (NEDA) or its sub -elements on the longer term evolution of the disease. Specific objectives and corresponding endpoints for the study are outlined below. 2.1 EFFICACY OBJECTIVES 2.1.1 Primary Efficacy Objective The primary objective for this study is to assess t he efficacy of ocrelizumab 600 mg intravenous (IV) given every 24 weeks on the basis of the following endpoint: Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 35/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Proportion of patients who have NEDA, as per protocol defined events during a 96 - week period. The MRI activity will be calculated on the events starting from week 8 (baseline reset) when drug is fully active. The definition of a protocol -defined event of disease activity is the occurrence of at least one of the following while on treatment with ocrelizumab: A protocol -defined relapse as defined in Section 4.5.4 24 weeks confirmed d isability progression based on increases in EDSS while on treatment with ocrelizumab A T1 Gd -enhanced and/or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesion on MRI after Week 8 compared to the Week 8 MRI scan 2.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Objectives The secondary objective for this study is to evaluate the efficacy of o crelizumab 600 mg IV given every 24 weeks on the basis of the following endpoints: The proportions of patients free from a protocol -defined event of disease activity during a 24 -week period and a 48 -week period Time to first protocol -defined event of disease activity Change in EDSS from baseline to Week 96 Proportion of patients who, over a 96 -week period, have Confirmed Disability Improvement (CDI) Confirmed Disability Progression (CDP) or stable disability (i.e. neither CDI nor CDP). Annualized rate of protocol -defined relapses at Week 96 Time to onset of first protocol -defined relapse Time to onset of 24 weeks CDP Time to onset of first new and/or enlarging T2 lesion Total number of T1 Gd -enhanced lesions detected by brain MRI at Weeks 24, 48 and 96 Change in total T2 lesion volume detected by brain MRI from baseline to Week 96 Volume and number of new and/or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions from baseline to Weeks 24, 48 and 96 Change in T1 hypointense lesion volume from baseline to Weeks 48 and 96 Change in brain volume from baseline measured at Weeks 24, 48 and 96 Change from baseline in cognitive performance at Week 48 and Week 96 as measured by the BICAMS (Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis) Ocrelizumab \u2014F.

STUDY DESIGN 3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE S TUDY This study is a prospective, multice nter, open -label, efficacy and safety study in patients with RRMS who have had a suboptimal response to an adequate course of a DMT. An adequate course of prior DMT is def ined as a stable dose of the same DMT administered for at least 6 months. The first dose of ocrelizumab will be administered as an initial dose of two 300 -mg infusions (600 mg total) in 250 mL 0.9% Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 37/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 each separated by 14 days (i.e., Days 1 and 15) followed by one 600 -mg infusion in 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride every 24 weeks for the remainder of the study duration. This study will enroll 750 patients. Patients will be assessed for efficacy and safety every 24 weeks as described in the Schedule of Assessments presented in Appendix 1 . The study will consist of the following periods: Screening period: Up to 4 weeks Treatment period: Open -label treatment period of 96 weeks (last dose administered at Week 72) A follow -up period of at least 2 years, which is independent of the DMT administered Follow -up Period: Patients who discontinue treatment early will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the Early Treatment Discontinuation Visit . Patients who complete the 96 wee ks Treatment Period and, in agreement with thei r treating neurologist, decide not to continue in a separate long-term extension (LTE) study, will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period. Patients who decide to leave the study and switch to commercially marketed Ocrelizumab, either after completion of the 96 weeks Treatment Period or after early discontinuation of the 96 weeks Treatment Period, will not enter the safety Follow -up Period. Patients whose B -cells have not been repleted after 96 weeks of Follow -up Period will continue with visits every 24 weeks, and telephone contacts every 8 weeks, until B -cell repletion (Prolonged B -cell monitoring). If the patients are receiving other B -cell targeted therapies, then the Follow -up Period will be stopped at 96 weeks regardless of their B - cell count. A structured telephone interview will be conducted by site personnel every 8 weeks between the study visits during the treatment period and follo w-up to identify and collect information on any changes in the patient's health status that warrant an unscheduled visit (including new or worsening neurological symptoms) and possible events or infections.

A schedule of assessments is provided in Appendix 1 . Figure 2 Overview of Study Procedures DMTs = disease modifying treatments; IV = intravenous; RRMS = relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. 3.1.2 Screening Patients screened for this study should not be withdrawn from DMT therapies for the sole purpose of meeting eligibility for the trial. Patients who d iscontin ue their current therapy for non -medical rea sons should be informed of treatment options before deciding to enroll in the study. Investigators should refer to the local label for discontinuation/wash out of previous DMTs. The summary of product characteris tics (SmPCs) of DMTs for EMEA countries are provided in Appendix 8. After providing written informed consent, patients will enter a screening period (up to 4 - weeks) to be evaluated for eligibility. Re-screening of patients is allowed in this protocol. In case a patient needs to be re - screened there is no need to sign a ne w ICF if the re -screening is done within 2 months after signing the ICF; the patients should only be asked to re -sign and re -date the previously signed ICF to confirm that they are still willing to participate in the study. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 39/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 3.1.3 Treatment Period Eligible patien ts will be treated with an initial dose of two 300 -mg infusions (600 mg total) in 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride each separated by 14 days (i.e., Days 1 and 15) followed by one 600 -mg infusi on in 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride every 24 weeks for the remainder of study duration. Laboratory samples can be taken up to 2 weeks prior to the scheduled study visit. Results should be available prior dosing, except for John Cunningham virus (JCV) and immunoglobulins (Ig) (plasma samples collected and stored centrally), wh ich will be analyzed upon request and CD8 and CD19 (no interference with re -treatment). For patients presenting with EDSS change at Week 96, the EDSS score will be confirmed after a further 24 weeks. Criteria for Re -Treatment with Ocrelizumab Prior to re-treatment with ocrelizumab, patients will be evaluated for the following conditions and laboratory abnormalities. If any of these are present prior to re -dosing, further administration of ocrelizumab should be suspended until these are resolved or held indefinitely: Life threatening ( Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] Grade 4) infusion -related event that occurred during a previous ocrelizumab infusion Any significant or uncontrolled medical condition or treatment -emergent, clinica lly significant laboratory abnormality Active infection other than a fungal nailbed infection. The re -treatment should be delayed until the active infection is treated , and patie nt fully recovered CD4 cell count < 250/L Ongoing pregnancy At the end of the study treatment the patients will be encouraged to be included in a separate LTE study to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of their DMT treatment and this is independent of the DMT. This LTE will also aim to evaluate the relationship betwee n the primary endpoint of this study and long -term outcome. Patients who discontinue treatment early will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the Early Treatment Discontinuation Visit . Patients who complete the 96 weeks Treatment Period and, in agreement with their treating neurologist, decide not to continue in a separate LTE study, will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period (see Section 3.1.4 ). Patients who decide to leave the study and switch to commercially marketed Ocrelizumab, either after completion of the 96 weeks Treatment Period or after early discontinuation of the 96 weeks Treatment Period, will not ent er the safety Follow -up Period.

Patients who complete the 96 weeks Treatment Period and, in agreement with their treating neurologist, decide not to continue in a separate LTE study, will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period. Patients who decide to leave the study and switch to commercially marketed Ocrelizumab, either after completion of the 96 weeks Treatment Period or after early discontinuation of the 96 weeks Treatment Period , will not enter the safety Follow -up Period. Any patient whose peripheral blood B -cell count remains depleted after this period will continue to be monitored at 24 -week intervals until the B -cell count has returned to the baseline value or to lower limit of normal (LLN) range, whichever is lower. Figure 4 provides an overview of the Follow -up Period, which is the variable B -cell monitoring period. A schedule of assessments for the Follow -up Perio d is presented in Appendix 2 . Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 42/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 visit (including new or worsening neurological symptoms) and possible events or infections. 3.1.5 Planned Total Sample Size This study will enroll approximately 750 patients. Please refer to the Section 6.1 for more details. 3.2 END OF STUDY AND LEN GTH OF STUDY The end of the study treatment period has been defined as the date on which the last patient receiving the full study treatment reached the 96 -week visit. Exception will be made for patients that have EDSS change at Week 96 and need confirm ation of EDSS score after a further 24 weeks. The end of the study is defined as the last patient last visit in the B -cell monitoring of the Follow -Up period. At the end of the study treatment, patients will be encouraged to be included in a separate LTE study to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of their DMT treatment, and this is independent of the DMT. This LTE will also aim to evaluate the relationship between the primary endpoint of this study and long -term outcome. The total length of the stu dy, from screening of the first patient to the end of the study, is expected to be approximately 5 years. This includes an enrollment period of approximately 12 months. 3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN This is a Phase IIIb, prospective, multicenter, open -label, study to assess the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab in patients with RRMS who have a suboptimal response to an adequate course of a DMT. The efficacy and safe ty of ocrelizumab has been studied in three randomized, double -blind, parallel group, controlled Phase III studies (WA21092 and WA21093 in relapsing MS and WA25046 in PPMS) with further follow -up ongoing in OLE phase. As there are limited data in patients who have switched to ocrelizumab after a suboptimal response to an adequate course of a DMT, a single -arm study is considered appropriate given the aims of this study. As the aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of ocrelizumab in this setting, the MRI results will be evaluated starting from week 8, as demonstrated in the Phase II clinical trial. 3.3.1 Rationale for Ocrelizumab Dose and Schedule The dose level of ocrelizumab administered in this study is 600 mg. The first dose will be administered as tw o 300 -mg IV infusions in 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride each separated by 14 days in order to lower the amount of ocrelizumab administered upon first exposure. The remaining doses will be administered as single 600 -mg infusion in 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride every 24 weeks to assess the tolerability of the intended administration regimen. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 43/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 This dosing regimen is anticipated to be well -tolerated and is consistent with the dosing regimen used in Studies WA21092 and WA21093 in patients with RMS. 3.3.2 Rationale for Pati ent Population This study will be conducted in RRMS patients who show a suboptimal response to an adequate course of a DMT. RRMS is the most common type of MS, a pproximately 85% of MS patients present initially with RRMS ( Confavreaux et al. 2000 ; Leray et al. 2015 ). Despite an adequate course of trea tment with a DMT, a significant proportion of treated patients with RRMS will show signs of disease activity (Freedman 2014; Ziemssen et al. 2015; Tanasescu et al. 2015) . Suboptimal responses are reported in approximately one - third of patients receiving DM T and therefore this population is considered to be appropriate to study the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab. 4.

For information on the formulation and handling of ocrelizumab, see the Ocrelizumab IB and Drug Preparation Guidelines. 4.3.2 Dosage, Administration, and Compliance 4.3.2.1 Ocrelizumab The first dose of ocrelizumab will be administered as two 300 -mg infusions (600 mg total) in 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride ea ch separated by 14 days ( i.e., Days 1 and 15), followed by one 600 -mg infusion in 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride every subsequent dose (i.e., every 24 weeks) for a maximum of 4 doses. It is anticipated that the patient will need to stay at the hospital or clinic for a full day for the infusion visits. Ocrelizumab infusions should be initiated and supervised by an experienced professional with access to appropriate medical support to manage severe reactions such as s erious IRRs. Each ocrelizumab infusion should be given as a slow IV infusion over approximately 150 minutes (2.5 hours) for the 300 mg dose and approximately 215 minutes (3.6 hours) for the 600 mg dose. To reduce potential IRRs, all patients will receive prophylactic treatment with 100 mg of methylprednisolone, or equiva lent, administered by slow IV infusion, to be completed approximately 30 minutes before the start of each ocrelizumab infusion, and an antihistaminic drug (e.g., diphenhydramine) approximately 30 60 minutes before each infusion of ocrelizumab . Additiona l premedication is recommended, see Section 4.3.3 . Hypotension, as a symptom of IRR, may occur during ocrelizumab IV infusions. Therefore, withholding antihypertensive treatments should be considered for 12 hours prior to and throughout each ocrelizumab infusion. Ocrelizumab must not be administered as an IV push or bolus. Well -adjusted infusion pumps should be used to control the infusion rate, and ocrelizumab should be infused through a dedicated line. It is important not to use evacuated glass containers, which require vented administration sets, to prepare the infusion because this causes foaming as air bubbles pass through the solution. The patient will need to remain at the clinic at every visit for at least 1 hour after the completion of the infusion for observation. After completion of the infusion, the IV cannula should remain in situ for at least 1 hour to allow for administration of drugs Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 49/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 intravenously, if necessary, in the eve nt of a delayed reaction. If no adverse events occur during this period of time, the IV cannula may be removed , and the patient may be discharged. See the Ocrelizumab IB and Drug Preparation Guidelines for detailed instructions on drug preparation, storag e, and administration. An overview of the ocrelizumab dosing is presented in Table 1. Table 1 Overview of Ocrelizumab Dos ing Group 1st Dose a,c 2nd Dose b,c 3rd Dose b,c 4th Dose b,c (Weeks 1 24) (Weeks 24 48) (Weeks 48 72) (Weeks 72 96) Day 1 Infusion Day 15 Infusion Week 24 Infusion Week 48 Infusion Week 72 Infusion Ocrelizumab 300 mg IV in 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride 300 mg IV in 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride 600 mg IV in 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride 600 mg IV in 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride 600 mg IV in 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride IV = intravenous. Note: Before each infusion of ocrelizumab, 100 mg of methylprednisolone IV and an antihistaminic drug will be administered to reduce the potential for infusion -related reactions. Each dose has a duration of 24 weeks. The open -label treatment period consists of 96 weeks of treatment; patients will receive a maximum of 4 doses. a The first dosing will consist of two IV infusions separated by 14 days (i.e., Days 1 and 15). b Beginning with the second dose, a single infusion of ocrelizumab will be administered. c Prior to the next infusion, a clinical evaluation will be performed to ensure that the patien t remains eligible for retreatment. Guidelines for dosage modification and treatment interruption or discontinuation are provided in Section 5.1.4 . Any overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be noted on the Study Drug Administration electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) . AEs associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the AE eCRF. 4.3.3 Prop hylactic Treatment Premedicate with 100 mg of methylprednisolone (or an equ ivalent), administered by slow IV infusion, to be completed approximately 30 minutes prior to each ocrelizumab infusion and an antihistaminic drug (e.g., diphenhydramine) approxima tely 30 - 60 minutes before each ocrelizumab infusion to reduce the frequency and severity of IRRs. The addition of an antipyretic (e.g., acetaminophen/paracetamol) may also be considered. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 50/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Any overdose or incorrect administration of methylprednisolone should be noted on the Pre-Infusion Prophylactic Treatment eCRF . Adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of methylprednisolone and antihistaminic drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Patients administered a sed ating antihistamine for the treatment or prevention of IRRs should be given appropriate warnings concerning drowsiness and potential impairment of ability to drive or operate machinery. 4.3.4 Investigational Medicinal Product Accountability The IMP required for completion of this study (ocrelizumab) will be provided by the Sponsor where required by local health authority regulations. The study site will acknowledge receipt of IMP, using the interactive voice/Web response system (IxRS) to confirm the shipment con dition and content. Any damaged shipments will be replaced. The IMP will either be disposed of at the study site according to the study site's institutional standard operating procedure or returned to the Sponsor with the appropriate documentation. The site's method of IMP destruction must be agreed to by the Sponsor. The site must obtain written authorization from the Sponsor before any unused IMP is destroyed, and IMP destruction must be documented on the appropriate form. Accurate records of all IMPs received at, dispensed from, returned to, and disposed of by the study site should be recorded on the Drug Inventory Log. 4.3.5 Post -Trial Access to Ocrelizumab Patients who completed the study and decided, in agreement with their treating neurologist, to conti nue on ocrelizumab treatment can be rolled -over in a separate ocrelizumab LTE study. 4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY Concomitant therapy includes any medication (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by a patient within 6 weeks prior to the screening visit to the study completion/ discontinuation visit. All such medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the Concomitant Medications eCRF. 4.4.1 Permitted Therapy Patients who use oral contraceptives, hormone -replacement therapy, or other maintenance therapy should continue their use. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 51/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 4.4.2 Prohibited Therapy No formal drug -drug interaction studies have been conducted with ocrelizumab, as no drug-drug interactions are expec ted via the Cytochromes P450, other metabolizing enzymes or transporters. Ocrelizumab is a monotherapy and has not been studied in combination with other DMTs. As with other immunomodulatory therapies, exercise caution when initiating ocrelizumab after an immunosuppressive therapy, and when initiating another therapy after ocrelizumab, taking into consideration the potential for overlapping pharmacodynamic effects. Immunosuppressants, lymphocyte -depleting agents, or lymphocyte -trafficking blockers should N OT be administered while patient is B -cell depleted. Hypotension, as a symptom of IRR, may occur during ocrelizumab IV infusions. Therefore, withholding antihypertensive treatments should be considered for 12 hours prior to and throughout each ocrelizumab infusion. See the Ocrelizuma b IB for a more detailed safety profile . In addition, the investigator should contact the Medical Monitor if questions arise regarding medications not listed above. 4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS Please see Appendix 1 for the schedule of assessments to be performed during the study. 4.5.1 Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before performing any study -related procedu res. Informed Consent Forms for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be maintained at the study site. All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed by the investigator to confirm that patients meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. 4.5.2 Medical History and Demographic Data Patients' demographics (age, gender, self -reported race) and neurological examination will be collected. Medical History will include clinically significant diseases, surgeries, reprodu ctive status, smoking history, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or homeopathic remedies, and nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 6 weeks prior to the screening visit: Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 52/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 MS disease history: First MS symptom: date, symptoms, severity, MRI. Diagnosis of MS: Date, disease status, (EDSS, relapses, MRI) and, when available, criteria on which the diagnosis is based. Baseline disease status : EDSS, Number of relapses in the previous year, MRI lesions Treatment history: DMT: name, dose, start date (EDSS, relapses), stop date with disease status and reasons for discontinuation 4.5.3 Physical Examinations A complete physical examination should include an evaluation of head, eye, ear, nose, and throat (HEENT), cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, and gastrointestinal system s. The following assessments will also be conducted: neurological examination (see Section 4.5.4 ), relapse description, EDSS Section 4.5.6 ), Section 4.5.7 ). Changes from baseline abno rmalities should be recorded in patient notes. New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities not related to MS should be recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF. Height and weight will be measured at scree ning only. See Appendix 1 (Schedule of Assessments) for the timing of these assessments. 4.5.4 Neurological Examinations Neurological examinations will be used to distinguish relapse in MS from another neurological (non -MS) disorder. MS relapses should be record ed throughout the treatment period on a dedicated MS relapse eCRF page. See Appendix 1 (Schedule of Assessments) for the timing of these assessments. A protocol -defined MS relapse is an occurrence of new or worsening neurologi cal symptoms attributable to MS that meets the following criteria: Symptoms must persist for >24 hours and should not be attributable to confounding clinical factors (e.g., fever, infection, injury, adverse reactions to medications) Symptoms should be preceded by neurological stability for at least 30 days Symptoms should be accompanied by new objective neurological worsening determined with a timely EDSS/ Functional Systems Score (FSS) assessment, consistent with an increase of at least: 0.5 points on EDSS scale or 2 points on one of the following FSS scales: pyramidal, ambulation, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, or visual or 1 point on two or more of the following FSS scales: pyramidal, Roche Ltd 53/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Episodic spasms, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, mood change or bladder or bowel urgency or incontinence will not suffice to establish a relapse (Please note: Sexual dysfunction and fatigue need not be scored). All patients with new neurological symptoms sugge stive of a relapse should have an EDSS/FSS assessment performed as soon as possible, ideally within 7 days of the onset of symptoms . EDSS/FSS data is needed to allow the Sponsor to confirm whether the reported clinical relapse meets the criteria for a Prot ocol-defined relapse. Please note: All MS relapses (i.e., regardless of whether they may meet criteria for a protocol -defined relapse which will be adjudicated by the Sponsor based on the above criteria) will be recorded on a pre -specified eCRF \"MS relapse \" form. As infection is a potentially serious complication of B cell-depleting therapy, investigators will also screen patients f or signs and symptoms of PML by evaluating neurological deficits localized to the cerebral cortex, such as cortical symptoms/s igns, visual cerebellar symptoms/signs (e.g., ga it abnormalities, limb incoordination). Patients with suspected PML should be withheld from ocrelizumab treatment until PML i s ruled out by complete clinical evaluation and appropriate diagnostic testing. A patient with confirmed PML should be withdrawn from the study. PML should be reported as a serious adverse event (with all available information) with immediate notificatio n of the Medical Monitor. Please refer to Appendix 6 for guidance for diagnosis of PML. Cognitive status: The cognitive status of the patient will be evaluated at baseline, and further yearly for the full duration of the trial with the use of BICAMS components. 4.5.5 Vital Signs Vital signs will include measurements of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and oral or auricular temperature while the patient is in a seated position. Vital signs should be taken within 45 m inutes prior to the premedication methylprednisolone (or an equivalent) infusion. In addition, vital signs should be obtained prior to the ocrelizumab infusion then every 15 minutes ( 5 minutes) for the first hour, followed by every 30 minutes (\u00b1 10 minu tes) until 1 hour after the end of the infusion. Vital sign measurements will be performed as outlined in the schedule of assessments (see Appendix 1 ). Record abnormalities observed before enrollment on the Ge neral Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. At subsequent visits, record new or worsened clinically significant abnormalities on the Adverse Event eCRF (as presented in Section 5.3.5.6 ). Ocrelizumab 5 4.5.6 Assessment of Disabil ity Disability in MS will be measured by the EDSS. See Appendix 1 (Schedule of Assessments) for the timing of these assessments. The EDSS is based on a standard neurological examination, incorporating seven functional systems (pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, and cerebral [or mental], plus \"othe r\") rated and scored as FSSs. Each FSS is an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 to 5 or 6. These ratings are then used in conjunction with observations and information concerning ambulation and use of assistive devices to determine the EDSS score. The EDSS is a disability scale that ranges in 0.5 -point steps from 0 (normal) to 10 (death) (see Appendix 3 ). 4.5.7 Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI will be used to monitor CNS lesions and potentially other pathophysiology, such as inflammation and neurodegeneration. Brain MR I scans will be obtained at study visits as shown in the Schedule of Assessments (see Appendix 1 ). All efforts should be made to obtain the brain MRI scans before the next ocrelizumab infusion and the scans should be reviewed locally for the presence of any non -MS pathology, including P ML, before the next infusion is administered. If patients receive corticosteroids for a treatment of an MS relapse, e very effort should be made to obtain the scan prior to the first steroid dose if the pre -steroid scan is within 1 week of the scheduled visit. In patients already receiving corticosteroids for an MS relapse, there should be an interval of at least 3 weeks between the la st dose of corticosteroids and the scan, to allow for normalization of blood -brain barrier. MRI scans will be read by a centralized reading center for efficacy endpoints. Further details on scanning acquisition sequences, methods, handling, transmission of the scans, and certification of site MRI radiologist/technicians are described in a separate MRI technical manual. Assessments will include T1 -weighted scans before and after injection of gadolinium contrast, and may also include, but may not be limited to: fluid -attenuated inversion -recovery (FLAIR), proton density -weighted, and -weighted scans. The MRI activity will be b ased upon the MRI scan taken on week 8 when the drug has reached its anti-inflammatory activity. The total brain vol ume and the different white and grey matter structures will be measured over the full duration of the study and follow -up period. 4.5.8 Laboratory, Biomarker, and Other Biological Samples Laboratory samples can be taken up to 2 weeks prior to the scheduled stud y visit. Results should be available prior to dosing, except for anti -JCV antibodies (plasma samples Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 55/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 collected and stored centrally), which will be analyzed upon request, and CD8 and CD19 (no interference with re -treatment). Pre-infusion laboratory samples should be drawn so that routine laboratory test results are available for review before the infusion, unless otherwise specified. Routine laboratory assessments (performed in local laboratory) will include the following: Hematology (hemoglobin, hematocr it, platelet count, red blood cell [RBC] count, white blood cell [WBC] count, percent and absolute differenti al creatinine, random glucose, potassium, sodium) Urine dipstick at site Pregnancy test: All women of childbearing potential (including those who have had a tubal ligation) will have a serum pregnancy test at screening. A urine pregnancy test should be performed prior to methylprednisolone infusion in subsequent doses. If a urine pregnancy test is positive, it must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. The follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) test is only applicable to confirm postmenopausal status in female patients. Viral serology and detection: Hepatitis B (HBsAg and HBcAb confirmed, if positive, by positive viral DNA PCR) For enrolled patients with negative HBsAg and positive total HBcAb, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA (by PCR) must be repeated every 24 weeks Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody Lymphocytes subtypes Whole -blood samples will be collected to determine the duration of B -cell depletion and recovery (CD19+) and T -cell counts (CD4+, CD8+) Additional laboratory samples will be collected: Plasma samples for anti -JCV antibody assessments at baseline, 1 year and end of study. Samples will be stored in a central laboratory until one year after last patient last visit (LPLV) for further analysis upon request. For sam pling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual. Per local Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC) requirements, additional testing may be required for selected patients or selected centers to exclu de tuberculosis, Lyme disease, HAM, AIDS, hereditary disorders, connective tissue disorders, or sarcoidosis. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann 56/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 4.5.9 Patient -Reported Outcomes PRO data will be elicited from patients in this study to better characterize patient quality of life and treatment satisf action while on ocrelizumab. MSIS -29 is a 29 -item questionnaire designed to measure the physical and psychological impact of MS from the patient's perspective. TSQM II is a 14 -item subject assessed evaluation of treatment medication using a 7 - point Liker t-type scale rated as follows: 1=Extremely Dissatisfied to 7= Extremely Satisfied. Domain scores range from 0 -100, wit h higher scores representing higher satisfaction. TSQM has been validated using a national panel study of chronic disease (Atkinson et al. 2004). SymptoMScreen: composite score based upon a battery of seven -point Likert scales for 11 distinct domains commonly affected by MS: mobility, dexterity, vision, fatigue, cognition, bladder function, sensation, spasticity, body pain, depression and an xiety. Total score and subscale scores are assessed over the study duration (Green et al. 2015). Employment Status WPAI: questionnaire that assesses the effect of MS on ability to work and perform regular activities. Please refer to Appendix 5 for detailed information on the PROs. The PRO instruments, translated as required in the local language, will be distributed by the investigator staff and completed in their entirety by the patient. To ensure instrument validity and tha t data standards meet health authority requirements, PRO questionnaires should be self -administered at the investigator site prior to the completion of other study assessments and the administration of study drug. Patients must complete these measures prio r to the patient having any tests and prior to any discussion of the patient's progress with their physician or any other healthcare personnel at the site. PRO assessments will be performed as outlined in the schedule of assessments (see Appendix 1 ) 4.5.10 BICAMS The Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis (BICAMS) battery includes the following tests of mental processing speed and memory: Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) California Verbal Learning Test 2 (CVLT Test 5 Since CVLT -II is not yet available in all the languages of the countries participating in this study, the patients will not be assessed with this portion of the BICAMS. The patients will only need to complete the two components of the BICA MS test battery (Symbol Digit Modalities Test and Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised). Please note that the BICAMS should be administered only after the patient has completed all the PRO assessme nts. The recommended order of administration is first the SDMT, followed by the BVMT -R. The BICAMS will be scored centrally by a global reader and the results will be provided to the sites to be recorded in the eCRF. 4.5.11 Telephone Interviews The telephone interview will be conducted by site personnel familiar with the patient(s) every 8 weeks (\u00b1 3 days) between the study visits during the treatment period and follow -up. The purpose of this semi -structured interview is to identify new or worsen ing neurological symptoms that warrant an unscheduled visit and collect information on possible events of infections. The site will record in the eCRF the telephone interview as \"Done\" or \"Not Done\" and documentation of the interview will be maintained in the patient's study file. Please refer to Appendix 4 for detailed information. 4.5.12 Patient Diary (optional) Due to the low frequency of study visits (every 6 months) and the structured telephone interviews (every 8 weeks between the study visits), patient diaries are proposed as an additional optional tool to help further improve the collection and documentation of Adverse Events and concomitant medications . The decision to use the patient diary is left to the discretion of each investigator. The investigator must ensure that required EC/IRB approval was obtained before implementing the patient diary at his/her site. Additional instructions around the use of an optional Patient Diary are provided in Appendix 7. 4.6 PATIENT, TREATMENT, STUDY, AND SITE DISC ONTINUATION 4.6.1 Patient Discontinuation Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. In addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time. Reasons for withdrawal from t he study may include, but are not limited to, the following: Patient withdrawal of consent at any time Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize the patient's safety if he or she continues in the study Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 58/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Patient non -complian ce, defined as failure to follow dosing instruct ions or to complete study visits Every effort should be made to obtain information on patients who withdraw from the study. The primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. However, patients will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn. Patients who withdraw from the study will not be replaced. 4.6.2 Study Treatment Discontinuation Patients must discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the following: Ongoing p regnancy or breastfeeding (in case of pregnancy, tre atment should be interrupted, and the patient should be monitored for safety ; however, the patient can be re-started with the treatment after the pregnancy and breastfeeding period . During pregnancy and breastfeeding, the patient will continue to come for the regular schedule visits as per protocol and will perform all assessments except MRI). Life-threating IRR or serious hypersensitivity reaction Active hepatitis B infection PML Active tuberculosis, either new onset or reactivation The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. Patient discontinuing the study treatment prematurely will be further monitored in a safety follow -up (see Section 3.1 .4). Patients who discontinue study treatment prematurely will not be replaced. 4.6.3 Study and Site Discontinuation The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study at any time. Reasons for terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the follow ing: The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a potential health hazard to patients. Patient enrollment is unsatisfactory. The Sponsor will notify the investigator if the S ponsor decides to discontinue the study. The Sponsor has the right to close a site at any time. Reasons for closing a site may include, but are not limited to, the following: Excessively slow recruitment Poor protocol adherence Inaccurate or incomplete data recording Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 59/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Non-compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) No study activity (i.e., all patients have completed the study and all obligations have been fulfilled) 4.6.4 End of study treatment At the end of the study treatment the patients will be encouraged to be included in a separate LTE study to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of their DMT treatment, and this is independent of the DMT. This LTE will also aim to evaluate the relationship between the primary endpoint of this study and long -term outcome. Patients who discontinue treatment early will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the Early Treatment Discontinuation Visit . Patients who complete the 96 weeks Treatment Period and, in agreement with their treating neurologist, decide not to continue in a sep arate LTE study, will be followed up for at least 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period. (see Section 3.1.4). Patients who decide to leave the study and switch to commercially marketed Ocrelizumab , eith er after completion of the 96 weeks Treatment Period or after early discontinuation of the 96 weeks Treatment Period, will not enter the safety Follow -up Period. 5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY 5.1 SAFETY PLAN Ocrelizumab is currently in clinical development for the treatment of MS. Identified and potential risks associated with ocrelizumab treatment will continue to be closely monitored throughout the clinical program. Patient safety during the ocrelizumab program is ens ured by targeting the most appropriate patient population, stringent safety monitoring by the Sponsor, and protocol -specified ocrelizumab treatment interruption criteria. Patients will be evaluated clinically and with standard laboratory tests before and at regular intervals during their participation in this study. Safety evaluations will consist of medical interviews, recording of adverse events, physical ex aminations, and standard laboratory measurements. Adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v4.0. Administration of ocrelizumab will be performed in a hospital, clinic environment or doctor's office/practice under close supervision of the investigator or a medically qualified staff member with immediate avai lability of full resuscitation facilities. All adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded during the study and until 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period as provided through this study. Safety assessments will include the incide nce, nature, and severity of (serious) adverse events graded per the NCI CTCAE v4.0. Safety assessments will be conducted per the schedule of assessments in Appendix 1 . Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 60/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 The potential safety issues anticipated in this study, as well as measures intended to avoid or minimize these issues, are outlined in the following sections. 5.1.1 Risks Associated with Ocrelizumab 5.1.1.1 Identified Risks and Adverse Drug Reactions Infusion -Related Reactions (IRRs) All CD20 depleting age nts administered via the intravenous route, including ocrelizumab have been associated with acute IRRs. Following the approved administration regimen (which includes the use of premedication prior to treatment with ocrelizumab in order to reduce frequency and severity of IRRs), symptoms of IRRs may occur during any ocrelizumab infusion but have been more frequently reported during the first infusion. Physicians should alert patients that IRRs can occur within 24 hours of the infusion. Across the RMS and PPM S trials, symptoms associated with IRRs included, but were not limited to: pruritus, flushing, hypotensi on, pyrexia, fatigue, headache, dizziness, nausea and tachycardia. Patients should be observed for at least one hour after the completion of the infusion for any symptom of IRR. They will be informed about the possibility of delayed post -infusion symptoms and instructed to cont act their study physi cian if they develop such symptoms. Hypotension, as a symptom of IRR, may occur during ocrelizumab infusions. Therefore, withholding of antihypertensive treatments should be considered for 12 hours prior to and throughout each ocrelizumab infusion. Infect ions Infection is an identified risk associated with ocrelizumab treatment, predominantly involving mild to moderate respiratory tract infections. Non-disseminated herpes virus - associated infections, mostly mild to moderate, were also reported more frequ ently with ocrelizumab (approximately 5 to 6%, simplex and zoster) than with comparators (approximately 3%). During the controlled period of the pivotal trials, the proportion of patients with serious infections in RMS was lower in the ocrelizumab group (1.3%) than in the interferon beta - 1a group (2.9%); in PPMS, the proportion of patients with serious infections, was similar in both groups: 6.7% in the placebo group compared with 6.2% in the ocrelizumab group Serious, opportunistic and fatal infections h ave occurred in patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with ocrelizumab in Phase III clinical trials. Data from completed studies regarding infection risks with ocrelizumab treatment in these patient populations are provided in the Ocrel izumab IB. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 61/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 No opportunistic infections were reported by any MS patient treated with ocrelizumab during the controlled period of the pivotal trials . In interventional clinical studies there were no reports of hepatitis B reactivation in MS patients treated with ocrelizumab, but it had been reported in one RA patient treated with ocrelizumab. HBV screening should be performed in all patients before initiation of treatment with ocrelizumab as per local guidelines. Patients with active Hepatitis B Virus should not be treated with ocrelizumab. Patients with positive serology should consult liver disease experts before start of treatment and should be monitored and managed following local medical standards to prevent Hepatitis B reactivation. Delay ocrelizumab ad ministration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. For PML see \"Potential risks\" below. Decrease in immunoglobulins Treatment with ocrelizumab resulted in a decrease in total immunoglobulins (Ig) over the controlled period o f the studies , mainly driven by reduction in IgM, with no observed association with serious infections during the controlled periods . The proportion of patients with decrease in Igs below LLN increased over time and with successive dosing. Based on additio nal patient exposure, in cases of continuous decrease over time, a higher risk of serious infection cannot be ruled out (see below in potential risks section). Delayed return of peripheral B cells Treatment with ocrelizumab leads to rapid depletion of CD19+ B cells in blood by 14 days post treatment (first time -point of assessment) as an expected pharmacologic effect. This was sustained throughout the treatment period. The longest follow up time after the last ocrelizumab infusion from Phase II Study WA21493 in 51 patients, indicates that the median time to repletion (returned to baseline/LLN whichever occurred first of B cells was 72 weeks (range 27 175 weeks). Patients with prolonged B -cell deple tion should be monitored until their B -cells have repleted. Impaired Response to Vaccination After treatment with ocrelizumab over 2 years in pivotal clinical trials, the proportion of patients with positive antibody titers against streptococcus pneumoniae, mumps, rubella, and varicella were generally similar to the proportions at baseline. The results of the randomized, open -label Phase IIIb study (BN29739) that assessed if ocrelizumab recipients with RMS raise adequate humoral responses to selec ted vaccines indicate that patients treated with ocrelizumab were able to mount humoral responses, albeit decreased, to toxoid, 23 limpet hemocyanin neoantigen, and seasonal influenza vaccines. The result s are summarized in the current version of the IB. Physicians should review the immunization status of patients being considered for treatment with ocrelizumab. Patients who require vaccination should complete it at least 6 weeks prior to initiation of oc relizumab. For seasonal influenza vaccines, it is still recommended to vaccinate patients on ocrelizumab. Vaccination with live or live - attenuated vaccines are not recommended during the treatment with ocrelizumab and until B cells have returned to normal levels. Due to the potential depletion of B -cells in neonates and infants of mothers, who have been exposed to ocrelizumab during pregnancy, it is recommended that vaccination with live or live -attenuated vaccines should be delayed until B -cells have reco vered; therefore, measuring CD19 -positive B cell level, in neonates and infants, prior to vaccination is recommended. It is recommended that all vaccinations other than live or live -attenuated should follow the local immunization schedule and measurement of vaccine -induced response titers should be considered to check whether individuals can mount a protective immune response because the efficacy of the vaccination may be decreased. 5.1.1.2 Potential Risks PML PML is an important potential risk for ocrelizuma b and it has only been reported with ocrelizumab where the risk for PML was preexisting, specifically from prior immunosuppressive treatment (e.g. natalizumab or fingolimod treatment) . In all of these PML cases, the causality with ocrelizumab was not consi dered plausible. Based on the available information, it is reasonable to consider that the PML started before the first administration of ocrelizumab, given new symptom onset and/or MRI changes had already occurred on the previous therapy or during the was h out period, and was related to prior immunosuppressive treatment. Physicians should be vigilant for early signs and symptoms of PML, which can include any new onset, or worsening of neurological signs or symptoms as these can be similar to an MS relapse. If PML is suspected, dosing with ocrelizumab must be withheld. Evaluation of PML, including MRI, confirmatory CSF testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should be considered. If PML is confirmed, ocrelizumab must be discontinued per manently. Please refer to Appendix 6 for guidance for diagnosis of PML. Please see the IB for more details. Serious infections related to decrease in immunoglobulins (particularly in patients previously exposed to immunosuppressive/ immunomodulatory drugs or with pre -existing hypogammaglobulinaemia) Based on additional patient exposure an apparent association between decrease in immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM) and serious infections with ocrelizumab treatment was observed. There was no difference in the pattern (type, lat ency, duration, outcome) of Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 63/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 the serious infections reported in this subset of patients compared to the overall serious infections profile. In addition, risk factors for a subset of patients at high er risk of serious infections could n ot be identified. Hypersensitivity reactions No hypersensitivity reactions to ocrelizumab were reported in the controlled clinical trials. Hypersensitivity may be difficult to distinguish from IRRs in terms of symptoms. A hypersensitivity reaction may present during any infusion, although typically would not present during the first infusion. For subsequent infusions, more severe symptoms than previously experienced, or new severe symptoms, should prompt consi deration of a potential hypersensitivity reaction. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected during infusion , the infusion must be stopped immediately and permanently. Patients with known IgE -mediated hypersensitivity to ocrelizumab must not be treated. Malignancies including Breast Cancer Patients should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines. Please see the IB for more details. Neutropenia In the controlled treatment period, decreased neutrophils were observed in 12 to 15% of MS patients treated with ocrelizumab, in PPMS and RMS respectively. Most were mild to moderate in severity, and approximately 1% of the patients had Grade 3 or 4 neutro penia; no temporal association with infections was identified. Based on additional patient exposure, an association between neutropenia and serious infections with ocrelizumab treatment was not observed. Additional information can be found in the current I B. 5.1.2 Risks Associated with Corticosteroids The adverse reactions of corticosteroids may result from unwanted glucocorticoid actions, or from inhibition of the hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal axis. Please refer to local Prescribing Information. 5.1.3 Risks Associated with Antihistamines The adverse reactions depend on the sedating properties of the antihistamine and include but are not limited to nausea, drowsiness, headaches, dry mouth, and allergic reactions such as rash. Please refer to local Prescribing Information. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 64/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 5.1.4 Management of Patients Who Experience Specific Adverse Events Guidelines for management of specific adverse events are outlined in Table 2. Additional guidelines are provided in the subsections below. Table 2 Guidelines for Management of Specific Adverse Events Event Action to Be Taken Mild to moderate IRR If the event that a patient experiences is a mild to moderate IRR (e.g. headache), the infusion rate should be reduced to half the rate at the time of the event. This reduced rate should be maintained for at least 30 minutes. If tolerated, the infusio n rate may then be increased according to the patient's initial infusion schedule. Severe IRR (or complex of flushing, fever, and throat pain) If a patient experiences a severe IRR or a complex of flushing, fever, and throat pain symptoms, the infusion s hould be interrupted immediately, and the patient should receive symptomatic treatment. The infusion should be re -started only after all symptoms have resolved. The initial infusion rate at restart should be half of the infusion rate at the time of onset of the reaction. Life-threatening or disabling IRR (e.g., anaphylaxis) Immediately stop ocrelizumab if there are signs of a life - threatening or disabling IRR during an infusion, such as acute hypersensitivity or acute respiratory distress syndrome. The patient should receive appropriate treatment. Permanently discontinue ocrelizumab in these patients. hr = hour; IRR = infusion -related reaction 5.2 SAFETY PARAMETERS AN D DEFINITIONS Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events, including serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest, performing protocol -specified safety laboratory assessments, measurin g protocol -specified vital signs, and conducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical t o the safety evaluation of the study. Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in Section 5.4 Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 65/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 5.2.1 Adverse Events According to the ICH guideline for GCP, an adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, regardles s of causal attribution. An adverse event can therefore be any of the following : Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in Section 5.3.5.10 Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., X -ray) that is associated wi th symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invasive procedures such as biopsi es) 5.2.2 Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria: Is fatal (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death) Is life threatening (i.e., the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the patient at immediate risk of death) This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death. Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.11 ) Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i. e., the adverse event results in substantial disruption of the p atient's ability to conduct normal life functions) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to study drug Is a significant medical event in the investi gator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above) The terms \"severe\" and \"serious\" are not synonymous. Severity refers to the intensity of an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to NCI CTCAE; see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as severe headache without any further findings). Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 66/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event recorded on the eCRF. Serious adverse events are required to b e reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for repor ting instructions). 5.2.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable to the Sponsor) Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following: Cases of potential d rug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in comb ination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy's law (see Section 5.3.5.7 ). Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug, as defined below: Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laborato ry findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product. This term applies only when a contamination of the study drug is suspected. 5.3 METHODS AND TIMING F OR CAPTURING AND ASS ESSING SAFETY PARAMETERS The invest igator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1 for definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4, Section 5.5 and Section 5.6. For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 for seriousness criteria), severity (see Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ). 5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period Investig ators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact. All adverse events, whet her reported by the patient or noted by study personnel, will be recorded in the patient's medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF. After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 67/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting serious adverse events). After initiation of study drug , all adverse events will be reported until 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period , but may be extended in patients whose B-cells take longer to replete. Related SAEs must be collected and reported regardless of the time elapsed from the last study drug administration, even if the study has been closed. Instructions for reporting adverse events that occur after the adverse event reporting period are provided in Section 5.6. 5.3.2 Eliciting Adverse Event Information A consistent methodology of non -directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting adverse event information at all patient evaluation time points. E xamples of non-directive questions include the following: \"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?\" \"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?\" 5.3.3 Assessment of Severity of Adverse Events The adverse event severity gr ading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v4.0) will be used for assessing adverse event severity. Table 3 will be used for assessing severity for infusion rela ted reactions and adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 68/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Table 3 Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale for IRRs and Other Events Not Specifically Listed in NCI CTCAE Grade Severity 1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; or intervention not indicated 2 Moderate; minimal, local, or non -invasive intervention indicated; or limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living a 3 Severe or medically significant, but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or limiting self-care activities of daily living b,c 4 Life-threatening consequences or urgent intervention indicated d 5 Death related to adverse event d NCI CTCAE = National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events . Note: Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE (v4.0), which can be found at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic applications/ctc.htm a Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc. b Examples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who are not bedridden. c If an event is assessed as a \"significant medical event,\" it must be reported as a serious adverse event (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructi ons), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 . d Grade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 5.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to d etermine whether an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating \"yes\" or \"no\" accordingly. The following guidance s hould be taken into consideration (see also Table 4): Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (a s applicable) Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments Known association of the event with the disease under study Presence of risk factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurrence of the event Presence of non -treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the occurrence of the event. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 69/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Table 4 Causal Attribution Guidance Is the adverse event suspected to be caused by the study drug o n the basis of facts, evidence, science -based rationales, and clinical judgment? YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and administration of the study drug, and the adverse event cannot be readily explained by the patient 's clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the adverse event follows a known pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the adverse event abates or resolves upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re -challenge. NO An adverse event will be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below . Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temp oral relationship to administration of the study drug (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after first dose of study drug). For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for each protocol -mandated therapy. 5.3.5 Procedures for Recording Adverse Events Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on t he Adverse Event eCRF. Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations. Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.3.5.1 Infusion -Related Reactions Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration and are judged to be related to study drug infusion should be captured as a diagnosis (e.g., \"infusion -related reaction\" or \"anaphylactic reaction\") on the Adverse Event eC RF. If possible, avoid ambiguous terms such as \"systemic reaction.\" Assoc iated signs and symptoms should be recorded on the dedicated Infusion -Related Reaction eCRF. Investigators should consider a loca l IRR for any symptoms affecting the skin and localized to only one place. Any other IRR should be considered as systemic. If a patient experiences both a local and systemic reaction to the same dose of study drug, each reaction should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, wit h signs and sympt oms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infus ion-Related Reaction eCRF. 5.3.5.2 Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual si gns and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases) . However, if a constellation signs Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 70/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a diagnosis is subsequently establ ished, all previously reported adverse events based o n signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one adverse event report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first symptom of the eventual diagnosis. 5.3.5.3 Adverse Events That Are Secondary to Other Events In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g ., cascade events or clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or seriou s secondary events. A medically significant secondary adverse event that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse Eve nt eCRF. For example: If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF. If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF. If neutropenia is accom panied by an infection, both events should be reported separately on the eCRF. All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is unclear as to whether the events are associated. 5.3.5.4 Persistent or Recurrent Adverse Events A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between patient evaluation time points. Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF. The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be record ed at the time the event is first reported. If a persistent adverse event becomes more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; se e Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions). The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by changing the event from \"non -serious\" to \"serious,\" providing the date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to serious adverse events. A recurrent a dverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation time points and subsequently recurs. Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Eve nt eCRF. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 71/Protocol MA30005, Version 5.3.5.5 Abnormal Laboratory Values Not every laboratory abnorma lity qualifies as an adverse event. A laboratory test result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinically significant in the investigator's judgment It is the investigator's responsibility to review all laboratory findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with cholestasis), only the diagnosis (i.e., cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., \"elevated potassium,\" as opposed to \"abnormal potassium \"). If the laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the adverse event. For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as \"hyp erkalemia.\" Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for details on recording persistent adverse events). 5.3.5.6 Abnormal Vital Sign Values Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event. A vital sign result must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any o f the following criteria: Is accompanied by clinical symptoms Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation) Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy Is clinica lly significant in the investigator's judgment It is the investigator's responsibility to review all vital sign findings. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality should be classified as an adverse event. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 72/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. Observations of the same clinically s ignificant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for details on re cording persistent adverse events). 5.3.5.7 Abnormal Liver Function Tests The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3 ULN) in combination with either an elevated total bilirubin ( 2 ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as defined by Hy's law). Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the occurrence of either of th e following: Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3 ULN in combination with total bilirubin 2 ULN Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3 ULN in combination with clinical jaundice The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event e CRF (see Section 5.3.5.2 ) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event ), either as a serious adverse event or an adverse event of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.3.5.8 Deaths All deaths that occur during the proto col-specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the Adverse Eve nt eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2 ). This includes death attributed to progression of RRMS. Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinc t event. The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal o utcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF. Generally, only one such event should be reported. The term \"sudden death\" should be used only fo r the occurrence of an abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or without preexisting heart disease, within 1 hour after the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the pat ient was last seen alive and stable. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, \"unexplained death\" should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), \"unexplained death\" should be replaced by the established cause of death. If the death is attributed to progression of RRMS , \"RRMS progress ion\" should be recorded on the eCRF. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 5.3.5.9 Preexisting Medical Conditions A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study. Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only if the frequency, severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study. When recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept that the preexi sting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., \"more frequent headaches\"). 5.3.5.10 Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progressi on of the underlying disease, such as MS relapses or disability worsening should not be recorded as adverse events. These data will be captured as efficacy assessme nt data only. In most ca ses, the expected pattern of progression will be based on EDSS score. In rare cases, the determination of clinical progression will be based on symptomatic deterioration. However, every effort should be made to document progression through use of objecti ve criteria. If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event. Occasional isolated symptoms that according to the investigator are caused by MS, but do not constitute a full MS re lapse, should be reported as an AE, with the causality \"Disease under study\" (see Section 5.3.4 ). 5.3.5.11 Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization Any adverse event that results in hospitalization (i.e., in -patien t admission to a hospital) or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined below. The following hospitalization scenarios are not considered to be adverse events: Hospitalization for respite care Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria are met: The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled during the study when elective surgery became necessary because of the expected normal progre ssion of the dis ease The patient has not experienced an adverse event Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 74/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 The following hospitalization scenarios are not considered to be serious adverse events, but should be reported as adverse events instead: Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours. Elective hospitalizations or surgical procedures that are a result of a patient's pre - existing condition(s) that have not worsened since receiving trial medication. Exampl es may include, but are not limited to, cholecystectomy for gallstones, and diagnostic testing. Such events should still be recorded as medical procedures in the \"Surgeries and therapies\" eCRF. Hospitalization to receive trial medication such as infusions of ocrelizumab unless this is prolonged (more than 24 hours). Hospitalization following an MS relapse as long as the reason for hospitalization is to receive standard treatment with i.v. methylprednisolone. For a list of serious ADRs that are considered e xpected, kindly refer to the current IB. 5.3.5.12 Adverse Events Associated with an Overdose or Error in Drug Administration An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the dose being studied. An overdose or incorrect admin istration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event. All adverse events associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Even t eCRF. If the associated a dverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). Adverse events associated with an overdose of ocrelizumab in previous clinical studies include IRRs and infection. 5.3.5.13 Patient -Reported Outcome Data Adverse event reports will not be derived from PRO data by the Sponsor, and safety analyses will not be performed using PRO data. However, if any PRO responses suggestive of a possible adverse event are identified during site review of the PRO data, the investigator will determine whether the criteria for an adverse event have been met and, if so, will report the event on the Adverse Event eCRF. 5.4 IMMEDIATE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM INVESTIGATOR TO SPON SOR Certain events require immediate reporting to all ow the Sponsor to take appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial. The investigator must report Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 75/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take place more than 24 hours after the investigat or learns of the event. The following is a list of events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study drug: Serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2 for further details) Adverse events of special interest (see Section 5.4.2 for further details) Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for further details) The investigator must report ne w significant follow -up information for these events to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the information). New significant information includes the following: New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis Significant new diagnostic test results Change in causality based on new information Change in the event's outcome, including recovery Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse events to the local health authority and IRB/EC. 5.4.1 Emergency Medical Contacts To ensure the safety of study patients, an Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will access the Roche Medical Emergency List, escalat e emergency medical calls, provide medical translation service (if necessary), connect the investigator with a Roche Med ical Responsible (listed above and/or on the Roche Medical Emergency List), and track all calls. The Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will be available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Toll -free numbers for the Help Desk, as well as Medical Moni tor and Medical Responsible contact information, will be distributed to all investigators. 5.4.2 Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse E vents and Adverse Events of Special Interest 5.4.2.1 Events That Occur prior to Study Drug Initiation After informed consent has been obtained but prior to init iation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be r eported. The Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 76/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 5.4.2.2 Events That Occur after Study Drug Initiation After initiation of study drug, serious adverse events will be reported until 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period . Investigators should record all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after learning of the event) on the Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the electronic data capture (EDC) system. A report will be generated and sent to Roche Safety Risk Management by the EDC system In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to inve stigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee imm ediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators. Once the EDC system is available, all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system. Related SAEs must be collected and reported regardless of the time elapsed from the last study drug administration, even if the study has been closed. Instructions for reporting post -study adverse events are provided in Section 5.6. 5.4.3 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies 5.4.3.1 Pregnancies in Female Patients Female patie nts of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 24 weeks after the last dose of study drug. A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and submit ted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators. Pregnancy should not be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. The investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fet us. Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregn ancy. Any serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF. In additio n, the investigator will submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available. For pregnancies occurring in female patients who have been exposed to Ocrelizumab at any time during pregnancy or within six months prior to conception, pregnancy outcome and the health status of the child will be followed until the child is one year of age. Data collection is voluntary only; it does not include any interventions or invasive proced ures. A Pregnancy Outcome and Infant Health Information on First Year of Life questionnaire will be submitted to Health Authorities and IRB/IECs for their approval, along with the infant data release consent form. The data will be reported on dedicated pre gnancy Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 77/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 outcome and infant health information paper form, hence will not be entered in the eCRF. 5.4.3.2 Abortions Any abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as the Sponsor considers abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). Any a bortion should be reported in the same fashion (as the Sponsor considers abortions to be medically significant). 5.4.3.3 Congenital Anomalies/Birth Defects Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study drug should be clas sified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF PATIENT S AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS 5.5.1 Investigator Follow -Up The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable b y the inve stigator, the patient is lost to follow -up, or the patient withdraws consent. Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures until a final outcome can be report ed. During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient's medical record to facilitate source data verification. All pregnancies reported in patients during the study should be followed with a Pregnancy Outcome and Infant Health Information on First Year of life questionnaire. 5.5.2 Sponsor Follow -Up For serious adverse events, and pregnancies, the Sponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, and/or a moni toring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case. 5.6 POST -STUDY ADVERSE E VENTS The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious and non-serious adverse event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as 96 weeks after the end of the Treatment Period ), if the event is believed to b e related to prior study drug treatment. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 78/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 The investigator should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form using the f ax number or email address provided to investigators. 5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIE S, INVESTIGATORS, INSTI TUTIONAL REVIEW BOAR DS, AND ETHICS COMMITTEES The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events and adverse events of specia l interest against cumulative product experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, and applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation. To determine reporting requirements for single a dverse event cases, the Sponsor will assess the expect edness of these events using the following reference document: Ocrelizumab IB The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference document. Reporting r equirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed. Certain adverse events are anticipated to occur in the study population at some frequency independent of study drug exposure and will be excluded from expedited reporting. These anticipated events include, but are not limited to, the following: Infection Infusion related reactions 6. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS AND ANALYSIS PLAN The analysis of this single -arm non -comparative study will be exploratory and primarily based on descriptive statistical methods. Unless otherwise specified, statistical tests will be two -sided and the statist ical significance level will be 5%. Corresponding 95% CIs will be presented as appropriate. Although multiple statistical tests may be conducted, no adjustments to the Type 1 error rate will be made. For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation [SD], n, 25th and 75th percentiles, minimum, and maximum) will be calculated and summarized. For categorical variables, the number and percentage in each category will be displayed. Full details of all statistical issues and planned statistical analyses will be specified in a separate Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP), which will be finalized prior to the locking of the study database and may include further exploratory analyses not Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 79/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 explicitly described in this section, as w ell as analyses of data from the study phase beyond the main 96 -week study period. Analysis populations The efficacy and safety analyses will be performed using the intent -to-treat (ITT) population. The per -protocol (PP) population will be used for support ive efficacy analyses of the primary endpoint and selected secondary endpoints in order to evaluate the influence of major protocol violators on key efficacy endpoints. Intent -to-Treat Population All en rolled patients who received any dose of ocrelizumab will be included in the ITT population. Patients who prematurely withdrew from the study for any reason and who did not perform any assessment for any reason will still be included in the ITT population. Per-Protocol Population The per -protocol population will consist of the subset of the ITT population defined as all patients who had 96 weeks of treatment and who did not have any major protocol violations that are deemed to potentially affect the effic acy and safety endpoints. The list of criteria leading to exclusion from the per -protocol population will be finalized prior to database closure and documented in the SAP. 6.1 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE With a sample size of 750 patients, an observed NEDA rate of 30% will be estimated with a precision (half -width of the 95% CI around the estimate) of 3.3% based on the Clopper -Pearson method, i.e. the 95% CI will be (26.7%, 33.4%). Even if the NEDA rate is different from the assumed rate of 30%, with the pro posed sample size the precision of the estimate will r emain better than 3.6% (value for a NEDA rate of 50%). The annualized relapse rate is another relevant outcome measure assessed in this study. Based on results from the pivotal Phase III studies WA21092 (Opera I) and WA21093 (Opera II), in this study the adjusted annualized relapse rate assessed over two years is expected to be estimated with a preci sion of approximately 0.03. 6.2 SUMMARIES OF CONDUCT OF STUDY Enrollment, ocrelizumab administration, and discontinuations from the study will be summarized. Patient disposition and the incidence of treatment discontinuation for reasons other than disease progression will be tabulated. Major protocol violations, including violations of inclusion/exclusion cr iteria, will also be summarized . Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 80/Protocol MA30005, Version 6.3 SUMMARIES OF DEMOGRA PHIC AND BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS Patients' demographics (age, gender, and self -reported race), medical history and neurological examination will be summarized. The following will also be summarized: MS disease history (duration since first MS symptoms, du ration of MS since diagnosis, relapses in the past year) and MS treatment history, baseline measures of MRI, EDSS and other important variables. 6.4 EFFICACY ANALYSES 6.4.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint The pri mary efficacy endpoint will be the proportion of patients who have no evidence of disease activity (NEDA), as per protocol defined events during a 96 -week period. The 8 weeks MRI scan will be the baseline for MRI activity. The definition of a protocol -defined event of disease activity is t he occurrence of at least one of the following while on treatment with ocrelizumab: A protocol -defined relapse as defined in Section 4.5.4 24 weeks confirmed d isability progression based on increases in EDSS while on treatment with ocrelizumab A T1 Gd -enhanced and/or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesion on MRI after Week 8 compared to the Week 8 MRI scan. 6.4.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The secondary objective for this study is to evaluate the efficacy of ocrelizumab 600 mg IV given every 24 weeks on the basis of the endpoints and analyses listed in Section 2.1.2 . 6.4.3 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints The exploratory efficacy objective for this study is to further assess the efficacy of ocrelizumab 600 mg IV given every 24 weeks by monitoring PROs related to Qo L, treatment satisfaction, and other endpoints and analyses as listed in Section 2.1.3 . 6.4.4 Analysis Methods The analysis will be performed after the last CDP and CDI confirmation visit. The per - protocol popu lation will be used for supportive efficacy analyses of the primary endpoint. The evaluation o f the clinical efficacy of ocrelizumab will be based upon the events in - between baseline visit and week 96. The MRI activity is evaluated from week 8 to week Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 81/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 96. The proportion of patients free from protocol -defined events up to Week 96 (i.e. patients with NEDA) will be calculated and the corresponding two -sided Clopper - Pearson 95 % CI will be presented. Logistic regression models will be used to identify predictors of response to treatment (freedom from events). Variables that will be considered include: re gion, line of treatment (previous DMTs), gender, and baseline EDSS. In addition, specific efficacy endpoints, such as CDP, will be compared between patients with or without evidence of disease activity up to Week 96. Details about the missing data handling, as well as sensitivity analyses, will be specified in the statistical analysis plan. The proportion of patients free from a protocol -defined event up to Week 24 , 48, and 96 will be calculated and the corresponding two -sided Clopper -Pearson 95% CI will be presented. Logistic regression models will be used to identify predictors of response to treatment (freedom from events). Variables that will be considered inclu de: region, line of treatment (previous DMTs), gender, and baseline EDSS. The annualized relapse rate by Week 96 will be analyzed using regression based on a negative binomial model, adjusting for factors that may include region, baseline EDSS ( 4.0 vs 4.0), line of treatment (previous DMTs), with the log -transformed drug exposure time in years as an \"offset\" variable. The adjusted annualized relapse rate will be presented. EDSS and its change from baseline, as well as other continuous variables such a s the change in total T2 lesion volume and the key PROs, will be summarized descriptively at each assessment visit. The time course of these variables will be described using techniques such as linear mixed models for repeated measures (MMRM) adjusting for covariates such as the respective baseline score, geographical region, and baseline EDSS. The Kaplan -Meier method will be used to estimate the survival function for time -to-event data (e.g., time to onset of first relapse; time to onset of sustained disability progression for at least 12 weeks ) and Cox proportional hazards regression will be used to identify predictors of survival. Variables to be included in the regression model will be the same as those used in the logistic regression described above. Further details will be specified in the SAP. The total number of T1 Gd -enhanced lesions will be calculated as the sum of the individual number of T1 Gd -enhanced lesions at Weeks 24, 48 and 96. Data from unscheduled assessments will not be included in this summary or analysis. A negative binomial model will be used to estimate the rate of lesion occurrence. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 82/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 6.5 SAFETY ANALYSES 6.5.1 Safety Outcome Measures The safety outcome measures comp rise the following: the incidence and nature of all adverse events, including findings on vital sign measurements, physical and neurological examinations, clinical laboratory tests, locally reviewed MRI for safety (non -MS CNS pathology), and concomitant medic ations. 6.5.2 Safety Analyses Safety will be assessed through summaries of adverse events (including rates/incidence rates and corresponding 95% CIs) and clinical laboratory abnormalities. All adverse events occurring on or after treatment on Day 1 will be cod ed, summarized by NCI CTCAE v4.0 grade, and tabulated by body system and Preferred Term for individual adverse events within each body system. Grade 3 to 5 adverse events, serious adverse events, adverse events leading to t reatment discontinuation, time t o withdrawal from the study due to an adverse event, first adverse event leading to infusion adjust ment, and time to first selected treatment -related adverse event will be summa rized. In addition, all serious adverse events and deaths will be listed. Asso ciated laboratory parameters, such as hepatic function, renal function, and hematology values, will be grouped and presented together. Ocrelizumab exposure will be summarized, including duration and dosage. 6.6 SUBGROUP ANALYSIS Subgroup analysis will b e done based upon First or second switch Previous treatments Age of subjects ( 40 years, > 40 years) Disease severity at inclusion and in disease history: o EDSS at baseline ( < EDSS 2.5, EDSS 2.5) o Number of relapses over the year prior to inclusion ( 1, >1 ) o MRI activity at baseline (number of T1 Gd+, 2, > 2) 6.7 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA Details about the missing data handling will be specified in statistical analysis plan Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 83/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 6.8 INTERIM ANALYSIS No formal confirmatory efficacy interim analyses are planned. Exploratory analyses of selected endpoints may be performed during the course of the study, e.g. after all patients have completed the first 6 and 12 months of the treatment phase and the necessary data are available. 7. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT 7.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE A contract research organization (CRO) will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking of the data. Data entered manually will be collected via EDC through use of eCRFs. Sites will be responsible for da ta entry into the EDC system. In the event of discrepant data, the CRO will requ est data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system. The CRO will produce a Data Quality Plan that describes the quality check ing to be performed on the data. The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, including approval of the CRO's data managem ent plans and specifications. Data will be periodically transferred electronically from the CRO to the Sponsor, and the Sponsor's standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data. Central imaging review data wil l be sent directly to the Sponsor, using the Sponsor's standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data. eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system's audit trail. System backups for data stored at the Sponsor and records retention for the study data will be consistent with the Sponsor's standard procedures. PRO data will be collected on paper questionnaires. The data from the PRO questionnaires as well as the BICAMS scoring data received from the central reader will be entered into the EDC system by site staff. 7.2 ELECTRONIC CASE REPO RT FORMS eCRF s are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system. Sites will re ceive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion. eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in accordance with instructions from the CRO. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 84/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff. eCRFs should be reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee. At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a readable format on a compact disc that must be kept with the s tudy records. Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is re quired. 7.3 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENT ATION Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to con firm that critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by autho rized site personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time. They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient -reported outcomes, evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or m agnetic media, X -rays, patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico -techni cal departments involved in a clinical trial. Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e. , no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data. Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the pol icy for retention of records described in Section 7.5. To facilitate source data verification, the investigators and institutions must provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and reports for trial -related monitoring, Spo nsor audits, and IRB/EC review. The study site must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities. 7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site's computerized medical record system (i.e., in lieu o f original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research. An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry of data. If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the pers on making the ch ange, and date of the change.

Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 97/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 e Vital signs will include the measurements of heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and oral or auricular temperature while the patient is in a seated position. Vital signs should be taken within 45 minutes prior to the premedication methylprednisolone infusion. In addition , vital signs should be obtained prior to the ocrelizumab infusion then every 15 minutes ( 5 minutes) for the first hour, followed by every 30 minutes (\u00b1 10 minutes) until 1 hour after the end of the infusion. Record abnormalities observed before enrollment on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. At sub sequent visits, record new or worsened clinically significant abnormalities on the Adverse Event eCRF. f Hematology will include hemoglobin, hematocrit, RBCs, WBC absolute and differential, ANC, and quantitative platelet count. C hemistry will include AST, ALT, GGT, creatinine, total bilirubin, random glucose, potassium and sodium. Urine dipstick will be done at site locally. g Serum b -hCG must be performed at screening in women of childbearing potential. Subsequently, urine -hCG (sensitivity 25 mIU/mL) must be collected. On infusion visits, the urine pregnancy test should be performed prior to m ethylprednisolone infusion in all women of childbearing potential. If positive, ocrelizumab should be withheld. The FSH test is only applicable to confirm post menopausal status in female patients. h All patients must have negative HBsAg result and negative HepCAb screening tests prior to enrollment. If total HBcAb is posi tive at screening, HBV DNA measured by PCR must be negative in order for a patient to be el igible for the study. For enrolled patients with negative HBsAg and positive total HBcAb, HBV DNA (by PCR) must be repeated every 24 weeks. i Lymphocytes subtypes samples should be collected prior to ocrelizumab infusion to screen for CD19+ and T -cell counts (CD4+, CD8+) at a local laboratory. j Plasma samples for anti -JCV antibodies should be taken at baseline and repeated yearly and end of study for storage in a central laboratory. Samples will be analyzed upon request. k Patients must have an EDSS sc ore of 0.0 to 4.0 points, inclusive at screening to be eligible. EDSS needs to be confirmed after 24 weeks if EDSS changes from baseline to Week 96 l Neurological examinations will be used to distinguish relapse in MS from another neurological (non -MS) disorder. Potential relapses should be recorded throughout the treatment period. Investigators will also screen patients for signs and sy mptoms of PML by evaluating neurological deficits localized to the cerebral cortex, such as cortical symptoms/signs, behavioral and neuropsychological symptoms/signs (e.g., gait abnormalitie s, limb incoordination). Patients with suspected PML should be withheld from ocrelizumab treatment until PML is rule d out by complete clinical evaluation and appropriate diagnostic testing. A patient with confirmed PML should be withdrawn fro m the study. m After initiation of study drug, a ll adverse events should be reported until 96 weeks after the end of the Treatm ent Period but may be extended in patients whose B-cells take longer to replete . After this period, the investigator should report any serious and non -serious adverse events that are believed to be related to prior study drug treatment (see Sections 5.3.1 and 5.6). n All patients must receive prophylactic treatment with 100 mg methylprednisolone, administered by slow IV infusion, to be completed approximately 30 minutes before the start of each ocrelizumab infusion, and an antihistaminic drug (e.g., diphenhydramine) approximately 30 - 60 minutes before each infusion of ocrelizumab . o Ocrelizumab will be administer ed as two 300 -mg IV infusions in 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride each on Days 1 and 15 and one 600 -mg infusion in 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride every subsequent dose (i.e., every 24 weeks) for a maximum of 72 weeks. It is anticipated that the patient wi ll need t o stay at the hospital or clinic for a full day for the infusion visits. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 98/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 p A structured telephone interview will be conducted by site personnel every 8 weeks (\u00b1 3 days) to identify and collect informa tion on any changes in the patient's health status that warrant an unscheduled visit (including new or worsening neurological symptoms) and possible events or infections. No telephone contact is needed in weeks where patient is performing on -site visits (week 24, 48, 72 and 96). q If the subject discontinues t reatment early, all efforts should be made to perform the Early study treatment discontinuation evaluation visit as soon as p ossible after discontinuation from treatment period. Otherwise, reasons for discontinuation will be captured via telephone call. r All efforts should be made to obtain the brain MRI scans before the next ocrelizumab infusion and the scans should be reviewe d locally for the presence of any non-MS pathology, including PML, before the next infusion is administered. s In case of re -screen ing, MRI does not need to be repeated if the MRI scan obtained at first screening is not older than 3 months. t Since CVLT -II is not yet available in all the languages of the countries participating in this study, the patients will not be assessed with this portion of the BICAMS. The patients will only need to complete the two components of the BICAMS test battery (Symbol Digit Modalities Test a nd Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised). Note: Lab samples can be taken up to 2 weeks prior to the schedule d study visit.

Version 5 Appendix 4: Telephone Interviews The purpose of this interview is to identify and collect information on any changes in the patient's health status that warrant an unsch eduled visit (including new or worsening neurological symptoms). Telephone interviews should be performed by study personnel every 8 weeks between clinic visits (see also Section 4.5.11 ) Please ask the following qu estions and record patient's answers during the Telephone Interview: Questions No Yes 1. Since your last visit or telephone interview, have you had any new or worsening medical problems (such as sudden changes in your thinking, alterations in your behavior, visual disturbances, extremity weakness, limb coordination problems, or gait abnormalities) that have persisted over more than one day? 2. Since your last visit or telephone interview, have you had any signs of an infection? 3. Since your last visit or telephone interview, have you had any other new or worsening medical problems or conditions (including pregnancy)? 4. Since your last visit or telephone interview, have you taken any new medicines (including medicines to treat cancer or MS, any other new medicines that weaken your immune system, or steroid medicines other than for the treatment of a recent relapse)? If the patient answered YES to any question, contact the Treating Investigator and review the patient's answers. The Invest igator can determine if an unscheduled visit is required. Please report all relevant information in the eCRF as well.

If MRI evaluation reveals lesions suspicious for PML (see Figure 5 ), a lumbar puncture with evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the detection of JC virus (JCV) DNA using a validated sensitive assay sho uld be undertaken. A diagnosis of PML can potentially be made by evaluating clinical and MRI findings plus the identification of JCV in the CSF. There is no known treatment or cure for PML. Treatment considerations are discussed in the medical literature (Calabrese et al. 2007) MRI Assessment Although there are no pathognomonic findings that differentiate PML from MS, a brain MRI scan that includes fluid -attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2 -weighted and T1 -weighted sequences, with and without gadolinium, should be performed to assess patients with neurological changes suggestive of PML (see Figure 5). Comparison with a baseline scan may assist with interpretation of the findings on the newly acquired MRI (see Table 5 for differences in lesion characteristics that may help differentiate between PML and MS). CSF Assessment The detection of JCV DNA in the CSF of a patient with clinical and MRI features suggestive of PML establishes the diagnosis of PML . If JCV DNA is not detected in CSF and if clinical suspicion of PML remains high, a repeat lumbar puncture should be performed. If diagnosis remains uncertain and suspicion of PML remains high, a brain biopsy may be considered to establish a definitive di agnosis. Ocrelizumab \u2014F.

Table 5 MRI Lesion Characteristics Typical of PML and MS Feature MS (relapse) PML Location of new lesions Mostly focal; affect entire brain and spinal chord, in white and possibly gray matter Diffuse lesions, mainly subcortical and rarely periventricular, located almost exclusively in whi te matter, although occasional extension to gray matter has been seen; posterior fossa frequently involved (cerebellum) Borders Sharp edges; mostly round or finger -like in shape (especially periventricular lesions), confluent with other lesions; U -fibers may be involved Ill-defined edges; irregular in shape; confined to white matter; sparing gray matter; pushing against the cerebral cortex; U -fibers destroyed. Mode of extension Initially focal; lesions enlarge within days or weeks and later decrease in si ze within months Lesions are diffuse and asymmetric, extending homogeneously; no confluence with other lesions; confined to white -matter tracks, sparing the cortex; continuous progression Mass effect Acute lesions show some mass effect No mass effect even in large lesions (but lesion slightly abuts cerebral cortex) On T2 -weighted lesions: hyperintense center, isointense ring, discrete hyperintensity outside the ring structure - Subacute and chronic lesions: hyperintense with no ring struc ture Diffuse hyperintensity, slightly increased intensity of newly involved areas compared with old areas, little irregular signal intensity of lesions. On T1 -weighted sequence Acute lesions: densely hypointense (large lesions) or isointense (small lesion s); increasing signal intensity over time in 80%; decreasing signal intensity (axonal loss) in about 20% Slightly hypointense at onset, with signal intensity decreasing over time and along the affected area; no reversion of signal intensity On FLAIR sequ ence Hyperintense, sharply delineated Hyperintensity more obvious; true abnormality more clearly visible than in T2 -weighted images With enhancement - Acute lesions: dense homogeneous enhancement, sharp edges - Subacute lesions: ring enhancement - Chronic lesions: no enhancement Usually no enhancement, even in large lesions; in patients with HIV, some peripheral enhancement is possible, especially under therapy.

In this study protocol the patient visits will occur every 6 months, site staff will conduct a phone int erview every 8 week in between the visits at site. Due to the low visit frequency patient diaries have been proposed as an optional tool to mitigate the risk related to AEs / concomitant medication low reporting. The decision to use the patient diary is left to the discretion of each PI. The PI must ensure that required EC/IRB approval was obtained before implementing the patient diary at his/her site. If you are using the patient diary, this is to be considered as patient source documentation. Please en sure the following process is followed at your site: The patient diary will be provided to the patient at the Baseline Visit. You or your site staff will explain to the patient when/how to complete it and remind him/her to bring it back at each visit at your site. Dispensing at Baseline and re -dispensing of patient diary at subsequent on -site visits should be documented in patie nt notes. Completed patient diaries should never be mailed to/ by patients. You or your site staff must review the completed patient diary at each visit and discuss the reported data with the patient. In between of the visit, you or your site staff shou ld discuss the patient diary and any updates made during the 8 -weeks telephone interviews. During each visit you or your site staff should make a copy of the completed patient diary, document your review and assessment, sign and date all pages and file it with the medical records In case you or your site staff cannot copy the patient diary, you would need to check the original during each patient study visits at site for any new adverse events / any new concomitant medication which occurred since last pat ient visit at site and document this in the patient notes (Source Data). When the patient early terminated or has completed the study, originals should be filed in the patient notes. To increase the patient compliance, please thank the patients for their time and effort and emphasize the importance of their contribution to the study to them. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 118/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 8: Summary of Product Characteristics for Disease Modifying Therapies for EMEA Countries Ocrelizumab 119/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 SmPC for Aubagio 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT AUBAGIO 14 mg film-coated tablets 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each film-coated tablet contains 14 mg of teriflunomide. Excipient with known effect : Each tablet contains 72 mg of lactose (as monohydrate). For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Film-coated tablet (tablet). Pale blue to pastel blue, pentagonal film-coated tablets with imprint on one side ('14') and engraved with a corporate logo on the other side. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications AUBAGIO is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). (please refer to section 5.1 for important information on the population for which efficacy has been established). 4.2 Posology and method of administration The treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the management of multiple sclerosis. Posology The recommended dose of AUBAGIO is 14 mg once daily. Special populations Elderly population AUBAGIO should be used with caution in patients aged 65 years and over due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy. Renal impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild, moderate or severe renal impairment not undergoing dialysis. Patients with severe renal impairment undergoing dialysis were not evaluated. Teriflunomide is contraindicated in this population (see section 4.3). Hepatic impairment No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment. Teriflunomide is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of AUBAGIO in children aged from 10 to less than 18 years has not yet been established. There is no relevant use of teriflunomide in children aged from birth to less than 10 years for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. No data are available. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 120/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Method of administration The film-coated tablets are for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole with some water. AUBAGIO can be taken with or without food. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh class C). Pregnant women, or women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception during treatment with teriflunomide and thereafter as long as its plasma levels are above 0.02 mg/l (see section 4.6). Pregnancy must be excluded before start of treatment (see section 4.6). Breast -feeding women (see section 4.6). Patients with severe immunodeficiency states, e.g. AIDS. Patients with significantly impaired bone marrow function or significant anaemia, leucopenia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. Patients with severe active infection until resolution (see section 4.4). Patients with severe renal impairment undergoing dialysis, because insufficient clinical experience is available in this patient group. Patients with severe hypoproteinaemia, e.g. in nephrotic syndrome. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Monitoring Before treatment Before starting treatment with teriflunomide the following should be assessed: Blood pressure Alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) Complete blood cell count including differential white blood cell and platelet count. During treatment During treatment with teriflunomide the following should be monitored: Blood pressure Alanine aminotransferase (ALT/SGPT) Complete blood cell counts should be performed based on signs and symptoms (e.g. infections) during treatment. Accelerated elimination procedure Teriflunomide is eliminated slowly from the plasma. Without an accelerated elimination procedure, it takes an average of 8 months to reach plasma concentrations less than 0.02 mg/l, although due to individual variation in substance clearance it may take up to 2 years. An accelerated elimination procedure can be used at any time after discontinuation of teriflunomide (see section 4.6 and 5.2 for procedural details). Hepatic effects Elevations of liver enzymes have been observed in patients receiving teriflunomide (see section 4.8). These elevations occurred mostly within the first 6 months of treatment. Liver enzymes should be assessed before initiation of teriflunomide therapy - every two weeks during the first 6 months of treatment, and every 8 weeks thereafter or as indicated by clinical signs and symptoms such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine. For ALT (SGPT) elevations between 2- and 3-fold the upper limit of normal, monitoring must be performed weekly. Teriflunomide therapy should be discontinued if liver injury is suspected; consider discontinuing teriflunomide therapy if elevated liver enzymes (greater than 3-fold ULN) are confirmed. Patients with pre- existing liver disease may be at increased risk of developing elevated liver enzymes when taking teriflunomide and should be closely monitored for signals of liver disease. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 121/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 The medicinal product should be used with caution in patients who consume substantial quantities of alcohol. Since teriflunomide is highly protein bound and as the binding is dependent upon the concentrations of albumin, unbound plasma teriflunomide concentrations are expected to be increased in patients with hypoproteinaemia, e.g. in nephrotic syndrome. Teriflunomide should not be used in patients with conditions of severe hypoproteinaemia. Blood pressure Elevation of blood pressure may occur during treatment with teriflunomide (see section 4.8). Blood pressure must be checked before the start of teriflunomide treatment and periodically thereafter. Blood pressure elevation should be appropriately managed before and during treatment with teriflunomide. Infections Initiation of treatment with teriflunomide should be delayed in patients with severe active infection until resolution. In placebo -controlled studies, no increase in serious infections was observed with teriflunomide (see section 4.8). However, based on the immunomodulatory effect of AUBAGIO, if a patient develops a serious infection, suspending treatment with AUBAGIO should be considered and the benefits and risks should be reassessed prior to re-initiation of therapy. Due to the prolonged half-life, accelerated elimination with cholestyramine or charcoal may be considered. Patients receiving AUBAGIO should be instructed to report symptoms of infections to a physician. Patients with active acute or chronic infections should not start treatment with AUBAGIO until the infection(s) is resolved. The safety of AUBAGIO in individuals with latent tuberculosis infection is unknown, as tuberculosis screening was not systematically performed in clinical studies. For patients testing positive in tuberculosis screening, treat by standard medical practice prior to therapy with AUBAGIO. Respiratory reactions No cases of interstitial lung diseases (ILD) have been reported with teriflunomide in the clinical trials. However, ILD, which is a potentially fatal disorder, has been reported during treatment with leflunomide, the parent compound. ILD may occur acutely during therapy; the risk is increased in patients who had a history of ILD when treated with leflunomide. Pulmonary symptoms, such as persistent cough and dyspnoea, may be a reason for discontinuation of the therapy and for further investigation, as appropriate. Haematological effects A mean decrease less than 15% from baseline affecting white blood cell count has been observed (see section 4.8). As a precaution, a recent complete blood cell count, including differential white blood cell count and platelets, should be available before the initiation of treatment with AUBAGIO and the complete blood cell count should be assessed during AUBAGIO therapy as indicated by clinical signs and symptoms (e.g., infections). In patients with pre-existing anaemia, leucopenia, and /or thrombocytopenia as well as in patients with impaired bone marrow function or those at risk of bone marrow suppression, the risk of haematological disorders is increased. If such effects occur, the accelerated elimination procedure (see above) to reduce plasma levels of teriflunomide should be considered. In cases of severe haematological reactions, including pancytopenia, AUBAGIO and any concomitant myelosuppressive treatment must be discontinued and a teriflunomide accelerated elimination procedure should be considered. Skin reactions Cases of severe skin reactions have been reported postmarketing (including Stevens -Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis). In patients treated with leflunomide, the parent compound, very rare cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have also been reported. In case of ulcerative stomatitis, teriflunomide administration should be discontinued. If skin and /or mucosal reactions are observed which raise the suspicion of severe generalised major skin reactions (Stevens -Johnson syndrome, or toxic epidermal -Lyell's syndrome), Roche Ltd 122/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 other possibly associated treatment must be discontinued, and an accelerated procedure initiated immediately. In such cases patients should not be re-exposed to teriflunomide (see section 4.3). Peripheral neuropathy Cases of peripheral neuropathy have been reported in patients receiving AUBAGIO (see section 4.8). Most patients improved after discontinuation of AUBAGIO. However, there was a wide variability in final outcome, i.e. in some patients the neuropathy resolved and some patients had persistent symptoms. If a patient taking AUBAGIO develops a confirmed peripheral neuropathy, consider discontinuing AUBAGIO therapy and performing the accelerated elimination procedure. Vaccination Two clinical studies have shown that vaccinations to inactivated neoantigen (first vaccination), or recall antigen (reexposure) were safe and effective during AUBAGIO treatment. The use of live attenuated vaccines may carry a risk of infections and should therefore be avoided. Immunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies As leflunomide is the parent compound of teriflunomide, co-administration of teriflunomide with leflunomide is not recommended. Co-administration with antineoplastic or immunosuppressive therapies used for treatment of MS has not been evaluated. Safety studies, in which teriflunomide was concomitantly administered with interferon beta or with glatiramer acetate for up to one year did not reveal any specific safety concerns, but a higher adverse reaction rate as compared to teriflunomide monotherapy was observed. The long term safety of these combinations in the treatment of multiple sclerosis has not been established. Switching to or from AUBAGIO Based on the clinical data related to concomitant administration of teriflunomide with interferon beta or with glatiramer acetate, no waiting period is required when initiating teriflunomide after interferon beta or glatiramer acetate or when starting interferon beta or glatiramer acetate, after teriflunomide. Due to the long half-life of natalizumab, concomitant exposure, and thus concomitant immune effects, could occur for up to 2-3 months following discontinuation of natalizumab if AUBAGIO was immediately started. Therefore, caution is required when switching patients from natalizumab to AUBAGIO. Based on the half-life of fingolimod, a 6-week interval without therapy is needed for clearance from the circulation and a 1 to 2 month period is needed for lymphocytes to return to normal range following discontinuation of fingolimod. Starting AUBAGIO during this interval will result in concomitant exposure to fingolimod. This may lead to an additive effect on the immune system and caution is, therefore, indicated. In MS patients, the median t1/2z was approximately 19 days after repeated doses of 14 mg. If a decision is made to stop treatment with AUBAGIO, during the interval of 5 half-lives (approximately 3.5 months although may be longer in some patients), starting other therapies will result in concomitant exposure to AUBAGIO. This may lead to an additive effect on the immune system and caution is, therefore, indicated. Lactose Since AUBAGIO tablets contain lactose, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose -galactose malabsorption, should not take this medicinal product. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Pharmacokinetic interactions of other substances on teriflunomide The primary biotransformation pathway for teriflunomide is hydrolysis, with oxidation being a pathway. Potent cytochrome P450 (CYP) and transporter inducers: Co-administration of repeated doses (600 mg once daily for 22 days) of rifampicin (a CYP2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein [P-gp] and breast cancer resistant protein [BCRP] with teriflunomide (70 mg single dose) resulted in an approximately 40% decrease in teriflunomide exposure. Rifampicin and other known potent CYP and transporter inducers such carbamazepine, Ocrelizumab phenobarbital, phenytoin and St John's Wort should be used with caution during the treatment with teriflunomide. Cholestyramine or activated charcoal It is recommended that patients receiving teriflunomide are not treated with cholestyramine or activated charcoal because this leads to a rapid and significant decrease in plasma concentration unless an accelerated elimination is desired. The mechanism is thought to be by interruption of enterohepatic recycling and/or gastrointestinal dialysis of teriflunomide. Pharmacokinetic interactions of teriflunomide on other substances Effect of teriflunomide on CYP2C8 substrate: repaglinide There was an repaglinide Cmax and AUC (1.7- and 2.4-fold, respectively), following repeated doses of teriflunomide, suggesting that teriflunomide is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vivo. Therefore, such as repaglinide, paclitaxel, pioglitazone or rosiglitazone, should be used with caution during treatment with teriflunomide. Effect of teriflunomide on oral contraceptive: 0.03 mg ethinylestradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel There was an increase in mean ethinylestradiol Cmax and AUC 0-24 (1.58 AUC 0-24 (1.33 - and 1.41-fold, respectively) following repeated doses of teriflunomide. While this interaction of teriflunomide is not expected to adversely impact the efficacy of oral contraceptives, it should be considered when selecting or adjusting oral contraceptive treatment used in combination with teriflunomide. Effect of teriflunomide on CYP1A2 substrate: caffeine Repeated doses of teriflunomide decreased mean Cmax and AUC of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) by 18% and 55%, respectively, suggesting that teriflunomide may be a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in vivo. Therefore, medicinal products (such as duloxetin, alosetron, theophylline and tizanidine) should be used with caution during treatment with teriflunomide, as it could lead to the reduction of the efficacy of these products. Effect of teriflunomide on warfarin Repeated doses of teriflunomide had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin, indicating that teriflunomide is not an inhibitor or an inducer of CYP2C9. However, a 25% decrease in peak international normalised ratio (INR) was observed when teriflunomide was coadministered with warfarin as compared with warfarin alone. Therefore, when warfarin is co-administered with teriflunomide, close INR follow -up and monitoring is recommended. Effect of teriflunomide on organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) substrates : There was an increase in mean cefaclor Cmax and AUC (1.43 - and 1.54-fold, respectively), following repeated doses of teriflunomide, suggesting that teriflunomide is an inhibitor of OAT3 in Therefore, when on BCRP and /or organic anion transporting polypeptide B1 and B3 (OATP1B1/B3) substrates: There was an increase in mean rosuvastatin Cmax and AUC (2.65 - and 2.51-fold, respectively), following repeated doses of teriflunomide. However, there was no apparent impact of this increase in plasma rosuvastatin exposure on the HMG -CoA reductase activity. For rosuvastatin, a dose reduction by 50% is recommended for coadministration with teriflunomide. For administration of teriflunomide should also be undertaken with caution. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of excessive exposure to the medicinal products and reduction of the dose of these medicinal products should be considered. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Use in males The risk of male -mediated embryo -foetal toxicity through teriflunomide treatment is considered low (see section 5.3). Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 124/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Pregnancy There are limited amount of data from the use of teriflunomide in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Teriflunomide may cause serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Teriflunomide is contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). Women of childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during treatment and after treatment as long as teriflunomide plasma concentration is above 0.02 mg/l. During this period women should discuss any plans to stop or change contraception with the treating physician. The patient must be advised that if there is any delay in onset of menses or any other reason to suspect pregnancy, they must notify the physician immediately for pregnancy testing, and if positive, the physician and patient must discuss the risk to the pregnancy. It is possible that rapidly lowering the blood level of teriflunomide, by instituting the accelerated elimination procedure described below, at the first delay of menses, may decrease the risk to the foetus. For women receiving teriflunomide treatment, who wish to become pregnant, the medicine should be stopped and an accelerated elimination procedure is recommended in order to more rapidly achieve concentration below 0.02 mg/l (see below): If an accelerated elimination procedure is not used, teriflunomide plasma levels can be expected to be above 0.02 mg/l for an average of 8 months, however, in some patients it may take up to 2 years to reach plasma concentration below 0.02 mg/l. Therefore, teriflunomide plasma concentrations should be measured before a woman begins to attempt to become pregnant. Once the teriflunomide plasma concentration is determined to be below 0.02 mg/l, the plasma concentration must be determined again after an interval of at least 14 days. If both plasma concentrations are below 0.02 mg/l, no risk to the foetus is to be expected. For further information on the sample testing please contact the Marketing Authorisation Holder or its local representative (see section 7). Accelerated elimination procedure After stopping treatment with teriflunomide: cholestyramine 8 g is administered 3 times daily for a period of 11 days, or cholestyramine 4 g three times a day can be used, if cholestyramine 8 g three times a day is not well tolerated, alternatively, 50 g of activated powdered charcoal is administered every 12 hours for a period of 11 days. However, also following either of the accelerated elimination procedures, verification by 2 separate tests at an interval of at least 14 days and a waiting period of one-and-a-half months between the first occurrence of a plasma concentration below 0.02 mg/l and fertilisation is required. Both cholestyramine and activated powdered charcoal may influence the absorption of oestrogens and progestogens such that reliable contraception with oral contraceptives may not be guaranteed during the accelerated elimination procedure with cholestyramine or activated powdered charcoal. Use of alternative contraceptive methods is recommended. Breast -feeding Animal studies have shown excretion of teriflunomide in breast milk. Breast -feeding women must, therefore, not receive teriflunomide. Fertility Results of studies in animals have not shown an effect on fertility (see section 5.3). Although human data are lacking, no effect on male and female fertility is anticipated. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines AUBAGIO has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In the case of adverse reactions such as dizziness, which has been reported with leflunomide, the parent compound, the patient's ability to concentrate and to react properly may be impaired. In such cases, patients should refrain from driving cars and using machines. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 127/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 complete hair loss reported) and occurred most often during the first 6 months and with resolution in 121 of 139 (87.1%) patients treated with teriflunomide 14 mg. Discontinuation because of alopecia was 1.3% in the teriflunomide 14 mg teriflunomide group, versus 0.1% in the placebo group. Hepatic effects During placebo -controlled studies the following was detected: ALT increase (based on laboratory data) according to baseline status - Safety population in placebo - controlled studies Placebo Teriflunomide below or equal to 3-fold ULN were more frequently seen in teriflunomide -treated groups as compared to placebo. The frequency of elevations above 3-fold ULN and higher was balanced across treatment groups. These elevations in transaminase occurred mostly within the first 6 months of treatment and were reversible after treatment cessation. The recovery time varied between months and years. Blood pressure effects In placebo -controlled studies the following was established: - systolic blood pressure was >140 mm Hg in 19.9% of patients receiving 14 mg/day teriflunomide as compared to 15.5% receiving placebo; - systolic blood pressure was >160 mm Hg in 3.8% of patients receiving 14 mg/day teriflunomide as compared to 2.0% receiving placebo; diastolic blood pressure was >90 mm Hg in 21.4% of patients receiving 14 mg/day teriflunomide as compared to 13.6% receiving placebo. Infections In placebo -controlled studies, no increase in serious infections was observed with teriflunomide 14 mg (2.7%) as compared to placebo (2.2%). Serious opportunistic infections occurred in 0.2% of each group. Severe infections including sepsis, sometimes fatal have been reported postmarketing. Haematological effects A mean decrease affecting white blood cell (WBC) count (<15% from baseline levels, mainly neutrophil and lymphocytes decrease) was observed in placebo -controlled trials with AUBAGIO, although a greater decrease was observed in some patients. The decrease in mean count from baseline occurred during the first 6 weeks then stabilised over time while on-treatment but at decreased levels (less than a 15% decrease from baseline). The effect on red blood cell (RBC) (<2%) and platelet counts (<10%) was less pronounced. Peripheral neuropathy In placebo -controlled studies, peripheral neuropathy, including both polyneuropathy and mononeuropathy (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome), was reported more frequently in patients taking teriflunomide than in patients taking placebo. In the pivotal, placebo -controlled studies, the incidence of peripheral neuropathy confirmed by nerve conduction studies was 1.9% (17 patients out of 898) on 14 mg of teriflunomide, compared with 0.4% (4 patients out of 898) on placebo. Treatment was discontinued in 5 patients with peripheral neuropathy on teriflunomide 14 mg. Recovery following treatment discontinuation was reported in 4 of these patients. Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps) There does not appear to be an increased risk of malignancy with teriflunomide in the clinical trial experience. The risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoproliferative disorders, is increased with use of some other agents that affect the immune system (class effect). Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 128/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Severe skin reactions Cases of severe skin reactions have been reported with teriflunomide post-marketing (see section 4.4). Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose Symptoms There is no experience regarding teriflunomide overdose or intoxication in humans. Teriflunomide 70 mg daily was administered up to 14 days in healthy subjects. The adverse reactions were consistent with the safety profile for teriflunomide in MS patients. Management In the event of relevant overdose or toxicity, cholestyramine or activated charcoal is recommended to accelerate elimination. The recommended elimination procedure is cholestyramine 8 g three times a day for 11 days. If this is not well tolerated, cholestyramine 4 g three times a day for 11 days can be used. Alternatively, when cholestyramine is not available, activated charcoal 50 g twice a day for 11 days may also be used. In addition, if required for tolerability reasons, administration of cholestyramine or activated charcoal does not need to occur on consecutive days (see section 5.2). 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressants, is an immunomodulatory agent with anti-inflammatory properties enzyme dehydrogenase (DHO -DH), required the de novo pyrimidine synthesis. As a consequence teriflunomide reduces the proliferation of dividing cells that need de novo synthesis of pyrimidine to expand. The exact mechanism by which teriflunomide exerts its therapeutic effect in MS is not fully understood, but this is mediated by a reduced number of lymphocytes. Pharmacodynamic effects Immune system Effects on immune cell numbers in the blood: In the placebo -controlled studies, teriflunomide 14 mg once a day led to a mild mean reduction in lymphocyte count, of less than 0.3 x 109/l, which occurred over the first 3 months of treatment and levels were maintained until the end of the treatment. Potential to prolong the QT interval In a placebo -controlled thorough QT study performed in healthy subjects, teriflunomide at mean steady - state concentrations did not show any potential for prolonging the QTcF interval compared with placebo: the largest time matched mean difference between teriflunomide and placebo was 3.45 ms with the upper bound of the 90% CI being 6.45 ms. Effect on renal tubular functions In the placebo -controlled studies, mean decreases in serum uric acid at a range of 20 to 30% were observed in patients treated with teriflunomide compared to placebo. Mean decrease in serum phosphorus was around 10% in the teriflunomide group compared to placebo. These effects are considered to be related to increase in renal tubular excretion and not related to changes in glomerular functions. Clinical efficacy and safety Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 129/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 The efficacy of AUBAGIO was demonstrated in two placebo -controlled studies, the TEMSO and the TOWER study, that evaluated once daily doses of teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg in patients with RMS. A total of 1088 patients with RMS were randomised in TEMSO to receive 7 mg (n=366) or 14 mg (n=359) of teriflunomide or placebo (n= 363) for 108 weeks duration. All patients had a definite diagnosis of MS (based on McDonald criteria (2001)), exhibited a relapsing clinical course, with or without progression, and experienced at least 1 relapse over the year preceding the trial or at least 2 relapses over the 2 years preceding the trial. At entry, patients had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 5.5. The mean age of the study population was 37.9 years. The majority of patients had relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis (91.5%), but a subgroup of patients had secondary progressive (4.7%) or progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis (3.9%). The mean number of relapses within the year before study inclusion was 1.4 with 36.2% of patients having gadolinium -enhancing lesions at baseline. The median EDSS score at baseline was 2.50; 249 patients (22.9%) had an EDSS score 3.5 at baseline. The mean duration of disease, since first symptoms, was 8.7 years. A majority of patients (73%) had not received disease - modifying therapy during the 2 years before study entry. The study results are shown in Table 1. A total of 1169 patients with RMS were randomised in TOWER to receive 7 mg (n=408) or 14 mg (n=372) of teriflunomide or placebo (n= 389) for a variable treatment duration ending at 48 weeks after last patient randomised. All patients had a definite diagnosis of MS (based on McDonald criteria (2005)), exhibited a relapsing clinical course, with or without progression, and experienced at least 1 relapse over the year preceding the trial or at least 2 relapses over the 2 years preceding the trial. At entry, patients had an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 5.5. The mean age of the study population was 37.9 years. The majority of patients had relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis (97.5%), but a subgroup of patients had secondary progressive (0.8%) or progressive relapsing multiple sclerosis (1.7%). The mean number of relapses within the year before study inclusion was 1.4. Gadolinium -enhancing lesions at baseline: no data. The median EDSS score at baseline was 2.50; 298 patients (25.5%) had an EDSS score 3.5 at baseline. The mean duration of disease, since first symptoms, was 8.0 years. A majority of patients (67.2%) had not received disease -modifying therapy during the 2 years before study entry. The study results are shown in Table 1. Table 1 - Main Results (for the approved dose, ITT population) N Clinical Outcomes Annualised relapse rate Risk difference (CI95%) Relapse -free week 108 Hazard ratio (CI95%) 3-month Sustained Disability Progression week 108 Hazard ratio (CI95%) 6-month Sustained Disability Progression week 108 Hazard ratio (CI95%) MRI endpoints Change in BOD week 10 (1) 8 Change relative to placebo Mean Number of Gd- enhancing lesions at week 108 TEMSO -study Teriflunomide Placebo 1.18 TOWER -study Teriflunomide Roche Ltd 130/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Change relative to placebo (CI95%) Number of unique active lesions /scan Change relative total lesion volume (T2 and T1 hypointense) in ml Efficacy in patients with high disease activity: A consistent treatment effect on relapses and time to 3-month sustained disability progression in a subgroup of patients in TEMSO (n= 127) with high disease activity was observed. Due to the design of the study, high disease activity was defined as 2 or more relapses in one year, and with one or more Gd- enhancing lesion on brain MRI. No similar subgroup analysis was performed in TOWER as no MRI data were obtained. No data are available in patients who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course (normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon, having had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gd-enhancing lesion, or patients having an unchanged or increased relapse rate in the prior year as compared to the previous 2 years. TOPIC was a double -blind, placebo -controlled study that evaluated once daily doses of teriflunomide 7 mg and 14 mg for up to 108 weeks in patients with first clinical demyelinating event (mean age 32.1 years). The primary endpoint was time to a second clinical episode (relapse). A total of 618 patients were randomized to receive 7 mg (n=205) or 14 mg (n=216) of teriflunomide or placebo (n=197). The risk of a second clinical attack over 2 years was 35.9% in the placebo group and 24.0% in the teriflunomide 14 mg treatment group 95% confidence interval: 0.38 to 0.87, p=0.0087). The results from the TOPIC study confirmed the efficacy of teriflunomide in RRMS (including early RRMS with first clinical demyelinating event and MRI lesions disseminated in time and space). Teriflunomide effectiveness was compared to that of a subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (at the recommended dose of 44 \u00b5g three times a week) in 324 randomised patients in a study (TENERE) with minimum treatment duration of 48 weeks (maximum 114 weeks). The risk of failure (confirmed relapse or permanent treatment discontinuation whichever came first) was the primary endpoint. The number of patients with permanent treatment discontinuation in the teriflunomide 14 mg group was 22 out of 111 (19.8%), the reasons being adverse events (10.8%), lack of efficacy (3.6%), other reason (4.5%) and lost to follow -up (0.9%). The number of patients with permanent treatment discontinuation in the subcutaneous interferon beta-1a group was 30 out of 104 (28 .8%), the reasons being adverse events (21.2%), lack of efficacy (1.9%), other reason (4.8%) and poor compliance to protocol (1%). Teriflunomide 14 mg/day was not superior to interferon beta- 1a on the primary endpoint: the estimated percentage of patients with treatment failure at 96 weeks using the Kaplan -Meier method was 41.1% versus 44.4% (teriflunomide 14 mg versus interferon beta-1a group, p=0.595). Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with AUBAGIO in children from birth to less than 10 years in treatment of multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with AUBAGIO in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Absorption Median time to reach maximum plasma concentrations occurs between 1 to 4 hours post-dose following repeated oral administration of teriflunomide, with high bioavailability (approximately 100%). Food does not have a clinically relevant effect on teriflunomide pharmacokinetics. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 131/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 From the mean predicted pharmacokinetic parameters calculated from the population pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis using data from healthy volunteers and MS patients, there is a slow approach to steady - state concentration (i.e., approximately 100 days (3.5 months) to attain 95% of steady -state concentrations) and the estimated AUC accumulation ratio is approximately 34-fold. Distribution Teriflunomide is extensively bound to plasma protein (>99%), probably albumin and is mainly distributed in plasma. The volume of distribution is 11 l after a single intravenous (IV) administration. However, this is most likely an underestimation since extensive organ distribution was observed in rats. Biotransformation Teriflunomide is moderately metabolised and is the only component detected in plasma. The primary biotransformation pathway for teriflunomide is hydrolysis with oxidation being a minor pathway. Secondary pathways involve oxidation, N-acetylation and sulfate conjugation. Elimination Teriflunomide is excreted in the gastrointestinal tract mainly through the bile as unchanged medicinal product and most likely by direct secretion. Teriflunomide is a substrate of the efflux transporter BCRP, which could be involved in direct secretion. Over 21 days, 60.1% of the administered dose is excreted via feces (37.5%) and urine (22.6%). After the rapid elimination procedure with cholestyramine, an additional 23.1% was recovered (mostly in feces). Based on individual prediction of pharmacokinetic parameters using the PopPK model of teriflunomide in healthy volunteers and MS patients, median t1/2z was approximately 19 days after repeated doses of 14 mg. After a single IV administration, the total body clearance of teriflunomide is 30.5 ml/h. Accelerated Elimination Procedure: Cholestyramine and activated charcoal The elimination of teriflunomide from the circulation can be accelerated by administration of cholestyramine or activated charcoal, presumably by interrupting the reabsorption processes at the intestinal level. Teriflunomide concentrations measured during an 11-day procedure to accelerate teriflunomide elimination with either 8 g cholestyramine three times a day, 4 g cholestyramine three times a day or 50 g activated charcoal twice a day following cessation of teriflunomide treatment have shown that these regimens were effective in accelerating teriflunomide elimination, leading to more than 98% decrease in teriflunomide plasma concentrations, with cholestyramine being faster than charcoal. Following discontinuation of teriflunomide and the administration of cholestyramine 8 g three times a day, the plasma concentration of teriflunomide is reduced 52% at the end of day 1, 91% at the end of day 3, 99.2% at the end of day 7, and 99.9% at the completion of day 11. The choice between the 3 elimination procedures should depend on the patient's tolerability. If cholestyramine 8 g three times a day is not well-tolerated, cholestyramine 4 g three times a day can be used. Alternatively, activated charcoal may also be used (the 11 days do not need to be consecutive unless there is a need to lower teriflunomide plasma concentration rapidly). Linearity/non -linearity Systemic exposure increases in a dose proportional manner after oral administration teriflunomide from 7 to 14 mg. Characteristics in specific groups of patients Gender, Elderly, Paediatric patients Several sources of intrinsic variability were identified in healthy subjects and MS patients based on the PopPK analysis: age, body weight, gender, race, and albumin and bilirubin levels. Nevertheless, their impact remains limited (31%). Hepatic impairment Mild and moderate hepatic impairment had no impact on the pharmacokinetic of teriflunomide. Therefore no dose adjustment is anticipated in mild and moderate hepatic -impaired patients. However, teriflunomide is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.3). Renal impairment Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 132/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Severe renal impairment had no impact on the pharmacokinetic of teriflunomide. Therefore no dose adjustment is anticipated in mild, moderate and severe renal -impaired patients. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Repeated oral administration of teriflunomide to mice, rats and dogs for up to 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively, revealed that the major targets of toxicity were the bone marrow, lymphoid organs, oral cavity/ gastro intestinal tract, reproductive organs, and pancreas. Evidence of an oxidative effect on red blood cells was also observed. Anemia, decreased platelet counts and effects on the immune system, including leukopenia, lymphopenia and secondary infections, were related to the effects on the bone marrow and/or lymphoid organs. The majority of effects reflect the basic mode of action of the compound (inhibition of dividing cells). Animals are more sensitive to the pharmacology, and therefore toxicity, of teriflunomide than humans. As a result, toxicity in animals was found at exposures equivalent or below human therapeutic levels. Teriflunomide was not mutagenic in vitro or clastogenic in vivo. Clastogenicity observed in vitro was considered to be an indirect effect related to nucleotide pool imbalance resulting from the pharmacology of clastogenicity in vitro but not in vivo. No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in rats and mice. Fertility was unaffected in rats despite adverse effects of teriflunomide on male reproductive organs, including reduced sperm count. There were no external malformations in the offspring of male rats administered teriflunomide prior to mating with untreated female rats. Teriflunomide was embryotoxic and teratogenic in rats and rabbits at doses in the human therapeutic range. Adverse effects on the offspring were also seen when teriflunomide was administered to pregnant rats during gestation and lactation. The risk of male -mediated embryo -fetal toxicity through teriflunomide treatment is considered low. The estimated female plasma exposure via the semen of a treated patient is expected to be 100 times lower than the plasma exposure after 14 mg of oral teriflunomide. 6.

MARKETING AUTHORISATION HOLDER sanofi -aventis groupe 54, rue La OF THE AUTHORISATION Date of first authorisation: 26 August 2013 10. DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT Detailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu.. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La 20mg/ml, Solution Injection, Pre-Filled Syringe Summary of Product Characteristics Updated 21-Apr-2016 | Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd 1. Name of the medicinal product Copaxone \u00ae 20 mg/ml Solution for Injection, Pre-filled Syringe 2. Qualitative and quantitative composition 1 ml of solution for injection contains 20 mg glatiramer acetate *, equivalent to 18 mg of glatiramer base per pre-filled syringe * The average molecular weight of glatiramer acetate mixture is in the range of 5,000 -9,000 daltons. Due to its compositional complexity, no specified polypeptide can be fully characterized in terms of amino acid sequence , although the final glatiramer acetate composition is not entirely random. For full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. Pharmaceutical form Solution for Injection, Pre-filled Syringe Clear solution free of visible particles The solution for injection has a pH of 5.5 - 7.0 and an osmolarity of about 265 mOsmol/L. 4. Clinical particulars 4.1 Therapeutic indications Copaxone is indicated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) (see section 5.1 for important information on the population for which efficacy has been established). Copaxone is not indicated in primary or secondary progressive MS. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Posology The recommended dosage in adults is 20 mg of glatiramer acetate (one pre-filled syringe), administered as a subcutaneous injection once daily. At the present time, it is not known for how long the patient should be treated. A decision concerning long term treatment should be made on an individual basis by the treating physician. Paediatric population Children and adolescents: No prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. However, limited published data suggest that the safety profile in adolescents from 12 to 18 years of age receiving Copaxone 20 mg subcutaneously every day is similar to that seen in adults. There is not enough information available on the use of Copaxone in children below 12 years of age to make any recommendation for its use. Therefore, Copaxone should not be used in this population. Elderly patients Copaxone has not been specifically studied in the elderly. Patients with renal impairment Copaxone has not been specifically studied in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4). Method of administration Patients should be instructed in self-injection techniques and should be supervised by a health -care professional the first time they self-inject and for 30 minutes after. A different site for injection should be chosen every day, so this will reduce the chances of any irritation or pain at the site of the injection. Sites for self-injection include the abdomen, arms, hips and thighs. 4.3 Contraindications Copaxone is contraindicated under the following conditions: Hypersensitivity to glatiramer acetate or mannitol. Pregnant women 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 135/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Copaxone should only be administered subcutaneously. Copaxone should not be administered by intravenous or intramuscular routes. The initiation of Copaxone treatment should be supervised by a neurologist or a physician experienced in the treatment of MS. The treating physician should explain to the patient that a reaction associated with at least one of the following symptoms may occur within minutes of a Copaxone injection: vasodilatation (flushing), chest pain, dyspnoea, palpitations or tachycardia. The majority of these symptoms is short -lived and resolves spontaneously without any sequelae. Should a severe adverse event occur, the patient must immediately stop Copaxone treatment and contact his/her physician or any emergency doctor. Symptomatic treatment may be instituted at the discretion of the physician. There is no evidence to suggest that any particular patient groups are at special risk from these reactions. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when administering Copaxone to patients with pre-existing cardiac disorders. These patients should be followed up regularly during treatment. Convulsions and/or anaphylactoid or allergic reactions have been reported rarely. Serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. bronchospasm, anaphylaxis or urticaria) may rarely occur. If reactions are severe, appropriate treatment should be instituted and Copaxone should be discontinued. Glatiramer acetate -reactive antibodies were detected in patients' sera during daily chronic treatment with Copaxone. Maximal levels were attained after average treatment duration of 3-4 months and, thereafter, declined and stabilised at a level slightly higher than baseline. There is no evidence to suggest that these glatiramer acetate -reactive antibodies are neutralising or that their formation is likely to affect the clinical efficacy of Copaxone. In patients with renal impairment, renal function should be monitored while they are treated with Copaxone. Whilst there is no evidence of glomerular deposition of immune complexes in patients, the possibility cannot be excluded. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Interaction between Copaxone and other medicinal products have not been formally evaluated. Observations from existing clinical trials and post-marketing experience do not suggest any significant interactions of Copaxone with therapies commonly used in MS patients, including the concurrent use of corticosteroids for up to 28 days. In vitro work suggests that glatiramer acetate in blood is highly bound to plasma proteins but that it is not displaced by, and does not itself displace, phenytoin or carbamazepine. Nevertheless, as Copaxone has, theoretically, the potential to affect the distribution of protein bound substances, concomitant use of such medicinal products should be monitored carefully. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are no adequate data from the use of glatiramer acetate in pregnant women. Animal studies are insufficient with respect to effects on pregnancy, embryonal/foetal development, parturition and postnatal development (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. Copaxone is contraindicated during pregnancy. A contraceptive cover should be considered whilst using this medicinal product. Breastfeeding Data regarding excretion of glatiramer acetate, its metabolites or antibodies in human milk are unavailable. Caution should be exercised when Copaxone is administered to a nursing mother. The relative risk and benefit to the mother and child should be taken into consideration. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 4.8 Undesirable effects In all clinical trials, injection -site reactions were seen to be the most frequent adverse reactions and were reported by the majority of patients receiving Copaxone. In controlled studies, the proportion of patients reporting these reactions, at least once, was higher following treatment with Copaxone (70%) than placebo injections (37%). The most commonly reported injection -site reactions, in Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 136/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 clinical trials and in post marketing experience, were erythema, pain, mass, pruritus, oedema, inflammation and hypersensitivity, and rare occurrences of lipoatrophy and skin necrosis. A reaction, associated with at least one or more of the following symptoms, has been described as the Immediate Post-Injection Reaction: vasodilatation(flushing), chest pain, dyspnoea, palpitation or tachycardia. This reaction may occur within minutes of a Copaxone injection. At least one component of this Immediate Post- Injection Reaction was reported at least once by 31% of patients receiving Copaxone compared to 13% of patients receiving placebo. All adverse reactions, which were more frequently reported in Copaxone vs. placebo -treated patients, are presented in the table below. This data was derived from four pivotal, double -blind, placebo - controlled clinical trials with a total of 512 patients treated with Copaxone and 509 patients treated with placebo for up to 36 months. Three trials in relapsing -remitting MS (RRMS) included a total of 269 patients treated with Copaxone and 271 patients treated with placebo for up to 35 months. The fourth trial in patients who have experienced a first clinical episode and were determined to be at high risk of developing clinically definite MS included 243 patients treated with Copaxone and 238 patients treated with placebo for up to 36 months.

Includes terms which relate to localized lipoatrophy at the injection sites . In the fourth trial noted above, an open -label treatment phase followed the placebo -controlled period (see section 5.1). No change in the known risk profile of Copaxone was observed during the open -label follow -up period of up to 5 years. The following adverse reaction reports were collected from MS patients treated with Copaxone in uncontrolled clinica l trials and from post-marketing experience with Copaxone: hypersensitivity reactions (including rare occurrence of anaphylaxis, >1/10000, < 1/1000. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme at: www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard. 4.9 Overdose Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Version 5 A few cases of overdose with Copaxone (up to 300 mg glatiramer acetate) have been reported. These cases were not associated with any adverse reactions other than those mentioned in section 4.8. In case of overdose, patients should be monitored and the appropriate symptomatic and supportive therapy instituted. 5. Pharmacological properties 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic mechanism(s) by which glatiramer acetate exerts its effects in patients with MS is (are) not fully elucidated. However, it is thought to act by modifying immune processes that are currently believed to be responsible for the pathogenesis of MS. This hypothesis is supported by findings of studies that have been carried out to explore the pathogenesis of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), a condition induced in several animal species through immunisation against central nervous system derived material containing myelin and often used as an experimental animal model of MS. Studies in animals and in MS patients suggest that upon its administration, glatiramer acetate - specific suppressor T cells are induced and activated in the periphery. RRMS: A total of 269 patients have been treated with Copaxone in three controlled trials. The first was a two-year study involving 50 patients (Copaxone n=25, placebo n=25) who were diagnosed with relapsing -remitting MS by the then- applicable standard criteria, and who had at least two attacks of neurological dysfunction (exacerbations) during the preceding two years. The second study applied the same inclusion criteria and included 251 patients treated for up to 35 months (Copaxone n=125, placebo n=126). The third study was a nine-month study involving 239 patients (Copaxone n=119, placebo n=120) where inclusion criteria were similar to those in the first and second studies with the additional criterion that patients had to have at least one gadolinium - enhancing lesion on the screening MRI. In clinical trials in MS patients receiving Copaxone, a significant reduction in the number of relapses, compared with placebo, was seen. In the largest controlled study, the relapse rate was reduced by 32% from 1.98 under placebo to 1.34 under glatiramer acetate. Exposure data are available for up to twelve years in 103 patients treated with Copaxone. Copaxone has also demonstrated beneficial effects over placebo on MRI parameters relevant to relapsing -remitting MS. Copaxone had, however, no beneficial effect on progression of disability in relapsing -remitting MS patients. There is no evidence that Copaxone treatment has an effect on relapse duration or severity. There is currently no evidence for the use of Copaxone in patients with primary or secondary progressive disease. Single clinical event suggestive of MS: One placebo -controlled study involving 481 patients (Copaxone n=243, placebo n=238) was performed in patients with a well-defined, single, unifocal neurological manifestation and MRI features highly suggestive of MS (at least two cerebral lesions on the T2-weighted MRI above 6 mm diameter). Any disease other than MS that could better explain signs and symptoms of the patient had to be excluded. The placebo -controlled period was followed by an open label treatment: Patients who either presented with MS symptoms or were asymptomatic for three years, whichever came first, were assigned to active drug treatment in an open -label phase for an additional period of two years, not exceeding a maximal total treatment duration of 5 years. Of the 243 patients initially randomized to Copaxone, 198 continued Copaxone treatment in the open - label phase. Of the 238 patients initially randomized to placebo, 211 switched to Copaxone treatment in the open -label phase. During the placebo -controlled period of up to three years, Copaxone delayed the progression from the first clinical event to clinically definite multiple sclerosis (CDMS) according to Poser criteria in a statistically significant and clinically meaningful manner, corresponding to a risk reduction of 45% (Hazard Ratio = 0.55; 95% CI [0.40; 0.77], p-value=0.0005). The proportion of patients who converted to CDMS was 43% for the placebo group and 25% in the Copaxone group. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 139/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 The favourable effect of treatment with Copaxone over placebo was also demonstrated in two secondary MRI endpoints, i.e. number of new T2 lesions and T2 lesion volume. Post-hoc subgroup analyses were performed in patients with various baseline characteristics to identify a population at high risk to develop the second attack. For subjects with baseline MRI with at least one T1 Gd-enhancing lesion and 9 or more T2 lesions, conversion to CDMS was evident for 50% of the placebo subjects vs. 28% of the Copaxone subjects in 2.4 years. For subjects with 9 or more T2 lesions at baseline, conversion to CDMS was evident for 45% of the placebo subjects vs. 26% on Copaxone in 2.4 years. However, the impact of early treatment with Copaxone on the long term evolution of the disease is unknown even in these high-risk subgroups as the study was mainly designed to assess the time to the second event. In any case, treatment should only be considered for patients classified at high risk. The effect shown in the placebo -controlled phase was sustained in the long-term follow -up period of up to 5 years. The time progression from the first clinical event to CDMS was prolonged with earlier Copaxone treatment as compared to delayed treatment, reflecting a 41% risk reduction with earlier versus later treatment (Hazard Ratio = 0.59; 95% CI [0.44; 0.80], p-value=0.0005). The proportion of subjects in the Delayed Start group who progressed was higher (49.6%) compared to those in the Early Start group (32.9%). A consistent effect in favour of early treatment over delayed treatment across time was shown for the annualized number of lesions over the entire study period in new T1 Gd-enhancing lesions (reduced by 54%; p<0.0001), new by 42%; T1 hypointense lesions (reduced by 52%; p<0.0001). An effect in reductions in favour of early versus delayed treatment was also observed for the total number of new T1 Gd- enhancing lesions (reduced by 46%; p=0.001), T1 volume (a mean difference of -0.06 ml; p<0.001), as well as the total number of new T1 hypointense lesions (reduced by 46%; p<0.001) measured over the entire study period. No appreciable differences between the Early Start and Delayed Start cohorts were observed for either hypointense T1 lesion volume or brain atrophy over 5 years. However, analysis of brain atrophy at last observed value (adjusted to treatment exposure) showed a reduction in favour of early treatment with GA (the mean difference of percent change in brain volume was 0.28%; p=0.0209). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Pharmacokinetic studies in patients have not been performed. In vitro data and limited data from healthy volunteers indicate that with subcutaneous administration of glatiramer acetate, the active substance is readily absorbed and that a large part of the dose is rapidly degraded to smaller fragments already in subcutaneous tissue. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Preclinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction, genotoxicity or carcinogenicity, beyond the information included in other sections of the SPC. Due to the lack of pharmacokinetic data in humans, margins of exposure between humans and animals can not be established. Immune complex deposition in the glomeruli of the kidney was reported in a small number of rats and monkeys treated for at least 6 months. In a 2 years rat study, no indication of immune complex deposition in the glomeruli of the kidney was seen. Anaphylaxis after administration to sensitised animals (guinea pigs or mice) was reported. The relevance of these data for humans is unknown. Toxicity at the injection site was a common finding after repeated administration in animals. 6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT GILENYA 0.5 mg hard capsules 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each capsule contains 0.5 mg fingolimod (as hydrochloride). For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Hard capsule Capsule of 16 mm with bright yellow opaque cap and white opaque body; imprint with black ink, \"FTY0.5 mg\" on cap and two radial bands imprinted on the body with yellow ink. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Gilenya is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for the following adult patient groups: - Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least one disease modifying therapy (for exceptions and information about washout periods see sections 4.4 and 5.1). or - Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 4.2 Posology and method of administration The treatment should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in multiple sclerosis. Posology The recommended dose of Gilenya is one 0.5 mg capsule taken orally once daily. Gilenya can be taken with or without food. The same first dose monitoring as for treatment initiation is recommended when treatment is interrupted for: 1 day or more during the first 2 weeks of treatment. more than 7 days during weeks 3 and 4 of treatment. more than 2 weeks after one month of treatment. If the treatment interruption is of shorter duration than the above, the treatment should be continued with the next dose as planned (see section 4.4). Special populations Elderly population Gilenya should be used with caution in patients aged 65 years and over due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2). Renal impairment Gilenya was not studied in patients with renal impairment in the multiple sclerosis pivotal studies. Based on clinical pharmacology studies, no dose adjustments are needed in patients with mild to severe renal impairment. Hepatic impairment Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 142/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Gilenya must not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh class C) (see section 4.3). Although no dose adjustments are needed in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment, caution should be exercised when initiating treatment in these patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Diabetic patients Gilenya has not been studied in multiple sclerosis patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus. Gilenya should be used with caution in these patients due to a potential increase in the risk of macular oedema (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Regular ophthalmological examinations should be conducted in these patients to detect macular oedema. Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Gilenya in children aged 0 to 18 years have not yet been established. Currently available data are described in section 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can be made. 4.3 Contraindications Known immunodeficiency syndrome. Patients with increased risk for opportunistic infections, including immunocompromised patients (including those currently receiving immunosuppressive therapies or those immunocompromised by prior therapies). Severe active infections, active chronic infections (hepatitis, tuberculosis). Known active malignancies. Severe liver impairment (Child -Pugh class C). Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Bradyarrhythmia Initiation of Gilenya treatment results in a transient decrease in heart rate and may also be associated with atrioventricular conduction delays, including the occurrence of isolated reports of transient, spontaneously resolving complete AV block (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). After the first dose, the decline in heart rate starts within one hour, and is maximal within 6 hours. This post-dose effect persists over the following days, although usually to a milder extent, and usually abates over the next weeks. With continued administration, the average heart rate returns towards baseline within one month. However individual patients may not return to baseline heart rate by the end of the first month. Conduction abnormalities were typically transient and asymptomatic. They usually did not require treatment and resolved within the first 24 hours on treatment. If necessary, the decrease in heart rate induced by fingolimod can be reversed by parenteral doses of atropine or isoprenaline. All patients should have an ECG and blood pressure measurement performed prior to and 6 hours after the first dose of Gilenya. All patients should be monitored for a period of 6 hours for signs and symptoms of bradycardia with hourly heart rate and blood pressure measurement. Continuous (real time) ECG monitoring during this 6 hour period is recommended. Should post-dose bradyarrhythmia -related symptoms occur, appropriate clinical management should be initiated and monitoring should be continued until the symptoms have resolved. Should a patient require pharmacological intervention during the first-dose monitoring, overnight monitoring in a medical facility should be instituted and the first-dose monitoring should be repeated after the second dose of Gilenya. If the heart rate at 6 hours is the lowest since the first dose was administered (suggesting that the maximum pharmacodynamic effect on the heart may not yet be manifest), monitoring should be extended by at least 2 hours and until heart rate increases again. Additionally, if after 6 hours, the heart rate is <45 bpm, or the ECG shows new onset second degree or higher grade AV block or a QTc interval 500 msec, extended monitoring (at least overnight monitoring), should be performed, and until the findings have resolved. The occurrence at any time of third degree AV block should also lead to extended monitoring (at least overnight monitoring). Very rare cases of T-wave inversion have been reported in patients treated with fingolimod. In case of T- wave inversion, the prescriber should ensure that there are no associated myocardial ischaemia signs or symptoms. If myocardial ischaemia is suspected, it is recommended to seek advice from a cardiologist. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 143/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Due to the risk of serious rhythm disturbances, Gilenya should not be used in patients with second degree Mobitz type II or higher AV block, sick-sinus syndrome, or sino-atrial heart block, a history of symptomatic bradycardia or recurrent syncope, or in patients with significant QT prolongation (QTc>470msec (female) or >450msec (male)). Since significant bradycardia may be poorly tolerated in patients with known ischaemic heart disease (including angina pectoris), cerebrovascular disease, history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, history of cardiac arrest, uncontrolled hypertension or severe sleep apnoea, Gilenya should not be used in these patients. In such patients, treatment with Gilenya should be considered only if the anticipated benefits outweigh the potential risks. If treatment is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought prior to initiation of treatment in order to determine the most appropriate monitoring, at least overnight extended monitoring is recommended for treatment initiation (see also section 4.5). Gilenya has not been studied in patients with arrhythmias requiring treatment with class Ia (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medicinal products. Class Ia and class III antiarrhythmic medicinal products have been associated with cases of torsades de pointes in patients with bradycardia. Since initiation of Gilenya treatment results in decreased heart rate, Gilenya should not be used concomitantly with these medicinal products. Experience with Gilenya is limited in patients receiving concurrent therapy with beta blockers, heart - rate- lowering calcium channel blockers (such as verapamil, diltiazem or ivabradine), or other substances which may decrease heart rate (e.g. digoxin, anticholinesteratic agents or pilocarpine). Since the initiation of Gilenya treatment is also associated with slowing of the heart rate (see also section 4.8, Bradyarrhythmia), concomitant use of these substances during Gilenya initiation may be associated with severe bradycardia and heart block. Because of the potential additive effect on heart rate treatment with Gilenya should not be initiated in patients who are concurrently treated with these substances (see also section 4.5). In such patients, treatment with Gilenya should be considered only if the anticipated benefits outweigh the potential risks. If treatment with Gilenya is considered, advice from a cardiologist should be sought regarding the switch to non heart -rate lowering medicinal products prior to initiation of treatment. If the heart -rate-lowering medication cannot be stopped, cardiologist's advice should be sought to determine appropriate first dose monitoring, at least overnight extended monitoring is recommended (see also section 4.5). The effects on heart rate and atrioventricular conduction may recur on re -introduction of Gilenya treatment depending on duration of the interruption and time since start of Gilenya treatment. The same first dose monitoring as for treatment initiation is recommended when treatment is interrupted for: 1 day or more during the first 2 weeks of treatment. more than 7 days during weeks 3 and 4 of treatment. more than 2 weeks after one month of treatment. If the treatment interruption is of shorter duration than the above, the treatment should be continued with the next dose as planned. QT interval In a thorough QT interval study of doses of 1.25 or 2.5 mg fingolimod at steady -state, when a negative chronotropic effect of fingolimod was still present, fingolimod treatment resulted in a prolongation of QTcI, with the upper limit of the 90% CI 13.0 ms. There is no dose - or exposure -response relationship of fingolimod and QTcI prolongation. There is no consistent signal of increased incidence of QTcI outliers, either absolute or change from baseline, associated with fingolimod treatment. The clinical relevance of this finding is unknown. In the multiple sclerosis studies, clinically relevant effects on prolongation of the QTc-interval have not been observed but patients at risk for QT prolongation were not included in clinical studies. Medicinal products that may prolong QTc interval are best avoided in patients with relevant risk factors, for example, hypokalaemia or congenital QT prolongation. Infections A core pharmacodynamic effect of Gilenya is a dose -dependent reduction of the peripheral lymphocyte count to 20-30% of baseline values. This is due to the reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues (see section 5.1). Before initiating treatment with Gilenya, a recent complete blood count (CBC) (i.e. within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior therapy) should be available. Assessments of CBC are also recommended Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 144/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 periodically during treatment, at month 3 and at least yearly thereafter, and in case of signs of infection. Absolute lymphocyte count <0.2x109/l, if confirmed, should lead to treatment interruption until recovery, because in clinical studies, fingolimod treatment was interrupted in patients with absolute lymphocyte count <0.2x109/l. Initiation of treatment with Gilenya should be delayed in patients with severe active infection until resolution. Patients need to be assessed for their immunity to varicella (chickenpox) prior to Gilenya treatment. It is recommended that patients without a health care professional confirmed history of chickenpox or documentation of a full course of vaccination with varicella vaccine undergo antibody testing to varicella zoster virus (VZV) before initiating Gilenya therapy. A full course of vaccination for antibody -negative patients with varicella vaccine is recommended prior to commencing treatment with Gilenya (see section 4.8). Initiation of treatment with Gilenya should be postponed for 1 month to allow full effect of vaccination to occur. The immune system effects of Gilenya may increase the risk of infections, including opportunistic infections (see section 4.8). Effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies should be employed in patients with symptoms of infection while on therapy. During treatment, patients receiving Gilenya should be instructed to report symptoms of infection to their physician. Suspension of Gilenya should be considered if a patient develops a serious infection and consideration of benefit -risk should be undertaken prior to re-initiation of therapy. Isolated cases of cryptococcal meningitis (a fungal infection) have been reported in the post - marketing setting (see section 4.8). Patients with symptoms and signs consistent with cryptococcal meningitis (e.g. headache accompanied by mental changes such as confusion, hallucinations, and/or personality changes) should undergo prompt diagnostic evaluation. If cryptococcal meningitis is diagnosed, fingolimod should be suspended and appropriate treatment should be initiated. A multidisciplinary consultation (i.e. infectious disease specialist) should be undertaken if re-initiation of fingolimod is warranted. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported under fingolimod treatment since marketing authorisation (see section 4.8). PML is an opportunistic infection caused by John Cunningham virus (JCV), which may be fatal or result in severe disability. PML can only occur in the presence of a JCV infection. If JCV testing is undertaken, it should be considered that the influence of lymphopenia on the accuracy of anti -JCV antibody testing has not been studied in fingolimod -treated patients. It should also be noted that a negative anti-JCV antibody test does not preclude the possibility of subsequent JCV infection. Before initiating treatment with fingolimod, a baseline MRI should be available (usually within 3 months) as a reference. During routine MRI (in accordance with national and local recommendations), physicians should pay attention to PML suggestive lesions. MRI may be considered as part of increased vigilance in patients considered at increased risk of PML. If PML is suspected, MRI should be performed immediately for diagnostic purposes and treatment with fingolimod should be suspended until PML has been excluded. Elimination of fingolimod following discontinuation of therapy may take up to two months and vigilance for infection should therefore be continued throughout this period. Patients should be instructed to report symptoms of infection up to 2 months after discontinuation of fingolimod. Macular oedema Macular oedema with or without visual symptoms has been reported in 0.5% of patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg, occurring predominantly in the first 3-4 months of therapy (see section 4.8). An ophthalmological evaluation is therefore recommended at 3-4 months after treatment initiation. If patients report visual disturbances at any time while on therapy, evaluation of the fundus, including the macula, should be carried out. Patients with history of uveitis and patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of macular oedema (see section 4.8). Gilenya has not been studied in multiple sclerosis patients with concomitant diabetes mellitus. It is recommended that multiple sclerosis patients with diabetes mellitus or a history of uveitis undergo an ophthalmological evaluation prior to initiating therapy and have follow -up evaluations while receiving therapy. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 145/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Continuation of Gilenya in patients with macular oedema has not been evaluated. It is recommended that Gilenya be discontinued if a patient develops macular oedema. A decision on whether or not Gilenya therapy should be re-initiated after resolution of macular oedema needs to take into account the potential benefits and risks for the individual patient. Liver function Increased hepatic enzymes, in particular alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) but also gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) have been reported in multiple sclerosis patients treated with Gilenya. In clinical trials, elevations 3-fold the upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater in ALT occurred in 8.0% of patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg compared to 1.9% of placebo patients. Elevations 5-fold the ULN occurred in 1.8% of patients on fingolimod and 0.9% of patients on placebo. In clinical trials, fingolimod was discontinued if the elevation exceeded 5 times the ULN. Recurrence of liver transaminase elevations occurred with rechallenge in some patients, supporting a relationship to fingolimod. In clinical studies, transaminase elevations occurred at any time during treatment although the majority occurred within the first 12 months. Serum transaminase levels returned to normal within approximately 2 months after discontinuation of fingolimod. Gilenya has not been studied in patients with severe pre-existing hepatic injury (Child -Pugh class C) and should not be used in these patients (see section 4.3). Due to the immunosuppressive properties of fingolimod, initiation of treatment should be delayed in patients with active viral hepatitis until resolution. Recent (i.e. within last 6 months) transaminase and bilirubin levels should be available before initiation of treatment with Gilenya. In the absence of clinical symptoms, liver transaminases should be monitored at Months 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 on therapy and periodically thereafter. If liver transaminases rise above 5 times the ULN, more frequent monitoring should be instituted, including serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) measurement. With repeated confirmation of liver transaminases above 5 times the ULN, treatment with Gilenya should be interrupted and only re-commenced once liver transaminase values have normalised. Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia, or jaundice and/or dark urine, should have liver enzymes checked and Gilenya should be discontinued if significant liver injury is confirmed (for example liver transaminase levels greater than 5-fold the ULN and/or serum bilirubin elevations). Resumption of therapy will be dependent on whether or not another cause of liver injury is determined and on the benefits to patient of resuming therapy versus the risks of recurrence of liver dysfunction. Although there are no data to establish that patients with pre-existing liver disease are at increased risk of developing elevated liver function tests when taking Gilenya, caution in the use of Gilenya should be exercised in patients with a history of significant liver disease. Interference with serological testing Since fingolimod reduces blood lymphocyte counts via re-distribution in secondary lymphoid organs, peripheral blood lymphocyte counts cannot be utilised to evaluate the lymphocyte subset status of a patient treated with Gilenya. Laboratory tests involving the use of circulating mononuclear cells require larger blood volumes due to reduction in the number of circulating lymphocytes. Blood pressure effects Patients with hypertension uncontrolled by medication were excluded from participation in premarketing clinical trials and special care is indicated if patients with uncontrolled hypertension are treated with Gilenya. In MS clinical trials, patients treated with fingolimod 0.5 mg had an average increase of approximately 3 mmHg in systolic pressure, and approximately 1 mmHg in diastolic pressure, first detected approximately 1 month after treatment initiation, and persisting with continued treatment. In the two-year placebo - controlled study, hypertension was reported as an adverse event in 6.5% of patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg and in 3.3% of patients on placebo. Therefore, blood pressure should be regularly monitored during treatment with Gilenya. Respiratory effects Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 146/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Minor dose -dependent reductions in values for forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were observed with Gilenya treatment starting at Month 1 and remaining stable thereafter. Gilenya should be used with caution in patients with severe respiratory disease, pulmonary fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (see also section 4.8). Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome Rare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have been reported at the 0.5 mg dose in clinical trials and in the post-marketing setting (see section 4.8). Symptoms reported included sudden onset of severe headache, nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, visual disturbances and seizure. Symptoms of PRES are usually reversible but may evolve into ischaemic stroke or cerebral haemorrhage. Delay in diagnosis and treatment may lead to permanent neurological sequelae. If PRES is suspected, Gilenya should be discontinued. Prior treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies There have been no studies performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Gilenya when switching patients from teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate or alemtuzumab treatment to Gilenya. When switching patients from another disease modifying therapy to Gilenya, the half -life and mode of action of the other therapy must be considered in order to avoid an additive immune effect whilst at the same time minimising the risk of disease reactivation. A CBC is recommended prior to initiating Gilenya to ensure that immune effects of the previous therapy (i.e. cytopenia) have resolved. Gilenya can generally be started immediately after discontinuation of interferon or glatiramer acetate. For dimethyl fumarate, the washout period should be sufficient for CBC to recover before treatment with Gilenya is started. Due to the long half-life of natalizumab, elimination usually takes up to 2-3 months following discontinuation. Teriflunomide is also eliminated slowly from the plasma. Without an accelerated elimination procedure, clearance of teriflunomide from plasma can take from several months up to 2 years. An accelerated elimination procedure as defined in the teriflunomide summary of product characteristics is recommended or alternatively washout period should not be shorter than 3.5 months. Caution regarding potential concomitant immune effects is required when switching patients from natalizumab or teriflunomide to Gilenya. Alemtuzumab has profound and prolonged immunosuppressive effects. As the actual duration of these effects is unknown, initiating treatment with Gilenya after alemtuzumab is not recommended unless the benefits of such treatment clearly outweigh the risks for the individual patient. A decision to use prolonged concomitant treatment with corticosteroids should be taken after careful consideration. Co-administration with potent CYP450 inducers The combination of fingolimod with potent CYP450 inducers should be used with caution. Concomitant administration with St John's wort is not recommended (see section 4.5). Basal cell carcinoma Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has been reported in patients receiving Gilenya (see section 4.8). Vigilance for skin lesions is warranted and a medical evaluation of the skin is recommended at initiation, after at least one year and then at least yearly taking into consideration clinical judgement. The patient should be referred to a dermatologist in case suspicious lesions are detected. Stopping therapy If a decision is made to stop treatment with Gilenya a 6 week interval without therapy is needed, based on half-life, to clear fingolimod from the circulation (see section 5.2). Lymphocyte counts progressively return to normal range within 1-2 months of stopping therapy (see section 5.1). Starting other therapies during this interval will result in concomitant exposure to fingolimod. Use of immunosuppressants soon after the discontinuation of Gilenya may lead to an additive effect on the immune system and caution is therefore indicated. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Anti-neoplastic, immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies Ocrelizumab immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies should not be co-administered due to the risk of additive immune system effects (see sections 4.3 and 4.4). Caution should also be exercised when switching patients from long-acting therapies with immune effects such as natalizumab, teriflunomide or mitoxantrone (see section 4.4). In multiple sclerosis clinical studies the concomitant treatment of relapses with a short course of corticosteroids was not associated with an increased rate of infection. Vaccination During and for up to two months after treatment with Gilenya vaccination may be less effective. The use of live attenuated vaccines may carry a risk of infections and should therefore be avoided (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). Bradycardia -inducing substances Fingolimod has been studied in combination with atenolol and diltiazem. When fingolimod was used with atenolol in an interaction study in healthy volunteers, there was an additional 15% reduction of heart rate at fingolimod treatment initiation, an effect not seen with diltiazem. Treatment with Gilenya should not be initiated in patients receiving beta blockers, or other substances which may decrease heart rate, such as class Ia and III antiarrhythmics, calcium channel blockers (such as ivabradine, verapamil or diltiazem), anticholinesteratic agents or pilocarpine because of the potential additive effects on heart rate (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). If treatment with Gilenya is considered in such patients, advice from a cardiologist should be sought regarding the switch to non heart -rate lowering medicinal products or appropriate monitoring for treatment initiation, at least overnight monitoring is recommended, if the heart - rate-lowering medication cannot be stopped. Pharmacokinetic interactions of other substances on fingolimod Fingolimod is metabolised mainly by CYP4F2. Other enzymes like CYP3A4 may also contribute to its metabolism, notably in the case of strong induction of CYP3A4. Potent inhibitors of transporter proteins are not expected to influence fingolimod disposition. Co-administration of fingolimod with ketoconazole resulted in a 1.7-fold increase in fingolimod and fingolimod phosphate exposure (AUC) by inhibition of CYP4F2. Caution should be exercised with substances that may inhibit CYP3A4 (protease inhibitors, azole antifungals, telithromycin). Co-administration of carbamazepine 600 mg twice daily at steady -state and a single dose of fingolimod 2 mg reduced the AUC of fingolimod and its metabolite by approximately may reduce the AUC of fingolimod and its metabolite at least to this extent. As this could potentially impair the efficacy, their co-administration should be used with caution. Concomitant administration with St. John's Wort is however not recommended (see section 4.4). Pharmacokinetic interactions of fingolimod on other substances Fingolimod is unlikely to interact with substances mainly cleared by the CYP450 enzymes or by substrates of the main transporter proteins. Co-administration of fingolimod with ciclosporin did not elicit any change in the ciclosporin or fingolimod exposure. Therefore, fingolimod is not expected to alter the pharmacokinetics of medicinal products that are CYP3A4 substrates. Co-administration of fingolimod with oral contraceptives (ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel) did not elicit any change in oral contraceptive exposure. No interaction studies have been performed with oral contraceptives containing other progestagens, however an effect of fingolimod on their exposure is not expected. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in females Before initiation of Gilenya treatment, women of childbearing potential should be counselled regarding the potential for serious risk to the foetus and the need for effective contraception during treatment with Gilenya. Since it takes approximately two months to eliminate fingolimod from the body on stopping treatment (see section 4.4), the potential risk to the foetus may persist and contraception should be continued during that period. Pregnancy Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 148/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Before initiation of treatment in women of childbearing potential a negative pregnancy test result needs to be available. While on treatment, women should not become pregnant and active contraception is recommended. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking Gilenya, discontinuation of Gilenya is recommended. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity including foetal loss and organ defects, notably persistent truncus arteriosus and ventricular septal defect (see section 5.3). Furthermore, the receptor affected by fingolimod (sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor) is known to be involved in vascular formation during embryogenesis. There are very limited data from the use of fingolimod in pregnant women. There are no data on the effects of fingolimod on labour and delivery. Breast -feeding Fingolimod is excreted in milk of treated animals during lactation at concentrations 2-3-fold higher than that found in maternal plasma (see section 5.3). Due to the potential for serious adverse reactions to fingolimod in nursing infants, women receiving Gilenya should not breastfeed. Fertility Data from preclinical studies do not suggest that fingolimod would be associated with an increased risk of reduced fertility (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Gilenya has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, dizziness or drowsiness may occasionally occur when initiating therapy with Gilenya. On initiation of Gilenya treatment it is recommended that patients be observed for a period of 6 hours (see section 4.4, Bradyarrhythmia). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The safety population of Gilenya is derived from two Phase III placebo -controlled clinical studies and one Phase III active -controlled clinical study in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. It includes a total of 2,431 patients on Gilenya (0.5 or 1.25 mg). Study D2301 (FREEDOMS) was a 2- year placebo -controlled clinical study in 854 patients treated with fingolimod (placebo: 418). Study D2309 (FREEDOMS II) was a 2-year placebo -controlled clinical study in 728 multiple sclerosis patients treated with fingolimod (placebo: 355). In the pooled data from these two studies the most serious adverse reactions on Gilenya 0.5 mg were infections, macular oedema and transient atrioventricular block at treatment initiation. The most frequent adverse reactions (incidence 10%) on Gilenya 0.5 mg were influenza, sinusitis, headache, diarrhoea, back pain, hepatic enzyme increased and cough. The most frequent adverse reaction reported for Gilenya 0.5 mg leading to treatment interruption was ALT elevations (2.2%). The adverse reactions in Study D2302 (TRANSFORMS), a 1- year study in 849 patients treated with fingolimod which used interferon beta-1a as comparator, were generally similar to placebo -controlled studies, taking into account the differences in study duration. Adverse reactions reported with Gilenya 0.5 mg in Studies D2301 (FREEDOMS) and D2309 (FREEDOMS II) are shown below. Frequencies were defined using the following convention: very common (1/10); common (1/100 to <1/10); uncommon <1/100); rare (1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Tabulated list of adverse reactions Infections and infestations Very Ocrelizumab Lymphopenia Peripheral oedema system known***: Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, urticaria and angioedema upon treatment initiation Psychiatric disorders Common: Depression Uncommon: Depressed mood Nervous system disorders Very common: Common: Dizziness Migraine Rare*: Posterior Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Very common: Back pain General disorders and administration site conditions Common: Asthenia Investigations Very common: Blood triglycerides increased Uncommon: Neutrophil count decreased * Not reported in Studies FREEDOMS, FREEDOMS II and TRANSFORMS. The frequency category was based on an estimated exposure of approximately 10, 000 patients to fingolimod in all clinical trials. ** PML and cryptococcal infections (including isolated cases of cryptococcal meningitis) have been reported in the post-marketing setting (see section 4.4). Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 150/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 *** Adverse drug reactions from spontaneous reports and literature Description of selected adverse reactions Infections In multiple sclerosis clinical studies the overall rate of infections (65.1%) at the 0.5 mg dose was similar to placebo. However, lower respiratory tract infections, primarily bronchitis and to a lesser extent herpes infection and pneumonia were more common in Gilenya -treated patients. Some cases of disseminated herpes infection, including fatal cases, have been reported even at the 0.5 mg dose. In the post-marketing setting, cases of infections with opportunistic pathogens, such as viral (e.g. varicella zoster virus [VZV], bacterial (e.g. mycobacterium), have been reported (see section 4.4). Macular oedema In multiple sclerosis clinical studies macular oedema occurred in 0.5% of patients treated with the recommended dose of 0.5 mg and 1.1% of patients treated with the higher dose of 1.25 mg. The majority of cases occurred within the first 3-4 months of therapy. Some patients presented with blurred vision or decreased visual acuity, but others were asymptomatic and diagnosed on routine ophthalmological examination. The macular oedema generally improved or resolved spontaneously after discontinuation of Gilenya. The risk of recurrence after re-challenge has not been evaluated. Macular oedema incidence is increased in multiple sclerosis patients with a history of uveitis (17% with a history of uveitis vs. 0.6% without a history of uveitis). Gilenya has not been studied in multiple sclerosis patients with diabetes mellitus, a disease which is associated with an increased risk for macular oedema (see section 4.4). In renal transplant clinical studies in which patients with diabetes mellitus were included, therapy with fingolimod 2.5 mg and 5 mg resulted in a 2-fold increase in the incidence of macular oedema. Bradyarrhythmia Initiation of Gilenya treatment results in a transient decrease in heart rate and may also be associated with atrioventricular conduction delays. In multiple sclerosis clinical studies the maximal decline in heart rate was seen within 6 hours after treatment initiation, with declines in mean heart rate of 12-13 beats per minute for Gilenya 0.5 mg. Heart rate below 40 beats per minute was rarely observed in patients on Gilenya 0.5 mg. The average heart rate returned towards baseline within 1 month of chronic treatment. Bradycardia was generally asymptomatic but some patients experienced mild to moderate symptoms, including hypotension, dizziness, fatigue and/or palpitations, which resolved within the first 24 hours after treatment initiation (see also sections 4.4 and 5.1). In multiple sclerosis clinical studies first-degree atrioventricular block (prolonged PR interval on ECG) was detected after treatment initiation in 4.7% of patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg, in 2.8% of patients on intramuscular interferon beta -1a, and in 1.6% of patients on placebo. Second -degree atrioventricular block was detected in less than 0.2% patients on Gilenya 0.5 mg. In the post - marketing setting, isolated reports of transient, spontaneously resolving complete AV block have been observed during the six hour monitoring period following the first dose of Gilenya. The patients recovered spontaneously. The conduction abnormalities observed both in clinical trials and post - marketing were typically transient, asymptomatic and resolved within the first 24 hours after treatment initiation. Although most patients did not require medical intervention, one patient on Gilenya 0.5 mg received isoprenaline for asymptomatic second -degree Mobitz I atrioventricular block. In the post-marketing setting, isolated delayed onset events, including transient asystole and unexplained death, have occurred within 24 hours of the first dose. These cases have been confounded by concomitant medicinal products and/or pre-existing disease. The relationship of such events to Gilenya is uncertain. Blood pressure In multiple sclerosis clinical studies Gilenya 0.5 mg was associated with an average increase of approximately 3 mmHg in systolic pressure and approximately 1 mmHg in diastolic pressure, manifesting approximately 1 month after treatment initiation. This increase persisted with continued treatment. Hypertension was reported in 6.5% of patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg and in 3.3% of patients on placebo. In the post-marketing setting, cases of hypertension have been reported within the first month of treatment Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 151/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 initiation and on the first day of treatment that may require treatment with antihypertensive agents or discontinuation of Gilenya (see also section 4.4, Blood pressure effects). Liver function Increased hepatic enzymes have been reported in multiple sclerosis patients treated with Gilenya. In clinical studies 8.0% and 1.8% of patients treated with Gilenya 0.5 mg experienced an asymptomatic elevation in serum levels of ALT of 3x ULN (upper limit of normal) and 5x ULN, respectively. Recurrence of liver transaminase elevations has occurred upon re-challenge in some patients, supporting a relationship to the medicinal product. In clinical studies, transaminase elevations occurred at any time during treatment although the majority occurred within the first 12 months. ALT levels returned to normal within approximately 2 months after discontinuation of Gilenya. In a small number of patients (N=10 on 1.25 mg, N=2 on 0.5 mg) who experienced ALT elevations 5x ULN and who continued on Gilenya therapy, the ALT levels returned to normal within approximately 5 months (see also section 4.4, Liver function). Nervous system disorders In clinical studies, rare events involving the nervous system occurred in patients treated with fingolimod at higher doses (1.25 or 5.0 mg) including ischaemic and haemorrhagic strokes and neurological atypical disorders, such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) -like events. Vascular disorders Rare cases of peripheral arterial occlusive disease occurred in patients treated with fingolimod at higher doses (1.25 mg). Respiratory system Minor dose -dependent reductions in values for forced expiratory volume (FEV 1) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were observed with Gilenya treatment starting at Month 1 and remaining stable thereafter. At Month 24, the reduction from baseline values in percentage of predicted FEV1 was 2.7% for fingolimod 0.5 mg and 1.2% for placebo, a difference that resolved after treatment discontinuation. For DLCO the reductions at Month 24 were 3.3% for fingolimod 0.5 mg and 2.7% for placebo. Lymphomas There have been cases of lymphoma of different varieties, in both clinical studies and the post - marketing setting, including a fatal case of Epstein -Barr virus (EBV) positive B-cell lymphoma. The incidence of lymphoma (B-cell and T-cell) cases was higher in clinical trials than expected in the general population. Haemophagocytic syndrome Very rare cases of haemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) with fatal outcome have been reported in patients treated with fingolimod in the context of an infection. HPS is a rare condition that has been described in association with infections, immunosuppression and a variety of autoimmune diseases. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose Single doses up to 80 times the recommended dose (0.5 mg) were well tolerated in healthy volunteers. At 40 mg, 5 of 6 subjects reported mild chest tightness or discomfort which was clinically consistent with small airway reactivity. Fingolimod can induce bradycardia upon treatment initiation. The decline in heart rate usually starts within one hour of the first dose, and is steepest within 6 hours. The negative chronotropic effect of Gilenya persists beyond 6 hours and progressively attenuates over subsequent days of treatment (see section 4.4 for details). There have been reports of slow atrioventricular conduction, with isolated reports of transient, spontaneously resolving complete AV block (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). If the overdose constitutes first exposure to Gilenya, it is important to monitor patients with a continuous (real time) ECG and hourly measurement of heart rate and blood pressure, at least during the first 6 hours (see section 4.4). Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 152/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Additionally, if after 6 hours the heart rate is <45 bpm or if the ECG at 6 hours after the first dose shows second degree or higher AV block, or if it shows a QTc interval 500 msec, monitoring should be extended at least for overnight and until the findings have resolved. The occurrence at any time of third degree AV block should also lead to extended monitoring including overnight monitoring. Neither dialysis nor plasma exchange results in removal of fingolimod from the body. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Selective immunosuppressants, fingolimod phosphate. at low nanomolar concentrations to sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 located on lymphocytes, and readily crosses the blood -brain barrier to bind to S1P receptor 1 located on neural cells in the central nervous system (CNS). By acting as a functional antagonist of S1P receptors on lymphocytes, fingolimod phosphate blocks the capacity of lymphocytes to egress from lymph nodes, causing a redistribution, rather than depletion, of lymphocytes. Animal studies have shown that this redistribution reduces the infiltration of pathogenic lymphocytes, including pro-inflammatory Th17 cells, into the CNS, where they would be involved in nerve inflammation and nervous tissue damage. Animal studies and in vitro experiments indicate that fingolimod may also act via interaction with S1P receptors on neural cells. Pharmacodynamic effects Within 4-6 hours after the first dose of fingolimod 0.5 mg, the lymphocyte count decreases to approximately 75% of baseline in peripheral blood. With continued daily dosing, the lymphocyte count continues to decrease over a two-week period, reaching a minimal count of approximately 500 cells/microlitre or approximately 30% of baseline. Eighteen percent of patients reached a minimal count below 200 cells/microlitre on at least one occasion. Low lymphocyte counts are maintained with chronic daily dosing. The majority of T and B lymphocytes regularly traffic through lymphoid organs and these are the cells mainly affected by fingolimod. Approximately 15-20% of T lymphocytes have an effector memory phenotype, cells that are important for peripheral immune surveillance. Since this lymphocyte subset typically does not traffic to lymphoid organs it is not affected by fingolimod. Peripheral lymphocyte count increases are evident within days of stopping fingolimod treatment and typically normal counts are reached within one to two months. Chronic fingolimod dosing leads to a mild decrease in the neutrophil count to approximately 80% of baseline. Monocytes are unaffected by fingolimod. Fingolimod causes a transient reduction in heart rate and decrease in atrioventricular conduction at treatment initiation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). The maximal decline in heart rate is seen within 6 hours post dose, with 70% of the negative chronotropic effect achieved on the first day. With continued administration heart rate returns to baseline within one month. The decrease in heart rate induced by fingolimod can be reversed by parenteral doses of atropine or isoprenaline. Inhaled salmeterol has also been shown to have a modest positive chronotropic effect. With initiation of fingolimod treatment there is an increase in atrial premature contractions, but there is no increased rate of atrial fibrilla tion/flutter or ventricular arrhythmias or ectopy. Fingolimod treatment is not associated with a decrease in cardiac output. Autonomic responses of the heart, including diurnal variation of heart rate and response to exercise are not affected by fingolimod treatment. Fingolimod treatment with single or multiple doses of 0.5 and 1.25 mg for two weeks is not associated with a detectable increase in airway resistance as measured by FEV1 and forced expiratory flow rate (FEF) 25-75. However, single fingolimod doses 5 mg (10-fold the recommended dose) are associated with a dose -dependent increase in airway resistance. Fingolimod treatment with multiple doses of 0.5, 1.25, or 5 mg is not associated with impaired oxygenation or oxygen desaturation with exercise or an increase in airway responsiveness to methacholine. Subjects on fingolimod treatment have a normal bronchodilator response to inhaled beta-agonists. Clinical efficacy and safety The efficacy of Gilenya has been demonstrated in two studies which evaluated once -daily doses of fingolimod 0.5 mg and 1.25 mg in patients with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Both studies included patients who had experienced 2 relapses in the prior 2 years or 1 relapse during the prior year. Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS) was between 0 and 5.5. A third study targeting the same patient population was completed after registration of Gilenya. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 153/Protocol (FREEDOMS) was a 2-year randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase III study of 1,272 patients (n=425 on 0.5 mg, 429 on 1.25 mg, 418 on placebo). Median values for baseline characteristics were: age 37 years, disease duration 6.7 years, and EDSS score 2.0. Outcome results are shown in Table 1. There were no significant differ ences between the 0.5 mg and the 1.25 mg doses as regards either endpoint.

MRI analyses used evaluable dataset. Patients who completed the 24-month core FREEDOMS study could enter a dose -blinded extension study (D2301E1) and receive fingolimod. In total, 920 patients entered (n=331 continued on 0.5 mg, 289 continued on 1.25 mg, 155 switched from placebo to 0.5 mg and 145 switched from placebo to 1.25 mg). After 12 months (month 36), 856 patients (93%) were still enrolled. Between months 24 and 36, the annualised relapse rate (ARR) for patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core study who remained on 0.5 mg was 0.17 (0.21 in the core study). The ARR for patients who switched from placebo to fingolimod 0.5 mg was 0.22 (0.42 in the core study). Comparable results were shown in a replicate 2-year randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled Phase III study on fingolimod in 1,083 patients (n=358 on 0.5 mg, 370 on 1.25 mg, 355 on placebo) with RRMS (D2309; FREEDOMS 2). Median values for baseline characteristics were: age 41 years, disease duration 8.9 years, EDSS score 2.5.

Study D2302 (TRANSFORMS) was a 1-year randomised, double -blind, double -dummy, active (interferon beta-1a)-controlled Phase III study of 1,280 patients (n=429 on 0.5 mg, 420 on 1.25 mg, 431 on interferon beta-1a, 30 \u00b5g by intramuscular injection once weekly). Median values for baseline characteristics were: age 36 years, disease duration 5.9 years, and EDSS score 2.0. Outcome results are shown in Table 3. There were no significant differences between the 0.5 mg and the 1.25 mg doses as regards study endpoints.

MRI analyses used evaluable dataset. Patients who completed the 12-month core TRANSFORMS study could enter a dose -blinded extension (D2302E1) and receive fingolimod. In total, 1,030 patients entered, however, 3 of these patients did not receive treatment (n=356 continued on 0.5 mg, 330 continued on 1.25 mg, 167 switched from interferon beta-1a to 0.5 mg and 174 from interferon beta-1a to 1.25 mg). After 12 months (month 24), 882 patients (86%) were still enrolled. Between months 12 and 24, the ARR for patients on fingolimod 0.5 mg in the core study who remained on 0.5 mg was 0.20 (0.19 in the core study). The ARR for patients who switched from interferon beta -1a to fingolimod 0.5 mg was 0.33 (0.48 in the core study). Pooled results of Studies D2301 and D2302 showed a consistent and statistically significant reduction in annualised relapse rate compared to comparator in subgroups defined by gender, age, prior multiple sclerosis therapy, disease activity or disability levels at baseline. Further analyses of clinical trial data demonstrate consistent treatment effects in highly active subgroups of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis patients. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 155/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Gilenya in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Pharmacokinetic data were obtained in healthy volunteers, in renal transplant patients and in multiple sclerosis patients. The pharmacologically active metabolite responsible for efficacy is fingolimod phosphate. Absorption Fingolimod absorption is slow (tmax of 12-16 hours) and extensive (85%). The apparent absolute 93% (95% confidence interval: 79-111%). Steady -state -blood concentrations are reached within 1 to 2 months following once -daily administration and steady -state levels are approximately 10-fold greater than with the initial dose. Food intake does not alter Cmax or exposure (AUC) of fingolimod. Fingolimod phosphate Cmax was slightly increased by 34% but AUC was unchanged. Therefore, Gilenya may be taken without regard to meals (see section 4.2). Distribution Fingolimod highly distributes in red blood cells, with the fraction in blood cells of 86%. Fingolimod phosphate has a smaller uptake in blood cells of <17%. Fingolimod and fingolimod phosphate are highly protein bound (>99%). Fingolimod is extensively distributed to body tissues with a volume of distribution of about 1,200 260 litres. A study in four healthy subjects who received a single intravenous dose of a radioiodolabelled analogue of fingolimod demonstrated that fingolimod penetrates into the brain. In a study in 13 male multiple sclerosis patients who received Gilenya 0.5 mg/day, the mean amount of fingolimod (and fingolimod phosphate) in seminal ejaculate, at steady -state, was approximately 10,000 times lower than the oral dose administered (0.5 mg). Biotransformation Fingolimod is transformed in humans by reversible stereoselective phosphorylation to the pharmacologically active (S)-enantiomer eliminated by biotransformation catalysed mainly CYP4F2 and possibly was also observed. The main enzyme involved in the metabolism of fingolimod is partially identified and may be either CYP4F2 or CYP3A4. Following single oral administration of [14C] fingolimod, the major fingolimod -related components in blood, as judged from their contribution to the AUC up to 34 days post dose of total radiolabelled components, are fingolimod clearance is 6.3 2.3 l/h, and the average apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2) is 6-9 days. Blood levels of fingolimod and fingolimod phosphate decline in parallel in the terminal phase, leading to similar half-lives for both. After oral administration, about 81% of the dose is slowly excreted in the urine as inactive metabolites. Fingolimod and fingolimod phosphate are not excreted intact in urine but are the major components in the faeces, with amounts representing less than 2.5% of the dose each. After 34 days, the recovery of the administered dose is 89%. Linearity Fingolimod and fingolimod phosphate concentrations increase in an apparently dose proportional manner after multiple once -daily doses of 0.5 mg or 1.25 mg. Characteristics in specific groups of patients The pharmacokinetics of fingolimod and fingolimod phosphate do not differ in males and females, in patients of different ethnic origin, or in patients with mild to severe renal impairment. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 156/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 In subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh class A, B, and C), no change in fingolimod Cmax was observed, but fingolimod AUC was increased respectively by 12%, 44%, and 103%. In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh class C), fingolimod - phosphate Cmax was decreased by 22% and AUC was not substantially changed. The pharmacokinetics of fingolimod - phosphate were not evaluated in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. The apparent elimination half-life of fingolimod is unchanged in subjects with mild hepatic impairment, but is prolonged by about 50% in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. Fingolimod should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh class C) (see section 4.3). Fingolimod should be introduced cautiously in mild and moderate hepatic impaired patients (see section 4.2). Clinical experience and pharmacokinetic information in patients aged above 65 years are limited. Gilenya should be used with caution in patients aged 65 years and over (see section 4.2). Paediatric population There are limited data available from a renal transplant study that included 7 children above 11 years of age (study FTY720A0115). The comparison of these data to those in adult healthy volunteers is of limited relevance and no valid conclusions can be drawn regarding the pharmacokinetic properties of fingolimod in children. 5.3 Preclinical safety data The preclinical safety profile of fingolimod was assessed in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. The major target organs were the lymphoid system (lymphopenia and lymphoid atrophy), lungs (increased weight, smooth muscle hypertrophy at the bronchio -alveolar junction), and heart (negative chronotropic effect, increase in blood pressure, perivascular changes and myocardial degeneration) in several species; blood vessels (vasculopathy) in rats only at doses of 0.15 mg/kg and higher in a 2 - year study, representing an approximate 4-fold margin based on the human systemic exposure (AUC) at a daily dose of 0.5 mg. No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in a 2-year bioassay in rats at oral doses of fingolimod up to the maximally tolerated dose of 2.5 mg/kg, representing an approximate 50-fold margin based on human systemic exposure (AUC) at the 0.5 mg dose. However, in a 2-year mouse study, an increased incidence of malignant lymphoma was seen at doses of 0.25 mg/kg and higher, representing an approximate 6-fold margin based on the human systemic exposure (AUC) at a daily dose of 0.5 mg. Fingolimod was neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in animal studies. Fingolimod had no effect on sperm count/motility or on fertility in male and female rats up to the highest dose tested (10 mg/kg), representing an approximate 150-fold margin based on human systemic exposure (AUC) at a daily dose of 0.5 mg. Fingolimod was teratogenic in the rat when given at doses of 0.1 mg/kg or higher. The most common foetal visceral malformations truncus arteriosus and ventricular septum defect. The teratogenic potential in rabbits could not be fully assessed, however an increased embryo -foetal mortality was seen at doses of 1.5 mg/kg and higher, and a decrease in viable foetuses as well as foetal growth retardation was seen at 5 mg/kg. In rats, F1 generation pup survival was decreased in the early postpartum period at doses that did not cause maternal toxicity. However, F1 body weights, development, behaviour, and fertility were not affected by treatment with fingolimod. Fingolimod was excreted in milk of treated animals during lactation. Fingolimod and its metabolites crossed the placental barrier in pregnant rabbits. Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) A risk for the environment due to use of Gilenya by patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis is not expected. 6. PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS Ocrelizumab \u2014F.

Excipients with known effect Each syringe contains 0.13 mg sodium. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection (injection). Clear and colourless solution with pH 4.5-5.1. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Plegridy is indicated in adult patients for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (see section 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Efficacy of Plegridy has been demonstrated over placebo. Direct comparative data for Plegridy versus non- pegylated interferon beta or data on efficacy of Plegridy after switching from a non-pegylated interferon beta are not available. This should be considered when switching patients between pegylated and non- pegylated interferons. Please refer also to section 5.1. Posology The recommended dosage of Plegridy is 125 micrograms injected subcutaneously every 2 weeks (14 days). Treatment initiation Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 160/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 It is generally recommended that patients start treatment with 63 micrograms at dose 1 (on day 0), increasing to 94 micrograms at dose 2 (on day 14), reaching the full dose of 125 micrograms by dose 3 (on day 28) and continuing with the full dose (125 micrograms) every 2 weeks (14 days) thereafter (see Table 1). An Initiation Pack is available containing the first 2 doses (63 micrograms and 94 micrograms). Table 1: Titration schedule at initiation Dose Time* Amount (micrograms) Syringe label Dose 1 Day 0 63 Orange Dose 2 Day 14 94 Blue Dose 3 Day 28 125 (full dose) Grey *Dosed every 2 weeks (14 days) Dose titration at the initiation of treatment may help to ameliorate flu-like symptoms that can occur at treatment initiation with interferons. Prophylactic and concurrent use of anti-inflammatory, analgesic and/or antipyretic treatments may prevent or ameliorate flu-like symptoms sometimes experienced during interferon treatment (see section 4.8). If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible. If 7 days or more to the next planned dose: Patients should administer their missed dose immediately. Treatment can then continue with the next scheduled dose as planned. If less than 7 days to the next planned dose: Patients should begin a new 2 week dosing schedule starting from when they administer their missed dose. A patient should not administer two doses of Plegridy within 7 days of each other. Special populations Elderly population The safety and efficacy of Plegridy in patients over the age of 65 have not been sufficiently studied due to the limited number of such patients included in clinical trials. Renal impairment No dosage adjustments are necessary in patients with renal impairment based on study data in mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and end stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). Hepatic impairment Plegridy has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Plegridy in children and adolescents aged 0 to 18 years have not been established in multiple sclerosis. No data are available. Method of administration Plegridy is for subcutaneous use. It is recommended that a healthcare professional trains patients in the proper technique for self- administering subcutaneous injections using the pre-filled syringe. Patients should be advised to rotate sites for subcutaneous injections. The usual sites for subcutaneous injections include abdomen, arm, and thigh. Each Plegridy pre-filled syringe is provided with the needle pre-attached. Pre-filled syringes are for single use only and should be discarded after use. Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 161/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Once removed from the refrigerator, Plegridy should be allowed to warm to room temperature (about 30 minutes) prior to injection. External heat sources such as hot water must not be used to warm Plegridy. Plegridy pre-filled syringe must not be used if the liquid is coloured, cloudy, or contains floating particles. The liquid in the syringe must be clear and colourless. 4.3 Contraindications - Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or peginterferon or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. - Initiation of treatment in pregnancy (see section 4.6). - Patients with current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Hepatic injury Elevated serum hepatic transaminase levels, hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis and rare cases of severe hepatic failure have been reported with interferon beta medicinal products. Elevations in hepatic enzymes have been observed with the use of Plegridy. Patients should be monitored for signs of hepatic injury (see section 4.8). Depression Plegridy should be administered with caution to patients with previous depressive disorders (see section 4.3). Depression occurs with increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in association with interferon use. Patients should be advised to immediately report any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy and treated appropriately. Cessation of therapy with Plegridy should be considered (see section 4.8). Hypersensitivity reactions Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported as a rare complication of treatment with interferon beta, including Plegridy. Peginterferon beta-1a should be discontinued if serious hypersensitivity reactions occur (see section 4.8). Injection site reactions Injection site reactions, including injection site necrosis, have been reported with the use of subcutaneous interferon beta. To minimise the risk of injection site reactions patients should be instructed in the use of an aseptic injection technique. The procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especially if injection site reactions have occurred. If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be accompanied by swelling or drainage of fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to speak with their doctor. One patient treated with Plegridy in clinical trials experienced an injection site necrosis. Whether to discontinue therapy following a single site of necrosis is dependent on the extent of necrosis (see section 4.8). Decreased peripheral blood counts Decreased peripheral blood counts in all cell lines, including rare pancytopenia and severe thrombocytopenia, have been reported in patients receiving interferon beta. Cytopenias, including rare severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, have been observed in patients treated with Plegridy. Patients should be monitored for symptoms or signs of decreased peripheral blood counts (see section 4.8). Renal and urinary disorders Nephrotic syndrome Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 162/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and discontinuation of treatment with Plegridy should be considered. Severe renal impairment Caution should be used when administering Plegridy to patients with severe renal impairment. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) Cases of TMA, manifested as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension, fever, central nervous system symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of Plegridy is recommended. Laboratory abnormalities Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. In addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, complete blood and differential blood cell counts, platelet counts, and blood chemistries, including liver function tests (e.g. aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransaminase (ALT)), are recommended prior to initiation and at regular intervals following introduction of Plegridy therapy and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms. Patients with myelosuppression may require more intensive monitoring of complete blood cell counts, with differential and platelet counts. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism have been observed with the use of interferon beta products. Regular thyroid function tests are recommended in patients with a history of thyroid dysfunction or as clinically indicated. Seizure Plegridy should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with anti-epileptics (see section 4.8). Cardiac disease Worsening of cardiac disease has been reported in patients receiving interferon beta. The incidence of cardiovascular events was similar between Plegridy (125 micrograms every 2 weeks) and placebo treatment groups (7% in each group). No serious cardiovascular events were reported in patients who received Plegridy in the ADVANCE study. Nevertheless, patients with pre-existing significant cardiac disease, such as congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease or arrhythmia should be monitored for worsening of their cardiac condition, particularly during initiation of treatment. Immunogenicity Patients may develop antibodies to Plegridy. Data from patients treated up to 2 years with Plegridy suggests that less than 1% (5/715) developed persistent -neutralising antibodies to the interferon beta-1a portion of peginterferon beta-1a. Neutralising antibodies have the potential to reduce clinical efficacy. However, the development of antibodies against the interferon moiety of peginterferon beta-1a had no discernible impact on safety or clinical efficacy, although the analysis was limited by the low immunogenicity incidence. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 163/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 3% of patients (18/681) developed persistent antibodies to the PEG moiety of peginterferon beta-1a. In the clinical study conducted, the development of antibodies against the PEG moiety of peginterferon beta-1a had no discernible impact on safety, or clinical efficacy (including annualised relapse rate, MRI lesions, and disability progression). Hepatic impairment Caution should be used and close monitoring considered when administering Plegridy to patients with severe hepatic impairment. Patients should be monitored for signs of hepatic injury and caution exercised when interferons are used concomitantly with other medicinal products associated with hepatic injury (see sections 4.8 and 5.2). Sodium content Each syringe contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium and is therefore considered essentially \"sodium - free\". 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed. The clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Plegridy and corticosteroids during relapses. Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 -dependent enzymes in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when Plegridy is administered in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. some classes of antiepileptics and antidepressants. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of child-bearing potential Women of child-bearing potential have to take appropriate contraceptive measures. If the patient becomes pregnant or plans to become pregnant while taking Plegridy she should be informed of the potential hazards and discontinuation of therapy should be considered (see section 5.3). In patients with a high relapse rate before treatment started, the risk of a severe relapse following discontinuation of Plegridy in the event of pregnancy should be weighed against a possible increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Pregnancy There is limited information on the use of Plegridy in pregnancy. Available data indicates that there may be an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Initiation of treatment is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Breast -feeding It is not known whether peginferferon beta-1a is secreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast -feeding infants, a decision should be made either to discontinue breast -feeding or Plegridy therapy. Fertility There are no data on the effects of peginferferon beta-1a on human fertility. In animals, anovulatory effects were observed at very high doses (see section 5.3). No information is available on the effects of peginterferon beta-1a on male fertility in animals. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Central nervous system -related adverse events associated with the use of interferon beta might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of safety profile The most common adverse drug reactions (ADR) (at a higher incidence than placebo) for Plegridy Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 164/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 125 micrograms subcutaneously every 2 weeks were injection site erythema, influenza like illness, pyrexia, headache, myalgia, chills, injection site pain, asthenia, injection site pruritus, and arthralgia. The most commonly reported adverse reaction leading to discontinuation in patients treated with Plegridy 125 micrograms subcutaneously every 2 weeks was influenza -like illness (<1%). Tabulated list of adverse reactions In clinical studies 1468 patients received Plegridy for up to 177 weeks (overall exposure equivalent to 1932 person -years). 1093 patients received at least 1 year, and 415 patients have received at least 2 years of treatment with Plegridy. The experience in the randomised, uncontrolled phase (year 2) of the ADVANCE study and in the 2 year safety extension study ATTAIN was consistent with the experience in the 1 year placebo -controlled phase of the ADVANCE study. The table summarizes ADRs (incidence above placebo and with a reasonable possibility of causality) from 512 patients treated with Plegridy 125 micrograms subcutaneously every 2 weeks and 500 patients who received placebo for up to 48 weeks. The ADRs are presented as MedDRA preferred terms under the MedDRA System Organ Class. The incidence of the adverse reactions below are expressed according to the following categories: Very common (1/10) - Common (1/100 to <1/10) - Uncommon (1/1, 000 to <1/100) - Rare (1/10, 000 to <1/1,000) - Very rare (<1/10,000) - Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) MedDRA System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequency category Blood and lymphatic system disorders Immune system disorders Hypersensitivity reaction Uncommon Nervous system disorders Headache Very common Seizure Uncommon Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders Pulmonary arterial hypertension Not known Gastrointestinal disorders Nausea Common Vomiting Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders Pruritus Common Urticaria Uncommon Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Myalgia common Arthralgia Renal and urinary disorders Nephrotic syndrome, glomerulosclerosis Rare General disorders and administration site conditions Injection site erythema Very common Influenza like illness Pyrexia Chills Injection site pain Asthenia Injection site pruritus Hyperthermia Common Pain Injection site oedema Injection site warmth Injection site haematoma Injection site rash Injection site swelling Ocrelizumab \u2014F.

Class label for interferon products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension Description of selected adverse reactions Flu-like symptoms Influenza -like illness was experienced by 47% of patients receiving Plegridy 125 micrograms every 2 weeks and 13% of patients receiving placebo. The incidence of flu-like symptoms (e.g. influenza -like illness, chills, hyperpyrexia, musculoskeletal pain, myalgia, pain, pyrexia) was highest at the initiation of treatment and generally decreased over the first 6 months. Of the patients who reported flu-like symptoms 90% reported them as mild or moderate in severity. None were considered serious in nature. Less than 1% of patients who received Plegridy during the placebo controlled phase of the ADVANCE study discontinued treatment due to flu-like symptoms. Injection site reactions Injection site reactions (e.g. injection site erythema, pain, pruritus, or oedema) were reported by 66% of patients who received Plegridy 125 micrograms every 2 weeks compared to 11% of patients receiving placebo. Injection site erythema was the most commonly reported injection site reaction. Of the patients who experienced injection site reactions 95% reported them as mild or moderate in severity. One patient out of 1468 patients who received Plegridy in clinical studies experienced an injection site necrosis which resolved with standard medical treatment. Hepatic transaminase abnormalities The incidence of hepatic transaminase increases was greater in patients receiving Plegridy compared to placebo. The majority of enzyme elevations were <3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). Elevations of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate of placebo -treated patients and 2% and <1% of patients treated with Plegridy respectively. Elevations of serum hepatic transaminases combined with elevated bilirubin were observed in two patients who had pre-existing liver test abnormalities prior to receiving Plegridy in the clinical trials. Both cases resolved following discontinuation of Plegridy. Haematological disorders Decreases in white blood cell counts of <3.0 x 109/L were observed in 7% of patients receiving Plegridy and in 1% receiving placebo. Mean white blood cell counts remained within normal limits in patients treated with Plegridy. Decreases in white blood cell counts were not associated with an increased risk of infections or serious infections. The incidence of potentially clinically significant decreases in lymphocyte counts (<0.5 x 109/L) (<1%), neutrophil counts 109/L) ( 1%) similar in Plegridy -treated patients compared to placebo -treated patients. Two serious cases were reported in patients treated with Plegridy: one patient (<1%) experienced severe thrombocytopenia severe neutropenia (neutrophil count <0.5 x 109/L). In both patients, cell counts recovered after discontinuation of Plegridy. Slight decreases in mean red blood cell (RBC) counts were observed in Plegridy treated patients. The incidence of potentially clinically significant decreases in RBC counts (<3.3 x 1012/L) was similar in Plegridy -treated patients compared to placebo -treated patients. Hypersensitivity reactions Hypersensitivity events were reported in 16% of patients treated with Plegridy 125 micrograms every 2 weeks and 14% of patients who received placebo. Less than 1% of Plegridy treated patients experienced a serious hypersensitivity event (e.g. angioedema, urticaria) and they recovered promptly after treatment with anti-histamines and/or corticosteroids. Depression and suicidal ideation The overall incidence of adverse events related to depression and suicidal ideation was 8% for both Plegridy 125 micrograms every 2 weeks and placebo groups. The incidence of serious events related to depression and suicidal ideation were similar and low (<1%) in both Plegridy 125 micrograms every 2 weeks and placebo -treated patients. Seizure The incidence of seizure events was low and comparable in patients receiving Plegridy (125 micrograms every 2 weeks) and placebo (<1% in each group). Pulmonary arterial hypertension Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose In case of over-dose, patients may be hospitalized for observation and appropriate supportive treatment should be given. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 beta-1a conjugated with a single, linear molecule of 20,000 Da methoxy poly(ethyleneglycol) -O-2-methylpropionaldehyde (20 kDa mPEG -O-2-methylpropionaldehyde) at a degree of substitution of 1 mole of polymer/mole of protein. The average molecular mass is approximately 44 kDa of which the protein moiety constitutes approximately 23 kDa. Mechanism of action A definitive mechanism of action of peginterferon beta-1a in multiple sclerosis (MS) is not known. Plegridy binds to the type I interferon receptor on the surface of cells and elicits a cascade of intracellular events leading to the regulation of interferon -responsive gene expression. Biological effects that may be mediated by Plegridy include up-regulation of IL-2, IL-12, IFN-, TNF-) and inhibiting the migration of activated T cells across the blood brain barrier; however additional mechanisms may be involved. Whether the mechanism of action of Plegridy in MS is mediated by the same pathway(s) as the biological effects described above is not known because the pathophysiology of MS is only partially understood. Pharmacodynamic effects Plegridy is interferon beta-1a conjugated to a single, linear 20 kDa methoxy poly(ethyleneglycol) molecule at the alpha -amino group of the N-terminal amino acid residue. Interferons are a family of naturally occurring proteins that are induced by cells in response to biological and chemical stimuli, and mediate numerous cellular responses that have been classified as antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory in nature. The pharmacological properties of Plegridy are consistent with those of interferon beta-1a and are believed to be mediated by the protein portion of the molecule. Pharmacodynamic responses were evaluated by measuring the induction of interferon -responsive genes including those encoding 2,5-oligoadenylate synthetase (2,5-OAS), myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA), and cytokines, as well as neopterin (D-erythro - 1, 2, 3,- trihydroxypropylpterin), a product of the interferon -inducible enzyme, GTP-cyclohydrolase I. Gene induction in healthy human subjects was greater in terms of peak level and exposure (area under the effect curve) for Plegridy compared to non-pegylated interferon beta-1a (IM) when both were given at the same dose by activity (6 MIU). The duration of this response was sustained and prolonged for Plegridy, with elevations detected up to 15 days compared to 4 days for non-pegylated interferon beta-1a. Increased concentrations of neopterin were observed in both healthy subjects and multiple sclerosis patients treated with Plegridy, with a sustained and prolonged elevation over 10 days compared to 5 days observed for non-pegylated interferon beta-1a. Neopterin concentrations return to baseline after the two week dosing interval. Clinical efficacy and safety The efficacy and safety of Plegridy was assessed from the placebo -controlled first year of a 2 year randomised, double -blind, clinical study in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (the ADVANCE study). 1512 patients were randomised to and dosed with 125 micrograms Plegridy injected subcutaneously every 2 (n=512) or 4 (n=500) weeks versus placebo (n=500). The primary endpoint was the annualised relapse rate (ARR) over 1 year. The study design and patient demographics are presented in Table 2. No data are available from clinical efficacy/safety studies directly comparing pegylated with non- pegylated interferon beta-1a, or from patients switching between non-pegylated and pegylated interferon.

Plegridy also significantly reduced the risk of relapse by 39% (p=0.0003), the risk of sustained disability progression confirmed at 12 weeks by 38% (p=0.0383) and at 24 weeks (post -hoc analysis) by 54% (p=0.0069), the number of new the the number of new T1 hypointense lesions compared to placebo by 53% (p<0.0001). A treatment effect was observed as early as 6 months, with Plegridy 125 micrograms every 2 weeks demonstrating a 61% reduction (p<0.0001) in new or newly enlarging T2 lesions as compared with placebo. Across relapse and MRI endpoints Plegridy 125 micrograms every two weeks showed a numerically greater treatment effect over the Plegridy every four weeks dosing regimen at year 1. Results over 2 years confirmed that efficacy was maintained beyond the placebo controlled first year of the study. Patients exposed to Plegridy every 2 weeks showed statistically significant reductions compared to patients exposed to Plegridy every 4 weeks over 2 years in a post-hoc analysis for endpoints including ARR (24%, p=0.0209), the risk of relapse (24%, p=0.0212), the risk of disability progression with 24 p=0.0459), and p<0.0001 for all).

Subgroups of patients with higher disease activity were defined by relapse and MRI criteria as reported below, with the following efficacy results: - For patients with 1 relapse in the previous year and 9 T2 lesions or 1 Gd+ lesion (n=1401), the annual relapse rate at 1 year was 0.39 for placebo, 0.29 for Plegridy every 4 weeks and 0.25 for Plegridy every 2 weeks. Results in this subgroup were consistent with those in the overall population. - For patients with 2 relapses in the previous year and at least 1 Gd+ lesion (n=273), the annual relapse rate at 1 year was 0.47 for placebo, 0.35 for Plegridy every 4 weeks, and 0.33 for Plegridy every 2 weeks. Results in this subgroup were numerically consistent with those in the overall population but not statistically significant. Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Plegridy in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties The serum half-life of is Serum concentration of peginterferon beta-1a was dose -proportional in the range of 63 to 188 micrograms as observed in a single dose and a multiple dose study in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetics observed in multiple sclerosis patients were consistent with those seen in healthy subjects. Absorption Following subcutaneous administration of peginterferon beta-1a in multiple sclerosis patients, the peak concentration was reached between 1 to 1.5 days post-dose. The observed Cmax (mean\u00b1SE) was 280 \u00b1 79 pg/mL following repeat 125 micrograms every two weeks. Subcutaneous peginterferon beta-1a resulted in approximately 4-, 9-, and 13-fold higher exposure (AUC 168h ) values and approximately 2-, 3.5- and 5-fold higher Cmax, following single doses of 63 (6 MIU), 125 (12 MIU), and 188 (18 MIU) micrograms respectively, compared to intramuscular administration of 30 (6 MIU) micrograms non-pegylated beta-1a. Distribution Following repeat dosing of 125 micrograms doses every two weeks by subcutaneous administration, the volume of distribution uncorrected for bioavailability (mean\u00b1SE) 481 Roche Ltd 170/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Urinary (renal) clearance is postulated to be a major excretory pathway for Plegridy. The process of covalently conjugating a PEG moiety to a protein can alter the in vivo properties of the unmodified protein, including decreased renal clearance and decreased proteolysis thus extending the circulating half-life. Accordingly, the half-life (t1/2) of peginterferon beta-1a is approximately 2-fold longer than non-pegylated interferon beta -1a in healthy volunteers. In multiple sclerosis patients, the t1/2 (mean\u00b1SE) of peginterferon beta-1a was 78 \u00b1 15 hours at steady state. The mean steady state clearance of peginterferon beta-1a was 4.1 \u00b1 0.4 L/hr. Special populations Renal impairment A single -dose study in healthy subjects and subjects with various degrees of renal impairment (mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment as well as subjects with end state renal disease) showed a fractional increase in AUC (13-62%) and Cmax (42-71%) in subjects with mild (estimated glomerular filtration rate 50 to 80 mL/min/1.73m2), moderate (estimated glomerular filtration rate 30 to 50 mL/min/1.73m2), and severe (estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min/1.73m2) renal impairment, compared to subjects with normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate >80 mL/min/1.73m2). Subjects with end stage renal disease requiring 2-3 times haemodialysis weekly showed similar AUC and Cmax as compared to subjects with normal renal function. Each haemodialysis reduced peginterferon beta-1a concentration by approximately 24%, suggesting that haemodialysis partially removes peginterferon beta-1a from systemic circulation. Hepatic function The pharmacokinetics of peginterferon beta-1a has not been evaluated in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Elderly patients Clinical experience in patients aged above 65 years is limited. However, results from a population pharmacokinetic analysis (in patients up to 65 years) suggest that age does not impact peginterferon beta- 1a clearance. Gender No gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of peginterferon beta-1a was found in a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Race Race had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of peginterferon beta-1a in a population pharmacokinetic analysis. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Toxicity Following repeated subcutaneous administration of peginterferon beta-1a in rhesus monkeys at doses up to 400-fold (based on exposure, AUC) the recommended therapeutic dose; no effects other than the known mild pharmacological responses by rhesus monkeys to interferon beta-1a were observed after the first and second weekly dose. Repeated dose toxicology studies were limited to 5 weeks as exposure was greatly diminished from 3 weeks onwards, due to the formation of anti-drug antibodies by rhesus monkeys to human interferon beta-1a. Therefore, the long-term safety of chronic administration of Plegridy to patients cannot be assessed on the basis of these studies. Mutagenesis Peginterferon beta-1a was not mutagenic when tested in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) test and was not clastogenic in an in vitro assay in human Peginterferon beta-1a has not been tested for carcinogenicity in animals. Based on the known pharmacology of interferon beta-1a and clinical experience with interferon beta, the potential for carcinogenicity is expected to be low. Reproductive Toxicity Peginterferon beta-1a has not been tested for reproductive toxicity in pregnant animals. Fertility and developmental studies in rhesus monkeys have been carried out with non-pegylated interferon beta-1a. At very high doses, anovulatory and abortifacient effects were observed in animals. No information is available on the potential effects of peginterferon beta-1a on male fertility. Upon repeated dosing with peginterferon beta-1a of sexually mature female monkeys, effects on menstrual cycle length and progesterone levels were observed. Reversibility of the effects on menstrual cycle length was demonstrated. The validity of extrapolating these non-clinical data to humans is unknown. Data from studies with other interferon beta compounds did not show teratogenic potential. The available information on the effects of interferon beta-1a in the peri- and postnatal periods is limited. 6.

DATE OF REVISION OF THE TEXT Detailed information on this medicinal product is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency http://www.ema.europa.eu. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 173/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 SmPC for Rebif 1. NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Rebif 22 micrograms solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Each pre-filled syringe (0.5 mL) contains 22 micrograms (6 MIU*) of interferon beta-1a**. * Million International Units, measured by cytopathic effect (CPE) bioassay against the in -house interferon beta-1a standard which is calibrated against the current international NIH standard (GB- 23-902-531). ** produced in Chinese hamster ovary Cells (CHO -K1) by recombinant DNA technology. Excipient with known effect: 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol For the full list of excipi ents, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution for injection in pre -filled syringe. Clear to opalescent solution, with pH 3.5 to 4.5 and osmolarity 250 to 450 mOsm/L. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Rebif is indicated for the treatment of relapsing multiple sclerosis. In clinical trials, this was characterised by two or more acute exacerbations in the previous two years (see section 5.1). Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with secondary progressive multiple s clerosis without ongoing relapse activity (see section 5.1). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the disease. Rebif is available in three strengths: 8.8 micrograms, 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms. For patients initiating treatment with Rebif, Rebif 8.8 micrograms and Rebif 22 micrograms are available in a pack that corresponds to the patient needs for the first month of therapy. Posology The recommende d posology of Rebif is 44 micrograms given three times per week by subcutaneous injection. A lower dose of 22 micrograms, also given three times per week by subcutaneous injection, is recommended for patients who cannot tolerate the higher dose in view of the treating specialist. When first starting treatment with Rebif, the dose should be gradually escalated in order to allow tachyphylaxis to develop thus reducing adverse reactions. The Rebif initiation package corresponds to the patient needs for the fir st month of treatment. Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. However, a paediatric retrospective cohort study collected safety data with Rebif from medical records in children (n=52) and adolescents (n=255). The results of this study suggest that the safety profile in children (2 to 11 years old) and in adolescents (12 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms subcutaneous three times per week i s similar to that seen in adults. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 174/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 The safety and efficacy of Rebif in children below 2 years of age have not yet been established. Rebif should not be used in this age group. Method of administration Rebif is administered by subcutaneous injection. Prior to injection and for an additional 24 hours after each injection, an antipyretic analgesic is advised to decrease flu-like symptoms associated with Rebif administration. At the present time, it is not known for how long patients should be treated. S afety and efficacy with Rebif have not been demonstrated beyond 4 years of treatment. It is recommended that patients should be evaluated at least every second year in the 4-year period after initiation of treatment with Rebif and a decision for longer term treatment should then be made on an individual basis by the treating physician. 4.3 Contraindications Initiation of treatment in pregnancy (see section 4.6). Hypersensitivity to natural or recombinant interferon beta or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Current severe depression and/or suicidal ideation (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Patients should be informed of the most frequent adverse reactions associated with interferon beta administration, including symptoms of the flu-like syndrome (see section 4.8). These symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency and severity with continued treatment. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) Cases of thrombotic purpura (TTP) or haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), including fatal cases, have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur several weeks to several years after starting treatment with interferon beta. Early clinical features include thrombocytopenia, new onset hypertension , fever, central nervous syste m symptoms (e.g. confusion, paresis) and impaired renal function. Laboratory findings suggestive of TMA include decreased platelet counts, increased (LDH) due to haemolysis and schistocytes (erythrocyte fragmentation) on a blood film. Therefore if clinical features of TMA are observed, further testing of blood platelet levels, serum LDH, blood films and renal function is recommended. If TMA is diagnosed, prompt treatment is required (considering plasma exchange) and immediate discontinuation of Rebif is recommended. Depression and suicidal ideation Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with previous or current depressive disorders in particular to those with antecedents of suicidal ideation (see section 4.3). Depression and suicidal ideation are known to occur in increased frequency in the multiple sclerosis population and in association with interferon use. Patients treated with Rebif should be advised to immediately report any symptoms of depression and/or suicidal ideation to their prescribing physician. Patients exhibiting depression should be monitored closely during therapy with Rebif and treated appropriately. Cessation of therapy with Rebif should be considered (see sections 4.3 and 4.8). Seizure disorders Rebif should be administered with caution to patients with a history of seizures, to those receiving treatment with anti-epileptics, particularly if their epilepsy is not adequately controlled with antiepileptics (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). Cardiac disease Patients with cardiac disease, such as angina, congestive heart failure or arrhythmia, should be closely monitored for worsening of their clinical condition during initiation of therapy with interferon beta-1a. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 175/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Symptoms of the flu-like syndrome associated with interferon beta-1a therapy may prove stressful to patients with cardiac conditions. Injection site necrosis Injection site necrosis (ISN) has been reported in patients using Rebif (see section 4.8). To minimise the risk of injection site necrosis patients should be advised to: use an aseptic injection technique, rotate the injection sites with each dose. The procedure for the self-administration by the patient should be reviewed periodically especial ly if injection site reactions have occurred. If the patient experiences any break in the skin, which may be associated with swelling or drainage of fluid from the injection site, the patient should be advised to consult with their physician before continuing injections with Rebif. If the patient has multiple lesions, Rebif should be discontinued until healing has occurred. Patients with single lesions may continue provided that the necrosis is not too extensive. Hepatic dysfunction In clinical trials with Rebif, asympt omatic elevations of hepatic transaminases (particularly alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) were common and 1-3% of patients developed elevations of hepatic transaminases above 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). In the absence of clinical symptoms, serum ALT levels should be monitored prior to the start of therapy, at months 1, 3 and 6 on therapy and periodically thereafter. Dose reduction of Rebif should be considered if ALT rises above 5 times the ULN, and gradually re-escalated when enzyme levels have normalized. Rebif should be initiated with caution in patients with a history of significant liver disease, clinical evidence of active liver disease, alcohol abuse or increased serum ALT (>2.5 times ULN). Treatment with Rebif shou ld be stopped if icterus or other clinical symptoms of liver dysfunction appear. Rebif, like other interferons beta, has a potential for causing severe liver injury including acute hepatic failure (see section 4.8). The majority of the cases of severe liv er injury occurred within the first six months of treatment. The mechanism for the rare symptomatic hepatic dysfunction is not known. No specific risk factors have been identified. Renal and urinary disorders Nephrotic syndrome Cases of nephrotic syndrome with different underlying nephropathies including collapsing focal glomerulopathy (MGN) have been reported during treatment with interferon - beta products. Events were reported at various time points during treatment and may occur after several years of treatment with interferon -beta. Periodic monitoring of early signs or symptoms, e.g. oedema, proteinuria and impaired renal function is recommended, especially in patients at higher risk of renal disease. Prompt treatment of nephrotic syndrome is required and discontinuation of treatment with Rebif should be considered. Laboratory abnormalities Laboratory abnormalities are associated with the use of interferons. Therefore, in addition to those laboratory tests normally required for monitoring patients with multiple sclerosis, liver enzyme monitoring and complete and differential blood cell counts and platel et counts are recommended at regular intervals (1, 3 and 6 months) following introduction of Rebif therapy and then periodically thereafter in the absence of clinical symptoms. Thyroid disorders Patients being treated with Rebif may occasionally develop new or worsening thyroid abnormalities. Thyroid function testing is recommended at baseline and if abnormal, every 6-12 months following initiation of therapy. If tests are normal at baseline, routine testing is not needed but should be performed if clinical findings of thyroid dysfunction appear (see section 4.8). Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 176/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Severe renal or hepatic failure and severe myelosuppression Caution should be used, and close monitoring considered when administering interferon beta -1a to patients with severe renal and hepatic failure and to patients with severe myelosuppression. Neutralising antibodies Serum neutralising antibodies against interferon beta-1a may develop. The precise incidence of antibodies is as yet uncertain. Clinical data suggest that after 24 to 48 months of treatment with Rebif 22 micrograms, approximately 24% of patients develop persistent serum antibodies to interferon beta-1a. The presence of antibodies has been shown to attenuate the pharmacodynamic response to interferon beta -1a (beta -2 microglobulin and neopterin). Although the clinical significance of the induction of antibodies has not been fully elucidated, the development of neutralising antibodies is associated with reduced efficacy on clinical and MRI variables. If a patient respon ds poorly to therapy with Rebif, and has neutralising antibodies, the treating physician should reassess the benefit/risk ratio of continued Rebif therapy. The use of various assays to detect serum antibodies and differing definitions of antibody positivi ty limits the ability to compare antigenicity among different products. Other forms of multiple sclerosis Only sparse safety and efficacy data are available from non-ambulatory patients with multiple sclerosis. Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis and should not be used in these patients. Benzyl alcohol This medicinal product contains 2.5 mg benzyl alcohol per dose. It must not be given to premature babies or neonates. It may cause toxic reactions and anaphylactoid reactions in infants and children up to 3 years old. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have be en performed with interferon beta-1a in humans. Interferons have been reported to reduce the activity of hepatic cytochrome P450 -dependent enzymes in humans and animals. Caution should be exercised when administering Rebif in combination with medicinal products that have a narrow therapeutic index and are largely dependent on the hepatic cytochrome P450 system for clearance, e.g. antiepileptics and s ome classes of antidepressants. The interaction of Rebif with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) has not been studied systematically. Clinical studies indicate that multiple sclerosis patients can receive Rebif and corticosteroids or AC TH during relapses. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Women of child-bearing potential Women of child-bearing potential should take appropriate contraceptive measures. If the patient becomes pregnant or plans to become pregnant while taking Rebif she should be informed of the potential hazards and discontinuation of therapy should be considered (see section 5.3). In patients with a high relapse rate before treatment has started, the risk of a severe relapse following discontinuation of Rebif in the event of pregnancy should be weighed against a possible increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Pregnancy There is limited information on the use of Rebif in pregnancy. Available data indicates that there may be an increased risk of spontaneous abortion . Therefore initiation of treatment is contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). Breast -feeding Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 177/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 It is not known whether Rebif is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast -fed infants, a decision should be made whether to discontinue breast -feeding or Rebif therapy. Fertility The effects of Rebif on fertility have not been investigated. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines Central nervous system -related adverse events asso ciated with the use of interferon beta (e.g. dizziness) might influence the patient's ability to drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The highest incidence of adverse reactions associated with Rebif therapy is related to flu-like syndrome. Flu-like symptoms tend to be most prominent at the initiation of therapy and decrease in frequency with continued treatment. Approximately 70% of pati ents treated with Rebif can expect to experience the typical interferon flu-like syndrome within the first six months after starting treatment. Approximately 30% of patients will also experience reactions at the injection site, predominantly mild inflammat ion or erythema. Asymptomatic increases in laboratory parameters of hepatic function and decreases in white blood cells are also common. The majority of adverse reactions observed with interferon beta-1a are usually mild and reversible, and respond well to dose reductions. In case of severe or persistent undesirable effects, the dose of Rebif may be temporarily lowered or interrupted, at the discretion of the physician. List of adverse reactions The adverse reactions presented have been identified from clinical studies as well as from post - marketing reports (an asterisk [*] indicates adverse reactions identified during post -marketing surveillance) . The following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used hereafter: very common (1/10), common ( to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Blood and the lymphatic system beta products, see section 4.4), pancytopenia* Endocrine disorders Uncommon: Thyroid dysfunction, most often presenting as hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism Immune system disorders Rare: or icterus* Rare: (see section 4.4), autoimmune insomnia Rare: Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 178/Protocol Nervous system disorders Very common: Headache Uncommon: Seizures* Frequency not known: Transient neurological symptoms (i.e. hypoesthesia, muscle spasm, paraesthesia, difficulty in walking, musculoskeletal stiffness) that may mimic multiple sclerosis exacerbations* Eye disorders Uncommon: Retinal vascular disorders (i.e. retinop athy, cotton wool spots, obstruction of retinal artery or Vascular disorders Pulmonary arterial hypertension* (class label for interferon beta products, see below Pulmonary arterial hypertension) Gastrointestinal disorders Common: Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea Skin syndrome*, glomerulosclerosis* (see section 4.4) General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: Injection site inflammation, injection site reaction, influenza -like symptoms Common: Injection site pain, fatigue, rigors, fever Uncommon: Injection site necrosis, injection site mass, injection site abscess, injection site infections*, increased sweating* Rare: Injection site cellulitis* Paediatric population No formal clinical trials or pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted in children or adolescents. Limited safety data suggest that the safety profile in children and adolescents (2 to 17 years old) receiving Rebif 22 micrograms or 44 micrograms three times weekly is similar to that seen in adults. Class effects The administration of interferons has been associated with anorexia, dizziness, anxiety, arrhythmias, vasodilation and palpitation, menorrhagia and metrorrhagia. An increased formation of auto-antibodies may occur during tr eatment with interferon beta. Pulmonary arterial hypertension Cases of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have been reported with interferon beta products. Events were reported at various time points including up to several years after starting treatmen t with interferon beta. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 179/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 In case of overdose, patients should be hospitalised for observation and appropriate supportive treatment sh ould be given. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES immunomodulatory, antiviral and antiproliferative properties. Rebif (interferon beta-1a) shares the same amino acid sequence with endogenous human interferon beta. It is produced in mammalian cells (Chinese hamster ovary) and is therefore glycosylated like the natural protein. Regardless of the route of dosing, pronounced pharmacodynamic changes are associated with the administration of Rebif. After a single dose, intracellular and serum activity of synthetase and serum concentrations of beta-2 microglobulin and neopteri n increase within 24 hours, and start to decline within 2 days. Intramuscular and subcutaneous administrations produce fully superimposable responses. After repeated subcutaneous administration every 48 hours for 4 doses, these biological responses remain elevated, with no signs of tolerance development. Biological response markers (e.g., 2',5'-OAS activity, neopterin and beta 2 -microglobulin) are induced by interferon beta-1a following subcutaneous doses administered to healthy volunteer subjects. Time to peak concentrations following a single subcutaneous injection were 24 to 48 hours for neopterin, beta-2- microglobulin and 2'5'OAS, 12 hours for MX1 and 24 hours for OAS1 and OAS2 gene expression. Peaks of similar height and time were observed for most of these markers after first and sixth administration. The precise mechanism of action of Rebif in multiple sclerosis is still under investigation. Relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis The safety and efficacy of Rebif has been evaluated in patients with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis at doses ranging from 11 to 44 micrograms (3-12 million IU), administered subcutaneously three times per week. At licensed posology, Rebif 22 micrograms has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence (approximately 30% over 2 years) and severity of clinical relapses in patients with at least 2 exacerbations in the previous 2 years and with an EDSS of 0-5.0 at entry. The proportion of patients with disability progression, as defined by at least one point increase in E DSS confirmed three months later, was reduced from 39% (placebo) to 30% (Rebif 22 micrograms). Over 4 years, the reduction in the mean exacerbation rate was 22% in patients treated with Rebif 22 micrograms, and 29% in patients treated with Rebif 44 microgr ams group compared with a group of patients treated with placebo for 2 years and then either Rebif 22 or Rebif 44 micrograms for 2 years. Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis In a 3-year study in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (EDSS 3-6.5) with evidence of clinical progression in the preceding two years and who had not experienced relapses in the preceding 8 weeks, Rebif had no significant effect on progression of disability, but relapse rate was reduced by approximately 30%. I f the patient population was divided into 2 subgroups (those with and those without relapses in the 2 -year period prior to study entry), there was no effect on disability in patients without relapses, but in patients with relapses, the proportion with prog ression in disability at the end of the study was reduced from 70% (placebo) to 57% (Rebif 22 micrograms and 44 micrograms combined). These results obtained in a subgroup of patients a posteriori should be interpreted cautiously. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis Rebif has not yet been investigated in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis, and should not be used in these patients. 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 180/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Absorption In healthy volunteers after intravenous administration, interferon beta-1a exhibits a sharp multi-exponential decline, with serum levels proportional to the dose. Subcutaneous and intramuscular administrations of Rebif produce equivalent exposure to interferon beta. Distribution Following repeated subcutaneous injections of 22 and 44 micrograms doses of Rebif maximum concentrations were typically observed after 8 hours, but this was highly variable. Elimination After repeated subcutaneous doses in healthy volunteers, the main PK parameters (AUC tau and Cmax) increased proportional to the increased in dose from 22 micrograms to 44 micrograms. The estimated apparent half-life is 50 to 60 hours, which is in line with the accumulation observed after multiple dosing. Metabolism Interferon beta-1a is mainly metabolised and excreted by the liver and the kidneys. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated -dose toxicity, and genotoxicity. Rebif has not been investigated for carcinogenicity. A study on embryo/foetal toxicity in monkeys showed no evidence of reproductive disturbances. Based on observations with other alpha and beta interferons, an i ncreased risk of abortions cannot be excluded. No information is available on the effects of the interferon beta-1a on male fertility. 6.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT Tecfidera 120 mg gastro -resistant hard capsules Tecfidera 240 mg gastro -resistant hard capsules 2. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION Tecfidera 120mg capsule Each capsule contains 120 mg dimethyl fumarate. Tecfidera 240mg capsule Each capsule contains 240 mg dimethyl fumarate For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Gastro -resistant hard capsule Tecfidera 120mg capsule Green and white hard capsule 'BG-12 120 mg'. Tecfidera capsule Green gastro -resistant hard capsule printed with 'BG-12 240 mg' 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Tecfidera is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (please refer to section 5.1 for important information on the populations for which efficacy has been established). 4.2 Posology and method of administration Treatment should be initiated under supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of the disease. Posology The starting dose is 120 mg twice a day. After 7 days, the dose is increased to the recommended dose of 240 mg twice a day. Temporary dose reduction to 120 mg twice a day may reduce the occurrence of flushing and gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Within 1 month, the recommended dose of 240 mg twice a day should be resumed. Tecfidera should be taken with food (see section 5.2). For those patients who may experience flushing or gastrointestinal adverse reactions, taking Tecfidera with food may improve tolerability (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 4.8). Elderly Clinical studies of Tecfidera had limited exposure to patients aged 55 years and above, and did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger patients (see section 5.2). Based on the mode of action of the active substance there are no theoretical reasons for any requirement for dose adjustments in the elderly. Renal and hepatic impairment Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 183/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Tecfidera has not been studied in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Based on clinical pharmacology studies, no dose adjustments are needed (see section 5.2). Caution should be used when treating patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4). Paediatric population The safety and efficacy of Tecfidera in children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 years have not been established. No data are available. There is no relevant use of Tecfidera in children aged less than 10 years for the indication of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. Method of administration For oral use. The capsule or its contents should not be crushed, divided, dissolved, sucked or chewed as the enteric - coating of the microtablets prevents irritant effects on the gut. 4.3 Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Blood/laboratory tests Changes in renal and hepatic laboratory tests have been seen in clinical trials in subjects treated with Tecfidera (see section 4.8). The clinical implications of these changes are unknown. Assessments of renal function (e.g. creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and urinalysis) and hepatic function (e.g. ALT and AST) are recommended prior to treatment initiation, after 3 and 6 months of treatment, every 6 to 12 months thereafter and as clinically indicated. Patients treated with Tecfidera may develop severe prolonged lymphopaenia (see section 4.8). Tecfidera has not been studied in patients with pre-existing low lymphocyte counts and caution should be exercised when treating these patients. Prior to initiating treatment with Tecfidera, a current complete blood count, including lymphocytes, must be performed. If lymphocyte count is found to be below the normal range, thorough assessment of possible causes should be completed prior to initiation of treatment with Tecfidera. After starting therapy, complete blood counts, including lymphocytes, must be performed every 3 months. Consider interruption of Tecfidera in patients with lymphocyte counts <0.5x109/L persisting for more than 6 months. The benefit/risk balance of the therapy should be reconsidered in discussion with the patient in the context of other therapeutic options available. Clinical factors, evaluation of any laboratory and imaging investigations could be included as part of this re-consideration. If treatment is continued despite a persistent lymphocyte count < 0.5x109/L, enhanced vigilance is recommended (see also subsection on PML). Lymphocyte counts should be followed until recovery. Upon recovery and in the absence of alternative treatment options, decisions about whether or not to restart Tecfidera after treatment discontinuation should be based on clinical judgement. MR imaging Before initiating treatment with Tecfidera, a baseline MRI should be available (usually within 3 months) as a reference. The need for further MRI scanning should be considered in accordance with national and local recommendations. MRI imaging may be considered as part of increased vigilance in patients considered at increased risk of PML. In case of clinical suspicion of PML, MRI should be performed immediately for diagnostic purposes. Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) PML cases have occurred with Tecfidera and other products containing fumarates in the setting of severe and prolonged lymphopenia. PML is an opportunistic infection caused by John -Cunningham virus (JCV), which may be fatal or result in severe disability. PML can only occur in the presence of a JCV infection. If Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 184/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 JCV testing is undertaken, it should be considered that the influence of lymphopenia on the accuracy of anti-JCV antibody test has not been studied in Tecfidera treated patients. It should also be noted that a negative anti JCV antibody test (in the presence of normal lymphocyte counts) does not preclude the possibility of subsequent JCV infection. Prior treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulating therapies No studies have been performed evaluating the efficacy and safety of Tecfidera when switching patients from other disease modifying therapies to Tecfidera. The contribution of prior immunosuppressive therapy to the development of PML in Tecfidera treated patients is unknown. When switching patients from another disease modifying therapy to Tecfidera, the half-life and mode of action of the other therapy should be considered in order to avoid an additive immune effect while at the same time, reducing the risk of reactivation of MS. A complete blood count is recommended prior to initiating Tecfidera and regularly during treatment (see Blood/laboratory tests above). Tecfidera can generally be started immediately after discontinuation of interferon or glatiramer acetate. Severe renal and hepatic impairment Tecfidera has not been studied in patients with severe renal or severe hepatic impairment and caution should, therefore, be used in these patients (see section 4.2). Severe active gastrointestinal disease Tecfidera has not been studied in patients with severe active gastrointestinal disease and caution should, therefore, be used in these patients. Flushing In clinical trials, 34% of Tecfidera treated patients experienced flushing. In the majority of patients who experienced flushing, it was mild or moderate in severity. In clinical trials, 3 patients out of a total of 2,560 patients treated with Tecfidera experienced serious flushing symptoms that were probable hypersensitivity or anaphylactoid reactions. These events were not life-threatening, but led to hospitalisation. Prescribers and patients should be alert to this possibility in the event of severe flushing reactions (see sections 4.2, 4.5 and 4.8). Infections In phase III placebo -controlled studies, the incidence of infections (60% vs 58%) and serious infections (2% vs 2%) was similar in patients treated with Tecfidera or placebo, respectively. There was no increased incidence of serious infections observed in patients with lymphocyte counts <0.8x109/L or <0.5x109/L. During treatment with Tecfidera in the MS placebo controlled trials, mean lymphocyte counts decreased by approximately 30% from baseline at one year and then plateaued (see section 4.8). Mean lymphocyte counts remained within normal limits. Patients with lymphocyte counts <0.5x109/L were observed in <1% of patients treated with placebo and 6% of patients treated with Tecfidera. In clinical studies (both controlled and uncontrolled), 2% of patients experienced lymphocyte counts <0.5 x 109/L for at least six months. In these patients, the majority of lymphocyte counts remained <0.5 x 109/L with continued therapy. If therapy is continued in the presence of severe prolonged lymphopenia, the risk of an opportunistic infection, including Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) cannot be ruled out (please refer to subsection PML above for further details). If a patient develops a serious infection, suspending treatment with Tecfidera should be considered and the benefits and risks should be reassessed prior to re-initiation of therapy. Patients receiving Tecfidera should be instructed to report symptoms of infections to a physician. Patients with serious infections should not start treatment with Tecfidera until the infection(s) is resolved. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 185/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Tecfidera has not been studied in combination with anti-neoplastic or immunosuppressive therapies and caution should, therefore, be used during concomitant administration. In multiple sclerosis clinical studies, the concomitant treatment of relapses with a short course of intravenous corticosteroids was not associated with a clinically relevant increase of infection. Vaccination during treatment with Tecfidera has not been studied. It is not known whether treatment with Tecfidera might reduce the effectiveness of some vaccines. Live vaccines might carry an increased risk of clinical infection and should not be given to patients treated with Tecfidera unless, in exceptional cases, this potential risk is considered to be outweighed by the risk to the individual of not vaccinating. During treatment with Tecfidera, simultaneous use of other fumaric acid derivatives (topical or systemic) should be avoided. In humans, dimethyl fumarate is extensively metabolised by esterases before it reaches the systemic circulation and further metabolism occurs through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, with no involvement of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Potential drug interaction risks were not identified from in vitro CYP- inhibition and induction studies, a p-glycoprotein study, or studies of the protein binding of dimethyl fumarate and monomethyl fumarate (a primary metabolite of dimethyl fumarate). Commonly used medicinal products in patients with multiple sclerosis, intramuscular interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate, were clinically tested for potential interactions with dimethyl fumarate and did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of dimethyl fumarate. Administration of 325 mg (or equivalent) non-enteric coated acetylsalicylic acid, 30 minutes prior to Tecfidera, over 4 days of dosing, did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of Tecfidera and reduced the occurrence and severity of flushing in a healthy volunteer study. However, long term use of acetylsalicylic acid is not recommended for the management of flushing. Potential risks associated with acetylsalicylic acid therapy should be considered prior to co-administration with Tecfidera. (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8). Concurrent therapy with nephrotoxic medicinal products (such as aminoglycosides, diuretics, NSAIDs or lithium) may increase the potential of renal adverse reactions (e.g. proteinuria) in patients taking Tecfidera (see section 4.8). Consumption of moderate amounts of alcohol did not alter exposure to Tecfidera and was not associated with an increase in adverse reactions. Consumption of large quantities of undiluted strong alcoholic drinks (more than 30% alcohol by volume) may lead to increased dissolution rates of Tecfidera and, therefore, may increase the frequency of gastrointestinal adverse reactions. In vitro CYP induction studies did not demonstrate an interaction between Tecfidera and oral contraceptives. In vivo interaction studies have not been performed with oral contraceptives. Even though an interaction is not expected, non -hormonal contraceptive measures should be considered with Tecfidera (see section 4.6). Paediatric population Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are no or limited amount of data from the use of dimethyl fumarate in pregnant women. Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Tecfidera is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using appropriate contraception (see section 4.5). Tecfidera should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed and if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. Breast -feeding Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 186/Protocol MA30005, Version It is unknown whether dimethyl fumarate or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast -feeding or to discontinue Tecfidera therapy. The benefit of breast -feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman should be taken into account. Fertility There are no data on the effects of Tecfidera on human fertility. Data from preclinical studies do not suggest that dimethyl fumarate would be associated with an increased risk of reduced fertility (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the ability to drive and use machines have been conducted. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile The most common adverse reactions (incidence 10%) for patients treated with Tecfidera were flushing and gastrointestinal events (i.e. diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper). Flushing and gastrointestinal events tend to begin early in the course of treatment (primarily during the first month) and in patients who experience flushing and gastrointestinal events, these events may continue to occur intermittently throughout treatment with Tecfidera. The most commonly reported adverse reactions leading to discontinuation (incidence >1%) in patients treated with Tecfidera were flushing (3%) and gastrointestinal events (4%). In placebo -controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies, a total of 2,468 patients have received Tecfidera and been followed for periods up to 4 years with an overall exposure equivalent to 3,588 person -years. Approximately 1,056 patients have received more than 2 years of treatment with Tecfidera. The experience in uncontrolled clinical trials is consistent with the experience in the placebo -controlled clinical trials. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions Adverse reactions, which were more frequently reported in Tecfidera versus placebo -treated patients, are presented in the table below. These data were derived from 2 pivotal Phase 3 placebo -controlled, double - blind clinical trials with a total of 1,529 patients treated with Tecfidera and for up to 24 months with an overall exposure of 2,371 person -years (see section 5.1). The frequencies described in the table below are based on 769 patients treated with Tecfidera 240 mg twice a day and 771 patients treated with placebo. The adverse reactions are presented as MedDRA preferred terms under the MedDRA System Organ Class. The incidence of the adverse reactions below are expressed according to the following categories: - Very common (1/10) - Common (1/100 to <1/10) - Uncommon (1/1, 000 to <1/100) - Rare (1/10, 000 to <1/1,000) - Very rare (<1/10,000) - Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) MedDRA System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequency category Infections and infestations Gastroenteritis Common Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) Not known Blood and lymphatic system disorders Lymphopenia Common Leucopenia Common Immune system disorders Hypersensitivity Uncommon Nervous system disorders Burning sensation Common Vascular disorders Flushing Very common Hot flush Common Ocrelizumab \u2014F.

Flushing is usually described as flushing or hot flush, but can include other events (e.g. warmth, redness, itching, and burning sensation). Flushing events tend to begin early in the course of treatment (primarily during the first month) and in patients who experience flushing, these events may continue to occur intermittently throughout treatment with Tecfidera. In patients with flushing, the majority had flushing events that were mild or moderate in severity. Overall, 3% of patients treated with Tecfidera discontinued due to flushing. The incidence of serious flushing, which may be characterised by generalised erythema, rash and/or pruritus, was seen in less than 1% of patients treated with Tecfidera (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.5). Gastrointestinal The incidence of gastrointestinal events (e.g. diarrhoea [14% versus 10%], nausea [12% versus upper versus abdominal pain [9% versus 4%], vomiting [8% versus 5%] and dyspepsia [5% versus 3%]) was increased in patients treated with Tecfidera compared to placebo, respectively. Gastrointestinal events tend to begin early in the course of treatment (primarily during the first month) and in patients who experience gastrointestinal events, these events may continue to occur intermittently throughout treatment with Tecfidera. In the majority of patients who experienced gastrointestinal events, it was mild or moderate in severity. Four per cent (4%) of patients treated with Tecfidera discontinued due to gastrointestinal events. The incidence of serious gastrointestinal events, including gastroenteritis and gastritis, was seen in 1% of patients treated with Tecfidera (see section 4.2). Hepatic transaminases In placebo -controlled studies, elevations of hepatic transaminases were observed. The majority of patients with elevations had hepatic transaminases that were <3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). The increased incidence of elevations of hepatic transaminases in patients treated with Tecfidera relative to placebo was primarily seen during the first 6 months of treatment. Elevations of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase 3 times ULN, respectively, were seen in 5% and 2% of patients treated with placebo and 6% and 2% of patients treated with Tecfidera. There were no elevations in transaminases 3 times ULN with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann due to elevated hepatic transaminases were <1% and similar in patients treated with Tecfidera or placebo. Renal In placebo -controlled studies, the incidence of proteinuria was higher in patients treated with Tecfidera (9%) compared to placebo (7%). The overall incidence of renal and urinary adverse events was similar for Tecfidera and placebo -treated patients. There were no reports of serious renal failure. On urinalysis, the percentage of patients with protein values of 1+ or greater was similar for Tecfidera (43%) and placebo -treated patients (40%). Typically, laboratory observations of proteinuria were not progressive. Compared to patients treated with placebo, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was observed to increase in patients treated with Tecfidera, including those patients with 2 consecutive occurrences of proteinuria (1+). Haematological In the placebo -controlled studies, most patients (>98%) had normal lymphocyte values prior to initiating treatment. Upon treatment with Tecfidera, mean lymphocyte counts decreased over the first year with a subsequent plateau. On average, lymphocyte counts decreased by approximately 30% of baseline value. Mean and median lymphocyte counts remained within normal limits. Lymphocyte counts <0.5x109/l were observed in <1% of patients treated with placebo and 6% of patients treated with Tecfidera. A lymphocyte count <0.2x109/l was observed in 1 patient treated with Tecfidera and in no patients treated with placebo.The incidence of infections (58% versus 60%) and serious infections (2% versus 2%) was similar in patients treated with placebo or Tecfidera. An increased incidence of infections and serious infections was not observed in patients with lymphocyte counts <0.8x109/l or <0.5x109/l. PML has occurred in the setting of severe and prolonged lymphopenia (please refer to section 4.4). A transient increase in mean eosinophil counts was seen during the first 2 months of therapy. Laboratory abnormalities In the placebo -controlled studies, measurement of urinary ketones (1+ or greater) was higher in patients treated with Tecfidera (45%) compared to placebo (10%). No untoward clinical consequences were observed in clinical trials. Levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D decreased in Tecfidera treated patients relative to placebo (median percentage decrease from baseline at 2 years of 25% versus 15%, respectively) and levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) increased in Tecfidera treated patients relative to placebo (median percentage increase from baseline at 2 years of 29% versus 15%, respectively). Mean values for both parameters remained within normal range. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 4.9 Overdose No cases of overdose have been reported. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, ATC code: N07XX09 Mechanism of action The mechanism by which dimethyl fumarate exerts therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis is not fully understood. Preclinical studies indicate that dimethyl fumarate pharmacodynamic responses appear to be primarily mediated through activation of the Nuclear factor (erythroid -derived 2)-like 5 pathway. Dimethyl fumarate has been shown to up regulate Nrf2-dependent patients (e.g. NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, quinone 1; [NQO1]). Pharmacodynamic effects Effects on the immune system In preclinical and clinical studies, Tecfidera demonstrated anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. metabolite of dimethyl fumarate, significantly reduced immune cell activation and subsequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to inflammatory stimuli in preclinical models. In clinical studies with psoriasis patients, dimethyl fumarate affected lymphocyte phenotypes through of inflammatory cytokine TH17), and biased towards anti-inflammatory production (TH2). Dimethyl fumarate demonstrated therapeutic activity in multiple models of inflammatory and neuroinflammatory injury. In Phase 3 studies, upon treatment with Tecfidera mean lymphocyte counts decreased on average by approximately 30% of their baseline value over the first year with a subsequent plateau. Effect on cardiovascular system Single doses of 240 mg or 360 mg Tecfidera did not have any effect on the QTc interval when compared to placebo in a QTc study. Clinical efficacy and safety Two, 2-year, randomised, double -blind, placebo controlled studies [Study 1 (DEFINE) with 1234 subjects and Study 2 (CONFIRM) with 1417 subjects] of subjects with relapsing -remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) were performed. Subjects with progressive forms of MS were not included in these studies. Efficacy (see table below) and safety were demonstrated in subjects with Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores ranging from 0 to 5 inclusive, who had experienced at least 1 relapse during the year prior to randomisation, or, within 6 weeks of randomisation had a brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) demonstrating at least one gadolinium -enhancing (Gd+) lesion. Study 2 contained a rater-blinded (i.e. study physician/ investigator assessing the response to study treatment was blinded) reference comparator of glatiramer acetate. In Study 1, patients had the following median baseline characteristics: age 39 years, disease duration 7.0 years, EDSS score 2.0. In addition, 16% of patients had an EDSS score >3.5, 28% had 2 relapses in the prior year and 42% had previously received other approved MS treatments. In the MRI cohort 36% of patients entering the study had Gd+ lesions at baseline (mean number of Gd+ lesions 1.4). In Study 2, patients had the following median baseline characteristics: age 37 years, disease duration 6.0 years, EDSS score 2.5. In addition, 17% of patients had an EDSS score >3.5, 32% had 2 relapses in the prior year and 30% had previously received other approved MS treatments. In the MRI cohort 45% of patients entering the study had Gd+ lesions at baseline (mean number of Gd+ lesions 2.4). Compared to placebo, subjects treated with Tecfidera had a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction on: the primary endpoint in Study 1, proportion of subjects relapsed at 2 years; and the primary endpoint in Study 2, annualised relapse rate at 2 years. The annualised relapse rate for glatiramer acetate and placebo was 0.286 and 0.401 respectively in Study 2, corresponding to a reduction of 29% (p=0.013), which is consistent with approved prescribing information.

Due to the design of the studies, high disease activity was defined as follows: - Patients with 2 or more relapses in one year, and with one or more Gd-enhancing lesions on brain MRI (n=42 in DEFINE; n=51 in CONFIRM) or, - Patients who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course (at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon, having had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial MRI or at least 1 Gd-enhancing lesion, or patients having an unchanged or increased relapse rate in the prior year as compared to the previous 2 years (n=177 in DEFINE; n=141 in CONFIRM). Paediatric population The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Tecfidera in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La fumarate) undergoes rapid presystemic hydrolysis by converted to its primary metabolite, monomethyl fumarate, which is also active. Dimethyl fumarate is not quantifiable in plasma following oral administration of Tecfidera. Therefore, all pharmacokinetic analyses related to dimethyl fumarate were performed with plasma monomethyl fumarate concentrations. Pharmacokinetic data were obtained in subjects with multiple sclerosis and healthy volunteers. Absorption The Tmax of monomethyl fumarate is 2 to 2.5 hours. As Tecfidera gastro -resistant hard capsules contain microtablets, which are protected by an enteric coating, absorption does not commence until they leave the stomach (generally less than 1 hour). Following 240 mg twice a day administered with food, the median peak (Cmax) was 1.72 mg/l and overall (AUC) exposure was 8.02 h.mg/l in subjects with multiple sclerosis. Overall, Cmax and AUC increased approximately dose - proportionally in the dose range studied (120 mg to 360 mg). In subjects with multiple sclerosis, two 240 mg doses were administered 4 hours apart as part of a three times a day dosing regimen. This resulted in a minimal accumulation of exposure yielding an increase in the median Cmax of 12% compared to the twice daily dosing (1.72 mg/l for twice daily compared to 1.93 mg/l for three times daily) with no safety implications. Food does not have a clinically significant effect on exposure of dimethyl fumarate. However, Tecfidera should be taken with food due to improved tolerability with respect to flushing or gastrointestinal adverse events (see section 4.2). Distribution The apparent volume of distribution following oral administration of 240 mg Tecfidera varies between 60 L and 90 L. Human plasma protein binding of monomethyl fumarate generally ranges between 27% and 40%. Biotransformation In dimethyl fumarate is extensively metabolised with less than 0.1% of the dose excreted as unchanged dimethyl fumarate in urine. It is initially metabolised by esterases, which are ubiquitous in the gastrointestinal tract, blood and tissues, before it reaches the systemic circulation. Further metabolism occurs through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, with no involvement of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. A single 240 mg 14C-dimethyl fumarate dose study identified glucose as the predominant metabolite in human plasma. Other circulating metabolites included fumaric acid, citric acid and monomethyl fumarate. The downstream metabolism of fumaric acid occurs through the tricarboxylic acid cycle, with exhalation of CO2 serving as a primary route of elimination. Elimination Exhalation of CO2 is the primary route of dimethyl fumarate elimination accounting for 60% of the dose. Renal and faecal elimination are secondary routes of elimination, accounting for 15.5% and 0.9% of the dose respectively. The terminal half-life of monomethyl fumarate is short (approximately 1 hour) and no circulating monomethyl fumarate is present at 24 hours in the majority of individuals. Accumulation of parent drug or monomethyl fumarate does not occur with multiple doses of dimethyl fumarate at the therapeutic regimen. Linearity Dimethyl fumarate exposure increases in an approximately dose proportional manner with single and multiple doses in the 120 mg to 360 mg dose range studied. Pharmacokinetics in special patient groups Based on the results of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), body weight is the main covariate of exposure (by Cmax and AUC) in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) subjects, but did not affect safety and efficacy measures evaluated in the clinical studies. Gender and age did not have a clinically significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of dimethyl fumarate. The pharmacokinetics in patients aged 65 and over has not been studied. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 192/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Paediatric population The pharmacokinetics in patients below the age of 18 has not been studied. Renal impairment Since the renal pathway is a secondary route of elimination for dimethyl fumarate accounting for less than 16% of the dose administered, evaluation of pharmacokinetics in individuals with renal impairment was not conducted. Hepatic impairment As dimethyl fumarate and monomethyl fumarate are metabolised by esterases, without the involvement of the CYP450 system, evaluation of phamacokinetics in individuals with hepatic impairment was not conducted. 5.3 Preclinical safety data The adverse reactions described in the Toxicology and Reproduction toxicity sections below were not observed in clinical studies, but were seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels. Mutagenesis Dimethyl fumarate and mono -methylfumarate were negative in a battery of in vitro assays (Ames, chromosomal aberration in mammalian cells). Dimethyl fumarate was negative in the in vivo micronucleus the rat. Carcinogenesis Carcinogenicity studies of dimethyl fumarate were conducted for up to 2 years in mice and rats. Dimethyl fumarate was administered orally at doses of 25, 75, 200 and 400 mg/kg/day in mice, and at doses of 25, 50, 100, and 150 mg/kg/day in rats. In mice, the incidence of renal tubular carcinoma was increased at 75 mg/kg/day, at equivalent exposure (AUC) to the recommended human dose. In rats, the incidence of renal tubular carcinoma was increased at 100 mg/kg/day, approximately 3 times higher exposure than the recommended human dose. The relevance of these findings to human risk is unknown. The incidence of squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma in the nonglandular stomach (forestomach) was increased at equivalent exposure to the recommended human dose in mice and below exposure to the recommended human dose in rats (based on AUC). The forestomach in rodents does not have a human counterpart. Toxicology Nonclinical studies in rodent, rabbits, and monkeys were conducted with dimethyl fumarate suspension (dimethyl fumarate in 0.8% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose) administered by oral gavage. The chronic dog study was conducted with oral administration of the dimethyl fumarate capsule. Kidney changes were observed after repeated oral administration of dimethyl fumarate in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys. Renal tubule epithelial regeneration, suggestive of injury, was observed in all species. Renal tubular hyperplasia was observed in rats with life time dosing (2-year study). Cortical atrophy was observed in dogs and monkeys, and single cell necrosis and interstitial fibrosis were observed in monkeys that received daily oral doses of dimethyl fumarate for 12 months, at 6 times the recommended dose based on AUC. The relevance of these findings to humans is not known. In the testes, degeneration of the seminiferous epithelium was seen in rats and dogs. The findings were observed at approximately the recommended dose in rats and 6 times the recommended dose in dogs (AUC basis). The relevance of these findings to humans is not known. Findings in the forestomach of mice and rats consisted of squamous epithelial hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis; inflammation; and squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma in studies of 3 months or longer in duration. The forestomach of mice and rats does not have a human counterpart. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 193/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Reproduction toxicity Oral administration of dimethyl fumarate to male rats at 75, 250, and 375 mg/kg/day prior to and during mating had no effects on male fertility up to the highest dose tested (at least 2 times the recommended dose on an AUC basis). Oral administration of dimethyl fumarate to female rats at 25, 100, and 250 mg/kg/day prior to and during mating, and continuing to Day 7 of gestation, induced reduction in the number of estrous stages per 14 days and increased the number of animals with prolonged diestrus at the highest dose tested (11 times the recommended dose on an AUC basis). However, these changes did not affect fertility or the number of viable fetuses produced. Dimethyl fumarate has been shown to cross the placental membrane into fetal blood in rats and rabbits, with ratios of fetal to maternal plasma concentrations of 0.48 to 0.64 and 0.1 respectively. No malformations were observed at any dose of dimethyl fumarate in rats or rabbits. Administration of dimethyl fumarate at oral doses of 25, 100, and 250 mg/kg/day to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis resulted in maternal adverse effects at 4 times the recommended dose on an AUC basis, and low fetal weight and delayed ossification (metatarsals and hindlimb phalanges) at 11 times the recommended dose on an AUC basis. The lower fetal weight and delayed ossification were considered secondary to maternal toxicity (reduced body weight and food consumption). Oral administration of dimethyl fumarate at 25, 75, and 150 mg/kg/day to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis had no effect on embryo -fetal development and resulted in reduced maternal body weight at 7 times the recommended dose and increased abortion at 16 times the recommended dose, on an AUC basis. Oral administration of dimethyl fumarate at 25, 100, and 250 mg/kg/day to rats during pregnancy and lactation resulted in lower body weights in the F1 offspring, and delays in sexual maturation in F1 males at 11 times the recommended dose on an AUC basis. There were no effects on fertility in the F1 offspring. The lower offspring body weight was considered secondary to maternal toxicity. 6.

Excipient with known effect Each vial contains 2.3 mmol (or 52 mg) sodium. When diluted in 100 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9) the medicinal product contains 17.7 mmol (or 406 mg) sodium. For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Concentrate for solution for infusion. Colourless, clear to slightly opalescent solution. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications TYSABRI is indicated as single disease modifying therapy in highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis for the following patient groups: Adult patients aged 18 years and over with high disease activity despite treatment with a beta- interferon or glatiramer acetate. These patients may be defined as those who have failed to respond to a full and adequate course (normally at least one year of treatment) of beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate. Patients should have had at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on therapy, and have at least 9 T2-hyperintense lesions in cranial Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) or at least 1 Gadolinium -enhancing lesion. A \"non-responder\" could also be defined as a patient with an unchanged or increased relapse rate or ongoing severe relapses, as compared to the previous year. or Adult patients aged 18 years and over with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or more disabling relapses in one year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI. 4.2 Posology and method of administration TYSABRI therapy is to be initiated and continuously supervised by specialised physicians experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological conditions, in centres with timely access to MRI. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 196/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Patients treated with TYSABRI must be given the patient alert card and be informed about the risks of the medicinal product (see also package leaflet). After 2 years of treatment, patients should be re - informed about the risks of TYSABRI, especially the increased risk of Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), and should be instructed together with their caregivers on early signs and symptoms of PML. Resources for the management of hypersensitivity reactions and access to MRI should be available. Patients can switch directly from beta interferon or glatiramer acetate to natalizumab providing there are no signs of relevant treatment -related abnormalities e.g. neutropenia. If there are signs of treatment - related abnormalities these must return to normal before treatment with natalizumab is started. Some patients may have been exposed to immunosuppressive medicinal products (e.g. mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine). These medicinal products have the potential to cause prolonged immunosuppression, even after dosing is discontinued. Therefore the physician must confirm that such patients are not immunocompromised before starting treatment with TYSABRI (see also section 4.4). Posology TYSABRI 300 mg is administered by intravenous infusion once every 4 weeks. Continued therapy must be carefully reconsidered in patients who show no evidence of therapeutic benefit beyond 6 months Data on the safety and efficacy of natalizumab at 2 years were generated from controlled, double - blind studies. After 2 years continued therapy should be considered only following a reassessment of the potential for benefit and risk. Patients should be re-informed about the risk factors for PML, like duration of treatment, immunosuppressant use prior to receiving TYSABRI and the presence of anti- John Cunningham virus (JCV) antibodies (see section 4.4.). Readministration The efficacy of re-administration has not been established, for safety see section 4.4. Special populations Elderly TYSABRI is not recommended for use in patients aged over 65 due to a lack of data in this population. Renal and hepatic impairment Studies have not been conducted to examine the effects of renal or hepatic impairment. The mechanism for elimination and results from population pharmacokinetics suggest that dose adjustment would not be necessary in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Paediatric population TYSABRI is contraindicated in children and adolescents below the age of 18 years (see section 4.3). Method of administration TYSABRI is for intravenous use. For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. After dilution (see section 6.6), the infusion is to be administered over approximately 1 hour and patients are to be observed during the infusion and for 1 hour after the completion of the infusion for signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. TYSABRI must not be administered as a bolus injection. 4.3 Contraindications Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann MA30005, Version Hypersensitivity to natalizumab or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Patients with increased risk for opportunistic infections, including immunocompromised patients (including those currently receiving immunosuppressive therapies or those immunocompromised by prior therapies, e.g. mitoxantrone or cyclophosphamide, see also sections 4.4 and 4.8). Combination with beta-interferons or glatiramer acetate. Known active malignancies, except for patients with cutaneous basal cell carcinoma. Children and adolescents below the age of 18 years. 4.4 Speci al warnings and precautions for use Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) Use of TYSABRI has been associated with an increased risk of PML, an opportunistic infection caused by JC virus, which may be fatal or result in severe disability. Due to this increased risk of developing PML, the benefits and risks of TYSABRI treatment should be individually reconsidered by the specialist physician and the patient; patients must be monitored at regular intervals throughout and should be instructed together with their caregivers on early signs and symptoms of PML. JC virus also causes JCV granule cell neuronopathy (GCN) which has been reported in patients treated with TYSABRI. Symptoms of JCV GCN are similar to symptoms of PML (i.e. cerebellar syndrome). The following risk factors are associated with an increased risk of PML. The presence of anti-JCV antibodies. Treatment duration, especially beyond 2 years. After 2 years all patients should be re-informed about the risk of PML with TYSABRI. Immunosuppressant use prior to receiving TYSABRI. Patients who are anti-JCV antibody positive are at an increased risk of developing PML compared to patients who are anti-JCV antibody negative. Patients who have all three risk factors for PML (i.e., are anti-JCV antibody positive and have received more than 2 years of TYSABRI therapy, and have received prior immunosuppressant therapy) have a significantly higher risk of PML. In anti-JCV antibody positive TYSABRI treated patients who have not used prior immunosuppressants the level of anti-JCV antibody response (index) is associated with the level of risk for PML. In patients considered at high risk treatment with TYSABRI should only be continued if the benefits outweigh the risks. For the estimation of PML risk in the different patient subgroups, please refer to the Physician Information and Management Guidelines. Anti-JCV antibody testing Anti-JCV antibody testing provides supportive information for risk stratification of TYSABRI treatment. Testing for serum anti-JCV antibody prior to initiating TYSABRI therapy or in patients receiving the medicinal product with an unknown antibody status is recommended. Anti-JCV antibody negative patients may still be at risk of PML for reasons such as a new JCV infection, fluctuating antibody status or a false negative test result. Re-testing of anti-JCV antibody negative patients every 6 months is recommended. Retesting low index patients who have no history of prior immunosuppressant use every 6 months once they reach the 2 year treatment point is recommended. The anti-JCV antibody assay (ELISA) should not be used to diagnose PML. Anti-JCV antibody testing should not be performed during, or for at least two weeks following, plasma exchange due to the removal of antibodies from the serum. For further information on anti-JCV antibody testing please see Physician Information and Management Guidelines. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 198/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 MRI screening for PML Before initiation of treatment with TYSABRI, a recent (usually within 3 months) MRI should be available as a reference, and be repeated at least on a yearly basis. More frequent MRIs (e.g. on a 3 to 6 monthly basis) using an abbreviated protocol should be considered for patients at higher risk of PML. This includes: Patients who have all three risk factors for PML (i.e., are anti-JCV antibody positive and have received more than 2 years of TYSABRI therapy, and have received prior immunosuppressant therapy), or Patients with a high anti-JCV antibody index who have received more than 2 years of TYSABRI therapy and without prior history of immunosuppressant therapy. Current evidence suggests that the risk of PML is low at an index equal to or below 0.9 and increases substantially above 1.5 for patients who have been on treatment with TYSABRI for longer than 2 years (see the Physician Information and Management Guidelines for further information). PML should be considered as a differential diagnosis in any MS patient taking TYSABRI presenting with neurological symptoms and/or new brain lesions in MRI. Cases of asymptomatic PML based on MRI and positive JCV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid have been reported. Physicians should refer to the Physician Information and Management Guidelines for further information on managing the risk of PML in TYSABRI -treated patients. If PML or JCV GCN is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded. The clinician should evaluate the patient to determine if the symptoms are indicative of neurological dysfunction and, if so, whether these symptoms are typical of MS or possibly suggestive of PML or JCV GCN. If any doubt exists, further evaluation, including MRI scan preferably with contrast (compared with pre-treatment baseline MRI), CSF testing for JC Viral DNA and repeat neurological assessments, should be considered as described in the Physician Information and Management Guidelines (see educational guidance). Once the clinician has excluded PML and/or JCV GCN (if necessary, by repeating clinical, imaging and/or laboratory investigations if clinical suspicion remains), dosing of TYSABRI may resume. The physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML or JCV GCN that the patient may not notice (e.g. cognitive, psychiatric symptoms or cerebellar syndrome). Patients should also be advised to inform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms that the patient is not aware of. PML has been reported following discontinuation of TYSABRI in patients who did not have findings suggestive of PML at the time of discontinuation. Patients and physicians should continue to follow the same monitoring protocol and be alert for any new signs or symptoms that may be suggestive of PML for approximately 6 months following discontinuation of TYSABRI. If a patient develops PML the dosing of TYSABRI must be permanently discontinued. Following reconstitution of the immune system in immunocompromised patients with PML improved outcome has been seen. PML and IRIS (Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome) IRIS occurs in almost all TYSABRI PML patients after withdrawal or removal of the medicinal product, e.g. by plasma exchange (see section 5.2). IRIS is thought to result from the restoration of immune function in patients with PML, which can lead to serious neurological complications and may be fatal. Monitoring for development of IRIS, which has occurred within days to several weeks after plasma exchange in TYSABRI treated patients with PML, and appropriate treatment of the associated inflammation during recovery from PML should be undertaken (see the Physician Information and Management Guidelines for further information). Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 199/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Infections including other opportunistic infections Other opportunistic infections have been reported with use of TYSABRI, primarily in patients with Crohn's disease who were immunocompromised or where significant co-morbidity existed, however increased risk of other opportunistic infections with use of the medicinal product in patients without these co-morbidities cannot currently be excluded. Opportunistic infections were also detected in MS patients treated with TYSABRI as a monotherapy (see section 4.8). TYSABRI increases the risk of deve zoster viruses. Serious, life-threatening, and sometimes fatal cases have been reported in the postmarketing setting in multiple sclerosis patients receiving TYSABRI (see section 4.8). If herpes encephalitis or meningitis occurs, the medicinal product should be discontinued, and appropriate treatment for herpes encephalitis or meningitis should be administered. Prescribers should be aware of the possibility that other opportunistic infections may occur during TYSABRI therapy and should include them in the differential diagnosis of infections that occur in TYSABRI -treated patients. If an opportunistic infection is suspected, dosing with TYSABRI is to be suspended until such infections can be excluded through further evaluations. If a patient receiving TYSABRI develops an opportunistic infection, dosing of the medicinal product must be permanently discontinued. Educational guidance All physicians who intend to prescribe TYSABRI must ensure they are familiar with the Physician Information and Management Guidelines. Physicians must discuss the benefits and risks of TYSABRI therapy with the patient and provide them with a Patient Alert Card. Patients should be instructed that if they develop any infection then they should inform their physician that they are being treated with TYSABRI. Physicians should counsel patients on the importance of uninterrupted dosing, particularly in the early months of treatment (see hypersensitivity). Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions have been associated with TYSABRI, including serious systemic reactions (see section 4.8). These reactions usually occurred during the infusion or up to 1 hour after completion of the infusion. The risk for hypersensitivity was greatest with early infusions and in patients re-exposed to TYSABRI following an initial short exposure (one or two infusions) and extended period (three months or more) without treatment. However, the risk of hypersensitivity reactions should be considered for every infusion administered. Patients are to be observed during the infusion and for 1 hour after the completion of the infusion (see section 4.8). Resources for the management of hypersensitivity reactions should be available. Discontinue administration of TYSABRI and initiate appropriate therapy at the first symptoms or signs of hypersensitivity. Patients who have experienced a hypersensitivity reaction must be permanently discontinued from treatment with TYSABRI. Concurrent or prior treatment with immunosuppressants The safety and efficacy of TYSABRI in combination with other immunosuppressive and antineoplastic therapies have not been fully established. Concurrent use of these agents with TYSABRI may increase the risk of infections, including opportunistic infections, and is contraindicated (see section 4.3). Patients with a treatment history of immunosuppressant medicinal products are at increased risk for PML. Care should be taken with patients who have previously received immunosuppressants to allow sufficient time for immune function recovery to occur. Physicians must evaluate each individual case to determine whether there is evidence of an immunocompromised state prior to commencing treatment with TYSABRI (see section 4.3). Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 200/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 In Phase 3 MS clinical trials, concomitant treatment of relapses with a short course of corticosteroids was not associated with an increased rate of infection. Short courses of corticosteroids can be used in combination with TYSABRI. Immunogenicity Disease exacerbations or infusion related events may indicate the development of antibodies against natalizumab. In these cases the presence of antibodies should be evaluated and if these remain positive in a confirmatory test after at least 6 weeks, treatment should be discontinued, as persistent antibodies are associated with a substantial decrease in efficacy of TYSABRI and an increased incidence of hypersensitivity reactions (see section 4.8). Since patients who have received an initial short exposure to TYSABRI and then had an extended period without treatment are at a higher risk of developing anti-natalizumab antibodies and/or hypersensitivity upon redosing, the presence of antibodies should be evaluated and if these remain positive in a confirmatory test after at least 6 weeks, the patient should not receive further treatment with TYSABRI. Hepatic events Spontaneous serious adverse reactions of liver injury have been reported during the post marketing phase. These liver injuries may occur at any time during treatment, even after the first dose. In some instances, the reaction reoccurred when TYSABRI was reintroduced. Some patients with a past medical history of an abnormal liver test have experienced an exacerbation of abnormal liver test while on TYSABRI. Patients should be monitored as appropriate for impaired liver function, and be instructed to contact their physician in case signs and symptoms suggestive of liver injury occur, such as jaundice and vomiting. In cases of significant liver injury TYSABRI should be discontinued. Stopping TYSABRI therapy If a decision is made to stop treatment with natalizumab, the physician needs to be aware that natalizumab remains in the blood, and has pharmacodynamic effects (e.g increased lymphocyte counts) for approximately 12 weeks following the last dose. Starting other therapies during this interval will result in a concomitant exposure to natalizumab. For medicinal products such as interferon and glatiramer acetate, concomitant exposure of this duration was not associated with safety risks in clinical trials. No data are available in MS patients regarding concomitant exposure with immunosuppressant medication. Use of these medicinal products soon after the discontinuation of natalizumab may lead to an additive immunosuppressive effect. This should be carefully considered on a case -by-case basis, and a wash -out period of natalizumab might be appropriate. Short courses of steroids used to treat relapses were not associated with increased infections in clinical trials. Sodium content in TYSABRI TYSABRI contains 2.3 mmol (or 52 mg) sodium per vial of medicinal product. When diluted in 100 ml sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9) this medicinal product contains 17.7 mmol (or 406 mg) sodium per dose. To be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium diet. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction TYSABRI is contraindicated in combination with beta-interferons or glatiramer acetate (see section 4.3). Immunisations In a randomised, open label study of 60 patients with relapsing MS there was no significant difference in the humoral immune response to a recall antigen (tetanus toxoid) and only slightly slower and reduced humoral immune response to a neoantigen (keyhole limpet haemocyanin) was observed in patients who were treated with TYSABRI for 6 months compared to an untreated control group. Live vaccines have not been studied. 4.6 Fertility, pregnancy and lactation Pregnancy Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 201/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Data from clinical trials, a prospective pregnancy registry, post-marketing cases and available literature do not suggest an effect of TYSABRI exposure on pregnancy outcomes. The completed prospective TYSABRI pregnancy registry contained 355 pregnancies with available outcomes. There were 316 live births, 29 of which were reported to have birth defects. Sixteen of the 29 were classified as major defects. The rate of defects corresponds to the defect rates reported in other pregnancy registries involving MS patients. There is no evidence of a specific pattern of birth defects with TYSABRI. Cases from published literature reported transient mild to moderate thrombocytopenia and anaemia observed in infants born to women exposed to TYSABRI in their third trimester of pregnancy. Therefore, it is recommended that newborns of women exposed to the medicinal product during the third trimester of pregnancy are monitored for potential haematological abnormalities. If a woman becomes pregnant while taking TYSABRI, discontinuation of the medicinal product should be considered. A benefit -risk evaluation of the use of TYSABRI during pregnancy should take into account the patient's clinical condition and the possible return of disease activity after stopping the medicinal product. Breast -feeding Natalizumab is excreted in human milk. The effect of natalizumab on newborn/infants is unknown. Breast -feeding should be discontinued during treatment with TYSABRI. Fertility Reductions in female guinea pig fertility were observed in one study at doses in excess of the human dose; natalizumab did not affect male fertility. It is considered unlikely that natalizumab will affect fertility performance in humans following the maximum recommended dose. 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed with TYSABRI. However, given that dizziness has been commonly reported, patients who experience this adverse reaction should be advised not to drive or use machines until it has resolved. 4.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the safety profile In placebo -controlled trials in 1,617 MS patients treated with natalizumab for up to 2 years (placebo: 1,135), adverse events leading to discontinuation of therapy occurred in 5.8% of patients treated with natalizumab (placebo: 4.8%). Over the 2-year duration of the studies, 43.5% of patients treated with natalizumab reported adverse reactions (placebo: 39.6%). The highest incidence of adverse reactions identified from placebo -controlled trials in multiple sclerosis patients with natalizumab given at the recommended dose, are reported as dizziness, nausea, urticaria and rigors associated with infusions. Tabulated list of adverse reactions Adverse reactions reported with natalizumab with an incidence of 0.5% greater than reported with placebo are shown below. The reactions are reported as MedDRA preferred terms under the MedDRA primary system organ class. Frequencies were defined as follows: Common ( 1/100 to Roche Ltd 202/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. MedDRA System Organ Class Adverse reaction Frequency category Infections and infestations Urinary tract infection Common Nasopharyngitis Common Immune system disorders Urticaria Common Hypersensitivity Uncommon Nervous system disorders Headache Common Dizziness Common Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) Uncommon Gastrointestinal disorders Vomiting Common Nausea Common Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Arthralgia Common General disorders and administration site conditions Rigors Common Pyrexia Common Fatigue Common Description of selected adverse reactions Infusion reactions In 2-year controlled clinical trials in MS patients, an infusion -related event was defined as an adverse event occurring during the infusion or within 1 hour of the completion of the infusion. These occurred in 23.1% of MS patients treated with natalizumab (placebo: 18.7%). Events reported more commonly with natalizumab than with placebo included dizziness, nausea, urticaria and rigors. Hypersensitivity reactions In 2-year controlled clinical trials in MS patients, hypersensitivity reactions occurred in up to 4% of patients. Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions occurred in less than 1% of patients receiving TYSABRI. Hypersensitivity reactions usually occurred during the infusion or within the 1-hour period after the completion of the infusion (See section 4.4). In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of hypersensitivity reactions which have occurred with one or more of the following associated symptoms: hypotension, hypertension, chest pain, chest discomfort, dyspnoea, angioedema, in addition to more usual symptoms such as rash and urtica ria. Immunogenicity In 10% of patients antibodies against natalizumab were detected in 2-year controlled clinical trials in MS patients. Persistent anti-natalizumab antibodies (one positive test reproducible on retesting at least 6 weeks later) developed in approximately 6% of patients. Antibodies were detected on only one occasion in an additional 4% of patients. Persistent antibodies were associated with a substantial decrease in the effectiveness of TYSABRI and an increased incidence of hypersensitivit y reactions. Additional infusion -related reactions associated with persistent antibodies included rigors, nausea, vomiting and flushing (see section 4.4). If, after approximately 6 months of therapy, persistent antibodies are suspected, either due to reduced efficacy or due to occurrence of infusion -related events, they may be detected and confirmed with a subsequent test 6 weeks after the first positive test. Given that efficacy may be reduced or the incidence of hypersensitivity or infusion -related reactions may be increased in a patient with persistent antibodies, treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop persistent antibodies. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 203/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 Infections, including PML and opportunistic infections In 2-year controlled clinical trials in MS patients, the rate of infection was approximately 1.5 per patient - year in both natalizumab - and placebo -treated patients. The nature of the infections was generally similar in natalizumab - and placebo -treated patients. A case of cryptosporidiu m diarrhoea was reported in MS clinical trials. In other clinical trials, cases of additional opportunistic infections have been reported, some of which were fatal. The majority of patients did not interrupt natalizumab therapy during infections and recovery occurred with appropriate treatment. In clinical trials, herpes infections (Varicella -Zoster virus, Herpes -simplex virus) occurred slightly more frequently in natalizumab -treated patients than in placebo -treated patients. In post marketing experience,serious, life-threatening, and sometimes fatal cases of encephalitis and meningitis caused by herpes simplex or varicella zoster have been reported in multiple sclerosis patients receiving TYSABRI. The duration of treatment with TYSABRI prior to onset ranged from a few months to several years (see section 4.4). Cases of PML have been reported from clinical trials, post-marketing observational studies and post - marketing passive surveillance. PML usually leads to severe disability or death (see section 4.4). Cases of JCV GCN have also been reported during postmarketing use of TYSABRI. Symptoms of JCV GCN are similar to PML. Hepatic events Spontaneous cases of serious liver injuries, increased liver enzymes, hyperbilirubinaemia have been reported during the post marketing phase (see section 4.4). Anaemia and haemolytic anaemia Rare, serious cases of anaemia and haemolytic anaemia have been reported in patients treated with TYSABRI in post-marketing observational studies. Malignancies No differences in incidence rates or the nature of malignancies between natalizumab - and placebo -treated patients were observed over 2 years of treatment. However, observation over longer treatment periods is required before any effect of natalizumab on malignancies can be excluded. See section 4.3. Effects on laboratory tests In 2-year controlled clinical trials in MS patients TYSABRI treatment was associated with increases in circulating lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils and nucleated red blood cells. Elevations in neutrophils were not seen. Increases from baseline for lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils ranged from 35% to 140% for individual cell types but mean cell counts remained within normal ranges. During treatment with TYSABRI, small reductions in haemoglobin (mean decrease 0.6 g/dl), haematocrit (mean decrease 2%) and red blood cell counts (mean decrease 0.1 x 106/l) were seen. All changes in haematological variables returned to pre-treatment values, usually within 16 weeks of last dose of the medicinal product and the changes were not associated with clinical symptoms. In post-marketing experience, there have also been reports of eosinophilia (eosinophil count >1,500/mm3) without clinical symptoms. In such cases where TYSABRI therapy was discontinued the elevated eosinophil levels resolved. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose No case of overdose has reported. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 204/Protocol MA30005, PROPERTIES adhesion and binds to the 4-subunit of human integrins, which is highly expressed on the surface of all leukocytes, with the exception of neutrophils. Specifically, natalizumab binds to the 41 integrin, blocking the interaction with its cognate receptor, molecule -1 of fibronectin, connecting segment -1 (CS-1). Natalizumab blocks the interaction of addressin cell adhesion molecule -1 (MadCAM interactions mononuclear leukocytes across the endothelium into inflamed parenchymal tissue. A further mechanism of action of natalizumab may be to suppress ongoing inflammatory reactions in diseased tissues by inhibiting the interaction of 4-expressing leukocytes with their ligands in the extracellular matrix and on parenchymal cells. As such, natalizumab may act to suppress inflammatory activity present at the disease site, and inhibit further recruitment of immune cells into inflamed tissues. In MS, lesions are believed to occur when activated T-lymphocytes cross the blood -brain barrier (BBB). Leukocyte migration across the BBB involves interaction between adhesion molecules on inflammatory cells and endothelial cells of the vessel wall. The interaction between 41 and its target s is an important component of pathological inflammation in the brain and disruption of these interactions leads to reduced inflammation. Under normal conditions, VCAM -1 is not expressed in the brain parenchyma. However, in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, VCAM -1 is upregulated on endothelial cells and possibly on glial cells near the sites of inflammation. In the setting of central nervous system (CNS) inflammation in MS, it is the interaction of 41 with VCAM -1, CS-1 and osteopontin that mediates the transmigration of leukocytes into the brain parenchyma and may perpetuate the inflammatory cascade in CNS tissue. Blockade of the molecular interactions of 41 with its targets reduces inflammatory activity present in the br ain in MS and inhibits further recruitment of immune cells into inflamed tissue, thus reducing the formation or enlargement of MS lesions. Clinical efficacy Efficacy as monotherapy has been evaluated in one randomised, double -blind, placebo -controlled study lasting 2 years (AFFIRM study) in relapsing -remitting MS patients who had experienced at least 1 clinical relapse during the year prior to entry and had a Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score between 0 and 5. Median age was 37 years, with a median disease duration of 5 years. The patients were randomised with a 2:1 ratio to receive TYSABRI 300 mg (n = 627) or placebo (n = 315) every 4 weeks for up to 30 infusions. Neurological evaluations were performed every 12 weeks and at times of suspected relapse. MRI evaluations for T1-weighted gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions and T2-hyperintense lesions were performed annually. Study features and results are presented in the table below.

In the sub-group of patients indicated for treatment of rapidly evolving relapsing remitting MS (patients with 2 or more relapses and 1 or more Gd+ lesion), the annualised relapse rate was 0.282 in the TYSABRI treated group (n = 148) and 1.455 in the placebo group (n = 61) (p <0.001). Hazard ratio for disability progression was 0.36 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.76) p = 0.008. These results were obtained from a post hoc analysis and should be interpreted cautiously. No information on the severity of the relapses before inclusion of patients in the study is available. Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 206/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with TYSABRI in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in multiple sclerosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties Following the repeat intravenous administration of a 300 mg dose of natalizumab to MS patients, the mean maximum observed serum concentration was 110 \u00b1 52 g/ml. Mean average steady -state trough natalizumab concentrations over the dosing period ranged from 23 g/ml to 29 g/ml. The predicted time to steady -state was approximately 36 weeks. A population pharmacokinetics analysis was conducted on samples from over 1,100 MS patients receiving doses ranging from 3 to 6 mg/kg natalizumab. Of these, 581 patients received a fixed 300 mg dose as monotherapy. The mean \u00b1 SD steady -state clearance was 13.1 \u00b1 5.0 ml/h, with a mean \u00b1 SD half -life of 16 \u00b1 4 days. The analysis explored the effects of selected covariates including body weight, age, gender, hepatic and renal function, and presence of anti-natalizumab antibodies upon pharmacokinetics. Only body weight and the presence of anti-natalizumab antibodies were found to influence natalizumab disposition. Body weight was found to influence clearance in a less-than- proportional manner, such that a 43% change in body weight resulted in a 31% to 34% change in clearance. The change in clearance was not clinically significant. The presence of persistent anti- natalizumab antibodies increased natalizumab clearance approximately 3-fold, consistent with reduced serum natalizumab concentrations observed in persistently antibody -positive patients , (see section 4.8). The pharmacokinetics of natalizumab in paediatric MS patients or in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency has not been studied. The effect of plasma exchange on natalizumab clearance and pharmacodynamics was evaluated in a study of 12 MS patients. Estimates of the total natalizumab removal after 3 plasma exchanges (over a 5-8 day interval) was approximately 70-80%. This compares to approximately 40% seen in earlier studies in which measurements occurred after natalizumab discontinuation over a similar period of observation. The impact of plasma exchange on the restitution of lymphocyte migration and ultimately its clinical usefulness is unknown. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. Consistent with the pharmacological activity of natalizumab, altered trafficking of lymphocytes was seen as white blood cell increases as well as increased spleen weights in most in vivo studies. These changes were reversible and did not appear to have any adverse toxicological consequences. In studies conducted in mice, growth and metastasis of melanoma and lymphoblastic leukaemia tumour cells was not increased by the administration of natalizumab. No clastogenic or mutagenic effects of natalizumab were observed in the Ames or human chromosomal aberration assays. Natalizumab showed no effects on in vitro assays of 4-integrin -positive tumour line proliferation or cytotoxicity. Reductions in female guinea pig fertility were observed in one study at doses in excess of the human dose; natalizumab did not affect male fertility. The effect of natalizumab on reproduction was evaluated in 5 studies, 3 in guinea pigs and 2 in cynomolgus monkeys. These studies showed no evidence of teratogenic effects or effects on growth of offspring. In one study in guinea pigs, a small reduction in pup survival was noted. In a study in monkeys, the number of abortions was doubled in the natal izumab 30 mg/kg treatment groups versus matching control groups. This was the result of a high incidence of abortions in treated groups in the first cohort that was not observed in the second cohort. No effects on abortion rates were noted in any other study. A study in pregnant cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated natalizumab -related changes in the foetus that included mild anaemia, reduced platelet counts, increased spleen weights and reduced liver and thymus weights. These changes were associated with increased thymic atrophy and decreased hepatic haematopoiesis. Platelet counts were also reduced in offspring born to mothers treated with natalizumab until parturition, however there was no evidence of anaemia in these Ocrelizumab \u2014F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd 207/Protocol MA30005, Version 5 offspring. All changes were observed at doses in excess of the human dose and were reversed upon clearance of natalizumab. In cynomolgus monkeys treated with natalizumab until parturition, low levels of natalizumab were detected in the breast milk of some animals. 6.
