SIDE EFFECTS Systemic and local corticosteroid use may result in the following: - Somnolence [see WARNINGS AND WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#P)] - WARNINGS [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#P)] - Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) effects, including growth reduction [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#P), [Use In Specific Populations](/ticlast-drug.htm#USP)] Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect rates observed in practice. Adults And Adolescents 12 Years Of Age And Older The safety data described below in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older reflect exposure to DYMISTA in 853 patients (12 years of age and older; 36% male and 64% female) with seasonal allergic rhinitis in 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 2-week duration. The racial distribution for the 3 clinical trials was 80% white, 16% black, 2% Asian, and 1% other. In the 3 placebo controlled clinical trials of 2-week duration, 3411 patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated with 1 spray per nostril of DYMISTA, azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, fluticasone propionate nasal daily. The azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators use the same vehicle and device as DYMISTA and are not commercially marketed. Overall, adverse reactions were 16% in the DYMISTA treatment groups, 15% in the azelastine nasal spray groups, 13% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray groups, and 12% in the placebo groups. Overall, 1% of patients in both the DYMISTA and placebo groups discontinued due to adverse reactions. Table 1 contains adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than or equal to 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with DYMISTA in the seasonal allergic rhinitis controlled clinical trials. Table 1. Adverse Reactions with 2% Incidence and More Frequently than Placebo in Placebo- Controlled Trials of 2 Weeks Duration with DYMISTA in Adult and Adolescent Patients With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis |1 spray per nostril twice population Not commercially marketed In the above trials, somnolence was reported in <1% of patients treated with DYMISTA (6 of 853) or vehicle placebo (1 of 861) [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#P)]. Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years Of Age The safety data described below in children 6-11 years of age reflect exposure to DYMISTA in 152 patients (6-11 years of age; 57% male and 43% female) with seasonal allergic rhinitis in one doubleblind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 2-week duration. The racial distribution for the clinical trial was 69% white, 31% black, 2% Asian and 2% other. In the placebo-controlled clinical trial of 2-week duration, patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were treated with 1 spray per nostril of DYMISTA or placebo, twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 16% in the DYMISTA treatment group, and 12% in the placebo group. Overall, 1% of patients in both the DYMISTA and placebo groups discontinued due to adverse reactions. Table 2 contains adverse reactions reported with frequencies greater than or equal to 2% and more frequently than placebo in patients treated with DYMISTA in the seasonal allergic rhinitis controlled clinical trial. Table 2. Adverse Reactions with 2% Incidence and More Frequently than Placebo in Placebo- Controlled Trials of 2 Weeks Duration with DYMISTA in Children 6 to 11 Years of Age With Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis |1 spray per nostril trial, somnolence was not reported [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#P)]. Long-Term (12-Month) Safety Trial In Adults And Adolescents 12 Years Of Age And Older In the 12-month open-label, active-controlled clinical trial, 404 Asian patients (240 males and 164 females) with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with DYMISTA, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 12-month, open-label, active-controlled, long-term safety trial in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older, 404 patients with perennial allergic rhinitis or vasomotor rhinitis were treated with DYMISTA 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 207 patients were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 2 sprays per nostril once daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 47% in the DYMISTA treatment group and 44% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions ( 2%) with DYMISTA were headache, pyrexia, cough, nasal congestion, rhinitis, dysgeusia, viral infection, upper respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, pain, diarrhea, and epistaxis. In the DYMISTA treatment group, 7 patients (2%) had mild epistaxis and 1 patient (<1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 1 patient (<1%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no nasal ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Eleven of 404 patients (3%) treated with DYMISTA and 6 of 207 patients (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse events. Long-Term (3-Month) Safety Trial In Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years Of Age In the 3-month open label active-controlled clinical trial, 264 patients (60% male, 40% female) (80% white, 19% black, 4% Asian and 2% other) with allergic rhinitis were treated with DYMISTA, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. In the 3-month, open label, active-controlled, safety trial in pediatric patients 6-11 years of age 264 patients (128 patients 6 to <9 years of age, and 136 patients 9 to <12 years of age) with allergic rhinitis (based on the Investigator's assessment) were treated with DYMISTA, 1 spray per nostril twice daily and 89 patients (44 patients 6 to <9 years of age, and 45 patients 9 to <12 years of age) were treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray, 1 spray per nostril twice daily. Overall, adverse reactions were 40% in the DYMISTA treatment group and 36% in the fluticasone propionate nasal spray group. The most frequently reported adverse reactions (2%) with DYMISTA were epistaxis, headache, oropharyngeal pain, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, cough, pyrexia, otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, nausea, otitis externa, and urticaria. In the DYMISTA treatment group 23 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis and 3 patients (1%) had moderate epistaxis. In the fluticasone propionate nasal spray treatment group 8 patients (9%) had mild epistaxis. No patients had reports of severe epistaxis. Focused nasal examinations were performed and no ulcerations or septal perforations were observed. Four of 264 patients (2%) treated with DYMISTA and 3 of 89 (3%) treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray discontinued from the trial due to adverse events. There were two reports of somnolence, one severe, among children taking DYMISTA [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#P)]. Postmarketing Experience The following spontaneous adverse events have been reported with DYMISTA or one of the components (azelastine and fluticasone). Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: atrial fibrillation, increased heart rate, palpitations Eye disorder: blurred vision, cataracts, conjunctivitis, dryness and irritation, eye swelling, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, vision abnormal, xerophthalmia Gastrointestinal disorders: nausea, vomiting General disorders and administration site condition: aches and pain, application site irritation, chest pain, edema of face and tongue, fatigue, tolerance Immune system disorders: anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions which in rare instances were severe, hypersensitivity reactions Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: growth suppression [see [Use In Specific Populations](/ticlast-drug.htm#USP)] Nervous system disorders: disturbance or loss of smell and/ or taste, dizziness, involuntary muscle contractions, paresthesia, parosmia Psychiatric disorders: anxiety, confusion, nervousness Renal ulcer, sore throat, throat dryness and irritation, voice changes, wheezing Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorder: angioedema, erythema, face swelling, pruritus, rash, urticaria Vascular disorder: hypertension DRUG INTERACTIONS No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with DYMISTA. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. Central Nervous System Depressants Concurrent use of DYMISTA with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because somnolence and impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#P)]. Cytochrome P450 following administration of fluticasone propionate aqueous [see [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](/ticlast-drug.htm#CP)]. During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Ketoconazole (also a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor), administered in multiple 200 mg doses to steady-state, increased plasma exposure of fluticasone propionate, reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol, following administration of a single 1000 mcg dose of fluticasone propionate by oral inhalation route. Caution should be exercised when DYMISTA is coadministered with ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

Caution should be exercised when DYMISTA is coadministered with ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. WARNINGS Included as part of the PRECAUTIONS section. PRECAUTIONS Somnolence In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients (6 of 853 adult and adolescent patients and 2 of 416 children) taking DYMISTA in placebo controlled trials [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#AR)]. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after administration of DYMISTA. Concurrent use of DYMISTA with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see [DRUG INTERACTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#DI)]. Local Nasal Effects In clinical trials of 2 to 52 weeks' duration, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients treated with DYMISTA than those who received placebo [see nasal ulceration and nasal have been reported in patients following the intranasal application of corticosteroids. There were no instances of nasal ulceration or nasal septal perforation observed in clinical trials with DYMISTA. Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid use of DYMISTA until healing has occurred. In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered intranasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of treatment with DYMISTA. Patients using DYMISTA over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Glaucoma And Cataracts Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation were evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in a controlled 12-month study in 612 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older with perennial allergic or vasomotor rhinitis (VMR). Of the 612 patients enrolled in the study, 405 were randomized to receive DYMISTA (1 spray per nostril twice daily) and 207 were randomized to receive fluticasone propionate nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril once daily). In the DYMISTA group, one patient had increased intraocular pressure at month 6. In addition, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 6 and one at month 12 (end of treatment). In the fluticasone propionate group, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 12 (end of treatment). Immunosuppression Persons who are using drugs, such as corticosteroids, that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Effects When intranasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear. If such changes occur, the dosage of DYMISTA should be discontinued slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for discontinuing oral corticosteroid therapy. The concomitant use of intranasal corticosteroids with other inhaled corticosteroids could increase the risk of signs or symptoms of hypercorticism and/or suppression of the HPA axis. The replacement of a systemic corticosteroid with a topical corticosteroid can be accompanied by signs of adrenal insufficiency, and in addition some patients may experience symptoms of withdrawal, e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, and depression. Patients previously treated for prolonged periods with systemic corticosteroids and transferred to topical corticosteroids should be carefully monitored for acute adrenal insufficiency in response to stress. In those patients who have asthma or other clinical conditions requiring long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment, too rapid a decrease in systemic corticosteroids may cause a severe exacerbation of their symptoms. Use Of Cytochrome P450 and other strong inhibitors can significantly increase plasma fluticasone in significantly INTERACTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#DI) and [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](/ticlast-drug.htm#CP)]. During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate and ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing syndrome and adrenal suppression. Therefore, coadministration of DYMISTA and ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Use caution with the coadministration of DYMISTA and other potent CYP3A4 INTERACTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#DI) and [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](/ticlast-drug.htm#CP)]. Effect On Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving DYMISTA [see Use in Specific Populations]. Patient Counseling Information See FDA-approved patient labeling ( [PATIENT INFORMATION and Instructions for Use](/ticlast-drug.htm#PI)) Somnolence Somnolence has been reported in some patients (8 of 1,269 patients) taking DYMISTA in controlled clinical trials. Caution patients against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as driving or operating machinery after administration of DYMISTA [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Concurrent Use Of Alcohol And Other Central Nervous System Depressants Advise patients to avoid concurrent use of DYMISTA with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Local Nasal albicans infection healing. Patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should not use DYMISTA until healing has occurred [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Glaucoma And Cataracts Inform patients that glaucoma and cataracts are associated with nasal and inhaled corticosteroid use. Advise patients to inform his/her health care provider if a change in vision is noted while using DYMISTA [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Immunosuppression Warn patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to consult their physician without delay. Inform patients of potential worsening of existing tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS]. Effect On Growth Corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth routinely of pediatric patients receiving DYMISTA [see Use in Specific Populations]. Priming Instruct patients to shake the bottle gently before each use and prime the pump before initial use and when DYMISTA has not been used for 14 or more days [see [DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION](/ticlast-drug.htm#DAA)]. Keep Spray Out of Eyes Instruct patients to avoid spraying DYMISTA into their eyes. Keep Out Of Children's Reach Instruct patients to keep DYMISTA out of the reach of children. If a child accidentally ingests DYMISTA, seek medical help or call a poison control center immediately. Potential Drug Interactions Advise patients that coadministration of DYMISTA and ritonavir is not recommended and to be cautious DYMISTA No studies of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, or impairment of fertility were conducted with DYMISTA; however, studies are available for the individual active components, azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate, as described below. Azelastine Hydrochloride In 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice, azelastine hydrochloride did not show evidence of carcinogenicity at oral doses up to 30 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg, respectively. These doses were approximately 530 and 220 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose [MRHDID] on a mg/m\u00b2 basis. Azelastine hydrochloride showed no genotoxic effects in the Ames test, DNA repair test, mouse lymphoma forward mutation assay, mouse micronucleus test, or chromosomal aberration test in rat bone marrow. Reproduction and fertility studies in rats showed no effects on male or female fertility at oral doses up to 30 mg/kg (approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults on a mg/m\u00b2 basis). At 68.6 mg/kg (approximately 1200 times the MRHDID on a mg/m\u00b2 basis), the duration of estrous cycles was prolonged and copulatory activity and the number of pregnancies were decreased. The numbers of corpora lutea and implantations were decreased; Fluticasone Propionate Fluticasone propionate demonstrated no tumorigenic potential in mice at oral doses up to 1,000 mcg/kg (approximately 20 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in adults and approximately 10 times the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in children on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis) for 78 weeks or in rats at inhalation doses up to 57 mcg/kg (approximately 2 times the MRHDID in adults on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis) for 104 weeks. Fluticasone propionate did not induce gene mutation in prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells in vitro. No significant clastogenic effect was seen in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes in vitro or in the mouse micronucleus test. No evidence of impairment of fertility was observed in reproductive studies conducted in male and female rats at subcutaneous doses up to 50 mcg/kg (approximately 2 times the MRHDID in adults on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis). Prostate weight was significantly reduced at a subcutaneous dose of 50 mcg/kg. Use In Specific Populations Pregnancy DYMISTA - Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical trials of DYMISTA, azelastine hydrochloride only, or fluticasone propionate only in pregnant women. Animal reproductive studies of azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate in mice, rats, and/or rabbits revealed evidence of teratogenicity as well as other developmental toxic effects. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, DYMISTA should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Azelastine Hydrochloride Teratogenic Effects : In mice, azelastine hydrochloride caused embryo-fetal death, malformations (cleft palate; short or absent tail; fused, absent or branched ribs), delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at an oral dose approximately 610 times the maximum recommended human daily intranasal dose (MRHDID) in adults (on a mg/m\u00b2 basis at a maternal dose of 68.6 mg/kg). This dose also caused maternal toxicity as evidenced by decreased body weight. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at a dose that was approximately 26 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m basis at a maternal dose of 3 mg/kg). In rats, azelastine hydrochloride caused malformations (oligo- and brachydactylia), delayed ossification and skeletal variations, in the absence of maternal toxicity, at an oral dose approximately 530 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m\u00b2 basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg). At a dose approximately 1200 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m\u00b2 basis at a maternal dose of 68.6 mg/kg), azelastine hydrochloride also caused embryo-fetal death and decreased fetal weight; however, this dose caused severe maternal toxicity. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at a dose approximately 53 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m\u00b2 basis at a maternal dose of 3 mg/kg). In rabbits, azelastine hydrochloride caused abortion, delayed ossification, and decreased fetal weight at oral doses approximately 1100 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mg/m basis at a maternal dose of 30 mg/kg); however, these doses also resulted in severe maternal toxicity. Neither fetal nor maternal effects occurred at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHDID (on a mg/m\u00b2 basis at a maternal dose of 0.3 mg/kg). Fluticasone Propionate Teratogenic Effects : Corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. Subcutaneous studies in the mouse and rat at doses approximately equivalent to and 4 times, respectively, the MRHDID in adults (on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis at maternal doses of 45 and 100 mcg/kg, respectively), revealed fetal toxicity characteristic of potent corticosteroid compounds, including embryonic growth retardation, omphalocele, cleft palate, and retarded cranial ossification. In the rabbit, fetal weight reduction and cleft palate were observed at a subcutaneous dose less than the MRHDID in adults (on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis at a maternal dose of 4 mcg/kg). However, no teratogenic effects were reported at oral doses up to approximately 25 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis at a maternal dose of 300 mcg/kg) of fluticasone propionate to the rabbit. No fluticasone propionate was detected in the plasma in this study, consistent with the established low bioavailability following oral administration [see [CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY](/ticlast-drug.htm#CP)]. Experience with oral corticosteroids since their introduction in pharmacologic, as opposed to physiologic, doses suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. In addition, because there is a natural increase in corticosteroid production during pregnancy, most women will require a lower exogenous corticosteroid dose and many will not need corticosteroid treatment during pregnancy. Nonteratogenic Effects Fluticasone propionate crossed the placenta following oral administration of approximately 4 and 25 times the MRHDID in adults (on a mcg/m basis at maternal doses of 100 mcg/kg and 300 mcg/kg to rats and rabbits, respectively). Nursing Mothers DYMISTA: It is not known whether DYMISTA is excreted in human breast milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when DYMISTA is administered to a nursing woman. Since there are no data from well-controlled human studies on the use of DYMISTA by nursing mothers, based on data from the individual components, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue DYMISTA, taking into account the importance of DYMISTA to the mother. Azelastine hydrochloride: It is not known if azelastine hydrochloride is excreted in human milk. Fluticasone propionate: It is not known if fluticasone propionate is excreted in human milk. However, other corticosteroids are excreted in human milk. Subcutaneous administration to lactating rats of 10 mcg/kg of tritiated fluticasone propionate (less than the maximum recommended daily intranasal dose in adults on a mcg/m\u00b2 basis) resulted in measurable radioactivity in the milk. Pediatric Use Use of DYMISTA for seasonal allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 6 to 11 years of age is supported by safety and efficacy data from clinical studies (416 patients 6 to 11 years of age with allergic rhinitis were treated with DYMISTA in controlled clinical trials) and the established efficacy and safety of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray and fluticasone propionate nasal and [Clinical Studies](/ticlast-drug.htm#CS)]. Sixty-one patients ages 4-5 years of age were treated with DYMISTA in the pediatric studies described above. Safety findings in children 4-5 years of age were similar to those in children 6-11 years of age, but efficacy was not established. Safety and effectiveness of DYMISTA has not been studied in pediatric patients below the age of 4 years. Controlled clinical studies have shown that intranasal corticosteroids may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of HPA axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with intranasal corticosteroids, including the impact on final adult height, are unknown. The potential for \"catch-up\" growth following discontinuation of treatment with intranasal corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. The growth of pediatric patients receiving intranasal corticosteroids, including DYMISTA, should be monitored routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against the clinical benefits obtained and the risks/benefits of treatment alternatives. Geriatric Use Clinical trials of DYMISTA did not include sufficient numbers of patients 65 years of age and older to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. WARNINGS Included as part of the \"PRECAUTIONS\" Section PRECAUTIONS Somnolence In clinical trials, the occurrence of somnolence has been reported in some patients (6 of 853 adult and adolescent patients and 2 of 416 children) taking DYMISTA in placebo controlled trials [see [ADVERSE REACTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#AR)]. Patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and motor coordination such as operating machinery or driving a motor vehicle after administration of DYMISTA. Concurrent use of DYMISTA with alcohol or other central nervous system depressants should be avoided because additional reductions in alertness and additional impairment of central nervous system performance may occur [see [DRUG INTERACTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#DI)]. Local Nasal Effects In clinical trials of 2 to 52 weeks' duration, epistaxis was observed more frequently in patients treated with DYMISTA than those who received placebo [see nasal ulceration and nasal have been reported in patients following the intranasal application of corticosteroids. There were no instances of nasal ulceration or nasal septal perforation observed in clinical trials with DYMISTA. Because of the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on wound healing, patients who have experienced recent nasal ulcers, nasal surgery, or nasal trauma should avoid use of DYMISTA until healing has occurred. In clinical trials with fluticasone propionate administered intranasally, the development of localized infections of the nose and pharynx with Candida albicans has occurred. When such an infection develops, it may require treatment with appropriate local therapy and discontinuation of treatment with DYMISTA. Patients using DYMISTA over several months or longer should be examined periodically for evidence of Candida infection or other signs of adverse effects on the nasal mucosa. Glaucoma And Cataracts Nasal and inhaled corticosteroids may result in the development of glaucoma and/or cataracts. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. Glaucoma and cataract formation were evaluated with intraocular pressure measurements and slit lamp examinations in a controlled 12-month study in 612 adolescent and adult patients aged 12 years and older with perennial allergic or vasomotor rhinitis (VMR). Of the 612 patients enrolled in the study, 405 were randomized to receive DYMISTA (1 spray per nostril twice daily) and 207 were randomized to receive fluticasone propionate nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril once daily). In the DYMISTA group, one patient had increased intraocular pressure at month 6. In addition, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 6 and one at month 12 (end of treatment). In the fluticasone propionate group, three patients had evidence of posterior subcapsular cataract at month 12 (end of treatment). Immunosuppression Persons who are using drugs, such as corticosteroids, that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infections than healthy individuals. Chickenpox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affect the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chickenpox, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) may be If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chickenpox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. Corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal or bacterial infections; systemic viral or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex because of the potential for worsening of these infections. Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis Effects When intranasal steroids are used at higher than recommended dosages or in susceptible individuals at recommended dosages, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression may appear.

OVERDOSE DYMISTA DYMISTA contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to DYMISTA. Azelastine Hydrochloride There have been no reported overdosages with azelastine hydrochloride. Acute azelastine hydrochloride overdosage by adults with this dosage form is unlikely to result in clinically significant adverse events, other than increased somnolence, since one (1) 23 g bottle of DYMISTA contains approximately 23 mg of azelastine hydrochloride. Clinical trials in adults with single doses of the oral formulation of azelastine hydrochloride (up to 16 mg) have not resulted in increased incidence of serious adverse events. General supportive measures should be employed if overdosage occurs. There is no known antidote to DYMISTA. Oral ingestion of antihistamines has the potential to cause serious adverse effects in children. Accordingly, DYMISTA should be kept out of the reach of children. Fluticasone Propionate Chronic fluticasone propionate overdosage [see WARNINGS AND [PRECAUTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#P)]. Intranasal administration of 2 mg (10 times the recommended dose) of fluticasone propionate twice daily for 7 days to healthy human volunteers was well tolerated. Single oral fluticasone propionate doses up to 16 mg have been studied in human volunteers with no acute toxic effects reported. Repeat oral doses up to 80 mg daily for 10 days in volunteers and repeat oral doses up to 10 mg daily for 14 days in patients were well tolerated. Adverse reactions were of mild or moderate severity, and incidences were similar in active and placebo treatment groups. Acute overdosage with this dosage form is unlikely since one (1) 23 g bottle of DYMISTA contains approximately 8.5 mg of fluticasone propionate. CONTRAINDICATIONS fluticasone propionate; therefore, the risks associated with overdosage for the individual components described below apply to DYMISTA. Azelastine Hydrochloride There have been no reported overdosages with azelastine hydrochloride.

Intranasal administration of 2 mg (10 times the recommended dose) of fluticasone propionate twice daily for 7 days to healthy human volunteers was well tolerated. Single oral fluticasone propionate doses up to 16 mg have been studied in human volunteers with no acute toxic effects reported. Repeat oral doses up to 80 mg daily for 10 days in volunteers and repeat oral doses up to 10 mg daily for 14 days in patients were well tolerated. Adverse reactions were of mild or moderate severity, and incidences were similar in active and placebo treatment groups. Acute overdosage with this dosage form is unlikely since one (1) 23 g bottle of DYMISTA contains approximately 8.5 mg of fluticasone propionate. CONTRAINDICATIONS None. CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Mechanism Of contains both azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate; therefore, the mechanisms of actions described below for the individual components apply to DYMISTA. These drugs represent two different classes of medications (histamine H1 -receptor antagonist and synthetic derivative, exhibits histamine H1 - receptor antagonist activity in isolated tissues, animal models, and humans. Azelastine hydrochloride in DYMISTA is administered as a racemic mixture with no difference in pharmacologic activity noted between the enantiomers in in vitro studies. The major metabolite, desmethylazelastine, H -receptor corticosteroid with antiinflammatory activity. In vitro dose response studies on a cloned human glucocorticoid receptor system involving binding and gene expression afforded 50% responses at 1.25 and 0.17 nM concentrations, respectively. Fluticasone propionate was 3-fold to 5-fold more potent than dexamethasone in these assays. Data from the McKenzie vasoconstrictor assay in man also support its potent glucocorticoid activity. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. The precise mechanism through which fluticasone propionate affects allergic rhinitis symptoms is not known. Corticosteroids have been shown to have a wide range of effects on multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, involved in inflammation. Pharmacodynamics Cardiac Effects In a placebo-controlled trial (95 patients with allergic rhinitis), there was no evidence of an effect of azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray (2 sprays per nostril twice daily for 56 days) on cardiac repolarization as represented by the corrected QT interval (QTc) of the electrocardiogram. Following multiple dose oral administration of azelastine 4 mg or 8 mg twice daily, the mean change in QTc was 7.2 msec and 3.6 msec, respectively. Interaction studies investigating the cardiac repolarization effects of concomitantly administered oral azelastine hydrochloride and erythromycin or ketoconazole were conducted. These drugs had no effect on QTc based on analysis of serial electrocardiograms. Pharmacokinetics Absorption After intranasal administration of two sprays per nostril (548 mcg of azelastine hydrochloride and 200 mcg of fluticasone) of DYMISTA, the mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) plasma (Cmax The median time to peak exposure (tmax ) from a single dose was 0.5 hours for azelastine and 1.0 hours for fluticasone. Systemic bioavailability of azelastine from DYMISTA following low intranasal bioavailability, pharmacokinetic data for fluticasone propionate were obtained via other routes of administration. Studies using oral dosing of radiolabeled fluticasone propionate showed negligible oral bioavailability and high extraction from plasma. The majority of the circulating radioactivity was due to an inactive metabolite. Distribution Based on intravenous and oral administration, the steady-state volume of distribution of azelastine hydrochloride is 14.5 L/kg. In vitro studies with human plasma indicate that the plasma protein binding of azelastine hydrochloride and its metabolite, desmethylazelastine, are approximately 88% and 97%, respectively. Following intravenous administration, the initial disposition phase for fluticasone propionate was rapid and consistent with its high lipid solubility and tissue binding. The volume of distribution averaged 4.2 L/kg. The percentage of fluticasone propionate bound to human plasma proteins averaged 91% with no obvious concentration relationship. Fluticasone propionate is weakly and reversibly bound to erythrocytes and freely equilibrates between erythrocytes and plasma. Fluticasone propionate is not significantly bound to human transcortin. Metabolism Azelastine hydrochloride is oxidatively metabolized to the principal active metabolite, desmethylazelastine, by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. isoforms responsible for the biotransformation of azelastine have not been identified. The total clearance of azelastine is approximately 0.50 L/kg/hr. For fluticasone propionate, the only circulating metabolite detected in man is the 17-carboxylic acid derivative, which is formed through the CYP3A4 pathway. This inactive metabolite had less affinity (approximately 1/2,000) than the parent drug for the glucocorticoid receptor of human lung cytosol in vitro and negligible pharmacological activity in animal studies. Other metabolites detected in vitro using cultured human hepatoma cells have not been detected in man. The average total clearance of fluticasone propionate is relatively high (approximately 66 L/hr). Elimination Following intranasal administration of DYMISTA, the elimination half-life of azelastine hydrochloride is approximately 25 hours. Approximately 75% of an oral dose of radiolabeled azelastine hydrochloride was excreted in the feces with less 10% as Following intravenous dosing, fluticasone kinetics and had a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 7.8 hours. Less than 5% of a radiolabeled oral dose was excreted in the urine as metabolites, with the remainder excreted in the feces as parent drug and metabolites. Special Populations DYMISTA was not studied in any special populations, and no gender-specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained. Hepatic Impairment Following oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment Based on oral, single-dose studies of azelastine hydrochloride, renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50 mL/min) resulted in a 70-75% higher Cmax and AUC compared to healthy subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age Following oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age. Gender Following oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by gender. Race The effect of race has not been evaluated. Drug-Drug Interactions No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with DYMISTA. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. Erythromycin Coadministration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days) resulted in C of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ng.h/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in C of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL and AUC of 48.4 \u00b1 24 azelastine. In another drug study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg three times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine And Ranitidine In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. Coadministration of orally administered azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily) resulted in C of hydrochloride, whereas, administration of alone resulted in C of significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the coadministration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily. Ritonavir Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction study in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (Cmax ) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range, 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC(0-) averaged 8.43 pghr/mL (range, 4.2 to 18.8 Fluticasone propionate Cmax and increased spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in plasma cortisol area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC). Caution should be exercised when other strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are coadministered with fluticasone propionate. In a drug interaction study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in increased fluticasone propionate exposure and reduced plasma cortisol AUC, but on urinary excretion of cortisol. [see [DRUG INTERACTIONS](/ticlast-drug.htm#DI)] Clinical Studies Adults And Adolescents 12 Years Of Age And Older The efficacy and safety of DYMISTA in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older with seasonal allergic rhinitis was evaluated in 3 randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in 853 patients. The population of the trials was 12 to 78 years of age (64% female, 36% male; 80% white, 16% black, 2% Asian, 1% other). Patients were randomized to one of four treatment groups: one spray per nostril twice daily of DYMISTA, azelastine hydrochloride nasal spray, fluticasone propionate nasal The azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators use the same device and vehicle as DYMISTA and are not commercially marketed. Assessment of efficacy was based on the reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS), in addition to the instantaneous total nasal symptom score (iTNSS) and other supportive secondary efficacy variables. TNSS is calculated as the sum of the patients' scoring of the 4 individual nasal symptoms (rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sneezing, and nasal itching) on a 0 to 3 categorical severity scale (0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Patients were required to record symptom severity daily reflecting over the previous 12 hours (morning, AM, and evening, PM). For the primary efficacy endpoint, the combined AM+PM rTNSS (maximum score of 24) was assessed as a change from baseline for each day and then averaged over a 2-week treatment period. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM rTNSS over 2 weeks. The iTNSS was recorded immediately prior to the next dose. In these trials, DYMISTA demonstrated statistically significant greater decreases in rTNSS as compared to azelastine hydrochloride and to fluticasone propionate, as well as to placebo. The differences between the monotherapies and placebo also were statistically significant. Representative results from one of the trials are shown below (Table 3). Table 3. Mean Change from Baseline in Reflective Total Nasal Symptom Scores over 2 Weeks * in Adults and Children 12 years with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis |Baseline||Change from | Baseline |Difference From Dymista iTNSS for each day (Maximum Score =24) and averaged over the 14 day treatment period | Not commercially marketed |LS Mean, 95% CI, and p-value are obtained from the repeated-measures analysis of covariance model using observed data.| In these trials, DYMISTA also demonstrated statistically significant, greater decreases in iTNSS as compared to placebo, as did the azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate comparators. Representative results from one of the trials are shown below (Table 4). Table 4. Mean Change from Baseline in Instantaneous Total Nasal Symptom Scores over 2 Weeks * in Adults and Children 12 years with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis |Baseline||Change from | Baseline |Difference From Placebo| iTNSS for each day (Maximum Score =24) and averaged over the 14 day treatment period | Not commercially marketed |LS Mean, 95% CI, and p-value are obtained from the repeated-measures analysis of covariance model using observed data.| Onset of action, defined as the first timepoint at which DYMISTA was statistically superior to placebo in the mean change from baseline in iTNSS and which was sustained thereafter, was assessed in each of the three trials. Onset of action was observed as early as 30 minutes following the initial dose of DYMISTA. The subjective impact of seasonal allergic rhinitis on patient's health-related quality of life was evaluated by the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) (28 items in 7 domains (activities, sleep, non-nose/eye symptoms, practical problems, nasal symptoms, eye symptoms, and emotional) evaluated on a 7-point scale where 0=no impairment and 6=maximum impairment), which was administered to patients 18 years of age and older. An overall RQLQ score is calculated from the mean of all items in the instrument. A change from baseline of at least 0.5 points is considered a clinically meaningful improvement. In each of these trials, DYMISTA demonstrated a statistically significant greater decrease from baseline in the overall RQLQ than placebo, which ranged from -0.55 (95% -0.39) to -0.80 (95% CI -0.55). In these trials, the treatment differences between DYMISTA and the monotherapies were less than the minimum important difference of 0.5 points. Pediatric Patients 6-11 Years Of Age The efficacy and safety of DYMISTA was evaluated in one randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 304 children 6 to 11 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either one spray per nostril twice daily of DYMISTA or placebo (vehicle control) for 14 days. The design of the trial was similar to that of the adult trials. The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in combined AM+PM reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) over 2 weeks. DYMISTA was not statistically significantly different than placebo, but the results were numerically supportive (Table 5).

Special Populations DYMISTA was not studied in any special populations, and no gender-specific pharmacokinetic data have been obtained. Hepatic Impairment: Following oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by hepatic impairment. Renal Impairment: Based on oral, single-dose studies of azelastine hydrochloride, renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min) resulted in a 70-75% higher Cmax and AUC compared to healthy subjects. Time to maximum concentration was unchanged. Age: Following oral administration of azelastine hydrochloride, pharmacokinetic parameters were not influenced by age.

Drug-Drug Interactions No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with DYMISTA. The drug interactions of the combination are expected to reflect those of the individual components. Erythromycin: Coadministration of orally administered azelastine (4 mg twice daily) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 7 days) resulted in Cmax of 5.36 \u00b1 2.6 ng/mL and AUC of 49.7 \u00b1 24 ngh/mL for azelastine, whereas, administration of azelastine alone resulted in Cmax of 5.57 \u00b1 2.7 AUC 24 azelastine. In another drug study, coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (500 mcg twice daily) and erythromycin (333 mg three times daily) did not affect fluticasone propionate pharmacokinetics. Cimetidine and Ranitidine: In a multiple-dose, steady-state drug interaction trial in healthy subjects, cimetidine (400 mg twice daily) increased orally administered mean azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) concentrations by approximately 65%. Coadministration of orally administered azelastine hydrochloride (4 mg twice daily) with ranitidine hydrochloride (150 mg twice daily) resulted in Cmax whereas, in significant pharmacokinetic interaction was observed with the coadministration of an oral 4 mg dose of azelastine hydrochloride twice daily and theophylline 300 mg or 400 mg twice daily. Ritonavir: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction study in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations propionate undetectable ( < 10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (Cmax) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range, 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC(0-) averaged 8.43 pghr/mL (range, 4.2 to 18.8 Fluticasone propionate Cmax and increased spray. This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in plasma cortisol area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC).
