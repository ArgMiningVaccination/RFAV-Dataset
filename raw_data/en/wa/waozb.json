Below you will find information regarding UIW's COVID-19 response, safety guidelines and helpful resources for the UIW community. Updated May 26, 2023 Dear Cardinal Community, After nearly 3 years, the federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency declaration ended on May 11, 2023. The past few years have been challenging but much progress has been made that has created a safe environment where society can live with COVID-19 without significant disruptions. We now have COVID-19 vaccines, access to testing, and treatments that decrease and manage the risk of COVID-19. In our UIW community, we have safely been able to contain the spread of COVID-19 and effectively treat and care for those individuals who did become ill. Going forward, UIW will continue to offer support for employees and students through UIW services but will begin to scale down COVID-19 tracking efforts. Students, employees, and employee dependents will continue to have access to medical services that include vaccines, testing and treatment of COVID-19. Please call (210) 829-6017 to schedule an appointment. Students will continue to have access to counseling and support services through Behavioral Health. Appointments can be scheduled online. Illness Report Students and employees are no longer required to report their COVID-19 illness to the university. Students will notify their faculty and employees will notify their supervisor of any absences related to illnesses. You are still encouraged to stay home when you are sick and refrain from coming to campus if you test positive for COVID-19. Individuals exposed to COVID-19 may still come to campus but are encouraged to wear a facemask. Facemasks are not required on campus. UIW is committed to protecting our community from illness and will continue to invest in healthcare related resources to better serve our students, employees and friends. Please feel free to reach out to UIW Health Services for any health and wellness related questions. Thank you for all your work in keeping our community safe.
