Frequently, but incorrectly attributed to Mark T wain, this phrase describes \"the persuasive power of numbers, particularly the use of statistics to bolster weak arguments. It is also sometimes colloquially used to doubt statistics used to prove an opponent's point.\" In this era of BIG DA T A, with its concomitant use of \"inductive statistics and concepts from nonlinear system identification to infer laws (regressions, nonlinear relationships, and causal effects) from large sets of data with low information density to reveal relationships and dependencies, or to perform predictions of outcomes and behaviors\"2, we risk losing sight of the trees for the forest. In this year's Annual Report of the Research Division of the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Medicine, we summarize our research activities for the academic year (AY) 2018-2019. Although the number of faculty conducting research (8% increase), new studies opened (50% increase) and abstracts presented (12.8% increase) increased compared to AY 2017-2018, the other metrics decreased or were unchanged: grant applications (no change), grants funded (20% decrease) and publications (no change). From these data, one could easily infer that our research program productivity, the forest, stagnated. However , this statistical view of the forest obscures the individual effort, the trees, put forth by the faculty. For example, for each of the past three years, we've opened more new studies, with a greater percentage increase each year compared to the prior year (21%, 41%, and 50%, respectively). Furthermore, while the number of faculty conducting research has not appreciably increased, those faculty conducting research are, individually, conducting more studies. T aking into account the time it takes to conduct research, we've seen a concomitant increase in the number of abstracts presented. We anticipate an increase in the number of publications and grant applications as these projects mature. Michael Pearl, MD, FACOG, FACS Vice Chairman for Research and Faculty Development, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Medicine Professor and Gynecologic Oncology Disease Management T eam LeaderMessage from the Vice Chairman Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Medicine3As another example, the number of grant applications was unchanged and funded grants decreased 20%. Statistically, this section of the forest seems stagnant at best. However , Drs. J. Gerald Quirk (Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Medicine) and Petar Djuric (Electrical and Computer Engineering) were awarded an RO1 grant from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health & Human Development (NICHD), \"Rethinking Electronic Fetal Monitoring to Improve Perinatal Outcomes and Reduce Frequency of Operative Vaginal and Cesarean Deliveries\". In an era when the success rate for an RO1 or equivalent grant application remains approximately 20%,3 this is a noteworthy accomplishment requiring tremendous time and effort to achieve. According to their grant application, \"The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to fetal hypoxia and ischemia. Its established weaknesses include: 1) the obstetrician's highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns and 2) the widespread use of unproven surrogates for relevant fetal hypoxic and/or ischemic injury such as umbilical arterial pH, intrapartum stillbirth, newborn Apgar scores and neonatal seizures. This technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce 45 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 Facult y Conducting Resear chNew Studies OpenedGrant 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017SUC CESS RA TENIH Grants, Success RatesDivision of Research Annual Report | 2018-20194the numbers of infants with cerebral palsy. EFM as it is presently used in the clinical setting has been associated with an extraordinary increase in the use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. No functional algorithm has yet been developed that integrates clinical data collected in the antepartum period and during labor and any other patient specific data with the results of EFM. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of EFM data, especially under real world conditions and in real time where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in significantly decreased use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery while more precisely defining the fetus at risk for developing metabolic acidosis and long term neurologic injury.\" Their horizontal research collaboration will use BIG DA T A and involves diverse interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approaches to a core research project that has the potential to substantially impact obstetrical outcomes. It is \"conducive to collaborate because individuals from different cultures and with different belief systems think differently, and collaboration is likely to spur innovative ideas and solutions.\"4 With the consistent support of our Chairman, Dr . T odd Griffin, the clinical division directors, the Research Division staff led by Elizabeth Roemer , the faculty and staff of the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology & Reproductive Medicine, and our research collaborators, we had a productive and successful year . Statistics (the forest) may be misleading; often, it is necessary to critically assess the data (the trees) in order to clearly see the entire story. I look forward to an even more productive and successful year in 2019-2020. REFERENCES 1. Pearl discussing data with Dr . Wen- Tien Chen and his teamDepartment of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Medicine5Mission The Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Medicine recognizes the importance of research by our faculty members, residents and students. One of our core values, as part of the academic mission of the department, is to establish an atmosphere of respect and excitement for research. Our commitment to multidisciplinary team-based women's healthcare is a key component of our efforts to create and expand knowledge and improve the quality of our patients' lives through excellent basic, translational, and clinical research. The Department's mission to foster clinical investigation and translational research amongst the faculty is supported by an established and rapidly growing Division of Research. Critical to the success of our endeavor is the integration of the pillars of academic medicine: clinical care, education, and research. Excellence in one of these domains is always dependent upon success in the other two. T o this end, the Division of Research is dedicated to supporting our faculty members, residents and students in a variety of ways. A few of these, all part of an ever-expanding list, include: Aiding our investigators in developing their research interests Assisting researchers in the design and development of their projects Providing assistance with regulatory compliance Helping to identify and secure funding for research projects Providing mechanisms to find collaborators in other departments Creating opportunities to meet with other investigators to discuss common interests Fostering inter-departmental and inter-institutional collaborative research efforts Hosting regular research meetings for faculty and staff where projects can be discussed Highlights A number of important events impacted the Research Division this year . Key among them were: CORIHS approved 24 new Ob/Gyn projects and we currently have 52 projects approved and underway. Faculty, fellows and residents produced 24 peer-reviewed publications with an additional 7 in review, and 9 manuscripts in process; as well as 1 book chapter , and 44 meeting abstracts. Department faculty were co-inventors on 1 patent (granted) and 1 filed patent application. Department faculty submitted 15 funding applications, 8 as PI and 7 in collaboration with others. The department currently has PIs with 3 actively funded studies (not including 2 Cancer Center clinical trials). In addition, faculty are acting as mentors or co-Investigators on 1 study and 2 Cancer Center clinical trials.Research Division OverviewDivision of Research Annual Report | 2018-20196Staff Michael Pearl, MD | Vice Chairman for Research and Faculty Development Dr .
