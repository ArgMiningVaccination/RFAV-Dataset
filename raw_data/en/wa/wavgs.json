Have you ever said \"I feel like a train wreck\" or that you are an \"emotional basket case\"? Perhaps you are carrying around emotional baggage! There is a way to dump this baggage...just think of it as an attitude adjustment. The Emotion Code was developed by Dr. Bradley Nelson (no relation) who realized that his patients' aches and pains were more than physically based. He coined the phrase \"trapped emotions\" - negative energies that become trapped in the body during intense emotional events. These trapped emotions can cause pain, self-sabotage, emotional distress and all kinds of malfunction and disease. Do you have a Heart Wall? A 'heart wall' is literally a wall around the heart made of multiple layers of trapped emotional energy. The heart wall is a protective mechanism created by the subconscious mind to protect the heart from a grievous injury, and from being hurt again. Think of a heart wall like a bomb shelter - good to have when the bombs are falling, but if you live in it forever you may end up being disconnected and unfulfilled. Waking Up Happy at last! As a result of childhood traumas \"I was overwhelmed with fears, anxiety, and insecurities, and I drove these feelings deep inside so no one would ever notice. After decades of this behavior, my body couldn't take it any more. When I first came to Dr. Andy Nelson a few months ago, my body was screaming out in pain. I knew that my emotional pain and my physical pain were linked, but I never met a doctor who could deal with both. Not only did Dr. Andy and his team help me with the physical pain, but he also introduced me to Emotion Code. Dr. Andy is a very knowledgeable, kind, patient, and caring doctor, and I was quickly able to put my trust in his non-judgmental hands. Emotion Code has changed my life! As I began to slowly release my various trapped emotions, my physical pain was greatly diminished. For the first time in my life, I am very relaxed with adults, enjoy their company, and wake up happy every morning! Things that weighed me down in the past have disappeared, and I am finally finding joy in life!\" Maureen Prescott AZ Chiropractor | Dr Andy Nelson, D.C. | Wellness Specialist | Energy Healing | Emotion Code | Massage Therapy | Car Accidents | Pain Management | Chiropractic Care "}
