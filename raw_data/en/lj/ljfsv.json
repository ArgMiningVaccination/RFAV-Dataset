Whether your ideal date is just with yourself in a couple, in a throuple, or in a quad drop drop ball. Sorry, I just like I'm not a numbers person. Oh, good. Well, I'm Jules Gill-Peterson, and honestly, no matter how many people I'm dating at any given time, I'm always the center of attention. Alex Belser: Weird how that happens. Oh, I'm Christina Cauterucci. I'm a senior writer at Slate and currently recovering from a really sexy winter cold. This. Speaker 3: I'm Brian Lauter, a editor at Slate. And I just got over my fourth round of COVID, so. Oh, my. Speaker 4: God, Brian. Speaker 3: I fill you in on the winter bugs for sure. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Well, if it's not viruses, maybe love is in the air. This month, listeners, I feel like love is in the air or, I don't know, maybe I accidentally up my estrogen dosage. It's either that or I think it's that we're coming to you on the heels of St Valentine's Day herself. It's Frankenstein, and I wanted to turn our attention to some very queer questions about love. First, we'll talk about a new Spanish film that actually has a French title Petit Mal. Yes, like the famous type of seizure. This is a film that explores the intimate trauma and everyday feelings of three queer women in a throuple. And honestly, this film has everything you need for a reflection on modern queer love. Okay. There are at least three dogs. Alex Belser: Including five. There are five dogs. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Oh, my God. There's five dogs. Yeah. Sorry. I'm so homophobic I couldn't park. Well, one of them is a naughty dog and named Greta. There are Instagram stories fueling jealousy. There is utter confusion when three people are all calling each other by the same pet name. Amore. Without being clear who's ever being talked to. And, well, actually, I don't know if there even is an actual Throuples sex scene in the movie, but in any case, we should talk about all of that. Alex Belser: Mm hmm. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: And then we'll consider arguably the hardest kind of love that there is. I'm talking about coming to love or be at peace with. Speaker 5: Yourself. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Especially in the wake of great loss or pain. In recent years, we've seen huge growth in the application of psychedelic drugs as a treatment strategy for PTSD, depression, anxiety and more. And although psychedelics are becoming more popular with everyone, a lot of queer and trans people have our own pretty unique and often pre-existing relationships with some of these substances, both in a recreational and a therapeutic context. Or maybe in the interesting place where the line between those blurs a little. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: So we're really excited to be joined this month by Dr. Alex Belser, truly the leading researcher into queer people's relationship with psychedelics, who has decades of clinical and research experience specifically on what these drugs might offer and also get back from us queers in something even like a liberatory sense. So whether you've had plenty of psychedelic experience or maybe you're just Ketamine curious, you won't want to miss this fascinating conversation. And as always, we will share our pride, some provocations and our updates to a gay agenda. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: But first, Cristina, do we have anything from our thoughts and queries inbox? Alex Belser: We were so thrilled to have a whole bunch of responses to our drag episode. It warmed our cold little queer hearts. We loved hearing your voices, especially. We got a couple of great voice memos. I wish we had time to play them all. But here's a really sweet story that we received from a listener named Erin. Speaker 5: Hi. Outward podcast. I just wanted to call in as a parent and a theater scholar practitioner who has been taking my kids to drag Queen events really since before they were born. I was at the New York City boy last week, festival eight months pregnant with my son, and he has been going to drag shows since he was in utero. My daughter saw her first drag queen story hour when she was really little, and we even did virtual drag queen story hours during lockdown because she was just absolutely obsessed with drag queens. She's five years old now. And for her fourth birthday, I asked her what she wanted for her birthday and she said she wanted a drag queen. Speaker 5: So we actually hired a local drag queen to come and do a drag queen story hour at her fourth birthday. It was amazing. She came, she read, Julian is a mermaid. She sang Happy Birthday. She took pictures with some of the kids. All of the parents were thrilled. And, you know, she was tipped very well for posing for pictures with all of the kids and their families. And for a lot of the kids, it was their first ever exposure to a drag queen. And my daughter was just like, oh, I've been seeing drag queens forever. Her goal when she grows up is to be a purple drag queen. That has been her. Her big dream since she was about three was to be a purple drag queen. Alex Belser: Erin, thank you so much for that voice memo. Your kids sound so cool. If you have a thought or query for us and I'm pretty sure you do, you can always reach us at our podcast at Slate.com. You know, we especially love to hear your beautiful voices, so send us your voice memos if you're so inclined. And if not, a cute little email. We'll do. Speaker 3: All right. Now it is time, as always, for our monthly prides and provocations. This is a reminder, since we maybe have some new listeners in the New year prior to provocations are when we look at the community and either find ourselves proud of something and share that with the group or provoked by something. And the style of that quarter's infamous art show and the L word called Provocations. So, Jules, why don't you start us off this month? Are you proud or provoked? Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Well, I guess I'm provoked. There's some pride snuck in, So I'm provoked by the straights, I guess. Or by lot. Even the straights. Sorry. Sorry. Straights. I'm provoked by just the lazy phone it and low energy satanic panic over Sam Smith and Kim Harris's graphic performance of that apparently hit song Unholy. Like what? Alex Belser: Apparently, it's. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: I'm sorry, I don't like that song. It just like, musically, it does absolutely nothing for me. Maybe it's because I was not raised Christian. And so, you know, it's not like sexy for me. But like, I you know, I'm a perfectly real fan of, you know, Kim Petraeus and Sam Smith, you know, with certain asterisks overall. But anyways, you know, they have this moment at the Grammys and like, of course, you know, they shared a win and that was nice. But there was just like the usual lazy, lazy, lazy Ben SHAPIRO Matt Walsh types B like this as Satan. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: My, my, my, my, my. But it's like, as was pointed out by other people, Sam Smith is literally wearing a party city devil costume, like $2, like a honey, I'm sorry. I need more. If you're giving if you're going to come with satanic panic, like you really got to try a little bit harder. It's so boring and embarrassing to be like it's gross when queer people and trans people and non-binary people do things because they must really want to seduce our children from the devil. Like, wish it were so honey, it wasn't that avant garde a performance like it was perfect. I mean, again, I think there are better candidates for a satanic panic. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: No, really, I just think satanic panic is lazy and gross. And I don't know, there's just so much bound up in that. Like, I'm so tired, you know, just to be provoked by the gays for a moment. So tired of people's nonsense about how Sam Smith Lux dresses their body like absolutely everyone can sit down and shut up about that for a minute. Like, I just want to draw the little dotted line. Please don't have a gay satanic panic over a person's body. Okay? Let them be sexy and let them do their thing. And let's all just relax a little and figure out what's really worth. You know, having a moral panic over which is not us. Speaker 3: But do let them get better outfits. I like the party setting. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Sorry, it was not part incident industry. Speaker 3: If you're going to do that, you need to really summon your clothes from the halls of pandemonium. It sounds like it's come up from the ground and wrap around you. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Yeah, now. And it can be done. Like the SNL performance Sam Smith and Petrus did a few weeks earlier. It was great. Like gigantic, like, I don't know, vaginal gown and like, gave birth to Kim. Patrice That was great. I like that. Alex Belser: Yeah, Yeah. That was creative. Also, just as somebody who was raised Catholic and does have a passing familiarity with the Bible, I'm pretty sure when Satan appears, he's usually it's usually like insidious ways. Like he doesn't come out dressed in like horns and a tail with, like, flames behind him. It's like he's the, like, sly person try to convince you to betray somebody or do something wrong. Speaker 3: So this beautiful angel famously. Oh, yeah. Alex Belser: Yeah. Oh, my God. Oh, yeah. Who am I kidding? It is way better at this than I have. Speaker 3: Christina, what do you have? Alex Belser: I'm proud this month. It's a little bit of a shady pride, but it's pride nonetheless. So in late January, Lex, the erstwhile dating and hookup app for queer women and trans people underwent a redesign. And so it used to be like a really simple interface, sort of meant as an homage to queer personals ads from the pre-Internet days. You could like do a couple of things on it. You could link your Instagram account, you could react and respond to ads. That was kind of it. Alex Belser: Now, you know, it's more colorful. You can create a group chat, make a little bit more of an involved profile with some stuff about yourself, a photo, nothing too wild, but somebody found because we're kind of queers are notoriously good at Googling. Somebody found the website of the design firm that did the overhaul in the rebranding, and they featured blacks on the site as like a client case study. This is the way they described it. Lex. Came to us for a rebrand to help them move from being perceived as a queer space for romantic relationships towards a queer space for platonic relationships. Alex Belser: So understandably, a lot of queers were offended or taken aback or miffed that Lex would tell them to stop being so horny. And indeed, pretty much all the new promotional images for the app that show sample Lex posts are kind of hilariously not horny. For example, you bring binoculars to your queer birding group trans femme book lover from Portland seeking trans owned shops to host my book club Stone Butch Batty from Texas looking for a workout buddy to lift weights with with skis. Oh, why do you need your lifting, bro? To know that you're stone? It looks like it's a weird combination of sexual and not sexual. But you know what I am proud of? Lex. Despite all the backlash for recognizing what it is and what it has become and leaning into it. Alex Belser: You know, we did a segment on Lex a year or two ago sort of focused on how sad it was that due entirely to users and not the app makers, it had turned from a hub for like a sexy personals to a place where people vented about being lonely and depressed. Yeah, and I do know some people who have hooked up through Lex, but it just seems like our community has shown that if you want to make us a hookup app or a dating app, you can't let us post whatever we want because a small but vocal segment of us will use it to be a boner. Hill. Alex Belser: So yes, let's make it a place designed specifically for the people who are looking for queer friends and community because a lot of people are excited about and looking for that. And the app had been a place for people to post ads for like, Hey, this queer bike ride is happening or whatever. But also now it can really be what it wants to be, which is a place for people to post things like in These are real recent posts Sad and lonely, but also funny and interesting for anyone else. Ever have the kind of self-hatred where they are actually happy when internal anger begins manifesting in headaches and nosebleeds. Speaker 3: Oh, goodness. Alex Belser: Or the person who said I got hit by a car, I'm mostly fine. But if anyone wants to come over and kiss me until I feel better, I will accept that. So you know what? I hope those people have fun with their platonic app for sad times and everyone who wants to flirt and hook up can get on field or something and doesn't have to be reading posts like that in between the posts for people who want to get fist in the air. So proud. Proud of you Lex. Don't listen to the haters. You know what people were using it for and you get them following. Speaker 3: Following the customer. Yeah. Yeah, that makes sense for sure. Alex Belser: Brian, how do you feel this month? Speaker 3: I am proud. I'm proud specifically of the righteous fight that many in our community have waged successfully against the cutting of Drag Race down to a 60 minute episode. I don't know. I don't know if you followed this this year a little bit. Yeah. This outpouring of rage, queer rage. But when season 15 started this year in January, they cut it. They got each episode down from 90 minutes, which is what people have been used to, to 60, which really means 45, right, when you think about commercials. And this was to accommodate this is a sort of insult to injury if this is to accommodate this reality show called The Real Friends of WeHo, which was billed as a Real Housewives kind of reality show, just follows people around about their kind of influencer lives. But it is just the worst possible show. And we want to be gay. Alex Belser: It's about gay men. Speaker 3: It's about gay men in West Hollywood. Yeah, it's like, but it's just the emptiest. Like there's no, you know, oh, this shows are sort of vapid, quote unquote. But this is like, has no chemistry. They don't know each other. It's all completely manufacturers. It's horrible. I'm sure it's not going to be renewed if it's already not been canceled. So because people are mad about that and not about like the cutting of Drag Race down, which made it a really incoherent show. I watched a few episodes and the runway takes like 2 minutes. It's like everything's very rushed now. Everybody was writing to MTV, like complaining about this. There was a petition with like 34,000 signatures. Oh, my God, I think. Speaker 3: And so finally, the week that we're recording, it was announced that on March 10th, MTV will be returning Drag Race to its ninth Wow episodes. Now, this is great. You know, cheers for the people who like Drag Race. But part of it is that the real friends that we have is only going to be six episodes anyway. So it may maybe it's unclear if they were planning to. Do the 90 minute edit already or if they were going to keep it 60 and just after the show is over. Unclear. Doesn't matter. Amazing to see direct action in this square from the community against a corporation that was ruining our queer fun. And so I'm proud. Proud of us for standing up for that. I, like, don't even watch Drag Race so much anymore. But even so, like, congratulations to those people. Alex Belser: A 90 minute TV show seems so long to me. I've never actually seen Drag Race, but I guess maybe it's warranted. Speaker 3: It's warranted. And that doesn't include Untucked, which is the sort of after gossip show that happens when it is warranted because there are so many queens on it now and there are so many challenges. And, you know, if you don't have time to, like, appreciate the looks and and the artistry, it's it's a real bummer. So absolutely warranted. Alex Belser: Also, it kind of strikes me as funny that MTV was like, we only have a certain amount of time that we can put queers on the TV. So like, if we show it's taking up some, we need to take it away from the other gay show. Speaker 3: Yeah, yeah. It also says something interesting about representation right now we don't want apparently there's that kind of reality show we want to try. And I think that's there's something interesting there. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: So don't tell Todrick Hall. He'll write another handwritten note on Instagram where he has a breakdown in prose over several different reactions. Speaker 3: I didn't even want to get into that, but yeah, it's a lot. Alex Belser: So I was thinking back recently on our conversation about the movie Bro's and also Fire Island and what a queer romcom could look like when the conventions of rom coms always seem to centre on problems related to gender differences or monogamy. And both of those films that we talked about tried to make the rom com genre work with some degree of non-monogamy with, I would say, mixed results. Yeah, but it made me think about how much more there could be to say about queer non-monogamous relationships. If someone wanted to make more of, let's say, contemplative black and white drama about a specific, realistic and hot gay poly killer. Well, my prayers were answered kind of. Alex Belser: Petit Mal is a very sparse and quiet Spanish film with a French title about a queer throuple that's destabilised when one of the partners who turns out to be kind of the anchor of their life together leaves for a month long business trip. So actually, though, it's a movie about a throuple. For most of it, there's only two people. It's directed by Ruth Kodaly, who stars in the film alongside her two actual partners. So there are throuple in real life. And in the movie, we'll definitely talk about how that affects our viewing of the film. So Ruth plays Leah, the one who's gone for most of the film. It's in black and white when she's gone because they love her so much. It's like the life is drained out of their world when she's away and they live in this gorgeous house that is probably only possible because they're a triple income family benefits off the threat pool. Alex Belser: So the two other partners, Anto and Marty, feel alienated from one another at first. Then they kind of bond in Leo's absence. They deal with some jealousy together too. As we mentioned before, they have five dogs, I think three of which are naughty toxins, two or three. And they just kind of like mope around thinking about their lives together and missing their third person, creating their own little inside jokes. It screened at a bunch of festivals last year, and now it's available to rent on Amazon and Apple TV and wherever you rent your things. And the film, I would say, kind of takes as a given that this relationship is interesting and unique enough on its own as a threat that it warrants a film in which nothing really happens. And basically that just seeing three women onscreen, having these tiny little everyday interactions together and responses to each other is saying something and telling us some kind of new story. Speaker 4: I kind of think that it did. Alex Belser: I don't know. It's incredibly subtle and barely there. It might just justify itself because Throuples are just so underexplored in mainstream storytelling that I did find it pretty thought provoking and sweet. But I'm curious what you guys thought. Uh, Brian, let's start with you. Speaker 3: And maybe am I being privileged because I'm going to throw up? Oh. Alex Belser: Yeah. I'm going to tokenize you for a second. Speaker 3: That's fine. I had a really divided reaction to this movie. And on the one hand, I thought that it was a really lovely and like. I don't know if I want to say realist, but like authentic, maybe a portrait of what a relationship looks like. And by that I mean the little small ways in which people who are together speak to each other and funny voices and have all of these funny jokes and act really weird in a way that you always think would be embarrassing if anyone saw you doing it right. And that's why it's private inside of your relationship. Speaker 3: This is the first movie I can think of, at least in a long time, that really did that, that really like was well. And I'm sure that has to do with the people involved actually being in a relationship sort of felt like that energy was present. So as an act of representation of that, it felt good that I enjoy it. Speaker 3: I am not sure, though, to your point about, you know, that the throuple itself is serious enough to justify this treatment. I don't think it proves that. I found it increasingly tedious as it went on. Like there's even a line somewhere where they're like, because there's this this weird meta thing of someone in the movie is making a movie about the threat. It's like the promo in that way. And they're like, What's more original than our life? Like, you know, this is like the best possible thing we could be making a movie about. And I can't decide if it's radical for a throuple to be boring, maybe or not, but but I didn't find that it was like that fascinating. But that also raises the question of of if this is somewhat autobiographical, you know, it's weird to argue with with like memoir because it's just memoir. So we can put that on the table, too, is like an adult to write complaining about the story. Exactly. Because. Well, you. Alex Belser: Can because it's not. It has to justify itself as a piece of art and a narrative. And it's funny because that whole storyline is basically the only kind of thing that really happens in the film, is one of them is making this documentary and producers like Who would Never appear, keep saying like, it's not interesting enough, give us some conflict. Like give us something unique in there. Alex Belser: Yeah, As you say, it keeps saying like, well, what's more, what what can be more interesting than our life, which must be actually what producers said to Ruth Cordella about this film, because it's like I would give the same notes and, you know, I feel like we've watched a couple queer documentaries where somebody is making a film about like their own family or somebody close to them. And I don't think many people do that very well. And I think the film definitely suffered for its inability to like, realize that some that like whatever they wrote that was this hyper realist, you know, depiction of two of them alone in a house together was like going to say something interesting, like, Jules, what did you think? Speaker 5: Yeah, you know, that that was. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Really the question that emerged for me. I mean, like, like, I think this movie is very much giving European art film. Yeah. Like, let's just not talk a lot. And when we talk, it can be sort of poetic and kind of. Yeah. Alex Belser: And I wasn't sure whether the subtitles were just bad or whether they were actually speaking in such strange ways. I think they were speaking in. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Such a strange way about, you know, my, my, my Spanish, as you know, treads much more, you know, you know, Caribbean and North America to not, you know, from Spain. But yeah, from what I was picking up on idiomatically. But I think the question for me that the film raises, or rather the question I brought to the film is like, what is the what is the thing that the film is trying to say about what a threat is? Right? And I think that that's a question that still remains for me, more broadly speaking, about this film kind of pushed me to come back to like, you know, I've been in poly relationships, I've, you know, gone on dates where there's like three of us, you know, things like that. I don't think that could be really fine. There's lots of reasons I like it. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: But one thing I'm always trying to think about is like what is supposed to have changed from couple to throuple because like, the couple form to me is sure, there's this whole like heteronormative history of it in terms of gender, binary, blah blah, blah, blah, blah, blah blah. But to me, I always think about it in terms of class. The couple form is part of the way that, you know, sexuality gets privatized, that we understand our emotional lives and our domestic sphere as a kind of private refuge from the wear and tear of the public world. And that might be true historically, you know, for straight people. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: But for queer people, it's very class stratified. There's like interesting middle class, queer people get to have more conventional relationships, have homes that are private spheres, and have this kind of like, Hey, our love is sort of a refuge from homophobia or transphobia and like. Poorer, working class, queer and trans people don't have that. Their lives are more public, their homes are less private. And I think that the difference to me is like what those kinds of relationships look like when you don't have a beautiful rural house in the in the Spanish countryside. Alex Belser: They don't interact with the public at all. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Right. And which is an interesting choice. Right? Like, yeah, it is an interesting choice to say what? Because I kept be like, I'm so confused. Where are we? Where did that where did you know that? Alex Belser: Because I think they. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Live in. Alex Belser: Colombia. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: In Colombia. Alex Belser: They don't live in Spain in real life. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: You know, when I was watching the movie, I kept having to be like, okay, chill out. Chill, because I was like, this is such like middle class flight of fancy, like white girl shit where they're just like. Alex Belser: Making eggs. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Having a lot of dogs. And then one of me is. Speaker 5: Sad and the other one. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: And I was like, I don't understand who these people are. And it kept getting them confused. I never learned their names, which is like, whatever, but like, so. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: So I think for me there's this kind of question of like, is the film trying to tell me that there is something about being in a throuple that's different than being in a couple? Because I'm not sure. I think personally that that distinction is not fascinated. It just seems like you could have a couple with more people, right? And that might be nice and that might be a little bit challenging because it's just logistically more people or is it a film about like, just like, you know, how weird it is to be swallowed up in the domestic, you know, as as queer people, because it's actually kind of boring and mundane and not actually as dramatic as we might. Well, I don't know. I just kind of got lost somewhere in there. It's not a bad thing at all. And I thought it was kind of interesting to hang out with this film for that long, you know, on those questions for that long, since it doesn't really necessarily like arrive somewhere dramatic at the end. So maybe it was just trying to like, tell me, like just sit here and see what happens. But, but I was sort of like, yeah, I don't know. You know, it just didn't. Alex Belser: I. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Didn't spark that much for me. Alex Belser: But I feel like two things. One, I don't think the film. Is self-aware enough or the filmmaker talented enough to have this be like a commentary. However, I disagree with your feeling that it didn't say anything new about the way that Throuples are different from couples. It prompted thoughts in me. I won't say that it like showed me anything that would necessarily take take every person down this route. But for me, like the moments when the three of them were somehow interacting with life on the phone, which it was also about like the alien and alienating nature of technology, because there's constantly like technology lags and you can't hear what she's saying. And I'm like, okay, yeah, that's just about a long distance relationship. Speaker 3: The horror of people using Instagram on a desktop, which was like. Alex Belser: An Instagram story, was nowhere. Speaker 3: Near where. Alex Belser: They were premiering it. But it did. And, you know, I've never been in a throuple, although I have Throuples in my life. It helped me understand for the first time maybe, or consider what it might be like for, let's say, in this one moment when they're talking to lie on the phone and they're kind of mad because she stayed out really late the night before and didn't call them. They were worried about her. Anto gets kind of upset and I feel like that freed up Marty to not be as upset to have Anto kind of like occupy that space for her and for her to almost feel like a little bit of a mediator or have a more like muted or understanding action. And I was like, Oh, I could see this being a way in which Throuples differs from coupledom or the way in which like. Two people being able to bond over their love for a third person. Can sort of amplify those feelings. Alex Belser: Those moments gave me very subtle but thought provoking insight into what a throuple might be, because I do think it is different to have like not just individual relationships with two different people, but like a third wholly separate relationship between the three of you. Like, that is something that most people don't have experience with, that queer people for obvious reasons, because there are only like two binary genders in hetero and like obviously if there's a throuple, usually it's going to be queer in some way. Like we have a special understanding of what that might be like. So I appreciated it for that reason. Alex Belser: Brian What did you feel like you maybe wished or would have made it more interesting for you? Speaker 3: Again, I feel like this might be like a boring complaint, but I would have liked to have seen like, so the way the movie is structured, basically it's, it's very hard. So it's structured in a lot of different ways. But one of the main things is that there's a lot of flashbacks that are in color to when the couple is happy. Basically it's we to see them, you know, joking around, having sex a little bit, you know, just whatever, doing domestic things and laughing on trips together. On trips together. Yeah, exactly. All of that and all of the sort of present of the film is this crisis, which is really a stupid crisis, but like where this one of them has gone for a month and oh gosh, what's going to happen? Alex Belser: It's actually really funny when you put it that way. It's a little self-serving on Ruth's part to be like, Wow, when I left, like, their lives basically stopped. Speaker 3: It stopped? Yeah. And so I don't know. It's not that I want like, positive representation, but I just think that what's interesting about the Throuple is probably located in all of those flashbacks where you would see like a lot of what life looks like and in ways that maybe are different from the way. Although I take Jules's point to heart, I think, you know, when people ask me like about my relationship and how it's different, I really often just say it's really not. It's like we are a middle class, white gay man, Like there's three of us in this house instead of two. Like, it's it's really just not because of the reasons that Jules articulated. It's not that radical for us. Speaker 3: I don't know. I wish the movie had spent a little more time. And there's the color sequences so that we could understand what drew these people together and what what maybe was unique about them. Before we go into this very, I think, kind of fan. But also the crisis itself is, I think, the one that people looking from the outside and polyamory, I always expect that. Speaker 3: Yeah. Well you know really there's like jealousy is going to break it apart or only two of them like each other are like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's not, it's not possible actually for this to be stable. And I think the movie, you know, again, if it's autobiographical, I guess that's what it is. But like the movie seems to really lean in to just to this idea that like this is a fundamentally fraught relationship when I think it can actually be more stable than dyadic ones for various reasons. And so that's what I would say about. Alex Belser: Like for what reasons? Like a three legged stool. Speaker 3: Like a three legged tripod. A tripod is a very stable form. I well, you brought up a thing, right? Like so in conflict mitigation. Actually, it is absolutely a different experience in an argument to have a person who maybe isn't implicated in the argument and the same people are who can not be objective and you don't want to make anybody a therapist. I think that's a big mistake. But who can kind of maybe look at both sides of a disagreement and add context often and. Alex Belser: Also support both people. Speaker 3: And support both people or sometimes, you know, occasionally be like, No, actually, girl, you're wrong. Like, the two of us think that you were wrong about this. And that's also, you know, when I'm on the wrong side of that, I take it more seriously, I think, than you can sometimes in the one on one. There's so much ego involved, though, and it's like two people are like, Well, okay, the sample size here. Speaker 4: Is the thing. Speaker 3: That is different. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: I mean, I think you're totally right because Gina, like that scene, one of the most interesting scenes in the film is this one where, yeah, you know, liars been out late and I couldn't get a hold of her. I mean, I really do. I will say as someone who's in a long distance relationship and it was a really harrowing long distance relationship film, I kept being like, This is making me so. Speaker 3: So yeah. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: But yeah, the scene where they're, you know, trying to call her and they're like, What happened? His wife or I was out drunk. Why you two being so and. He and one of the two, you know, who are together, you know, leaves the car. And the other one where they had been talking to her runs off and. Alex Belser: Let's hear a clip from that scene. Speaker 4: And I've been asking Jones, I want to see. Gippsland. Not focusing. But you know what is allowed them to host channels. Traditional Australia Mubarak passport the applicant raises the minimum as I respond is to styles of yes they Dakotas is going to be in the seller's own solar energy was up was not no breeders are it a new imam. No energy at the moment. So, you know, I guess that properties don't go very well. You know, that's good to know. You have a good guy. Speaker 4: No, I'm of here. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: You know, there is something really interesting about those moments. And I think there's also it's not just like sort of negotiating insecurities and boundaries and all of that kind of, you know, complexities of being in a relationship. But there's also the then the positive versions of that. You know, I can think of times in my life where I really enjoyed being a part of, you know, more like, you know, poly cool in some regard because it gives you a chance, especially, you know, I was thinking in ways that those can cluster difference and it really like dramatizes the stakes that the person who we are in a relationship with is supposed to somehow address all of you and, you know, be attentive to everything that you want, that it's, you know, all the ways that that can become labor or expectation or pressure can that can really be dialed down. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: And then you can also take interesting forms of vicarious or intimate pleasure, right? Like there is that term compression, but like getting to watch someone else enjoy something about another person and enjoy that, you know, like there are moments like, I just think that there are parts of yourself you can explore in a situation where there are more roles to take on voluntarily and take off and there are more combinatorial possibilities. That all makes a lot of sense to me. And I think that that can provide, again, more stability. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: I think it can be really powerful, too, for relationships that involve forms of mentorship and care that are intentional and consensual. We see there intimacy. And it's so interesting to me that they really are in a relationship because obviously that comes through. Like, I'm convinced like there's real chemistry and that the sex is actually like, really well done. One of the longest sex scene in the film, which is just between two of them, I guess I was like, Oh, hey, like that is I'm really enjoying that. Like, yeah. Speaker 3: It was a. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Fantastic scene. It was really well done. But one thing I was just so curious about, I was like. Speaker 5: How did these people get together? Alex Belser: Like, okay, so yeah, this is like how I feel about why I still think it's really interesting to hear how every queer person has come out and come into themselves because we live in a world where that's not the norm. So it's like, how did you come to that conclusion? How did you meet people? Like, how did you find your friends? How did you meet your lovers? Now that there's apps, it's like a little bit less interesting. But the coming out story, I feel like there's a way in which that could that like every throuple kind of has that too because that's not the normative relationship form and same with poly people like in any relationship pattern and so like that would have been a really, really interesting and fun part of the film to make like because it's it also seems clear that Leah and Marty have been together for a longer period of time. So like, were they already poly when they met? And so like what? How did this come to be? I was like, Oh, I just want to know. Speaker 3: This is new. I mean, I think that it was very difficult for me to to figure out what the arrangement had been of the people had been before they, they became a throuple. And of course, that is one of the most interesting dynamics, right. Like, I mean, in my case, I was with my partner, I think it was eight years before we met just in my third. And so that obviously raises a host of questions about like how to how to how does a third person integrate into an existing relationship? How do really create a new relationship that is all of us together without trying to pretend like we can erase the before? Not possible. Like all of those things are really fascinating questions. And the movie. The movie doesn't only maybe it gestures at that slightly, like maybe not at all. Alex Belser: It was like at the very beginning in the in like the quickest way where you're like, what did they even say where it was basically like the two cut on people like and I was like, stop speaking Catalan or whatever. Speaker 3: Yeah. Alex Belser: Yeah. I'm like, we're like, Oh, okay. Like that could be an issue in this couple. But then the third person and. Yeah. Speaker 3: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Alex Belser: Okay, so maybe the film didn't answer all of my prayers, but it definitely showed me that I was praying for the right thing. Oh, I see more of this. But, you know, as we always say about queer representation, hopefully it'll open the door to more and better thoughtful films to come. Yeah. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Listeners need endorsement, like. It's hot. Alex Belser: I don't regret. But, you know, hour and a half I spent watching it. Speaker 3: I will respond so quickly. Okay. If you follow the news about drugs or even just drugs themselves, you probably know that in recent years, psychedelic substances like MDMA, psilocybin or magic mushrooms and ketamine have been taken up by mainstream clinical psychology as powerful tools for treating a range of mental health issues like depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and PTSD. Patients with previously intractable challenges have seen almost miraculous results through controlled therapy, with these recently criminalized and maligned medicines. Speaker 3: But where is the queer community? Which birth has a particular cultural history with psychedelics as well as an increased risk for a host of mental health concerns? In all of this, how do our unique experiences intersect with psychedelic therapy? And is the emerging discipline attending to us in all the ways that it should? To help us understand this rapidly evolving landscape. Speaker 3: We're joined today by Dr. Alex Belser. Alex is a psychedelic researcher and licensed psychologist, and he's been at the forefront of this clinical psychedelic movement for more than 20 years. He's been an investigator on a number of clinical trials of psilocybin and MDMA to treat depression, anxiety, substance use, OCD, PTSD and end of life distress. He is the founding president of Not the Sanctuary, which is the first nonprofit Center for Psychedelic Medicine on the East Coast. And he serves there under this great title, the chief clinical officer of Simon. And he is also a member of the Chicano Institutes for Women Gender Diversity and Sexual Minorities Working Group, where he works on issues affecting LGBTQ plus people. Alex is also, as of late last year, the co-editor and contributor to a groundbreaking anthology called Queering Psychedelics From Oppression to Liberation and Psychedelic Medicine. We're going to have him on the show for a long time now, and we're thrilled he could join us this month to take us on a trip, so to speak. Alex Belser: To this story. Speaker 3: Through this fascinating and complicated field. Alex, thank you for handling that tonight. And thank you so much for being here. Speaker 6: It's good to be here. Co-Chair TURNER Thank you for having me. Speaker 3: Yeah, we're really excited about this conversation. So so people can get a sense of who you are. And as a starting place, I'd love to hear a little bit about how you became interested in psychedelics professionally and then how that specific intersection with queer people became important to you. Yeah. Speaker 6: I was given a book called LSD Psychotherapy by a boy that I thought was really cute in my freshman year of college. And I, you know, in being a nerd, I thought I'd read this and it blew my mind. And then I kind of grew up in the nineties, gay queer East Coast rave scene where people were taking MDMA as matter of course, and not taking alcohol as quite as much. It was a different time. And we've moved into a different sort of queer usage pattern with ketamine and other drugs, maybe even in the last 25 years or so. Speaker 6: But so I was fascinated by psychedelics, and I had, you know, my own experiences. And then I started going to conferences and I started to realize, you know, this might be not only a thing, but I think I could make a career doing, which is working with medicines. I see a sacred medicines, therapeutic medicines like MDMA and psilocybin and DMT, and using them therapeutically to to work with people to foment reflection, transformation, change, and also to hold space for whatever may come. So so that's that's where we've been at. Speaker 6: You know, there's been a 50 year drug war since Nixon signed the Controlled Substances Act. Psychedelics were associated with black radicals and underground, you know, anti-war protesters. And we see some of that language being used still today. We've been expecting a backlash. But in the last 15 years, major universities from NYU and UCLA to Hopkins and Imperial have come forward with clinical results that are promising. I think that in the psychedelic community we're now at a place where we want to make clear that these are not panaceas and attend to not just the usage that's happening in, you know, really highly supported clinical trial settings, but the the iceberg of people that are using psychedelic drugs, medicines and all sorts of use rituals and contexts in both the straight and queer communities. Yeah. Speaker 3: Yeah. Speaker 3: One of the things that I learned that I really didn't know about from from reading some of the book and some of your other writings is that the history of psychedelic culture and sort of research has been extremely homophobic and transphobic. I wonder if you could just take us from our listeners briefly through that history and to where we are now? Speaker 6: Yeah, I was blown away by this. I had been going to psychedelic conferences for 15 years. I thought I knew more or less most of everything about psychedelic history. I mean, first of all, psychedelics were actually really common. In med school in the 1950s and sixties. You know, psychiatrists self-administered it as a way to help them understand their patient experiences better. There were thousands of people treated legally. The NIH funded psychiatric trials. This was like a normal psychiatric practice before it got shut down. And what was also part of that practice was leaders in the psychedelic community. We hear a lot about things like LSD being used by MKULTRA, the CIA, and they coercive ways as like a mind control. We we hear about psychedelic harms for sexual transgressions or abuses in the community. But no one told me, and I learned until recently about the history of LSD and psychedelics like mescaline and psilocybin being used as conversion therapy as well. Speaker 3: Right. Speaker 6: And not just not just as outliers or by a few sort of random people, but by like literally the Vanguard leadership. Timothy Leary said, quote, LSD is a specific cure for homosexuality. Dr. Richard Alfred at Harvard, who later became the renowned Ram Dass himself, talked about being attracted to men published to peer reviewed case reports where he treated gay men in order to make them straight, to have satisfying sexual relationships with their women partners. Speaker 6: Hollywood Hospital, which treated Cary Grant and was a leading psychiatric hospital, consistently did conversion therapy. There's accounts in the UK of a dozen lesbian and gay women being used using psilocybin in a hospital context to convert them. And there's terrifying, utterly terrifying accounts in France and in some other places of what are called sexual perverts and even young adolescents as young as 16 being administered very, extremely high doses of drugs like LSD. Speaker 6: Over and over and over again through the idea that was informed by this dynamic therapy and by this idea of shock therapy, that we would shock the ego, shock the psychological architecture of the individual, which was sick and gay, and which was still, according to the DSM, a diagnostic pathology. We would shock that, break that down, and then build it back up again in the you know, in the providers image of what would constitute a healthy, normal person. Speaker 6: And the harms are horrifying. And the worst part is that nobody talks about it. I mean, not even not even like psychedelic historians talk about it. It's sort of swept under the rug. And I'll just end by saying that would be okay to some extent if there weren't lineages today that replicate gender binary through it, like a male female diet in the room. If there weren't extraordinarily homophobic ayahuasca centers by leaders like shock, maybe to have like a homophobic theory about how AI Oscar can help you transcend your your sexual orientation. I mean, these things are replete in, you know, around the world. And I think in some ways in the clinic. Alex Belser: You said male female dyad. And I encountered that phrase, you know, in your book. Can you explain what that framework is and how it might affect, you know, queer trans people getting therapy? Speaker 6: Yeah, absolutely. So the idea in psychedelic work, in good psychedelic work, is that you do multiple sessions of preparation with the person who's going to take the medicine. You provide a good set and setting. There's a bond of trust and rapport and you work with two people, right? And there's a whole lineage of this. There's some evidence that the idea is that we wanted to add a second person to prevent sexual harm. Speaker 6: The other thing is it's an eight hour day, so people need to go to the bathroom or take a break or eat lunch. So so usually you're working with two therapists. And traditionally there's been this idea of a cisgender male female diet. Some of this may have been to prevent sexual harm, to have a woman in the room. And this is like literally some of the historical like argumentation. But I think largely it's been coming out of a sort of sacred idea, the sort of concept of sacred masculinity and sacred femininity. And it's sort of dynamic and analytic ideas of the mother transference and the father object in the room, and that there's a balance in the holding of that. Speaker 6: And of course, this is instantiates the gender binary. And there's been like an ongoing, vociferous discourse about it. And most organizations have moved towards a more gender neutral and patient focused pairing, right? Like if the individual has a history of sexual violence perpetrated by assistant or man, you may not pair them with two assistant or male therapists, for example. That might be meaningful considerations. Speaker 6: But but, but there's this this notion and some of it's like permeates the sort of permafrost of of the of the movement. And it's only really in the last few years that we even see that happening. And even bulletins that are being used in FDA trials right now say usually, quote, usually a man and a woman, which completely ignores trans and GNC non-binary experience. So it's. You know, we've made progress, but it's a it's a form of harm, including to other forms of harm, I'm sure you're all familiar with, which is like not asking for pronouns upon intake, not using preferred names to identify people when giving, you know, doing identification in the clinic or in the hospital. So, yeah, it's it's really frustrating. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Well, I'm curious like, you know, it's you know, so much of the intervention point here is about intentionality and understanding. You know, given this history of harm, particularly this history of conversion therapy, how these substances can be used very differently. Right. You know, one thing I really appreciate is that part of that intentionality is really kind of getting away from this, you know, maybe old school, but also very like, you know, a very kind of white guy belief that like the point of psychedelic experience is to transcend material difference, get out of your body, escape who you are, become some sort of whatever re enchanted. Everyone in the universe is the same whatever. Right. Which is just sort of like not that interesting for, you know, for queer people, trans people, people of color, you know, oppressed people like, yeah, now I'm not trying to, like, transcend who I am. Who I am is like, really where a lot of, you know, of the challenges I experience of the world stick. You know, they stick to that difference. And so and. Alex Belser: Also we're not all the. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Same. And we're also saying like, great, you know, I remember, you know, years before I transitioned, I used to be so afraid of psychedelics because, like, you know, like many people who don't want to deal with a certain elephant in the room, I was like, well, I don't want to you know, I don't want to experience ego death because I'm very concerned about what's underneath that, right? And all. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Yeah. And, and but, you know, it's interesting as someone who has subsequently, after transitioning, also thought different psychedelic therapies in a clinical context, I found that all of my fears were really misplaced, in part because I also had this really stereotypical idea of what you would be doing, that there would be this kind of like breaking down of the self. And I was like, Well, my self already feels so fragile and weak. Why would I want to break it down? And that's not at all right what's what's at stake. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: But I'm so sort of curious, like particularly for queer people, for trans people exploring gender and sexuality, but also dealing with the impact, say like, you know what, what we call like the minority stress model, you know, the kinds of wear and tear on the body and the psyche from experiencing structural, you know, discrimination or racism or, you know, inequity in the labor market or whatever. I mean, how how does that sort of how do we affirm it? How do you affirmatively go and explore those things? Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Sort of what is the process there that's actually about helping people build up who they are or explore who they are or enjoy who they are, rather than kind of like, you know, shoot a rocket into into something like I've done Ketamine therapy. The rocket has sailed sometimes in my recollection. But but, you know, I've just sort of cursed. It's a really a really common misunderstanding. And there's something really particularly powerful for LGBT folks about this particular like modalities. So would love to hear you tell us. Yeah. A little bit more about that. Speaker 6: One of the authors and Queering psychedelics are edited book writes about their experience as a person who's both queer and then also transitioning and trans. They talk about their experience in like an LGBTQ affirming psychotherapy that's also psychedelic affirming. And they said, you know, through psilocybin and integrating it, they, they, they came to realize that it was not me who was fucked up. It's the world that's and so the the possibility for a liberatory understanding of the self and the idea of like ego breaking the ego or like harming the ego or like dismantling the ego is, is complicated as to what that means. I think that actually I prefer ego, lytic, you know, ego. There's a some of the harsher, rigid ideas about who we are can become more imaginative, more liminal, more connected to one another, to space and time to the objects in the room. Speaker 6: I want to just go back to what you started with, which is this idea, I think, and I painted it with broad brushstrokes just to sort of caricature it. But there's this idea of with if you were to ask me, how do psychedelics help? Like why do they work in clinical studies? And one of the answers is that people have a mystical experience, a mystical experience questionnaire, and I give a talk on this. But the basic idea is that this is a questionnaire that's pulled out of the theology literature, and it's really focused on this idea of a transcendent experience, of the void of nothingness. It's sort of like the lone, isolated man person on the mountaintop. It's having an encounter, like not even beyond that, beyond the Godhead. It comes out of Christian mysticism and invite Vedanta. Speaker 6: And so the idea of spirituality and like where you're going. The latter. Spirituality is that all other experiences are marginal experience. So, you know, shamanic or natural mystical experience of the elements or of animals, of meetings with dead ancestors, of relational experiences, feminist ideas and queer theory ideas of experiencing the real in relationship in circle, rather than through transcending relationship notions of identity. That's like a deepening of one's identity rather than an escape from that identity. Speaker 6: And even spiritual or religious mystical ideas of playfulness and political action coming out of the plague years like all of that is informed by a sort of polymorphous queer spirituality that we see like time and time again. All of that is is kind of ignored. You know, it's like seen as like lesser if the vision has sound sight and tastes, it's like of a lesser quality, it needs to be beyond the body. Speaker 6: And so I think that the queer psychedelic experience in my research and talking with people is, is, is embodied. It is playful. It can be political. It can be it can have a critical this dialogue around systemic issues of power, like in the room and in one's lived experience. And that seems far richer. And I don't want to mysticism is not one it seems to be many. And and and those experiences are profound and beautiful and oftentimes terrifying and scary and need. We need to learn how to support one another in better ways. Mm hmm. Speaker 3: It's so interesting to hear you speak because you're bringing a lot of sort of community knowledge and experience and frameworks paradigms into what is clinical psychology, Right? Like, is there have you in I'm sure you have encountered resistance from the sort of science side of your work to including those things, because it's it's a bit surprising to hear some of the phrases that you're saying right now in that context. I wonder about the tension there. Speaker 6: Well, there's a huge tension in the production of knowledge and how yeah, how knowledge is funded and paid for. So most psychedelic studies to date have been funded through like charitable philanthropy, like wealthy people giving millions of dollars to fund it because up until last year the government wasn't funding anything. And even now they're only funding like a very limited set or from VC capital and sort of like corporate actors. Speaker 6: And that's all really about a particular epistemic domain, which is, you know, like let's create let's create a study that leads to symptom reduction. And I and as a psychologist, I love to see people's depression scores coming down and anxiety scores coming down, people remitting from years of PTSD, people in my trial with a team at Yale getting much better for their obsessional compulsive behaviors. Oh, that's wonderful, right? But it's really in a reductive medical model that tends to neuropsychopharmacology an outcome. And when you look at like, why that's happening, and in my research, I focused on interviewing people in depth. Right. What's going on? What did you see? What happened for you? What did you feel? What? Who was there? How do you make sense of what happened for you? Speaker 6: Those accounts of from patients in these trials are really, really varied. Like, not one thing happens. There's multiple arcs of healing and there's no money to really create knowledge. So the whole CBT evidence, base therapy, b P evidence based practice domain says, well, there's not really evidence to suggest that a psychological experience of like greater relationship is a mediator of outcome, of a place, of a playful, direct relation. Speaker 6: Reclamation of your body is a mediator of benefit because we actually don't formally study that, you know, and for the same, the same for sexual and gender diverse populations and bipoc and other, you know, social location populations in clinical research, which is that, you know, you're running a study with 30 people or 100 people and nobody you're not really except for a few minor exceptions, you're not designing trials that are LGBTQ, affirming from the get go of by and for design of, by and for like Java. Chang biases research at Yale queer folks. Speaker 6: And then if you have a hard enough time getting people in the door to recruit them into these trials and get them, you know, well, well, well through and then people aren't publishing. They're not collecting LGBTQ data at all, right? And then they're not reporting on it and subgroup analysis and meta analysis, which is just like statistical speak for saying, we don't know. Speaker 6: And this is a problem in medicine. Like traditional argument is that when studies were done with men, you know, first in man used to be first in men rather than first in human trials. We didn't know if there were adverse effects or if it worked as well for people who were not cisgender men. Right. The same is happening today, but with LGBTQ people because of sexual and gender minority stress processes and other racial minority stress. Processes and intersectional stress processes like we actually don't know. Like we know that these populations that our people endure as, as you said, higher rates and levels of stress and then internalized shame and internalized homophobia, for example. Speaker 6: And we think that psychedelics may be helpful. And in fact, some people are actually using psychedelics in like ketamine and affirming ways to to disinter that internalized shame and some harmful internal processes. But we we don't have the money and there's not systemic funding to it, like adequately funded to the standard that many people would be asking for yet. Alex Belser: Yeah. Alex Belser: I know this is a little bit possibly outside the realm of your research, but I did want to talk a little bit about psychedelics outside the clinical context. And we know that, you know, in queer party scenes and social circles, queers have often been like at the vanguard of like whatever the new trendy psychedelic is. We actually read a piece or Brian shared a piece with us from Rolling Stone called Does the Queer Scene Have a Ketamine problem about the proliferation of Ketamine in queer spaces, making it harder sometimes to identify when somebody is actually, you know, using ketamine and destructive ways and and downplaying this like side effects or symptoms of addiction. Alex Belser: And I'm wondering if, like, how you view, you know, as somebody who studies psychedelics in a clinical context, how do you view the the role that psychedelics have in queer party spaces? And and do you think people are using these drugs in similar ways in in therapeutic and sort of social circles or or do you see them as completely separate? Speaker 6: I'll just open by saying the most dangerous drugs are alcohol, tobacco, crystal meth and the opioid crisis. I mean, more people have died every year in the opioid crisis than died during the height of the HIV AIDS plague years for the last handful of years. This is including, of course, queer folks. That being said, you know, with alcohol, we have we have, as a culture developed risk mitigation, risk reduction, risk reduction, benefit maximization rituals, which is that, you know, not just the not just like seatbelts in designated driver things, but like when you're in college and somebody is really drunk, like people take care of that person generally. And there's also all sorts of, you know, communal wisdom about how much you should drink and not drink. And we we know about how much a glass of wine is. Speaker 6: I think there's a thousand ways in which we have mitigated harm from this extremely dangerous drug that is that is normative and dominant for ketamine and for psychedelic drugs generally. Like, Yes, I think that LGBTQ folks are kind of at the vanguard. I mean, they tend to have both higher uses of drug use, which can be positive and negative. But the way in which we as a community create rituals to minimize harm and maximize benefit kind of catch up over time. And we learn as we go along. Speaker 6: You know, one of the things is like ketamine is actually a wonder drug. It's on the World Health Organization's list of essential medicines. It's it was synthesized by Park Davis in the 1960s. It's still the most widely used human anesthetic in the world. All of the derogatory language about horse tranquilizer, that kind of thing is is drug war nonsense. It is used in veterinary medicine, but it's on every it's going to find it on every crash cart in ambulances in the United States. It's used in developing low and middle income countries. It's great because it doesn't depress unit for anesthesia, people's heart rate and and their ability to breathe. And so you can you know, people can administer it in the field. In Vietnam, there would be giving people syringes with ketamine so that they could get that person back and alive to the helicopter, to the to the hospital because it wasn't going to kill them, was actually relatively safe. Speaker 6: All that being said, and I think there are a lot of ways in which we can do do better. I mean, like the MDMA rave scene in the nineties that I grew up in, like there were rituals of some some better use, right? And even things like chill spaces, drug testing on site, you know, all of that is excellent today. People are still doing that. And I grew up with people thinking MDMA and dancing like a lot. And now when people say ketamine, there's they're dancing. But it looks totally different because, you know, and I know that they're having it seems like a beautiful experience inside, but they're not as agile right there. Speaker 3: Yeah. Speaker 6: If you take enough of it, you want to sit down or lie down and and actually that's when we use it therapeutically. This dreaded keyhole, for example, which is this idea that you've taken too much and then you're nonresponsive or sort of internal. You know, is actually pro therapeutic. I mean, many clinics intentionally give enough so that you're lying down in a beautiful setting with a supportive team with music, and your intention is to go inward. And the keyhole is actually where you you go inward, deep enough to to see something that's truly psychedelic and not just at a low dose level. Speaker 6: The problem in the community is that that happens in the hallway, right? So if somebody doesn't know what they're taking and we see this this issue of dosage efficacy with dangerous drugs like heroin, where like the amount that you take versus the lethal dose is quite the ratio, the therapeutic efficacy ratio is quite low. We see this with GHB, which is like people take too much ketamine, a little bit more forgiving here, thank goodness. And the vast majority of people take, I think, you know, take ketamine in ways that are fun, you know, recreationally and can be sacred or intentional. The risk for addictive potential does exist. And I think that, you know, as queer folks, as the LGBT community has a higher risk at baseline for problematic alcohol and substance use in order to compensate for all of the sexual and gender minority stressors that they're subjected to over the course of one's life. Speaker 6: So so ketamine oftentimes provides a reprieve. It is not nearly as addictive as nicotine or alcohol or opioids. And most people, the vast majority of people do just fine with occasional ketamine use without any habit forming potential. But some people do have habit forming potential, and that's where we can do better to take care of one another. Yeah. Speaker 3: I wonder if as a sort of place to to end, we could talk of you could give us just a little bit of a word about one of the overarching ideas of the book, which is that psychedelics and psychedelic treatment for queer people has a liberatory potential or a radical potential, not just this medicalized thing that we've been talking about, but actually something like angels are saying political like, like bigger than that. Just leave us with a little thought about what what you mean by that and what what are you looking forward to? Speaker 6: I don't know that we really fully comprehend the extent of. What psychedelics are, how they work, what they do, what the meaning of it is in our medical and our community and our queer cultures. Whether it's a retreat in Costa Rica or a party in Bushwick or, you know, our clinical trial at NYU and at Bellevue Hospital. We don't fully understand what is happening yet. Speaker 6: And as queer folks, I think that the idea that psychedelics would be used intentionally or constructed in social medical constructs to be to instantiate a dominant paradigm of power, like through conversion therapy, like ceramic, etc., or in more subtle ways, which is just like, let's just make people get better so they can go back to work and not, you know, have a collective care understanding of their entire ecosystem and lives. We need to work in a frame which is empowering, which is recognizing this the relationships that those people are in, in their homes and workplaces. Speaker 6: And so, you know, the word Queering harkens back to like less of an equality paradigm and more of a liberatory paradigm for a vision for how we own our own destinies and how we collectively empower one one another. And I think that the potential for psychedelics has yet to be fully explored. I mean, we're doing it in a conference called Queering Psychedelics. Coming up, if you're interested, read the book. But you know, honestly, like the book is unwritten and some of it's been long. So I'm excited to see where it goes. Speaker 3: That's a wonderful note to end on, Alex. Thank you so much for joining us today. I think you've given us and our listeners like a ton to think about. I just want to remind our listeners that the title of the book, if you want to check it out, is Queering Psychedelics From Oppression to Liberation and Psychedelic Medicine. Alex Is there somewhere that folks could sort of follow you to keep up with, with your work on social media or elsewhere? Speaker 6: Yeah, they can. My website Alex Belser dot com and I'm on, I'm on Facebook and Instagram and things like that. Yeah. Thank you. It's been so lovely to talk with you all. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Well, that's about it for this month. But before we go, we've got your monthly updates to the gay agenda. Christina, what gay agenda item do you have for us this month? Alex Belser: I think you should all watch Aftersun. It is a Scottish film by the trade cute and queer writer director Charlotte Wells. You don't need my recommendation to see it. It is one of the most highly acclaimed films of 2022. It's already won a bunch of awards, and I'm sure you'll hear about it soon if you haven't already. But I wanted to give special applause to the queerness of the film. Alex Belser: It's about a young father and his 11 year old girl. They're on vacation together at a kind of chintzy beach resort in Turkey. The gist of it is that it's this girl's memories. Like it's it's you know, this happened 20 years ago. It's her memories from her vacation with her dad who's divorced from her mom. It's clear he's having a hard time in his life. But it's it's filmed kind of from the child's perspective. So she just gets these little glimpses into his personal pain. Occasionally you see him when she does, and it's also about her on the verge of adolescence. She's really closely observing these older teens and the way they interact and kind of testing out who she might be and what attraction means and what she likes in other people. Alex Belser: It is such a subtle film that in contrast to the other film we talked about is just so says what it has to say so clearly and beautifully. And it just brought me right back to those moments of being a tween. When you're out in the world in a new place, surrounded by people who are kind of giving you different ideas of what your future might be and you're kind of imagining yourself into young adulthood. I don't want to ruin too much of what happens, but it's, you know, again, a very like lightly but clearly queer story and it's the first feature from Charlotte Wells by the way, who told the L.A. Times, My characters are always going to be queer by default. The stories I'm interested in telling are my experience in the world. So yeah. Good for her for making this incredible film. I cannot wait to see what she does next. And you guys are missing out if you don't watch it. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Well, Brian, what have you got for us? Speaker 3: I have a recommendation that is actually sort of tired or apropos to our chat with Alex. Dr. Alex Belser, I'm recommending that our listeners read up on Charles Silverstein, who just passed away at the age of 87. He was a psychologist, a writer and a gay activist pioneer. He was most famous for speaking out at the 1973 American Psychological Association meeting that ultimately led to homosexuality being classified as a mental disorder. He also collaborated with Edmund White on The Joy of Gay Sex in 1977, which is a book that explained how gay male intimacy works like a whole generation of people. Speaker 3: He was a founding editor of the Journal of Homosexuality. He wrote a lot about serving a psychological context about relationships between parents and gay children, about therapy with queer clients, other things like that. And he remained a really keen observer of society's relationship to queer people up until the end of his life. Speaker 3: I just wanted to read a quick thing from the New York Times op ed he wrote in his revised issue of his memoir that there are still religious groups that claim they can cure us. State legislatures often vote on bills to take away our rights. And make no mistake, most Americans would like to do just that. Most LGBT groups, he said, have become service oriented and have to keep their noses clean, an issue politics that has led to a listlessness and the LGBT movement. One wonders whether to call it a movement any longer or so tough. And I think. Right, correct where it's from, this, this, this pioneer. So if you didn't know about Charles Silverstein before, definitely go check him out. There's a lot of great obits and remembrances around. To to learn more. Speaker 3: Jules, what do you have? Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Yeah, well, so, you know, I know, actually, Valentine's Day is not like, you know, everyone's cup of tea and, you know, thankfully, there's perhaps a far more important thing that is February, which is it's Black History Month. You know, especially in this moment when certain governors with fascistic tendencies are gutting AP African-American studies. But that's not my suggestion. My suggestion is a book, not a book that came out now, but a book that might be a really fabulous Black History Month read for listeners. It's this idea Hartmann's book from a couple of years ago Wayward Lives, Beautiful experiments, intimate histories of social upheaval. You know, selfishly, it's on my mind because I'm teaching from it this semester. But it's just beautiful. It's just one of the most amazing books idea. Hartman is a scholar, but this is like a trade book that was written. And for everyone. So you do not have to be in my classroom to be to be reading it. This beautiful set of portraits of. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Yeah, of young black women and girls from sort of the late 19th, early 20th century period. You know, a time period where historians have basically just ignored black girls and women as social actors really assumed that their lives were just difficult, you know, kind of sad and put down. But it really underplayed the fascinating connections and spirit that they had. Hartman sees them as kind of rebellious people trying to claim and find ways in improvised forms of freedom under really difficult circumstances, not just a kind of height of white supremacist Jim Crow, but also just the tumult of living, you know, in segregated black neighborhoods in northern cities. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: And she really leans into relationships between women. You know, this is actually, you know, we often forget, especially the 1920s, thirties and forties are a high tide for for gay people. Like everybody is pretty gay. Those decades and, you know, young black women's relationships are this really fascinating portal to think about kind of the intimacy and just like vividness of history, like bring it to life. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: And she has this beautiful mode of narration where you're just kind of moving through these city spaces and like following these relationships that are amazing, you know, pictures of girls and love from the, you know, from the twenties of the thirties. It's really just a beautiful, stunning kind of tapestry, just an absolutely fabulous. But where you also get to really get a very different perspective on sort of a, you know, a black feminist and kind of black queer inflection for Black History Month. So, you know, it's been out for a while. Probably lots of listeners have heard of this. But if you haven't had the chance to pick up wayward lives, beautiful experiments, I highly recommend it. It's a it's a beautiful way to spend a little more of your February. Alex Belser: What a great recommendation. Speaker 3: I love. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: That. I always got books. I got books for days. Speaker 3: That. Alex Belser: Are smart one. Brian Lauter, Brian, Bryan Lowder, Christina Cauterucci, Erin, Jules Gill-Peterson, Brian Bryan: Well, sadly, this brings us to the end of our episode for this month.
