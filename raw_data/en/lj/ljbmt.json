Oslo: Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services, 2015. Norwegian Knowledge Centre for the Health Services summarizes and disseminates evidence concerning the effect of treatments, methods, and interventions in health services, in addition to monito ring health service quality. Our goal is to support good decision making in order to provide patients in Norway with the best possible care. The Knowledge Centre is organized under The Norwegian Directorate of Health, but is scientifically and profe ssionally independent. The Centre has no authority to develop health policy or responsibility to implement policies. We would like to thank all contributers for their expertise in this project.

For seri ous adverse events, we assessed the quality to be low or very low in most of our assessments. The analysis of cost-effectiveness was conducted using the maximum pharmacy retail prices, due to the fact that negotiated discounts are hidden from the general public as per contract between the Drug Procurement Cooperation system and the manufacturers. None of the interventions are cost-e ffective at the maximum pharmacy retail prices, and the budget impact if the interventions are accepted in clinical practice are substantial. Drug pr ice reductions in the region of 63 to 84 percent would be necessary to improve the cost-effectiveness and reduce the budget impact. 4 Executive summary Executive summary Background The Commissioners Forum, in the \"National system for the introduction of new health technologies within th e specialist health service\" has requested a health tech- nology assessment to compare effectivene ss and cost-effectiveness of the new drugs used for inoperable or metastatic malignant melanoma patients in the Norwegian setting. ipilimumab, nivoluma b, can be used as monotherapy or in combination with each other. The incidence of malignant melanoma in Norway is among the highest in the world with approximately 1,500 persons diagnosed annually. Objective To assess the effectiveness and cost-effe ctiveness of seven new drugs used for inoperable or metastatic malignant melanoma patients relative to each other in the Norwegian setting. Method In this health technology assessment, clinic al effectiveness was measured in terms of overall survival, progression free survival, he alth-related quality of life and serious adverse events. In the economic evaluation the primary endpoint was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with effectiveness measured in quality-adjusted life-years. Results were also presented in life years gained, in net health benefits, scatterplots, probability of being cost-effective and valu e of information analysis. We performed a systematic search for randomiz ed controlled trials in February 2015 in relevant bibliographic databases, Google Scholar and websites of selected health technology assessment agencies. We upda ted the search in September 2015. We contacted relevant pharmaceutical companies to obtain additional information. 5 Executive summary Two reviewers worked independently to iden tify relevant publications. One review author extracted data from the included re ferences and another review author veri- fied the data. We performed network meta-analyses where appropriate according to population, in- tervention, control and outcome. We ranked the different treatments in terms of their likelihood of leading to the best results for each endpoint. This we did by help of the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). The quality of the direct evidence, indire ct evidence, and the combined evidence from the network meta-analyses were eval uated by two review authors using the GRADE working group approach for network meta-analysis. Our cost-utility analysis were based on a probabilistic discrete-time Markov cohort model with three health states, progression free survival, progressed disease and death. We adjusted the baseline transition probabilities with the hazard ratios from the network meta-analysis. Clinicians in the field provid ed information relevant for the estimation of costs as we ll as modelling assumptions. Due to the fact that negotiated discounts are hidden from the general public, as per contract between the Drug Procurement C ooperation system and the manufacturers, the analysis of cost-effectiveness was cond ucted using the official maximum phar- macy retail prices. Results Our results are based upon 17 randomized controlled trials, presented in 40 publica- tions. Our conclusions for the relative co mparisons of effectiveness for the included drugs or combinations of drugs are based upon network meta-analyses using both direct and indirect evidence with dacarb azine as a common comparator. We ranked the different treatments in terms of their li kelihood of leading to the best results for each endpoint. The rankings were interpre ted cautiously taking into account the quality of the evidence. Our findings: For overall survival: Nivolumab and pembrolizumab in ipilim vemurafenib combined with cobimetinib, and dabrafenib combined with trametinib seemed to have a higher probability of good performanc e than the other available treatment strategies. We assessed the quality of the evidence to be moderate for nivolumab and vemurafenib combined wi th cobimetinib; low for nivolumab 6 Executive summary combined with ipilimumab , and dabrafenib combined with trametinib, and very low for pembrolizumab. For progression free survival: Dabrafenib combined with trametinib and vemurafenib combined with cobimetinib seem to have a higher probability of good performance than the other available treatment strategies. We assessed the quality of the evidence to be moderate in both cases. For health related quality of life: Due to insufficient data we did not perform a network meta-analysis for health related quality of life. Evidence from pairwise for four comparisons reported be tter health related quality of life in the intervention groups. For serious adverse events : We could not establish any differences between the available treatment strategies. However, the ranking suggests that pembrolizumab and nivolumab have a higher probability of fewer serious adverse events than the other available treatment strategies.We assessed the quality of the evidence to be low in both cases. We assessed the quality of the evidence for overall survival and progression free survival from the network meta-analy ses to be moderate or high for the majority of our comparisons. For seri ous adverse events, we assessed the quality to be low or very low in most of our assessments. The economic model predicted a median survival of about 12.5 months for ipilimumab and about 19 months for nivolumab, pembrolizumab and the combination nivolumab and ipilimum ab. The median survival for the BRAF/MEK inhibitors dabrafenib, vemurafenib and trametinib in monotherapy was about 11 months, and fo r the combinations dabrafenib and trametinib as well as vemurefanib and cobimetinib, 17.5 months. In comparison, the median survival of dacarbazine was 9 months. None of the interventions were cost -effective at the maximum pharmacy retail prices. The ranking of the interventions and the budget impacts may however change as a result of price changes. The first analysis included all the interventions from the network meta- analysis . Nivolumab had an incremental effect of 0.82 quality adjusted life years and an incremental cost-effectiv eness ratio against dacarbazine of about NOK 1.1 million per quality adjusted life year gained. The combination vemurafenib and cobimetinib had an incremental effectiveness of 0.07 quality adjusted life years and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of about NOK 19.8 million per quality adjusted life year gained against nivolumab. When we restricted the analysis to the BRAF and MEK inhibitors, dabrafenib had an incremental effect of 0.36 quality adjusted life years and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared to dacarbazine of approximately NOK 2.2 million per quality adjusted life year gained. The combination vemurafenib and cobimetinib had an incremental effect of 0.53 quality adjusted life years and increm ental cost-effectiveness ratio compared to dabrafenib of about NOK 2.9 million per quality adjusted life year gained. 7 Executive summary The BRAF and MEK inhibitor monother apies (dabrafenib, vemurafenib, trametinib) all had very similar costs an d effectiveness. The same applied to the BRAF/MEK combinations (dabrafenib and trametinib or vemurafenib and cobimetinib), but at a higher level of costs and effectiveness. When the analysis was limi ted to the immunotherapies , nivolumab in clearly sepa pembrolizumab in monotherapy, which had similar effect iveness and costs. The combination nivolumab and ipilimumab had about th e same level of effectiveness as nivolumab and pembrolizumab in monoth erapy, but at a higher level of costs. The expected value of partial perfect information analysis identified the efficacy data used in the model as th e dominating source of uncertainty, followed by the health related quality of life data, costs and serious adverse events. The maximum pharmacy retail prices would have to be reduced by approximately 79 percent for dabrafenib, 83 percent for the combination dabrafenib and trametinib, 81 percent for vemurafenib, 84 percent for the combination vemurafenib and cobimetini b, 83 percent for trametinib, 75 percent for ipilimumab, 63 percent for nivolumab, 76 percent for the combination nivolumab and ipilimumab , and 64 percent for pembrolizumab in order to achieve incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of NOK 500.000 per quality adjusted life year gained against dacarbazine. If the prices for the new interventions were reduced by 63 to 84 percent (depending on intervention) from the maximum pharmacy retail prices, the annual budgetary savings could be about NOK 277 million and the accumulated budgetary savi ngs over a 5 year period NOK 1,387 million. Discussion We found only two head to head co mparison for the included drugs as monotherapies, and five direct compar isons of combination treatment versus monotherapy. None of the included trials compared a BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib or vemurafenib) head to head with a drug acting on the immune system. The best available comparisons are the indirect evidences via dacarbazine as a common comparator. All the interventions could be included in the network meta-analyses for overall survival, progression free surv ival and serious adverse events. Of the endpoints studied, we consider overall survival to be of higher importance than progression free survival, since progression free survival is a surrogate endpoint. Health related quality of life and serious adverse events are of importance for the patients. However, from the available literatu re we were not able to find data usable for our network meta-analysis for health rela ted quality of life, and the quality of the evidence for serious adverse events were lo w or very low in most of our assessments. 8 Executive summary We only included randomized controlled trials. Our endpoints were all well-defined and harmonized in their definitions across the trials. Based on a qualitative assessment, the resu lts of the pairwise estimates and network meta-analyses are consistent. The number of avaliable interventions for patients with advanced malignant mela- noma is evolving rapidly at the moment. Ma ny of the interventions in this health technology assessment have just reached marketing authorization in Norway, and the available evidence from randomized controlled trials is quite limited. Hence, the clinical efficacy data in our report have the uncertainty that the majority of the evi- dence for the included comparisons were based upon a single study. It cannot be ruled out that new evidence from randomized controlled trials have the potential to change the ranking of the interventions both with regards to effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. We believe that the economic model distingu ished the interventions fairly well with regards to costs and overall survival, but no t so well with regards to health related quality of life, which is a crucial input fo r life prolonging interventions. This em- phazises the need to make separate judgme nts and not relying on the cost-effective- ness evidence alone. We are extrapolating effectiveness data beyond the clinical trial follow-up period for nivolumab, pembrolizumab, unce rtainty with regards to the correct treat- ment duration, both for the new immuno therapies and the BRAF and MEK inhibi- tors. Also, the results are dependent on that the treatment effects are the same across the three incremental cost-effectiveness analyses. To our knowledge a relative comparison fo r the different new drugs used for inoper- able or metastatic malignant melanoma patients has not been done by any others, neither for effectiveness nor for cost-effectiveness. Conclusion All conclusions are given with respect to the current state of the evidence and with the reservation that new evidence from randomized controlled trials can change the ranking of the interventions both with rega rds to effectiveness and cost-effectiveness (one of the interventions still do not have marketing authorization). None of the interventions are cost-effective at the maximum pharmacy retail prices. The budgetary impact of accepting some or all of the new interventions in clinical practice can be substantial, potentially diverting resources away from other inter- ventions or treatment areas with better cost-effectiveness. The budgetary impact and 9 Executive summary incremental cost-effectiveness ratios can however be reduced through price reduc- tions. We believe that drug price reductions in the region of 63 to 84 percent, de- pending on drug, would be necessary for the interventions to represent cost-effective use of resources in the Norwegian setting. We find it difficult to separate the ne w PD-1 immunotherapies nivolumab and pem- brolizumab with respect If the new immunotheraphies in mon- otherapy are accepted in cl inical practice, we expect increased effectiveness com- pared to ipilimumab in mono therapy, but at an increased cost. The potential budget- ary savings with price reductions from the maximum pharmacy retail price may be as high as NOK 131 million per year acro ss the immunotherapies, if a cost-effective- ness level of NOK 500,000 per gained quality adjusted life year is assumed. Based on the cost-effectiveness results, we cannot argue that any of the BRAF or MEK inhibitor monotherapies (dabrafenib, ve murafenib, trametinib), another, or that any BRAF/MEK combination (dabrafenib and tramet-inib or vemurafenib and cobimetinib), shou ld be preferred over another. However, the combination therapies are more likely to give the highest quality adjusted life year gains in the long run, at an increa sed cost. For the BRAF/MEK inhibitors, the potential budgetary savings with price reduct ions may be as high as NOK 147 million year. 10 Hovedfunn er en av de h\u00f8yeste i verden, inkluderte konklusjoner for rangeringen der vi har om lag 19 overlevelse BR prosent for kombinasjonen nivolumab og ipilimumab, og skal i st\u00f8rrelsesorden 63 til 84 prosent er n\u00f8dvendige for at de nye legemidlene skal curve.

These cancerous growths develop when unrepaired DNA damage to skin cells (most often caused by ultraviolet radiation from sunshine or tanni ng beds) triggers mutations (genetic de- fects) that lead the skin cells to multip ly rapidly and form malignant tumors. These tumors originate in the pigment-producing melanocytes in the basal layer of the epi- dermis (2). Malignant melanoma or melanoma are terms that are used interchange-ably (1). Malignant melanoma is divided into four stages, where stage I is the least severe and stage IV the most severe. Stage III includes locally advanced (inoperable, regional disease), and stage IV includes di stant metastasis (3, 4). The incidence of malignant melanoma in Norway is among the highest in the world (5) with 1,719 new cases in 2013 (6). Malignant melanoma is the cancer type that increases most in Norway (1). For persons aged between 15 and 49 years, this is the second most fre- quent cancer type for both sexes together (7). A family history of malignant mela- noma may be present in 5-10% of the melanoma cases (3). Treatment and prognosis Surgery is the primary treatment for mali gnant melanoma and currently also the only potentially curative treatment (5). Early diagnosis and appropriate surgical treatment cures 80-90% of patients, while 10-20% experience a relapse as local/re-gional recurrence or distant spreading (5). Patients with metastatic malignant melanoma have poor prognosis (7). The 5-year relative survival rate for distant melanoma (stage IV) for the period 2009-2013 was 12.3% for men and 24.5% for women (6). For selected patients with one single me- tastasis, surgery can be useful as the initial treatment (7). In cases with successful re- moval of all known metastases, the 5-year survival rate can improve to nearly 40% (7). When it is not possible to remove all metastatic tissue, the treatment will be pal- liative, and a 5-years survival of 7% has been shown (7). Radiation may provide good palliation and local control of inoperable metastases (7). 26 Background Drug treatment for patients with inoper able and/or metastatic malignant mela- noma Chemotherapy, as dacarbazine, has been th e standard drug treatment for most pa- tients (5). However, such chemotherapy has low response rates and has not been demonstrated to be life-extending (5). Recently, new drugs, that are not cytostatic, have been under development for the treatment of malignant melanoma. As a result of the clinical experiences with these new drugs, the drug treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma has changed in the last 2-3 years (5, 7). The Norwegian guidelines for malignant melanoma (7) gives preliminary recom- mendations for drug treatment for stage IV and inoperable stage III patients. The guidelines recommends a revision when new evidence on clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness is available. This health technology assessment can serve as input for such a revision. In this health technology assessment we have assessed seven new drugs relative to each other. We included the three new drugs that already had marketing authoriza- tion in Norway at the time when this he alth technology assessment was requested, ipilimumab, dabrafenib and vemurafenib. All three are indicated for treatment of advanced/metastatic melanoma. Dabrafenib and vemurafenib are only indicated for population of melanoma patien ts carrying BRAF V600 mutations (8). Fur- ther, we include the following drugs that did not have marketing authorization in Norway at the time of the request: cobimetinib, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab (af-ter request from RHA forum) and trametinib (on Norwegian Medicines Agency's list of requested rapid assessments). However, at the time of finalizing this report, all the drugs, except cobimetinib, had marketing authorization in Norway. The new drugs have different mechanism of action: 1) affect the immune system (ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab) (inhibit mitogen-activa ted protein kinase pa thway) (cobimetinib and trametinib) (12, 13). The drugs acting on the immune system do so by blocking mechanisms that limit ac- tivating of T cells. Activated T cells can be limited by 4 (CTLA-4) (cytotoxic T-lym- phocyte-associated protein), a co-inhibitor y molecule of the immune system; and by programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) with it s ligands PD-L1 and PDL2, which is ex- pressed in peripheral tissues and cancers (9 ). Ipilimumab acts by blocking 4 (CTLA- 4), whereas nivolumab and pembrolizumab bl ock the interaction of the PD-1 recep- tor with its two ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2 (9, 14). Forty to fifty percent of the patients with metastatic malignant melanoma have kinase B-RAF (BRAF) (7). This knowledge has led to the development of the drugs, dabrafenib and vemurafenib, 27 Background that are BRAF inhibitors. The of a MEK to- gether with a BRAF th e resistance seen to single agent BRAF inbibitors (15). The MEK inhibitors, are however, also used as single therapies. The Norwegian Medicines Agency (NMA), Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technol- ogies in Health (CADTH), an d National Institute for Heal th and Clinical Excellence (NICE), have performed single technology assessments on drugs used for metastatic melanoma, such as dabrafen ib (16, 17), ipilimumab (18 -21), trametinib (22) and vemurafenib (23, 24). However, none of these assessments compared the different new drugs for inoperable or metastatic malignant melanoma patients relatively to each other. We have therefore conducted th is health technology assessment for the new drugs for these patients in a Norwegian setting. Introduction to systematic revi ews of clinical effectiveness Systematic reviews of clinical effectiveness are products of a comprehensive process, including: literature search, study selection, risk of bias evaluations, data extraction, combining findings and qualit y of evidence evaluations. Based on predefined research questions, an information specialist develops a search strategy to identify relevant publications in electronic databases for medical re-search. In addition, the literature search may include reviews of reference lists, con- tacting field experts and searching for unpubl ished studies. The aim is to identify all relevant literature and include trials base d on predefined inclus ion criteria, specify- ing relevant populations, interventions, comparisons, outcomes and study design. To reduce bias, two reviewers assess abstract s and potentially relevant full text pub- lications independently for inclusion. The two reviewers also check that data from included studies are extracted correctly. Further it is usual for systematic review to evaluate the included trials for risk of bias or quality. This information may be used in addition to similarity in participants, in- terventions, comparisons and endpoints, in the decision as to whether effect esti- mates from several trials can be combined statistically in a meta-analysis. The risk of bias or quality should be used along the e ffect estimates when a conclusion is made in a systematic review. Introduction to Economic Evaluations of Health Care Pro- grammes The basic task of any economic evaluation is to identify, measure, value and com-pare costs and consequences of the alternatives being considered in an incremental analysis which means that the difference in co st is compared with the differences in consequences (25). Hence, results of econ omic evaluations can be expressed as an 28 Background incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is defined by the following equa- tion: EC Effect EffectCost CostICER comparator on interventicomparator on interventi Because the health care sector, as the societ y in general, is rest ricted by scarce re- sources and budget constraints, economic evaluations are tools for decision makers facing questions of how to prioritize and maximize benefits from scarce resources. For an economic evaluation to be meanin gful in a decision making process, the ICER must be judged with regards to a ceil ing ratio that reflects the decision maker's maximum willingness to pay (WTP) for a health gain. The decision rule for an eco- nomic evaluation can therefore be expressed as: EC where equals WTP, and means that if the ICER of an intervention is below the ceil- ing ratio, introducing the intervention repr esents good value for money. Because the ICER have poor statistical properties, ICERs are often rearranged to express either net monetary benefit (NMB) or net health benefit (NHB), which yields the following decision rules related to NMB or NHB. 0 : C E NMB 0 : CE NHB An intervention can in other words be consid ered cost-effective if it yields a positive NHB or NMB. Economic evaluations are often based on de cision models (such as decision trees, Markov models etc) that calculate results based on various inpu t parameters in the model. There are always uncertainties related to the values of these parameters, making sensitivity analyses an important feature of any economic evaluation that uses decision models as its framework. In short, sensitivity anal ysis illustrates how much the results vary when model parameters are being changed. Sensitivity anal- yses can be performed in many ways, with one-way or two-way sensitivity analysis being common approaches. This represents changing, respectively one or two model-parameters at a time while all the other model-parameters are held constant, to see how much impact the variation in these parameters has on the results. One- way sensitivity analyses are often presented as tornado-diagrams, which identify and illustrate the model-parameters that ha ve the highest impact on the results. Another important kind of sens itivity analysis is referred to as probabilistic sensitiv- ity analysis (PSA). The advantage of PSA is that it makes it possible to take the un- certainties of all the model-parameters into account at the same time. The basic ap- 29 Background proach in PSA is to assign appropriate pr obability distributions to the model-param- eters, which makes it possible to replace the \"fixed\" values of the parameters by val- ues generated by random draws from the dist ributions. Doing this repeatedly, with a definite number of iterations, makes it po ssible to estimate probabilities of alterna- tives being cost-effective subject to different ceiling values of WTP. The calculation is based on the alternative that renders the highest values of NMB or NHB. PSA is of- ten presented as scatterplots, which show point estimates of the ICER for all itera-tions in the cost-effectiveness plane, and also by cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs), that show the probabilit y of the alternatives being cost-effective subject to changing values of WTP. Another result from PSA is expected value of perfect information (EVPI). This is a number which says what value it would be fo r the society to have more accurate in- formation about the decision, given a WTP. If EVPI for a given population seems large, it might be of interest to find out which parameters it would be most useful to get new and improved data on. Expected va lue of perfect information for parameters is a more time-consuming operation which can give information on which single pa- rameters or groups of parameters it is most cost-effective to conduct new research on. In short, making a model prob abilistic, means that it is possible to estimate the un- certainty in the decision of implementing alternative interventions, and also pro- vides a possibility of estimati ng the value of collecting additional information from new research. Priority setting criteria According to Norwegian policy documents (\" prioriteringsforskriften\") (26), a treat- ment should be prioritised if th e following criteria are met: 1. The disease is severe; A disease is considered severe to the degree that it causes pain and discomfort, loss of physical, psyc hological and social function and if it limits the individual in his or her daily activities. Severity is also evaluated according to the risk increase the disease entails in terms of death, disability and discomfort, if treatment is postponed. 2. The treatment is effective; the patient should be expected to benefit from treatment, for instance in terms of survival or improved quality of life of certain duration. The treatment effectiveness should also be well documented. 3. The treatment is cost-effective; the added costs of the treatment should be reasonable compared to the added benefits. 30 Background There is no academic or political consensus regarding what constitutes a reasonable relationship between costs and effectivene ss in Norway. For this reason, we use a range of potential willingne ss-to-pay (WTP) values throug hout our report, but with NOK 500,000 per quality adjusted life year gained as input in some of the price sce-narios and budget impact analyses. For a de cision maker which has to prioritise be- tween interventions within a fixed budget, even NOK 500,000 per quality adjusted life year gained may be too high if the aver age cost per quality adjusted life year in the Norwegian health sector is lower. Generally, the risk of displacing interventions with a lower cost per quality adjusted life year, and a net health loss due to imple- mentation of new interventions, increase when the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are very high. 31 Clinical evaluation - Methods Clinical evaluation - Methods We have performed a Health Technology Assessment consisting of a systematic re- view of effectiveness and a health economic evaluation. We have performed the health technology assessment in accordan ce with the handbook from the Norwegian Knowledge Centre (27). Literature search In cooperation with a research libraria n, the project group developed search strategies that combined selected index terms and free text terms. We provide the complete search strategy in Appendix 1. A methodology search filter was used to limit retrieval to randomized controlled trials. The search filter consisted of a combination of randomized controlled trial.pt. (publication type), randomized controlled trial (MeSH), and relevant text words. We excluded trials of animals or animal experiments. We limited the search to trials published in year 2000 to 20 15 since the interventional drugs have entered the market recently and we do not expect to find relevant trials published before 2000. No language restrictions were applied during the literature search, but we only included trials written in English or in any of the Scandinavian languages. We performed a systematic search for literature 12-16 th of February 2015 in the fol- lowing databases: Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations and Ovid MEDLINE(R) version 1946 to Present Embase version 1974 to present Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Central) Web of Science PubMed (epub ahead of print) We also searched Google Scholar. These searches were updated 25 th of September 2015. The websites of selected health technology assessment agencies were searched 32 Clinical evaluation - Methods 9th of September 2015. We contacted the pharmaceutical companies that have mar- keting authorization or represent the interv entional drugs to obtain additional infor- mation as published articles, abstracts/po sters that fulfil ou r inclusion criteria. We also checked for randomized controlled tr ials in the relevant systematic reviews, reviews or meta-analyses which we identified. We looked for ongoing trials in ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) 18th of August 2015 . Inclusion criteria Population : Patients with inope rable or metastatic malignant melanoma aged 18 or older. Interventions: Cobimetinib D a b r a f e n i b Ipilimumab Nivolumab Pembrolizumab Trametinib Vemurafenib The above interventions given as monotherapy (including add-on) or in combination with each other Control: Any drug treatment or placebo Endpoints : Overall survival (or time to death) Progression free survival (PFS, Time To Progression etc.) Health related quality of life (measured with EQ-5D, SF-6D or disease specific instrument such as FACT-M, EORTC QLQ- C30) Serious adverse events Study design : Randomized controlled trials Languages : No language restrictions were applied during the literature search, but we only included tria ls written in English or any of the Scandinavian languages 33 Clinical evaluation - Methods Selection of articles The review authors worked independently and in pairs and reviewed all citations generated by the search to identify potent ially relevant publications based on title and/or abstract. We retrieved full text arti cles of all potentially relevant references and worked independently and in pairs to assess whether these references should be included according to the inclusion criter ia. We resolved disagreements by discus- sion. Assessment of methodological quality We assessed the included trials for possible risk of bias accord ing to our Handbook (27). Two of the review authors performe d and agreed upon the assessments work- ing independently. We resolved disagreement s by discussions or, if required, by con- sulting one of the ot her review authors. Data extraction One review author extracted data from the included references and another review author verified the data. We extracted the following data: Informatio n about the study (authors, year of pub- lication, setting, study design , clinical trial identification number and funding); participant characteristics (gender, age, disease stage, known mutations, previous drug treatment); intervention and control ch aracteristics (which drugs, doses, length of use); endpoints (which endpoints were examined, methods used to analyse out- come data, length of follow up and loss to follow up). Statistical analyses and presentation of results Measures of treatment effect We expressed the comparative effectiveness of the treatments as the relative risk (RR) of dichotomous endpoints, hazard ra tio (HR) for time-to-event endpoints and mean difference (MD) for continuous endpoints. If a continuous outcome had been measured/reported using different instrume nts/scales in the in cluded randomized controlled trials we would have calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD). For all endpoints 95% confidence intervals (C I, results from pairwise meta-analyses) or credible intervals (CrI, results from ne twork meta-analyses) were calculated for the RR, HR, MD or SMD. The credibility interval is the Bayesian analogue to the confidence intervals used in traditional frequentist stat istical approaches. We con- sidered a result \"significant\" if the CrI did not include RR/HR = 1 or MD/SMD=0. 34 Clinical evaluation - Methods Meta-analyses When appropriate according to population , intervention, control and outcome, we performed meta-analyses. First, we conduc ted pairwise meta-analyses for each avail- able endpoint for all possible combinations of interventions and controls with availa- ble evidence from included trials. Random effect models were assumed. Estimates of RR, HR, MD, or SMD with corresponding 95% CI were provided. These analyses were performed using the so ftware RevMan 5.3. Second, we performed a network meta-anal ysis (NMA) for each endpoint individu- ally. We did this by combining direct and in direct effects of the interventions of inter- est for each endpoint. The analysis was ba sed on Multiple Treatments Meta-analysis (MTM) as described by Salanti (28). We used the arm-based network meta-analysis method (a Bayesian method based on Markov Chain Mo nte Carlo simulation). All NMAs were performed using Winbugs versio n 1.4.3 (Imperial College and MRC, UK). The statistical analysis was based on binomial likelihoods (dichotomous endpoints) and normal likelihood (continuous endpoint s), with vague priors for the trial base- lines, basic parameters (normal distributi on with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.0001) and the random effects standard de viation (uniformly di stributed in the in- terval 0 to 2), and takes the correlation structure induced by multi-arm trials into ac-count. For time-to-event endpoints (overall survival and progression free survival), with HR as the measure of effect, we used the method described by Woods et al (29) to combine hazard ratios, cumulative number of events, and median survival statis-tics. We used a random effects model. We checked for incoherence between direct and indirect evidence by \"node-splitting\" (30). We calculated the direct and indirect esti-mates of effect and the corresponding Ba yesian \"P-values\" for incoherence. We also ranked the different treatments in terms of their likelihood of leading to the best results for each endpoint. We based the rankings on the surface under the cu- mulative ranking curve (SUCRA) (31). We in terpreted the rankings cautiously taking into account the quality of the evidence. The estimated treatment effect based on the direct evidence from the NMA (pre- sented in the summary of findings tables (SoF tables in Appendix 8) may differ somewhat from the results from the pairwise comparisons obtained from RevMan in Appendix 6. The differences are due to the use of different methods (RevMan and NMA), but both are based upon the same pa irwise dataset from the included trials. If data were available, we intended to ca rry out subgroup analyses for different cate- gories of the population (for example pa tients that are BRAF V600 mutation posi- tive; previously untreated/treated patients) and; different uses of the drug (for ex- ample as mono-or combination therapy). However, we decided not to carry out these analyses due to scarcity in data. 35 Clinical evaluation - Methods The dose-comparison trials of Hamid 2011 (3 2) and Robert 2014 (33) showed that the effect of ipilimumab and pembrolizumab did not seem to depend upon the doses given. As a consequence we have co mbined different dose s of ipilimumab and pembrolizumab into one group. We have treated different doses of the other interventions in a similar way, this was however, only relevant for trametinib. Dealing with missing data For the endpoint progression free surviv al, we assumed that participants who dropped out experienced disease progression if a hazard ratio between intervention and control was not reported. For all other endpoints, we did not perform imputations for missing data. We based the statistical an alyses on the intentio n-to-treat principle (all participants analysed in the group to wh ich they were allocated, and all available data included in the analyses). Grading the quality of evidence Two review authors assessed the overall quality of evidence for each endpoint using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). We followed the guidelines provided by the GRADE working group (34) and catego- rized our confidence in quality of the effe ct estimates into four levels: high, moder- ate, low and very low. The quality of the direct evidence, indire ct evidence, and the combined evidence from the NMAs was evaluated using the GRADE approach for network meta-anal- yses (35). We used the Guideline Development Tool (G DT) (36), while evaluating the quality of the direct evidence. 36 Clinical evaluation - Results Clinical evaluation - Results Result of literature search The literature searches were performed in February 2015, and updated in September 2015. The complete search strategies are sh own in Appendix 1. We searched only for randomized controlled trials, and identified 621 titles in February and additionaly 83 in the update search in September 2015. From these 704 titles we found 93 titles to be potentially relevant and we reviewed the full text publications. However, for 56 of these references no full text was available, and we reviewed the available ab- stracts. From these we included 17 full text publications and seven abstracts. Fur- ther, we found two full texts by manual sear ch in PubMed after inputs from the ab- stracts from the latest meetings for the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the European Cancer Congre ss (ECC). From the manufactures we re- ceived 75 titles (26 full text publications and 49 abstracts/posters). From these we included five full publications, fi ve abstracts and four posters. Finally, 40 publications (24 full text public ations and 16 abstracts/posters) met the pre-specified inclusion criteria.Those publications represent 17 unique clinical trials. The excluded publications, from our own search, and from the ones received from the manufactures, including reasons for the exclusions, are given in Appendix 2. Our searches in websites of sister health technology assessment agencies in August 2015 did not identify further tria ls, for details see Appendix 3. Possible relevant ongoing trials are listed in Appendix 4. 37 Clinical evaluation - Results Figure 1 Flowchart of identification of documentation Description of included trials Seventeen randomized controlled trials with specific NCT nu mbers (ClinicalTri- als.gov registry number) were included (9 -15, 37-46). These tr ials were published from 2010 to 2015 in a total of 40 publicat ions (9-15, 37-68). Of these, 24 were pub- lished as final full text publications and 16 were published as abstracts or posters. The abstracts and posters were either update s of the mother trials with respect to 93 publications evaluated from own search (full text/abstracts) 75 references received from the manufactures 26 publications included (19 full text articles and 7 abstracts 75 publications evaluated from the manufactures (full text/ab- stracts/ posters ) 704 references indetified from our own searches in 2015: 621 from search in February; 83 additional from search in September 61 publications excluded, (Appendix 2) 14 publications in- cluded (5 full text articles, 5 abstracts and 5 posters) 611 references excluded on the basis of ti- tle and abstract 69 publications excluded, (Appendix 2) Total included: 40 publications (24 full text articles and 16 abstracts/posters), representing 17 randomized controlled trials 2 publications from manual search 38 Clinical evaluation - Results the endpoints overall survival, progression free survival or serious adverse events; or the presentations of health related quality of life data. Most of the publications were of new date, with 24 of the 40 publicatio ns published from 2014 and later, the new- est full text publication wa s published in October 2015 (47), and the newest ab- stracts/posters were from ASCO 2015 (Ameri can Society of Clinical Oncology 2015). An overview of the included publicat ions are shown in the Tables 1 to 5. Population The included trials included patients 18 years, with inoperab le or metastatic malig- nant melanoma. Twelve of the trials report ed that the diagnosis was histologically confirmed (9, 12, 13, 15, 38-41, 43-46). Fifteeen (9-15, 37-40, 43-46) of the 17 trials specified that the included patients should have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Normal organ function was specified as an inclusion criteria in seven of the trials (10-12, 37, 38, 45, 46) and a life expectancy of 3 or 4 months in four of the trials (10, 37, 40, 41) . The median age ranged from 49 to 67, and the proportion of males ranged from 49% to 74.3%. In two of the included trials the range in age was from 17-86 (10) and from 15-89 (38), even though both trials had 18 as their inclusion critera. The majority of the trials (ten of 17) were done on patients previously ph armacologically un- treated. Four of the trials included both previously treated and untreated patients (9, 13, 45, 46) and three of the trials included only patients that were previously phar- macologically treated (37, 38, 69). The previous treatment regimen in Hodi et al re- ported to contain one or more of th e following: dacarbazine, temozolomide, fotemustine, carboplatin, or interleukin -2 . In Weber et al the patients with BRAF wild type tumours must have had progression after anti-CTLA-4 treatment, such as ipilimumab, and patients with BRAF V600 mu tation positive tumour mutation must have had progression on anti-CTLA-4 treatment and a BRAF inhibitor. Ribas et al (38) included patients previously treate d with ipilimumab, and if BRAF V600 mu- tant-positive, previously treated with a BRAF or MEK inhibitor or both. Patients with identified BRAF V600 mutation, either specifically identified as BRAF V600E (10, 11) or BRAF V600E or V600K (12, 13, 15, 45, 46) were included in the seven trials with BRAF and/or MEK inhibi tors as the intervention. Patients that were included in the trials where the intervention acts on the immune system, had not identified any BRAF mutation, except in four trials (38, 39, 43, 44) that identi- fied both patients with an d without BRAF mutation. Interventions All the seven interventions defined in our inclusion criteria are represented in the included randomized controlled trials, i.e. cobimetini an d was however only studied in combination with vemurafenib (12). Since the seven included inter- ventions were used both as monotherapy (9-11, 14, 38, 39, 46, 69), monotherapy as add-on (37, 39-42), and in combination with each other (12, 13, 15, 39, 44, 45), we 39 Clinical evaluation - Results had 11 different treatment strate gies available. More details can be seen in Tables 1- 5. Comparator Dacarbazine was used as the comparator in seven of the trials (10, 11, 14, 38, 40, 46, 69), including three trials were the control groups were the investigator choice of chemotherapy: dacarbazine or paclitaxel (4 dacarbazine as one of five investigator-choice chemo- therapies (38, 69) to be equivalent to dacarbazine. The other comparators used in the included trials were ipilimumab for six of the tri- als (9, 37, 39, 41, 42, 44), nivolimumab in one trial (39), dabrafenib in two trials (15, 45), and vemurafenib in two trials (12, 13). Since all the interventions, except cobime tinib, were compared to dacarbazine, di- rectly or indirectly, this was used as ou r common comparator in our NMA. The three arms using investigator choice of chemothe rapy (38, 43, 46) were considered to be equivalent to dacarbazine. Consequently, these three arms were included as dacarbazine arms in the statistical analyses. Endpoints Of the 17 included trials, eight reported on all our predefined endpoints: overall sur- vival, progression free survival, health re lated quality of life and serious adverse events (11, 12, 14, 37, 40, 44, 47, 52); three trials did not report on overall survival (38, 42, 43), two did not report on progre ssion free survival (41, 42), seven did not report health related quality of life (9, 10, 39, 41, 42, 45 , 69), and one did not report any serious adverse events (46). The endpoints were well defined and harmon ized in their definitions across the in- cluded trials. A few trials lack to define some of the endpoints, or differ slightly in their definitions, but the trials that defined their endpoints, did it in the same way: Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Progression free survival was define d as the time from randomization to the earliest date of disease progression or de ath due to any cause. Disease progression was defined by RECIST (Respons Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), version 1.1 (70) in 12 (9, 10, 12-15, 38, 39, 41, 43, 44, 46) of the trials. Health related quality of life was measured by EORTC-QLQ-C30 in ten trials (38, 47, 48, 51, 53, 57, 64, 66, 68, 71) , by EuroQoL EQ-5D in three trials (47, 53, 71), of which one (71) lacked re- sults, and by FACT-M in one trial (47). Se rious adverse events were graded accord- ing to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. (72) for the majority of the trials (9-15, 38, 39, 43, 44, 46). In most of the trials progression free surviv al was assessed by the investigator (14 of 15 trials), in eight of these trials this assessments were also confirmed by an inde- pendent review committee (9, 11-13, 38, 45, 46, 69). Four of these trials reported 40 Clinical evaluation - Results data from both assessments. In one progre ssion free survival was only assessed by an independent review committee) (40). Overall survival was measured with a follow up time from 5 months (11) to 5 years (50). When one study reported from more than one follow up time points, we choose to extract from the first report meas uring 2 years survival (if available) as well as from the latest available data. In our network meta-a nalyses we use the 2 years data. Design All the trials were randomized controlled tria ls, mostly of phase III, three trials were phase II (38, 41, 45), and one was phase I (42). Most of the trials (10 of 17) were open-labelled, the other seven trials were double-blinded (12, 14, 15, 37, 39, 40, 44). All were multicentre trials, the majority were performed in North America and Eu- rope. A total of 7482 patients were included in the 17 trials, with a range from 59 to 945 patients in the respectively trials. The follow-up of overall survival was from 5 months (11) to five years (50). Seven of the trials allowed patients in the control group to cross over to the interven- tion group after progression (38, 41, 44 , 55, 61, 62, 68). McArthur 2014 (61) reported results for overall survival and prog ression free survival both as censored at the time of cross over, and without censorin g at the time of cro ss over. In our anal- yses we only included the data without censor ing at the time of cross over, since this method was used in the other trials. Risk of bias for the endpoints in the included trials We assessed the risk of bias for the endpoints in the included randomized controlled trials to be from low to high risk, mostly of low risk of bias. Eigh t of the trials (9, 12, 14, 15, 39, 40, 42, 69) had low risk of bias for all the reported en dpoints. Progression free survival had low risk of bias in all the trials. We assessed the risk of bias to be high for overall survival, health related qual ity of life, and serious adverse events in the trials that allowed cross over from the controlled group to the intervention group after progression, here we gr aded down for the domain \"Other risk of bias\", for health related quality of life we also graded down to high risk of bias in the open-la- beled trials. The risk of bias as sessments are shown Appendix 5. Statistical analysis in the included trials For all the included trials the efficacy an alyses were performed on the intention-to- treat population, whereas the safety popula tion included all patients who had re- ceived at least one dose of study drug. On e study, however, did not use the intention- to-treat population (41). A tabulated overview of the included randomized controlled trials In tables 1-5 below, we present an overview of the included randomized controlled trials for the different types of intervention s. The randomized controlled trials where 41 Clinical evaluation - Results the intervention acts on th e immune system, eith er by blocking 4 (CTLA-4), or by blocking the interaction of the PD-1 receptor with its two ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, respectively are seen in Table 1 and Table 2. An overview of the randomized controlled trials for the included BRAF inhibitors is given in Table 3. Table 4 shows the included randomized controlled trials for the BRAF inhibitors in combination with th e MEK inhibitors, and Table 5 gives an overview of the included randomized controlled trials where the MEK inhibitors were used as monotherapies. In the tables we have used different colours, in order to make it easier to identify reports from the same trial, i.e. have the same ClinicalTrials.gov registry number (NCT number).

Among these 14 trials, there was only two head to head comparison of two mono- therapies: pembrolizumab vers us ipilimumab (9); and ni volumab versus ipilimumab (39). In both cases a difference in overall su rvival in favour of the intervention group (pembrolizumab and nivolumab respectively) could be established. Further, six of the trials directly compared a combination-therapy versus a monotherapy; these were nivolumab in combination with ip ilimumab versus ipilimimab (39, 44), nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab versus nivolumab (39), dabrafenib in combination with trametinib versus alone dabrafenib in combination with trametinib versus vemurafenib (13). For three of these comparisons (39, 44) (52, 62) (13) a difference in favour of the combination group could be established. 47 Clinical evaluation - Results For the comparisons nivolumab in combinat ion with ipilimumab versus ipilimumab (39, 44), and dabrafenib in combination with trametinib versus da brafenib (52, 62), the results are based on meta-analyses, fo r the remaining comparisons only results from one single trial was available. For the combination dabrafenib in combinat ion with trametinib versus vemurafenib (Combi-v study) (73) the evidence used in our report are the overall survival rates at 12 months. At the time of finalizing this report we have been made aware of 2 year estimates of overall survival from this trial (73). These data confirmed an overall survival in favour of the combination group. Dacarbazine was used as comparator in five of the trials (14, 40, 55, 61, 67), includ- ing one study (67) where dacarbazine or pacl itaxel were used as the comparator . For three of these five trials (14, 40, 61) a difference in overall survival could be estab-lished in favour of the intervention (ipilimumabin combination withdacarbazine, nivolumab, and vemurafenib respectively). More details for all the pairwise comparis ons are shown in Appendix 5 and 6, the latter showing all hazard ratios ba sed upon RevMan analyses. Network meta-analyses The evidence network for overall surviv al (OS) is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 Evidence network for overall survival A summary of results comparing pairwise meta-analyses performed in RevMan and random effects network meta-analysis for the comparisons between the interven- 48 Clinical evaluation - Results tions and the common comparator dacarbazine are presented in Table 6. In addi- tion, a ranking of the included treatments is presented using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). The results of the pairwise estimates from RevMan and NMA are consistent. That is, the results from network meta-analysis and pairwise comparisons are simi lar in magnitude and direction. Table 6 Hazard ratios for overall survival from pairwise comparisons and network meta- analysis Intervention Hazard ratio relative to dacarbazine (pairwise com- parison) Hazard ratio relative to dacarbazine (Network meta-analysis) SUCRA Quality evidence 0.05 - The full network-meta-analysis results comparing all available treatment strategies are presented in Appendix 7. Based on the results of the NMA, we find that nivolumab, pembrolizumab, nivolumab combined with ip ilimumab, vemurafenib combined with cobimetinib, and dabrafenib combined with trametinib has better overall survival than dacarba- zine. The ranking as measured by the SUCRA pembroli- dabrafenib combined with tram etinib have a higher probability of good performance than the other available treatment strategies. Hazard ratios and quality ratings for direct and indirect comparisons for overall sur- vival from the network-meta-analysis are shown in Table 7. Here we present results from all the comparisons with available di rect evidence. A formal test, using \"node- splitting\", for consistency between direct an d indirect evidence re veals no significant difference between the direct and indirect evidence (p-values>0.3) in the network meta-analyses. 49 Clinical evaluation - Results Table 7 Estimates of overall survival and qual ity ratings for direct and indirect compari- sons from network meta-analysis Comparison (study) Direct evidence Indirect evidence Network meta-analysis Hazard ratio (95% CI) Quality of Evidence Hazard ratio (95% CI) Quality of Evidence Hazard ratio (95% CI) Quality of evidence Ipilimumab + dacarbazine versus dacarbazine 0.72 0.42 Moderate Ipilimumab +gp100 versus ipilimumab (37) 1.04 (0.69-1.60) 1.04 Moderate Ipilimumab + dacarbazine versus ipilimumab (41) 0.91 (0.00-880.1) Very low 1.22 (0.35-3.25) 1.01 (0.53-1.62) Moderate Very low 0.65 (0.42-0.91) Moderate *Meta-analysis of two trials (39, 44) **Meta-analysis of two trials (52, 62) More details about the estimates of overa ll survival and quality rating (GRADE) for direct and indirect evidences are shown in the Summary of Finding Tables in Appen- dix 8. 50 Clinical evaluation - Results Sensitivity and subgroup analyses Due to paucity in data we have not performed any sensitivity or subgroup analyses. However, we here present so me descriptive results: Trials that reported overall survival also beyond 2 years Additionally to the overall survival data from the first published report measuring 2 years survival (or less) as shown in Table 7, four trials (15, 40, 55, 62) measured overall survival beyond 2 years follow-up. For these trials we have extracted the lat- est available overall survival data, which were up to 3 years for two comparisons: dabrafenib versus dacarbazine (56) and da brafenibin combinatio n with trametinib versus dabrafenib (52, 63) and up to five years for the comparison ipilimumab in combination with dacarbazine versus daca rbazine (50). The results for overall sur- vival measured based on follow-up to 3 an d 5 years did not differ substantially from the first report measuring up to two year s, for more details see Appendix 9. Drugs that act specifically on the BR AF mutations versus drugs that act on the immune system None of the included trials compared a BR AF inhibitor (dabrafenib or vemurafenib) head to head with a drug acting on the immune system. The best available comparisons are the indirect via dacarbazine as a common comparator. From Table 6 above we see the ranking of those drugs as measured by SUCRA. Trials including previously treated, previously untreated or both patient groups Eight (10-12, 14, 15, 40, 41, 44) of the 13 trials reporting overall survival included previously pharmacologically untreated patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma. Only one of the 13 trials that reported overall survival included patients previously treated (37), and four trials included patients that were both previously treated or untreated (9, 13, 45, 46). In our network meta-analyses we have not taken into account whether the pa tients were previously treated or not. Progression free survival Pairwise comparisons Fifthteen of the 17 included trials reported progression free survival, either from the mother study or in an updated publication (9, 13, 14, 37-40, 44-46, 52, 54, 61, 65, 69). Among these 15 trials, there were only two head to head comparison of two monotherapies (9, 39), and for both thes e comparisons a difference in progression free survival in favour of the intervention (pembrolizumab and nivolumab respec-tively) could be established when compared to ipilimumab. Further, six of the trials compared dire ctly a combination therapy versus a mono- therapy; these were ipilimumab in combin ation with (39, 44), dabrafenib in combination with trametinib versus dabrafenib (45, 52), 51 Clinical evaluation - Results dabrafenib in combination with trametinib versus vemurafenib (13), and vemuraf- enib in combination with cobimetinib ve rsus vemurafenib (65). For all these com- parisons a difference in prog ression free survival in favour of the combination group could be established. For two of the comparisons, ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab versus ipili- mumab (39, 44), dabrafenib in combination with trametinib versus dabrafenib (45, 52), the results are based on meta-analyses, for the remaining comparisons only re- sults from one single trial was available. Dacarbazine was used as comparator in seven of the trials (14, 38, 40, 46, 54, 61, 69) including three trials where dacarbazine were used as on e of two possible options in the control group either as dacarbazine or paclitaxel (46), or as dacarbazine or paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin (69); or as one of five possible options in the control group (38). In five of the seve n trials (38, 40, 46, 54, 61) a difference in progression free survival in favour of the intervention could be established. A meta- analysis of two of the trials (14, 69) did no t identify differences in progression free survival between nivo lumab and control. More details for all the pairwise comparis ons are shown in Appendix 5. Trial de- scription, dataextraction and Risk of Bias tables), and Append ix 6 showing all haz- ard ratios based upon RevMan analyses. Network meta-analyses The evidence network for progression free survival (PFS) is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 Evidence network for progression free survival 52 Clinical evaluation - Results A summary of results comparing pairwise meta-analyses and random effects network meta-analysis for the comparisons between the interventions and the com- mon comparator dacabazine are presented in Table 8. In addition, a ranking of the included treatments are presented using the SUCRA. The results from the direct pairwise comparison performed in RevMan and network meta-ana lysis are seen to be consistent. That is, the results from the network meta-analysis and pairwise com- parisons are similar in magnitude and direction. 53 Clinical evaluation - Results Table 8 Hazard ratios for progression free survival from pairwise comparisons and net- work meta-analysis Interventions Hazard ratio relative to Dacarbazine (pairwise com- parison) Hazard ratio relative to Dacarbazine (network meta-analysis) SUCRA Quality evidence The full network meta-analysis results comp aring all available treatment strategies are presented in Appendix 7. Based on the results from the network meta -analysis, we find that dabrafenib than dacarbazine. In addition, we find that: ipilimumab has poorer progression free survival than dabrafenib, with cobimetinib, ipilimumab. Vemu rafenib combined with cobimetib has bet- ter progression free survival than ni volumab and ipilimum ab combined with dacarbazine. Dabrafinib combined with tr ametinib pembrolizumab. The ranking as measured by the SUCRA suggests that dabrafenibin combination with trametinib and vemurafenib combined with cobimetinib has a higher probability of better performance than the other avail- able treatment strategies. Hazard ratios and quality ratings for direct and indirect comparisons for progression free survival from the network meta-analysis analyses are shown in Table 9. Here we 54 Clinical evaluation - Results present results from all the comparisons wi th available direct evidence. A formal test, using \"node-splitting\", for consistency between direct and indirect evidence re- veals no significant difference between th e direct and indirect evidence (p-val- ues>0.10) in the network meta-analyses.

Sensitivity and subgroup analyses Due to paucity in data we have not performed any sensitivity or subgroup analyses. However, we here present so me descriptive results: Drugs that act specific on the BRAF mutations versus drugs that act on the immune system None of the included trials compared a BR AF inhibitor (dabrafenib or vemurafenib) head to head with a drug acting on the immune system. The best available comparisons are the indirect via dacarbazi ne as a common comparator. From Table 8 above we see the ranking of those drugs as measured by SUCRA. Trials including previously treated, previously untreated or both patient groups Seven (14, 40, 44, 52, 54, 61, 65) of the 13 trials reporting progression free survival included previously pharmacologically untreated patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma. Only two of the 13 trials that reported progression free survival included patients previously tr eated (37, 69), and four trials included patients that were both previously treated or not (9, 13, 45, 46). In our network meta-analyses we have not taken into account whether the patients were previously treated or not. Serious adverse events Pairwise comparisons Sixteen of the 17 included trials reported serious adverse events, either from the mother study or in an updated publication (9, 12-14, 37-42, 44, 45, 52, 56, 61, 69). Among these 16 trials, there were two head to head comparison of two monothera- pies (9, 39), for both these comparisons fewer serious adverse even ts in intervention group (pembrolizumab and nivolumab respecti vely) than in to the ipilimumab group could be established. Further, six of the trials compared directly a combination- therapy versus a monotherapy; these were nivolumab in combination with ipili- mumab versus ipilimumab (39, 44), in comb ination ipilimumab versus (39), dabrafenib combination versus enib (12); and dabrafenib in combination with trametinib versus vemurafenib (13). For two of these comparisons a differences between groups in the number of partici- 56 Clinical evaluation - Results pants experiencing serious adverse events could be established: fewer serious ad- verse events for nivolumab than for nivo lumab in combination with ipilimumab (39); and fewer serious events for dabrafenib in combin ation with tramet- inib than for vemurafenib For co mparisons nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab versus ipilimumab (39, 44), an d dabrafenib in comb ination with tramet- inib versus dabrafenib (45, 52) the result s are based on meta-analyses, for the re- maining comparisons only results from one single trial was available. Dacarbazine was used as comparator in six of the trials (14, 38, 40, 56, 61, 69), in- cluding two trials where dacarbazine were used either as one of two possible options in the control group (dacarbazine or pacl itaxel in combination with carboplatin) (43), or as one of five possible chemotherapies in the control group (38). For three of these comparisons (38, 40, 43) a difference between groups could be established in the number of participants experiencing serious adverse events. This was in fa- vour of dacarbazine when compared to ip ilimumab in combinat ion with dacarbazine (40), in favour of nivoluma b when compared to dacarbaz ine or paclitaxel in combi- nation with carboplatin (43), and in favo ur of pembrolizumab when compared to dacarbazine as one of five possible chemotherapies (38). For the comparison nivolumab versus dacarbazine (14, 69), the results are based on a meta-analysis, for the remaining comparisons only results from one single trial was available. The most common serious adverse events (grade 3 or 4) reported from the studies were gastrointestinal, immu ne-related, squamous carcinoma/keratoacanthoma. Trametin ib reported hypertension. Combination treatment of ipilimumab an d nivolimumab reported gastrointestinal and hepatic events. The combination treatment increased creatinine kinase and hepatic penia, neutropenia, leukopenia, anaemia), immune related events, gastrointestinal, and fatigue. More details for all the pairwise comparison s are shown in in Appendix 5 and 6, the latter showing all hazard ratios ba sed upon RevMan analyses. 57 Clinical evaluation - Results Network meta-analyses The evidence network for serious adverse events is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4 Evidence network fo r serious adverse events A summary of results comparing pairwise meta-analyses and random effects network meta-analysis for the comparisons between the interventions and the com-mon comparator darcabazine is presented in Table 10. In addition a ranking of the included treatments is presented using the SUCRA. The results from the pairwise es- timates performed in RevMan and network meta-analyses are consistent when it comes to the ability to conclude, but the es timated direction of th e difference relative to dacarbazine seems to differ between th e pairwise comparisons and the network meta-analysis for vemurafenib and dabrafenib (for neither of the treaments, neither the pairwise comparisons nor the network meta-analysis could establish a difference relative to dacarbazine). 58 Clinical evaluation - Results Table 10 Hazard ratios for serious adverse events from pairwise comparisons and net- work meta-analysis The full network-meta-analysis results comparing all available treatment strategies are presented in Appendix 7. Based on the results of the network meta-a nalysis, we could not establish any differ- ences between the available treatment strategies. However, the ranking as measured by the SUCRA suggests that pembrolizumab and nivolumab has a higher probability of fewer serious adverse events than the other available treatment strategies, even though we could not establish any differences. Hazard ratios and quality ratings for direct and indirect comparisons for overall sur- vival from the network meta-analyses are sh own in Table 11. Here we present results from all the comparisons with available di rect evidence. A formal test, using \"node- splitting\", for consistency between direct and indirect evidence did not establish any significant differences between the direct an d indirect evidence (p-values >0.12), but at the same time the estimates from the di rect and indirect evid ence pointed in op- posite directions.

Sensitivity and subgroup analyses Due to paucity in data we have not performed any sensitivity or subgroup analyses. However, we here present so me descriptive results: Drugs that act specific on the BRAF mutations versus drugs that act on the immune system None of the included trials compared a BR AF inhibitor (dabrafenib or vemurafenib) head to head with a drug acting on the immune system. The best available comparisons are the indirect via dacarbazine as a common comparator. From table xx above we see the ranking of thos e drugs as measured by SUCRA. Trials including previoulys treated, pr eviously untreated or both patient groups Nine (12, 14, 40-42, 44, 52, 56, 61) of the 14 trials reporting SAEs included previously pharmacologically untreated patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma. Only two of the 13 trials that reported serious adverse events included patients previously treated (37, 69), and three trials included patients that were both previously treated or not (9 , 13, 45). In our network meta-analyses we have not taken into account whether the patients were previously treated or not. Health related quality of life Pairwise comparisons Ten of the 17 included trials reported health related quality of life (38, 47, 48, 51, 53, 57, 64, 66, 68, 71). In all ca ses, except for Ribas 2015 (3 8), the health related quality of life were not reported in the mother pu blication, but in a se parate publication re- porting the HRQoL data. In all the ten tria ls the instrument use was the European Organization for Research and Treatment of cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORCT-QLQ-C30), three of these trials also used the EuroQol (EQ-5D) Questionnaire (47, 53, 71). However, Long 2015 did not present any results from the EuroQol (EQ-5D). One of the trials (47) fu rther used the Functi onal Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Me lanoma (FACT-M). The evidence available were mostly of poor quality, as six of the trials did not pre- sent the uncertainty (SD, SE, CI or p-value) associated with the results. Therefore, 61 Clinical evaluation - Results we cannot use the results from the trials in our network meta-analysis, and a cau- tious interpretation of the conclusions presented in the publications are needed. However, the four studies that reported co nfidential interval (38, 47, 57, 68), re- ported better health related quality of life in the intervention group as compared to the control group (dabrafenib versus da carbazine, trametin ib versus and dabrafenib + trametinib versus vemurafenib respectively). None of the ten trials presented any head to head comparison of two monotherapies. For the comparisons that reported results with confidential interval there was one trial that compared directly a combinatio n- therapy versus a monotherapy: dabraf- enib in combination with tramet inib versus vemurafenib (47). Dacarbazine was used as comparator in five of the trials (38, 51, 57, 68, 71), includ-ing one study (68) where dacarbazine or pacl itaxel were used as the comparator, and another (38) where dacarbazine was used as one of five possible investigator-choice chemotherapies. For the three trials that re ported confidential intervals, the health related quality of life were in favour of the intervention group (dabrafenib, tramet- inib or pembolizumab respectively) (38, 57, 68). Appendix 10 presents a descriptive overview of the evidences for health related qual- ity of life. More details of the st udies are found in Appendix 5. Network meta-analyses Due to insufficient data we have not perform network meta-analyses for health re- lated quality of life. 62 Economic evaluation - Methods Economic evaluation - Methods General This methods section describe s our cost-utility analysis (CUA) of interventions tar- geting patients with metastatic and/or unresectable malignant melanoma. We refer to the interventions by their active ingredient. The interventions are dacarbazine, as monotherapy or in combinations. All costs are in 2015 Norwegian kroner (NOK) and reflects the health care perspec-tive. Both costs and effects are discounted by 4% annually as currently recom- mended by the Norwegian Ministry of Fina nce and guidelines for health economic evaluation in the health sector (74). The health care perspective is relevant fo r prioritization of interventions within a fixed budget if the aim of the decision make r is to maximize health (no expansion of the budget is assumed). The methodological guidelines for economic evaluation in the health sector recommends a societal perspective that includes consequenses for all parts of the economy, including time co sts, the deadweight loss of taxation, any productivity changes, and excluding transf ers such as value added tax . This per- spective is more appropriate if an expansio n of the budget is assumed and in settings where prioritization of interventions across sectors of th e economy is relevant (e.g. for public health interventions). Model Structure We used a probabilistic disc rete-time Markov cohort mode l to record the transition between health states, each of which are a ssociated with a health-related quality of life weight and a cost. The time horizon is 10 years with a monthly cycle-length. The model has three mutually exclusive disease-related health states: Progression- free disease (PFS) (1), Progressed disease (PD) (2) and Death (3) (Figure 5). All pa- tients start in the progression-free disease state. For every model cycle, the arrows 63 Economic evaluation - Methods indicates that a proportion of the patients may remain in the same health state, an- other proportion may experience progress ion and another may die, determined by the transition probabilities. Disease regression in the form of transiti on from progressed di sease to progression free survival is by assumption not possible. The model does not include treatment sequences. We used R version 3.2.2 (75) for the estimation of the cumulative density functions and baseline transition prob abilities, and Tree age Pro 2015 \u00a9 (76) for the decision modelling. Figure 5 Diagram of the health states an d possible transitions in the Markov model Model Parameters See appendix 16 for a complete list of a ll the model parameters and distributions. Transition probabilities For the baseline overall suvival and progression free survival we fitted cumulative density functions from the dacarbazine arm of a randomized controlled trial, pub- lished by Robert 2011 (40) and Maio 2015 (50) (Table 12). The choice of cumulative density function was based on the best fit as evaluated by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Since use of this criteria gives no formal test of the quality of the absolute fit to the data, we checked how well the parametric 64 Economic evaluation - Methods function for overall survival fitted the patien t-level data we used as well as the over- all survival of Norwegian stage III and IV malignant melanoma-patients as reported by the Cancer Registry. The data we used seems to fit the survival of Norwegian ma- lignant melanoma stage IV patients better th an stage III patients . Appendix 10 gives more details. We were unable to distinguish between mort ality before and after progression in the model without compromising the accuracy of the model estimation of overall sur- vival. We therefore assumed that the prob ability of death was independent of pro- gression status. We used the transition probability formula suggested by Briggs (77) in order to esti- mate the transition probability from alive to death (the transitions from health state 1 to 3 and 2 to 3) and from progression fr ee survival to progressed disease (1 to 2). From the fundamental relationships for probabilities of mutually exclusive events, it follows that the transition probability from progressive free survival to progressive disease (1 to 2) is one minus the probabilit y of death minus the pr obability of staying in the progressive free survival health state. Although the above relationship should hold , we were not able to calculate the tran- sition probabilities in this way with the parametric functions at hand. The decision tree (Figure 6) shows that the transitions from progression free survival to progres- sive disease or death in fact was calculated in two steps, first with regards to death (overall survival) and then for progression , conditional on survival. Appendix 12 gives more explanations for the choices made. Figure 6 Decision tree structure for the Markov model 65 Economic evaluation - Methods Table 12. Fitted distributions for the dacarbazine-arm in Robert 2011/Maio 2015 (NCT00324155) Active ingredient/s , 3.16 Parameters are defined as in R: Shape and scale. Treatment effects We used the hazard ratios relative to dacarbazine from the network meta-analysis (Table 13) to adjust the transitions from aliv e to dead (1 to 3 and 2 to 3) and progres- sion free survival to progressed dise ase (1 to 2) showed in figure 5. Use of the hazard ratio assumes that the relationship between the times-to-events (survival and disease progression) of dacarbazine and each of these treatments is constant over time. In the base case analysis, the hazard ratios are applied up to two years, assuming no treatment effects past two years of treatment for any of the interventions. When treatment stops, the hazard ratios are one, and consequently we assume the same mortality as the dacarbazine-population past two years for all interventions. Any ac- cumulated survival and progression benefits would however have an impact also af- ter treatment discontinuation, until simulati on ends at 10 years (the time horizon of the model). Table 13. Hazard ratios used in model to modify the probab ility of death and progression in the model. Active ingredient/s Overall survival (95% CI) 66 Economic evaluation - Methods Costs We received input regarding the course of the disease and the current course of treatment in Norway from Jarle Karlsen (oncologist, St. Olav Hospital, Trondheim) and Oddbj\u00f8rn Straume (oncologist, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen), both appointed by the four regional health auth orities. We combined their feedback with price and fee information from different so urces to estimate the costs associated with each treatment strategy. We included the following costs: - BRAF gene mutation diagnostic testing - Drug acquisition costs - Oral drug dispensing costs - Administration of parenteral therapies - Monitoring costs before an d after disease progression - Hospital treatment of serious adverse events (SAEs) We assumed that patients with advanced malignant melanoma would generally be entitled the health exemption card, and re sultably counted the patient's copayments as a cost from the health care perspective. BRAF gene mutation diagnostic testing It has become current practice in Norway to test all unresectable and/or metastatic malignant melanoma patients for the BRAF gene mutation. Information on the mu-tation status of the patient can be used to determine whether the patient should re- ceive immuno- or BRAF gene mutation targeted therapy. In our model, the only treatment arm not tested for genetic mutations is the dacarbazine-arm. This arm was included as a comparator to reflect the situation as if the new therapies were not an option. In such a context, the results of the test would not add valuable information as the treatm ent would be the same independently of the test result. Based on communication with head of unit for molecular pathology at Oslo Univer- sity Hospital, Lene Eggen, we assumed that all patients are tested with a BRAF qPCR test and around 15% also with a BRAFpyro. The BRAF gene mutation rate among Norwegian malignant melanoma patients is around 50%. All patients who do not have the BRAF gene mutation are su bsecquently tested for neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) gene mutation. Oslo University Hospital provided us with test cost data that indicated that the real costs associated with each BRAF qPCR is around three times hi gher than the reim- bursement they receive from the public budget. However, since they did not have similar estimates for the two other tests, we used the reimbursement fees for those tests. Our average cost estimate for the cost of testing is NOK 4,089 per patient (Ta-ble 14). 67 Economic evaluation - Methods Table 14.

Medicine costs The medicine costs depends on the acquisit ion price, the dosages and duration of treatment. The price paid by the regional health auth orities consists of the maximum pharmacy retail price, adjusted for any discount negotiated through the Drug Procurement Co-operation system (LIS). We could not use any discounted prices for any of the new interventions in our analysis because they are not open to the public as per contract between LIS and the producers. We therefore used the maximum pharmacy retail price as of October 2015 in the base case analysis (78). However, we used the LIS-discounted price for dacarbazine si nce it is publicly available. The dosages we used corresponds to the information in the summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and an overview of th e dosages used is provided in appendix 12. In clinical practice, the actual cumulati ve dose may however be lower than the planned cumulative dose, for instance due to drug intolerance. The relative dose in- tensity of dabrafenib in the Combi-D study was about 88% (personal communica- tion). We used the same relative dose tensity dabrafenib in combination with- in combination with cobi- metinib in the model, based on expert advice from Oddbj\u00f8rn Straume. Based on experience from clinical practice in Norway, the number of doses each pa- tient receives on average with ipilimumab are likely to be less than four. Of the first 100 Norwegian patients treated with ipilimum ab, 61 received at least four doses and 17 received less than four doses. But since data were missing for 22 patients at the time of writing we were not able to calculate a weighted average with Norwegian data (personal communication). From the relative dose intensity information re- ported in Postow 2015 (79), we calculat ed a weighted average for ipilimumab in monotherapy of 3.5 doses and in combin ation therapy (with nivolumab) of 3.2 doses. 68 Economic evaluation - Methods For the PD-1 immunotherapies, nivoluma b and pembrolizumab, we were advised from our clinical experts to assume that treatment could be provided both in the progression free and progressed health states. In addition we assumed a gradual de- cline in the proportion being treated over time of those alive, according to infor- mation given in the appendix to Larkin 2015 (80) at 12 months of follow-up, and as- suming no treatment after two years. There is no accumulation of medicine co sts past two years du e to the assumption that treatment stops at this time. Table 15 summarises the assumptions we have made in the base case model. Table 15 Overview of assumptions made about treatment in the model Active ingredient Information about treatment and treatment duration Percentage of planned doses Oral medicines Dabrafenib Treatment in PFS-health state to month 24, then Dacarbazine: Treatment in PFS- health state to month 24, then no treatment. Ipilimumab: 88% (Assuming 4 planned doses) Treatment in PFS month 24, then no treatment Ipilimumab: 80% (Assuming 4 planned doses) Nivolumab: Proportion of those alive, under treat- ment, reduced in PFS and PD to month 24, then no treatment Proportion of those alive, under treat- ment, reduced per as for nivolumab. Same as for nivolumab. 69 Economic evaluation - Methods *Based on relative dose intensity information fo r ipilimumab in monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab as reported in Postow 2015 supplementary appendix, table S3 (79). ** The monthly percentage reduction matches the reported proportion of those being treated and alive in Larkin 2015 supplementary appendix, table S1, at 12 months (80). For nivolumab in monotherapy, the proportion at 12 months was 51%. For nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab, the proportion was 41%. After 12 months, the monthly percentage reduction results in that no patients are treated past 24 months. ***Based on information on relative dose intensities in the Combi-D study. Table 16 summarizes the medicine costs esti mates per model cycle (month), with the exception of ipilimumab, where the total drug cost is valid only for the first model cycle. For more details about the drug cost estimtation and drug dosages, see appen- dix 13. Table 16. Drug costs per cycle (VAT included). Treatment First month Months beyond the first Full cost in the first month of treatment in the model. Assumed 3,2 doses per patient on average in combination therapy wi th nivolumab and 3,5 doses per patient on average in monotherapy and in combination with dacarbazine. ** Cobimetinib does not have marketing author ization in Norway. We assumed that the per cycle cost of cobimetinib would be the same as for trametinib. *** The drug cost per cycle after the combination period of 3 months is the same as the per cycle cost for nivolumab in monotherapy. Drug dispensing costs We estimated that 80% of the patients rece iving medicines in tablet form would pre- pare their doses alone (personal communica tion with Jarle Karlsen and Oddbj\u00f8rn Straume), while the other 20% would get help from either a nurse (inpatients and 70 Economic evaluation - Methods homecare patients) or the hospital's pharmacy (outpatients). Dispensing and con- trolling every dose requires two people (one pharmacist and one pharmacy-techni- cian or another pharmacist) to spend 5 mi nutes of work each (personal communica- tion). Assuming an average gross wage of NOK 205/hour 3.4/minute), the dispensing costs are NOK 17/dose per person involved. The cost esti- mate does not include overhead costs. The estimates does not include overhead costs due to lack of information. Table 17 shows the estimates for the relevant drugs. Table 17. Dispensing costs per mo del cycle for oral medicines.

For all therapies given intravenously we assumed that administration co sts per dose to the hospital were reflected by 7 % of the reimbursement rate for the DRG code 809H, which amounts to NOK 1,312. This estimate takes into account all costs othe r than drug acquisition associated with each intravenous procedure, i.e. wages, material, overheads but not capital costs 71 Economic evaluation - Methods (amortization, interest expenses, building and equipment rental costs).1 The results are summarized in Table 18.

Drug-therapy related serious adverse events (SAEs) We chose to include serious adverse events requiring hospitalization, i.e. adverse events grade 3 and 4. The monthly costs related to serious adverse events are deter- mined by the cost of hospitalisation and th e average monthly probability of such an event. The cost of an adverse event related hospital ization were assumed to be equal to 100% of the reimbursement rate for the DRG code 453B 2, i.e. NOK 20,814. We estimated the average monthly rate of a serious adverse event from patients included in the dacarbazine arm of the NCT00324155 trial published in Robert 2011 (40) and Robert 2015 (14), the only publications withou t cross-over after progression where in addition dacarbazine was admi nistered as monotherapy. The average montlhy rate of 1.64% is the arithmetic average of the monthly frequency of experiencing serious adverse events. 1 Based on information from Norwegian Directorate of Health, Department of Economy and Analysis. Wages and other costs share of DRG cost for DRG 809H. 2 DRG code for complication asso ciated with other treatment. 72 Economic evaluation - Methods We adjusted the baseline risk of an adverse event with the relative risk of adverse event versus dacarbazine identified in our meta-analysis (Clinical Evaluation results chapter). Table 19 summarizes the expected cost per model cycle for each treatment arm and the associated cycle prob ability and relative risk. Any serious treatment related adverse events post progression is assumed to be included in the per cycle monitoring cost for the progressed disease state. Table 19.

Monitoring costs In the progression free health state pa tients are followed up during and after treatment stop in order to assess the course of the disease. While at treatment, the intensity and content of this follow-up schedule varies across interventions, and includes outpatient visits to specialists (oncologists an d/or dermathologists), blood analyses and diagnostic imaging (CT, ultrasound, bone scintigraphy, PET and/or MR). The resulting cost estimates are shown in Table 20. 73 Economic evaluation - Methods Table 20. Monitoring costs per model cycle in the progression-free health state Treatment Monitoring costs (NOK/model 3,820 In the progressed health state the costs consists of a mix of surgery, radiotherapy and palliative treatment at a hospital center and/or through day care. Although we assume that some patients may be tr eated with PD-1 immunotherapy post progression (Table 15), we consider a mi x of best supportive care (BSC) to best reflect the per cycle costs in the progressed health state. Table 21. Monitoring costs per model cy cle when treatment is discontinued Treatment Monitoring costs (NOK/model cycle) All 11,747 See appendix 12 for more details rega rding our monitoring costs estimates. Health related quality of Life We conducted a separate search in the literature for health related quality of life data measured with generic multi-attribute instruments or other instruments that pro-vides values valid for use in economic eval uations. See Appendix 13 for more infor- mation. We used EQ-5D values from Grob 2015 (47) for vemurafenib in monotherapy and dabrafenib and trametinib in combination thereapy to in form the progressive free survival and progressed disease health stat es for those interventions. We transferred the vemurafenib monotherapy values to dabrafenib monotherapy and the dabrafenib values to the combination vemurafenib and cobimetinib. Grob 2015 (47) indicated a slight decrease in health related quality of life following progression for vemurafenib in monotherap y, but an increase for the BRAF and MEK combination therapy. We chose not to in clude this increase in the analysis for the combination therapies, in stead fixing the health related quality of life at the same level as in the progre ssive free health state. 74 Economic evaluation - Methods The EQ-5D values for the interventions involving immunotherapies are from table 9 in a recently published single technology assessment of pembrolizumab compared to ipilimumab (81). To our knowledge all the EQ-5D values used the UK-tariff. Table 22 shows the EQ-5D values we used in the model analysis for progression-free survival and progressed disease. The immuno therapies have a slightly higher health related quality of life in the progressive fr ee survival health states than the BRAF and MEK mono- and combination therapie s, but the BRAF and MEK combination therapies have a slightly higher health re lated quality of life in the progressed dis- ease state. Serious adverse events does not influence on HRQoL in our model because of the short duration, but the cost per cycle due to such events is included, as explained above for costs. We used the BRAF or MEK monotherapies he alth related quality of life values for the common comparator dacarbazine. Table 22. Health-related quality of life before and after progression.

Our suggestions about cost-effectiveness will reflect a rang e of potential willin gness-to-pay (WTP) values per gained QALY. Separate scenario analysis will invest igate the importance of drug pricing, the choice of time horizon and health related quality of life weights. In the end of the chapter we will present a budget impact analysis. The cost-effectiveness frontier curve and the the cost-effectivenes plane gives a quick overview of how the interventions compare to each other. The point estimate results in table format for the incremental analyses are based on the Monte Carlo simulations. The Monte Carlo results are presented as scatterplots , cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEAC) and expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI). The results will be presented for willingness to pay values to a maximum of NOK 2.000.000 per QALY gained. We used 10.000 iterations in the Monte Carlo analyses. Table 23 shows the interventions we includ ed in the three incremental analyses. In Norway, all advanced malignant melanoma patients are tested for the BRAF gene mutation before deciding on treatment. Results for the whole target population, including all drugs. The first analysis includes all the intervention s included in the systematic review and network meta-analysis, which included all advanced malignant 76 Economic evaluation - Results melanoma patients irrespective of BRAF gene mutation status. However, in clinical practice, all patients are tested for the BRAF gene mutation status, so this analysis reflects a situation where both immunotherapies and BRAF/MEK therapies are considered relevant treatment options for BRAF gene mutation positive patients. Results for the BRAF gene mutation positive population including only the BRAF inhibitors and the MEK inhibitors. The second analysis covers only the BRAF/MEK inhibitors to reflect a situation where immunotheraphy are not an option for BRAF gene mutation positive patients. Results regardless of BRAF status, including only the immunotherapies. This analysis reflects a situation where immunotherapies are considered relevant, regardless of the BR AF gene mutation status. We did not conduct any subgroup analysis of the treatment effects, so analysis one and three rests on the assumption that th e treatment effects of the immunotherapies are the same regardless of BRAF status. For the BRAF/MEK inhibitors in analysis two we assume that previous treatment with immunotherapy do not influence the treatment effects. It can be discussed whether or not dacarbazine is a relevant intervention to include in the incremental analysis when immunoth eraphies or BRAF/MEK inhibitors are available as treatment options. We therefor e present some of the results both with and without dacarbazine. In the results of the incremental analyses reported in table format, we may refer to the \"undominated\" strategies. These are the interventions that have not been ruled out in the incremental analysis due to dominance. In the incremental analysis all in- terventions are ranked according to costs (from lowest to highest), and some inter- ventions are ruled out due to dominance, i.e having a higher cost and a lower effec- tiveness than the less costly alternative. Others are ruled out because of \"extended\" dominance, i.e. showing a higher incremen tal cost-effectiveness ratio than the less costly non-dominated alternative. If some interventions have similar costs an d effectiveness, one intervention may be highlighted in the incremental analysis in the results tables, but in practice it is diffi- cult to separate this intervention from the others when parameter uncertainty is ac-counted for. The cost-effectiveness graph give an indication of this in cases where some interventions may cluster together for si milar levels of costs and effectiveness. The results of the expected value of partial perfect information analysis are only pre-sented for the first incremental analysis. 77 Economic evaluation - Results Table 23 Complete list of interven tions included in each analysis 1: Patients with ad- vanced malignant mela- noma, including all drugs 2: Patients with advanced malignant melanoma and BRAF gene mutation posi- tive, when immunotherapy is not an option 3: Patients with advanced malignant melanoma, re- gardless of BRAF gene mu- tation status Incremental analyses reported both with and without dacarbazine sensitivity analyses Results when all interventions are included in the analysis Figure 7 shows the cost-effectiveness plane when all intervention s are included in the analysis. The cost effectivenss frontier (blue curve) highlights nivolumab and vemurafenib in combination with cobimeti nib as the undominated strategies. Pem- brolizumab and nivolumab clusters together in the cost-effectiveness plane, indicat- ing that it would be difficult to separate any of these interventions with respect to cost-effectiveness when parameter uncertainty are accounted for. 78 Economic evaluation - Results Figure 7 Cost-effectiveness graph wh en all interventi ons are included Table 24 shows the results of the incremen tal analysis when effectiveness is meas- ured in quality adjusted life years. Nivolumab has an incremental effect of 0.82 qual- ity adjusted life years and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio against dacarba- zine of about 1.1 million NOK per quality adjusted life year gained. The combination vemurafenib in combination with cobimeti nib has an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio against nivolumab of about 19.8 mill ion NOK per quality adjusted life year gained.

Both nivolumab and pembrolizumab does however have quite similar percentages of iterations bein g cost effective. When dacarbazine is ex- cluded from the analysis, trametinib is the most cost-effective strategy up to a will- ingness to pay value of about NOK 0.4 mi llion after which nivolumab is the most cost effective strategy for further increa sing willingness to pay values. The differ- ences between nivolumab and pembrolizumab are more pronounced for lower will- ingness to pay values. 81 Economic evaluation - Results Figure 9 Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve with dacarbazine Figure 10 Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve without dacarbazine The decision model includes many uncert ain input parameters. In the expected value of partial perfect information analys is, the uncertain parameters are grouped according to type and the analysis shows which group of parameters that are the most influental on the results. New research should be aimed on the most influental groups of parameters, because the potential to reduce the decision uncertainty is the largest for those parameteres. Figure 11 shows the results of the expect ed value of partial perfect information analysis per patient for 50 outer x 500 in ner loop Monte Carlo iterations, on the efficacy parameters, the serious adverse ev ents parameters, costs and health related quality of life parameters. Th e results indicates that the treatment efficacy data is the most influental source of uncertainty, foll owed by the health related quality of life data, costs and serious advers events data (hazard ratio for serious advers event). At a willingness to pay level of about NOK 1 million, the expected value of partial perfect information per patient have a value of about NOK 99,000 the treatment 82 Economic evaluation - Results efficacy data (hazard ratios on overall survival and progression free survival), 46,000 for health rela ted quality of life data, 3,700 for costs and 170 for the serious adverse events data.

Dabrafenib and vemurafenib in combi- nation with cobimetinib are the two un dominated strategies . The monotherapies clusters together at a lower level of costs and effectiveness compared to the combi-nation therapies.

The combination vemurafenib in combi- nation with cobimetinib have an incremental effect of 0.53 quality adjusted life years and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared to dabrafenib of about NOK 2.9 million per quality adjusted life year gained. The ranking of the interventions is un-changed when effectiveness is measured in life years gained and the associated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios are as expected a bit lower due to the slightly larger incremental effectiveness when the gained life years are unweighted (Table 29). Table 28 Results of the incremental analys is, excluding dominated strategies (QALY) Intervention Costs (NOK) Incremental Table 29 Results of the incremental analys is, excluding dominated strategies (LYG) Intervention Costs (NOK) Incremental Cost Effectiveness cost-effectiveness acceptability curves are shown both with (Figure 13) and without dacarbazine (Figure 14). The x-axis was extended to a willingness to pay level of NOK 3.0 million in order to impr ove readability. When dacarbazine is in- cluded, the curves shows that dacarbazine is more likely to be cost effective than the alternatives for willingness to pay values up to about 2.0 million NOK. The mono- therapies shows a decreasing trend for furt her increasing willingness to pay values, contrary to the combination st rategies. When dacarbazine is excluded, this picture is repeated, with the BRAF and MEK inhibito rs in monotherapy having the highest probability of being cost-effective for the lowest willingness to pay values and the combination strategies showing an increasing trend for very high willingness to pay values. 84 Economic evaluation - Results Figure 13 Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve with dacarbazine Figure 14 Cost-effectiveness acceptability curve without dacarbazine The scatterplot in Figure 15 there ia a clea r pattern with two separate clouds of scat- ter, one with the monotherapies vemurafenib, trametinib and dabrafeinb and the second with more expensive but more effective combination therapies. 85 Economic evaluation - Results Figure 15 Scatterplot for th e BRAF and MEK inhibitors Results for the immunotherapies Figure 16 reconfirms the same pattern that was shown in Figure 7. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab have very similar cost s and effectiveness.

Nivolumab have an incremental effect of 0.82 quality adjusted life years and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of about 1.1 million NOK per quality adjusted li fe gained, the same as was described for table Table 24 and Table 25. 86 Economic evaluation - Results Table 30 Results of the incremental analys is, excluding dominated strategies (QALYs) Intervention Costs (NOK) Incremental the incr emental analysis, excluding dominated strategies (LYG) Intervention Costs (NOK) Incremental Cost Effects Nivolumab 1,063,492 902,664 2.32 1.02 885,048 Table 32 shows the incremental analysis when dacarbazine is excluded from the comparison. Note that we used the maximum pharmacy retail prices, due to the fact that negotiated discounts are hidden from the general public, as per contract be- tween the Drug Procurement Cooperation system (LIS) and the manufacturers. Hence, our incremental analysis of nivolu mab, pembrolizumab and the esta blished immunotherapy ipilimumab, be interpreted with caution. Nivolu mab and pembrolizumab have very similar costs and effectiveness. The combination therapy nivolumab an d ipilimumab have higher higher costs and the sa me level of effectiveness. Table 32 Results when all in cremental cost-effectiveness ra tios refer to ipilimumab (QALYs) Intervention ptability curves with dacarbazine, and Figure 18 without dacarbazine. When dacarbazine is included as a comparator, the analysis shows that nivolumab is more likely to be cost effective than the alternatives for willingness to pay values exceeding about NOK 1.1 million. Pembrolizumab is however not far behind with respect to the percentage of iterations being cost-effec- tive. When dacarbazine is exluded from th e analysis, ipilimumab in monotherapy is more likely to be cost effective than the alternatives for willingness to pay values be-low NOK 0.3 million, whereafter nivolumab is more likely to be cost effective than the alternatives for increasing willingness to pay values. 87 Economic evaluation - Results Figure 17 Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves with dacarbazine Figure 18 Cost-effectiveness acceptab ility curves without dacarbazine The scatterplot in Figure 19 follows the same pattern as in Figure 8. The scatter for the nivolumab and pembrolizumab in monotherapy clusters at a higher level of ef- fectiveness and costs than ipilimumab in monontherapy or in combination with dacarbazine. The combination nivolumab an d ipilimumab is clea rly separable from the other strategies with the highest expected costs among the alternatives. 88 Economic evaluation - Results Figure 19 Scatterplot of the parenteral based immunotherapies Scenario-analyses Alternative drug prices: All the prices for the new drug interventi ons in our analysis are maximum pharmacy retail prices. In this scenario we will highlight the ex tent of price reduct ions that would be necessary in order for the interventions to match the intervention with the lowest incremental cost-effectiveness ratio against dacarbazine (nivolumab) as well as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio agains t dacarbazine of NOK 500,000 per quality adjusted life year gained. In Table 33, the per-cycle drug costs (not including administration costs) were determined from a series of 1-way sensitivity analyses, changing the per-cycle drug cost of the intervention and choosing the co st that resulted in an incremental cost- effectiveness ratio compared to dacarbazin e that were similar to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of nivolumab comp ared with dacarbazine. The maximum pharmacy retail price afenib in combination cobimetinib, ipili- mumab, and pembrolizumab would need to be reduced by 56 %, 64 %, 65 %, 62 %, 63 %, 40 % and 9 % respectively in order to match the incremental cost-effectiveness of nivolumab versus dacarbazine. For the combination ipilimumab+dacarbazine, the drug cost of ipilimumab would need to be reduced by approximately 51 %. For nivolumab in combination with ipilimum ab, the combined price reduction would have to be about 37 %. 89 Economic evaluation - Results Table 33 Results of drug price scenario when the interventions refer to the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of nivolumab to dacarbazine.

Treatment until progression also for th e PD-1 immunotherapies and different assumptions about tr eatment extension In this scenario we changed the structur al assmumption regarding treatment with nivolumab and pembrolizumab, from treatm ent independent of progression status and gradual reduction in the proportion being treated of those alive over time, to treatment in the progression free health state only, for two years. We also extended the treatment duration from 24 months to 36 months in two scenarios, assuming further treatment for 50 % and 100 % of those in the progression free health state at two years following treatment. The changes we re only applied to the cost side of the model. Table 35 shows the results for our base ca se and the three scenarios. We believe treatment costs are likely to be underestimated for nivolumab and pembrolizumab in monotherapy when the treatment duration is limited to 24 months and to the pro- gression free health state only. The scenario that assumes that 100 % of those in pro- gression free survival at 24 months, will be treated for another 12 months, is the 91 Economic evaluation - Results closest to our base case scenario. Our base case cost estimates for the immunothera- pies are are independent of the transition probability from progressive free survival to progressed disease. Table 35 Results of the scenario analyses. Intervention Base case model 24 months PFS only 24 months PFS only +50 % 10 years) The time-horizon influences both costs and effects, but the ranking of the interven- tions in the incremental analysis is unchanged when we change the time time-hori-zon to 5 years instead of 10 years as in the base case. All othe r assumptions are the same as in the base case.

The tables below summarizes the results for the three incremental analyses. In the first incremental analysis, the incremental effect of nivolumab compared to dacarbazine is reduced compared to the base case analysis, resulting in a higher in- cremental cost-effectiveness ratio for that comparison. In the second analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for da brafenib versus daca rbazine was reduced from NOK 2.2 million to NOK 1.7 million du e to a reduction in the expected QALYs for dacarbazine. Although some changes in the results can be obse rved, the choice of health related quality of life weights and assumptions about different quality of life weights across the interventions does not seem to be decisive for the results of our cost-effectiveness analysis.

In the base case of the model we chose to assu me that cobimetinib has the same price as trametinib and that the co mbination cost was the sum of the monthly cost of vemurafenib in monotherapy plus trametinib, resulting in a combined monthly drug cost of NOK 172,525 per month. We did however receive a montly treatment drug price from Roche of \u20ac12,294 per month (price to wholesaler, GIP) for th e combination vemurafenib and cobimetinib (personal communication). Multiplying with a grossist margin of 1,85 % and an ex- change rate of 1\u20ac=8.78 NOK we get a a pharmacy purchase price (AIP) of about NOK 109,938, and a maximum pharmacy retail (AUP) of NOK 141,5863. If we as- sume a relative dose intensity of 88% as for the other peroral drugs, the monthly drug cost in the model would be NOK 124,596. If all other drug costs remains unchanged, it is not suprising to see improvement both in terms of the incremental cost and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio relative to the alternatives, as is shown in the tables below. In the first incremental analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio relative to nivolumab is almost cut in half. In the second incremental analys is, the combination will be the only undom- inated intervention among the BRAF and ME K inhibitors, but still with a very high incremental cost-effectiveness ratio over NOK 1.8 million per quality adjusted life year gained.

We sepa- rated the drugs into two categories, the peroral BRAF/MEK inhi bitors and the par- enteral based immunotherapies. For the BRAF and MEK inhibitors, the present value of the cumulative drug cost per patient reflects what our decision model predicts for the given dosages and treat- ment duration (2 years) (Table 44). The differences in costs between the interven- tions are large, and the treatment duration s, which are dependent on time in the progression free survival health state, expl ain some of the observed variation (see Table 45). The administration costs are very low for the peroral therapies. The parenteral based immunotherapies have more similar drug costs per patient, with ipilimumab demonstratin g the lowest expected cumulative drug cost. The com- bination ipilimumab+nivolumab have only sl ightly higher expected costs per patient than nivolumab in monotherapy. The admini stration costs are hi gher than for the peroral drugs, but still low relative to the drug cost. The drug costs for ipilimumab as well as the new PD-1 immunotherapies are independent of time in the progressive free survival health state. As for the BR AF/MEK inhibitors, the treatment duration is limited to two years. Table 45 shows the median treatment time and median survival as predicted in the model. The peroral combination therapies ha ve longer treatment duration than the monotherapies, but also longer expected survival. 95 Economic evaluation - Results Table 44 Overview of the input to the budget impact calculations for maximum phar- macy retail price (PRP).

The budgetary impacts are difficult to predict. The impacts will for instance be de-pendent on any change in clinical practice from current practice, the number of pa- tients eligible for the different treatmen t options in any given year, the treatment durations and the drug prices. Also, the pric e paid by the regional health authorities consists of the maximum pharmacy retail pr ice, adjusted for any discount negotiated through the Drug Procurement Cooperatio n system (LIS). The discounts are not publicly available for the interventions in this analysis, and because we can't use the actual LIS prices, we don't have a correct baseline for the budget impact estimation. We will therefore present the budgetary impacts in the form of potential savings to the budget in a case where LIS may have achieved substantial discounts in the re- gion 63-84% of the maximum pharmacy reta il prices across the new interventions, using the results of the price scenarios in Table 34 where drug prices were adjusted according to an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio against dacarbazine of 500,000 NOK per quality adjusted life year gained. We assume that the new immunotherapie s, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and the combination nivolumab+ipilimumab have equal market shares of 33.3%, through- out a 5 year period, assuming 200 new patients each year. For the BRAF/MEK in-hibitors, we assume that the combination therapies each have 33.3% market share with the remaining 33.3% divided betwee n the monotherapies, assuming 100 new patients each year. Table 46 shows the results. The potential annual savings from the immunotherapies are about NOK 131 million per year and for the BRAF/MEK inhibitors NOK 147 mil- lion per year. The combined savings accumulates over a 5 year period to about NOK 1,387 million. 97 Economic evaluation - Results Table 46 The results of the budget impact analysis, when comparing the maximum phar- macy retail price with the discounted price that results in an in cremental cost-effective- ness ratio against dacarbazine of 500,000 NOK per quality adjusted life year gained.

For the effec- tiveness analyses we have systematically reviewed and summarized 17 randomized controlled trials, published in a total of 24 articles and 16 abstracts/posters between 2010 and 2015. We have focused on the clinical important endpoints such as overall survival, progression free survival, health related quality of life, and serious adverse events. Summary of results Clinical effectiveness We performed both pairwise analyses and network meta-analysis for each endpoint individually. For pairwise comparisons we had 15 possi ble comparisons. For overall survival, progression free survival and serious advers e events there were only two head to head comparison of two monotherapies: pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab (9); and nivolumab versus ipilimumab (39). In both cases a difference in favour of the intervention group (pembrol izumab and nivolumab respectively) could be estab- lished for all the three endpoints. There was no head to head comparisons of two monotherapis for health related quality of life. Further, five comparison directly compar ed a combination therapy versus a mono- therapy. The comparison dabrafenib in co mbination with trametinib versus vemu- rafenib was the only one that included all our endpoints, and for all these endpoints we could established a difference in favour of the combination group. None of the included trials compared a BR AF inhibitor (dabrafenib or vemurafenib) head to head with a drug acting on the immune system. More information about the pairwise comp arisons can be seen in Appendix 6. 99 Discussion Our aim are to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the new drugs used for inoperable or metastatic malignant melanoma patients relative to each other. However, due to paucity in data for dire ct comparisons the best available compari- sons are the indirect evidences via dacarbazine as a common comparator. Hence, our conclusions for the relative co mparisons of the incl uded drugs or combi- nations of drugs are based on the network meta-analyses. Further, we indicate a ranking of the different drugs for each endpoi nt in terms of their probability of lead- ing to the best results by help of SUCRA (the surface under the cumulative ranking curve) and by grading the evidence from the network analyses (using the GRADE approach for network meta-analyses). For ov erall survival, progression free survival and serious adverse events all the interventions/treatment strategies were included in the network, hence they could all be comp ared relative to dacarbazine. Due to in- sufficient data we could not performed a network meta-analysis for health related quality of life. Based on the results of the network meta-a nalyses with ranking as measured by the SUCRA: Comparisons of the efficacy for the BRAF/MEK inhibitors versus the immunotherapies Nivolumab, pembrolizumab, nivolum ab combination with cobimetinib, and dabrafenib in combination with trametinib seem to have a higher probability of good performanc e for overall survival than monotherapies with a BRAF inhibitor or a trametinib, and vemurafenib in combination with cobimetinib seem to have a higher probability of good performance for progr ession free survival than the immunotherapies, as well as the monotherapies of BRAF - and MEK inhibitors. Ipilimumab has poorer progression free survival tha n monotherapies of the BRAF inhibitors, as well as t he BRAF inhibitors in combinat ion with a MEK inhibitor. Pembrolizumab og nivolumab seem to have a higher pro bability of fewer serious adverse events than monot herapies of the BRAF inhibito rs, as well as the BRAF inhibitors in combination with a MEK inhibitor. We have no results from network meta-analyses for health related quality of life. Comparisons of the effica cy for the BRAF/MEK inhibitors The combination treatments with a BFRA inhibitor and a MEK inhi bitor seem to have higher probability of good performance for overall surviva l and progression free survival than the monotherapi es. For serious adverse event s we could not establish any differences betwee n the combination treatments an d the monotherapies. For health related quality of life, we have only results from a pairwise comparison (dabrafenib in combination with tramentinib versus vemurafenib) , which reported better health related quality of life in the combination group. 100 Discussion Comparisons of the efficacy for the immunotherapies Nivolumab and pembrolizumab seem to have higher probability of good performance for overall surviva l, progression free survival and serious adverse events than ipilimumab in monotherapy. Nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab seem to have higher probability of good performance for overall survival and progression free survival than ipilimumab in monotherapy. For s erious adverse events we could not establish any d ifferences between the combination treatment and ipilimumab in monotherapy. We have no results from network meta -analyses for health related qua lity of life. Of the endpoints studied in this health te chnology assessment, we consider overall survival to be of higher importance than progression free survival, since progression free survival is a surrogate endpoint. However, health related quality of life and seri- ous adverse events are also of great importance for these patients. From the in- cluded trials we were not able to find data usable for our analyses for health related quality of life, and the quality of the evidence for serious adverse events were mostly low and very low. In this health technology assessment we also included the two MEK inhibitors cobi- metinib and trametinib, the first without ma rketing approval in Norway at time of writing. According to the literature, the ME K inhibitors may have the potential to re- duce the resistance seen to BRAF inhibitors (15, 45). Our results show that the com- bination of a BRAF inhibitor and a MEK in hibitor comes out better than the same drugs used as monotherapy, both for over all survival and progression free survival, while the monotherapies of th e BRAF inhibitors may have a similar number of seri- ous adverse events as compared to the combination treatment. Economic evaluation The economic model predicts a median su rvival of about 12.5 months for ipili- mumab and about 19 months for the new immunotherapies. The immunotherapies in monotherapy have quite similar expected drug costs per patient, with ipilimumab demonstrating the lowest expected cumula tive drug cost. Ipilimumab in combina- tion with nivolumab have higher expected drug costs per patient than either alterna- tive in monotherapy. The administration co sts for parenteral based drugs are higher than for the peroral drugs, but stil l low relative to the drug cost. The median survival for the BRAF/MEK mo notherapies are about 11 months and for the combination therapies, 17.5 months. The differences in costs between the BRAF/MEK interventions are more pron ounced compared to the immunother- aphies. The administration costs are very low for the peroral based therapies. Generally, all the interventions have very high incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. We are not allowed to refer to discounts from the maximum pharmacy retail price 101 Discussion that may already have been achieved through the Drug Procurement Cooperation system (LIS). We therefore used the maximu m pharmacy retail price in this analysis and the ranking of the interventions as well as the budget impacts may change as a result of price changes. The first analysis includes all the interventions included in the network meta-analy- sis. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab in monoth erapy clusters together in the cost-ef- fectiveness plane, for similar levels of costs and effectiveness, but at a noticeably higher effectiveness than ipilimumab in monotheraphy or any of the BRAF/MEK in- hibitors in monotherapy. The BRAF/MEK combination therapies have about the same effectiveness, but higher costs co mpared with nivolumab and pembrolizumab and the combination nivolumab in combin ation with ipilimum Nivolumab and the cobi metinib are the two undominated strate- gies the analysis. Nivolumab has an incremental effe ct of 0.82 quality adjusted life years and an incremental cost -effectiveness ratio against dacarbazine of about 1.1 million NOK per quality adjusted life year gained. The combination vemu- rafenib and cobimetinib has an incremental effectiveness of 0.07 quality adjusted life years and an incremental cost-effective ness ratio of about 19.8 million NOK per quality adjusted life year gained against nivolumab. In the cost-effectiveness accept- ability curves, nivolumab and pembrolizumab have quite similar levels of iterations being cost effective. When we restrict the analysis to the BRAF /MEK inhibitors, dabrafenib and the com- bination vemurafenib and cobimetinib are the two undominated strategies. Dabraf-enib has an incremental effect of 0.36 qual ity adjusted life years and an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio compared to daca rbazine of approximately NOK 2.2 million per quality adjusted life year gained. Th e combination vemurafenib and cobimetinib has an incremental effect of 0.53 quality adjusted life years and incremental cost-ef- fectiveness ratio compared to dabrafenib of about NOK 2.9 million per quality ad- justed life year gained. In the cost-effectiveness acceptability curves, the BRAF/MEK monotheraphies have a higher probability of being cost-effective for the lowest will- ingness to pay values, and the combination strategies show an increasing trend for very high willingness to pay values. Th e BRAF and MEK inhibitor monotherapies (dabrafenib, vemurafenib, trametinib) all ha ve very similar costs and effectiveness. The same applies to the BRAF/MEK combin ations (dabrafenib and trametinib or vemurafenib and cobimetinib), but at a higher level of costs and effectiveness. When the analysis is limited to the immuno therapies, nivolumab is still the only un- dominated intervention. Both nivolumab and pembrolizumab have very similar ef- fectiveness and costs, and we cannot conclude which one of these interventions are more cost-effective. The combination nivo lumab and ipilimumab have higher costs than nivolumab in monotherapy and about the same effectiveness as nivolumab and pembrolizumab in monotherapy. In the co st-effectiveness acceptabilility curves, 102 Discussion nivolumab and pembrolizumab are clearly separable from the other strategies with respect to the percentage of it erations being cost-effective. The scatterplots indicates much uncertaintly in the results, particularly for effective- ness. The expected value of partial perfect information analysis identified the effi- cacy data used in the model as the domina ting source of parameter uncertainty, fol- lowed by health related quality of life data, costs and seriou s advers events. The choice of time horizon (5 yrs versus 10 yrs) or quality-of-life weights (SG versus EQ-5D) does not seem to influence the rankin g of the alternatives in this analysis. The structural uncertainty surrounding ho w to model the treatment with nivolumab and pembrolizumab was investigated in a scenario analysis. Our base case cost esti- mates for the immunotherapies are independent of the transition probability from progressive free survival to progressed disease, and is closest to a scenario that as- sumes that 100% of those in progression fr ee survival at 24 months, will be treated for another 12 months. The maximum pharmacy retail price would ha ve to be reduced by approximately 63- 84%, depending on drug, in order to obtain incremental cost-effectiveness ratios rel- ative to dacarbazine of 500,000 NOK per qual ity adjusted life year gained. For such price reductions, the annual budgetary sa vings could be about NOK 277 million and the accumulated budgetary savings over a 5 year period NOK 1,387 million. Overall summary of results None of the interventions included in th e systematic review and economic evalua- tion are cost effective at the maximum pharmacy retail prices. The budgetary impact and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios can however be reduced through price re- ductions. Drug price reductions from the ma ximum pharmacy retail prices in the re- gion of 63-84%, are necessary in order fo r the new interventions to represent more cost-effective use of resources in the Norwegian health sector. The results from the network meta-analyses indicates that in addition to nivolumab and pembrolizumab, the combination trea tments and cobimetinib; and dabrafenib in combination with trametinib seems to have a higher probability of g ood performance than the other available treatment strategies for overall survival. Fo r progression free surv ival dabrafenib in combination with trametinib, and vemura fenib in combinatio n with cobimetinib seems to have a higher probability of g ood performance than the other available treatment strategies. In Norway, health care decisions are not ne cessarlily linked to a defined threshold value. All the estimated incremental cost-effect iveness ratios in this analysis are very high, and represents a challenge for any de cision maker that aims to prioritise 103 Discussion within a fixed health care budget. Allocati ng resources to these interventions with- out price reductions may pote ntially inflict on other interventions or treatment areas in the health sector and lead to a net health loss. Quality of the clinical evidence We assessed the quality of the evidence for overall survival, progression free sur- vival and serious adverse events for all the comparisons with direct evidence. By do- ing so we have also assessed the quality for the loops the indirect evidence consist of. The quality of the indirect evidence was equal to the lowest quality of the compar-isons in that loop. The quality of the co mbined evidence from the network meta- analyses are based upon the highest quality obtained from the respective direct and indirect assessments. We did these assess ments by using the GRADE approach for network meta-analyses. For overall survival and progression free survival we assessed the quality of the evi- dence to be moderate or high for the majo rity of our assessme nts. For serious ad- verse events we assessed the quality to be low or very low in most of our assess- ments. Due to insufficient data we were not able to use the GRADE method for the endpoint health related quality of life. The main reasons for downgrading were weaknesses associated with the study de- sign and imprecise results. We downgraded for study design for the seven trials that allowed the participants randomized to the control group to cross over to the inter- vention group after progression. This had im plicationfor overall survival and serious adverse events. The downgradings for imprecision were because the 95% confiden- tial interval was wide and included null effect and/or few events. As shown in the Summary of Findings Tables in Appendix 8, the downgrading for imprecision were used for all the endpoints, but has mo st impact for serious adverse events. Strengths and weaknesses of this report Clinical effectiveness Strengths We only included randomized controlled tria ls to assess clinical effectiveness. We identified trials from our systematic literature search, and we also asked the manu- factures to provide relevant literature that we had not identified. We received an ad- ditional five full text articles and nine abst racts/posters. Some of this additional lit- erature was not present in the databases at the time of our search for literature. All the interventions could be included in our network meta-analyses. 104 Discussion Our clinical endpoints were all well-defined and harmonized in their definitions. A few trials did not define some of the endp oints, or they may differ slightly, but the trials that reported an explicit definition of the endpoint, did it in the same way. Overall survival was defined specifically as the time from randomization to death from any cause. Progression free survival was defined as the time from randomiza- tion to the earliest date disease progressi on or death due to any cause. Progression free survival was assessed by the investigator (14 of 15 trials), and confirmed by an independent review committee in eight of the trials (in one study progression was only assessed by the independent review co mmittee). Health related quality of life was measured by the same instrument (EORTC-QLQ-C30) in all the nine trials re- porting this outcome. Serious adverse events were graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.for the majority of the trials. As a consequence, the trials reported the adverse events in the same way, by splitting the adverse events in the same way using grade groups from 1 to 4 (or in a few cases four or hi gher, i.e. including group 5). We have in- cluded serious adverse events reported as grade 3 and 4 (and 5 if reported). Overall survival was measured with up to 3 years follow-up for two comparisons: dabrafenib versus dacarbazine (56) and da brafenibin combinatio n with trametinib versus dabrafenib (52, 63), and up to five years for the comparison ipilimumab in combination with dacarbazine versus dacarb azine (50). The results from these anal- yses did not differ substantially from earlie r reports measuring OS up to two years. For overall survival and progression free survival the results of the pairwise esti- mates performed in RevMan and network me ta-analyses are consistent. That is, the results from network meta-analyses and pa irwise comparisons are similar in magni- tude and direction. For serious adverse ev ents the results from the pairwise esti- mates performed in RevMan and network meta-analyses are consistent when it comes to the ability to conclude, but the es timated direction of th e difference relative to dacarbazine seems to differ between the pairwise comparisons and the network-meta-analysis for vemurafenib and dabrafenib (for neither of the treaments, neither the pairwise comparisons nor the network meta-analysis could establish a difference relative to dacarbazine). Weaknesses Due to insufficient data we could not perform network meta-analysis for health re-lated quality of life, hence we were not able to draw any conclusions for the relative efficacy of the interventions for this endpoint. However, four trials reported better health related quality of life in the intervention group as compared to the control group (d abrafenib versus daca rbazine, trametinib versus dacarbazine/paclitaxel, dabrafenib in combinatio n with trametinib versus vemurafenib respectively). 105 Discussion Seven of the trials allowed patients in the control group to cross over to the interven- tion group after progression. The statistical analyses of the endpoint overall survival was based on the intention to treat population in all seven trials, i.e. the analyses were done without taking the crossover into account. By doing this, the assumption underlying the statistical analysis is that crossover does not alter mortality patterns. In one of the publications, this was pointe d out as a weakness (11). However, we de- cided to include these data since the results for the intervention will not be favoured. One of the trials that allowed cross over of patients from the control group to the in- tervention group did, however, present re sults from both analyses where partici- pants who crossed over were censored at the time of cross-over, and analyses with- out censoring (61). In our network meta-ana lyses we only included the data without censoring at time of cross ov er, since this was what we had for all the other trials. Economic evaluation Strengths We based the economic evaluation on a thor ough systematic review of the literature and network meta-analysis to inform th e treatment effects and serious adverse events in the model. We included a wide spectrum of relevant co sts from the health care perspective with close assistance of experts in the field. We have used a well-known three-health state probabilistic Markov model design used by many other economic evaluations within the cancer field, which utilizes the most important clinical endpoi nt, the effect on overall su rvival. The output from the probabilistic model provides information re levant for the decision uncertainty and on what parameters more research should be directed. Weaknesses We did not have individual-level state histor y data to inform our transition probabil- ities, and the randomized controlled trial data we used were not from a Norwegian patient population. The analysis is dependent on the validity of the baseline overall survival and progression-free-survival func tions, and the estimation of transition probabilities from aggregate data may have introduced errors. There is uncertainty with regards to the correct treatment duration in the model, both for the new immunotherapies and th e BRAF/MEK inhibitors. For the latter, the treatment duration is sensitive to time in the progression free health state. See Table 45 for an overview of median treatment durations in the model. We are extrapolating the effectiveness data beyond the clinical trial follow-up period for nivolumab, nivolumab in combinatio n with ipilimumab, pembrolizumab and vemurafenib in combination with cobimetini b. Use of the hazard ratio in our model 106 Discussion assumes constant proportional hazards. Altough the assump tion is assumed to hold for the study follow-up period in the pair wise comparisons and in the network meta- analysis, the extrapolation increases the unce rtainty regarding the validity of this as- sumption. The results are dependent on strong a ssumptions regarding treatment efficacy across different subgroups. Analysis one and three rests on the assumption that the treatment effects of the immunotherapies are the same regardless of BRAF status. For the BRAF/MEK inhibitors in analysis tw o, we assume that past treatment with immunotherapy not influence the treatment effects. We have however not found in- dications in our material that rejects these assumptions. Differences between the drugs with respect to survival before and after progression are not captured in our model. The assumption of equal overall survival, before and after progression may generally overestima te the mortality before progression and underestimate the mortality after pr ogression, for all interventions. Important differences between the interven tions regarding patien ts health related quality of life may not have been captured in our analysis, due to very limited evi- dence on health related quality of li fe of the alternative interventions. The unit prices were generally drawn from official price tariffs or hospital diagnosis related groups with the assumption that the reimbursemen t covers 100% of the cost of the health care provision. We also a ssumed that all costs we re gamma distributed with the point estimate as the mean and the standard error 0.5 times the mean. Both assumptions may lead to underestimation or overestimation of actual costs. Our results compared to other fi ndings/other reviews or results To our knowledge a relative comparison for all the different new drugs used for in-operable or metastatic malignant melanoma patients has not been done by any oth- ers, neither for effectiveness nor for cost-effectiveness. The Norwegian Medicines Agency (NMA), Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technol- ogies in Health (CADTH), an d National Institute for Heal th and Clinical Excellence (NICE), have performed single technology assessments on drugs used for metastatic melanoma. This has been done for dabr afenib mumab in in previous treated patients (18-20)(NMA, CADTH, NICE), ipilimumab in previous un treated patients (indirect comparisons to dacarbazine, vemurafeni b and 24)(NICE, CADTH). In our health technology assessment we have included all the 107 Discussion trials used in these assessments. None of these assessments has compared all the different new drugs for advanced metastatic malignant melanoma patients relatively to each other. We have therefore conducted this health technology assessment in-cluding all the new drugs for these patients in a Norwegian setting to be able to iden- tify which intervention is most cost-effective. We have chosen not to explicitly compare our incremental cost-effectiveness results with the results of other published single technology assessments. Any such compar- ison would be highly dependent on how data on clinical effectiven ess was used in the model, structural assumptions in the decisi on model and differences in cost data. 108 Conclusion Conclusion Relative effectiveness for seven new drug s used for advanced malignant melanoma patients have been synthesized in a systematic review including 17 randomized con- trolled trials presented in 40 publications. ipilimumab, nivoluma are used as monotherapy or in combination with each other. We have used both direct and indirect evidence and performed network meta-an- lyses for each clinical endpoint which allo ws a ranking of the different interventions relative to each other. The cost-effectiveness analysis were based on the maximum pharmacy retail prices for the new interventions. We are not allo wed to refer to discounts from the maxi- mum pharmacy retail price that may have been achieved through the Drug Procure-ment Cooperation system (LIS), because the contracts are not open to the public. None of the interventions are cost-effective at the maximum pharmacy retail prices. The budgetary impact of accepting some or all of the new interventions in clinical practice can be substantial, potentially diverting resources away from other inter- ventions or treatment areas with better cost-effectiveness. The budgetary impact and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios can however be reduced through price reduc-tions. We believe that drug price reductions in the region of 63 to 84 percent, de- pending on drug, would be necessary for the interventions to represent cost-effective use of resources in the Norwegian setting. We find it difficult to separate the new immunotherapies nivolumab and pembroli- zumab in monotherapy with respect to cost -effectiveness. If these new immunother- aphies are accepted in clinical practice, we expect increased effectiveness compared to ipilimumab in monotherapy, but at an increased cost. The potential budgetary savings with price reductions from the ma ximum pharmacy retail price may be as high as NOK 131 million per year. Based on the cost-effectiveness results, we cannot argue that any of the BRAF or MEK inhibitor monotherapies (dabrafenib, ve murafenib, trametinib), should be pre- 109 Conclusion ferred over another, or that any BRAF/MEK combination (dabrafenib and tramet- inib or vemurafenib and cobimetinib), shou ld be preferred over another. However, the combination therapies are more likely to give the highest quality adjusted life year gains in the long run. For the BRAF/MEK inhibitors, the potential budgetary savings with price reductions may be as high as NOK 147 million per year. All conclusions are given with respect to the current state of the evidence and with the reservation that new evidence from randomized controlled trials can change the ranking of the interventions, both with regards to effectiveness and cost-effective- ness (one of the interventions still do not have marketing authorization). Need for further research The sensitivity analysis showed that the cl inical effectiveness data is the most influental source of uncertainty, followed by health related quality of life data, costs and the relative risks for serious adverse events. It is expensive to conduct or to co-finance randomized controlled trials. However, it is worthwile conducting more research if the value of added information reduces the decision uncertainty, and the expected re turns exceeds the costs of the research. It is a need for more research to confirm the studies available comparing the interventions directly on subgroups of the advanced malignant melanoma population on health related quality of life longer-term trials both for monotherapie s and combination therapies for efficacy (to follow development of resistance for the BRAF inhibitors and safety) on optimal treatment time for the different drugs and combination of drugs on the optimal sequence of the alternative treatments combination of drugs with diffe rent mechanisms of actions 110 References 1.
