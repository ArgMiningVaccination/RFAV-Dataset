Essential oils are volatile oily substances that are extracted by various ways from plants. The compounds contained in essential oils are fat soluble and are very compatible with body tissue. They can be used externally and in some cases internally as well. Although essential oils are mostly known for use in aromatherapy for affecting moods and alleviating tension and stress, they are also used to help the body heal itself for many conditions such as sinusitis, bronchitis, allergies, pain, hypertension, menopause symptoms, cancer, and more. How do you store essential oils? Keep oils stored in dark colored glass bottles (not plastic) in a cool, dry place tightly closed. How long do oils stay fresh? Oils usually stay good for at least 2-4 years. Refrigeration extends shelf life. Do you have wholesale pricing for retailers? Yes, all prices are discounted up to 40% for retailers. Please contact Carol for retail discount code. You must provide your resale number and a copy of resale certificate. Is there a limit on how long an essential oil should be used? To maintain effectiveness and to give your body a break if using the same essential oils daily, stop use after 3 weeks of daily use for 1 week. Then recommence use. Reduce chances of acquiring sensitivity reaction from constant use of the same oil over the years by varying choices. How many different ways can essential oils be administered? There are three basic ways that the oils are administered. One, via the skin by applying the oil the skin or the soles of the feet in diluted form; two, through the respiratory system, where you inhale the vapors of the oils from your hands, through diffusion of the oils into the air, or via a nasal inhaler; and three, through the digestive tract, where you take the oils orally, in diluted form, as advised and monitored by a professional. And they can be introduced to the body in combination, such as in a bath where you get the benefit of the oils through skin absorption and by inhalation. Why use blends as opposed to single oils? Just as there is synergy between single oil components that render the whole essential powerful, when 2 or more specially selected oils are combined the synergy between them provides a more powerful effect than the single oil alone. Are there any essential oils that are harmful? Special care needs to be taken if you are pregnant, have epilepsy, hypertension or any medical condition as there could be adverse reactions to certain oils so seek advice from a trained professional aromatherapist. If you have any medical condition or symptoms, see your medical doctor for proper diagnoses and treatment. True toxic or poisonous essential oils are not sold to the general public. What makes these oils different from prescription medicines? The oils are complete or whole. The allopathic way is to extract the chemical constituent of the plant for specific use. For example, antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, antiinfectious, immunostimulant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, properties may be contained in one plant and thus one essential oil, as in the case of tea tree oil. The clinical aromatherapy way is to keep all the chemical constituents of the essential oil complete as they are presented in nature. Components of essential oils work synergistically for best results. The allopathic way would be to separate out the chemical constituents to deal with one symptom or pathology. There is the phenomena of quenching whereby the potential unwanted results of one component in an essential oil are cancelled out by the natural presence of other components. In other words, a \"hazardous\" component does not automatically render the whole essential oil unsafe. This shows the importance of using the natural synergistic composition of whole oils rather than isolates. The concept of quenching is also used in blending oils. As presented in Aromatherapy for Health Professionals, Eucalyptus globulus and E. smithii (another type of eucalyptus) both contain approximately 65% of 1,8-cineole which although greatly effective for infection, is also a skin irritant. Yet because of the quenching aspects of components in E. smithii, it is not irritating to the skin and safe enough to be used on children whereas Eucalyptus globules is a skin irritant. An example using the quenching phenomena in blending would be to combine oil of oregano with lavender. Alone oregano oil is very hot and caustic. Combined with lavender, it can be used as a non-irritating highly effective fungicide that does not burn. For the most part, you will find that essential oils do not cause as many side effects as prescriptions drugs SAFETY 1) Essential oils do not dissolve in water. They must be diluted with some type of vegetable oil. 2) Essential oils, in their concentrated state, with few exceptions, should never come in contact with skin or mucous membranes. Tea tree oil is one exception. Seek advice from an expert about applying neat (undiluted) oils to skin. Oils should always be diluted if using over a large area of the body. 3) Never add undiluted essential oils to bath water. Add the essential oil to a bath salt, egg, milk or bath gel first and then add it to the bath water. This promotes dispersion of the oil. 4) Generally, allergic people should use essential oils with caution. The least sensitive area is the soles of the feet. 5) Citrus oils can cause skin sensitization when the skin is exposed to the sun after application. Avoid exposing the treated skin area to the sun for at least 12 hours after application. Exceptions to this rule- if essential oil has been steam distilled. 6) Some oils have very strong caustic characteristics and should be used very cautiously, generally in diluted form. 7) Essential oils rich in menthol should not be used near the neck or throat of children under 18 months. 8) Care must be taken to keep essential oil bottles tightly closed, out of the reach of children, and preferably in a cool place out of direct sunlight. 9) Taking essential oils orally requires oils of impeccable quality and under the supervision of an appropriately trained doctor or therapist.
