Following a merger with Northeast Health (Samaritan , Albany Memorial and Sunnyview Rehabilitation Hospitals ) and Seton Health (St. Mary's Hospital) in October 2011, St. Peter's Hospital is now part of St. Peter's Health Partners (SPHP). With near ly 12,500 employee s in more than 165 locations, SPHP is the largest and most comprehensive not -for-profit network of high -quality, advanced medical care, primary care, rehabilitation, and senior services in the region. SPHP is a member of Trinity Health, one of the largest health care systems in the countr y. At St. Peter's, caring for the community dates back to the principles established by the foundress of the Religious Sisters of Mercy, Catherine McAuley. In 1824, at the age of 50, she inherited a large fortune and used the money to build a large house in Dublin, Ireland. It became the first House of Mercy \u2014and was the home where Catherine and several other women provided educational, religious and social services for women and children who were poor, homeless and in need. Carrying on that mission, four Sisters of Mercy founded St. Peter's Hospital in do wntown Albany, NY, on November 1, 1869 . Today St. Peter's serves nearly 4,000 people every day with comprehensive medical services, free educational programs and a host of community health screenings throughout the region. St. Peter's is a Magnet Hospital for Nursing, a Top 100 Cardiovascular Hospital and a Designated Heart and Stroke Emergency Center. Recent awards include the Blue Distinction Award for Treatment of Complex and Rare Cancers, and Women's Choice Awards for Heart Care and Obstetrics. MISSION STATEMENT \"We, St. Peter's Health Partners and Trinity Health, serve together in the spirit of the gospel as a compassionate and transforming healing presence within our communities. Founded in community - based legacies of compassionate healing, we provide the highest quality comprehensive continuum of integrated health care, supportive housing and community services, especially for the needy and vulnerable.\" St. Peter's Health Partners' Mission guides everything we do. As we continue our healing ministry into the 21st century, we are called to both serve others and transform care delivery. We reinvest our resources back into the community through new technologies, vital health services, and access for everyone regardless of their circumstances. We call our commitment to the community \"Community Health and Well- Being Ministry.\" Community benefit is an organized and measured approach to meeting community health needs. It implies collaboration with a \"community\" to \"benefit\" its residents by improving health status and quality of life. In our communities, St. Peter's H ealth Partners' many community health programs are restoring wholeness and well -being to people. Year after year, St. Peter's Health Partners reinvests in communities with funding for charity care, 3 primary care services, screenings, education, and research. And the commitment has risen in proportion to the needs. Definition and Brief Description of the Community Served For the purposes of the Community Health Needs Assessment, St. Peter's Hospital defines its service area as Albany and Rensselaer Count ies which represent the home zip codes of 64 % of its patients. Albany Rensselaer Population 309,606 159,906 % White 93% 91% Median Household Income $60,414 $59,516 Much m ore information about the community socio demographi cs is contained in Section II. Review of the Previous Community Health Needs Assessment (2013) Key findings of the 2013 CHNA included issues pertaining to Behavioral Health and Chronic Disease. Asthma and Diabetes were the specific health conditions within chronic disease that were selected to be addressed. Asthma in particular was selected due to the significant disparities evident among sub - populations. Behavioral Health: Area providers identified a service gap in the system with regard to tobacco and opiate abuse. The taskforce designed strategies to improve provider knowledge regarding: recognizing signs of abuse, discussing treatment options with addicts, and appropriate opiate prescriptions. We pr omoted colocation of services by bringing behavioral health professionals into the primary care setting to assist in this endeavor. Following the lead of the CDC, strategies 4 regarding tobacco cessation included incorporating cessation programs into overall mental health treatment and encouraging mental health facilities and campuses to enact tobacco -free policies. o Worked with seven actively engaged large behavioral health providers to institute tobacco free grounds, train clinical staff on evidenced based best practices and implement tobacco use policies o Over 400 individuals attended smoking cessation classes; Nearly 2,500 individuals were referred to the NYS Quit Line by SPHP hospitals and physician practices o Over 2,200 individuals were trained in delivery of Naloxone/Narcan to prevent heroin overdosing and sudden death o 2000 I -Care (Information and Resources for I -STOP prescribers) brochures were printed and distributed to opio id prescribers(also available electronically) o Dozens of locations participated in regularly scheduled drug \"take back\" days to remove opioids from consumer's homes. Diabetes: Our plan focused on reaching disparate communities to decrease the prevalence of diabetes and assist those currently living with the disease. Strategy tactics ad vanced a \"Health in All Policies\" approach. We worked to expand school and employee wellness programs and open public areas to the public for safe physical activity in order to meet individuals where they live, work and play. Lifestyle change and self- man agement strategies were promoted to significantly improve quality of life and reduce treatment costs for those with diabetes. Creating a diabetes services resource guide (in both English and Spanish) for health care providers and consumers helped to build and strengthen partnerships that align to improve diabetes care. These strategies helped to foster an environment that engages individuals in prevention and self- management of diabetes. o Sodium in food prepared in the cafeteria at two of the SPHP hospitals was reduced by at least 12% affecting staff, visitors, students and contractors. o SPHP Employee Wellness program instituted affecting all 12,500 employees. o 5000 Diabetes Resource guides were printed and distributed to providers and consumers (also available electronically) Asthma: In the past three years, we worked to reduce the prevalence of uncontrolled asthma in high prevalence neighborhoods. The focus was on increasing the number of patients engaged in an asthma continuum of care and increasing the utilization of asthma action plans and controller medication. Strategies promoted community environments in enacting tobacco -free policies and engaging the community in smoking cessation programs. o Implemented lung centers associated with three of the SPHP emergency departments providing enhanced asthma/respiratory care to an average of 75 patients per month o SPHP instituted a free Asthma Education Project in targeted neighborhoods designed to provide patients and families with information to help manage childhood asthma. Skilled Community Health Workers meet with families in their homes to help them learn about asthma signs and symptoms, identify causes of asthma and provide tools to help them manage their child's asthma. o Our work with community agencies resulted in numerous communities implementing tobacco free parks and two housing authorities representing nearly 4,500 units becoming tobacco free. Albany County passed a 21 year old minimum purchase age of tobacco products. 5 Written Comments on Prior CHNA The CHNA is well known in our community . Local health departments , as well as numerous community based agencies , have been involved throughout the process of selecting priorities and developing improvement plans. No specific written comments have been received. Community Health Needs Assessment 2016 St. Peter's Hospital, along with its in SPHP sister hospitals, collaborated with other local health systems, county health departments and community based agencies to complete a six county (Albany, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga, Columbia and Greene) Community Health Needs Assessment, led by the Healthy Capital District Initiative (HCDI). HCDI is an incorporated not for profit which works with others in the community to determine ways in which the c apital region could be more effective in identifying and addressing public health problems. For the purposes of its CHNA, St. Peter's used data and information from this assessment relating to Albany and Rensselaer Counties which represent the home zip cod es of 64% of its patients. Other health systems will be addressing the needs of remaining counties in the assessment based on their location and patient population. Data The health indicators selected for this report were based on a review of available public health data and New York State priorities promulgated through the Prevention Agenda for a Healthier New York . Upon examination of these key resources, identification of additional indicators of importance with data available, and discussion with public health as well as health care professionals in the Capital Region, it was decided that building upon the 2013 -2018 Prevention Agenda would provide the most comprehensive analysis of available public health needs and behaviors for the Region. The collection and management of these data has been supported by the state for an extended period of time and are very likely to continue to be supported. This provides us with both reliable and comparable data over time and across the state. These measures, when complimented by the recent Expanded Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and Prevention Quality Indicators, provide health indicators that can be potentially impacted i n the short -term. This is a distinct step forward over mortality data leading public health efforts in the past. The Finger Lakes Health Systems Agency provided SPARCS (hospitalizations and ED visits) and Vital Statistics Data Portals that were utilized to generate county and ZIP code level analyses of mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency room utilization, for all residents, by gender, race and ethnicity. The timeframes used for the z ip code analyses were 2009 -2013 Vital Statistics and 2010 -2014 Sta tewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) data. The 5 -year period was chosen to establish more reliable rates when looking at small geographic areas or minority populations. Additional data was examined from a wide variety of sources: Prevention Agenda 2013 -18 indicators Community Health Indicator Reports (2011 -20130 County Health Assessment Indicators (2011 -2013) County Health Indicators by Race/Ethnicity (2011 -2013) 6 County Perinatal Profiles (2011- 2013) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillan ce System (BRFSS) and Expanded BRFSS (2013 -14) Cancer Registry, New York State (2010 -2012) Prevention Quality Indicators (2011 -2013) Communicable Disease Annual Reports (2011 -2013) The Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System (PedNSS) (2010 -2012) Student Weight Status Category Reporting System (2010- 2014) New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services Data Warehouse (2007 -2014) Conference of Local Mental Health directors Behavioral Health Information Portal (2013) Hospital -Acquired Infect ion Reporting System (2010- 2013) NYS Child Health Lead Poisoning Prevention Program ( 2010 birth cohort; 2011- 2013) NYS Kids' Well- being Indicator Clearinghouse (KWIC) (2011, 2014) County Health Rankings (2016) American Fact Finder (factfinder2.census.gov) (2009 -2013) Bureau of Census, American Community Survey (2009 -2013) These data sources were supplemented by a Siena Community Health Survey. The 2016 Community Health Survey was conducted from February to March 2016 by the Siena Collage Research Institut e. The survey was a random digit dial telephone survey of adult (18+ years) residents for each of the six counties (n= 400 per county; 2,400 for Capital Region). Cell phones and landlines were both utilized for the survey. This consumer survey was conducted to learn about the health needs and concerns of residents in the Capital Region. For a detailed summary of the findings, consult the Appendix . Local data were compiled from these data sources and draft reports were prepared by health condition for inclusion in this community health needs assessment. Drafts were reviewed for accuracy and thoroughness by two staff with specialized health knowledge: Kevin Jobin- Davis, Ph.D. who has over 15 years of public health data analysis experience in the Capital Reg ion; and Michael Medvesky, M.P.H. who has over 35 years of experience working with public health data in the New York State Department of Health in many roles including Director of the Public Health Information Group. Drafts of the sections were sent to local subject matter experts for review in the health departments of Albany, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga, Columbia and Greene Counties and in St. Peter's Health Partners, Albany Medical Center, Ellis Hospital, Saratoga Hospital and Columbia Memorial. C omments were addressed and changes were incorporated into the final document. Collaborative Partners Engaging the community in the health needs assessment process was a priority of St. Peter's Health Partners . Broad community engagement began with the community health survey. The surveys offered multiple choice and open ended questions to learn about residents' health needs, health behaviors and 7 barriers to care. Demographic information collected by the survey allowed review of information by age, gender, race/ethnicity and income. Survey results were incorporated into the examination of health needs by the members of the 4 Capital Region Public Health Prioritization Workgroups (Albany -Rensselaer, Columbia-Gree ne, Saratoga and Schenectady). The Workgroups included community voices through representatives from consumers, community organizations that serve low income residents, the homeless, those with HIV/AIDS, advocacy groups, employers, public health department s, providers and health insurers. Participants were encouraged to share data of their own and to advocate for the needs of their constituents. Prioritization Process Selection of the top health priorities for the Capital Region was based on a multi -year process building on existing knowledge from present Community Health Improvement Plan/Community Service Plan implementation efforts, as well as the 2015 Medicaid Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) Needs Assessment. A Capital Region Prevention Agenda Steering Committee was formed to guide the 2016 Public Health Prioritization process, and Plan development. Meetings were held during Fall/Winter 2015 -2016 with participation from the local health departments of Albany, Columbia, Greene, Renssel aer, Saratoga and Schenectady counties, St. Peter's Health Partners, Ellis Medicine, Albany Medical Center, Saratoga Hospital, Columbia Memorial Hospital and HCDI to ensure that health needs analysis, prioritization and community health plans were timely and of high quality. Members of these organizations worked to identify individuals to participate in the Capital Region Public Health Prioritization Workgroups. The Public Health Prioritization Workgroups were formed to review data analyses prepared by HCDI and to select the top two priorities and one disparity to be addressed. Data presentations were given at the meetings to summarize available data on the leading problems in each of the Workgroup's service areas. Health indicators were included in the Prioritization data presentations if: At least one of the county rates was significantly higher than the New York State rate, excluding New York City data; or At least one of the county rates was in the highest risk quartile in the state; or Rates for the health condition worsened over the past decade for one of the counties; or The health condition was a leading cause of death for one of the counties; or Disparity between rates was clearly evident in sub -populations; or There were a high absolute number of cases in the counties. Health indicators that met the criteria were included in the data presentations for each of the five Prevention Agenda Priority Areas: Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment Prevent Chronic Diseases Prevent HIV/STDs, Vaccine Preventable Diseases and Healthcare -Associated Infections, Promote Healt hy Women, Infants, and Children Promote Mental Health and Prevent Substance Abuse. A total of 90 New York State health indicators across the 5 Prevention Agenda Priority Areas were prese nted. Available data on prevalence, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, mortality and 8 trends were included for each indicator. Equity data for gender, age, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood groupings were presented as available. After the presen tation of each set of health indicators, a discussion was held to answer any questions or for individuals to share their experiences with the health condition in the population. Participants did a preliminary vote on the importance of the condition in the community based on three qualitative dimensions: the impact of the condition on quality of life and cost of health care; community awareness and concern about the condition; and the opportunity to prevent or reduce the burden of this hea lth issue on the co mmunity. Participants were provided with a Prioritization Tracking Tool to record their own comments and measure their thoughts on the severity, community values, and opportunity regarding each health indicator. Upon completion of the data summaries, th e Workgroup members were given an opportunity to advocate for the priority they believed was most meritorious and the group voted on the top two Prevention Agenda categories. Behavioral health and chronic disease categories received the greatest amount of votes by far because they impact the largest number of people in the most significant ways, both directly and indirectly, through their influence on other health conditions. They also contributed most significantly to the cost of health care. Albany -Rensselaer Public Health Priority Workgroup The Albany Rensselaer Public Health Priority Workgroup was spearheaded by the Albany County Health Department, the Rensselaer County Health Department, Albany Medical Center, and St. Peter 's Health Partners. Because the hospitals catchment areas covered both counties, it was felt a joint -county Workgroup was appropriate. Three meetings were held on February 10, February 24, and March 18, 2016. During these meetings, HCDI presented heath indicators f or each of the 5 Prevention agenda Priority Areas, and facilitated Workgroup discussions. The Power Point data presentations used during these meetings were made available to the Workgroup members and the general public on the HCDI Website ( http://www.hcdiny.org/ ). The Workg roup cho se their priorities at the last Workgroup meeting. Organizations participating in the Albany -Rensselaer Public Health Priority Workgroup include: - Albany County Department of Health - Alban y County Department of Social Services - Albany County Department of Mental Health - Albany Medical Center - Albany Medical Center: DSRIP - Albany Police Department - Albany Rensselaer Cancer Program - University at Albany School of Public Health - Alzheimer's Association - Belvedere Health Services, LLC - Berkshire Farm Center & Youth Services - Capital District Childcare Coordinating Council - Capital District Physicians' Health Plan (CDPHP) - Capital District Psychiatric Center - Office of Mental Health - Capital Distri ct Tobacco -Free Coalition - Capital District Transportation Committee - Capital District YMCA - Capitol Region BOCES 9 - Care Coordination Services - Catholic Charities - Catholic Charities: Commuity Maternity Services - Center for Disability Services - Colonie Senior Services Centers - Commission for Economic Opportunity - Community Care Behavioral Health Organization - Conifer Park - Fidelis Care Network - Hometown Health Centers - Hospitality House - Independent Living Center of the Hudson Valley - Interfaith Partnership - Jewish Fami ly Services of Northeastern NY - LaSalle School - Mental Health Empowerment Project - National Association of Social Workers - National Grid - Next Wave - Rehabilitation Support Services - Rensselaer County Department of Health - Rensselaer County Mental Health - Renssela er Park Elementary S chool - Sage College - Samaritan Radiation Oncology - Senator Neil Breslin - Senior Hope - Senior Servic es of Albany and Cohoes Multi -Service Senior Citizen Center, Inc. - St. Catherine's Center for Children - St. Peter's Health Partner s (Numerous departments) - The Community Hospice - The Food Pantries for the Capital District - United Way of the Greater Capitol Region - Unity House - Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood - Van Rensselaer Manor - Village of Colonie Outreach - Visiting Nurses Association of Albany Almost all of these organizations serve medically underserved, low income or minority populations; many of fer specific programs targeted towards these groups. Albany and Rensselaer County Workgroup members selected the following priorities : I. FOCUS AREA: CHRONIC DISEASE a. Reduce Obesity in Children and Adults (inclusive of risk factors and promotion of evidenced -based intervention programs) b. Asthma / tobacco cessation* 10 II. FOCUS AREA: BEHAVIORAL HEALTH a. Prevent Substance Abuse (e.g. opioid) b. Strengthen Mental Health Infrastructure across Systems* The existing Diabetes Task Force will continue their efforts to prevent Type 2 Diabetes, and help patients learn how to self-manage and live a healthy lifestyle. As learned during the Prioritization Meeting, obesity r ates continue to increase. Given the connection between both diabetes and obesity , this task force will also add goals that are related to the reduction in obesity rates in Albany and Rensselaer Counties. The existing Behavioral Health Task Force will focus on Substance Abuse and Opioid Prevention. * Mental Health and Tobacco will receive direction from DSRIP (Delivery System Reimbursement Incentive Payment Program) Activities. DSRIP has initiatives for Mental Health facilities going Tobacco Free, and implementing Tobacco Cessation into treatment planning for those receiving Mental Health Trea tment as well as a focused asthma program. The Integration of Behavioral Health and Primary Care is also a focal point of DSRIP. Activities conducted through these DSRIP projects will be documented through this priority area.

Healthy Capital District Initiative 1 Healthy Capital District Initiative 2 Acknowledgments The principal authors of this report were: Kevin M.P.H. Dr. Jobin-Davis, the Executive Director of the Healthy Capital District Initiative (HCDI), managed and edited the presentation of findings for this Community Health Needs Assessment and the prior editions in 2009, and 2013. He facilitated the prioritization process and provided focus for the development of the Community Health Improvement Plans. Mr. Medvesky, the Director of Health Data Analytics (HCDI), provided invaluable insights and technical expertise in the detailed review of data analysis and text, interpreting these results. Ms. Bolden and Ms. Kelly, Research Analysts (HCDI), made significant contributions to the text and generating tables and charts. The HCDI Public Health Planners, Ms. Carrie Dunn-Herrera, Ms. Keshana Owens-Cody, and Mr. Andrew Velasquez, were instrumental in coordinating the regional Prioritization Work Groups, as well as supporting the regional Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) Development Work Groups. Dr. Melonie Walcott created the narrative for the analysis of the Capital Region Community Health Survey. Ms. Jennifer Kozakiewicz was invaluable in the formatting of the document and its accompanying appendices. This document benefited from the review and input of the members of the Prevention Agenda Workgroup of the Healthy Capital District Initiative. These individuals are subject matter experts from area county public health departments and each of the Capital Region hospitals. Their review of the narrative and the data resulted in helpful edits. They were joined by representatives from community based organizations, businesses, consumers, schools, academics, and disease groups for a total of over 130 different organizations participating in the four Capital Region Public Health Prioritization, and CHIP Work Groups, who considered a data summary of the findings and to develop regional priorities. The member organizations of HCDI also provided valuable financial support for the development of this Report and the community health survey. We are grateful for the contributions of each and every one of these knowledgeable contributors. Healthy Capital District Initiative 3 Health Profile of New York's Capital Region, 2016 In 1997, the counties of Albany, Rensselaer, and Schenectady implemented a joint project to engage health providers and community members in a regional health assessment and prioritization process. This was the first major collaborative venture undertaken by the three local governments, health care providers, insurers, other community organizations and residents to assess health status, identify health priorities, and develop plans to improve the health status of the Capital District. It has been an exciting journey. As a result of the first health profile provided to the sponsors and community in 1997, community members from across the region and interest groups have joined together to develop initiatives for focused action. These initiatives have directly resulted in improved access to needed health services for residents in the Capital District. This Report follows the 2013 Community Health Profile as the fifth data analysis of the health needs in the region. In addition to the original three Capital District counties of Albany, Schenectady and Rensselaer, the 2016 Report includes the additional Population Health Improvement Project (PHIP) counties of Saratoga, Columbia and Greene, into the 6 county Capital Region. The Health Profile expands upon the predominant mortality and years of life lost focus of early editions to include hospitalization and emergency department analyses, prevention quality indicators, and health behaviors. These additional levels of analysis will enable us to track the need and impact of collective efforts to improve health far before the results are terminal. The structure of this report is based upon the 2013-2018 Prevention Agenda of New York State. Utilizing the Prevention Agenda framework for examining public health data, aligns our analysis with that of the New York State Department of Health, creating opportunities to compare the Capital Region to other Upstate counties and New York State goals. This analysis is not completely comprehensive of every health condition or public health issue. In addition, individuals working on a particular health issue, or experiencing it first hand, will undoubtedly have other local data and valuable knowledge to contribute beyond the data reported. The analysis completed was chosen based upon the availability of reliable, comparable data and the delineated priority health areas of the New York State Department of Health. The results should provide a clear description of the prevalence and concentration of each health indicator included. This document would not be possible without the labor, input and support of our sponsors and members of the community. It is the result of over 8 months of meetings with member organizations and community input through our survey of over 2,400 residents of the Capital Region. Their collaboration was invaluable. As a result of these efforts, priority areas for the Capital Region were identified to focus our collective efforts in the coming years: preventing and reducing the burden of obesity and diabetes, mental health, and substance abuse. This Community Health Needs Assessment was completed and approved in June 2016.

Int roduction and Data Summary The purpose of this report is to summarize the public health needs of communities in the Capital Region with the most reliable data available. These indicators provide a broad array of health information that may be useful in determining and monitoring health promotion priorities for the community. The following sections provide an overview of the processes used to select indicators and priorities, and details about individuals and organizations who participated in these processes. Community Being Assessed The communities being assessed in this report are the counties of Albany, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga, Columbia and Greene. They form the common service area covered by the local health departments in Albany, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga, Columbia and Greene Counties and the primary patient population served by Albany Medical Center, Ellis Hospital, St Peter's Health Partners, Saratoga Hospital and Columbia Memorial Hospital, which are located within the six counties. Demographic information on the population in the Capital Region is available from the 2009-2013 U.S. Census's American Community Survey (ACS). The combined population in the Ca pital Region is roughly 952,500 individuals. About 24.2% were 0-19 years of age, while 14.5% were 65 years of age or older. Approximately 11.3% were living in poverty. The race/ethnicity distribution was 85.1% White, 7.7% Black, 4.0% other races; 4.4% were Hispanic/Latino (any race). Additional demographic details are provided in Section III. Data Sources and Indicator Selection The health indicators selected for this report were based on a review of available public health data and New York State priorities promulgated through the Prevention Agenda for a Healthier New York . Upon examination of these key resources, identification of additional indicators of importance with data available, and discussion with public health as well as health care professionals in the Capital Region, it was decided that buildi ng upon the 2013-2018 Prevention Agenda would provide the most comprehensive analysis of available public health needs and behaviors for the Region. The collection and management of this data has been supported by the state for an extended period and are very likely to continue to be supported. This provides reliable and comparable data over time and across the state. These measures, when complemented by the recent Expanded Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and Prevention Quality Indicators, provide health indicators that can be potentially impacted in the short- term. This is a distinct step forward from mortality data leading public health efforts in the past. The Finger Lakes Health Systems Agency provided SPARCS (hospitalizations and ED visits) and Vital Statistics Data Portals that were utilized to generate county and ZIP code level analyses of mortality , Healthy Capital District Initiative 9 hospitalizations, and emergency room utilization, for all residents, by gender, race and ethnicity. The time frames used for the Zip code analyses were 2009-2013 Vital Statistics and 2010-2014 Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) data. The 5-year period establishes more reliable rates when looking at small geographic areas or minority populations.

The 2016 Community Health Survey was conducted from February to March 2016 by the Siena College Research Institute. The survey was a random digit dial telephone survey of adult (18+ years) residents for each of the six counties (n= 400 per county; 2,400 for Capital Region). Cell phones and landlines were utilized for the survey. This consumer survey was conducted to learn about the health needs and concerns Healthy Capital District Initiative 10 of residents in the Capital Region . The Appendix (2016 Capital Region Community Health Survey) contains a detailed summary of the findings, as well as the questionnaire used. Local data were compiled from these data sources and draft reports were prepared by health condition for inclusion in this community health needs assessment. Drafts were reviewed for accuracy and thoroughness by two staff with specialized health knowledge: Kevin Jobin-Davis, Ph.D. who has over 15 years of public health data analysis experience in the Capital Region; and Michael Medvesky, M.P.H. who has over 35 years of experience working with public health data in the New York State Department of Health in many roles including Director of the Public Health Information Group. Drafts of the sections were sent to local subject matter experts for review in the health departments of Albany, Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga, Columbia and Greene Counties and in St. Peter's Health Partners, Albany Medical Center, Ellis Hospital, Saratoga Hospital and Columbia Memorial. Comments were addressed and changes were incorporated into the final document. Structure of this Report: Health Indicators Every year, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) provides updated information on major health indicators for each county. NYSDOH now also provides county-level information on 2013- 2018 Prevention Agenda indicators and objectives that can be used for tracking Prevention Agenda-based efforts. To supplement available information, this report focuses on more detailed information, such as analyses by ZIP code level, gender, race, ethnicity and trends over the past decade. In order to present meaningful information for smaller areas or subgroups, data for several years are combined. Thus, most information presented is based on three or five years of combined data. Still, some areas had too few cases to estimate rates accurately. After presenting information on demographics and cause of death for the Capital Region, a summary of general health status is presented, including information on health care access and usage. This is followed by sections specific to each of the five 2013-2018 New York State Prevention Agenda Priority Areas. Topics within each Priority Area contain a brief synopsis of the condition and why it is of concern. Prevention Agenda objectives are presented and compared to statistics for New York State, excluding New York City, the Capital Region, and the six Capital Region counties. If available, trend data as well as information by gender and race/ethnicity are presented. Indicators include mortality, natality, and emergency department ( ED) visit and hospitalization rates. Additional information from disease registries, administrative data, and the Expanded Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System are also included. ZIP code groups were chosen as a small-area breakdown because there were insufficient data for the primary alternative, census tracts. The groups were selected based on a minimum of 2,500 residents and meaningful groupings generally following municipal or multiple municipal boundaries. Detailed tables are available in the appendices for: ZIP code neighborhood groupings by county; county socio-demographics (age, race/ethnicity, poverty) by neighborhood; county birth indicators by neighborhood; leading causes of death and premature death by county; county hospitalization rates by race and gender; county ED visit rates by race and gender; county hospitalization rates by neighborhood; county emergency department rates by neighborhood; county mortality rates by Healthy Capital District Initiative 11 neighborhood; county and neighborhood prevention quality indicators (PQI); county health rankings; and 2016 Capital Region Community Health Survey results. In addition, the Appendix contains a county listing of \"assets and resources\" specific to the Prevention Agenda Priority Areas chosen by the counties in the Capital Region. Rates For most indicators, age-adjusted rates are presented in the tables. Age-adjustment considers the differing age distributions within populations to calculate rates that can be used for comparison purposes. Direct standardization was used for this report. The advantage of this method is that comparisons of Capital Region data can be made with Prevention Agenda objectives for most indicators. Prevention Agenda and NYSDOH indicators have been age-standardized to the United States 2000 population, thus age-adjusted rates presented in this report are standardized similarly. Data Summary In addition to the data analyses contained in the county-specific Prevention Agenda Prioritization PowerPoint presentations given at the Public Health Priority Workgroup meetings ( http://hcdiny.org/ ), the 2016 Community Health Profile analyzed the health needs of the Region. In 2014, the most recent demographic profile available, the Capital Region was home to approximately 952,500 residents, equally distributed between males and females, with counties ranging from Urban (Schenectady-758 pop. /sq. mile) to Rural (Greene- 75 pop. / sq. mile). The Region's mean age of 40.2 years was higher than that of New York State (NYS). About 17% of the population was 14 years of age or younger, while 16% was 65 years of age and older. Approximately 15% of the Capital Region's population was non -White and 4.4% Hispanic. The Region's median household income of $60,722 was higher than NYS. Its poverty rate of 11.3% was lower than NYS. Almost 16% of the Region's children less than 18 years of age were below poverty . About 8.8% of the Capital Region's population 25 years of age or older had less than a high school education. The health of Capital Region residents was generally consistent with other New York counties outside New York City (Rest of State), although Capital Region residents had a higher overall age-adjusted mortality rate as well as a higher rate of Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) than Rest of State. The YPLL is an indicator driven by premature deaths. Chronic diseases were the leading causes of death in the Capital Region , with heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD), and stroke being the major causes. Injuries were the major cause of death in the child, adolescent, and young adult populations. Health care access indicators show the Capital Region having fewer barriers to care than the Rest of State. Capital Region residents, both children and adults, had higher health insurance coverage rates compared to Rest of State. A higher percent of Capital Region residents also had a regular health care provider. The Capital Region's primary care system also seem ed to be working well compared to Rest of State. When looking at preventable hospitalizations, Capital Region residents had much lower rates than residents from Rest of State did. Total Emergency Department visit rates, as well as total hospitalization rates were also lower in the Capital Region compared to Rest of State. Healthy Capital District Initiative 12 There were many positive trends in the Capital Region. Coronary heart disease, stroke, asthma, colorectal cancer, and female breast cancer trends decreased in the past decade. There were also decreasing rates in gonorrhea and HIV. Children 19-35 months of age had higher immunization rates, and women aged 13- 17 years had higher HPV vaccination rates than the Rest of State. The Capital Region had also seen a positive change in certain health behaviors. While adult obesity rates have increased slightly in the Capital Region, they have not increased as much as the Rest of State. A greater percentage of residents participated in some leisure time physical activity than the Rest of State. They also consumed less sugary drinks, and ate at \"fast food\" establishments less than their Rest of State counterparts. However, many measurements were not as positive, particularly in lower income, inner-city neighborhoods where many rates were 3 to 7 times higher than the county average. Obesity and its related diseases continue to be health issues in the Capital Region . Almost 28% of adult residents were considered obese , or approximately 196,000 adult residents. Obesity in the Capital Region's school children was also alarming, with over 17% of children being considered obese. Diabetes mortality and short-term complication hospitalizations were higher in the Capital Region than Rest of State. Adult smoking rates, lung cancer incidence and mortality, and chronic lower respiratory disease mortality rates were all higher in the Capital Region compared to Rest of State. Adult asthma prevalence, as well as asthma ED visit and hospitalization rates were also higher in the Capital Region. The incidence of positive blood lead in children less than 72 months of age, as well as childhood lead screening, continued to be a Capital Region issue, with rates much higher than residents of Rest of State. Capital Region women had higher rates of infant mortality, low birthweight, and late or no prenatal care than Rest of State women. Capital Region teens had much higher pregnancy rates compared to their Rest of State counterparts. Mammography screening rates for the general population, as well as the Medicaid population, were lower in the Capital Region, while late stage female breast incidence and mortality rates were higher, compared to Rest of State. Chlamydia rates were also much higher in the Capital Region, with increasing trends over the past decade. Capital Region counties presented some of the highest Lyme disease case rates in New York State. Mental Health indicators such as \"poor mental health days\", suic ide mortality, and self- inflicted injury hospitalization rates were higher in the Capital Region compared to Rest of State. Substance abuse indicators also show there is a growing problem in the Capital Region. Substance abuse (any diagnosis) ED visit and hospitalization rates were higher than Rest of State, with increasing trends. Opioid-related ED visit rates have been increasing in all Capital Region counties. New York State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) certified treatment programs in the Capital Region have seen a 90% increase in clients receiving heroin dependency treatment between 2011 and 2014. Binge drinking and cirrhosis mortality were also higher in the Capital Region compared to Rest of State. The Siena Community Health Survey collected responses from a representative sample of Capital Region adults (18+ years). A set of questions asked for feedback on perceived community obstacles. Even with the increased percentage of Capital Region residents covered by some form of health insurance, 40% identified the cost of getting medical care as a very significant obstacle; slightly less of the residents (27%) identified the cost of mental health services as a very significant obstacle. However, 31% identified their reluctance to seek help with a mental health issue as a very significant obstacle. About 31% of Capital Region residents felt the cost of food, and 14% identified access to grocery stores with nutritious options, as very significant obstacles. About 18% of the residents felt access to a safe place to exercise, and 21% Healthy Capital District Initiative 13 the costs associated with being physically active, as very significant community obstacles. Capital Region residents were asked to identify what were the most important health-related issues to address in their community. About 31% of the residents identified \"reducing obesity in both teens and adults\", 27% identified \"improving both substance abuse treatment and awareness programs\", and 23% identified \"improving both preventive care and management for chronic diseases like diabetes, asthma and heart disease\" as the most important issues. Gender Capital Region women had 1.2 times the percent of individuals living below poverty compared to male residents (12.5% vs 10.6%). Capital Region women present ed a better preventive health picture than their male counterparts. For 2011-13, male residents had higher age-adjusted total mortality rates than females (821.9/100,000 vs 598.8). A greater percentage of females were covered by health insurance, were more likely to have a primary care health provider, were more likely to have received routine medical checkup, and were less likely to be a current smoker or binge drinker than men from the region . Capital Region adult females (27.9%) and males (27.4%) had similar rates of obesity, but females consumed less sugary drinks or ate less fast food meals than male residents. Adult females reported a higher percentage of self-reported poor health, and higher rates of poor physical health days and poor mental health days than male residents. Females had 10% higher mental disease and disorder hospitalizations than their male counterparts. Adult females had higher asthma prevalence, and 60% higher asthma hospitalization rates than males. Elderly female residents also had 60% higher fall hospitalizations than male residents. There are a few conditions with mixed results. While Capital Region females have 1.6 times the self- inflicted injury hospitalization rates, males have 5 times the suicide mortality rates. Similarly, females had 40% higher chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD) hospitalization rates, males had 20% higher CLRD mortality rates. Compared to their female Capital Region counterparts, males had higher adult diabetes prevalence, 30% higher diabetes hospitalization rate, and 50% higher diabetes mortality rate. They had higher total cancer, lung cancer, and colorectal cancer mortality rates than female residents. Males also had higher prevalence of high blood pressure, coronary heart disease mortality, and congestive heart failure mortality than females. Capital Region males had 2.4 times the unintentional injury mortality rates, and 3.2 times the assault hospitalization rates compared to females. Regarding substance abuse indicators, males had 2.5 times the substance abuse (any diagnosis) mortality rates, 3.5 times the opiate poisoning mortality, 30% higher drug abuse (primary diagnosis) hospitalization rates and 40% the opiate poisoning hospitalization rates than female Capital Region residents. Healthy Capital District Initiative 14 Race/Ethnicity In general, Black non-Hispanic Capital Region residents were at greater health risk than White non- Hispanic residents. Black non-Hispanics had 5.5 times the percent of families below poverty compared to White non-Hispanic Capital Region residents (28.7% vs 5.2%). Hispanics had similar poverty rates as Black non-Hispanics (27.1%). For 2011-13, Black non-Hispanic residents also had higher age-adjusted total mortality rates than White non-Hispanics (836.6/100,000 vs 704.5). Hispanic Capital Region residents had the lowest age-adjusted total mortality rates (498.6). For 2012-2014, Black non-Hispanic residents had 2.7 times the age-adjusted total ED visit rates (6063/10,000 vs 2286) and 1.5 times the age-adjusted total hospitalization rates as White non- Hispanic residents (1273/10,000 vs 860). When reviewing the total Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI), Black non- Hispanic Capital Region residents had 2 times the age-adjusted total PQI rates compared to their White non-Hispanic counterparts (166/10,000 vs 84). Hispanic Capital Region residents had lower ED visit, hospitalization and PQI rates than White non-Hispanic residents. When compared to White non-Hispanics, Black non-Hispanic Capital Region residents had serious issues with diabetes. They had 2.6 times higher diabetes mortality rates; 3.3 times higher diabetes (primary diagnosis) hospitalization rates; and 4 times higher rates of hospitalizations due to short-term complications of diabetes. In addition, Black non-Hispanic residents also had 4 times the asthma hospitalization rates; 3.9 times higher teen pregnancy rates; 26% lower adequate prenatal care rates; and 2 times higher low birthweight rates than their White non-Hispanic counterparts. In addition to having over 20% higher age-adjusted total cancer mortality rates, Black non-Hispanics had higher lung, breast and colorectal cancer mortality rates than White non-Hispanic Capital Region residents. The difference in assault hospitalizations was especially striking. Black non-Hispanics had 6.4 times the assault hospitalization rates than White non-Hispanic residents. In addition, Black non-Hispanic residents had 1.6 times the mental disease and disorder (any diagnosis) hospitalization rates, and 1.5 times the drug abuse (primary diagnosis) hospitalization rates compared to White non-Hispanic residents. CLRD, one of the leading causes of death in the Capital Region, had unusual disparity data. Black non- Hispanic residents had a 1.8 times higher age-adjusted hospitalization rate for CLRD, while White non- Hispanics had 1.6 times higher CLRD mortality rates. Similarly, Black non-Hispanic residents had a 2.5 times higher age-adjusted hospitalization rate for congestive heart failure (CHF), while White non- Hispanic residents had 2 times higher CHF mortality rates. However, there are conditions where the Capital Region White non-Hispanic population fare poorly compared to their Black non-Hispanic counterparts. The rate of hospitalizations of the elderly due to falls showed that White non-Hispanic residents had a 1.9 times higher rates than their Black non-Hispanic counterparts. White non-Hispanics also had 1.1 times age-adjusted unintentional injury mortality and 1.2 times flu/pneumonia mortality rates than Black non-Hispanics. In addition, White non-Hispanics had 1.1 times the age-adjusted self-inflicted injury hospitalization rates and 2.2 times the suicide mortality rates. Recently substance abuse indicators are moving away from targeting minority populations. White non- Hispanic Capital Region residents had 1.1 times the age-adjusted substance abuse (any diagnosis) Healthy Capital District Initiative 15 mortality rates and 1.2 times the opiate poisoning (any diagnosis) hospitalization rates compared to Black non-Hispanic residents. The relatively small number of Asian non-Hispanic and Hispanic Capital District residents cautions interpretation of indicators for these populations.

County Health Rankings- 2016 The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, together with the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, develop annual health rankings for every county in the United States (http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/ ). Counties are ranked on \"Health Outcomes\" (the present health of the county) and on \"Health Factors\" (the future health of the county). The Appendix contains the 2016 Rankings for each of six Capital Region counties. The \"Health Outcome Rankings\" show a wide range within the Capital Region with Saratoga County ranked # 1 for all New York counties, while Schenectady County was ranked #49 and Greene County #59. However, the \"Health Factor Rankings\" show the Capital Region doing well compared to the rest of New York State counties. All the counties, with the exception of Greene, fell into the top quartile of counties, from Saratoga #4 to Schenectady #16. Greene County also improved to a rank of #43 in New York State. Healthy Capital District Initiative 31 II. Community Public Health Priorities Collaboration and Community Engagement Engaging the community in the health needs assessment process was a priority of HCDI and its stakeholders. Broad community engagement began with participation in the community health survey. The surveys offered multiple choice and open-ended que stions to learn about residents' health needs, health behaviors and barriers to care. Demographic information collected by the survey allowed review of information by age, gender, race/ethnicity and income. Survey results were incorporated into the examination of health needs by the members of the 4 Capital Region Public Health Prioritization Workgroups (Albany-Rensselaer, Columbia-Greene, Saratoga and Schenectady). The Workgroups included community voices through representatives from consumers, community based organizations that serve low-income residents, the homeless, those with HIV/AIDS, advocacy groups, employers, public health departments, providers and health insurers. Participants were encouraged to share data of their own and to advocate for the needs of their constituents. While all health institutions serve high need individuals, the two federally qualified health centers, Food Pantries of the Capital District, United Way of the Capital Region, Interfaith Partnership for the Homeless, and our consumer community representatives have unique access to medically underserved residents. Selection of Priorities Selection of the top health priorities for the Capital Region was based on a multi-year process building on existing knowledge from present Community Health Improvement Plan/Community Service Plan implementation efforts, as well as the 2015 Medicaid Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) Needs Assessment. A Capital Region Prevention Agenda Steering Committee was formed to guide the 2016 Public Health Prioritization process and Plan development. Meetings were held during Fall/Winter 2015-2016 with participation from local health departments of Albany, Columbia, Greene, Rensselaer, Saratoga and Schenectady counties, St. Peter's Health Partners, Ellis Medicine, Albany Medical Center, Saratoga Hospital, Columbia Memorial Hospital and HCDI to ensure that health needs analysis, prioritization and community health plans were timely and of high quality. Members of these organizations worked to identify individuals to participate in the Capital Region Public Health Prioritization Workgroups. The Capital Region Public Health Prioritization Workgroups were formed to review data analyses prepared by HCDI and to select the top priorities with one health disparity to be addressed. Data presentations were given at the meetings to provide summarized available data on the leading problems in each of the Workgroup's service areas . Health indicators were included in the Prioritization data presentations if: At least one of the county rates were significantly higher than the New York State, excluding New York City data; or Healthy Capital District Initiative 32 At least one of the county rates are in the highest risk quartile in the state; or Rates for the health condition worsened over the past decade for one of the counties; or The health condition was a leading cause of death in one of the counties; or Disparity between rates was clearly evident in sub-populations; or There were a high absolute number of cases in the counties. Health indicators that met the criteria were included in the data presentations f or each of the five Prevention Agenda Priority Areas: Prevent Chronic Diseases , Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment, Promote Healthy Women, Infants, and Children, Promote Mental Health and Prevent Substance Abuse, and Prevent HIV/STDs, Vaccine Preventable Diseases and Healthcare-Associated Infections. Ninety (90) health indicators across the five Prevention Agenda Priority Areas were presented. Available data on prevalence, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, mortality and trends were included for each indicator. Equity data for gender, age, race/ethnicity, and neighborhood groupings were presented as available. After the presentation, these data were made available to Capital Region partners on the HCDI website ( http://hcdiny.org/ ). After the presentation of each set of health indicators, a discussion was held to answer any questions, or for individuals to share their experiences with the health condition in the population. Participants did a preliminary vote on the importance of the condition in the community based on three qualitative dimensions: the impact of the condition on quality of life and cost of health care; if there was community awareness and concern about the condition; and the opportunity to prevent or reduce the burden of this health issue on the community. Participants were provided with a Prioritization Tracking Tool to record their own comments and measure their thoughts on the severity, community values, and opportunity regarding each health indicator. Upon completion of the data summaries, Capital Region Public Health Prioritization Workgroup members were given an opportunity to advocate for the priority they believed was most meritorious and the group voted on the top two Prevention Agenda categories. Behavioral health and chronic disease categories received the greatest amount of votes by far, because they impact ed the largest number of people in the most significant ways, both directly and indirectly, through their influence on other health conditions. They also contributed most significantly to the cost of health care. A summary of each Capital Region Public Health Priority Workgroup is as follows: Albany-Rensselaer Public Health Priority Workgroup The Albany Rensselaer Public Health Priority Workgroup was spearheaded by the Albany County Department of Health, the Rensselaer County Department of Health, Albany Medical Center, and St. Peters Health Partners. Because the hospitals catchment areas covered both counties, it was felt a joint- county Albany-Rensselaer Public Health Priority Workgroup was appropriate. Three meetings were held on February 10, February 24, and March 18, 2016. During these meetings, HCDI presented heath indicators for each of the 5 Prevention agenda Priority Areas, and facilitated Albany-Rensselaer Public Healthy Capital District Initiative 33 Health Priority Workgroup discussions. The Power Point data presentations used during these meetings were made available to the Albany-Rensselaer Public Health Priority Workgroup members and the public on the HCDI Website ( http://www.hcdiny.org/ ). The Albany-Rensselaer Public Health Priority Workgroup choose their priorities at the last Workgroup meeting. Organizations participating in the Albany-Rensselaer Public Health Priority Workgroup include: - Albany County Department of Health - Albany County Department of Mental Health - Albany County Department of Social Services - Albany Medical Center - Albany Medical Center: DSRIP - Albany Rensselaer Cancer Program - Alzheimer's Association - Belvedere Health Services, LLC - Berkshire Farm Center & Youth Services - Capital District Childcare Coordinating Council - Capital District Physicans' Health Plan (CDPHP) - Capital District Psychiatric Center- Office of Mental Health - Capital District Tobacco-Free Coalition - Capital District Transportation Committee - Capital District YMCA - Capitol Region BOCES - Care Coordination Services - Catholic Charities - Catholic Charities: Commuity Maternity Services - Center for Disability Services - City of Albany Police Department - Colonie Senior Services Centers - Commission for Economic Opportunity - Community Care Behavioral Health Organization - Conifer Park - Fidelis Care Network - Hometown Health Centers - Hospitatlity House - Independent Living Center of the Hudson Valley - Interfaith Partnership - Jewish Family Services of Northeastern NY - LaSalle School - Mental Health Empowerment Project - National Association of Social Workers - National Grid - Next Wave - Rehabilitation Support Services - Rensselaer County Department of Health Healthy Capital District Initiative 34 - Rensselaer County Department of Mental Health - Rensselaer Park Elementary school - Samaritan Radiation Oncology - Senator Neil Breslin - Senior Hope - Senior Servics of Albany and Cohoes Multi-Service Senior Citizen Center, Inc. - St. Catherine's Center for Children - St. Mary's Hospital - St. Peter's Health Partenrs - The Community Hospice - The Food Pantries for the Capital District - The Sage Colleges - United Way of the Greater Capital Region - Unity House - University at Albany School of Public Health - Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood - Van Rensselaer Manor - Village of Colonie Outreach - Visiting Nurses Association of Albany - Xerox State Healthcare Albany and Rensselaer Counties completed the Community Health Prioritization Meetings together between February and March 2016. Attendance during these meetings ranged between 40- 60 participants representing many healthcare, community based and public service providers. Participants were engaged in the data presentations, raised many questions, and provided what services look like day to day. During the Asthma Data presentation there was much reflection on how Care Coordination Services truly help patients understand how to reduce asthma emergencies and also how to react in the midst of a crisis that helps reduce emergency room visits. Action plans were viewed as positive for patients especially when patients make them visible on refrigerators, in the school, etc. During the Diabetes discussion participants raised many questions around the availability of data on other health related matters that maybe risks of diabetes such as vision issues and obesity. Medication therapy for diabetes may require dose adjustments or may be contraindicated in patients with chronic kidney disease. When reviewing obesity data participants began to draw a correlation to neighborhoods that maybe more of risk due to lack of access to healthy foods, and recreation. Participants were able to provide insight to students in school and their inability to pass many of the physical assessments conducted in Physical Education classes. During the Mental Health and Substance Abuse presentation participants from both counties reflected how much of a crisis the opioid epidemic is here in the Capital Region. Data presented supported the need for more Mental Health and Substance Abuse professionals. Healthy Capital District Initiative 35 Albany and Rensselaer Counties selected the following Prevention Agenda Priority Areas: I. FOCUS AREA: CHRONIC DISEASE a. Reduce Obesity in Children and Adults (inclusive of risk factors and promotion of evidenced-based intervention programs) b. Asthma / tobacco cessation (existing CHIP and DSRIP activity) II. FOCUS AREA: BEHAVIORAL HEALTH a. Prevent Substance Abuse (e.g. opioid) b. Strengthen Mental Health Infrastructure across Systems (existing CHIP and DSRIP activity) The existing Behavioral Health Task Force will focus (Substance Abuse/Mental Health/Tobacco) on Substance Abuse and Opioid Prevention. Mental Health and Tobacco will receive direction from DSRIP (Delivery System Reimbursement Incentive Payment Program) activities. DSRIP has initiatives for Mental Health facilities going Tobacco Free, and implementing Tobacco Cessation into treatment planning for those receiving Mental Health Treatment. The Integration of Mental Health and Primary Care is also a focal point of DSRIP. Activities conducted through these DSRIP projects will be documented through this priority area. The existing Diabetes Task Force will continue their efforts to prevent type 2 diabetes, and help patients learn how to self-manage and live a healthy lifestyle. As learned during the Prioritization Meeting, obesity rates continue to increase. Given the connection between both diabetes and obesity this task force will also add goals that are related to the reduction in obesity rates in Albany and Rensselaer Counties. Schenectady Public Health Priority Workgroup The Schenectady Public Health Priority Workgroup was spearheaded by Schenectady County Public Health Services, Ellis Medicine and Sunnyview Rehabilitation Hospital. However, they have been working with other Schenectady Partners through the Schenectady Coalition for Healthy Communities (SCHC). The SCHC has been implementing, monitoring and evaluating Schenectady County Prevention Agenda activities since 2013. Three meetings were held on February 4, February 19, and March 31, 2016. During these meetings, HCDI presented heath indicators for each of the 5 Prevention agenda Priority Areas, and facilitated Workgroup discussions. The Power Point data presentations used during these meetings were made available to the Workgroup members and the general public on the HCDI Website ( http://www.hcdiny.org/ ). The Workgroup choose their priorities at the last Workgroup meeting. Organizations participating in the Schenectady Public Health Priority Workgroup include: - 820 River Street Treatment Facility - Alliance For Better Health Care - Schenectady County The ARC - Boys and Girls Club - Capital District Childcare Council - Capital Roots - Care Central Healthy Capital District Initiative 36 - Catholic Charities - CDPHP Health Plan - Capital District Tobacco Free Coalition - Center for Disablitiy - Conifer Park - Consumer Directed Choices - DePaul Housing Management - Ellis Asthma Care - Ellis Family Health Center - Ellis Medicine - Ellis Primary Care - Kingsway Community - MVP Health Care - New Choices Recovery Center - Planned Parenthood - Recovery Support Services - Schenectady Community Action Program - Schenectady County Community College - Schenectady County Human Rights - Schenectady County Public Library - Schenectady Public Health Services - Schenetady County Office of Community Service - Schenectady Inner City Ministry - St. Peters Health Partners - Substance Abuse Prevention Coalition - Sunnyview - Tobacco Free Coaltion - University at Albany - YMCA In the Schenectady County Prioritization Meetings, input was received from the community on a number of health issues that the community struggles with. Representatives from the organizations which work with the City School District highlighted that the schools are seeing a vast increase in mental health issues. Members of the community from both the Substance Abuse Prevention Council and the recovery centers spoke of the many challenges that their population faces and the lack of resources to address their needs- especially the limited capacity for substance abuse treatment, especially heroin. Many members of the community voiced concern over the increased number of newborn drug-related discharges. Community members and the Tobacco Free Coalition members also voiced their concern over the many alcohol and tobacco related diseases in the community, and the relationship between alcohol and/or tobacco and mental health and/or substance abuse issues. Many in the meeting also stated that they felt strongly that obesity is a comorbidity for the many challenges that the community faces. In addition, representatives from the Public Health Department and Ellis hospital highlighted the Healthy Capital District Initiative 37 many challenges that members of the community with diabetes face and also that with more support, the growing number of ER visits and hospitalizations for diabetes related complications could be avoided. Another important insight from the community was that within the City of Schenectady, Hamilton Hill has an especially high rate of both physical and mental health issues, and has a tremendous lack of resources and services to adequately address these issues. Schenectady County began their CHIP prioritization planning process on May 26th, 2016. At that meeting, partners were identified to form work groups/task forces on the priority areas selected. It is expected that CHIPS will be developed by September 30, 2016. The county has selected the following Prevention Agenda Priority Areas: I. Priority Area: Promote Mental Health and Prevent Substance Abuse Focus Area: Prevent Substance Abuse and other Mental, Emotional, Behavioral Disease II. Priority Area: Prevent Chronic Disease Focus Area: Reduce Obesity in Children and Adults Saratoga Public Health Priority Workgroup The Saratoga Public Health Priority Workgroup was spearheaded by the Saratoga County Health Department and Saratoga Hospital. Three meetings were held on February 10, February 24, and March 18, 2016. During these meetings, HCDI presented heath indicators for each of the 5 Prevention agenda Priority Areas, and facilitated Workgroup discussions. The Power Point data presentations used during these meetings were made available to the Workgroup members and the general public on the HCDI Website ( http://www.hcdiny.org/ ). The Workgroup choose their priorities at the last Workgroup meeting. Organizations participating in the Saratoga Public Health Priority Workgroup include: - Albany Medical Center - Alcohol & Substance Abuse Prevention Council - Albany Medical Center Physicians Assistant Program - Capital Consulting Group, LLC - Captain Youth and Family Services - Catholic Charities - Catholic Charities Care Coord Serv - City of Saratoga Springs - Council for Prevention and DSRIP - Domestic Violence Advocacy/ Family Res Programs - Ellis Hospital Urgent Care, Clifton Park - Four Winds - Franklin Community Center, Inc. - Healthy Capital District Initiative (HCDI) - LaSalle Counseling Healthy Capital District Initiative 38 - Mental Health ~ Saratoga Hospital - Northern Rivers Family of Services - NYS Court System - Office of Mental Health - Parsons @ Malta - Recovery Advocacy In Saratoga - Rehabilitation Support Services Capital Dist Stabilitazation and Support Program - Saratoga Community Health Center - Saratoga Center for the Family - Saratoga City Court Judge - Saratoga Community Health Center - Saratoga County Alcohol and Sub Abuse Services - Saratoga County Dept of Disablity and Social Services - Saratoga County Emergency Medical Services - Saratoga County Mental Health Ctr. - Saratoga County Public Health - Saratoga County Sheriff - Saratoga Emergency Physicians - Saratoga Hospital - Saratoga Hospital Emergency Department - Saratoga Springs, Mayor's Office - Schuylerville High School - Shenendehowa School District - Shelters of Saratoga - St Peters Addiction Recovery Services - Saratoga - Saratoga Springs Police Department - St Lukes Recovery Residence Center - Transitional Services Association, Inc. - Veteran Mental Health Council @ VA - Wellspring In the Saratoga County Prioritization Meetings, input was received from the community on a number of Mental Health and Substance Abuse topics. Representatives from the school districts highlighted that one third of the students in some schools are reporting being depressed. Members of the community from both the Substance Abuse Prevention Council and the Sheriff's department noted that the Narcan training in the county has been very successful but there needs to be more training done. Many members of the community voiced concern that doctors were prescribing opiates recklessly. Employees from hospitals voiced their concern over the increased number of newborn drug-related discharges. Many community members voiced their concern over the many alcohol related events in the county and that the bars close at 4 am. Many in the meeting also stated that they felt strongly that poor mental health increases substance abuse and self-medicating. Representatives from the Tobacco Coalition expressed to the group how dire the consequences of smoking are amongst those with mental health Healthy Capital District Initiative 39 conditions and informed the group that that population will die 25 years earlier than those without mental illness. Some members of the community also pointed out how obesity plays a role in mental health and substance abuse and that the lack of physical activity and increased screen time rates have serious impacts on the quality of life overall. Saratoga County selected the following Prevention Agenda Priority Areas: I. Priority Area: Promote Mental Health and Prevent Substance Abuse Focus Area: Promote Mental Health II. Priority Area: Promote Mental Health and Prevent Substance Abuse Focus Area: Prevent Substance Abuse (e.g. opioid) The Saratoga DOH is facilitating the CHIP prioritization planning meetings in April, May, June, a nd August. In the first meeting which took place, April 28th , 2016 it was determined that there would be two work groups, a Mental Health work group and a Substance Abuse Prevention work group. At the second CHIP planning meeting, which took place, May 12th , 2016, the Commissioner of Mental Health led the Mental Health Work Group and the Executive Director of the Prevention Council led the Substance Abuse Work Group. The Director of the Saratoga County DOH facilitated the Substance Abuse work group and the Saratoga County DOH Health Educator and PHIP Public Health Planner facilitated the Mental Health work group. At the conclusion of those meetings, the Mental Health Work Group selected Prevention Agenda Goal 2.3, Prevent suicides among youth and adults and the Substance Abuse Prevention Work Group selected Prevention Agernda Goal 3.2, Strengthen infrastructure for Mental, Emotional, Behavioral (MEB) health promotion and MEB disorder prevention. It is expected that CHIPS will be developed by 9/30/2016. Columbia-Greene Public Health Priority Workgroup The Columbia-Greene Public Health Priority Workgroup was led by Greene County Public Health, Columbia County Department of Health, and Columbia Memorial Hospital. Columbia and Greene counties share similar demographic characteristics and health metrics. For this reason the counties elected to align efforts around mutually-selected priority areas. The Prioritization Workgroup was the product of the collaborative decision. Three meetings were help during the prioritization process on: February 12th, March 2nd, and March 16th. During these meetings, HCDI presented health indicators related to the five Prevention Agenda Priority Areas and then facilitated discussions. The PowerPoint data presentations used during these meetings were made available to the Workgroup members, and the general public on the HCDI website ( www.hcdiny.org ). The workgroup choose the priority areas they would focus on during the last workgroup meeting. Organizations that participated in the Columbia- Greene Public Health Priority Workgroup include: Healthy Capital District Initiative 40 - Alzheimer's Association, Faith Outreach - Apogee Center - Catholic Charities - COARC - Columbia Greene Community College - Columbia County Community Healthcare Consortium (Tobacco-Free Action) - Columbia County Department of Health - Columbia County Emergency Medical Service - Columbia Memorial Hospital, Community Health Services - Columbia Memorial Hospital, Mobile Dental Health Services - Columbia-Greene Mental Health Center - Community Action of Greene County - Cornell Cooperative Extension - Division of Community Services (Greene County) - Eddy visiting Nurse Association - Greene County Department of Social Services - Greene County Human Services - Greene County Family Planning - Greene County Legislature - Greene County Mental Health - Greene County Public Health - Healthy Capital District Initiative - Hudson City School District - Mobilizing for Action Through Planning and Partnership (MAPP) - Rural Health Network - St. Peter's Health Partners - St. Peter 's Health Partners (Health Program and Promotion) - St. Peter's Health Partners (Tobacco-Free Health System) - Twin County Recovery Services - Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood - Columbia County Community Healthcare Consortium In the Columbia and Greene County Prioritization Meetings, many of the participating community members offered feedback, and expressed concern around the topic of substance abuse (primarily opiate abuse). Community members shared that the increased prevalence identified in the data presentation was visible in substance abuse programs in the community, and that prescription opiate abuse and heroin use was the pressing concern of the county. Community participants from the Twin County Recovery Center highlighted the comorbid issues that are intertwined with opiate abuse (e.g. increase in difficulties around housing, employment, and psychosocial wellbeing; added stress on interfamily and intercommunity dynamics; decrease in school performance of the children of opiate abusers, etc.). DOH representatives shared that although the prevalence rate (actual number of active cases) of opiate abuse does not represent a large number of lives, the incidence rate (new cases over a set period of time) was increasing at a \"staggering rate.\" Community Healthy Capital District Initiative 41 members expressed their desire to address the problem proactively (preventing new cases) instead of intervening reactively (addressing those who already have a problem). Obesity was also identified as a major concern of the community members. Meeting participants expressed shock at the prevalence of obesity among their population, specifically the overweight and obese rate of the counties' youth. Meeting participants agreed on the need to increase leisure time activity but acknowledged this would be a difficult object ive given the county's rural nature, and the need to drive for many everyday tasks. Cornell Cooperative Extension (CCE) participants shared that they used to have a program that focused on improving nutritional decision-making via education but that the program had lost its funding. Meeting participants who focus on obesity in the county identified Hudson City as a high-need area for obesity programming. Participants were also interested in learning about the density of fast food establishments in the count y. Columbia and Greene Counties selected the following Prevention Agenda Priority Areas: I. Priority Area: Chronic Disease a. Focus Area: Reduce Obesity in Children and Adults II. Priority Area: Promote Mental Health and Prevent Substance Abuse a. Focus Area: Prevent Substance Abuse and other mental Emotional Behavioral Disorders The Greene County Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) community group and the Columbia County Public Health Leadership group will support the development of a joint-county task force for each Priority Area. Community health partners who work in each respective priority area will comprise each Priority Area-focused task force. Each task force will meet on a monthly basis and community partners responsible for priority area actions will provide updates on ongoing and projected activities and interventions. The task forces will be responsible for alignment and guidance of all countywide activities related to each Priority Area. Healthy Capital District Initiative 42 III.

Healthy Capital District Initiative 47 IV. General Health Status Highlights Capital Region total age -adjusted mortality rates have decreased over the last decade. Rensselaer County had the highest 2011 -13 total mortality rate. Schenectady, Greene and Rensselaer counties did not meet the Prevention Agenda Objective for percentage of premature deaths, with Greene County having the highest percentage in the Capital Region. The Region's YPLL rate was more than that of Upstate NY; only Saratoga County had an YPLL rate that was lower than Upstate NY, with Greene County having the highest Capital Region rate. Males and Black non -Hispanics had the highest mortality , premature death and YPLL rates. Total Age-Adjusted Mortality When comparing the age-adjusted total mortality rates in the Capital Region, there has been a decrease in the rates between 2004-06 and 2011-13 for all counties, ranging from a 3.3% decrease in Schenectady County to a 15.1% decrease in Greene County.

Black non-Hispanic residents had almost a 20% higher total mortality rate than White non-Hispanics (819.4 vs. 691.7). Hispanic residents had the lowest Capital Region mortality rate (566.7).2 Leading Causes of Death Within the Capital Region, the top leading causes of death are heart disease, cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD), stroke, unintentional injury, and pneumonia/influenza.3 County-specific Leading Causes of Death are contained in the Appendix. When reviewing the leading causes of death in New York State by race/ethnicity, White-non Hispanics have the same five leading causes of death as the Capital Region. Black non-Hispanic New Yorkers had heart disease and cancer as the top two causes of death; however, these were followed by diabetes, unintentional injury, and pneumonia/influenza. For the Hispanic population, the leading causes of death were heart disease, cancer, unintentional injury, stroke and diabetes.3 Premature Death and Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 Reduce the percentage of premature deaths (before age 65 years) to 21.8% Premature deaths occur before the expected time of death.

Saratoga County and Schenectady County had the lowest Capital Region rates for adult 18 -64 years having a routine checkup in the last year. The Capital Region PQI rates were better than comparable rates for Upstate NY. With the exception of Acute PQI conditions, Schenectady County had the highest rates in the Capital Region for all PQI categories. Capital Region Black -non Hispanic to White non -Hispanic ratios for PQI categories ranged from 3.7 for Diabetes conditions to 1.2 for Respiratory conditi ons. With exception of Acute conditions, males had higher PQI rates than female Capital Region residents. Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 Increase the percentage of adult New Yorkers who have a regular health care provider to 90.8%. Health Care Usage More than 2.2 million adults in New York State, or 15%, lack a regular primary care provider. A lack of access to a primary care provider results in negative health outcomes. Primary care, including prenatal care, provides a prime opportunity for prevention education, early detection, early treatment, and referral to other needed health and social services. Sustained contact with a primary care provider improves the consistency and efficacy of treatment for long-term chronic care patients.1 About 86% of adults in the Capital Region, indicated that they had a regular health care provider. Adult female Capital Region residents were more likely to have a health care provider than males (92.0% versus 81.0%). White non- Hispanic Capital Region adults were more likely to have a health care provider (87.5%) than Black non-Hispanic (74.9%) or Hispanic (79.8%) residents. 2 Over 101,000 Capital Region adults indicated that they did not have a regular health care provider; however, 80% to 95% of adults residing in the six Capital District counties have a primary care physician, clinic health center, or other place where they usually go to seek health care or health-related advice.

Early detection of health problems improves the chances of successful treatment; therefore, receiving the right health services, screenings and treatment increases the chances of living a longer, healthy and productive life.1 Capital Region adults, 18-64 years, indicated that 71.7% had visited a doctor for a routine checkup within the past year. Females were more likely than males to have had a routine doctor's visit within the past year (77.1% versus 66.4%). Surprisingly, when reviewing the rates by race/ethnicity, adult Black non- Hispanics had the highest rate for routine doctor's visit within the last year at 78.0%, compared to White non-Hispanic (70.2%) and Hispanic (72.3%) Capital Region residents. 2 Approximately 168,500 Capital Region adults 18-64 year s did not have a routine doctor's visit within the past year. Only three Capital Region counties either met or exceeded the New York State rate of adults who had a routine doctor's visit within the last year. Saratoga and Schenectady Counties had the lowe st rates2. Structural, financial, and personal barriers can limit access to health care. Structural barriers include transportation, the distance to providers, insurance policy regulations, the lack of health care facilities, primary care providers, medic al specialists, or other health care professionals to meet the public's needs. In addition to not having health insurance, financial barriers can also include not having the financial capacity to cover the cost of services or co-pays in accordance with health plan guidelines. Personal barriers include cultural or spiritual differences, language barriers, not knowing what to do or when to seek care, or concerns about confidentiality. When these barriers exist, care is often not well coordinated or as effective as it should be. Individuals may experience difficulty scheduling or keeping appointments. Delays in seeking treatment or not receiving appropriate screenings reduce overall health care quality.1 64.066.068.070.072.074.076.078.0 New York Capital Greene72.371.772.376.6 68.7 68.576.4 70.5% of Adults 18 -64 Years who saw a doctor for a routine checkup within the last year, 2013 -20142 Healthy Capital District Initiative 54 Approximately 10.8% of adult Capital Region residents indicated that cost prevented them from visiting a doctor within the past year. Females were slightly more likely to have difficulty due to cost than males (11.1% versus 9.7%). Cost was more of a barrier to Hispanic adults (24.0%) compared to Black non- Hispanic (15.6%) or White non-Hispanic (9.6%) Capital Region residents. 2 An estimated 78,800 adults in the Capital Region had difficulty in accessing needed care due to financial constraints. With the exception of Schenectady (12.4%), the rates for the Capital Region counties were all lower than the Upstate New York rate.2 Access to Primary and Preventive Care Access to quality primary and preventive care is the cornerstone of a comprehensive health care system. Prevention quality indicators (PQIs) are measures used to assess good primary and preventive health care. These are ambulatory-sensitive care conditions where good primary care can potentially prevent related hospitalizations. PQI data includes information on the 12 PQIs, and inn four categories: diabetes (including short-term complications, long-term complications, uncontrolled diabetes, lower-extremity amputations among diabetics); circulatory (including hypertension, congestive heart failure, angina); respiratory (including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma); and Acute (including dehydration, bacterial pneumonia, urinary tract infection).4 Age-Adjusted PQI Hospitalization Rates per 10,000 Population of 18+ Years, 2011 -20134 All PQI (12) Conditions Diabetes Conditions Circulatory Conditions Respiratory Conditions Acute Conditions NYS excl.

Black non -Hispanic residents had over 25% lower rates of visiting a dentist in the past year as White non -Hispanic Capital Region residents. Capital Regi on females had 10% higher rates for visiting a dentist in the past year than male residents. Poor oral health negatively impacts a person's general health and well -being. Studies have demonstrated a strong association between periodontal disease and diabetes, heart disease, stroke, pneumonia and adverse pregnancy outcomes, although these relationships are not yet fully understood. The mouth can serve as a portal of entry as well as the site of disease for microbial infections that affect general health. These bacteria can result in extensive localized infections but may also spread to other parts of the body, if the normal barriers of a healthy mouth are breached. Death from complications arising from untreated dental abscesses is rare but does occur. Chronic pain from oral disease can also make eating difficult. Not only does this threaten adequate nutrition, but it also affects a person's ability to function normally.1 Routine dental examinations and prophylaxis are effective prevention measures for improving oral health and reducing the burden of oral disease. Having regular dental visits is an important indicator of general access to quality health care.1 Oral diseases affect a large proportion of the United States population. About 47% of all adults in the United States have some form of periodontal disease.2 In New York State, about 50% of adults have lost one or more teeth due to tooth decay or gum diseases and about 19% of persons 65 years and older have lost all their teeth. Cancers of the mouth and throat are detected in five New Yorkers every day.1 There were over 200,500 adults residing in the Capital Region who did not visit a dentist within the past year. The rates for the six Capital Region Counties fluctuated, from a low in Greene County (67.7%) to a high in Saratoga County (75.5%). Greene, Schenectady and Rensselaer Counties had rates below the Upstate New York rate.3 As with other preventive health care, men are less likely than women to regularly visit a dentist. While 75.4% of Capital Region women visited a dentist, only 69.7% of men did. White non-Hispanic Capital Dentist Visit within the Past Year Among Adults, 2013 -20143 New York State excl. NYC 70.9% Capital Region County 72.6% Greene County 67.7% Healthy Capital District Initiative 58 Region residents had higher annual dental visit rates (72.6%) compared to Black non-Hispanic (53.0%) and Hispanic (67.1%) residents3. Untreated dental disease is more common in populations whose access to oral health care services is limited. These limitations include the inability to pay, inadequate insurance coverage and the lack of available providers including those accepting third party reimbursements like Medicaid. The lack of awareness of the importance of oral health treatment, limited oral health literacy, fears about treatment, transportation issues and language barriers also limit access to adequate oral health care.1 Access to dental care is also particularly problematic for vulnerable populations, such as the institutionalized, the elderly, children with special health care needs, persons with HIV infection, people with low income, adults with mental illness or substance abuse problems, and developmentally disable d or physically challenged children and adults.1 References 1.

Chronic Disease Obesity, Physical Activity and Nutrition Adult Obesity Many of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States are related to poor diet and physical inactivity.1 Being overweight and/or obese is defined as falling into a range of weight that is greater than what is considered healthy for a given height. For adults, obesity ranges are determined by using weight and height to calculate a number called the \"body mass index\" (BMI). An adult with a BMI between 25 and 29.9 is considered overweight, and an adult with a BMI of 30 or higher is considered obese.2 Obesity is caused by a complex interaction of genetic, metabolic, behavioral, social and environmental factors. Obesity is associated with adverse health, social and economic consequences. It is the primary cause of type 2 diabetes; indeed, more than 80% of persons with type 2 d iabetes are overweight or obese. It is also a major contributing factor to heart disease, stroke, cancer, asthma, arthritis, and a number of psychological conditions, including depression.3 Without strong action to reverse the obesity epidemic, for the fir st time in our history children are predicted to have a shorter lifespan than their parents.3 Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 Reduce the percentage of adults ages 18 years and older who are obese to 23.2%. Highlights Schenectady and Greene counties had the highest obesity rates in the Capital Region, with all counties having obesity rates higher than the Prevention Agenda objective. Black non -Hispanic residents had higher obesity rates compared to White non -Hispanic and Hispanic residents. Low income individ uals had higher obesity rates than the general population. Healthy Capital District Initiative 60 All obesity data presented is gathered from the New York State Expanded Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. Survey-based obesity rates are likely under-reported, as self-reported height and weight data has been demonstrated to be lower than measured data in approximately 50% of all cases. The percentage of obese adults in New York State about doubled from 13.9% in 1995 to 27.0% in 2014.4 There were an estimated 196,000 adults who were considered obese in the Capital Region. Of the six Capital District counties, Schenectady County had the highest percent of obese adults. Schenectady County and Greene County had obesity rates that were higher than Upstate New York, with none of the counties meeting the Prevention Agenda objective. All six Capital Region counties experienced an increase in adult obesity from the 2008-2009 BRFSS to the 2013-2014 BRFSS. There was some disparity seen in the Capital Region. Black non-Hispanic residents had higher obesity rates (38.0%) compared to White non-Hispanic (27.7%) and Hispanic (28.0%) residents. There were also differences by socioeconomic status. The Capital Region's 2014 age - adjusted adult obesity rate for individuals with an income less than $25,000/year was 37.6%, higher than for those earning less than $25,000 annually in New York State (28.5%).5 Percentage of Adults Who are Obese (BMI 30) by gender, 2013 -20145 Males Females Prevention Agenda Objective 23.2 % 23.2 % New York State 23.5 % 24.5 % Capital Region 27.4 % 27.9 % Albany 24.6 % 26.8 % Rensselaer 28.6 % 28.4 % Schenectady 33.7 % 33.3 % Saratoga 27.9 % 23.6 % Columbia 20.7 % 30.0 %^ Greene 27.6 %^ 32.9 % Adults Who (BMI 30), 2013 -20146 Prevention Agenda Objective 23.2% ^Highly variable rate (confidence interval with half-width greater than 10) Healthy Capital District Initiative 61 Childhood Obesity The life expectancy of children and adolescents in the United States and New York is significantly reduced due to increasing obesity rates. The prevalence of obesity in the United States has quadrupled since the 1970s among children aged 6-19 years from 5% to 19%, and doubled from 5% to 10% among preschool children aged 2-5 years.3 However, between 2004 and 2012, obesity among children 2-5 years decreased from 14% to 8.1%. 11 For children and teens ages 2-19, overweight and obese are defined differently than for adults.3 Overweight is defined as a BMI at or above the 85th percentile to below the 95th percentile and obese is at or above the 95th percentile on CDC growth charts for children. Additionally, an age - and sex -specific percen tile is used for BMI rather than the BMI categories used for adults. Children's body compositions vary at different ages and vary between boys and girls.3 Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 Reduce the percentage of children and adolescents who are obese so that the percentage of public school children in New York State (outside NYC) who are obese is reduced to 16.7%. Reduce the percentage of WIC children (ages 2 -4) who are obese to 12.4%. Highlights Greene, Schenectady, and Columbia counties had the highest child and adolescent obesity rates. With the exception of Saratoga County , all counties had child and adolescent obesity rates higher than the Prevention Agenda objective. Columbia, and Albany counties had the highest percentage of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children ( WIC) children who were obese; all Capital Region counties had WIC children obesity rates higher than the Prevention Agenda o bjective. Healthy Capital District Initiative 62 The Student Weight Status Category Report provides information from schools on children and adolescent BMI and weight status. Saratoga County is the only Capital District County meeting the Prevention Agenda objective of 16.7% of children with a BMI at or greater than the 95th percentile. Greene County has the highest prevalence, with 20.8% of students classified as obese. Rensselaer, Saratoga, and Greene counties showed slight increases in student obesity rates between 2010-12 and 2012- 14.7 For preschoolers, obesity data are available for children aged 2-4 years from low-income families enrolled in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children (WIC). For the Capital Region, Columbia County had the highest obesity rate for these children at 16.3%, followed by Albany County at 15.1%. No counties in the Capital Region met the Prevention Agenda Objective of 12.4%.6 Prevention Agenda Objective 16.7% 0510152025 17.6 N/A17.9 17.419.5 14.219.120.4 17.3 17.2 17.018.018.8 Children and Are Obese, 2010 -2012 and 2012 -20147 2010-12 2012-14 Healthy Capital District Initiative 63 Prevention Agenda Objective 12.4% Like with adults, childhood obesity is disproportionately distributed among lower-income populations.

Hispanic and Black non -Hispanic NYS residents were less likely to engage in physical activity compared to White non -Hispanic residents. Healthy Capital District Initiative 64 Physical inactivity is a significant factor leading to overweight and obese children and adults. A lack of physical activity can also lead to many chronic diseases or conditions, including hypertension, heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. Physical activity is proven to help maintain a healthy weight and lower the risk of heart disease and related risk factors, diabetes, and premature mortality. It can also help reduce depression and increase cognitive function in older adults. Staying active provides health benefits in all aspects of life.9 Adults need at least 2.5 hours a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (or 75 minutes of vigorous- intensity aerobic activity) and muscle strengthening activity two or more days a week. Prevention Agenda Objective 77.4% Adults 65 and older should follow the adult guidelines as closely as possible. Children and adolescents should be physically active at least 60 minutes daily, and do aerobic, muscle-strengthening, and bone- strengthening activities at least 3 days a week.9 Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 Increase the percentage of adult New Yorkers who engage in some type of leisure time physical activity to at least 77.4%. 64%66%68%70%72%74%76%78%80% 73.8%76.6%78.3% 73.9%77.7% 77.9% 74.3% 69.8%Age-Adjusted Percentage of Adults Who Engaged in Leisure Time Physical Activity, 2012 -20146 Healthy Capital District Initiative 65 There were an estimated 174,500 adults residing in the Capital District who did not engage in any type of leisure time physical activity in the past month. Of the six Capital District counties, Rensselaer, Columbia, and Greene counties did not meet the Prevention Agenda Objective of 77.4% of adults engaging in leisure time physical activity.5 When reviewing 2014 New York State Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, non-Hispanic White residents (79.0%) were more likely to participate in leisure time physical activity during the past month then non-Hispanic Black residents (71.0%) and Hispanic residents (62.8%).16 Sugary Beverages Sugar-sweetened beverages include fruit juices, soda, sports drinks, coffee beverages with sugar, and many others. In the United States, half of the population consumes at least one sugary beverage daily. Many people do not realize how many calories they are taking in with sugary drinks, and cutting sugary beverages out of one's diet is an easy way to reduce daily calo ric intake. For example, one 12 ounce serving of cola has 136 calories and a 20 ounce bottle has 227 calories13. Since the mid- 20th century, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages has increased significantly in the US. Standard soda bottles prior to 1950 were just 6.5 ounces, 1/3 the size of the standard 20 ounce soda bottles we have today14. In 2001, these drinks made up 9% of the daily caloric intake for people in the US. Further, caloric intake from the consumption of sugary beverages does not create a feeling of being \"full,\" and therefore people usually do not compensate by eating less15. Objective New York State Preven tion Agenda 2013 -2018 Decrease the percentage of adults ages 18 and older who consume one or more sugary beverages per day to 19.5% Highlights Rensselaer, Columbia and Schenectady counties had the highest rates of daily consumption of one or more sugary drinks, all rates higher than the Prevention Agenda objective. Hispanics and Black non -Hispanic residents had the highest consumption rates of sugary beverages. Healthy Capital District Initiative 66 Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages has been attributed to increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and gout. Studies in children have found that replacing sugary beverages with non-caloric options, like water, can improve weight management among children who are overweight, and decrease the accumulation of weight and fat in normal-weight children14. About 146,000 Capital Region adults consume sugary beverages daily. Rensselaer, Columbia, and Greene counties did not meet the Prevention Agenda objective of having less than 19.5% of adults consuming sugary drinks daily.6 In the Capital Region and Statewide there are several notable disparities in consumption of sugary beverages by race and ethnicity. In the Capital Region, Hispanics had the highest rate of sugary beverage consumption at 38.5%, followed by Black non-Hispanics at 30.3%. Statewide, including New York City (NYC), Black non-Hispanics had the highest consumption rate at 33.6%, followed by Hispanics at 29.8%.5 References 1.

BRFSS Prevalence and Trend Data http://www.cdc.gov/brfss/brfssprevalence/index.html Healthy Capital District Initiative 68 Tobacco Use Objectives Preventing and reducing tobacco use is a cornerstone of public health. Tobacco use and dependence on tobacco are the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in New York State and in the country. Cigarette use alone results in an estimated 443,000 deaths each year, including 25,400 deaths in New York State.1 In addition to its direct impact on people who smoke, smoking negatively affects non -smok ers in proximity to smokers. Every year, 2,600 New Yorkers die from the effects of second -hand smoke. Secondhand smoke contains hundreds of toxic and cancer -causing chemicals. The Surgeon General has stated that there is no safe level of exposure to second hand smoke. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has classified secondhand smoke as a known human carcinogen (cancer -causing agent).1 There are 389,000 children alive today who will die prematurely from second hand smoke. Many more children ex posed to secondhand smoke will suffer from respiratory illnesses, including bronchitis and pneumonia, asthma, and eye and ear problems.1 More than half a million New Yorkers currently have a disease caused by smoking, resulting in about $8.17 billion in health care expenditures annually. Tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure causes heart disease and stroke; chronic lung disease; cancers of the lung, mouth, pharynx, esophagus, and bladders; Highlights Rensselaer, Greene and Columbia counties had the highest current smoking rates in the Capital Region, but all counties had rates higher than the Prevention Agenda objective. Only Albany and Columbia counties experienced a decrease in smoking rates from 2008 - 09 to 2013 -14. Hispanic and Black non -Hispanic residents had higher smoking rates than their White non-Hispanic counterparts did. Males had higher smoking rates than female residents did. Low socioeconomic residents as w ell as residents with poor mental health had higher smoking rates than the general population. New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 Decrease the prevalence of cigarette smoking by adults to 12.3%. Decrease the prevalence of cigarette smoking among adults who report poor mental health to 26.5% . Healthy Capital District Initiative 69 and other lung and vascular diseases. Tobacco use during pregnancy leads to poor birth outcomes and increases the chances for sudden infant death syndrome .1 In the Capital Region, there were approximately 141,000 adult current smokers ages 18 years and older. The prevalence of current smokers was highest in Rensselaer County, followed by Greene and Columbia counties. With the exception of Albany County, all counties in the Capital Region had higher current smoking rates compared to Upstate New York, with all six counties having rates higher than the Prevention Agenda objective of 12.3%.2 Smoking rates in Rensselaer, Schenectady, Saratoga, and Greene counties have increased since N/A16.518.6 17.4 16.924.7 24.3 Smoke3 2008-09 2013-14 Preventio n Agenda Objective 12.3 % Healthy Capital District Initiative 70 In the Capital Region, the prevalence of cigarette smoking was highest among Hispanics, followed by Black non-Hispanics, White non-Hispanics, and other non-Hispanics.3 In the Capital Region, males had higher current smoking rates (21.1%) compared to females (17.2%). Capital Region current smoking rates also vary by socioeconomic status: 39.8% of individuals with incomes <$25,000 currently smoke, compared to the overall rate of 19.7% in the region.3 Additionally, those who report poor mental health also have higher rates of smoking. Neither New York State nor the Capital Region met the Prevention Agenda objective of 26.5% smoking prevalence for this population. Sample sizes were too small within the Capital Region counties to extrapolate smoking rates among adults who report poor mental health. Smoking is a special problem among youth. Nearly 80% of tobacco users begin before age 18. According to the New York State Department of Health, the smoking prevalence in youth decreased from 27.1% in 2000 to 7.3% in 2014.5 At the same time, it is likely youth are engaging in other tobacco use behaviors such as electronic cigarettes and using hookahs.4 Age-Adjusted Current Smoking Among Adults who Report Poor Mental Health3 Prevention Agenda Objective 26.5% New York State 29.9% Capital the Capital Region, by Race/Ethnicity, 2013 -20143 Healthy Capital District Initiative 71 References 1.

Black non -Hispanics had the highest rates of COPD/CLRD hospitalizations rates in the Capital Region. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or chronic lower respiratory disease (CLRD), is a lung disease that makes it harder to breathe over time as the tubes that carry air into and out of the lungs are partially blocked or damaged. It is a group of diseases and includes emphysema, chronic bronchitis, or a combination of these and can coexist with asthma. The severity of COPD/CLRD can vary, but when severe, it can affect the most basic tasks and daily living.1,2 Early detection of COPD/CLRD might alter its course and progress. A simple spirometry test can detect COPD/CLRD before the symptoms become severe1. In the United States, a history of current or former tobacco use is a key factor in the development and progression of COPD/CLRD. Smoking accounts for 8 out of 10 COPD-related deaths.3 COPD/CLRD is the third leading cause of death in the United States, as well as in the Capital Region. It is estimated that there are over 11 million people living with COPD in the United States, with an estimated 24 million who may have the disease without knowing. In addition, COPD/CLRD is an important cause of hospitalization in older populations. 4 In 2013 there were over 2,900 hospitalizations due to COPD/CLRD in the Capital Region. The highest rate was in Rensselaer County with 33.7/10,000. All Capital Region counties had rates lower than that of Upstate New York (34.1).5 05101520253035 28.627.628.333.7 26.9 22.529.828.6Age-Adjusted COPD/CLRD Hospitalization Rates per 10,000, 2011 -20135 Healthy Capital District Initiative 73 There were over 470 deaths due to COPD/CLRD in the Capital Region. Rensselaer County has the highest mortality rate in the Capital Region, with 50.0/100,000, exceeding the Upstate New York rate of 30.7. All Capital Region counties have mortality rates higher than Upstate New York. There was a racial/ethnic disparity in the COPD/CLRD hospitalization rates. Across the Capital Region, Black non- Hispanics had the highest hospitalization rates due to COPD/CLRD, when compared to White non-Hispanics and Hispanics. References 1.

Albany County had the highest rate of asthma hospitalizations for all ages and for ages 0 -17 years in the Capital Region. Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 By December 31, 2018, reduce the asthma emergency department visit rate to: - 156.9 per 10,000 for residents ages 0 -4 years. - 65.4 per 10,000 for residents ages 5 -64 years. - 22.3 per 10,000 for residents 65 years and older. - 75.1 per 10,000 for residents of all ages. By December 31, 2018, reduce the asthma hospital discharge rate: - 38.5 per 10,000 for residents ages 0 -4 years. - 11.9 per 10,000 for residents ages 5 -64 years. - 25.8 per 10,000 for residents ages 65 years and older. Asthma is a disease that affects the lungs and is characterized by difficulty breathing. In most cases the causes of asthma are not known. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing, tightness in the chest, breathlessness, and coughing at night or early in the morning. It is one of the most common long-term diseases of children, but is prevalent in adults as well.1 Nationwide, about 6.3 million children, or 8.6% of children, and 17.7 million adults, or 7.4% of adults, are living with asthma.2 In New York State, more than 1.1 million adults and 1 in 13 school-aged children have asthma.3 An asthma attack is a distressing and potentially life-threatening experience. When an attack occurs, the sides of the airways in the lungs swell, causing the airways to shrink. As a result, less air is able to able to get in and out of the lungs. If poorly treated, asthma can lead to persistent hospitalization and possibly death. Triggers for an asthma attack vary from person to person. Some triggers include tobacco smoke, dust mites, outdoor air pollution, cockroach allergen, pets, mold and smoke from burning wood or grass.1 Healthy Capital District Initiative 75 Asthma can interfere with daily activities, especially without proper management and treatment. Asthma is the leading cause of missed days of school for children. Parents are also affected, as they frequently miss days of work due to their child's asthma. About 1 in 3 adults with asthma also miss at least one work day per year.4 Direct and indirect health care costs due to asthma add up to $56 billion yearly in the United States.4 Adults are less likely than children to receive care when cost is an issue. Cost also prevents routine doctor visits and medicine use, which makes asthma management difficult.2 Asthma is a major health concern for the Capital Region. In the Capital Region, there were an estimated 85,825 adults living with asthma as of 2013. Greene and Rensselaer counties has the highest adult current asthma prevalence rates in the Region.5 In addition, there were over 4,000 emergency room visits due to asthma complications and flare-ups. All Capital Region counties fall below the New York State Prevention Agenda objective of 75.1/10,000 emergency department visits due to asthma. The highest rate was in Schenectady County, with a rate of 69.6/10,000. Saratoga, Columbia and Greene counties were all below the rate of Upstate New York and the Prevention Agenda objective.6 Age-Adjusted Percentage of Adults, Ages 18+ with Current Asthma, Capital Region, 2013 - 20145 Upstate New York 10.5% Capital Region 11.7% 61.269.6 23.536.0 25.6Age-Adjusted Asthma Emergency Department Visit Rate per 10,000 population, 20136 Prevention Agenda Objective (75.1) Healthy Capital District Initiative 76 Children ages 0-4 years had the highest asthma ED visit rates of any age group. The highest rate in the Capital Region was in Rensselaer County, with 199.7/10,000. Rensselaer and Albany counties were the only Capital Region counties with rates above the Prevention Agenda objective (156.9), with rates of 199.7 and 184.3 respectively.7 Severe asthma attacks and complications may lead to hospitalizations. Hospitalizations usually indicate a lack of properly managing the condition. A combination of early medical intervention and the avoidance of asthma triggers can help to prevent such severe flare-ups. With the exception of Albany County, all Capital Region counties had hospitalization rates below the Upstate New York rate, 10.9/10,000.

Diabetes is a serious public health concern. Nearly 29 million people in the United States are estimated to have diabetes, over 9% of the population. Another 86 million people, one -third of the population, are estimated to be at risk of diabetes, commonly referred to as pre -diabetics.1 Diabetes is a group of diseases marked by high levels of blood glucose resulting from defects in insulin production, insulin action, or both. There are two major type of diabetes: type 1 and type 2. Type 2 diabetes, or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), accounts for about 90% to 95% of all diagnosed cases of diabetes. This type of diabetes has become more prevalent in the United States, particularly among minorities. According to recent studies, type 2 d iabetes, formerly called \"adult\" diabetes, is being seen with alarming frequency among children.1 The total cost of diabetes and prediabetes in the United States is $322 billion per year. Approximately 20% of dollars spent on health care are spent caring for people with diabetes. Medical costs for people Highlights Greene and Rensselaer counties had the highest adult diabetes prevalence in the Capital Region. Only Schenectady and Saratoga counties experienced a decrease in the diabetes prevalence between 2008 -09 and 2013 -14. Rensselaer and Schenectady counties had the highest diabetes mortality rates in the Capital Region. Schenectady and Albany counties had the highest diabetes ED visit rates, and with Rensselaer County, the highest hospitalization rates in the Capital Region. Schenectady, Rensselaer and Albany counties had the highest diabetes short -term complication hospitalization rates, with only Greene and Saratoga counties having rates that met the Prevention Agenda objective. Black non -Hispanic residents had 2.6 times the diabetes mortality rate, 3.6 times the diabetes hospitalization rate, and 4 times the diabetes short -term complication hospitalization rate compared to White non -Hispanic residents. Males had 1.4 times the diabet es hospitalization rates than female Capital Region residents. Healthy Capital District Initiative 80 Prevention Agenda Objective 4.9 per 10,000 with diabetes are 2.3 times higher than those without. These costs could be considerably reduced and important personal benefits realized by diabetics choosing to make some lifestyle changes.2 The prevalence of diabetes among adults in the Capital Region is slightly above the Upstate New York rate. An estimated 70,700 adults in the Capital District have been diagnosed with diabetes. Adults in Greene County had the highest prevalence of adult diabetes in 2013-2014. Capital Region counties, with the exception of Schenectady and Columbia counties, had adult diabetes prevalence higher than the Upstate New York. The Capital Region counties, except Schenectady and Saratoga counties, have shown an increase in adult diabetes prevalence from 2008-09 and 2013-14. Short-term complications of diabetes are a result of extreme fluctuation in blood sugar levels. They include: hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), diabetic hyperosmolar syndrome (high blood sugar) and diabetic ketoacidosis (increased blood acids).4 Age-Adjusted Percentage of Adults who Have Diabetes3 2008 -09 2013 -14 Upstate New York 8.5% 10.2 % 0123456789 5.86.26.67.58.5 4.1 4.8 3.6Rate of Diabetes Short -Term Complication Hospitalizations per 10,000, 2011 -20135 Healthy Capital District Initiative 81 In 2013, there were 470 diabetes short-term complications hospitalizations for Capital Region residents 18 years of age and older. The diabetes short-term complication hospitalization rate for Albany, Rensselaer and Schenectady counties exceeded the Upstate New York, rate and did not meet the Prevention Agenda objective for the 18+ age group.8 Capital Region Black non-Hispanic short-tern complications hospitalizations rates for the 18+ year population were four times the rates of their White non-Hispanic counterparts ( 19.3 vs. 4.5).6 The Capital Region had lower Emergency Department (ED) and hospitalizations rates compared to Upstate New York from 2011-2013. There were 1,423 ED visits and 1,317 hospitalizations to Capital Region residents in 2013 where diabetes was the primary diagnosis.

Black non-Hispanic Capital Region residents have 3.6 times higher the rate of diabetes hospitalizations than White non-Hispanic residents (35.8 vs. 10.0). The Capital District averages 179 diabetes deaths per year. The 2011-2013 diabetes mortality rates were highest in Rensselaer and Schenectady counties with rates slightly higher than Upstate New York.8 In the Capital Region, Black non-Hispanic (37.5 per 100,000) residents have diabetes mortality rates 2.6 times as high as White non-Hispanics (14.4).8 References 1.

Schenectady, Greene and Columbia counties do not meet the Prevention Agenda objective for heart attack hospitalization rates. Schenectady County had the highest coronary heart disease hospitalization rate, while Columbia and Greene counties had the highest coronary heart disease mortality rates. Schenectady County had the highest congestive heart failure hospitalization rate, while Rensselaer County had the highest mortality rate. Schenectady County had the highest stroke hospitalization rate, while Schenectady and Saratoga counties had the highest stroke mortality rates. Males and Black non -Hispanics had higher rates for most of th e cardiovascular indicators across all Capital Region counties. Cardiovascular disease refers to a group of diseases that affect the heart and the circulatory system. Almost 610,000 Americans die from cardiovascular diseases each year, which is 1 in every 4 deaths. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease include high blood pressure, high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and smoking, of which 49% of Americans live with at least one of the three.1 More than one third of the population live with some form of cardiovascular disease. These diseases take more lives than the next five leading causes of death combined (cancer, chronic lower respiratory diseases, injuries, diabetes and influenza/pneumonia).2 In New York State, Cardiovascular disease killed almost 43,000 residents in 2013 alone.3 Heart Attack and Coronary Heart Disease Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 By December 31, 2018, reduce the age -adjusted hospitalization rate for heart attack to 14.0 per 10,000 residents of a ll ages. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in New York State as well as in the Capital Region. Residents of New York State are 29% more likely to die from coronary heart disease than the next leading cause of death. 4 Coronary heart disease is a disorder that affects the coronary arteries (blood vessels that supply blood to the heart) and the heart muscle. A serious consequence of coronary heart disease is a heart attack, which occurs when the supply of blood to the heart is greatly reduced or stopped due to blockage in a coronary artery and the heart muscle is damaged.5 It is estimated that 15.5 million adults in the U.S. have coronary heart disease. Coronary heart disease makes up more than half of the cardiovascular events that occur in men and women <75 years of age.3 Healthy Capital District Initiative 85 Every 34 seconds, an American will suffer coronary event, and about every minute someone will die from one.2 The Capital Region had over 1,500 heart attack hospitalizations in 2013. Schenectady County had the highest heart attack hospitalization rate in the region, with 18.6/10,000 persons. While the Capital Region falls below the Prevention Agenda objective, Schenectady, Columbia and Greene counties all have rates higher than the objective.6 In 2013, there were over 2,500 hospitalizations due to coronary heart disease in the Capital Region. All Capital Region counties had CHD hospitalization rates lower than that of Upstate New York. CHD rates have decreased over the past decade for Upstate New York and the Capital Region counties.7 Age-Adjusted Coronary Heart Disease Hospitalization Rate per 10,000, 2011 -20137 Upstate New York 32.6 Capital Region 22.8 Albany County 19.0 Rensselaer County 24.6 Schenectady County 29.6 Saratoga County 21.3 Columbia County 22.6 Greene County 25.5 05101520 15.2 13.211.012.418.6 11.614.516.2Age-Adjusted Heart Attack Hospitalization Rates per 10,000, 20136 Prevention Agenda Objective (14.0/10,000) Healthy Capital District Initiative 86 When comparing coronary heart disease hospitalization rates by race/ethnicity, there is a clear disparity in which Black non-Hispanics had higher rates. Only for Saratoga County was the CHD hospitalization rate for Black non-Hispanics lower than that of Hispanics and White non- Hispanics. In Upstate New York, Hispanics had the highest rate of CHD of the three race/ethnicity groups, but across the Capital Region, Hispanics had the lowest rates.8 In 2013, there were over 1,440 deaths due to coronary heart disease in the Capital Region. All Capital Region counties had CHD mortality rates lower than that of Upstate New York, with the exception of Columbia and Greene counties.9 Age-Adjusted Coronary Heart Disease Hospitalization Rate per 10,000 by Race/Ethnicity, 2011 -20138 White non - Hispanic Black non - Hispanic Hispanic Upstate New York 29.5 33.0 34.0 Albany County 17.7 25.4 9.5 Rensselaer County 23.6 28.0 19.7 Schenectady County 27.7 32.5 19.6 Saratoga County 17.0 12.7 12.1 Columbia County 21.1 26.9 22.3 Greene County 23.7 26.5 S S: Data do not meet criteria for confidentiality Age-Adjusted Coronary Heart Disease Mortality Rate per 100,000, 2011 -20139 Upstate New York 131.6 Capital Region 120.8 Albany County Rensselaer County County County 147.1 Greene County 134.8 Healthy Capital District Initiative 87 Congestive Heart Failure Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a specific category of cardiovascular disease (CVD), like coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease (stroke). In contrast, to these two diseases, CHF is not one of the leading causes of death in the state;4 however, it is one of the fastest growing subgroups of CVD, making it a cause for concern and attention. CHF affects about 5.1 million people within the United States. It is the primary cause of over 55,000 deaths and a contributing cause of approximately 280,000 deaths yearly.10 CHF accounts for 2% of all deaths in New York State and 4% of all CVD deaths; however, the prevalence of CHF has been increasing over the last 20 years.4 CHF is a disorder where the heart loses its ability to pump blood efficiently, causing fatigue and shortness of breath. CHF is not a single disease, but the result of different types of heart and artery diseases, including Coronary Artery Disease, Heart Attacks, Cardiomyopathy, High Blood Pressure, Irregular Heart Valves, Abnormal Heart Rhythms, and Blood Clots.11 The most common causes of congestive heart failure are Coronary Artery Disease, High Blood Pressure and Diabetes. About half of people who develop CHF die within 5 years of diagnosis.10 In 2013, the Capital Region had over 2,400 hospitalizations due to congestive heart failure. Of the Capital Region counties, Schenectady County has the highest rate of congestive heart failure hospitalizations, with 25.4/10,000. It is the only county with a rate higher than Upstate New York.12 05101520253023.420.8 20.421.425.4 18.2 18.420.2Age-Adjusted Congestive Heart Failure Hospitalization Rate per 10,000, 2011 -201312 Healthy Capital District Initiative 88 Over 225 deaths occurred due to congestive heart failure in 2013 in the Capital Region, its mortality rate higher than Upstate New York. Rensselaer County has the highest rate in the Capital Region with 22.0/100,000.13 When comparing race/ethnicity across the Capital Region, White non-Hispanics have higher mortality rates of congestive heart failure than Black non-Hispanics and Hispanics. 14 Cerebrovascular Disease Cerebrovascular disease, or stroke, is the fifth leading cause of death in the United State and is a major cause of adult disability. Each year, 130,000 Americans are killed by stroke. In the United States, someone has a stroke every forty seconds and dies from a stroke every four minutes.15 Stroke occurs when a blood vessel, which brings oxygen and nutrients to the brain, bursts or is blocked by a blood clot or some other particle. With this rupture or blockage, part of the brain does not get the blood and oxygen it needs. Deprived of oxygen, nerve cells in the affected area of the brain die within minutes.16 Some risk factors for stroke are uncontrollable, such as heredity, age, gender, and ethnicity. Other conditions such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, smoking, being overweight or obese, and previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, can increase your risk of stroke.15 In addition to fatal outcome, stroke can result in serious long-term disability. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stroke costs the nation $34 billion annually including cost of health care services, medications and lost productivity.15 In the Capital Region, there were over 2,300 hospitalizations due to stroke in 2013. The Capital Region's stroke hospitalization rate was lower than Upstate New York. All Capital Region counties had hospitalization rates below Upstate New York (23.6/10,000), with the exception of Schenectady County (24.1). 17 Age-Adjusted Congestive Heart Failure Mortality Rate per 100,00013 Upstate New York 16.1 Capital Region 17.7 Albany County 19.0 Rensselaer County 22.0 Schenectady County 18.1 Saratoga County 13.9 Columbia County 13.4 Greene County 16.1 Age-Adjusted Cerebrovascular Disease (Stroke) Hospitalization Rate per 10,000, 2011 -201317 Upstate New York 23.6 Capital Region 21.4 Albany County 21.0 Rensselaer County 22.0 Schenectady County 24.1 Saratoga County 19.7 Columbia County 20.0 Greene County 23.4 Healthy Capital District Initiative 89 There were almost 350 deaths due to stroke in 2013 in the Capital Region, its mortality rate is slightly higher than Upstate New York.

It can be caused by many different factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, and the environment. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in New York State, as well as in the Capital Region. Each year, about 105,000 New Yorkers are diagnosed with cancer and over 35,000 New Yorkers die from malignant cancers each year. Lung, colorectal, breast and prostate cancers account for the majority of cancers in New York and nationally.1 Many cancer deaths are preventable through early detection. For several types of cancer, detection at an early stage significantly increases the options for treatment and its overall success. \"Early stage\" is defined as identifying invasive cancers before they have spread from the tissue of origin. Cancer screening helps to identify cancers at an early stage before the onset of clinical symptoms.1 In general, gender and race are important factors in the frequency of different types of cancers. At all ages, women have lower cancer incidence and mortality rates than men in the same age group. This gender difference has remained stable over time in New York State.1 Highlights Greene, Albany and Columbia counties had the lowest breast cancer screening rates in the Capital Region, and lower rates compared to Upstate NY. The Capital Region had lower breast cancer incidence rates compared to Upstate NY, but higher rates of late stage breast cancer incidence. Albany, Greene and Saratoga counties had the highest late stage breast cancer incidence, as well as breast cancer mortality in the Capital R egion. Black non -Hispanic women had higher last stage breast cancer incidence than White non - Hispanic or Hispanic residents. Greene and Columbia counties had the lowest cervical cancer screening rates, but all capital Region counties had screening rates below Upstate NY. Columbia and Schenectady counties had the lowest colorectal screening rates in the Capital Region, with only Albany and Saratoga counties meeting the Prevention Agenda objective. Compared to Upstate NY, the Capital Region had higher colorectal cancer incidence and mortality rates, with Columbia and Greene counties having the highest incidence and mortality rates. With the exception of Green e County , all Capital Region counties had prostate cancer mortality rates higher than Upstate NY. The Capital Region had higher lung cancer mortality rates than Upstate NY, with Rensselaer, Columbia and Greene counties having the highest incidence and mort ality rates in the Capital Region. Healthy Capital District Initiative 92 Female Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States, exceeded only by lung cancer. All women are at risk for breast cancer. Men can also get breast cancer, but this is rare. In New York State, about 14,500 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year.1 Behavioral risk factors amenable to change include obesity after menopause, heavy consumption of alcohol and, possibly, high-fat diets and lack of exercise. Reproductive factors, including having a first child after age 30 and never having children, increase the risk of breast cancer. These identified risk factors, however, do not explain the high frequency of the disease in the population.2 Around 80% of breast cancer cases occur in women over the age of 50. Women who have regular mammograms beginning at age 50 can reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer by nearly 30%. Screening for breast cancer allows early identification and treatment and is the primary way of reducing mortality. It is recommended that all women perform monthly self-breast exams and have routine clinical breast exams.3 The most recent screening guidelines in New York State recommend women between the ages of 50 and 74 receive a screening mammogram every two years. Women at a higher risk of breast cancer may need to begin screening earlier.4 In 2013-2014, 79% of women ages 50-74 and older in the Capital Region reported having had a mammogram within the past two years which was comparable to the Upstate New York rate of 80.5%. Only Rensselaer and Saratoga counties had higher screening rates than Upstate New York. Greene and Albany counties had the lowest breast cancer screening rates in the Capital Region.7 The fatality of invasive breast cancer is strongly influenced by the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Early detection of breast cancer plays a significant role in the reduction of breast cancer mortality.

Late stage diagnosis only has a 23.3% 5- year survival rate.3 The region had approximately 800 cases of female breast cancer cases a year, about 250 with late diagnosis between 2010 and 2012. The Capital Region had a lower incidence rate of female breast cancer than Upstate New York, but a higher late stage diagnosis rate. Albany and Greene counties had the highest incidence of late stage breast cancer diagnosis in the Capital Region.7 All the Capital Region counties, with the exception of Columbia County, had age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rates that were slightly higher than the Upstate New York rate. Greene County had the highest age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rate at 28.7/100,000.7 In New York State, Black non-Hispanic women had higher late- stage incidence (49.9/100,000) when compared to White non- Hispanic women (43.2) and Hispanic women (30.8). Black non- Hispanic women also had a higher mortality rate (26.7) compared to the White non-Hispanic (21.0) and Hispanic (14.2) populations.6 Age-Adjusted Female Breast Cancer Mortality Rate per 100,000, 2010 - 20127 New York State, excl.

Almost all cervical cancers are caused by (HPV), a common sexually- transmitted disease. When found at an early stage, cervical cancer is highly treatable.9 In the United States, approximately 12,000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 4,000 women die from the disease each year.9 In New York State, about 800 cases are diagnosed and almost 300 women die from cervical cancer annually.7 In the Capital Region, 30 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2012 and there were 7 deaths in the same time period.7 Several factors have been identified that place women at increased risk of developing cervical cancer. The strongest risk factor is unsafe sexual practices, including having multiple partners and having a history of sexually transmitted diseases. Smoking, giving birth to three or more children, and using birth control for five or more years are also risk factors.9 The Pap test (or Pap smear) is an effective screening test that can detect cervical cell abnormalities that, without treatment, could lead to cancer. This test can detect cervical cancer in situ , an early stage of cervical cancer, where the cells are changing in shape and organization but are still localized and have not spread. Pap tests are recommended every three years for women ages 21-65. Regular Pap screenings decrease the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer by at least 80%.11 In New York State, the cervical screening recommendation is that women should start getting Pap tests at the age of 21 and have them every 3 years, more frequently if there is an abnormal finding, and Pap tests and HPV tests every five years between the ages of 30 and 65.12 During 2013-2014, the percentage of women 21 years of age and older, having a Pap test within the past three years in the Capital Region is lower than the Upstate New York rate.5 All Capital Region counties have screening rates lower than Upstate New York, with Columbia and Greene counties having the lowest screening rates. The rate of new cervical cancers in the Capital District is lower than the Upstate New York.

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in men and women. It is also the second leading cause of death from cancers that affect both men and women.13 Each year, about 10,000 adults in New York State are diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and 90% of them are over age 50.1 Routine screening can reduce colorectal cancer deaths by at least 60%.13 When colorectal cancer is diagnosed in its earliest stage, 90.1% of individuals live five years after diagnosis. In comparison, for late stage diagnosis the five year survival rate dramatically decreases to 9.2%.1 Lifestyle factors that contribute to increased risk of colorectal cancer include lack of regular physical activity, low fruit and vegetable intake, a low-fiber and high-fat diet, overweight and obesity, alcohol consumption and tobacco use.14 Colorectal cancer screening is recommended for men and women aged 50 -75 using high-sensitivity fecal occult blood testing (FOBT), sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy.15 During 2013-2014, only Albany and Saratoga counties met the Prevention Agenda objective.5 Of the Capital Region counties, Columbia County had the lowest colorectal cancer screening rate.5 Prevention Agenda Objective 71.4% 0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80% 71.7% 59.3%67.8%Percentage of Adults who Received Colorectal Cancer Screening Ages 50 -75 years, 2013 -201416 Healthy Capital District Initiative 96 Colorectal cancer incidence is higher in the Capital Region than Upstate New York, with the region averaging 480 cases per year. With the exception of Schenectady County, all counties in the Capital Region had higher incidence rates Upstate New York. There were differences in incidence by gender and race in Upstate New York. Males had higher colorectal cancer incidence than females (48.4 vs. 38.2 per 100,000). Black non-Hispanics had the highest incidence (44.4), followed by White non-Hispanics (41.7) and Hispanics (33.4).6 The rate of colorectal cancer mortality in the Capital Region is slightly higher than the Upstate New York rate. Columbia County has the highest rate of mortality (19.3/10,000) while Saratoga County (11.0) has the lowest rate.7 Because of the small numbers, race/ethnicity information for colorectal cancer is not available for all Capital Region counties. For Upstate New York, Black non- Hispanic residents had a 2011- 2013 colorectal cancer mortality rate of 16.0 per 100,000, which was higher than the White non- Hispanic rate of 14.0 per 100,000.6 Prostate Cancer Prostate cancer is the most common form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer mortality in men. In New York State, around 15,600 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer annually and there are about 1,700 deaths due to prostate cancer each year.1 Age-Adjusted Colorectal Cancer Incidence Rate per 100,000, 2010 -20127 Upstate New York 41.2 Capital Region 43.5 Albany County 43.5 Rensselaer County 45.0 Schenectady County 37.3 Saratoga 51.8 County 46.2 05101520Age-Adjusted Colorectal Mortality per 100,000, 2010 -20127 13.9 14.3 14.2 15.5 15.4 11.0 19.3 16.7 Healthy Capital District Initiative 97 The causes and risk factors for prostate cancer are not well understood. The chance of having prostate cancer greatly increases after age 50. Black men are over twice as likely to have prostate cancer, be diagnosed at a late state, and die of prostate cancer as White males. A family history of prostate cancer also increases the risk of getting the disease.17 Routine screening for prostate cancer is not recommended for men without symptoms. While screening can detect cancer at an early stage, the benefits of prostate cancer screening do not outweigh the risks. The presence of other health conditions can cause false positive test results. Additionally, some men have prostate cancer that never affects their health; they die from other health conditions. In these cases, the mild to serious sid e effects from treatment of prostate cancer are more harmful than the cancer itself.18 The Capital Region averages 580 cases of prostate cancer annually. All Capital Region counties had age- adjusted prostate cancer incidence rates below the Upstate average, with Albany County having the highest rate.7 There were an average of 110 prostate cancer deaths per year in the Capital Region from 2010-2012. In contrast with Capital Region prostate cancer incidence, all Capital Region counties, except for Greene County, had prostate cancer mortality rates higher than New York State, excluding NYC. Saratoga County had the highest prostate cancer mortality rate of the Capital Region counties.7 Prostate cancer mortality has been decreasing in New York State over the last decade. The New York State age-adjusted mortality rate has decreased 30% from 26.5 per 100,000 in 2003 to 18.8 in 2012.7 Lung Cancer Lung cancer continues to be a serious public health concern. More people die from lung cancer than any other type of cancer. This is true for both men and women. According to the CDC, as of 2016 lung cancer was the number one cause of death due to cancer and the second overall cause of death.19 Age-Adjusted Prostate Canc er Incidence Rate per 100,000, 2010 -20127 Upstate 144.1 Capital Region 114.7 Albany County County 108.5 Greene County 127.1 Age-Adjusted Prostate Cancer Mortality Rate per 100,000, 2010 - 20127 Upstate New York 18.5 Capital Region 20.8 Albany County 22.0 Rensselaer County 21.9 Schenectady County 22.0 Saratoga County 23.4 Columbia County 22.4 Greene County 14.0 Healthy Capital District Initiative 98 The Capital Region averages 900 lung cancer cases a year. Lung cancer incidence in all Capital Region counties, with the exception of Schenectady County, exceeded the Upstate New York rate. Rensselaer County had the highest incidence of lung cancer.7 The Capital Region averages 580 lung cancer deaths per year. All Capital Region counties have lung cancer mortality rates higher than Upstate New York, with Greene, Columbia, and Rensselaer counties having the highest rates. Between 2008-2010 and 2010-2012 most counties did not see a significant change in mortality rates. However, Columbia County had a 10% increase (53.7 to 59.6/100,000), Schenectady County had a 16% decrease (55.5 to 46.4/100,000), Saratoga County had an 11% decrease (56.0 to 50.0/100,000).7 References 1. 2012-2017 New York State Comprehensive Cancer Control Plan http://www.nyscancerconsortium.org/documents/NYSCompCancerPlan2012-2017-FINAL.pdf 2.

Healthy and Safe Environment Lead Poisoning Highlights In the Capital Region, 5,250 children born in 2010 did not have one lead screening by 18 months of age and 7,000 children born in 2010 did not have two lead screenings by 36 months of age. All counties had decreases in their 18 m onth screening rates from 2007 to 2010. Columbia County had the highest incidence rate of elevated blood lead levels in children under 6 years of age With the exception of Saratoga County, all Capital Region counties had incidence rates of elevated blood l ead levels higher than Upstate New York. Lead poisoning is a completely preventable public health problem. Lead is a heavy metal that was used in many products and materials before the risk to young children was identified. For example, paint containing lead was used in many houses built before 1978.1 Products that can be hazardous still remain. Lead is also found in air, water, soil, or dust. Lead poisoning leads to serious adverse health, developmental, and cognitive outcomes that can affect individuals throughout their lives.2 Lead Screening Approximately, 400 million children in the United States live in housing that is increasing their risk of lead exposure. Since such a high percentage of children are at risk, routine screening for elevated blood lead levels at 1 year and 2 years of age is important. Children found to be at risk must also have blood lead testing. Early identification of lead exposure can prevent harm and minimize further exposures.3 Lead poisoning often occurs with no obvious symptoms. Therefore, it is important to screen children for elevated blood lead levels before they are harmed. Screening is performed by physicians using a blood draw or a finger prick. In New York State, healthcare providers are required to obtain a blood test on all children at 1 and 2 years of age. In addition, children age 6 months to 6 years are required to be assessed annually as a part of routine care and a blood lead level obtained for any child with an increased risk of exposure.1 Healthy Capital District Initiative 101 In the Capital Region, 5,250 children born in 2010 did not have at least one lead screening test done by 18 months of age, and over 7,000 did not have two lead screenings by 36 months.4 With the exception of Schenectady County (58.3%), all other counties in the Capital Region had 18 month lead screening rates lower than Upstate NY. Greene County had the lowest rate of all the counties, 27.5%. All Capital Region counties had rates below those of Upstate NY for children with two lead screenings by 36 months. Saratoga County had the lowest rate in the Capital Region at 18.7%. When comparing the 2007 and 2010 birth cohorts, all counties had decreases in their 18 month screening rates: Albany County, (59.3% to 51.0%), Rensselaer to 50.3%) and Greene County (39.4% to 27.5%). Children Younger than 6 Years with Elevated Lead Levels In New York State, the leading environmental poison of young children is lead. Children under the age of six, but particularly children living at or below the poverty line in older housing, are at risk1. While both incidence and severity of childhood lead poisoning have steadily decreased in New York State, it is still a serious public health concern. In 2013, more than 3,200 children under age six were newly identified with blood lead levels (BLLs) 10 micrograms per deciliter (\u00b5g/dl) and above; 80 percent resided in just 13 of the states' poorest counties with the oldest housing stock 3 New York State ranks high consistently in many of the factors associated with childhood lead poisoning, such as childhood poverty, large immigrant populations and an older, deteriorated housing stock. The main cause of lead poisoning among children is exposure to paint chips and dust from deteriorating lead-based paint in their homes.3 Percentage of Ch ildren Born in 2010 with At Least One Lead Screening by 9 -17 months or 2 Lead Screenings by 36 months, 2011 -20134 9-17 months 18-36 months Upstate (NYS excl. NYC) County County 36.1 18.7 Columbia County 50.3 32.9 Greene County 27.5 27.9 Healthy Capital District Initiative 102 Annually, an average of 246 children under the age of six living in the Capital Region have confirmed blood lead levels at or above 10\u00b5g/dl. Columbia County had the highest incidence rate of elevated blood lead levels with 15.4 per 1,000 children tested, followed by Albany County with a rate of 15.0 per 1,000 children tested. Of the Capital Region counties, only Saratoga County had a rate lower than Upstate New York. References 1.

Greene County had the highest rate of hospitalizations due to motor vehicle accidents; Schenectady County had the highest rate of ED visits due to motor vehicle accidents. Except for Saratoga and Greene counties , all Capital Region counties had child fall ED visit rates above the Prevention Agenda objective. Rensselaer County was the only Capital Region County not meeting the Prevention Agenda objective for fall hospitalizations to the elderly. Columbia and Saratoga counties had the highest rates of occupational injuries treated in ED for adolescents ages 15 -19; both were above the Prevention Agenda objective. Motor Vehicle-Related Injuries Motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death from injury in the United States. Motor vehicle- related injuries kill more children and young adults than any other single cause in the United States. More than 2.5 million drivers and passengers were treated in emergency departments as the result of being injured in motor vehicle crashes in 2012.1 Motor vehicle injuries cause death, trauma, impairment, higher insurance premiums, productivity loss at work, and other costs to individuals, their families and communities. In a one year period, medical care and productivity costs associated with motor vehicle crashes exceeded $80 billion.1 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.0 7.67.2 4.47.6 6.09.712.312.8Age-Adjusted Motor Vehicle Mortality Rate per 100,000, 2011 -20132 Healthy Capital District Initiative 104 In the Capital Region, the more rural counties of Columbia, Greene and Saratoga had age-adjusted motor vehicle mortality rates that were above the Upstate NY rates. The highest rate was in Greene County, with 12.8/10,000, followed by Columbia County (12.3). For age-adjusted motor vehicle accidents, the highest rate of hospitalizations was in Greene County, with a rate of 10.4/10,000. For ED visits, Schenectady County had the highest rate, with 93.4. These rates are all lower than those previously seen in ED visit data from 2005-2009 and hospitalization data from 2006-2010.3 Fall Prevention Objective Falls in Young Children The primary location of falls for children is in the home. Falls are the leading cause of non-fatal injuries in children up to four years old, 4 and the most common reason for ED visits in this age group.5 Rapid early development provides various opportunities for children to fall. Babies and young children have bigger heads in comparison to the rest of their bodies, causing the head to hit the ground first. This increases the likelihood of head trauma due to falls. When babies start to roll and kick, they are at increased risk of falling off high surfaces. Similarly, when children learn to crawl and walk, they increase their chances of falling out of windows and off furniture.6 Injury due to falls can lead to permanent Age-Adjusted Motor Vehicle Accidents per 10,000, 2011 -2013 3 ED Visits Hospitalizations Upstate (NYS excl.

Stop the annual increase in the rate of ED visits due to falls among residents ages 65 and over by maintaining the rate at 348.2 per 10,000 residents. Reduce hospitalization rates due to falls among children ages 1 to 4 to 9.1 per 10,000. Reduce ED visits due to falls among children ages 1 to 4 to 429.1 per 10,000 residents. Healthy Capital District Initiative 105 disability, traumatic stress, and decreased ability to perform age-appropriate activities, among other things. The estimated lifetime medical costs for injuries due to falls among ages 1-19 is $5.0 billion.5 In the Capital Region, there is an average of 1,771 ED visits due to falls among children ages 1-4 years annually.7 All counties exceed the Prevention Agenda objective, with the exception of Greene and Saratoga counties. Schenectady County had the highest ED visit rate, followed by Rensselaer and Columbia counties. In the Capital Region, there is an average of 23 hospitalizations due to falls among children ages 1-4 annually. Only Columbia County, with a rate of 11.8/10,000, did not meet the Prevention Agenda objective.8 Falls in Older Adults Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among older adults and the most common cause of nonfatal injuries and hospital admissions for trauma. One out of three older people falls each year in the United States. In New York, every day 223 older adults visit the ER due to a fall. As a result, each day 140 older adults are hospitalized in New York. Approximately 60% of those hospitalized for a fall end up in a nursing home or rehabilitation center.9 Unintentional falls are a serious threat to the lives, independence and well-being of adults ages 65 and older. Each year in the United States, 2.5 million older adults visit the ER due to falls. These falls can cause injuries such as fractures, bruises, and head traumas, which can increase the risk of early death 0100200300400500600 462.1 444.6473.1574.4 583.5 223.8496.1 282.3Rate of ED Visits Due to Falls per 10,000, ages 1 -4, 2011-20137 Rate of Hospitalizations Due to Falls per 10,000, ages 1 -4, 2011 -20138 Prevention Agenda Objective 9.1 Upstate (NYS excl.

Falls are also the most common cause of traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI accounts for almost half of fatal falls among older adults. Hip fractures are the most frequent type of fall-related fractures. Developing a fear of falling is common among people who fall, even among those who are not injured. This fear causes them to limit activities. Such a response leads to reduced mobility, which actually increases their risk of falling.10 Falls have a heavy financial burden as well, with a yearly cost of $1.7 billion for hospitalizations and $145 million for outpatient emergency charges in New York State.9 In the Capital Region, there were 5,300 emergency department visits per year due to falls in the 65+ years population. Schenectady County had the highest rate of ED visits in this population, with a rate of 468.4/10,000, followed by Columbia County. Both counties had rates higher than the Prevention Agenda objective.8 The Capital Region had 2,800 fall-related hospitalizations per year in the older adult population. The rates for hospitalizations in the Capital Region counties are all below the Prevention Agenda objective, with the exception of Rensselaer County, with a rate of 209.4/10,000.8 In the Capital Region, females had over 40% higher ED visit and hospitalization rates due to falls when compared to males, in the 65 + years population.

For fall-related hospitalizations, the comparable rates were 210.3 vs. 147.0.8,11 The risk of being seriously injured from a fall increases with age. In the Capital Region, the elderly fall hospitalization rates were lower when compared to the Upstate New York rates. In the 85+ year population, the Capital Region's fall hospitalization rate of 556.4/10,000 was almost 8 times higher than the rate in the 65-74 years population.12 Workplace Injuries Objective Workplace injuries continue to be a major health problem in the United States. Each year, about 6,000 employees in the United States die due to workplace injuries, while another 50,000 die from illnesses caused by exposure to workplace hazards. In addition, 6 million workers suffer non-fatal workplace injuries at an annual cost to businesses in the United States of more than $125 billion.13 The top causes of work-related injury hospitalizations in New York State are accidents caused by fire, falls, motor vehicle traffic accidents, medical complications and late effects of accidents such as musculoskeletal diseases.14 0.0100.0200.0300.0400.0500.0600.0 65-74 years 75-84 years 85+ years71.0223.1556.4 75.2229.4590.7Fall Hospitalizations per 10,000 by Age, Capital Region and Upstate New York, 2011 -201312 Capital Region Upstate New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 Reduce th e rate of emergency room visits for occupational injuries among adolescents 15 -19 years of age to 33.0 per 10, 000. Healthy Capital District Initiative 108 Occupational fatalities and losses arising from workplace disabilities also cause tremendous personal and economic costs In the Capital Region, 664 work-related hospitalizations occurred in those employed and 16 years and older in age. From 2011-2013, there were 39 fatalities due to work-related injuries in the Capital Region.15 More than 80% of adolescents in the United States have worked by the time they finish high school, and each year 53,000 youth are injured severely enough to seek emergency treatment.4 In the Capital Region, there were 210 youths aged 15-19 years of age, treated in an emergency department due to an occupational injury. Of the Capital Region counties, Columbia County (62.2/10,000) and Saratoga County (53.3) had the highest rates as well as did not meet the Prevention Agenda objective.16 References 1.

Schenectady County had the highest assault ED visit rate in the Region, and, together with Columbia and Albany counties, did not meet the Prevention Agenda objective. Albany County had the highest assault hospitalization rate, with all counties meeting the Prevention Agenda objective. Black non -Hispanics were 9 times more likely to have an assault -related hospitalization than White non -Hispanics. In the Capital Region, the urban counties had higher violent crime rates than Upstate New York. Schenectady County had the highest rates of firear m-related, property and violent crimes, while Saratoga County had the lowest rates. Objectives Although crime is usually considered to be in the domain of law enforcement and the criminal justice system, there is a growing realization that violent crime is a public health concern as well. Not only does crime compromise physical safety, but it can also affect mental health. Crime, vandalism, and graffiti, among other things lead to a decrease in physical activity and an increase in accumulated stress and fear within the community. Residents of high-crime areas who do not practice healthy behaviors are at higher risk for chronic disease and disability. Continuing stress may exacerbate hypertension, contribute to obesity, and increase the prevalence of other chronic conditions such as upper respiratory illness and asthma.1 The health consequences of violent crime on the victim are better-documented. Victims of violence are more likely to injure themselves or commit suicide. High school students who are exposed to violence New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 Reduce rate of homicide deaths to 0.39 per 10,000.

Healthy Capital District Initiative 111 are at higher risk of running away from home, dropping out of school, having a child, and encountering the criminal justice system in later adolescence.2 In 2013, there were 25 homicide deaths in the Capital Region. Schenectady County had the highest rate of homicide mortality in the Capital Region, with 4.4 per 100,000 population, and it was the only county with a rate higher than that of Upstate New York.3 With the exception of Columbia County, all counties failed to meet the homicide Prevention Agenda objective. In 2013, the Capital Region had 3,544 assault-related ED visits and 210 assault-related hospitalizations. For hospitalizations, all counties had lower rates than the Prevention Agenda objective. The highest hospitalization rate was in Albany County, with a rate of 3.0/10,000.

The highest rate was in Schenectady County, with a rate of 74.4. In the Capital Region, males are three times more likely to be hospitalized due to an assault than females.4,5 There are also disparities amongst race/ethnicity in regards to violent crimes. Black non-Hispanics in the Capital Region had 9 times higher the assault hospitalization rate than White non-Hispanics. Hispanics had 2 times the rate compared to White non- Hispanics. Those living in low- income zip codes had 3 to 7 times the assault hospitalization rate than those living in high- income neighborhoods.6 S: Suppressed, data does not meet reporting criteria In the Capital Region, the urban counties of Albany, Rensselaer and Schenectady had violent crime rates higher than Upstate New York. Schenectady County's rate of 40.5/10,000 was the highest in the Region. With the exception of Saratoga and Rensselaer counties, all counties had lower violent crime rates in 2014 compared to 2011.7 Assault -related Hospitalization rate per 10,000 by Race/Ethnicity, New York State ad Capital Region Counties, 2011 -20136 White non - Hispanic Black non - Hispanic Hispanic New York State 1.5 10.9 4.9 Capital Region 1.2 10.9 2.7 Albany County 1.4 12.8 2.5 Rensselaer County 1.9 13.8 3.5 Schenectady County 1.4 8.7 3.1 Saratoga County 0.6 S S Columbia County 0.6 S S Greene County 1.5 S S Violent Crime Rates per 10,000 Population, Comparison between 2011 and 20147 2011 2014 Upstate (NYS excl.

Violent crimes include offenses that involve face- to-face confrontation between the victim and the perpetrator, including homicide, non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Firearm-related crimes are defined as those that include the presence of a firearm during the commission of a murder, forcible rape, robbery, or aggravated assault. Property crimes include burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. For firearm-related crime, property crime and violent crime, Schenectady County consistently has the highest rates of the Capital Region., which are all higher than the rates for Upstate New York. Saratoga County consistently has the lowest rates of the Capital Region.7 References 1.

All Capital Region counties failed to meet the Prevention Agenda objective for use of alternative modes of transportation. No Capital Region county met the \"low access to supermarket\" Prevention Agenda objective . The highest percentage of low -income residents with low access to supermarkets was in Schenectady County. Alternate Modes of Transportation Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 By December 31, 2018, increase the proportion of people who commute using alternate modes of transportation, i.e., public transportation, carpool, bike/walk, and telecommute to 49.2%. Public transit provides many health benefits, but not enough people take advantage of the alternative modes of transportation. While people who use alternative modes of transportation are more likely to stay fit, less than half of Americans achieve this goal. This sedentary lifestyle contributes to many health problems such as less active individuals having a 30-50 percent greater risk of developing high blood pressure.1 Medical expenses for physically- able adults are 32% lower for those who achieve the CDC's goal: as of 2010, medical expenditures for physically active people are $1,019 annually, while they are $1,349 per year for sedentary people. Public transportation also reduces pollution and traffic accidents and makes health care and healthy food more accessible to low income people. High quality public transit provides many varied public health benefits.2 Healthy Capital District Initiative 115 Promoting a healthy and safe environment is a priority of the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH). Their goal is to improve the design and infrastructure of the environment in order to promote healthy lifestyles and sustainability. An important part of this effort is to increase the percentage of commuters who use alternative modes of transportation. Only 22.7% of the population in Upstate New York uses alternative modes of transportation. In the Capital Region, only 18.7% of employed workers used alternative modes of transportation. The highest rate was in Columbia County, the lowest rate was in Greene County, with 15.7%. All Capital Region counties fall below the Prevention Agenda's objective.3 Proximity to Supermarkets Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 By December 31, 2018, improve access to affordable fruits and vegetables among low -income NYS residents by decreasing the percentage who live greater than 1 mile from a supermarket or grocery store in urban areas, or greater than 10 miles from a supermarke t or grocery store in rural areas, to 2.24%. (Year: 2010) A series of studies throughout the United States has found a direct correlation between access to supermarkets and the rate of obesity in the population. Residents with access to supermarkets or stores with healthy affordable food tend to eat more healthily than those who are not in close proximity to these stores. For example, one study found that for every additional supermarket in a census tract, Blacks increased their produce consumption by 32% and Whites increased their produce consumption by 11%. At the same time, those living in food deserts, or people without easy access to supermarkets, eat much fewer fruits and vegetables than their counterparts in close proximity to affordable healthy food. Access to supermarkets is associated with an increase in healthier eating and a decrease in obesity and diet-related diseases. A combination of a lack of supermarkets, a lack of affordable healthy food options in local stores, an abundance of convenience stores that sell highly-processed food, and a lack of transportation produces the opposite effect- an unhealthy and obese nation.4 Percentage of employed civilian workers age 16 and over who use alternative modes of transportation to work or work from home, 2009 -2013 3 Prevention Agenda Objective 49.2 Upstate (NYS excl. NYC) 22.7 Capital Region 18.7 Albany County 20.6 Rensselaer County 19.2 Schenectady County 18.2 Saratoga County 16.0 Columbia County 20.9 Greene County 15.7 Healthy Capital District Initiative 116 In Albany County, Hosler et al demonstrated that urban minority communities have less access to supermarkets than rural communities do in the Capital Region. The lack of supermarkets leads to more barriers to fresh fruits and vegetables In addition, more than 80% of minorities live in an area without a store that sells low fat milk and high fiber bread.6 Of all of the Capital Region counties, Schenectady County had the highest percentage of low income residents with low access to supermarkets, with a rate of 9.61%, this is four times that of the Prevention Agenda objective. In addition, a higher percentage of seniors and children in Schenectady County lack access to supermarkets.7 All counties in the Capital Region have rates higher than the Prevention Agenda objective. Improving access to affordable nutritious food involves the entire community. Tax and zoning laws can make it easier for grocery stores, community gardens, and farmer's markets to operate in target areas. Governments can also regulate the nutritious standards of foods brought with government funding and increase enrollment in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Programs. Public transportation can be planned or rerouted to improve access to supermarkets. Additionally, residents and community leaders can plant community gardens and establish programs that provide heathy food to those in need. References 1.

From 2012 to 2014, the percentage of fluoridated water use has decreased in all counties except Greene County. Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 Increase the percentage of NYS residents served by community water systems that receive optimally fluoridated water to 78.5 % . Fluoride in water has continuously proven to be effective in preventing tooth decay. Drinking water with a fluoridation level of 0.7 to 1.2 ppm can reduce tooth decay by 25% over a person's lifetime. Since tap water is accessible to all parts of the population, this system has been a very cost-effective way of reducing cavities across the public spectrum.1 The percentage of people receiving fluoridated water in the United States steadily rose from 57.4% in the early 2000s to 74.6% in 2012.2 The New York State Department of Health notes that the percentage of New York residents receiving fluoridated water in 2012 was 71.4%, and in 2014 that percentage decreased slightly to 71.1%. Only 38.4% of Capital Region residents had access to fluoridated water. With the exception of Rensselaer County, all Capital Region counties fall below the New York State's Prevention Agenda objective of 78.5%.3 Columbia County provides the least amount of fluoridated water in the Capital Region, with a percentage of 0.0%. Greene County had the second lowest percentage of fluoridated water usage with 6.8%. All counties in the Capital Region have decreased the percentage of fluoridated water usage from 2012 to 2014, with the exception of Greene County, which remained the same.4 0.0%20.0%40.0%60.0%80.0%71.1% 38.4% 13.1%79.5% 66.6% 44.7% 0.0%6.8%Percentage systems with optimally fluoridated water, 20144 Preventio n Agenda Objective (78.5%) Healthy Capital District Initiative 119 References 1.

Healthy Women, Infants, and Children Prenatal Care Highlights Greene County had the lowest percentage of births receiving prenatal care during the first trimester, while Albany County had the highest rate of late (3rd trimester) or no prenatal care in the Capital Region. Across the Capital Region, Black non -Hispanic mothers and Hispanic mothers had lower percentages of births which re ceived early prenatal care (first trimester) and adequate prenatal care. The Capital Region's high risk neighborhoods had 1.2 to 3.0 times higher rates of late or no prenatal care compared to Upstate New York. Prenatal care improves the likelihood of both a healthier mother and a healthier baby. Comprehensive prenatal care not only includes routine ultrasounds and screening for health conditions the mother may develop, but also focuses on improving nutrition and health habits. It can also provide psychological and social support to assist in quitting smoking and drinking alcohol during pregnancy, if needed.1 The Prevention Agenda aims to promote pre-conception health care, emphasizing screening and risk assessment. As many health factors can affect birth outcomes, women of reproductive age should maintain regular preventive care. Inquiry into exposure to environmental toxins, medication use, nutrition, folic acid intake, weight management, genetic conditions and family history should be made as well in order to address them prior to conception. These inquiries and regular monitoring of health, may help to reduce disparities across racial and ethnic groups and also to prevent negative birth outcomes.2 In 2013, there were 2,154 births without early prenatal care, or prenatal care received in the first trimester in the Capital Region. For 2011- 2013, Greene, Columbia, and Albany counties had lower percentages of early prenatal care than Upstate New York, with Greene County having the lowest rate. Approximately 420 Capital Region births had late (3rd trimester) or no prenatal care. Only Saratoga and Schenectady counties had late or no prenatal care rates which were better than the Upstate New York rate, with Albany County having the highest percentage of births with late or no prenatal care .3 Percentage of Births with Prenatal Care 2011 - 20133 Early (1st trimester) Late (3rd trimester) or No Upstate New York 76.0% 4.2% Capital Region County 69.4% 5.8% Healthy Capital District Initiative 121 Adequacy of prenatal care utilization is measured using the Kotelchuck index. This is determined by the month of pregnancy when prenatal care began and the number of prenatal care visits. Women who attend 80% or greater of the recommended number of visits are considered to have received adequate prenatal care.4 In the Capital Region, there were 2,600 births to women who did not receive adequate prenatal care. Columbia, Greene and Albany counties all had lower percentages of women receiving adequate prenatal care than that of Upstate New York, with Columbia County having the lowest percentage of adequate care. Consistently across the Capital Region, Black non-Hispanic mothers and Hispanic mothers have lower rates of early prenatal care and adequate prenatal care compared to White non-Hispanic mothers. For early prenatal care, Greene County had the lowest rate fo r White non-Hispanic mothers (70.4%) and Rensselaer County had the lowest for Black non- Hispanic mothers (59.6%). Columbia County had the lowest rate for Hispanic mothers (55.3%). For adequate prenatal care, the lowest rates for White non-Hispanic mothers were in Columbia and Greene counties (68.7%); in 60.0%62.0%64.0%66.0%68.0%70.0%72.0%74.0%76.0%78.0% 70.8%72.2% 68.9%72.2%76.7%76.0% 66.4%67.2%Percentage of mothers receiving Adequate (Kotelchuck) Prenatal Care, 2011 -2013 3 Percentage of Births with Prenatal C are by Race and Ethnicity, 2011 -20135 White non- Hispanic Black non - Hispanic Hispanic Early Prenatal Care Upstate New York 79.4% 63.3% 67.7% 54.6% Healthy Capital District Initiative 122 Albany County for Black non-Hispanic mothers (52.3%), and in Greene County for Hispanic mothers (54.6).5 High risk neighborhoods in the Capital Region had 1.2 to 3.0 times higher rates of late or no prenatal care compared to Upstate New York.6 References 1.

Black non -Hispanic mothers had the highest percentage of pre -term birth and low birth weight rates in comparison to both White non -Hispanic and Hispanic mothers. Medicaid -insured mothers had lower preterm birth rates than Non -Medicaid mothers did in Albany , Rensselaer and Schenectady counties. Only Saratoga and Greene counties had low birth weight rates lower than Upstate New York; Albany County had the highest rate of low birth weight in the Capital Region. Only Saratoga County had an Infant Mortality rate lower than Upstate New York. Preterm Births Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 - 2018 By December 21, 2018, reduce the rate of preterm birth in New York State to 10.2%. Preterm births are those that occur any time before 37 weeks of gestation. Although the direct causes are still uncertain, there are known risk factors. Smoking, alcohol consumption, stress, late or no prenatal care, certain gum diseases, vaginal infections, high blood pressure, diabetes, being overweight or underweight, and short spacing between pregnancies can all contribute to preterm births. Additionally, having a prior preterm birth significantly increases the risk of a preterm delivery.1 Preterm Birth is the leading cause of infant death in the United States and is a leading cause of long- term neurological problems in children. The final weeks of pregnancy are vital; this is when the baby's organ systems develop to maturity. Infants born preterm may exhibit cerebral palsy, vision and hearing impairment, 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.010.9 10.711.911.4 10.49.010.7 9.1Percentage of Preterm Births (<37 weeks gestation), 2011 -20132 Prevention Agenda Objective (10.2%) Healthy Capital District Initiative 124 and developmental delays. Earlier delivery results in a higher risk for infant death or severe disability; the 2008 United States mortality rate for preterm babies was 7.4 per 1,000 live births, compared to 2.1 for full-term infants.1 There were 1,042 preterm births in the Capital Region in 2013. Overall the Capital Region had a slightly lower prematurity rate than Upstate New York. For 2011-2013, Albany (11.9%) and Rensselaer (11.4%) counties had the highest prematurity rates in the Capital Region. Only Saratoga County and Greene County currently meet the Prevention Agenda objective of 10.2% preterm births. In the Capital Region, Black non- Hispanic mothers had the highest percentages of preterm births in comparison to both White non- Hispanic and Hispanic mothers. Black non-Hispanic mothers were 1.3 to 1.8 times more likely to have preterm births than White non-Hispanic mothers were. Columbia County had the highest percentage of preterm births for Black non-Hispanic mothers (19.6%). Rensselaer County had the highest percentage of preterm births for Hispanic mothers (12.0%) and Greene County (13.8%) had the highest percentage for White non-Hispanic mothers. Columbia County had the highest ratio for Black non-Hispanic to White non-Hispanic preterm births, at 1.8. Hispanic preterm births were lower than White non-Hispanic in Columbia, Greene, Saratoga and Schenectady counties. Unlike Upstate New York, where the prematurity rate for Medicaid mothers was higher (11.8% vs. 10.5%), Capital Region Medicaid mothers had a lower prematurity rate than that of Non-Medicaid mothers (10.8% vs. 10.9%). Mothers covered by Medicaid typically had higher percentages of preterm births than Non-Medicaid mothers. However, three Capital Region counties had higher prematurity rates in the Non-Medicaid mothers: Albany, Rensselaer and Schenectady.

Low birth weight is a major cause of infant mortality and long term disability.5 Risk factors associated with low birth weight are extremes of maternal age, poor nutrition, inadequate prenatal care, cigarette smoking, drug abuse, history of having a low birth weight baby, infections such as cytomegalovirus, low socio-economic background, low educational background and preterm labor.5 The Capital Region had 727 low birth weight births in 2013 and its low birth weight rate was higher than Upstate New York. Of the Capital Region counties, only Saratoga and Columbia counties had rates lower than Upstate New York. Albany County (8.7%) and Schenectady County (8.3%) had the highest low birth weight rates in the Capital Region. Black non-Hispanic infants had approximately two times the percentage of low birth weight births compared to White non- Hispanic infants. Albany County had the highest percentages of low birth weight births for both Black non-Hispanic infants (14.3%) and Hispanic infants (9.5), while Greene County had the highest percentage for White non-Hispanic infants.

Causes of infant mortality in the United States include respiratory distress and other disorders due to low birth weight and preterm birth. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), unintentional injury, birth defects, preterm labor and pregnancy complications are other causes of infant mortality. These causes accounted for 57% of all infant deaths in 2014.6 Infant mortality is reduced when pregnant women make healthy lifestyle choices, such as smoking cessation and avoidance of other harmful substances, maintenance of a nutritious diet and obtaining early prenatal care. These choices are more common among pregnant women in a community that likewise chooses healthy lifestyles. Infant mortality is reduced in communities that have neonatal specialty care for sick newborns and access to comprehensive pediatric care. This specialized medical care commonly occurs in communities that have comprehensive medical care in general. Infant mortality therefore varies among communities in as much as lifestyles, preventive services and medical care varies.6 In 2013, the Capital Region had 60 infant deaths; its infant mortality rate was higher than that of Upstate New York. Of the Capital Region counties, only Saratoga County had an infant mortality rate lower than Upstate New York. Albany County (8.5/1,000) and Schenectady County (7.5) had the highest rates in the Capital Region. Infant mortality rates have declined in Upstate New York in the last decade from 6.1/1,000 in 2004 to 5.5 in 2013. Black non-Hispanic infants have 3 to 8 times the mortality rate of White non-Hispanic infants. Greene County had the highest mortality rate for White non-Hispanic infants, Columbia County had the highest for Black non-Hispanic infants and Schenectady County had the highest for Hispanic infants.

Columbia and Greene counties had the highest rates in the Capital Region. Black non -Hispanic and Hispanic mothers had 1.5 -2.4 times the unintended pregnancies compared to White non -Hispanic mothers. Medicaid mothers had 1.6 -2.1 times the unintended pregnancies compared to non -Medicaid mothers. Objective New Y ork State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 By December 31, 2018, reduce the proportion of NYS births that result from unintended pregnancy to 23.8% Unintended pregnancies are pregnancies that were mistimed or unwanted at the time of conception. Unintended pregnancies are due to inconsistent or incorrect use of contraceptive methods or the lack of their use at all. Women may not be in optimal health for childbearing when they unexpectedly become pregnant, and they are more likely to delay early prenatal care. The rate of infant mortality, maternal mortality, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is much higher in live births resulting from unintended pregnancies than from intended ones. 1 Children born to unintended pregnancies are at higher risk for a host of developmental problems; they have a greater amount of mental health and relationship problems, and score lower on verbal assessments and overall grade point-averages.2 Additionally, unintended pregnancies in women over age 40 pose unique health concerns as they are more susceptible to complications arising during pregnancy, such as gestational diabetes and hypertension. The fetus is also more likely to develop fetal abnormalities, experience fetal distress, and develop chromosomal abnormalities such as Downs' Syndrome.1 Healthy Capital District Initiative 129 There were 2,342 unintended pregnancies among live births in the Capital Region in 2013. All counties in the Capital District had higher percentages of unintended pregnancy among live births than Upstate New York with the exception of Saratoga County. The highest percentage was seen in Columbia County with 34.7%, followed by Greene County with 32.9%. Additionally, there are clear disparities in unintended pregnancies across racial, ethnic and economic backgrounds. In New York State, Black non-Hispanic mothers were 1.5-2.4 times as likely to have a live birth resulting from an unintended pregnancy in comparison to White non-Hispanic mothers. Rensselaer County had the highest percentage of Black non-Hispanic mothers with unintended pregnancies, with 58.0%. Columbia County had the highest percentage of White non- Hispanic mothers with unintended pregnancies with 33.5%. Hispanic mothers were 1.5 to 2.3 times as likely to have a live birth resulting from an unintended pregnancy. Schenectady County had the highest percentage of Hispanic mothers with unintended pregnancies with 51.8%. Medicaid mothers were 1.6 to 2.1 times as like to have a live birth resulting from an unintended pregnancy.

Schenectady County had the highest rates of adolescent pregnancy for White non -Hispanic, Black non -Hispanic and Hispanic adolescents. Albany County had the highest Black non -Hispanic/White non -Hispanic (4.6) and Hispanic/White non -Hispanic (4.6) teen pregnancy ratios of the Capital Region counties. The Capital Region's high risk neighborhoods had 1.5 to 4.2 times higher rates of adolescent pregnancy among females of ages 15 -19 years when compar ed to Upstate New York. Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 By December 31, 2018, reduce the rate of pregnancy among NYS adolescents age 15 -17 years to 25.6 per 1,000. Infants born to adolescent mothers (ages 15-17 years) are at higher risk of low birth weight, neonatal mortality, preterm births, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) compared to infants born to mothers in their twenties and thirties. Teen motherhood also reduces a woman's education and employment opportunities.1 The New York State Prevention Agenda focuses on teen pregnancies rather than births to teen mothers. Four out of five pregnancies among women ages 19 and younger were unintended and 3 in 10 girls become pregnant before the age of 20. Children born to single teen mothers are more likely to have behavioral and emotional problems, poorer physical health, and more likely to use tobacco and alcohol. Adolescent parents are more likely to have economic instability, less educational attainment and more likely to live in poverty.1 Healthy Capital District Initiative 132 There were 275 teen pregnancies to Capital Region teens 15-17 years of age in 2013. The Capital Region rate of 18.0/1,000 was higher than the Upstate New York rate of 14.5. All counties in the Capital Region fall below the Prevention Agenda Objective rate of 25.6, with the exception of Schenectady County with a rate of 29.8/1,000. In addition to Schenectady, Rensselaer, Albany and Columbia counties had teen pregnancy rates higher than the Upstate New York rate.2 The Prevention Agenda objectives aim to reduce the ethnic and racial disparities in adolescent pregnancy. For Black non-Hispanic adolescents, the Prevention Agenda aims to decrease the ratio of Black non-Hispanics compared to White non-Hispanics to 4.9 and the ratio of Hispanics to White non- Hispanics to 4.1. All Capital Region counties met the Prevention Agenda objective for the Black non- Hispanic/White non-Hispanic teen pregnancy ratio with Adolesc ent (15 -17 years) Pregnancy Rate per 1,000 females by Race/Ethnicity, 2011 -2013 and Black non-Hispanic/White non -Hispanic and Hispanic/White non -Hispanic Ratios3 White non- Hispanic Black non - Hispanic Hispanic Black non - Hispanic/White non-Hispanic Ratio Hispanic/White non-Hispanic Ratio Upstate New York 8.6% 34.3 % 25.1 % 4.0% 2.9% Capital Region 11.1 % 43.4 % 29.0 % 2.6% 3.9% Columbia County 11.9 % 26.3 % 22.3 % 2.2% 1.9% Greene County 10.8 % 28.0 % 5.3% 2.6% 0.5% Albany County having the highest ratio at 4.57.

Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 By December 31, 2018, improve birth spacing to 17.0%. Emerging evidence shows that spacing between births affects health outcomes of the mother and the baby. A shortened birth interval, defined as the time between the last birth and the birth of the next child, is associated with an increased risk to the second infant and mother during the second pregnancy. Adverse outcome such as miscarriage, infant death, preterm birth, low birth weight, stillborn, and maternal death are much more common in pregnancies and births occurring within 24 months of a previous pregnancy.1 Other complications may include placenta previa and placental abruption.2 It is possible that short intervals between pregnancies, those less than 24 months, do not allow the mother's body enough time to recover from the first birth. Additionally, the mother's nutrients may be deplete d, leading to insufficient folate and iron during conception and pregnancy. Along with other physiological stresses, this can cause neural tube defects, preterm birth and low birth weight. Adverse health outcomes after a short birth interval may also be related to the population this indicator affects; behavioral and social factors such as inadequate use of medical care, socioeconomic status, and unstable lifestyles may determine health outcomes as well.1 In the Capital Region during 2013, over 2,100 births occurred within 24 months of pregnancy, for a rate of 21.7%. No counties in the Capital Region meet the Prevention Agenda Objective. The highest percentages of live births within 24 months of a previous pregnancy were in Saratoga County (22.8) and Schenectady County (22.5).3 151719212321.121.7 21.5 20.422.522.8 20.6 20.6Percentage of Live Births Within 24 Months of a Previous Pregnancy, 2011 -20133 Prevention Agenda Objective (17.0%) Healthy Capital District Initiative 135 References 1.

Greene County had the lowest percentage of exclusive breastfeeding in the hospital in the Capital Region. There is a significant racial/ethnic disparity in which Black non -Hispanic and Hispanic infants have lower percentages of exclusive breastfeeding when compared to White non -Hispanic infants. Medicaid mothers had lower breastfeeding rates compared to Non -Medicaid mothers. Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 By December 31, 2018, increase the percentage of infants born in New York State who are exclusively breastfed in the hospital to 48.1%. Breastfeeding is the healthiest way to feed a baby. A mother's milk provides vital vitamins and nutrients for the baby, supporting the developing brain and boosting the immune system. Additionally, breastfed babies are less likely to develop diseases and infections, such as diabetes, asthma, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), childhood obesity and allergies. Breast milk protects the infant against a growing list of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and diabetes. Since breast milk is easier to digest than formula, it also causes less vomiting and diarrhea. Automatically adjusting to the baby's changing needs and eliminating the use of bottles, breastfeeding may be more convenient for the mother as well. Breastfeeding strengthens the bond between mother and baby and may help prevent certain cancers, depression, and osteoporosis in the mother.1 The positive economic impact of exclusive breastfeeding is well documented. In addition to families saving $1,200-$1,500 in formula expenses in the first year, healthier babies and mothers put less financial stress on insurance companies and workplaces. If 90% of mothers breastfed exclusively for six months, the United States would save $13 million annually in medical and other expenses, according to a 2010 study published in Pediatrics .2 Healthy Capital District Initiative 137 In the Capital Region, there were over 5,400 infants exclusively breastfed in the hospital in 2013.3 The New York State Department of Health's goal is to increase the number of babies who are exclusively breastfed in the hospital to 48.1%.4 Hospitals that promote exclusive breastfeeding help both mother and baby more easily transition to full time breastfeeding. All counties in the Capital Region met the Prevention Agenda Objective and had higher rates of exclusive breastfeeding than Upstate New York.4 There are clear racial disparities between Black non-Hispanic and White non-Hispanic infants who are exclusively breastfed and between Hispanic and White non-Hispanic infants. For White non-Hispanic infants, the lowest percentage of exclusive breastfeeding in the hospital was in Greene County, with 52.2. For Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic infants, the lowest breastfeeding percentages were in Columbia County, with 32.9 and 30.8 respectively.5 Medicaid mothers were less likely to exclusively breastfeed their infants than non-Medicaid mothers.5 Percentage of Infants Exclusively Breastfed in the Hospital by Race/Ethnicity and Insurance Coverage, 2011 -20135 White non - Hispanic Black non - Hispanic Hispanic Medicaid Non - Medicaid Upstate New York 56.4 % 30.2 % 33.4 % 38.2 % 54.4 % Capital Region 63.8 % 35.7 % 44.0 % 46.1 % 61.3 % 44.4 % 43.8 % 61.0 % Rensselaer County 59.8 % 40.8 % 46.4 % 48.1 % 59.8 % Schenectady County 63.3 % 35.5 % 36.9 % 39.9 % 57.1 % Saratoga County 68.6 % 57.1 % 65.2 % 56.8 % 69.1 % Columbia County 55.8 % 32.9 % 30.8 % 44.9 % 53.5 % Greene County 52.2 % S 44.7 % 52.9 % 50.2 % S: Data do not meet the reporting criteria 020406080 49.358.6 56.7 57.1 55.268.2 52.1 50.7Percentage of Infants in the Hospital, 2011-20133 Prevention Agenda Objective (48.1%) Healthy Capital District Initiative 138 Many mothers initiate breastfeeding, but few babies are still exclusively breastfed a few months later. The American Academy of Pediatrics6 and the World Health Organization7 recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life. In the United States, while 74% of mothers start off exclusively breastfeeding, only 13% are still doing so at the end of six months.2 Breastfeeding information on the state and national level has been collected from the Women, Infant and Children (WIC) Program, which offers nutritious food and education on healthy eating to low income mothers and their children. The number of New York State WIC mothers breastfeeding at 6 months had increased 27% over the last decade, from 30.2% in 2002 to 38.2% in 2011.8 The rate of Capital Region WIC mothers breastfeeding at six months of 19.0%, however, was markedly lower compared to th e statewide rate of 38.2%. In Albany County, 22.6% of WIC mothers were still breastfeeding at six months, compared to 13.6% in Rensselaer County, 17.2% in Schenectady County and 18.0% in Greene County.9 The CDC has identified numerous obstacles to mothers who wish to breastfeed, including healthcare providers who do not provide up- to-date information and instruction and hospital policies and childbirth practices that interfere with breastfeeding initiation. Other obstacles include lack of support and unde rstanding from family and community members, and lack of accommodation at the workplace.2 References 1.

For ages 0 -21 years, all Capital Region counties, except Rensselaer County and Schenectady County , had well child visit rates higher than Upstate New York. The percentage of recommended completed well -child visits decreased as age increased across all Capital Region counties. Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 By December 31, 2018, increase the percentage of children ages 0 -15 months, 3 - 6 years and 12 -21 years who have had he recommended number of well-child visits among NYS Government sponsored managed care health insurance to: 91.3% for 0 -15 months and 3 -6 years; 67.1% for 12 -21 years; and 7 6.9% for 0 -21 years. Well-child visits are important to promote health in children and youth. Well-child visits begin shortly after birth and continue through the teen years. During a well- child visit, the doctor checks the child's growth and development by measuring their height and weight, gives any immunizations that are due, and tests hearing and vision. Lead poisoning screenings and vaccinations are scheduled as well.1 Doctors are able to answer answer's related to the child's health, such as nutrition and physical fitness, and how to manage emergencies and illnesses.2 Well-child visits allow children and parents to assess and address concerns, reinforce healthy behaviors and parenting practices, obtain information and guidance from pediatricians and establish and maintain positive relationships between the family and pediatrician. These visits allow for monitoring of a child's general health and development and health risks and special needs to be identified and addressed before they become serious.3 02040608070.368.572.468.765.572.672.472.5Percentage of Children with Government -Sponsored Insurance Who Have Had the Recommended Number of Well-Child Visits Ages 0 -21 years, 20134 Prevention Agenda Objective (76.9) Healthy Capital District Initiative 141 Percentage of Childr en with Government -Sponsored Insurance Who Have Had the Recommended Number of Well -Child Visits by Age, 20135 0-15 months years 12-21 Prevention 82.5% 65.2% In the Capital Region, 11,000 children did not receive the number of recommended well child visits in government sponsored insurance programs. All Capital Region counties fell below the Prevention Agenda objectives for all age groups, with the exception of Saratoga County (94.7%) and Greene County (92.9%) for children 0-15 months of age. For the 0-15 months of age group, all counties had higher percentages of children receiving well-child visits when compared to Upstate New York (85.4%), with the exception of Albany County, with 83.4%. For the 3-6 years of age group, all counties were had lower percentages of children receiving well-child visits when compared to Upstate New York (81.2%), with the exception of Saratoga and Greene counties, with 84.4% and 82.5% respectively. For the 12-21 years of age group, the counties varied when compared to Upstate New York. Saratoga Columbia and Greene counties have percentages above Upstate New York with 64.2%, 65.7% and 65.2% respectively. In Upstate New York and the Capital Region counties, the percentage of children with government sponsored insurance having had well-child visits decreased with age, the 12-21 age group reporting the lowest percentages of visits.5 Ensuring children attend well-child visits involves improving health care access, utilization of services and the content or quality of care. Racial, ethnic and economic issues affect utilization of well-child services and there are also variations in how the preventive services are offered.3 References 1.

Low-income children in Upstate New York had about 2.5 times the untreated tooth decay than non -low income children. Dental caries, or tooth decay, are the most common chronic disease among children. If left untreated, tooth decay can affect a person's ability to eat, how they look, the way they communicate, and for children, it can disrupt learning and affect performance in school and daily activities. Water fluoridation, access to dental care, and improved oral hygiene have helped to reduce tooth decay in New York State. Dental care accounts for almost 15% of health care expenditures among school-aged children and out- of-pocket expenses are high due to uneven insurance coverage.1 Unfortunately, the childhood oral health data have not been updated since 2009-2011. All Capital Region counties had lower percentages of third-grade children with evidence of untreated tooth decay than Upstate New York (24.0%), with the exception of Saratoga County (39.5%), which had the largest percentage of the Capital Region counties. In Upstate New York, low income children had almost 2.5 time more untreated tooth decay than non-low income children.2 Poor and uninsured residents of the Capital Region are less likely to have adequate access to dental health care. Across the United States, the greatest racial and ethnic disparity among children aged 2- 4 years and aged 6-8 years is in Mexican-American and Black non-Hispanic children.3 In addition, across the U.S., less than 1 of 3 children covered by Medicaid received at least one preventive dental service in a recent year. The CDC recommends community water fluoridation and school-based sealant programs as evidence-based practices health.4 0.010.020.030.040.0 24.0 11.619.7 20.039.5 21.2 13.1Percentage of third -grade children with evidence of untreated tooth decay. 2009 -20112 Healthy Capital District Initiative 144 References 1.

Mental Health and Substance Abuse Poor Mental Health Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 1) Reduce the ageadjusted percentage of adults with poor mental health (14 or more days) in the last month to no more than 10.1%. 2) Reduce the ageadjusted suicide rate to 5.9 per 100,000. Mental health is a core function which has physical, spiritual, and socio-economic impacts. Poor mental health is a cause of adverse physical health outcomes, academic under-achievement, homelessness, unemployment and isolation.1 One in five New Yorkers experiences a diagnosable mental disorder annually; and one in ten experiences an illness serious enough to impair functioning.1 An estimated 97,000 adults in the Capital Region reported 14 or more days with poor mental health in the last month.2,3 Highlights : All counties, with the exception of Columbia County, had a higher percentage of adults reporting 14 or more poor mental health days within the past month than the Prevention Agenda Objective. Schenectady and Columbia counties had mental disease and disorder ED visit rates higher than Upstate NY, whil e Schenectady and Greene counties had higher hospitalization rates than Upstate NY; Schenectady County had 70% higher ED visit rates and 90% higher hospitalizations compared to Upstate NY. Black non -Hispanic residents had 1.8 times the mental disease and disorder ED visit and hospitalization rates compared to White non -Hispanic residents. All counties had higher age -adjusted suicide mortality rates than the Prevention Agenda Objective. Males had higher rates of suicide -related mortality than females; femal es had higher self-inflicted hospitalization and ED visit rates than males. Schenectady County had the highest rates of hospitalizations and ED visits for self - inflicted injuries in those 15+ years of age. Healthy Capital District Initiative 146 In the Capital Region, the percent of poor mental health days is higher than in Upstate New York or the United States.3 No counties, with the exception of Columbia County, met the Prevention Agenda objective for poor mental health days in the past month. Rensselaer County and Greene County had the highest prevalence of 14 or more poor mental health days in the past month. Younger adults are more likely to report poor mental health, as are females and Black non-Hispanics. As income and education levels increase, individuals are less likely to have poor mental health.3 The Capital Region averaged approximately 55,000 mental disease and disorder (any diagnosis) ED visits and 37,000 hospitalizations per year for the 2011-2013 period. For mental disease and disorder as the primary diagnosis, the Capital Region averaged 13,700 ED visits and 4,800 hospitalizations per year. The Region had slightly lower rates compared to Upstate New York. However, Schenectady County had almost twice the mental disease and disorder ED and hospitalization rates compared to Upstate New York. Capital Region male residents had higher mental disease and disorder ED visit rates than female residents (133.7/10,000 vs 114.1), but similar hospitalization rates (53.9 vs 53.6). Black non-Hispanic Capital Region residents have approximately 1.8 times the mental disease and disorder ED visit rates (210.4 vs 116.3) and hospitalization rates (89.4 vs 50.4) compared to White non-Hispanic residents.

The Capital Region provides a broad network of mental hygiene services to meet the needs of residents affected by mental illness or emotional disturbance. These services include public, private and not-for-profit providers and target mental health needs from early childhood identification to the unique challenges of seniors. Provider efforts span three disability areas: mental health, chemical dependency, and mental retardation and developmental disabilities. While many New Yorkers with serious mental disorders are eligible for Medicaid, considerable numbers are part of the \"working poor.\" Many people with mental illness are underinsured or uninsured and have difficulty paying for needed services. This stretches already over-burdened public mental health Mental Disease and Disorder ED Visit and Hospitalization Rates per 10,000, 2011 -2013 ED visit rate Hospitalization Rate Healthy Capital District Initiative 148 There are several patient barriers to accessing mental hygiene services, some of which include income, stigma, consumers not recognizing the value of treatment, health care providers unaware of treatments, and a complicated system of insurance reimbursement regulations with limits and exclusions.5 Mental illness is closely linked to suicide. In general, more than 90 percent of people who die by suicide are suffering from a diagnosable mental illness.6 It is the 8th leading cause of death in the United States, but among the top two leading causes of death of people in their early twenties.5 The impact of suicidal behavior is not fully represented in the number of deaths, as hospitalizations also follow failed suicidal attempts. Death and injuries caused by suicidal behavior affect the economic, social and health resources of the nation. The Capital Region averages over 100 suicide deaths per year. Upstate NY and the Capital Region did not meet the Prevention Agenda Objective for suicide mortality prevalence. The suicide mortality rates for Capital Region counties are above the New York State Prevention Agenda objective.3 Saratoga and Schenectady counties had the highest suicide mortality rates from 2011-2013. 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.0 9.710.89.7 9.812.613.0 10.8 8.4Age-Adjusted Suicide Mortality per 100,000, 2011 -20138 Prevention Agenda Objective 5.9 per 100,000 Healthy Capital District Initiative 149 Women attempt suicide 2- 3 times more often than men, but men are four times more \"successful\" in their attempts than women.7 In the Capital Region, the suicide mortality rate for men was approximatel y five times higher than the rate for female residents in the Capital Region (18.1 per 100,000 versus 3.5). Suicide by White non-Hispanics accounts for 75% of suicides. From 2011-2013, White non-Hispanics had an age-adjusted suicide rate more than twice as high as Black non-Hispanics (11.6 versus 5.2). This trend is similar in other races, with suicides among \"other\" races h ad a suicide mortality rate of 5.7. Counts were too low among Hispanics to present reliable data.8 The Capital Region annually averaged 810 self-inflicted ED visits and 740 self- inflicted injury hospitalizations in ages 15 years and older between 2010 and 2014.

Additionally, reluctance to seek help for substance abuse problems and stigma associated makes it likely this estimate is lower than the true rate. Alcohol Abuse Alcohol is the primary substance used by adults. For youth, alcohol, marijuana and prescription drugs are principal concerns. Binge drinking is a common pattern of excessive alcohol use that brings a person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 percent or above. Binge drinking is associated with many health Objectives New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2017 Reduce the age adjusted percentage of adult binge drinking (5 or more drinks for men on one occasion, and 4 or more drinks for women on one occasion) during the past month to no more than 18.4%. Highlights : Rensselaer, Saratoga, Columbia and Greene counties did not meet the Prevention Agenda Objective for adult binge drinking. Males have 1.6 times the binge drinking rate than female Capital Region residents. Schenectady, Albany and Rensselaer counties had the highest cirrhosis hospitalization rates, while Rensselaer County had the highest cirrhosis mortality rate in the Capital Region. Greene, Columbia and Schenectady counties had higher rates of d rug-related hospitalizations than Upstate NY. Schenectady County had a newborn drug -related discharge rate almost twice as high as the Capital Region rate. Greene and Columbia counties had the highest rates of opiate -poisoning related hospitalizations, whi le Schenectady and Albany counties had the highest rates of opiate - poisoning related ED visits. All Capital Region counties had seen major increases in opiate -poisoning related ED visit rates between 2008 -10 and 2011 -13. Males had higher rates of opiate -poisoning related hospitalizations and ED visits than female residents. Black non -Hispanic residents had higher rates of opiate -poisoning related hospitalizations and ED visits than White non -Hispanic, and Hispanic residents. Healthy Capital District Initiative 152 problems, like unintentional and intentional injuries, alcohol poisoning, sexually transmitted disease, unintended pregnancy, children born with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, cardiovascular disease, neurological damage and more. Binge drinkers are 14 times more likely to report alcohol-impaired driving than non-binge drinkers. Binge drinking is also more prevalent in males than in females.2 In the Capital Region, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Greene, and Columbia counties did not meet the Prevention Agenda Objective of 18.4% of adults reporting binge drinking in the past 30 days.

All Capital Region counties have cirrhosis mortality rates that were higher than the Upstate rate. Rensselaer County has the highest mortality rate in the Capital Region.5 Drug Abuse Drug abuse causes significant changes in brain structure and function, leading to addiction. The negative personal and social consequences of this problem include the deteriorating ability to function in a family, workplace and community. The repercussions of addiction have a significant impact on public safety, health, education and welfare of the individual. There is a clear linkage between addictive disorders and other social issues, including mental illness, inadequate health care, crime, unemployment, child abuse and neglect, homelessness, and educational deficiencies.7 Substance abuse can affect individuals across their lifespan, starting in utero. Maternal use of drugs during pregnancy can result in numerous adverse effects such as low birth rate or developmental disabilities.7 According to The New York State Department of Health, as of 2010, approximately 12% of New Yorkers aged 12 and older experienced a substance abuse disorder.6 Age-Adjusted Cirrhosis Hospitalizations per 10,000, 2011 -20135 New York State, excl.

These counties also had rates higher than the Upstate rate.8 The rates of newborn drug-related hospitalizations in the Capital Region were slightly lower than the Upstate New York rate. Schenectady County had the highest rate of newborn drug-related hospitalizations, almost twice that of the Capital Region rate. Schenectady County was the only county with a newborn drug-related hospitalization rate higher than Upstate New York. Between 2008-2010 and 2011-2013, Rensselaer County experienced a 29% increase in newborn drug-related hospitalizations (80.3 to 113.4), Schenectady County had a 23% increase (161.4 to 222.0), and Columbia County had a increase (70.6 to 91.2).8 051015202530 21.1 18.0 17.519.021.7 12.824.527.7Age-Adjusted Drug Related Hospitalization Rate per 10,000, 2011 -20138 Healthy Capital District Initiative 155 Research shows that alcohol, medications, and other drugs have different effects on seniors than on younger persons. The extent of alcohol and medication misuse among seniors is expected to increase significantly in the future. Opiate Abuse According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2014, opioids accounted for approximately 60% of drug poisoning deaths. Further, heroin-related overdose deaths have tripled nationally from 2011 to 2014. In New York State, first responders and others likely to witness an opioid- related overdose have been trained to reduce the impact of opioid overdoses and prevent death by using naloxone.10 Naloxone is a medication that counters the overdose.11 050100150200250 123.4 116.795.2113.4222.0 64.791.2100.8Newborn Drug -Related Hospitalizations per 10,000 Discharges, 2011 -20138 Healthy Capital District Initiative 156 From 2011 to 2013, the Capital Region averaged 2,200 opiate- related hospitalizations (primary or co- morbidity) annually. Greene County had the highest rates, followed by Columbia and Albany counties. Columbia and Greene counties had higher rates than the Upstate New York rate. Further, between 2008-2010 and 2011-2013 Saratoga County saw a 7% increase in rates of opiate-related drug hospitalizations (14.7 to 15.9), Columbia County had a 10% increase (29.0 to 32.2), and Greene County had a 4% increase (36.2 to 37.9).9 During this same time, the Capital Region averaged 1,400 opiate-related emergency department (ED) visits (primary or co-morbidity).

For 2011-2013, males had a higher rate of opiate poisoning than females (26.0 vs. 20.5), and higher rates of emergency department use due to opiate poisoning (18.1 vs. 13.6). Black non-Hispanics had slightly higher rates of opioid- poisoning related hospitalizations (28.7) and ED visits (18.9) than White non-Hispanics (23.4 and 16.1, respectively). Hispanics had the lowest rates of hospitalizations (15.3) and ED visits (10.2) for opiate poisoning.9 Between 2009 and 2013, the Capital Region averaged 43 deaths annually due to heroin and opioid analgesic overdose.10 There was over a 90% increase in clients receiving Heroin Dependency Treatment at Capital Region Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) certified treatment programs between 2011 and 2014. 01,0002,0003,0004,0005,0006,0007,000 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 20142,5553,0713,512 3,6743,3323,5804,9166,385Clients Receiving Heroin Dependency Treatment at OASAS Certified Chemical Dependency Treatment Programs, Capital Region (6 Counties), 2007 -2014 Healthy Capital District Initiative 158 References 1.

Infectious Disease Vaccine-Preventable Disease Highlights All Capital Region counties had higher percentages of children ages 19 -35 months who had completed the immunization series than Upstate New York, with the exception of Greene County, with no Capital Region counties having met the Prevention Agenda objective. All Capital Region counties fell below the Prevention Agenda Objective, 50% for females aged 13-17 years who were fully immunized for HPV, but were all above the Upstate New York percentage. Columbia and Rensselaer counties had the highest incidence of pertussis of all Capital Region counties and rates higher than Upstate New York. All Capital Region counties exceeded the Prevention Agenda objective of 70% of adults, ages 65 and older receiving flu immunizations, with the exception of Greene County (65.7%). Greene County (60.9%) was the only county with a rate lower than New York State (65.1%) for adu lts, aged 65 and older, who have ever received a pneumonia vaccine. Vaccines are used worldwide to protect against disease by inducing immunity. Immunization is a proven tool for controlling and even eradicating disease. Thanks to vaccines, diseases such as smallpox have been eradicated and many other vaccines have saved millions of lives all over the world. Vaccines contain the same antigens that cause disease; however, the antigens in vaccines are either killed or weakened in order not to cause disease.1 Childhood Immunization Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 Increase the rates of immunization among 19 -35 month olds with the 4:3:1:3:3:1:4 series (4 Tdap, 3 polio, 1 MMR, 3 Hep B, 3 Hib, 1 varicella, 4 PCV13) to 80% or higher. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) sets a standard child immunization schedule of recommended ages to be vaccinated. Receiving vaccines at a young age allows infants and children to become immune early in life, before they are exposed to any of the diseases. Delaying or skipping shots can put children at risk of developing diseases during the delay period.2 In the United States, high immunization rates have greatly helped to reduce the prevalence of vaccine preventable diseases. In New York State, school entry laws require children to receive their vaccinations prior to starting school, which helps to keep immunization levels high. The immunization rates of children younger than school-age, specifically those 19-35 months of age, are still below the Healthy People 2020 goal and the Prevention Agenda objective of 80 percent.3 Healthy Capital District Initiative 160 In 2013, over 4,400 children, ages 19-35 months in the Capital Region were not fully immunized. All Capital Region counties had higher percentages of children ages 19- 35 months who have completed the immunization series than Upstate New York, with the exception of Greene County. No Capital Region counties meet the Prevention Agenda objective of 80%.4 Human Papillomavirus Immunization Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 Increase the three -dose HPV immunization rate among adolescent females, ages 13 -17 years to 50%. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted disease. An estimated 79 million Americans are infected with HPV, with about 14 million people becoming infected each year.5 HPV is easily spread by skin to skin contact with an infected individual. There are more than 40 types of HPV that an affect the genital areas of men and women. Types o f HPV referred to as \"low -risk\" strains cause genital warts, which in many cases are not visible to the naked eyes. Most infected persons do not develop symptoms and are unaware they have HPV, increasing the chances of unintended transmission.5 Certain types of HPV\u2014the \"high- risk\" strains\u2014 cause cancer. Cervical cancer is developed most frequently. Nearly all cases of cervical cancer are caused by HPV. Cervical cancer does not cause symptoms until it is at an advanced stage. It can be treated only when it is diagnosed at an early stage, through screening.6 The recommended ages for administration of vaccines are 11 or 12 years. Males are able to get the vaccine up to the age of 21 years and females up to the age of 26 years. For men with compromised immune systems and who have sex with other men, the vaccine is available up to age 26 years as well. It is important that all three doses of the vaccine be given before sexual activity begins in order for the vaccine to be most effective.7 HPV vaccination prevents against the most common strains of HPV that cause genital warts and cancer. Two vaccines, Gardasil and Cervarix, are available. While both are available to protect females, Gardasil is recommended for males.8 Aged 19-35 months, 20134 Prevention Agenda Objective (80%) Healthy Capital District Initiative 161 In the Capital Region, almost 18,900 females between the ages of 13-17 years were not immunized for HPV in 2013. All Capital Region counties fell below the Prevention Agenda Objective, 50%, but were all above the Upstate New York percentage. Columbia County had the lowest percentage of all Capital Region counties.9 Parental concerns about vaccine safety and lack of provider recommendation keeps HPV immunization coverage low. It is important to educate providers and parents in order to increase vaccine numbers.7 Pertussis Immunization Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is an upper respiratory disease caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis . Symptoms may begin like those of a common cold, but will advance to violent uncontrollable coughing that makes it hard to breathe. If left untreated, pertussis lasts for weeks or months. Symptoms are generally milder in teenagers, adults and those who have been vaccinated. Additionally, although infants may not have coughing fits, pertussis is dangerous for them and can be fatal. Complications of pertussis can include temporary loss of consciousness, pneumonia, and weight loss. Infants may also develop ear infections, apnea, or encephalopathy.10 Pertussis is highly contagious, and is spread through the coughing or sneezing of an infected person. Adults who do not know they have the disease can spread it to their infants with negative consequences. People stop being contagious five days after they have started taking antibiotics; treatment is very important in making the infection less severe and preventing its spread to others.10 It is recommended that adults aged 19 years and older are vaccinated at least once every ten years. The pertussis vaccine for children, DTaP, is a part of the standard set of childhood immunizations. It is administered in five doses between ages 1-7 years of age, and it protects against tetanus and diphtheria as well as pertussis. The adolescent and adult booster, known as Tdap is administered once every ten years beginning at age 11 or 12. Those in close contact with infants, pregnant women, travelers and healthcare professionals should make sure they are up to date with their immunizations.11 Prior immunity also increases immunity to the disease.10 0.010.020.030.040.050.060.0 28.135.636.037.037.735.1 29.730.3Percentage of adolescent females with 3 or more doses of HPV immunization -Aged 13-17 years, 20139 Prevention Agenda Objective (50%) Healthy Capital District Initiative 162 In 2013, there were over 50 cases of pertussis in the Capital Region. Over the past 10 years, pertussis cases in New York State have been on the decline, with spikes in 2006 and 2012. In the Capital Region, Columbia County had the highest incidence of pertussis (18.7/100,000), followed by Rensselaer County with 16.1.12 Flu and Pneumonia Immunizations Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 Increase the percentage of adults, aged 65 years and older, receiving an annual influenza vaccination to 70%. Influenza, or the flu, is among several vaccine-preventable diseases. The flu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Influenza is not the common cold. It is a serious condition. Every year in the United States, 5% to 20% of the population gets the flu. Each year, between 3,000 and 49,000 Americans die from the flu and its complications. Complications from the flu include: pneumonia, ear or sinus infections, dehydration, and worsening of chronic medical conditions (such as congestive heart failure, asthma or diabetes).13 The best way to prevent the flu is by getting a flu vaccination. The CDC recommends an annual flu shot for anyone 6 months and older, especially those at high risk of developing flu-related complications. Influenza viruses undergo frequent antigenic change, causing the vaccine to change frequently as well. It is necessary to receive an annual vaccination against the influenza viruses forecasted to be in circulation each year.14 Pertussis Incidence per 100,000, 2011-201312 Upstate New York 13.6 Capital Region 11.9 Albany County 9.3 Rensselaer County 16.1 Schenectady County 9.2 Saratoga County 12.7 Columbia County 18.7 Greene County 10.3 Healthy Capital District Initiative 163 In the Capital Region almost 33,500 adults aged 65 and older did not receive a flu vaccine from 2013-2014. From 2013-2014, all Capital Region counties exceeded the Prevention Agenda objective of 70% of adults, ages 65 and older receiving flu immunizations, with the exception of Greene County (65.7%). The highest percentage was in Saratoga County (80.2%).15 The flu is often complicated by pneumonia, an inflammation of the lung most often caused by infection. Pneumonia consistently accounts for the overwhelming majority of deaths between the two. Older adults are especially vulnerable. Pneumonia vaccinations are available with the population aged 65 years and older especially targeted for such a vaccination. In the Capital Region, all counties had pneumonia vaccination rates for the 65 years and older population higher than those of New York State (65.1%) with the exception of Greene County (60.9%) In 2013, there were over 1,400 hospitalizations due to pneumonia/flu in the Capital Region. The highest hospitalization rate was in Schenectady County (123.5/10,000). All Capital Region Counties had rates lower than the rate for Upstate New York (122.1/10,000), with the exception of Schenectady County. The lowest rate was in Albany County (91.8).

Black non -Hispanics were 6 -15 times more likely to be newly diagnosed with HIV than White non-Hispanics. Hispanics were 5 -9 times more likely to be newly diagnosed with HIV than White non - Hispanics. Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 By December 31, 2018, reduce the newly diagnosed HIV case rate in New York to no more than 16.1 new diagnoses per 100,000. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the virus that can led to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, AIDS. The virus attacks the cells of the immune system, making it more susceptible to life-threatening infections and diseases and unable to fight them off. HIV progresses to AIDS, the most advanced stage of the disease, in which the body can no longer fight off infections.1 HIV testing is the only way to know for sure if a person is infected with HIV. HIV is transmitted through contact with bodily fluids such as blood, semen, genial fluids, or breast milk. Unprotected sex and sharing needles or syringes with an infected person are the most common ways the virus is transmitted. Flu-like symptoms can occur within 2-4 weeks after exposure and last from a few days to several weeks. Although it may take many years for symptoms of HIV to develop, with many people not experiencing symptoms for 10 years or more, HIV antibodies can be detected in most people within 3 to 12 weeks of infection.1 Post-exposure prophylaxis, or PEP, is a method to prevent HIV infection following a recent unprotected sexual encounter, through sharing needles, sexual assault or occupational exposure. It involves taking antiretroviral medicines after the exposure event, within 72 hours. PEP should only be used in emergencies. Pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is a method to prevent HIV negative individuals in high- risk populations by taking daily antiretroviral medicines to decrease the chances of becoming infected. High-risk populations may include HIV negative individuals who are in an ongoing sexual relationship with an HIV positive partner, or anyone who does not regularly use condoms during sex with partners of unknown HIV status who are at substantial risk of HIV infection.1 There is no cure for HIV currently. Once infected, a person has HIV for life. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a treatment for persons infected with HIV that consists of taking a combination of at least three medications that work to slow the growth of the virus. ART can extend the lives of those infected with HIV and have a better quality of life. As more people are living longer due to ART, the prevalence of HIV has increased.1 Healthy Capital District Initiative 166 In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that there are about 1.2 million people living with HIV as of 2012. The CDC estimates that of that number 1 in 8 did not know they were infected and may have unknowingly transmitted the virus to others. Research had shown that the majority of people who know they are infected take steps to prevent transmission to their partners. It is vital to identify new cases in order to control and accurately measure the HIV prevention efforts and their effectiveness.2 From 2011-2013, there were 199 newly diagnosed HIV cases. Albany County had the highest case rate (10.5/100,000). All Capital Region counties met the Prevention Agenda objective with case rates lower than 16.1/100,000. As of 2014, there were 20,792 people diagnosed with AIDS in the United States. Of that number, approximately 1,914 people were diagnosed in New York State.3 In 2013, the Capital Region had 42 cases of AIDS, with 15 AIDS deaths. Albany County had the highest AIDS case rate and mortality rate in the Capital Region.6,7 The majority of persons living with HIV/AIDS are minorities. From 2011-2013, 51.1% of newly diagnosed HIV cases in New York State were Black non-Hispanics, while 33.4% were Hispanics.4 AIDS Case Rate and Adjusted Mortality Rate per 100,000, 2011 -20136,7 AIDS Case Rate AIDS Mortality Upstate New York 4.5 1.3 Capital Region 4.4 1.4* Albany County 6.6 2.2 Rensselaer County 3.5 1.1* Schenectady County 4.9 2.1* Saratoga 0.4* Greene County 3.2* 2.5* *: Fewer than 10 events in the numerator, therefore the rate is unstable 0.02.04.06.08.010.012.014.016.018.0 7.67.010.5 5.68.6 2.48.0 3.4Newly diagnosed HIV case rate per 100,000, 2011 -20135 Prevention Agenda Objective (16.1) Healthy Capital District Initiative 167 Rates of Black and White vs. Rate of Hispanic and White newly diagnosed HIV cases, 2011 -20138 Black non- Hispanic Rate White non- Hispanic Rate Ratio of Black non- Hispanic/White non-Hispanic Hispanic Rate Ratio of Hispanic/White Non -Hispanic Upstate New York 28.3 3.3 8.6 17.5 5.3 Capital Region 28.0 3.5 8.0 26.0 7.4 Albany County 32.1 5.3 6.1 30.6 5.8 Rensselaer County 24.1* 3.1 7.8 20.0* 6.5 Schenectady County 30.2 3.0 10.1 27.8* 9.3 Saratoga County 24.2* 1.6 15.1 S --- Columbia County S 5.4* --- 52.0* 9.6 Greene County 0.0* 2.3* 0.0 S --- *: Fewer than 10 events in the numerator, therefore the rate is unstable S: Data do not meet reporting criteria ---: Ratio could not be determined due to lack of data The racial disparity amongst Black non-Hispanics and Hispanics when compared to White non-Hispanics was significant. Across the Capital Region, Black non-Hispanics were 6-15 times more likely to be newly diagnosed with HIV than White non-Hispanics. While Hispanics were 5-9 times more likely to be newly diagnosed with HIV than White non-Hispanics. Albany County had the highest rate of newly diagnosed HIV cases for Black non-Hispanics, while Columbia County had the highest rate of newly diagnosed HIV cases for Hispanics. References 1.

The Schenectady County (235.3/100,000) and Albany County (198.9 /100,000 ) female gonorrhea case rates were higher than the Prevention Agenda objective (183.1). The highest rate of Chlamydia was in Schenectady County (1,667.5/100,000), which also was the only Capital Region County not to meet the Prevention Agenda objective (1,458). Across the region , females had higher Gonorrhea rates than their male counterparts did. All Capital Region counties met the Prevention Agenda objective for Syphilis in males, with the exception of Albany County which had the highest rate in the Capital Region (10.8). Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) continue to have a significant impact on the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of New York State. As in prior years, STDs are the leading category of reported communicable diseases in the state. 123,122 New Yorkers had STDs, representing 70% of all communicable diseases reported statewide in 2010.1 Sexually transmitted disease control programs across New York State that conduct public health activities aim to: educate the public on safer sex behaviors; prevent the spread of STDs through counseling and treatment of those infected; and provide health services to partners of persons infected with STDs.2 Gonorrhea Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 By December 31, 2018, reduce the Gonorrhea case rate among persons aged 15-44 in New York to no more than 183.1 cases per 100,000 females and 199.5 cases per 100,000 males. Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported sexually transmitted disease (STD) in New York State.2 Gonorrhea is an infection spread through sexual contact with another person. The bacteria are found in the mucous areas of the body.3 Early detection and appropriate treatment is important. If Gonorrhea is left untreated, it will lead to complications such as infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and ectopic pregnancy. PID is a painful condition that occurs when the infection spreads throughout the reproductive organs and can lead to sterility in women. Men may suffer some swelling of the reproductive organs. Both sexes ma y suffer from arthritis, skin problems, and other organ infections caused by the spread of gonorrhea within the body.3 Healthy Capital District Initiative 170 In 2013, there were over 500 cases of Gonorrhea reported in the Capital Region. For females, all Capital Region counties met the Prevention Agenda objective of rates lower than 183.1/100,000, with the exception of Schenectady (235.3) and Albany (198.9) counties. Only Albany and Schenectady counties exceeded the rates for males and females in comparison to Upstate New York. For males, all Capital Region counties met the Prevention Agenda objective of rates lower than 199.5/100,000. For all counties except Saratoga County, females had higher Gonorrhea rates than their male counterparts.4 Chlamydia Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 By December 31, 2018, reduce the Chlamydia case rate in New York among females aged 15 -44 years to no more than 1,458 cases per 100,000 population. Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacteria Chlamydia trachomatis . Although chlamydia is easily treated, 70% of women and 50% of men do not show symptoms.2 Complications of the infection may lead to inflammation of the cervix in women and inflammation of the urethra in men. 0.050.0100.0150.0200.0250.0 149.3140.0198.9 122.7235.3 19.441.1107.3Gonorrhea Case Rate 20134 0.050.0100.0150.0200.0 129.7111.9175.2 73.0198.0 23.728.731.0Gonorrhea Case Rate per 100,000 males, aged 15 - 44 years, 20134Prevention Agenda Objective (183.1) Prevention Agenda Objective (199.5) Healthy Capital District Initiative 171 Additional complications include pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), which can lead to infertility. In fact, chlamydia is the leading cause of infertility in the United States. Pregnant women can pass chlamydia to their babies during childbirth. This may cause problems in newborns, like chlamydial pneumonia or conjunctivitis. Patients are also more susceptible to HIV infection and other STDs, if exposed.5 In 2013, there were almost 2,400 cases of Chlamydia amongst women, aged 15-44 years in the Capital Region. The highest rate was in Schenectady County (1,667.5/100,000), which also was the only Capital Region County not to meet the Prevention Agenda objective (1,458). Albany, Rensselaer and Schenectady counties were all above the Upstate New York rate (1,220.3). All Capital Region counties had major increases in female Chlamydia rates over the last decade.7 Syphilis Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 By December 31, 2018, reduce the case rate of primary and secondary Syphilis to no more than 10.1 cases per 100,000 for males and 0.4 cases per 100,000 for females. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacteria Treponema pallidum . It progresses through various stages that can last months or years depending on the individual. The primary stage is marked by a painless sore at the location where syphilis entered the body. Left untreated, the sore will go away in a few weeks, and the disease will progress to the secondary stage. This stage is represented by skin rashes or legions in the mucous membranes, and can be accompanied by fever, weight and hair loss, muscle aches, and swollen lymph glands. The rashes may be too light to be noticed, however, and untreated syphilis will pass into the late and latent stages when left untreated. At this point, all 0.0500.01000.01500.02000.0 1220.3 1290.6 1453.3 1433.41667.5 15-44 years, 20136 Prevention Agenda Objective (1,458/100,000) Healthy Capital District Initiative 172 symptoms disappear and the disease can lay latent for months or years. In 15% of untreated people, syphilis can lead to difficulty coordinating muscle movements, paralysis, numbness, dementia, and/or death. Pregnant women with untreated syphilis can pass the disease on to their babies, causing low birth weight, developmental delays, or death. People with genital sores are also at higher risk for transmitting or acquiring HIV. Curing syphilis can be done with an intramuscular injection of penicillin or an appropriate antibiotic, such as tetracyclin.8,9 Although the disease was more prevalent in heterosexual minorities ages 30-39 in the 1990s, the 2000s saw an epidemiologic shift. More recently syphilis is most prevalent in 20-29 years old men who have sex with men (MSM). 72% of all primary and secondary syphilis cases in the United States in 2011 were found in MSM.8 In 2013, there were 32 cases of syphilis in men in the Capital Region. All Capital Region counties met the Prevention Agenda objective for no more than 10.1 cases per 100,000 males, with the exception of Albany County which had the highest rate in the Capital Region (10.8). For women, all Capital Region counties met the Prevention Agenda objective (0.4/100,000) with the exception of Albany County (0.6). There was only one case of syphilis for females in the Capital Region.10 Referenc es 1.

Greene, Columbia and Rensselaer counties respectively had the top three rates of New York State counties; Saratoga County had the 7th highest Lyme disease case rate. Lyme disease is the most commonly reported tick-borne disease in the United States. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks. Typical symptoms include headache, fever, fatigue and erythema migrans, a characteristic bull's eye skin rash . If left untreated, the disease can progress, affecting the nervous system, heart and joints.1 Early detection of the disease is important, as patients in the early stages of the infection usually recover rapidly and completely with treatment. According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), studies have shown that most patients can be cured with a few weeks of antibiotics taken by mouth. Intravenous treatment with antibiotics may be necessary for more advanced patients with neurological or cardiac forms of the illness.1 Patients diagnosed with later stages of disease may have persistent or recurrent symptoms. Known as post-treatment Lyme disease, patients experience fatigue, persistent pain, impaired cognitive function, or unexplained numbness after treatment. Studies have shown that prolonged courses of antibiotics are not helpful among individuals with these symptoms and can cause serious complications.2 The Capital Region had over 1,900 cases of Lyme disease in 2013. Greene, Columbia and Rensselaer counties had the top three Lyme disease rates of all New York State counties.3 References 1.

Objective New York State Prevention Agenda 2013 -2018 Reduce hospital onset CDIs to 5.94/10,000 patient days. C. difficile infection (CDI) occurs when the C. difficile bacterium multiplies in the colon and causes colitis, or inflammation of the colon. This leads to severe diarrhea, fever, nausea, loss of appetite and abdominal pain or tenderness.1 In a small percentage of people, C. difficile lives along with other type s of bacteria normally found in the intestinal tract and does not cause any symptoms or problems.2 Taking antibiotics also makes a person more susceptible to catching the infection from others. CDI is a hospital- associated infection (HAI), since at least 80% of people contract it while they receive other medical care. Although most cases are contracted in the hospital, the number of cases contracted in the community has been increasing. Those most at risk for contracting the infection are the elderly and those on antibiotics in a hospital setting. Although most HAIs are declining, CDI rates have been climbing since 2000.1 CDI is highly contagious and resistant to usual forms of infection control. C. difficile is found in the feces of infected patients, and any contaminated surfaces will become breeding grounds for the bacteria. Transmission can occur through the hands of healthcare personnel who have touched contaminated surfaces, or through the use of contaminated medical instruments. Alcohol does not kill C. difficile, so the rooms of infected patients need to be cleaned with bleach, and staff should wash their hands with soap and water.1 At least 92% of New York hospitals place patients with diarrhea on contact precautions even before a diagnosis comes in and use dedicated medical equipment for these patients. 94% of New York hospitals had an education, orientation, or training program for staff on reducing transmission of CDI.2 CDI is treated by discontinuing prior antibiotic use and through the prescription of a stronger antibiotic that targets the CDI. In 2013, New York State hospitals reported 20,273 cases of CDI. Although some cases of CDI are transmitted through the community, most cases are hospital-associated. Albany Medical Center, St. Peter's Hospit al, Ellis Hospital and Columbia Memorial Hospital all had rates above the Prevention Agenda objective (5.94/10,000 patient days). All other Capital Region hospitals had rates which met the Prevention Agenda objective. Different testing methods can cause a variation in rates among hospitals. Comparisons between facilities are hard to make, as rates are only risk adjusted and not age- or facility- adjusted.2 Healthy Capital District Initiative 176 Prevention and control practices can be used to lower the incidence of C. difficile infections. Education programs for healthcare workers, environmental personnel, patients and families can be used to teach proper methods of reducing the spread. Doctors can work to restrict the pervasive usage of antibiotics and prescribe them only when necessary. Many facilities have a specific staff member who reviews antibiotic use. Proper contact precautions, hand hygiene and environmental disinfection have also proven successful in halting the spread of disease.2 References 1.

Healthy Capital District Initiative 300 2016 Capital Region Community Health Survey Summary Introduction The Healthy Capital District Initiative (HCDI) conducted its second Community Health Survey of residents in the Capital District during March to April 2016. The aim of the survey was to learn more about behavioral health/lifestyle practices, health care utilization and needs, challenges to practicing healthy behaviors and accessing care and acceptability of community health programs. The Siena College Research Institute was contracted to collect the data for this Community Health Survey. A random sampling design was applied to recruit a representative sample of 2,408 participants. Approximately 400 residents in each of the 6 counties (Albany, Columbia, Greene, Rensselaer, Saratoga and Schenectady) participated in the survey. The sample from each county was statistically weighted to the proportionate share of the population of the entire region, making the overall margin of error including the design effects of weighting +/-2.7 percentage points at the 95% confidence level. The data collection instrument was developed by HCDI in collaboration with the Prevention Agenda Steering Committee and Siena College. The questions were asked in reference to a 12 month period to improve consistency in response. The questionnaire was pilot tested before adopted for use. Trained interviewers at Siena College administered the questionnaires to ensure fidelity of the data. Participants who were 18 years and eligible to take part in the study were interv iewed on their cellphones or landlines. The questionnaire took approximately 15 minutes to complete and a response rate of 13.7% was obtained. Up to seven attempts were made before participants were classified as non-response. Forty-four percent of the respondents consented to be contacted to participate in future surveys or other research studies. The participants were not compensated to take part in the survey.
