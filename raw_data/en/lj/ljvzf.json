This handbook is a guide that is meant to describe beliefs and practices generally found within a particular cultural or religious group. As often as possible, we have verified the content with people who self -identify with that particular group. That process is ongoin g. We have consulted , printed , and referred to online sources considered the most authoritative in this content area. However, we understand , as should the reader , that not everyone who identifies with a particular cultural or religious group will adhere t o the beliefs or values as presented. 2. This handbook is not complete - and it will likely never be. Thus, the reader will see that much information is still missing because we have not found sources on a given topic that we consider authoritative. We periodically post new versions of the handbook as we accumulate new information. As this handbook is a work in progress, we welcome feedback and contributions via email to the Rev.

The Joint Commission (JC) holds hospitals accountable for addressing and maintaining patient rights. Founded in 1 951, the Joint Commission looks out to improve the healthcare providence of the gene ral public. The Joint Commission is the oldest standard -setting and accrediting body in health care. The commission is headed and governed by a 32 member board. These rights include the accommodation of cultural, religious, spiritual, and personal values a s well as to religious and other spiritual practices. Health care professionals are entrusted to care for patients as whole persons - body, mind and spirit. The health care approach is interdisciplinary and encompassing. It is important then, for that app roach to be culturally and spiritually sensitive. In addition, health care professionals need to be empowered with the capacity, skills, and knowledge to respond to the unique needs of each patient and their loved ones. Applicants seeking who seek accreditatio n by the commission need to have high expertise in administrative affairs, clinical practice, cultural competence, language access, p astoral access, patient advocacy, patient safety, patient -provider communication, health care policy, research and risk management. The Joint Commission's Roadmap for Hospitals: Advancing Effective Communication, Cultural Competence, and Patient - and Family -Centered Care promotes communication and cultural competence. This monograph provides methods for hospitals to improve their efforts to ensure that all patients are receiving the same high quality healthcare. The Roadmap for Hospitals does not de tail the process for how to become fully competent and patient/family centered. However, the Joint Commission urges h ospitals to adopt a combination of methods as a means of setting a foundation for creating the process, policies and programs that best suit their organization. The Roadmap for Hospitals address es topic s like language access, cultural competency, health literacy and communication barriers and mobility needs. The Roadmap for Hospitals is structured so that the beginning chapter s mirror the continuum of care including Chapter 1: Admission, Chapter 2: Assessment, Chapter 3: Treatment, Chapter 4: End of Life Care, and Chapte r 5: Discharge and Transfer. Chapter 6 addresses Organization Readiness. The Roadmap for Hospitals can be utilized in various ways to improve the quality and level of patient and family centered care. It can be used to improve performance, train staff, help inform policy and evaluate compliance with relevant laws, regulations and standards. The Roadmap for Hospitals: Advancing Effective Communication, Cultural Competence, and Patient - and Family -Centered Care can be found on the Joint Commission 's website at : http://www.jointcommission.org/assets/1/6/ARoadmapforHospitalsfinalversion727.pdf \u00a9 HealthCare Chaplaincy Network 2014 Page 7 Religions Western Religions Comparison of Jewish, Christian and Muslim Traditions *The three traditions are historically linked, yet with key differences in belief. All believe in: One God who is almighty, just and merciful. Heaven and hell after death . God's call to Abraham in the land of U r. Similar codes of ethics . Hebrew Scriptures (Christian Old Testament) . *Primary belief differences concern Jesus Christ. Christians believe: Jesus Christ is the messiah (savior) of humanity. Jesus Christ is the holy son of God . The Chris tian Scripture (New Testament) i s a continuation of the Hebrew Scripture (Old Testament) . Jews believe: Jesus Christ is not the messiah . The Hebrew Scri pture (Christian Old Testament) . Muslims believe: Jesus (called Isa) was a prophet . Isa did receive words from God (called Allah ), but the Bible has corrupted those words. Now the Qur'an is the only reliable book of Allah's words and Isa's teachings. Isa didn't die, he ascended to Allah . \u00a9 HealthCare Chaplaincy Network 2014 Page 8 Christianity All believe in: One God who is almighty, just, and merciful. Jesus Christ who is the messiah and son of God . Jesus' death and resurrection . Eternal life through faith in Jesus . Following of the Bible, which includes the Old Testament and the New Testament . Following of Christ's teachings in daily life. (In ways such as following the 10 Commandments, the New Covenant, the Bible) . Christian Science * Also known as Church of Christ, Scientist Beliefs Includes study of Metaphysics, which suggests the presence of spiritual powers that operate on the mind an d body. Faith does not rest on blind belief; rather, understanding perfection of God's spiritual creation in the present . All religions have value . Daily Practices Prayer and sacraments . Dying and Death Euthanasia contrary to teachings . Most do not donate body or organs . Disposal of body and burial is a family decision .

Rituals or ceremonies No outward ceremonies or observances . \u00a9 HealthCare Chaplaincy Network 2014 Page 9 Spiritual instruments, structure and symbols Primary text is Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures . No set apart leadership, but full -time healing ministers (practitioners) structure and practice spiritual healing, which is uniquely different from medical or psychological techniques . Eastern Orthodox Beliefs The community recites the Nicene Creed at every Divine Liturgy, which summarizes the beliefs of the Church. The Orthodox view the Trinity as three persons, one in essence and undivided. Christ is understood to be the Son of God, both fully divine and fully human, and the Holy Spirit enables humanity to apprehend God's presence in the world. In the Bible, God has revealed Himself as living and present in his people. It is considered the Word of God though not considered inerrant or literal. Veneration of Mary referred to as the Theotokos (God -bearer ) in that she carried the New Covenant in the person of Christ. A person's communion with God is expressed in love. Where there is no love, Go d is absent and there is no spiritual life. All are already saved (Christ's death and resurrection), are still being saved (through participation in the church), and will be saved in the future (second coming of Christ). Daily Practices Divine Liturgy att endance on Sundays and/or holy days; some communities hold Matins and Vespers services daily. Prayers at home with icons and/or incense . Dying and Death Holy Unction (anointing with oil) is administered to the sick by Orthodox clergy. It is administered to all Orthodo x on the Wednesday of Holy Week (the week between Palm Sunday and Easter). The church offers special prayer s for the dead on the third, ninth, fortieth day and one year anniversary of the death. The traditional saying after a person has passe d away is Memory Eternal . Belief that the departed soul can be affected by intercessory prayers; redemption and reconciliation with God is possible after death. Facilitating Practices Christians pray in the presence of icons, making the sign of the cross. Icons are not worshipped but instead are venerated and honored as windows into divine reality and as an aid to prayer. \u00a9 HealthCare Chaplaincy Network 2014 Page 10 Food Many Orthodox fast from meat, dairy and oil on Wednesdays and Fridays. During Great Lent and Christmas Lent (Advent), a 40 -day period of fasting from meat, dairy and oil is observed. The fast is broken with a joyous community feast after the Divine Liturgy. Fasting is flexible for those with health concerns or those who are pregnant. Health God is understood to be the Divine Physician and the healer of our souls and bodies, which is facilitated through prayer and participation in the life of the Church. Traditional medical interventions are generally accepted. Holy Days and Festivals The Church observes a structured liturgi cal cycle of twelve feast days; Pascha (Easter is considered the feast of feasts ). Every Sunday is dedicated to celebrating the Resurrection and the Triune God. Various saints' days are celebrated throughout the year. Pregnancy and Birth Babies are baptized by immersion as early as 2 months of age; after baptism, they receive Holy Communion and are full members of the body of the Church.
