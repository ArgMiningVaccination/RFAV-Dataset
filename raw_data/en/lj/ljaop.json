Analgesics act either directly on the centers of pain in the brain or by blocking the transmission of pain to the brain. Synonym: analgesic. [anticoagulant ] Medication that prevents blood from coagulating and therefore prevents clots from forming in the blood vessels. Anticoagulants are used to treat or prevent phlebitis, pulmonary embolism, certain infarcts. They also prevent the formation of clots in the heart during rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation or in the case of an artificial heart valve. There are two main types of anticoagulants: - oral anticoagulants, which block the action of vitamin K (antivitamin K, or AVK) and whose effectiveness is controlled by a blood test: INR (formerly TP); - injectable anticoagulants derived from heparin, the efficacy of which can be controlled by the blood assay of anti-Xa activity, Howell's Time (TH) or Cephalin Kaolin Time (TCK) depending on the products used. A regular dosage of blood platelets is necessary throughout the life of a heparin derivative. [antipyretic ] Medication used to lower the body temperature during bouts of fever. [osteoarthritis ] Wear of cartilage, responsible for joint pain and limitation of movement. [diarrhea ] The strict medical sense of diarrhea is \"emission of stools too frequent and too abundant\". In fact, common sense equates diarrhea with the notion of fluid and frequent stools. Normally, stools are pasty, but the emission of liquid or barely formed stools, without pain or particular associated disorder, is not pathological. Diarrhea can occur when liquid stool emissions are repeated throughout the day and the needs are overwhelming or painful. Many medicines can accelerate intestinal transit and make the stools more liquid, without this undesirable effect being of real concern. Antibiotics can alter the digestive flora, essential for digestion, and cause more or less troublesome but benign diarrhea. The effect appears immediately or after a few days of treatment. A severe and exceptional form of diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, can be observed after antibiotic treatment; this condition results in the emission of mucus and false membranes (resembling skin flaps) associated with abdominal pain; constipation may replace the initial diarrhea. Pseudomembranous colitis can occur several days after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment and requires urgent medical advice. [inflammation ] Natural reaction of the organism against an element recognized as foreign. It manifests itself locally by redness, heat, pain or swelling. [renal failure ] Inability of the kidneys to eliminate waste or medicinal substances. Advanced renal insufficiency does not necessarily result in a decrease in the amount of urine excreted. Only a blood test and creatinine dosage may reveal this disease. [phenylketonuria ] An inherited disease that is characterized by the absence of an enzyme and that leads to the accumulation in the blood of a toxic product. Screening is systematic at birth. Treatment is based on a specific diet during early childhood. [dosage ] Quantity and distribution of the dose of a drug according to the age, weight and general condition of the patient. [allergic reaction ] Reaction due to hypersensitivity of the organism to a drug. Allergic reactions can take a wide variety of aspects: urticaria, angioedema, eczema, eruption of pimples resembling measles, etc. Anaphylactic shock is a generalized allergic reaction that causes discomfort due to a sudden drop in blood pressure. [salt ] Chemical substance of which the best known is sodium chloride, or table salt. The diet salt does not contain sodium; this is generally replaced by potassium. [sodium ] An inorganic substance which can form salts, especially with chlorine (sodium chloride, or table salt). [sugar ] General term for various substances of which the most widely used is sucrose. Other sugars can be contained in drugs: glucose, fructose, lactose, etc. Glucose is the sugar used by the body; it is the only one to circulate in considerable quantity in the blood. Sweeteners (false sugar) are allowed in diabetics or people on a diet, and are very low in calories. [overdose ] Excessive intake of a drug may result in an increase in the intensity of adverse effects or even in the development of specific adverse effects. This overdose may result from accidental or voluntary poisoning for suicide, so consult your local Poison Control Center (listed in the appendix to the book). However, in most cases, overdose is the result of an error in the understanding of the prescription, or the search for an increase in efficacy by exceeding the recommended dosage. Finally, untimely self-medication may lead to excessive absorption of the same substance contained in different drugs. Some drugs are particularly prone to this risk because they are (wrongly) considered to be harmless: vitamins A and D, aspirin, etc. Stopping or decreasing drug intake helps to remove the disorders associated with an overdose.
