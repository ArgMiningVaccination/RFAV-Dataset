Quick overview - In traditional Chinese medicine the kidneys do more than regulate the body's fluids. - They also keep the opposing forces of yin and yang in balance and store the life force energy known as jing, which declines as we get older. - There are herbs, diet and lifestyle tips you can incorporate into your daily routine to support your kidney health. In Chinese medicine, the kidney is also traditionally understood to govern other body fluids (including tears, saliva, perspiration and the fluids that lubricate the joints). It's also closely associated with healthy transition through each of life's stages, from early adulthood right through the ageing process. Yin and yang: the keys to balance From the perspective of TCM, the complementary but opposing forces of yin and yang exist everywhere in nature, including in the human body, where the Kidney organ-meridian works to keep them in balance. Yin is nourishing, moistening, still and calm, and is associated with feminine qualities as well as coolness, slowness, contraction and downward movement. Yang is active, energetic and fiery in nature, and is associated with masculine qualities, heat, dryness, speed, expansiveness and upward movement. Maintaining yin and yang in a state of balance and harmony is traditionally considered optimal in TCM. If kidney yang is deficient, and yin is exerting too much influence, resulting symptoms may be associated with a lack of 'fire' and/or a slowing down of activity - for example fatigue, urinary frequency or reduced libido. On the other hand, if kidney yin is deficient, yang can become overactive, which may manifest as heat or restlessness. Deficiency of kidney yin may also be associated with an imbalance of body fluids including urine output, decreased vitality and mild dizziness. Jing: your back-up power source The kidney organ-meridian system is also the storehouse for [jing, a form of life force energy](/fusionhealth-healthhub-blog-what-jing.html) that's with us in finite quantities from the time we're conceived, but naturally declines as we get older. How to strengthen kidney qi In times of need, your stored bank of jing acts as a form of back-up energy for your primary power source, the life force energy called qi, which you extract from the air you breathe and the food and drink you consume. In that sense, you might like to think of jing as being similar to the back-up battery that automatically jumps into action if the electricity supply to your computer cuts out. Using your jing as your back-up power source means that the rate of its natural decline speeds up, especially if you've been working long hours, leading a stressful lifestyle or neglecting your diet. Consequently, from mid-life onwards, many people start to experience deficient jing. [Ways you can preserve your jing](/fusionhealth-healthhub-blog-what-jing.html) include eating a nutritious, balanced diet, exercising regularly (tai chi and qigong are especially helpful), and maintaining a healthy balance between work and rest.
