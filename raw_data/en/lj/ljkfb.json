The 2019-2020 term brought together more than 800 experts from academia, government, business and civil society to challenge conventional thinking and develop new insight and perspectives on the key global systems, as well as the impact and governance of emerging technologies through: -Scoping and monitoring trends and developments -Contextualizing global shifts within the main regional and/or national frameworks -Deepening understanding of the drivers and enablers of the Fourth Industrial Revolution and its impact on global systems -Informing the World Economic Forum's strategic initiatives by providing analysis and feedback on the direction of existing projects as well as new areas of focus -Highlighting the implications of these dynamics for decision-makers This report provides an overview of the 38 Global Future Councils in the 2019-2020 term, including council mandates and objectives, achievements and the list of members.The world's foremost interdisciplinary knowledge network dedicated to innovative thinking and shaping a more resilient, inclusive and sustainable future Network of Global Future Councils 2019-2020 September 2020 Watch our film about the Global Future Councils Click here Network of Global Future Councils 2019-2020 4Overview of council outputs in the 2019-2020 term 170+ Over 170 Forum Agenda blogsOver 40 white papers, reports and community papers40+ 40+ Over 40 virtual meetings and sessionsContribution to the Forum's Transformation MapsParticipation in World Economic Forum meetings and workshopsNetwork of Global Future Councils 2019-20205Co-Chairs Members Fellows73 748 38Membership categories Male Female55% 45%Gender distribution Organizations 18% Social Entrepreneurs 4%Academia and Think-Tanks 28% Arts, Culture and Sports 1%Business 40% Civil Society and North Asia 1%Middle East and North Africa 6% Japan 4%North America 30% Greater China 6% Latin America 5%Region distribution by nationalityAt the beginning of the term, council members met at the Annual Meeting of the Global Future Councils 2019 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, on 3-4 November, to provide forward-looking thought leadership and promote innovative thinking. Meeting objectives: -Enable each council to define its vision, objectives and workstreams, and build a plan to deliver on the council's objectives -Foster debate and the exchange of views across the entire council network -Brainstorm ideas and pathways to solutions on cross-cutting issues -Cross-pollinate thinking and ensure a truly systemic approach to develop solutions and recommendations for global decision-makers The meeting opened with a panel discussion about transitioning from thought leadership to systems leadership. Ahead of the meeting, the Forum published several pieces on Agenda, which allowed members to imagine what our collective future might look like if we get things right. These included: -It's not the circular economy, it's just the economy -Everyday devices that help us to keep tabs on our mental health -CO-topia: reusable cups, pedestrian paradise and plant-based mealsCross-council sessions explored threads running throughout and between councils, including accelerating technology solutions for sustainable development; creating shared value from data; developing an agenda for social mobility; implementing stakeholder capitalism; mapping the gaps in technology governance; mobilizing action on air pollution; and navigating a multipolar, multiconceptual world. For example, one of the two cross-council sessions on accelerating technological solutions for sustainable development raised the transformative opportunity for virtual reality to educate policy-makers on the need for climate action. More than 100 senior government leaders from the United Arab Emirates participated in special strategic sessions that explored systems leadership in geopolitics and trade, engaging directly with experts from the Network of Global Future Councils on policy recommendations. The closing plenary on Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World shared a number of wishes for the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2020. The panellists asked participants of the Annual Meeting to focus on the \"how\" of implementation for the sustainable development goals; developing common metrics for benchmarking progress; sharing \"test practices\" rather than best practices; and on building solid, sustainable relationships that can serve the public good. Lastly, the World Economic Forum released the white paper Global Technology Governance: A Multistakeholder Approach, which explains cross- cutting issues and barriers to collective action on technology governance, and provides guidance on steps that government, industry and civil society can take to contribute to a multistakeholder approach.Annual Meeting of the Global Future Councils 2019 Council members met to provide forward-looking thought leadership and promote innovative thinking+600 Network of Global Future Councils 2019-2020 6Network of Global Future Councils 2019-20207Network of Global Future Councils 2019-20208Global Future Council on Advanced Manufacturing and Production1 Network of Global Future Councils 2019-2020 9 -Technological advances and innovation in manufacturing are transforming factories and enabling a new generation of partnerships and business models to drive sustainable economic growth.

A set of agile governance tools (for example, regulatory sandbox, crowdlaw, industry standards, outcome-based regulation) are quickly becoming elements in the toolbox of policy-makers to maximize the benefits of science and technology for society. The Global Future Council on Agile Governance in the 2018- 2019 term focused on providing guidance on the best agile governance tools for addressing different policy questions. In the 2019-2020 term, the council built on this work and created a platform for communities of practitioners of these agile governance tools to share best practice, expand the use of these tools and push their boundaries. -Kicked off an initiative to assess the agility of the regulatory system for innovation in select departments in the UK and Japan governments; the methodology for assessing the agility of a regulatory system and a Playbook of Agile Governance Tools for senior policy-makers will be made available in November 2020 -In collaboration with Apolitical, the council is honouring 50 people leading 21st-century governance in its Agile 50 list, which will be published in November 2020 -Facilitated a webinar on Agile Governance for the Fourth Industrial Revolution for policy- makers in collaboration with the Thunderbird School of Management -Published two World Economic Forum Agenda blogs: -These 10 tips for tech regulators will drive innovation by Lisa Witter, Co-Founder and Executive Chairperson, Apolitical, Germany; and Jaee Samant, Director- General, Market Frameworks, Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy of the United Kingdom -COVID-19: The 4 building blocks of the Great Reset by Hilary Sutcliffe, Director of SocietyInside, United KingdomCouncil outputs 2.2Mandate and objectives 2.1 Agile governance tools are becoming elements in the toolbox of policy-makers to maximize the benefits of science and technology for society.

Consumers in developed economies are increasingly active in their healthcare choices and solicited for genetically based products. Consumers in emerging economies may be sceptical of new biotechnology-based diagnostics and treatments, given the history of medical research and economically disadvantaged populations. In this context, the Global Future Council on Biotechnology aimed to identify policy opportunities capable of accelerating new biotechnological discovery and application while guiding the dialogue with consumers about their implications. -Published five World Economic Forum Agenda blogs: -We need to talk about big data and genomics.

The council has been seeking to assist cities to become low carbon by 2050 by identifying best practice solutions that cities can employ to create low-carbon cities, but also with added co-benefits in terms of health and inclusion. Since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, the council expanded their work to having weekly meetings to enable cities to share the current situation in their city, the response, the progress, the struggles, where help is sought, and their strategy to ease lockdown and post COVID-19. It also enabled businesses, international organizations and civil society to advise of the initiatives they have developed to assist cities. In addition, it has now enabled cities, business and civil society to work together to rethink the future of cities and the global trends resulting from COVID-19 that will require cities to transform and adapt. They also opened these sessions up to guest city presenters and guest observers. -Council Co-Chair Carlo Ratti, Director, SENSEable City Laboratory, MIT - Department of Urban Studies and Planning, USA, contributed and facilitated the session Strategic Intelligence Briefing: Low-Carbon Cities at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2020: More than 100 cities have committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions from urban buildings, materials, transport and waste by around 90% by 2050; this session explored how innovation and technology can help cities achieve their low-carbon targets -Hosted two webinars: -The Helsinki Energy Challenge that featured Jan Vapaavuori, Mayor of Helsinki, Finland, discussing the global \u20ac1 million challenge competition to decarbonise the heating of Helsinki using as little biomass as possible -The Connected Units for Respiratory Ailments (CURA) that featured Carlo Ratti, Director, SENSEable City Laboratory, MIT - Department of Urban Studies and Planning, USA, discussed CURA, an open source design for emergency COVID-19 hospitals; it uses repurposed shipping containers to create plug-in intensive-care units (ICU) with biocontainment through negative pressure; each pod acts as an autonomous unit that can be shipped globally, capable of instant installation in multiple configurations -Since March 2020 the council hosted 15 weekly calls to enable cities to share their experiences in relation to COVID-19 and understand the supports being offered by international organizations, business, academia and civil society; in addition, the council worked together to rethink cities post-COVID-19.

A major obstacle to society's continued path to development are the ever-increasing cyberattacks carried out by malicious actors taking advantage of a borderless playing field, and the challenges to digital trust that this represents. Enhancing collaboration between public- and private-sector partners, civil society and academia is of paramount importance to counterbalance the trend. The Global Future Council on Cybersecurity drew a comprehensive picture of the cybersecurity and digital trust landscape, developed cybersecurity and resilience as a key element of executive decision-making, and provided expert input to the World Economic Forum's Platform for Shaping the Future of Cybersecurity and Digital Trust.

In particular, traditional bilateral and multilateral government- to-government sources of development finance alone cannot meet the financing needs of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The financing gap is most acute for small and vulnerable states, which have the most difficulty attracting commercial investment and remain most reliant on government-financed development assistance. This is illustrated by the fact that between 2012 and 2015, only 7% of the $81 billion in private finance mobilized for development went to least developed countries (LDCs). The opportunity to mobilize private finance to support the SDGs in developing countries exists, but investors and conventional development partners lack the tools and coordination to cooperate effectively at scale. A pivot from \"funding\" to \"financing\" to mobilize capital for the SDGs is necessary. This entails a transition from heavily relying on ODA and public funds when investing in sustainable development to systematically consider all the sources of capital that could be deployed - a mix of public, private, domestic and international finance to strategically enable a high-impact pipeline of projects that advance the SDGs at a national level. However, in a global context of trade tensions, skyrocketing levels of debt and declining economic growth forecasts, collective action across the private and public sectors will be needed to unlock the capital necessary to achieve the 2030 Agenda. The Global Future Council on Development Finance explored a strategy to help close the SDG funding gap based on three pillars: -Supply-side measures to create more effective financing platforms to attract private investors -Demand-side initiatives such as Country Financing Roadmaps to create the conditions for capital to flow -The connection between supply and demand by working with intermediaries to address market failures Council outputs 9.2Mandate and objectives 9.1 -Held a Strategic Intelligence Webinar on Development Finance During COVID-19.

An estimated 60-70% of new value created in the economy over the next decade will be based on digitally enabled platforms. About 50% of the world's population does not participate in the digital economy at all - and growth in internet adoption is slowing. Companies need to reimagine how to create, distribute and capture value in this new environment. Closing digital divides is not only conducive to economic growth for all sectors, but also critical for social and political stability in the decade ahead. The Forum's platform on Digital Economy and New Value Creation works with over 1,000 executives, experts, policy-makers, civil society leaders and academics to create new frameworks for disrupting traditional business, investment and innovation models, and to create sustainable value for an inclusive economy. Themes include digital stewardship, shaping new value pools and emergent industries, rethinking business models and business fundamentals, building new ecosystems, creating sustainable value from data, investing for digital inclusion and assessing the disruptive impact of new technologies such as 5G and AI. The Global Future Council acted as an advisory body for the platform, helped identify key trends and future topics and supported its efforts to drive collaboration among key players. Council outputs An estimated 60-70% of new value created in the economy over the next decade will be based on digitally enabled platforms. 10.2Mandate and objectives 10.1 -Contributed to the World Economic Forum's report Digital Transformation: Powering the Great Reset -Contributed to the World Economic Forum's report New Paradigm for Business of Data -Contributed to the World Economic Forum's report Reimagining Digital Identity: A Strategic Imperative -Supported the design of digital identity collaborative pilots to be advanced by Smart Africa in 2020-2021 -Contributed to the Forum's Transformation Maps Digital Economy and New Value Creation and The Digital Transformation of Business -Contributed to sessions on data, digital business transformation, digital inclusion, digital identity and digital-enabled COVID response at Forum meetings (such as the Annual Meeting 2020 and the Industry Strategy Meeting 2020) and five stand-alone thematic workshops -Published three World Economic Forum Agenda blogs: -How privacy tech is redefining the data economy by CV Madhukar, Investment Partner, Omidyar Network, India -How digital innovations helped banks adapt during COVID-19 by Karin Oertli, Chief Operating Officer, Personal and Corporate Banking and Switzerland, UBS, Switzerland -How next-generation information technologies tackled COVID-19 in China by Qi Xiaoxia, Director-General, Bureau of International Cooperation, Cyberspace Administration of China Network of Global Future Councils 2019-2020 40Co-Chairs Richard \"Dick\" Daniels Executive Vice-President; Chief Information Officer, Kaiser Permanente, USA Karin Oertli Chief Operating Officer, Personal and Corporate Banking and Switzerland, UBS, Switzerland Members Titi Akinsanmi Lead, Government Affairs and Public Policy, West and Francophone Africa, Google, Nigeria Deemah Al Yahya Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Almatad Consulting, Saudi Arabia Azeem Azhar Chief, Exponential View, United Kingdom Khalfan Belhoul Chief Executive Officer, Dubai Future Foundation, United Arab Emirates James Chin Moody Chief Executive Officer, Sendle, Australia Eileen Donahoe Executive Director, Global Digital Policy Incubator, USA Victoria A.

The Global Future Council on Financial and Monetary Systems explored these developments, and assessed not only the emergence of new players, technologies and innovation, but also the risks they pose to society.

The Global Future Council on Geopolitics provided intellectual guidance to the Forum's work in this area, and shaped a number of Forum workstreams including the Global Risks Report. Areas of focus for the council included deciphering an increasingly multiconceptual world, in which intranational and international differences on key norms and values appear to be widening and hardening; examining pressures on existing institutions, agreements and alliances with a view to shaping an agenda for multilateral reform and renewal; and developing a systems view of the geopolitical landscape, with particular attention paid to the intersection of geopolitics with other fields - notably economics, technology, society and the environment.

This is critical if the world is to foster a prosperous, sustainable and inclusive future for all, as articulated through the Sustainable Development Goals. Currently, this aspiration is not on track. The world needs less business-as-usual and more radical and unconventional ideas that can fundamentally change the unsustainable system that was created to govern global public goods during the 20th century. The Global Future Council on Global Public Goods in the Fourth Industrial Revolution shaped a bold and ambitious vision for how to harness and shape the Fourth Industrial Revolution to protect, promote and expand global public goods in service of humanity. The council, through its thought and action leadership, informed and shaped the Forum's Centre for Global Public Goods' strategy in this domain.

Human rights organizations need to invest in renewed capacity and strategic intelligence of the emerging technologies' context to put themselves ahead of the curve and foresee the advent of potentially disruptive technologies with major human rights implications. The Global Future Council on Human Rights and the Fourth Industrial Revolution worked in this direction, providing foresight on the potential of novel frontier technologies and their application to individuals' human rights. It also provided recommendations to technology developers and human rights actors on intervention areas and opportunities to influence the development and application of these technologies for better human rights outcomes.

With the gap between needs and response widening, traditional relief must be accompanied by new solutions with new partners that build independence and support income generation for the most vulnerable communities.

Delivering high-quality sustainable infrastructure will be crucial for building an inclusively prosperous future. However, confusion about the definition of sustainable infrastructure, the efficacy of myriad available benchmarking standards and the difficulty of providing avenues for investment have prevented increased sustainable infrastructure development.

A positive outcome could see dramatic life improvements for millions of North Koreans as the country opens up, connects to South Korea and the rest of the world, and allows freedom and commerce to drive prosperity. Over the past few years, key leaders have committed to making progress on peace, pushing denuclearization, and exploring economic re-engagement. However, the geopolitical environment surrounding the peninsula has not been favourable towards advancing dialogue, with the current COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing effects of sanctions further adding difficulties for the people of North Korea. The Global Future Council on the Korean Peninsula investigated how to contribute to the diplomatic process, and how to eventually rebuild the North Korean economy, reintegrating it into the global system. Working closely with all stakeholders, the council worked on a wide range of ideas, such as connecting specific communities, capacity-building initiatives, research and roadmap development, and high-level meetings. Council outputs The Korean Peninsula contains one of the most significant geopolitical challenges in the world today. 24.2Mandate and objectives 24.1 - Designed and conducted multiple sessions at the annual Jeju Forum 2019 in South Korea, focusing on topics ranging from \"The Fourth Industrial Revolution and South-North Korean Cooperation\" to \"Multilateral Lending Institutions and the North Korean Economy and How to Attract Private Capital to North Korea\" - Special efforts were made to raise public awareness and debate on the efficacy and sustainability of sanctions on DPRK, both at the Jeju Forum, through the session entitled\"Revisiting Sanctions on North Korea\" and a webinar co-organized with the Forum entitled \"A look inside North Korea in the time of COVID: A road map for global policy-makers\" with Hazel Smith, Professor, School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London, United Kingdom; Moon Chung-In, Special Adviser on Unification and National Security to the President of the Republic of Korea; and Ruediger Frank, Department Head and Professor of East Asian Economy and Society, University of Vienna, Austria Network of Global Future Councils 2019-2020 82Co-Chairs Angela Kane Senior Fellow, Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation, Austria Moon Chung-In Special Adviser on Unification and National Security to the President of the Republic of Korea Members Abdulla Saif Al Nuaimi Ambassador of the United Arab Emirates to the Republic of Korea Bradley Babson Consultant, The National Committee on North Korea, USA Sonja Bachman Head, North-East Asia and the Pacific, United Nations Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, New York Thomas J.

Life expectancy has increased to 70 years or more in many countries, the total fertility rate has dropped from 5 to 2.5 in the past seven decades, and it is expected that children under the age of five will be outnumbered by individuals aged 60 or more by 2020. Population ageing brings with its opportunities and obstacles that must be understood and harnessed for actions on ageing and health. Increasing healthy life years is a boon to human welfare. The Global Future Council on Longevity focused on engaging stakeholders to invest in opportunities presented by ageing to support a lifespan approach to healthy longevity, with special focus on: 1. Raising awareness and driving action on healthy longevity on the World Economic Forum's Agenda 2. Raising awareness and driving action on healthy longevity on the global agenda 3. Generating and disseminating new content and insight Council outputs The total fertility rate has dropped from 5 to 2.5 in the past seven decades 25.2Mandate and objectives 25.1 -In collaboration with AARP and the US National Academy of Medicine, convened five conversations about COVID-19 and Ageing Societies, with over 480 participants. In 2020 for the first time in history, there are more people on the planet over the age of 65 than under the age of 5, and the number of people who are 60 years old and above will double to more than 2 billion by 2050. With that context in mind, the dialogue series shared experiences and expertise about how COVID-19 has had a significant impact on older adults. It also explored many promising examples of what is needed to promote healthy ageing and longevity, even in the context of a pandemic. A summary of key takeaways and video highlights was made available in the World Economic Forum's COVID Action Platform live updates. -Published a briefing paper on Healthy Longevity: Redefining and Harnessing the Longevity Economy -Published 12 World Economic Forum Agenda blogs: -GFC members contributions on healthy ageing and longevity: -These countries are most ready to deal with ageing populations by Sze- Yunn Pang, Head Population Health Management, ASEAN Pacific, Royal Philips, Netherlands; and Yvonne Arivalagan, Research Associate, Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore -How to make later life happy, healthy and meaningful by Victor Dzau, President, National Academy of Medicine, USA; and Celynne Balatbat, Special Assistant to the President, National Academy of Medicine, USA -How to get ageing populations to invest in their health by Kazumi Nishikawa, Director, Healthcare Industries Division, Commerce and Service Industry Policy Group, Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan -Here's what you need to know about the future of multi-generational working by Debra Whitman, Executive Vice- President and Chief Public Policy Officer, AARP , USA -Making the most of our 'extra time' - for ourselves and society by Camilla Cavendish, Contributing Editor and Weekly Op-ed Columnist, FT Weekend, Financial Times Group, United Kingdom -For the economy to cope with an ageing population, we must identify new solutions - here's how by David E.

Technologies such as AI hold the promise of solving some of society's most pressing issues, but also present risks, such as inscrutable algorithms, unethical use of data and potential job displacement. The country's National AI Strategy will help address those challenges and focus on deploying a safe and responsible technology capable of increasing the economic potential. The Global Future Council on Russia examined the global discourse on adopting national-level digital economy strategies, with an emphasis on AI. The group of international and Russian stakeholders together addressed these issues, based on international best practices and solutions. Council outputs 33.2Mandate and objectives 33.1 -Through the Council's AI Readiness Index, the group sought to provide a new tool for accelerating AI technology adoption in key sectors and companies, using targeted strategies and evidence-based policy. The council analysed international experience and best practices, including more than 50 reports and initiatives related to AI readiness at the country, industry and company levels, and developed a preliminary framework for industry and company readiness assessment. The approach was integrated into Russia's national AI programme as one of the key policy tools. -The research project, AI Technologies in City Management: AI as Mayor, explored the extent to which AI could ever be able to replace a mayor and how quickly city administration staff could be replaced by AI technologies. Analysis of international best practices in the practical use of AI technologies in city management in various countries was carried out to determine the necessary conditions for the effective use of AI technologies, as well as the most critical risks. Separately, with the participation of employees of the Moscow Government, a review was prepared of AI technologies, which today are used in solving a number of issues on the management of Moscow. In addition, a sociological study explored the opinions and expectations of Muscovites on the scope of functions in city administration that they consider possible to delegate to AI, as well as the timing of the active introduction of AI technologies into city administration.
