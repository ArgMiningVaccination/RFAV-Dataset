Maryland statute further requires that all public colleges and universities submit an annual progress report, approved by the governing board and submitted on its behalf, detailing the implementation of the plan to the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC). MHEC is responsible for ensuring that institutions remain compliant with the diversity goals of the State Plan. Maryland Education Article \u00a710- 211 also requires that all state -aided independent institutions submit to the Maryland Independent Colleges and Universities Association (MICUA) an annual report detailing institutional programs designed to promote diversity within the institution. For the 2021 iteration of this report, all public institutions were required to submit narrative reports detailing the ir definition of diversity, initiatives that had proven successful in enhancing diversity on their campuses, and information regarding the impact that COVID-19 may have had on their efforts to improve diversity. Additionally, public institutions were required to submit a copy of the diversity plans under which they operated during the reporting period. In accordance with the goals of the State Plan, Maryland's colleges and universities have utilized a broad definition of diversity. This report details a number of initiatives and programs that institutions have created and operate in accordance with their diversity plans. It is clear from the detailed institutional narratives included in this report that campuses throughout the State continue to strive towards creating more diversity on their campuses and promoting diversity within their broader communitie s. Introduction In accordance with the important role that cultural diversity plays in education, Maryland Education Article \u00a711-406 requires that all Maryland postsecondary colleges and universities create, implement, and report on a plan for cultural diversity. Maryland Education Article \u00a710-211 also requires that all state -aided independent institutions submit to the Maryland Independent Colleges and Universities Association (MICUA) an annual report detailing institutional programs designed to promote diversity within the institution. For the 2021 iteration of this report, institutions were asked to provide a brief narrative report describing: 1) how institutions define diversity and how this definition was developed; 2) the institutions' most successful new and ongoing initiatives that promote s diversity on each campus; and 3) the impact that COVID-19 may have had or was expected to have on their diversity efforts. Institutions were also asked to submit copies of the diversity plans under which their campus was operating during the 2020-2021 reporting year. Institutional narratives and diversity plans are contained in the appendix to this report. Defining Diversity Maryland's colleges and universities utilize a broad array of definitions of diversity, in accordance with that contained in the 2017-2021 Maryland State Plan for Higher Education, Increasing Student Success with Less Debt.1 As institutional narratives detail, the process of developing these definitions varied from campus to campus, but all utilized input from a wide cross -section of student, faculty, and staff organizations. In this process, institutions also considered more broad concepts, such as equity and inclusiveness, and identified what this might represent within the unique context of their own campus community. Successful Initiatives to Increase Diversity A key contributor to increased diversity on campus is building a diverse student body. Initiatives vary widely by institution, but Maryland colleges and universities use a number of targeted approaches to developing this level of diversity among their student populations. Many institutions have created outreach programs that include community organizations as conduits to reaching groups that have historically been underrepresented in their student body. Additionally, as a way of increasing access to those s tudents who otherwise might financially have been unable to enroll in postsecondary institutions, many institutions offer targeted financial aid to attract those students. As shown in the narratives, the populations these programs focus on and vary widely across the state, as institutions identify those who might most contribute to diversity at their own campus. These initiatives play an important role in ensuring that Maryland's higher education institutions serve all of the State's citizens and continue to provide opportunities to those who have historically been underrepresented in higher education. While a number of the programs employed by Maryland institutions focus on recruiting diverse student populations, there are similarly a wide variety of programs that focus on the success of those students following enrollment - in particular, retention and graduation. The targeted financial aid programs noted above play a key role in ensuring that financial insecurities do not serve as a major impediment to student success. Maryland's institutions also offer continuing academic and social support to students throughout their enrollment. These programs vary greatly from campus to campus, but contain common threads. Targeted mentoring and tutoring programs are employed by many institutions to provide students with academic support that might encourage their success. These types of academic support have historically been the focus of discussions of diversity efforts, but in the changing landscape of higher education, do not adequately address the changing needs of many of those underrepresented in higher education. For example, recent years have seen an explosion in programs such as campus food banks and community resource connections that address potential bar riers to student success that go well beyond their performance in the classroom. The creation of diverse faculty and staff bodies is also critical to developing diversity on a college campus. In order to meet this goal, Maryland institutions have continue d to engage in a number of efforts designed to attract and retain faculty and staff members from a wide array of backgrounds. Many universities have developed programs designed to provide additional support 1 https://mhec.maryland.gov/About/Documents/2017.2021%20Maryland%20State%20Plan%20for%20Higher%20Ed ucation.pdf to traditionally underrepresented students in gra duate programs, with the goal of diversifying the faculty pipeline. In addition to these programs and otherwise widening the scope of hiring outreach, institutions have exerted a significant amount of effort in expanding the extent to which diversity is in corporated into the search and hiring process. Institutions have invested significantly in the creation and training of search committees meant to ensure that all qualified candidates are given equal consideration throughout the hiring process. Additionall y, recognizing that hiring alone will not address concerns regarding equity, many campuses have created programs specifically focused on the retention of diverse faculty and staff. While these vary across institutions, many include enhanced mentoring, training, and professional development designed to promote an inclusive faculty and staff community. Both curricular and co- curricular initiatives also contribute substantially to the creation of an inclusive campus community. 2 Ongoing professional development opportunities regarding incorporation of diverse worldviews and culturally responsive teaching methods into the curriculum continue to be offered at most institutions. General education requirements at every institution throughout the state include some coursework related to diversity, and the courses that fulfill these requirements undergo continuous evaluation. While these efforts remain largely behind the scenes, co- curricular programming - generally the most visible of campus's diversity efforts - continues to take an incredible array of forms at Maryland campuses. As the institutional narratives detail, Maryland's institutions have developed and implemented a tremendous amount of co-curricular programs. While these vary in methods, scope, and even subject, it is clear from the institutional narratives that campuses continue to engage and expand their co -curricular programming in response to contemporary topics and student needs. The Impact of COVID -19 on Diversity Efforts In the 2020-2021, colleges and institutions faced unprecedented challenges due to the impacts of COVID -19. These challenges surfaced in nearly every aspect of campus operations, including enrollment management, course delivery, residential life, and extracurricular activities. Given that many diversity initiatives are heavily intertwined with these operational aspects of campus life, it was inevitable that the effect of COVID -19 might have significant impacts on diversity efforts. As the institutional narratives indicate, one partic ular area of concern as the pandemic began was whether institutions might be able to attract and retain diverse student populations. As the pandemic grew, nearly all sectors of the economy experienced large disruptions in operations. Higher education saw the shutting down of non- academic resources (such as childcare centers) and a shift to mainly distance learning in primary and secondary education. For many student-parents, the combination of these two led to additional childcare burdens that hampered thei r ability to focus on furthering their own education. Despite the fact that the majority of courses were transformed to distance education, physical access posed problems for some students. A small number of courses continued to be offered in 2 While curricular initiatives focus on incorporating topics surrounding diversity directly into the academic functions of the institution, co -curricular initiatives provide a wide array of other experiences for students occurring outside of the classroom, such as film series, speaker series, or other events designed to highlight specific cultures. person, and as communities across the State experienced major interruptions in public transportation due to the pandemic, some students faced challenges in making it to campus for those classes. The pandemic also led to drops in international student enrollment due to ongoing - and ever -evolving - international travel restrictions imposed in response to the pandemic. In a response to both travel restrictions and an abundance of caution, study abroad programs were largely halted. While affecting a much smaller number o f students, Second Chance Pell programs were also paused due to a lack of the access to prison facilities required to deliver courses. It is important to note, however, that not all impacts of COVID-19 on postsecondary enrollment were negative. The pandem ic prompted colleges and universities to invest significantly in developing the infrastructure required for remote course delivery. While part of this investment was technological, institutions also provided professional development and additional support to faculty and staff members to allow them to adapt their courses to an online format. Some institutions also provided additional support to students struggling with a shift to remote learning to encourage their success. Alternative course delivery methods were developed, including hybrid learning and HyFlex 3, that increase access for non -traditional students; now that institutions have invested in developing and implementing these methods, colleges and universities have largely indicated that they will con tinue to utilize them after the pandemic ends. Additionally, the economic impacts of the pandemic, which hit the hospitality and restaurant sector particularly hard, led institutions to seek out ways to work with individuals who had been employed within th ose sectors to help them develop other skills. As noted above, the financial impacts of the pandemic may have contributed to problems with affordability as many students faced significant financial challenges. Many institutions utilized funds provided under the Federal CARES Act as well as their own resources to provide supplemental financial assistance to students. In some cases, this meant providing emergency funding to students who may otherwise have been unable to afford to pay the expenses associated with pursuing higher education, including not only tuition but other traditional costs such as living expenses and textbooks. Many institutions also removed financial impediments such as registration blocks preventing students with outstanding balances from returning. Across all sectors of education, the high cost of accessing the technology required to function in a suddenly- digital world became a major concern regarding access and success. As postsecondary instruction shifted - in whole or in part - to online learning, this cost proved a major barrier to access. As a response, institutional funds were also frequently used to provide students with access to technology, including laptops, printers, specialized software, and internet hotspots. Institutions also sought other ways to support their students with non-financial burdens. For example, food pantries across the State serve as an important tool in reducing food insecurity for students and their families and have been identified as key contributors to student success. The closure of campuses required campuses to find alternative methods by which to deliver food and other necessities to students; at least one campus delivered non-perishable food products directly 3 The HybridFlexible (HyFlex) model provides students with the option to move back -and-forth between attending class virtually or in -person. to students' homes. Some institutions utilized offices on their campuses to help students navigate social and community services. The pandemic also provided campuses with an increased opportunity to serve students' medical needs with increased access to tele- health and tele- mental health offerin gs. A substantial portion of institutions' diversity efforts involve co- curricular activities, nearly always held in a face- to-face setting. With the onset of COVID -19, colleges worked to develop new and innovative ways of delivering co- curricular divers ity programming to students, faculty, and staff. Diversity Plans As noted above, all of Maryland's 29 public institutions are currently compliant with the statutory mandate of maintaining a diversity plan as detailed in Education Article \u00a711 -406. 4 According to statute, these plans must include the following: (i) A description of the way the institution addresses cultural diversity a mong its student, faculty, and staff populations; (ii) A description of how the institution plans to enhance cultural diversity, if improvement is needed; (iii) A process for reporting campus -based hate crimes, as defined under Title 10, Subtitle 3 of the Criminal Law Article and consistent with federal requirements under 20 U.S.C. 1092(f), known as the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act; and (iv) A summary of any resources, including State grants, needed by the institution to effectively recruit and retain a culturally diverse student body. Education Article \u00a711-406 further requires that institutions have their plans reviewed and approved by their governing boards annually. The majority of campuses continue to operate under multi-year plans and provide annual updates to their governing board. Conclusion The State of Maryland and the Maryland State Plan for Higher Education place a high value on ensuring that all of its institutions are inclusive and welcoming spaces for all. Achieving this requires the cultivation of a diverse faculty and staff. Institutions have impl emented a number of strategies designed to improve access and success for all students, faculty, and staff, and provided additional support to those who have been traditionally underrepresented in higher education. 4 As noted above, Article \u00a710- 211 does not require state -aided independent institutions to follow this same process.

The first ever attention to diverse student populations, their unique ne eds, and their full inclusion with the campus community was originally called New Generation College Student Task Force. In 2005, the name was changed to the Diversity Task Force. Immediate achievements were creating a definition of diversity for the Col lege and identifying a key need: creating a Diversity Center. The Task Force defined diversity thusly : \"Diversity is \"otherness\" or those human qualities that are different from our own, [are] outside the groups to which we belong, yet are present in other individuals or groups .\" In the same document, the Task Force wrote, \"Allegany College of Maryland's expanded definition of diversity promotes awareness, appreciation and sensitivity to many demographic types (eg., gender, age, race, ethnicity, physic al abilities/qualities, sexual orientation, educational background, geographic origin, income, marital status, parental status, military status, religious beliefs, work experiences, and more). We do not view our commitment to diversity as lip - service to po litical correctness or mere touch -feely words empty of real meaning. As an educational institution, we are responsible for h elping prepare our students to live, learn, work, and succeed in a diverse society.\" In FY15 , the Diversity Committee was added as a Special Standing Committee for the College and in FY17, the Committee was ta sked by Instruction and Student Affairs with the division goal to increase cultural competence of faculty, staff, and students. To achieve the goal, one key tactic was implemented : Define \"cultural competence\" for the institution . Beginning in Spring 2016, the committee began looking for diversity resources and learning opportunities including free webinars, EAB briefings, trainings, and results of an ACM psychology cla ss project exploring discrimination, stereotypes, and prejudice (\"Making a Difference\"). Any resource with applicable information has been shared with the entire committee. In Summer 2016, the Goal's assigned tasks and timeline was sent to the committee; a small subcommittee of available members met in July, and all members were asked to conduct independent research into the \"gold standard\" definition for \"cultural competence\" and best practices for benchmarking. A collection of 6 possible frameworks was submitted to the entire committee for consideration. The committee was unable to meet the rest of the summer, and the committee membership is subject to change with the new academic year. In Fall 2016, the committee found the \"gold standard\" and adopted, in its entirety, the National Center for Cultural Compe tence (Georgetown University): https://nccc.georgetown.edu/foundations/frameworks.html \"Cultural competence r equires that organizations: have a defined set of values and principles, and demonstrate behaviors, attitudes, policies and structures that enable them to work effectively cross -culturally. have the capacity to (1) value diversity, (2) conduct self -assessment, (3) manage the dynamics of difference, (4) acquire and institutionalize cultural knowledge and (5) adapt to diversity and the cultural contexts of the communities they serve. incorporate the above in all aspects of policy making, administration, practice, service delivery and involve systematically consumers, key stakeholders and communities. 2Section Two : Diversity Initiatives Unity Center The College upgraded, relocated, and re -themed the former Diversity Center which had been housed in the College Center for years to the Unity Center in the Humanities Building. The Unity Center's mission is to provide a space for multi -cultural learning opportunities that engage students, faculty, and staff in meaningful ways. It serves as an educatio nal space for the College's many groups and clubs including its Aspiring Young MENtors who use the center as their headquarters for activities. After the opening in spring 2020, many students spen t time in the Unity Center meeting with friends, studying, p laying games, etc. Numerous faculty/staff groups have also used the Unity Center since it opened. The groups who regularly reserved and used the Unity Center over the last year were: AYM , Weight Watchers , Conn , Tutoring , Disability and Access Resources Department , General Education Assessment , Business Department , Humanities Division , Project Based Learning workshop , Student Emergency Support Committee , Financial Literacy Presentation , and Advocates for Christ . The Unity Center used micro grant funds to purchase two new laptops for student use in the center , a faculty laptop to use with the document camera and projector , and to add additional resources for programming for the fall 2021 sem ester. Aspiring Young M ENtors (AYM) : In the fall of 2018, a mini -grant was applied for at Allegany College with the intent to create an organization that is comprised of a group of African -American male mentors to help guide and support other young Africa n-American men on campus. The graduation rate within 4 years for African -American males attending ACM is around 10% as compared to all other populations at 34%. A major goal of this mini -grant was to establish a support group that could impact student succ ess and growth for this population of students. Mission: Foster student success through a collaborative network of men dedicated to leadership, mentorship, and a growth mindset at Allegany College of Maryland. Vision: Lead young African -American men at Allegany College of Maryland in achieving their dream. Mission : to improve the GPA and retention rates of underserved students. Programs: a series titled \"Mentor Mondays \" hosting guest speaker s. There were ten topics/presenters with varied topics and cons istent attendance of 9 -11 students at each event. Academics: From the 10 original mentors that started this program in Spring 2019, 6 graduated with Associate's Degrees from ACM. From those 6 graduates: two just graduated from Towson University with Bac helor's Degrees; one is finishing year three at UMBC; One is finishing year three at ACM in a 3+1 program. Of the 6 graduates from ACM, their GPAs were 3.42, 3.3, 2.89, 2.81, 2.79, and 2.70, well above the average GPA for African American males at ACM. It should be noted that 9 of these 10 original mentors started in Developmental Education courses at ACM (four started in the 90 -level courses!). 6 of the 10 were/are Pathways for Success students as well. Diversity , Equity, and Inclusion Committee : The Committee planned, requested institutional approval, and implemented all-gender, single -use restrooms on campus - one per building with a map and inclusive signage . The Committee also held its first annual Scholarship Week, which was co -sponsored by Pathwa ys for Success and Student Life. The goal of Scholarship Week was to raise awareness about scholarship opportunities at ACM among traditionally underrepresented students as well as to provide resources and support . Eight students participated in the event, and five students who had not previously explored scholarship opportunities applied for scholarships. Moonshot: ACM is working with four institutions of higher education in the immediate region to explore creat ing a partnershi p in EAB's Moonshot for Equity : an initiative to close the equity gap by 2030. The potential partnership directs member institutions to create a comprehensive equity strategy, identify and remove institutional barriers, implement 15 research -backed best practices, embed change management in institutional transformation, and receive support from national mentors. 3Section Three: Covid -19 Impact While no one can predict precisely how Covid will impact - positively or negatively - student learning or campus operations, the College has identified areas of risk/opportunity . Credit Instruction ACM is unique compared to other Maryland community colleges: 2/3 of our students are in career programs with 1/3 in transfer. We have maintained in -person ins truction in our career programs and clinicals during the pandemic. Currently, plans are for instructional delivery t o return to normal in the fall - where the predominant delivery method is face -to-face. Online, Hyflex and Face -to-Face Alternating offeri ngs have increased to better meet the needs of students who require greater flexibility. Instructional Affairs ' Guided Pathways which define \"meta majors\" will be fully implemented. Meta majors are program clusters that share comm onalities (eg., Health Sciences) and help students to identify and choose a pathway, promoting academic success - particularly for vulnerable populations. Instructional Affairs extended and expanded its Chromebook loaner program for students who lack technology needed for learni ng - particularly remote or virtual learning. This program of providing 25 Chromebook and 20 HP laptops permitted many disadvantaged students to remain enrolled and to learn. Retention /Completion The Financial Aid Termination Appeal Committee will continue to exercise leniency regarding unsuccessful academic performance in FY20 and FY21 due to Covid. The full implementation of Navigate holds great promise; preliminary data from the pilot year (FY21) shows students using the platfor m have higher retention rates than the institutional average. Navigate also allows targeted campaigns to high risk students or other cohorts. The College has created a new position, Retention Specialist, who will provide direct support services to our hig hest risk students including first generation, students not college ready, and students of color. Student Affairs collaborated with UPMC to expand its me ntal health supports and counseling (on -site, off-site, and virtual) in FY22. The new contract will add services available to students and employees including testing for disabilities which has been needed for years. On-campus Housing Willowbrook Woods is the most racially diverse concentration of students at Allegany College of Maryland. Institutional leadership decided in February 2021 that occupancy at Willowbrook Woods would likely be 50% in FY22; therefore, on-site staffing was reduced by 50%. Subsequently, the College set a goal of 100% occupancy albeit with a more likely anticipated rate of 75%. The College also determined that all residents must be vaccinated unless they meet one of two exceptions: medical or religious. At this writing, the College is still developing plans for how to place residents in light of CDC's guidance for vaccinated/unvaccinated students without engaging in any unlawful discrimination (eg., disability, religion). Student Engagement/Programming Typically, the Director of Student Life and members of the Student Government Association (SGA) utilize local, state and national presenters/agencies to provide programs to the College community. This year, due to the pandemic, all events were held online and students were given information about a variety of free events and speakers they could view on a variety of topics provided by a variety of vendors. Whether \"live\" programs by Student Life or Residence Life may resume in accordance with CDC guidelines in a mixed vaccinated/unvaccinated population has not been determined at this writing. If perm itted, \"live\" programs for on -campus residents should have a positive impact on quality of life, adjustment to the college experience, and academic achievement - all of which are tracked by Residence Life via mid -term grade reports, final grade reports, cu mulative GPA data, and annual resident survey. Athletics: All sports programs are expected to run their regula rly scheduled season with vigorous recruitment underway including our minority student -athletes. COVID -19 protocols will impact how those seasons function and overall accessibility to services and staff support including g ym time, weight room time, trainer consults, study hall time and more. We expect FY22 to be improved from FY21. 4Allegany College of Maryland APPENDIX CULTURAL DIVERSITY PLAN 2020 -2021 (Traditional/Legislative Requirements ) ______________________________________________________ ________________ ______________________________ CONTENTS Introduction Part I: Plan to Improve Cultural Diversity Part II: Efforts to Increase the Numerical Representation of Traditionally Underrepresented Groups Part III: Efforts Designed to Create Positive Interactions and Cultural Awareness Part IV: Strategy to increase Faculty/Staff diversity Part V: Reporting of Hate -Based Crimes ________________ ________________ ____________________________________________________________________ Introduction Allegany College of Maryland is a small, public community college with its main campus in Western Maryland's Allegany County, a second campus in Bedford County, Pennsylvania, and teaching sites in downtown Cumberland (Maryland), Garrett County (Maryland), and Somerset County (Pennsylvania) .

Where progress has been achieved and areas where continued improvement are needed. INSTITUTIONAL PLANNING / GOALS The h istory of diversity planning at Allegany College of Maryland traces to the College's assuming management of Willowbrook Woods on -campus housing in 2003 . The first ever attention to diverse student populations , their unique needs, and their full inclusion with the campus community was originally called New Generation College Student Task Force . The group accomplished many goals including conducting 5employee surveys, inviting the Southern Poverty Law Center to assess the College's anti -bias a nd diversity work, bringing \"edutainment\" programs to the campus, helping to establish an ESL (English as Second Language) course, and defining \"diversity\" for our campus. In 2005, the name was changed to the Diversity Task Force . Immediate achievements were creating a definition of diversity for the College and identifying a key need: creating a Diversity Center. The Task Force defined diversity thusly : \"Diversity is \"otherness\" or those human qualities that are different from our own, [are] outside the groups to which we belong, yet are present in other individuals or groups. Allegany College of Maryland's expanded definition of diversity promotes awareness, appreciation and sensitivity to many demographic types (eg., gender, age, race, ethnicity, physi cal abilities/qualities, sexual orientation, educational background, geographic origin, income, marital status, parental status, military status, religious beliefs, work experiences, and more). We do not view our commitment to diversity as lip -service to p olitical correctness or mere touch -feely words empty of real meaning. As an educational institution, we are responsible for helping prepare our students to \"live, learn, work, and succeed in a diverse society.\" Beginning in 2006, diversity activities were tasked to Student Affairs and Residence Life staff thus disbanding the task force ; this small group found space and opened the Diversity Center whose function was to provid e resources, safe gathering space for students, education/advocacy for minority students with faculty/staff, and program planning . In 2008, the Student Life Director became a full time position (compared to a 25% position ) and the new job description included Diversity Center oversight . In 2009, with the passage of legislation by th e Maryland General Assembly, Student Affairs assumed responsibility for writing the annual Diversity Plan/Progress Report submitted to MHEC; the first report was submitted. In April 2015, the Diversity Committee was added as a Special Standing Committee for the College . The objectives for this committee are: Review and work with college community to recommend goals for improving diversity in the workforce, instructional affairs, and student services. Assist in the development and support the college's annual reports relating to diversity. Plan and/or recommend diversity programming for the college community to promote and advocate inclusiveness. The Diversity Committee should be representative of a diversified community (ie, race, color, religion, sex, national origin an d sexual orientation) to include, but not limited to, individuals from the following specialties: Willowbrook Woods student resident, student, Student & Legal Affairs, Human Resources, Associate Support Staff, Faculty, Professional Support Staff. Also that year, Instructional and Student Affairs Annual Goals: Spring 2016 to Spring 2017 identified four broad \"goals\" for one calendar year. Given its importance in both the Strategic Plan and the Educational Master Plan, diversity was highlighted as one o f the small number of divisional \"goals\": increase cultural competence of faculty, staff, and students. The Diversity Committee was tasked with accomplishing this goal with the Dean of Student & Legal Affairs acting as liaison between the Diversity Commi ttee and the Educational Master Plan working group. A detailed action plan was developed; elements of the plan are tactics, timeline, measure, resources, responsible person, justification/support data, and planning document linkage. To achieve the goal, four tactics were implemented. 1. Define \"cultural competence\" for the institution using research and polling students and employees from a selection of nationally used definitions. 2. Assess the extent to which the College is currently culturally competent using its selected definition. 3. Develop reasonable and achievable benchmarks using where the College is \"now\" and additional research of best practices. 4. Develop a plan to improve or reach the benchmarks via programming and educational opportunities. 5. Assign the Diversity Committee's Human Resources representative as a member of or consultant to each College search committee. Thus, the original Diversity Committee members focused on these tactics for its first few years with these achievements: 6 1. Defin e \"cultural competence\" : Beginning in Spring 2016, the committee began looking for diversity resources and learning opportunities including free webinars, EAB briefings, trainings, and results of an ACM psychology class project exploring discrimination, stereotypes, and prejudice (\"Making a Difference\"). Any resource with applicable information has been shared with the entire committee. In Summer 2016, the Goal's assigned tasks and timeline was sent to the committee; a small subcommittee of available me mbers met in July, and all members were asked to conduct independent research into the \"gold standard\" definition for \"cultural competence\" and best practices for benchmarking. A collection of 6 possible frameworks was submitted to the entire committee fo r consideration. The committee was unable to meet the rest of the summer, and the committee membership is subject to change with the new academic year. In Fall 2016, the committee found the \"gold standard\" and adopted, in its entirety, the National Center for Cultural Competence (Georgetown University): https://nccc.georgetown.edu/foundations/frameworks.html \"Cultural competence requires that organizations: have a defined set of values and principles, and demonstrate behaviors, attitudes, policies and structures that enable them to work effectively cross -culturally. have the capacity to (1) value diversity, (2) conduct self -assessment, (3) manage the dynami cs of difference, (4) acquire and institutionalize cultural knowledge and (5) adapt to diversity and the cultural contexts of the communities they serve. incorporate the above in all aspects of policy making, administration, practice, service delivery and involve systematically consumers, key stakeholders and communities. 2. Assess current cultural competence * 3. Develop benchmarks * 4. Develop a plan to improve benchmarks* *Surveys of students, faculty, and staff were conducted in successive years, Fall 2017 and Fall 2018, in order to collect reliable data. The first survey was subsequently determined to be flawed in how the data was reported/presented, but the second survey yielded more reliable results. The Diversity Committee evaluated the results in Spring 2 019, selected that data as our benchmarks, identified areas to improve, and began planning activities for campus education/programs for both students and employees. 5. Assign the Diversity Committee's Human Resources representative as a member of or consul tant to each College search committee. This tactic was complete d and improved over time ; Human Resources has subsequently changed its approach by providing training to multiple College employees to serve as \"committee experts\" one of whom will serve on each search committee to assist with recognizing bias, avoiding inappropriate topics, and more. Beginning in Fall 2019, new committee membership changed direction ; in its first year, the group focus on reading about diversity, holding committee discussions about diversit y, creating a calendar of observances , and exploring methods of communication among committee members a s well as the college community. During the 2019 -2020 academic year , the committee's activity was centered around its premier goal of establishing gender -neutral bathrooms in each campus building. That task was accomplished along with creating a map of which bathrooms had been designated for easy use by students and employees. The Committee's activities in 2020 -2021 are detailed below. In FY20, the Diversity Center morphed into the Unity Center whose activities are described below. AREAS OF EMPHASIS Covid -19: Like all colleges and universities, Allegany College of Maryland was forced to adapt all of its operations during the pandemic caused by the coronavirus. Early in the pandemic, the College chose to follow CDC guidelines , to comply with state mandates in both Maryland and Pennsylvania, and to partner closely with 7the lo cal public health departments in Allegany County and Bedford County. The College formed a Covid Command Team with representation across teaching and services to be the group responsible for overseeing the College's response, for mitigating exposure risk t o all, and for managing any reports of Covid -19 exposure, symptoms, and/or positive tests. The group read any official documents from federal, state, and local public health officials or experts on the pandemic response. These documents included guidance on how to ensure the institution did not engage in any discriminatory practices regarding the health , privacy, or disabilities of students, faculty, and staff while also promoting safe practice s. Examples of the many changes at Allegany College of Maryla nd include quickly creating multiple teaching methods to maximize remote learning where possible, coordinating with faculty to work with students whose absences were required by quarantine or isolation providing all necessary services with minimal on -campus personnel by utilizing technology for teleworking personnel, promoting self-care and using free mental health/support services which were expanded to include virtual sessions, adhering to guidance reg arding leniency with financial aid appeals for students whose academic performance was adversely affected by Covid , high risk activity waiver forms, and much more. Unfortunately, Covid -19 necessarily restricted most on-campus co-curricular and extra -curri cular opportunities for student s with limited recreational or personal enrichment programming possible; most of the College's non -academic activities were virtual this year by necessity. Unity Center After the opening in spring 2020, we had many students spending time in the Unity Center, meeting with friends, studying, playing games, etc. However, COVID obviously drastically changed that in March 2020. In the fall 2020 and Spring 2021, we maintained having two work study students in there, but obviously the center was not utilized as much with lower student traffic on campus. Pathways continues to use the Unity Center for Advising Sessions, and they are scheduled in the space weekly. They held many one -on-one Advising sessions in the Unity Center over th e last year due to it being a large space and offering Plexiglas barriers. They have also used it a handful of times for one -on-one Math tutoring. Prior to the COVID shut down, Richard Cofield held three programming events in there for Pathways students on the topics of financial literacy and academic success. Numerous faculty/staff groups have also used the Unity Center since it opened. The groups who regularly reserved and used the Unity Center over the last year were: AYM , Weight Watchers , Pathways for Success , Connections Tutoring , Disability and Access Resources Department , General Education Assessment , Business Department , Humanities Division , PBL, Student Emergency Support Committee , Financial Literacy Presentation , and Advoc ates for Christ . We also purchased two new laptops for student use in the center and a faculty laptop to use with the document camera and projector. We also just spent the remaining funds of our micro grants to add additional resources for programming f or the fall 2021 semester. Diversity , Equity, and Inclusion Committee : This year, the [renamed] Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee met bi -weekly on Zoom. The Committee continued to work on signage for all -gender, single -use restrooms on campus. The Committee worked in conjunction with various areas at ACM to get this signage and ensure that correct signage was visible on restroom locations and on campus maps. DEI also continued to work toward researching and providing culturally -responsive training for staff and faculty. (The staff member developing this training took a new job at another institution mid -year, so the training was not completed; DEI is working with Hum an Resources to identify a quality training from purchased resources.) The committee also held its first annual Scholarship Week, which was co -sponsored by Pathways for Success and Student Life. The goal of Scholarship Week was to raise awareness about scholarship opportunities at ACM as well as to provide resources and support to students, particularly those who are traditionally underrepresented among scholarship recipients. During Scholarship Week, students had the opportunity to view a tutorial demon strating how to complete ACM's online scholarship application 8recently created by the Advancement team , receive one-on-one instruction through the RAWC - either in- person or virtually - on writing effective scholarship essays , and participate in a virtual student -led Q & A session on how to successfully apply for scholarships . To present and gather information, DEI engaged in the following educational activities: developed a webpage on the ACM website for resources, student groups, reports, relevant policies, and more ; created and distributed a climate survey to students at the end of the spring semester that will help meet student needs in the fall and beyond ; presented the committee's work during Professional Development Day. Title IX: The Dean of Student & Legal Affairs is also the College's Title IX Coordinator and is thus charged with remaining current on legal/regulatory developments related to gender discrimination and properly addressing reports of discrimination regardless of gend er, sexual orientation, or sexual identity. The new Title IX regulations were issued in early May 2020; they contain a heavy emphasis on greater due process and elimination of bias. The College's Title IX policy was revised and new procedures/practices were developed in Spring/Summer 2020 to meet compliance. ADA/504: During FY20, Allegany College of Maryland was selected for a routine audit by the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE ) Division of Career and College Readiness Methods of Administration (MOA). One significant outcome from the MOA was the re vision of the Dean of Student & Legal Affairs job description; that position is now designated as the College's ADA/504 Coordinator. Starting in summer 2020 and continuing throughout FY2 1, the Coordinator began developing institutional guidelines for ADA/504 compliance , identifying t he specifics of the Coordinator's role, conducting research, obtaining professional development including a course from the National Association of College an d University Attorneys, creating an Executive Summary, messaging students/faculty/staff, creating intake processes, adding content to the Student Affairs web page, crafting a comprehensive ADA/504 policy , crafting an Animals on Campus policy that includes service animals, finalizing procedures for support and service animals in on -campus housing, and forming an Advisory Team. All of these efforts relied upon the expertise and experience of the College's Di rector of Academic Access & Disability Resources whose office is charged with managing requests for academic accommodations. Discrimination: The Dean of Student & Legal Affairs is charged with remaining current on legal/regulatory developments related to other forms of discrimination and properly addressing reports of discrimination among students, faculty, or staff. The complaint form and process for responding to complaints is updated annually . (These documents were adapted from and align closely w ith corresponding Title IX documents.) The Dean also presents information about hate -bias to each student group with whom the Dean meets at the start of the academic year and in emails to students. Hate Crimes / Hate -Bias: See Part Five below. Lighthouse : The College contracted with third party vendor Lighthouse Services, Inc. to provide a venue for any person to report misconduct anonymously. Various College officials are designated as administrators and investigators for reports in the follo wing categories: discrimination, Title IX, safety/security, fraud, compliance/ethics, human resources, and athletics. The full rollout of this service was delayed by Covid -19 but was implemented in FY21. The Dean of Student & Legal Affairs receives any re ports discrimination, Title IX, and Athletics; no reports were received in FY21. First Amendment: The College revised and expanded its First Amendment Policy to a more accurately titled \" First Amendment Speech and Expression Policy\" . As a public institution with constitutional obligations which the College is honored to meet, Allegany College of Maryland's policy highlights that diversity of thought, speech, expression, and activities on campus are welcomed with minimal restrictions . The College invites and supports individuals and groups to exercise their First Amendment rights ; many of the programs and events included in Part Three below demonstrate this commitment. Additionally, the Dean of Student & Legal Affairs receives and approves campus event requests as well as ensures that 9spontaneous/unplanned events are not impeded within the reasonable time, place, and manner limits required of all expressive events. Both political and religious groups held successful events on the ma in campus this year. EVALUATION OF PROGRESS Allegany College of Maryland has continued a comprehensive review if its assessm ent and planning throughout FY 21; this review include d all areas of the College. A new Strategic Plan and Educational Master Plan went into effect, and the College has multiple layers of input and review of institutional assessment including new committees, internal processes (including budgetary , academic program review, and operation al unit review ), dedicated employee responsibilities, and even new positions charged with shouldering much of the assessment and planning work. Each unit submits an annual report to the Director of Institutional Effectiveness, Research, and Plannin g. Fu rthermore, each College committee submits an end of year report to the President's Advisory Team to reflect the committee's activities for the year, whether the committee should continue next year, and its plans if the work continues. Additionally, the St rategic Planning Council writes an annual report that addresses progress for each strategic initiative. ________________ ________________ ____________________________________________________________________ PART 2 A description of efforts to increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups among students, administrative staff and faculty - Detail initiatives designed to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented students, staff, and faculty. Both campus -wide and program specific DEMOGRAPHIC DATA / STUDENT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION The charts below highlight the race/ethnic ity in our local community and among our student body (5 years). Allegany County Race/Ethnicity Total Population 71445 White 65066 88.20% 2 or more races 6229 2.30% Hispanic 150 1.80% Black or African American Indian/Alaska Native 75 0.10% 9981 13.30% Source: 2019 Census Population 5 -year Estimates (ACS) Student racial/ethnic distribution Fall 2016 Fall 2017 Fall 2018 Fall 2019 Fall 2020 a. Hispanic/Latino 0.20% 0.30% 0.08% 0.10% 0.10% d. Native of Maryland Accountability Report The majority of Allegany College of Maryland's underrepresented minority students reside in Willowbrook Woods, ACM's on campus housing facility which is described in Part IV. According to Institutional Research, 72% of Willowbrook Woods residents were minority in Fall 20 20 (for the Fall/Spring contract term) . A llegany College of Maryland offers on -campus apartments for up to 22 8 full time credit students of all socio -economic classes (largely low income and first -generation college students), races/ethnicities. geographic roots (mix of students from Maryland's metropolitan region and rural , multi - state locations), and college -preparedness (a significant number of residents take at least one developmental course and numerous residents are enrolled in highly competitive/demanding allied health programs). Due to Covid mitigation measures, occ upancy in Willowbrook Woods during 2020 -2021 was reduced to approximately 50% to allow each resident to have exclusive use of a bathroom and apartment hallway to reduce risk of transmission and to facilitate any necessary quarantine or isolation. Other Co vid changes in Residence Life this year were virtual programs which were all entertainment/coping focused rather than community -building or educational as in prior years which were often centered on diversity . Specific language f rom the Willowbrook Woods application emphasizes the importance of diversity : \"All students are expected to be full -time, degree -seeking students. Willowbrook Woods is a highly diverse living & learning community. Residents are selected based upon a variety of factors: overall q uality of application, academic program or major, timeliness of application, criminal and/or disciplinary record (if any), quality of interactions with staff members, and more. Allegany College of Maryland does not discriminate against students or prospect ive students for reasons of race, sex, color, religion, national/ethnic origin, age, veteran status, conditions of disability, or sexual orientation. Our commitment to fairness applies to applications, contracting, room assignments, programming, support, r ule enforcement, or any other aspect of residence life. \" The application packet was revised in 2020; it now focuses to a much greater degree on roommate compatibility. To ensure absolute fairness in the selection of residents, demographic data (except for age and gender) is not collected on the applicatio ns, and roommate assignments are made based upon information from the Roommate Matching Form which includes program/major and elicits particulars of compatibility such as interests, socializing tendenci es, study habits, noise, cleanliness, and smoking (ie., the issues which are the most frequent sources of roommate conflict). In order to be as inclusive as possible, Residence Life Staff asks these two questions on the Roommate Matching Form: 1. Gender Id entity choices : Male, Female, Trans or Transgender, Another Identity 2. Gender based room assignment choices : Male, Female, Gender Neutral Marketing/Recruitment: Traditionally, college recruitment staff attends multiple local and regional college and career fairs, with the goal of recruiting students, including underrepresented students. Campus tours are coordinated with high school counselors as well as families, both from rural and urban locations, with the goal of providing opportunities to recruit students from underrepresented backgrounds. Unfortunately, due to COVID -19, neither of these initiatives took place in FY2021. The ACM Recruitment staff was also unab le to 11attend programs or offer special events that support the recruitment of and services to underrepresented students due to COVID -19. Many traditional events and recruitment avenues to reach prospective students have been suspended since March 2020. The few opportunities to recruit and reach underrepresented minority students that were available in academic year 2020 -21 are: 1. Work Experience (WEX) program - Presentations to students enrolled in the WEX program. WEX is a job readiness program that focuses on building skills and developing the potential of parents receiving State assistance. (virtual) 2. Next Generation Scholars - The Next Generation Scholarship is a state grant program established by Maryland House Bill 1403 that provides funding for college a ccess through nonprofit organizations to enhance college and career awareness and college completion for low -income underserved Maryland high school students. The Next Generation Scholars program is available at Washington Middle and Fort Hill High Schools in Cumberland, Maryland. (virtual and in -person) 3. Naviance - a partnership was established with Hobsons to gain prospective student leads from areas in Maryland and Virginia with a more diverse population. As leads are received, follow up communications ar e sent to students. Additionally, important information is shared via the counselor community message board. 4. Adult Basic Education Display - Development of a display featuring Adult Basic Education was added to the Gateway Center's window display case to h elp encourage Maryland residents to finish earning their high school diploma or assistance with basic skills for employment. In addition, PR staff assisted with promotion of monthly virtual and in -person orientation sessions for students seeking their GED. Additionally, Allegany College of Maryland has a variety of programs and special projects that support the recruitment of and services to underrepresented students. A summary is provided below: 1. Pathways for Success is a TRIO Student Support Services pr oject to increase retention, graduation, and transfer rates of eligible students, as well as improve student grade point averages. The program provides a supportive environment on campus for underrepresented students with low -income or first-generation st atus and students with disabilities. The program offers tutoring in math, science, and writing/English, one -on-one academic advising, career advising, transfer advising, financial aid advising, peer mentoring, support groups, and workshops on topics such a s financial literacy. 2. Centralized Academic Advising in Rural Appalachia: Ensuring Student Success and Completion (a Title III program) enables the College to improve academic advising services to students, including underrepresented students, to boost their chances for success and will consolidate academic advising services in one location for greater access and more consistent delivery. This one -stop advising services center, located in the College Center, includes a wide range of academic advising, c areer planning, supportive counseling, educational coaching and mentoring services. 3. Consolidated Adult Education and Family Literacy Services offers a variety of programs and services to prepare underrepresented students for high school equivalency and lit eracy services for family and workforce development. Adults and out -of-school youth without a high school diploma have the option of completing secondary education through GED testing or the National External Diploma Program. Successful students by either approach are issued a Maryland high school diploma. Family literacy services, the second key part of adult education, help adults become literate for employment and self -sufficiency and enable them to become full partners in the educational development o f their children. Community outreach is a major emphasis, and the adult education program works with such agencies as the Human Resources Development Commission, Social Services of Allegany County, the YMCA Family Support Center and the local American Job Center. STAFF AND FACULTY RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION Human Resources' current efforts to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented groups include the notice of nondiscrimination and the fact that we are an EEOC employer. HR sends job postings to Higher Ed Jobs with diversity boosts for faculty positions to help attract all potential candidates that read that publication, as well as using various online and social platforms such as Monster, Indeed, Glassdoor, and regional print publications. 12According to the most recent data available from Human Resources (FY 21), ACM had the following staffing percentages: Recruitment FY21 Data from 7/1/2020 - 5/13/2021 Applicants % Applied Hired Hired TOTAL Applicants 279 22 Male 118 42% 11 50% Female 136 49% 11 50% Non -disclosed 25 9% American Indian 1 0% 0% Asian 16 0% 6% 0% Hispanic/Latino 3% 0% Two or White 208 75% 22 100% Undisclosed 25 9% 0% Veteran 15 5% 2 9% Not a Veteran 242 87% 19 86% Not disclosed 22 8% 0% Disabled 21 8% 1 5% Not Disabled 219 78% 18 82% Not Disclosed 39 14% 0% Retention From EDS report FY2021 FT Faculty Minority 2.15% FT Faculty non -white 1.08% FT Faculty & Staff/Minority 2.12% FT Faculty & Staff/Non -white 1.41% PT Faculty & Staff Minority 5.91% PT Faculty & Staff Non -white 4.30% Payroll ending 11/15 FT and PT Staff FT 283 PT 186 TOTAL 469 White, Hispanic 5 Non -white 12 Non -white 2.56% 13Minority 3.62% According to the most recent data available from Institutional Effectiveness, Research, and Planning (FY21), ACM had the following staffing percentages: Fall 2016 Fall 2017 Fall 2018 Fall 2019 Fall 2020 Percent Minority Full -Time Faculty 1.90% 2.00% 3.00% 3.20% 2.20% 0.90% 1.30% 1.80% 1.80% 1.00% Percent of Employees Responding Strongly Agree or Agree: 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 The College demonstrates commitment valuing diversity 82% 79% 81% 84% Source: ACM Employee -2020 The President and Director of Institutiona l Effectiveness, Research , and Planning conducted the annual internal Employee Satisfaction Survey in Fall 20 20 as well as the Chronicle of Higher Education's survey in the hopes of achieving that publication's designation as a Great College to Work For to enhance recruitment and retention . The results remain encouraging and show steady progress at the institution. For both retention and teaching excellence , faculty has updated and implemented its peer mentor program which is now mandatory for new facu lty; that process has been reviewed and improved extensively by the Educational Innovations Committee and the subcommittee working group led by Associate Professor Robin Seddon . Additionally, all faculty who teach online or blended classes are required to complete a new self - paced online course, Accessibility and Your Online Course , as well as comply with a new eCourse policy for quality assurance including accessibility standards. Search Committee Experts HR continues to train and use a team of search committee experts. The training these individuals receive allows them to recognize common recruiting biases, avoid inappropriate topics, to read congruency between candidates' words / expressions / body language, and to point these factors out to other peo ple on their search committees that they have been assigned to . Every search committee is required to have one of these individuals on the committee. These changes were made to enhance this aspect of our institution to help ensure that we hire the best ca ndidates possible for open positions, while also assuring that we maintain non - discriminatory hiring practices. ________________ ________________ ____________________________________________________________________ PART 3 A description of efforts designed to create positive interactions and cultural awareness among students, faculty and staff on campus. - Faculty and staff cultural training programs - Curricular initiatives that promote cultural diversity in the classroom - Co-curricular programming for students Faculty and staff All new, full time Faculty, and all Professional and Associate Support Staff are required to complete harassment training which includes sexual harassment. Additionally, pursuant to the regulations in place during FY2 1, every new ACM emp loyee is required to receive Title IX training during his/her first year of employment. The Title IX Coordinator provided updated information regarding the new regulations to all employees via messaging and webpage documents. 14 Curricular Initiatives The Nursing Program (Karisa White, Instructor) developed new simulations for learning that focus on how to treat and support transgendered patients. Two scenarios were adopted within the nursing curriculum. The first scenario involved a male transgender patient having breast tenderness, redness, and discharge. Patient comes to the Emergency Department to be seen and the Mammogram and Ultrasound show that the patient has breast cancer and recommend follow up with oncology and a breast spe cialist. In this scenario the student will not be directly told that the patient is a transgender but after looking at the diagnostic test results they will need to identify that the patient is a transgender and use therapeutic communication in order to as k some hard or difficult assessment questions. The second scenario involves a female transgender patient having trouble starting the urine stream, frequency, and nocturia. The patient comes to the Emergency Department for lower abdominal pain and has an ab dominal Cat Scan showing an enlarged prostate. For this situation the student will need to use therapeutic communication to explain to the patient and her husband what is happening and how to treat prostate issue. They will also have to identify signs and symptoms of prostate cancer and be able to educate their patient in regards to what they should be monitoring for. General Education Personal & Civic Responsibility Goal: Faculty are designated each year to list personal and civic responsibility as a lear ning outcome for students. Faculty participate in trainings that foster shared understanding of the goal, expectations for proficiency, and t eaching and learning strategies . Co-Curricular Programming Aspiring Young Mentors (AYM) : Our mission remains the same -to improve the GPA and retention rates of underserved students. Fall 2020 - Chandler Sagal, Ashley Dively, and the AYM Student Mentors developed a series titled \"Mentor Mondays.\" Every Monday at 12, we had a guest speaker lead a session that was ope n to ANY and ALL students at ACM. The topics/presenters were: Motiv ation/Goal Setting (11 students), Mind -Body Skills (8 students) , Coping with Anxiety and Stress Relieving Strategies (7 students) , Navigating COVID as a student (9 students) , Food insecurit y and resources for students (10 students) , On Course, Using Creator Language (5 students) , Dress for Success for Job Interviews (11 students) , Motivation and Perseverance (9 students) . Mind -Body Skills (9 students) , and Current/ Previous Mentors -End of Sem ester Celebration (11 students) . From the 10 original mentors that started this program in Spring 2019, 6 graduated with Associate's Degrees from ACM. From those 6 graduates: two just graduated from Towson University with Bachelor's Degrees; one is finish ing year three at UMBC; One is finishing year three at ACM in a 3+1 program. Of the 6 graduates from ACM, their GPAs were 3.42, 3.3, 2.89, 2.81, 2.79, and 2.70, well above the average GPA for African American males at ACM. It should be noted that 9 of the se 10 original mentors started in Developmental Education courses at ACM (four started in the 90 -level courses!). 6 of the 10 were/are Pathways for Success students as well. Current mentors include three males and two females who we hope will help to build our program this fall. Black History Month ACM's College to Community Partnership Center promoted free, online events offered by the Smithsonian's African Amer ican History and Culture Museum during Black History Month. \"Four Hundred Souls\" an Online Lecture and Discussion Renowned scholars Ibram X. Kendi, author of How to Be an Antiracist, and Keisha N.

Musical performances, a \"mind and body\" meditation, and \"art with a message\" will also be woven into the evening's program Donald Alexander Library : The staff have purposefully developed themed displays and grouped reading materials to promote cultural awareness where the students typically associated with cultural observances (weekly, monthly). Student Life / Student Government Association / Student Clubs Allegany College of Maryland, through its Student Government Association, recognized 30 Student Clubs in FY 21, although most paused their meetings/ activities due to the pandemic . Active clubs that promote diversity include the Student Government Association, Advocates 4 Christ, Choir, Culture Club, Nurse's Christian Fellowship Club, Peace Club, Phi Theta Kappa, Veteran Support Club, Volunteer Club, PRIDE (LGBTQ/Ally Club), and 21 academic -related clubs and honor societies. Typically, the Direct or of Student Life and members of the Student Government Association (SGA) utilize local, state and national presenters/agencies to provide programs to the College community. This year, due to the pandemic, all events were held online and students were given information about a variety of free events and speakers they could view on a variety of topics provided by a variety of vendors. In FY21, the following programs were presented virtually (often in partnership with other campus groups such as the Democr acy Commitment) and were open to all students, faculty, staff, and community members.

In recognition of the need for a more diverse faculty and staff, Human Resources began a robust and targeted strategy to expand advertising, including more targeted advertising to recruit job applicants. The strategy included these efforts: posting faculty a nd higher -level professional positions on Higher ED Jobs with an extra diversity package boost , working with Marketing to increase the Facebook posts of open positions , and producing and airing a local radio ad with Forever Media ________________ __________ ______ ____________________________________________________________________ PART 5 Process for the reporting of hate -based crimes consistent with federal requirements. Allegany College of Maryland collects data annually from the following reporting sources : Campus Security / Public Saf ety Cumberland City Police Pennsylvania State Police (Bedford County) Student & Legal Affairs (Cumberland campus) Student Services Director ( Bedford campus) The hate crimes data which must be collected includes murder/non -negligent manslaughter, negligent manslaughter, sex offenses (forcible), sex offenses (non -forcible), robbery, aggravated assault, motor vehicle theft, arson, any crime involving bodily injur y, larceny/theft, simple assault, intimidation, and vandalism/destruction of property. The Violence Against Women Act added the following additional crimes and hate crimes: domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. The reports must specify the w hether the hate crime targeted by race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, disability, or ethnicity/national origin; by federal law, gender identity has been added as a new hate crime category. Crimes also note the location of the crime (ie., on campus , student housing, non -campus, or [adjacent] public property). This data is compiled and submitted electronically to the U.S . Department of Education by October each year . The written report containing both statistics and narrative content is completed each summer, published, and posted online; all students and all employees are notified electronically twice per year. No hate crimes were reported in FY21. NOTE: the [2006] Code of Student Conduct was revised in FY21 (formally approved in August 2020); the revision added a new section provision for hate crimes and hate -bias incidents committed by students. VII.E. Hate - Bias 1. Hate Crime: an offense that manifests evidence that the victim was intentionally selected because of the perpetrator's bias against the victim on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, national origin, or disability. 2. Hate -Bias Incident: a hostile act of conduct, speech, or exp ression motivated in whole or in part by intolerance, bias, or prejudice against another. Unlike a hate crime, the hostile act is not a criminal act; like a hate crime, the hostile act is motivated by prejudice. 19Allegany College of Maryland ANNUAL DIVERSITY REPORT Academic Year 20 20-2021 (Modified Requirements ) Dr. Cynthia Bambara, President Board of Trustees: Kim Leonard, Chair Jane Belt, Vice Chair Mirjhana Buck Linda W.

Appendix : Diversity Plan Report Page s 5-20 The traditional plan and report required by Maryland law . ______________________________________________________ ________________ ______________________________ 20Section One: Definition of Diversity The history of diversity planning at Allegany College of Maryland traces to the College's assuming management of Willowbrook Woods on -campus housing in 2003. The first ever attention to diverse student populations, their unique ne eds, and their full inclusion with the campus community was originally called New Generation College Student Task Force. In 2005, the name was changed to the Diversity Task Force. Immediate achievements were creating a definition of diversity for the Col lege and identifying a key need: creating a Diversity Center. The Task Force defined diversity thusly : \"Diversity is \"otherness\" or those human qualities that are different from our own, [are] outside the groups to which we belong, yet are present in other individuals or groups .\" In the same document, the Task Force wrote, \"Allegany College of Maryland's expanded definition of diversity promotes awareness, appreciation and sensitivity to many demographic types (eg., gender, age, race, ethnicity, physic al abilities/qualities, sexual orientation, educational background, geographic origin, income, marital status, parental status, military status, religious beliefs, work experiences, and more). We do not view our commitment to diversity as lip - service to po litical correctness or mere touch -feely words empty of real meaning. As an educational institution, we are responsible for h elping prepare our students to live, learn, work, and succeed in a diverse society.\" In FY15 , the Diversity Committee was added as a Special Standing Committee for the College and in FY17, the Committee was ta sked by Instruction and Student Affairs with the division goal to increase cultural competence of faculty, staff, and students. To achieve the goal, one key tactic was implemented : Define \"cultural competence\" for the institution . Beginning in Spring 2016, the committee began looking for diversity resources and learning opportunities including free webinars, EAB briefings, trainings, and results of an ACM psychology cla ss project exploring discrimination, stereotypes, and prejudice (\"Making a Difference\"). Any resource with applicable information has been shared with the entire committee. In Summer 2016, the Goal's assigned tasks and timeline was sent to the committee; a small subcommittee of available members met in July, and all members were asked to conduct independent research into the \"gold standard\" definition for \"cultural competence\" and best practices for benchmarking. A collection of 6 possible frameworks was submitted to the entire committee for consideration. The committee was unable to meet the rest of the summer, and the committee membership is subject to change with the new academic year. In Fall 2016, the committee found the \"gold standard\" and adopted, in its entirety, the National Center for Cultural Compe tence (Georgetown University): https://nccc.georgetown.edu/foundations/frameworks.html \"Cultural competence r equires that organizations: have a defined set of values and principles, and demonstrate behaviors, attitudes, policies and structures that enable them to work effectively cross -culturally. have the capacity to (1) value diversity, (2) conduct self -assessment, (3) manage the dynamics of difference, (4) acquire and institutionalize cultural knowledge and (5) adapt to diversity and the cultural contexts of the communities they serve. incorporate the above in all aspects of policy making, administration, practice, service delivery and involve systematically consumers, key stakeholders and communities. 21Section Two : Diversity Initiatives Unity Center The College upgraded, relocated, and re -themed the former Diversity Center which had been housed in the College Center for years to the Unity Center in the Humanities Building. The Unity Center's mission is to provide a space for multi -cultural learning opportunities that engage students, faculty, and staff in meaningful ways. It serves as an educatio nal space for the College's many groups and clubs including its Aspiring Young MENtors who use the center as their headquarters for activities. After the opening in spring 2020, many students spen t time in the Unity Center meeting with friends, studying, p laying games, etc. Numerous faculty/staff groups have also used the Unity Center since it opened. The groups who regularly reserved and used the Unity Center over the last year were: AYM , Weight Watchers , Conn , Tutoring , Disability and Access Resources Department , General Education Assessment , Business Department , Humanities Division , Project Based Learning workshop , Student Emergency Support Committee , Financial Literacy Presentation , and Advocates for Christ . The Unity Center used micro grant funds to purchase two new laptops for student use in the center , a faculty laptop to use with the document camera and projector , and to add additional resources for programming for the fall 2021 sem ester. Aspiring Young M ENtors (AYM) : In the fall of 2018, a mini -grant was applied for at Allegany College with the intent to create an organization that is comprised of a group of African -American male mentors to help guide and support other young Africa n-American men on campus. The graduation rate within 4 years for African -American males attending ACM is around 10% as compared to all other populations at 34%. A major goal of this mini -grant was to establish a support group that could impact student succ ess and growth for this population of students. Mission: Foster student success through a collaborative network of men dedicated to leadership, mentorship, and a growth mindset at Allegany College of Maryland. Vision: Lead young African -American men at Allegany College of Maryland in achieving their dream. Mission : to improve the GPA and retention rates of underserved students. Programs: a series titled \"Mentor Mondays \" hosting guest speaker s. There were ten topics/presenters with varied topics and cons istent attendance of 9 -11 students at each event. Academics: From the 10 original mentors that started this program in Spring 2019, 6 graduated with Associate's Degrees from ACM. From those 6 graduates: two just graduated from Towson University with Bac helor's Degrees; one is finishing year three at UMBC; One is finishing year three at ACM in a 3+1 program. Of the 6 graduates from ACM, their GPAs were 3.42, 3.3, 2.89, 2.81, 2.79, and 2.70, well above the average GPA for African American males at ACM. It should be noted that 9 of these 10 original mentors started in Developmental Education courses at ACM (four started in the 90 -level courses!). 6 of the 10 were/are Pathways for Success students as well. Diversity , Equity, and Inclusion Committee : The Committee planned, requested institutional approval, and implemented all-gender, single -use restrooms on campus - one per building with a map and inclusive signage . The Committee also held its first annual Scholarship Week, which was co -sponsored by Pathwa ys for Success and Student Life. The goal of Scholarship Week was to raise awareness about scholarship opportunities at ACM among traditionally underrepresented students as well as to provide resources and support . Eight students participated in the event, and five students who had not previously explored scholarship opportunities applied for scholarships. Moonshot: ACM is working with four institutions of higher education in the immediate region to explore creat ing a partnershi p in EAB's Moonshot for Equity : an initiative to close the equity gap by 2030. The potential partnership directs member institutions to create a comprehensive equity strategy, identify and remove institutional barriers, implement 15 research -backed best practices, embed change management in institutional transformation, and receive support from national mentors. 22Section Three: Covid -19 Impact While no one can predict precisely how Covid will impact - positively or negatively - student learning or campus operations, the College has identified areas of risk/opportunity . Credit Instruction ACM is unique compared to other Maryland community colleges: 2/3 of our students are in career programs with 1/3 in transfer. We have maintained in -person ins truction in our career programs and clinicals during the pandemic. Currently, plans are for instructional delivery t o return to normal in the fall - where the predominant delivery method is face -to-face. Online, Hyflex and Face -to-Face Alternating offeri ngs have increased to better meet the needs of students who require greater flexibility. Instructional Affairs ' Guided Pathways which define \"meta majors\" will be fully implemented. Meta majors are program clusters that share comm onalities (eg., Health Sciences) and help students to identify and choose a pathway, promoting academic success - particularly for vulnerable populations. Instructional Affairs extended and expanded its Chromebook loaner program for students who lack technology needed for learni ng - particularly remote or virtual learning. This program of providing 25 Chromebook and 20 HP laptops permitted many disadvantaged students to remain enrolled and to learn. Retention /Completion The Financial Aid Termination Appeal Committee will continue to exercise leniency regarding unsuccessful academic performance in FY20 and FY21 due to Covid. The full implementation of Navigate holds great promise; preliminary data from the pilot year (FY21) shows students using the platfor m have higher retention rates than the institutional average. Navigate also allows targeted campaigns to high risk students or other cohorts. The College has created a new position, Retention Specialist, who will provide direct support services to our hig hest risk students including first generation, students not college ready, and students of color. Student Affairs collaborated with UPMC to expand its me ntal health supports and counseling (on -site, off-site, and virtual) in FY22. The new contract will add services available to students and employees including testing for disabilities which has been needed for years. On-campus Housing Willowbrook Woods is the most racially diverse concentration of students at Allegany College of Maryland. Institutional leadership decided in February 2021 that occupancy at Willowbrook Woods would likely be 50% in FY22; therefore, on-site staffing was reduced by 50%. Subsequently, the College set a goal of 100% occupancy albeit with a more likely anticipated rate of 75%. The College also determined that all residents must be vaccinated unless they meet one of two exceptions: medical or religious. At this writing, the College is still developing plans for how to place residents in light of CDC's guidance for vaccinated/unvaccinated students without engaging in any unlawful discrimination (eg., disability, religion). Student Engagement/Programming Typically, the Director of Student Life and members of the Student Government Association (SGA) utilize local, state and national presenters/agencies to provide programs to the College community. This year, due to the pandemic, all events were held online and students were given information about a variety of free events and speakers they could view on a variety of topics provided by a variety of vendors. Whether \"live\" programs by Student Life or Residence Life may resume in accordance with CDC guidelines in a mixed vaccinated/unvaccinated population has not been determined at this writing. If perm itted, \"live\" programs for on -campus residents should have a positive impact on quality of life, adjustment to the college experience, and academic achievement - all of which are tracked by Residence Life via mid -term grade reports, final grade reports, cu mulative GPA data, and annual resident survey. Athletics: All sports programs are expected to run their regula rly scheduled season with vigorous recruitment underway including our minority student -athletes. COVID -19 protocols will impact how those seasons function and overall accessibility to services and staff support including g ym time, weight room time, trainer consults, study hall time and more. We expect FY22 to be improved from FY21. 23Allegany College of Maryland APPENDIX CULTURAL DIVERSITY PLAN 2020 -2021 (Traditional/Legislative Requirements ) ______________________________________________________ ________________ ______________________________ CONTENTS Introduction Part I: Plan to Improve Cultural Diversity Part II: Efforts to Increase the Numerical Representation of Traditionally Underrepresented Groups Part III: Efforts Designed to Create Positive Interactions and Cultural Awareness Part IV: Strategy to increase Faculty/Staff diversity Part V: Reporting of Hate -Based Crimes ________________ ________________ ____________________________________________________________________ Introduction Allegany College of Maryland is a small, public community college with its main campus in Western Maryland's Allegany County, a second campus in Bedford County, Pennsylvania, and teaching sites in downtown Cumberland (Maryland), Garrett County (Maryland), and Somerset County (Pennsylvania) .

Where progress has been achieved and areas where continued improvement are needed. INSTITUTIONAL PLANNING / GOALS The h istory of diversity planning at Allegany College of Maryland traces to the College's assuming management of Willowbrook Woods on -campus housing in 2003 . The first ever attention to diverse student populations , their unique needs, and their full inclusion with the campus community was originally called New Generation College Student Task Force . The group accomplished many goals including conducting 24employee surveys, inviting the Southern Poverty Law Center to assess the College's anti -bias a nd diversity work, bringing \"edutainment\" programs to the campus, helping to establish an ESL (English as Second Language) course, and defining \"diversity\" for our campus. In 2005, the name was changed to the Diversity Task Force . Immediate achievements were creating a definition of diversity for the College and identifying a key need: creating a Diversity Center. The Task Force defined diversity thusly : \"Diversity is \"otherness\" or those human qualities that are different from our own, [are] outside the groups to which we belong, yet are present in other individuals or groups. Allegany College of Maryland's expanded definition of diversity promotes awareness, appreciation and sensitivity to many demographic types (eg., gender, age, race, ethnicity, physi cal abilities/qualities, sexual orientation, educational background, geographic origin, income, marital status, parental status, military status, religious beliefs, work experiences, and more). We do not view our commitment to diversity as lip -service to p olitical correctness or mere touch -feely words empty of real meaning. As an educational institution, we are responsible for helping prepare our students to \"live, learn, work, and succeed in a diverse society.\" Beginning in 2006, diversity activities were tasked to Student Affairs and Residence Life staff thus disbanding the task force ; this small group found space and opened the Diversity Center whose function was to provid e resources, safe gathering space for students, education/advocacy for minority students with faculty/staff, and program planning . In 2008, the Student Life Director became a full time position (compared to a 25% position ) and the new job description included Diversity Center oversight . In 2009, with the passage of legislation by th e Maryland General Assembly, Student Affairs assumed responsibility for writing the annual Diversity Plan/Progress Report submitted to MHEC; the first report was submitted. In April 2015, the Diversity Committee was added as a Special Standing Committee for the College . The objectives for this committee are: Review and work with college community to recommend goals for improving diversity in the workforce, instructional affairs, and student services. Assist in the development and support the college's annual reports relating to diversity. Plan and/or recommend diversity programming for the college community to promote and advocate inclusiveness. The Diversity Committee should be representative of a diversified community (ie, race, color, religion, sex, national origin an d sexual orientation) to include, but not limited to, individuals from the following specialties: Willowbrook Woods student resident, student, Student & Legal Affairs, Human Resources, Associate Support Staff, Faculty, Professional Support Staff. Also that year, Instructional and Student Affairs Annual Goals: Spring 2016 to Spring 2017 identified four broad \"goals\" for one calendar year. Given its importance in both the Strategic Plan and the Educational Master Plan, diversity was highlighted as one o f the small number of divisional \"goals\": increase cultural competence of faculty, staff, and students. The Diversity Committee was tasked with accomplishing this goal with the Dean of Student & Legal Affairs acting as liaison between the Diversity Commi ttee and the Educational Master Plan working group. A detailed action plan was developed; elements of the plan are tactics, timeline, measure, resources, responsible person, justification/support data, and planning document linkage. To achieve the goal, four tactics were implemented. 1. Define \"cultural competence\" for the institution using research and polling students and employees from a selection of nationally used definitions. 2. Assess the extent to which the College is currently culturally competent using its selected definition. 3. Develop reasonable and achievable benchmarks using where the College is \"now\" and additional research of best practices. 4. Develop a plan to improve or reach the benchmarks via programming and educational opportunities. 5. Assign the Diversity Committee's Human Resources representative as a member of or consultant to each College search committee. Thus, the original Diversity Committee members focused on these tactics for its first few years with these achievements: 25 1. Defin e \"cultural competence\" : Beginning in Spring 2016, the committee began looking for diversity resources and learning opportunities including free webinars, EAB briefings, trainings, and results of an ACM psychology class project exploring discrimination, stereotypes, and prejudice (\"Making a Difference\"). Any resource with applicable information has been shared with the entire committee. In Summer 2016, the Goal's assigned tasks and timeline was sent to the committee; a small subcommittee of available me mbers met in July, and all members were asked to conduct independent research into the \"gold standard\" definition for \"cultural competence\" and best practices for benchmarking. A collection of 6 possible frameworks was submitted to the entire committee fo r consideration. The committee was unable to meet the rest of the summer, and the committee membership is subject to change with the new academic year. In Fall 2016, the committee found the \"gold standard\" and adopted, in its entirety, the National Center for Cultural Competence (Georgetown University): https://nccc.georgetown.edu/foundations/frameworks.html \"Cultural competence requires that organizations: have a defined set of values and principles, and demonstrate behaviors, attitudes, policies and structures that enable them to work effectively cross -culturally. have the capacity to (1) value diversity, (2) conduct self -assessment, (3) manage the dynami cs of difference, (4) acquire and institutionalize cultural knowledge and (5) adapt to diversity and the cultural contexts of the communities they serve. incorporate the above in all aspects of policy making, administration, practice, service delivery and involve systematically consumers, key stakeholders and communities. 2. Assess current cultural competence * 3. Develop benchmarks * 4. Develop a plan to improve benchmarks* *Surveys of students, faculty, and staff were conducted in successive years, Fall 2017 and Fall 2018, in order to collect reliable data. The first survey was subsequently determined to be flawed in how the data was reported/presented, but the second survey yielded more reliable results. The Diversity Committee evaluated the results in Spring 2 019, selected that data as our benchmarks, identified areas to improve, and began planning activities for campus education/programs for both students and employees. 5. Assign the Diversity Committee's Human Resources representative as a member of or consul tant to each College search committee. This tactic was complete d and improved over time ; Human Resources has subsequently changed its approach by providing training to multiple College employees to serve as \"committee experts\" one of whom will serve on each search committee to assist with recognizing bias, avoiding inappropriate topics, and more. Beginning in Fall 2019, new committee membership changed direction ; in its first year, the group focus on reading about diversity, holding committee discussions about diversit y, creating a calendar of observances , and exploring methods of communication among committee members a s well as the college community. During the 2019 -2020 academic year , the committee's activity was centered around its premier goal of establishing gender -neutral bathrooms in each campus building. That task was accomplished along with creating a map of which bathrooms had been designated for easy use by students and employees. The Committee's activities in 2020 -2021 are detailed below. In FY20, the Diversity Center morphed into the Unity Center whose activities are described below. AREAS OF EMPHASIS Covid -19: Like all colleges and universities, Allegany College of Maryland was forced to adapt all of its operations during the pandemic caused by the coronavirus. Early in the pandemic, the College chose to follow CDC guidelines , to comply with state mandates in both Maryland and Pennsylvania, and to partner closely with 26the lo cal public health departments in Allegany County and Bedford County. The College formed a Covid Command Team with representation across teaching and services to be the group responsible for overseeing the College's response, for mitigating exposure risk t o all, and for managing any reports of Covid -19 exposure, symptoms, and/or positive tests. The group read any official documents from federal, state, and local public health officials or experts on the pandemic response. These documents included guidance on how to ensure the institution did not engage in any discriminatory practices regarding the health , privacy, or disabilities of students, faculty, and staff while also promoting safe practice s. Examples of the many changes at Allegany College of Maryla nd include quickly creating multiple teaching methods to maximize remote learning where possible, coordinating with faculty to work with students whose absences were required by quarantine or isolation providing all necessary services with minimal on -campus personnel by utilizing technology for teleworking personnel, promoting self-care and using free mental health/support services which were expanded to include virtual sessions, adhering to guidance reg arding leniency with financial aid appeals for students whose academic performance was adversely affected by Covid , high risk activity waiver forms, and much more. Unfortunately, Covid -19 necessarily restricted most on-campus co-curricular and extra -curri cular opportunities for student s with limited recreational or personal enrichment programming possible; most of the College's non -academic activities were virtual this year by necessity. Unity Center After the opening in spring 2020, we had many students spending time in the Unity Center, meeting with friends, studying, playing games, etc. However, COVID obviously drastically changed that in March 2020. In the fall 2020 and Spring 2021, we maintained having two work study students in there, but obviously the center was not utilized as much with lower student traffic on campus. Pathways continues to use the Unity Center for Advising Sessions, and they are scheduled in the space weekly. They held many one -on-one Advising sessions in the Unity Center over th e last year due to it being a large space and offering Plexiglas barriers. They have also used it a handful of times for one -on-one Math tutoring. Prior to the COVID shut down, Richard Cofield held three programming events in there for Pathways students on the topics of financial literacy and academic success. Numerous faculty/staff groups have also used the Unity Center since it opened. The groups who regularly reserved and used the Unity Center over the last year were: AYM , Weight Watchers , Pathways for Success , Connections Tutoring , Disability and Access Resources Department , General Education Assessment , Business Department , Humanities Division , PBL, Student Emergency Support Committee , Financial Literacy Presentation , and Advoc ates for Christ . We also purchased two new laptops for student use in the center and a faculty laptop to use with the document camera and projector. We also just spent the remaining funds of our micro grants to add additional resources for programming f or the fall 2021 semester. Diversity , Equity, and Inclusion Committee : This year, the [renamed] Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Committee met bi -weekly on Zoom. The Committee continued to work on signage for all -gender, single -use restrooms on campus. The Committee worked in conjunction with various areas at ACM to get this signage and ensure that correct signage was visible on restroom locations and on campus maps. DEI also continued to work toward researching and providing culturally -responsive training for staff and faculty. (The staff member developing this training took a new job at another institution mid -year, so the training was not completed; DEI is working with Hum an Resources to identify a quality training from purchased resources.) The committee also held its first annual Scholarship Week, which was co -sponsored by Pathways for Success and Student Life. The goal of Scholarship Week was to raise awareness about scholarship opportunities at ACM as well as to provide resources and support to students, particularly those who are traditionally underrepresented among scholarship recipients. During Scholarship Week, students had the opportunity to view a tutorial demon strating how to complete ACM's online scholarship application 27recently created by the Advancement team , receive one-on-one instruction through the RAWC - either in- person or virtually - on writing effective scholarship essays , and participate in a virtual student -led Q & A session on how to successfully apply for scholarships . To present and gather information, DEI engaged in the following educational activities: developed a webpage on the ACM website for resources, student groups, reports, relevant policies, and more ; created and distributed a climate survey to students at the end of the spring semester that will help meet student needs in the fall and beyond ; presented the committee's work during Professional Development Day. Title IX: The Dean of Student & Legal Affairs is also the College's Title IX Coordinator and is thus charged with remaining current on legal/regulatory developments related to gender discrimination and properly addressing reports of discrimination regardless of gend er, sexual orientation, or sexual identity. The new Title IX regulations were issued in early May 2020; they contain a heavy emphasis on greater due process and elimination of bias. The College's Title IX policy was revised and new procedures/practices were developed in Spring/Summer 2020 to meet compliance. ADA/504: During FY20, Allegany College of Maryland was selected for a routine audit by the Maryland State Department of Education (MSDE ) Division of Career and College Readiness Methods of Administration (MOA). One significant outcome from the MOA was the re vision of the Dean of Student & Legal Affairs job description; that position is now designated as the College's ADA/504 Coordinator. Starting in summer 2020 and continuing throughout FY2 1, the Coordinator began developing institutional guidelines for ADA/504 compliance , identifying t he specifics of the Coordinator's role, conducting research, obtaining professional development including a course from the National Association of College an d University Attorneys, creating an Executive Summary, messaging students/faculty/staff, creating intake processes, adding content to the Student Affairs web page, crafting a comprehensive ADA/504 policy , crafting an Animals on Campus policy that includes service animals, finalizing procedures for support and service animals in on -campus housing, and forming an Advisory Team. All of these efforts relied upon the expertise and experience of the College's Di rector of Academic Access & Disability Resources whose office is charged with managing requests for academic accommodations. Discrimination: The Dean of Student & Legal Affairs is charged with remaining current on legal/regulatory developments related to other forms of discrimination and properly addressing reports of discrimination among students, faculty, or staff. The complaint form and process for responding to complaints is updated annually . (These documents were adapted from and align closely w ith corresponding Title IX documents.) The Dean also presents information about hate -bias to each student group with whom the Dean meets at the start of the academic year and in emails to students. Hate Crimes / Hate -Bias: See Part Five below. Lighthouse : The College contracted with third party vendor Lighthouse Services, Inc. to provide a venue for any person to report misconduct anonymously. Various College officials are designated as administrators and investigators for reports in the follo wing categories: discrimination, Title IX, safety/security, fraud, compliance/ethics, human resources, and athletics. The full rollout of this service was delayed by Covid -19 but was implemented in FY21. The Dean of Student & Legal Affairs receives any re ports discrimination, Title IX, and Athletics; no reports were received in FY21. First Amendment: The College revised and expanded its First Amendment Policy to a more accurately titled \" First Amendment Speech and Expression Policy\" . As a public institution with constitutional obligations which the College is honored to meet, Allegany College of Maryland's policy highlights that diversity of thought, speech, expression, and activities on campus are welcomed with minimal restrictions . The College invites and supports individuals and groups to exercise their First Amendment rights ; many of the programs and events included in Part Three below demonstrate this commitment. Additionally, the Dean of Student & Legal Affairs receives and approves campus event requests as well as ensures that 28spontaneous/unplanned events are not impeded within the reasonable time, place, and manner limits required of all expressive events. Both political and religious groups held successful events on the ma in campus this year. EVALUATION OF PROGRESS Allegany College of Maryland has continued a comprehensive review if its assessm ent and planning throughout FY 21; this review include d all areas of the College. A new Strategic Plan and Educational Master Plan went into effect, and the College has multiple layers of input and review of institutional assessment including new committees, internal processes (including budgetary , academic program review, and operation al unit review ), dedicated employee responsibilities, and even new positions charged with shouldering much of the assessment and planning work. Each unit submits an annual report to the Director of Institutional Effectiveness, Research, and Plannin g. Fu rthermore, each College committee submits an end of year report to the President's Advisory Team to reflect the committee's activities for the year, whether the committee should continue next year, and its plans if the work continues. Additionally, the St rategic Planning Council writes an annual report that addresses progress for each strategic initiative. ________________ ________________ ____________________________________________________________________ PART 2 A description of efforts to increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups among students, administrative staff and faculty - Detail initiatives designed to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented students, staff, and faculty. Both campus -wide and program specific DEMOGRAPHIC DATA / STUDENT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION The charts below highlight the race/ethnic ity in our local community and among our student body (5 years). Allegany County Race/Ethnicity Total Population 71445 White 65066 88.20% 2 or more races 6229 2.30% Hispanic 150 1.80% Black or African American Indian/Alaska Native 75 0.10% 9981 13.30% Source: 2019 Census Population 5 -year Estimates (ACS) Student racial/ethnic distribution Fall 2016 Fall 2017 Fall 2018 Fall 2019 Fall 2020 a.

Native of Maryland Accountability Report The majority of Allegany College of Maryland's underrepresented minority students reside in Willowbrook Woods, ACM's on campus housing facility which is described in Part IV. According to Institutional Research, 72% of Willowbrook Woods residents were minority in Fall 20 20 (for the Fall/Spring contract term) . A llegany College of Maryland offers on -campus apartments for up to 22 8 full time credit students of all socio -economic classes (largely low income and first -generation college students), races/ethnicities. geographic roots (mix of students from Maryland's metropolitan region and rural , multi - state locations), and college -preparedness (a significant number of residents take at least one developmental course and numerous residents are enrolled in highly competitive/demanding allied health programs). Due to Covid mitigation measures, occ upancy in Willowbrook Woods during 2020 -2021 was reduced to approximately 50% to allow each resident to have exclusive use of a bathroom and apartment hallway to reduce risk of transmission and to facilitate any necessary quarantine or isolation. Other Co vid changes in Residence Life this year were virtual programs which were all entertainment/coping focused rather than community -building or educational as in prior years which were often centered on diversity . Specific language f rom the Willowbrook Woods application emphasizes the importance of diversity : \"All students are expected to be full -time, degree -seeking students. Willowbrook Woods is a highly diverse living & learning community. Residents are selected based upon a variety of factors: overall q uality of application, academic program or major, timeliness of application, criminal and/or disciplinary record (if any), quality of interactions with staff members, and more. Allegany College of Maryland does not discriminate against students or prospect ive students for reasons of race, sex, color, religion, national/ethnic origin, age, veteran status, conditions of disability, or sexual orientation. Our commitment to fairness applies to applications, contracting, room assignments, programming, support, r ule enforcement, or any other aspect of residence life. \" The application packet was revised in 2020; it now focuses to a much greater degree on roommate compatibility. To ensure absolute fairness in the selection of residents, demographic data (except for age and gender) is not collected on the applicatio ns, and roommate assignments are made based upon information from the Roommate Matching Form which includes program/major and elicits particulars of compatibility such as interests, socializing tendenci es, study habits, noise, cleanliness, and smoking (ie., the issues which are the most frequent sources of roommate conflict). In order to be as inclusive as possible, Residence Life Staff asks these two questions on the Roommate Matching Form: 1. Gender Id entity choices : Male, Female, Trans or Transgender, Another Identity 2. Gender based room assignment choices : Male, Female, Gender Neutral Marketing/Recruitment: Traditionally, college recruitment staff attends multiple local and regional college and career fairs, with the goal of recruiting students, including underrepresented students. Campus tours are coordinated with high school counselors as well as families, both from rural and urban locations, with the goal of providing opportunities to recruit students from underrepresented backgrounds. Unfortunately, due to COVID -19, neither of these initiatives took place in FY2021. The ACM Recruitment staff was also unab le to 30attend programs or offer special events that support the recruitment of and services to underrepresented students due to COVID -19. Many traditional events and recruitment avenues to reach prospective students have been suspended since March 2020. The few opportunities to recruit and reach underrepresented minority students that were available in academic year 2020 -21 are: 1. Work Experience (WEX) program - Presentations to students enrolled in the WEX program. WEX is a job readiness program that focuses on building skills and developing the potential of parents receiving State assistance. (virtual) 2. Next Generation Scholars - The Next Generation Scholarship is a state grant program established by Maryland House Bill 1403 that provides funding for college a ccess through nonprofit organizations to enhance college and career awareness and college completion for low -income underserved Maryland high school students. The Next Generation Scholars program is available at Washington Middle and Fort Hill High Schools in Cumberland, Maryland. (virtual and in -person) 3. Naviance - a partnership was established with Hobsons to gain prospective student leads from areas in Maryland and Virginia with a more diverse population. As leads are received, follow up communications ar e sent to students. Additionally, important information is shared via the counselor community message board. 4. Adult Basic Education Display - Development of a display featuring Adult Basic Education was added to the Gateway Center's window display case to h elp encourage Maryland residents to finish earning their high school diploma or assistance with basic skills for employment. In addition, PR staff assisted with promotion of monthly virtual and in -person orientation sessions for students seeking their GED. Additionally, Allegany College of Maryland has a variety of programs and special projects that support the recruitment of and services to underrepresented students. A summary is provided below: 1. Pathways for Success is a TRIO Student Support Services pr oject to increase retention, graduation, and transfer rates of eligible students, as well as improve student grade point averages. The program provides a supportive environment on campus for underrepresented students with low -income or first-generation st atus and students with disabilities. The program offers tutoring in math, science, and writing/English, one -on-one academic advising, career advising, transfer advising, financial aid advising, peer mentoring, support groups, and workshops on topics such a s financial literacy. 2. Centralized Academic Advising in Rural Appalachia: Ensuring Student Success and Completion (a Title III program) enables the College to improve academic advising services to students, including underrepresented students, to boost their chances for success and will consolidate academic advising services in one location for greater access and more consistent delivery. This one -stop advising services center, located in the College Center, includes a wide range of academic advising, c areer planning, supportive counseling, educational coaching and mentoring services. 3. Consolidated Adult Education and Family Literacy Services offers a variety of programs and services to prepare underrepresented students for high school equivalency and lit eracy services for family and workforce development. Adults and out -of-school youth without a high school diploma have the option of completing secondary education through GED testing or the National External Diploma Program. Successful students by either approach are issued a Maryland high school diploma. Family literacy services, the second key part of adult education, help adults become literate for employment and self -sufficiency and enable them to become full partners in the educational development o f their children. Community outreach is a major emphasis, and the adult education program works with such agencies as the Human Resources Development Commission, Social Services of Allegany County, the YMCA Family Support Center and the local American Job Center. STAFF AND FACULTY RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION Human Resources' current efforts to recruit and retain traditionally underrepresented groups include the notice of nondiscrimination and the fact that we are an EEOC employer. HR sends job postings to Higher Ed Jobs with diversity boosts for faculty positions to help attract all potential candidates that read that publication, as well as using various online and social platforms such as Monster, Indeed, Glassdoor, and regional print publications. 31According to the most recent data available from Human Resources (FY 21), ACM had the following staffing percentages: Recruitment FY21 Data from 7/1/2020 - 5/13/2021 Applicants % Applied Hired Hired TOTAL Applicants 279 22 Male 118 42% 11 50% Female 136 49% 11 50% Non -disclosed 25 9% American Indian 1 0% 0% Asian 16 0% 6% 0% Hispanic/Latino 3% 0% Two or White 208 75% 22 100% Undisclosed 25 9% 0% Veteran 15 5% 2 9% Not a Veteran 242 87% 19 86% Not disclosed 22 8% 0% Disabled 21 8% 1 5% Not Disabled 219 78% 18 82% Not Disclosed 39 14% 0% Retention From EDS report FY2021 FT Faculty Minority 2.15% FT Faculty non -white 1.08% FT Faculty & Staff/Minority 2.12% FT Faculty & Staff/Non -white 1.41% PT Faculty & Staff Minority 5.91% PT Faculty & Staff Non -white 4.30% Payroll ending 11/15 FT and PT Staff FT 283 PT 186 TOTAL 469 White, Hispanic 5 Non -white 12 Non -white 2.56% 32Minority 3.62% According to the most recent data available from Institutional Effectiveness, Research, and Planning (FY21), ACM had the following staffing percentages: Fall 2016 Fall 2017 Fall 2018 Fall 2019 Fall 2020 Percent Minority Full -Time Faculty 1.90% 2.00% 3.00% 3.20% 2.20% 0.90% 1.30% 1.80% 1.80% 1.00% Percent of Employees Responding Strongly Agree or Agree: 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 The College demonstrates commitment valuing diversity 82% 79% 81% 84% Source: ACM Employee -2020 The President and Director of Institutiona l Effectiveness, Research , and Planning conducted the annual internal Employee Satisfaction Survey in Fall 20 20 as well as the Chronicle of Higher Education's survey in the hopes of achieving that publication's designation as a Great College to Work For to enhance recruitment and retention . The results remain encouraging and show steady progress at the institution. For both retention and teaching excellence , faculty has updated and implemented its peer mentor program which is now mandatory for new facu lty; that process has been reviewed and improved extensively by the Educational Innovations Committee and the subcommittee working group led by Associate Professor Robin Seddon . Additionally, all faculty who teach online or blended classes are required to complete a new self - paced online course, Accessibility and Your Online Course , as well as comply with a new eCourse policy for quality assurance including accessibility standards. Search Committee Experts HR continues to train and use a team of search committee experts. The training these individuals receive allows them to recognize common recruiting biases, avoid inappropriate topics, to read congruency between candidates' words / expressions / body language, and to point these factors out to other peo ple on their search committees that they have been assigned to . Every search committee is required to have one of these individuals on the committee. These changes were made to enhance this aspect of our institution to help ensure that we hire the best ca ndidates possible for open positions, while also assuring that we maintain non - discriminatory hiring practices. ________________ ________________ ____________________________________________________________________ PART 3 A description of efforts designed to create positive interactions and cultural awareness among students, faculty and staff on campus. - Faculty and staff cultural training programs - Curricular initiatives that promote cultural diversity in the classroom - Co-curricular programming for students Faculty and staff All new, full time Faculty, and all Professional and Associate Support Staff are required to complete harassment training which includes sexual harassment. Additionally, pursuant to the regulations in place during FY2 1, every new ACM emp loyee is required to receive Title IX training during his/her first year of employment. The Title IX Coordinator provided updated information regarding the new regulations to all employees via messaging and webpage documents. 33 Curricular Initiatives The Nursing Program (Karisa White, Instructor) developed new simulations for learning that focus on how to treat and support transgendered patients. Two scenarios were adopted within the nursing curriculum. The first scenario involved a male transgender patient having breast tenderness, redness, and discharge. Patient comes to the Emergency Department to be seen and the Mammogram and Ultrasound show that the patient has breast cancer and recommend follow up with oncology and a breast spe cialist. In this scenario the student will not be directly told that the patient is a transgender but after looking at the diagnostic test results they will need to identify that the patient is a transgender and use therapeutic communication in order to as k some hard or difficult assessment questions. The second scenario involves a female transgender patient having trouble starting the urine stream, frequency, and nocturia. The patient comes to the Emergency Department for lower abdominal pain and has an ab dominal Cat Scan showing an enlarged prostate. For this situation the student will need to use therapeutic communication to explain to the patient and her husband what is happening and how to treat prostate issue. They will also have to identify signs and symptoms of prostate cancer and be able to educate their patient in regards to what they should be monitoring for. General Education Personal & Civic Responsibility Goal: Faculty are designated each year to list personal and civic responsibility as a lear ning outcome for students. Faculty participate in trainings that foster shared understanding of the goal, expectations for proficiency, and t eaching and learning strategies . Co-Curricular Programming Aspiring Young Mentors (AYM) : Our mission remains the same -to improve the GPA and retention rates of underserved students. Fall 2020 - Chandler Sagal, Ashley Dively, and the AYM Student Mentors developed a series titled \"Mentor Mondays.\" Every Monday at 12, we had a guest speaker lead a session that was ope n to ANY and ALL students at ACM. The topics/presenters were: Motiv ation/Goal Setting (11 students), Mind -Body Skills (8 students) , Coping with Anxiety and Stress Relieving Strategies (7 students) , Navigating COVID as a student (9 students) , Food insecurit y and resources for students (10 students) , On Course, Using Creator Language (5 students) , Dress for Success for Job Interviews (11 students) , Motivation and Perseverance (9 students) . Mind -Body Skills (9 students) , and Current/ Previous Mentors -End of Sem ester Celebration (11 students) . From the 10 original mentors that started this program in Spring 2019, 6 graduated with Associate's Degrees from ACM. From those 6 graduates: two just graduated from Towson University with Bachelor's Degrees; one is finish ing year three at UMBC; One is finishing year three at ACM in a 3+1 program. Of the 6 graduates from ACM, their GPAs were 3.42, 3.3, 2.89, 2.81, 2.79, and 2.70, well above the average GPA for African American males at ACM. It should be noted that 9 of the se 10 original mentors started in Developmental Education courses at ACM (four started in the 90 -level courses!). 6 of the 10 were/are Pathways for Success students as well. Current mentors include three males and two females who we hope will help to build our program this fall.

Allegany College of Maryland collects data annually from the following reporting sources : Campus Security / Public Saf ety Cumberland City Police Pennsylvania State Police (Bedford County) Student & Legal Affairs (Cumberland campus) Student Services Director ( Bedford campus) The hate crimes data which must be collected includes murder/non -negligent manslaughter, negligent manslaughter, sex offenses (forcible), sex offenses (non -forcible), robbery, aggravated assault, motor vehicle theft, arson, any crime involving bodily injur y, larceny/theft, simple assault, intimidation, and vandalism/destruction of property. The Violence Against Women Act added the following additional crimes and hate crimes: domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. The reports must specify the w hether the hate crime targeted by race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, disability, or ethnicity/national origin; by federal law, gender identity has been added as a new hate crime category. Crimes also note the location of the crime (ie., on campus , student housing, non -campus, or [adjacent] public property). This data is compiled and submitted electronically to the U.S . Department of Education by October each year . The written report containing both statistics and narrative content is completed each summer, published, and posted online; all students and all employees are notified electronically twice per year. No hate crimes were reported in FY21. NOTE: the [2006] Code of Student Conduct was revised in FY21 (formally approved in August 2020); the revision added a new section provision for hate crimes and hate -bias incidents committed by students. VII.E. Hate - Bias 1. Hate Crime: an offense that manifests evidence that the victim was intentionally selected because of the perpetrator's bias against the victim on the basis of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, ethnicity, national origin, or disability. 2. Hate -Bias Incident: a hostile act of conduct, speech, or exp ression motivated in whole or in part by intolerance, bias, or prejudice against another. Unlike a hate crime, the hostile act is not a criminal act; like a hate crime, the hostile act is motivated by prejudice. 38Maryl and Higher Education Commission (MHEC) Cultural Diversity Report 2021 A description of how the institution defines diversity (no more than one page); how did the institution develop that definition (e.g., processes, sources, and guidance used)? Anne Arundel Community College (AACC) is committed to fostering, cultivating , sustaining and embedding the goals and values of diversity and inclusion. Since 2015, AACC has intentionally centered equity as a priority in two transformative strategic plans that continue to focus the college on dismantling barriers for students of color. AACC adopted the following diversity statement in 2016: AACC is committed to supporting and sustaining a diverse and inclusive educational environment. Diversity is not merely a goal but a value that is embedded throughout the institution in multiple areas including (but not limited to): learning, teaching, student development, institutional functioning, and engagement in partnerships with the local and global community. AACC recognizes that proactive steps are necessary to ensure equality of outcomes. The college has a comprehensive Diversity Plan that is managed by the Committee on Diversity and is reviewed annually; this plan has led to significant institutional changes including professional development opportunities. This past year, a working group comprised of the Associate Vice President for Learning and Academic Affairs, the Coordinator for Inclusive Excellence, the Director of the Center for Faculty and Staff Development and a psychology professor, who is a leader at the college in diversity, equity and inclusion work, developed a racial equity vocabulary list. This group collaboratively researche d, vetted, and formed a comprehensive glossary of equity, diversity, inclusion and antiracism terms, which was adopted by the college. The terms were captured from national and regional organizations, such as the American Association for Colleges & Universities, Racial Equity Tools, the Center for the Study of Social Policy, and Achieving the Dream. In this glossary, the definition for diversity: diversity includes all the ways in which people differ, and it encompasses all the different characteristics that make one individual or group different from another. It is all-inclusive and recognizes everyone and every group as part of the diversity that should be valued. A broad definition includes not only race, ethnicity, and gender \u2014 the groups that most often come to mind when the term \"diversity\" is used \u2014 but also age, national origin, religion, disability, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, education, marital status, language, and physical appearance. It also involves different ideas, perspectives, and values. The Board of Trustees also revised its comprehensive equity, diversity and inclusion policy in February 2021 to include antiracism and definitions from this glossary, and to affirm the College's support for efforts to promote antiracism and achieve diversity, equity and inclusion for our student s, faculty and staff. 39A brie f (no more than one page) highlight of the most successful ongoing and new institutional initiatives designed to address issues related to cultural diversity within the campus and the broader community, and how their efficacy is measured . One of the most successful ongoing institutional initiatives at AACC is Model Courses. Model Courses is a two-year, cohort -style, intensive program for faculty teaching high -enrollment, low-performing courses across disciplines. The cohort consists of an estimated 30 faculty/instructors each year, facilitated by trained Faculty Mentors . Model Courses ensures that course instruction aligns with course outcomes and contributes to program outcomes; ensures that the course instruction incorporates culturally responsive teaching, student - focused teaching and addresses the needs of equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI); and uses assessment to inform future decisions for the course design and delivery. Specifically, for EDI, model courses promote intercultural relations and cultural competency in order to sustain an inclusive learning and working environment ; develop student centered climates and practices that foster inclusive excellence, remo ve barriers, and increase access and accountability in equitable practices ; cultivate an EDI lens regarding curriculum and pedagogy, encouraging instructors to think about power /privilege relations consistently throughout the content and methods used in th eir course ; and c reate flexible teaching spaces and practices that allow instructors to respond to the unique characteristics of different groups of students and encourage teaching practices that use the lived experiences of students as an asset in the cou rse. The testimonials of faculty participating in Model Courses include an increased awareness of EDI, seeing the connection of EDI and student success, and positive responses from students. The outcomes of Model Courses indicate the needle is moving to narrow the equity gap (Fall 2019 to Spring 2020): For new institutional initiatives, t his past year, AACC was honored to be selected as one of the 10 colleges for the Achieving the Dream and University of Southern California (USC) Race and Equity Cente r Racial Equity Leadership Academy. The team from AACC, which includes the president, vice presidents, and EDI leadership on campus, will participate in racial equity focused modules, identify a racial equity change effort to implement, have access to reso urces and tools on racial equity, engage in honest dialogue about racial topics, and develop a long -range vision that will guide the college's racial equity change effort. The work for the Racial Equity Leadership Academy starts July 2021, and the overall expected outcomes are to increase student success and completion through an intentional design to eliminate structural barriers to equity. 40A brie f (no more than one page) discussion of the ways in which the institution anticipates COVID- 19 most affecting - either negatively or positively - its efforts to enhance diversity on its campus or campuses. This may include, for example, acknowledgement of issues such as disproportionate impacts on retention and graduation among certain populations; the shift to distance education modalities limiting the ability to provide in -person programming; or, in contrast, the shift to online education providing opportunity for more students to access diversity programming. While COVID -19 continues to change the landscape of higher education, equity remains a priority focus. AACC is addressing the immediate challenges its students are facing related to digital and societal divides that have only been magnified during these challenging times. AACC provides technology (laptops, hotspots, etc.) for students, who may not have access. Programs, such as AACC's Food Pantry, are offered remotely, through delivery of nonperishable, shelf- stable items . AACC's financial aid officers help students navigate through social and community services. Students dealing with academic and personal challenges may receive support through the college's Health and Personal Counseling Services. In May 2020, over 400 facul ty participated in the college's eLearner Success Institute, which is built upon Q-CAR standards for Inclusiveness and Equity in online teaching and learning. Further, over 150 faculty have been awarded Resiliency Grants to improve equity gaps in course ou tcomes. To further support student success, AACC embedded tutors into online courses in fall 2020, including hundreds of English and Math sections. Knowing that COVID -19 has taken its toll on nearly all higher education institutions, which are contending with challenges around reopening plans, course modalities, enrollment declines, student success rates, financial constraints, and more, AACC's Office of Planning, Research, and Institutional Assessment addressed the following research question: m easured by course success rates, how did AACC's students perform in Fall 2020 compared to pre -COVID Fall 2019? Overall, the course success rate was almost the same for all students in Fall 2020 (72.8%) compared the Fall 2019 (72.9%). When disaggregating the data for white and nonwhite, online course success rate s slightly increased for nonwhite students from 65.7% in Fall 2019 to 66.4% in Fall 2020, and the online course success rate s increased for white students as well, from 73.2% to 75.8%. While the gap still exists, the course success rates achieved by students in Fall 2020 showcase the strength, resilience, and excellence of the college's faculty, staff and students, and the quality of online education and support services AACC provides to its students. 41Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Plan 2018- 2027 Anne Aru ndel Community College (AACC) is committed to fostering, cultivating and sustaining its culture of diversity and inclusion. Human capital is our most valuable asset. Individual differences, life experiences, knowledge, inventiveness, innovation, self -expression, unique capabilities and talent of our employees support and enhance our culture , reputation and achievements. Thus we welcome, accept and embrace employees and students with all their differences; it is what makes us who we are. The Equi ty, Diversity and Inclusion Plan (EDI Plan) targets making equity, diversity, inclusion and fairness visible and audible within AACC . By asking whether, how, why, and to what degree, the distribution of oppor tunities, conditions, practices, and achievement outcomes for certain groups are persistently and systematically different from other groups. The EDI Plan is intended to identify activities to help achieve the goal s and objective s set forth in the college strategic plan, Engagement Matters: Pathways to Completion, and addressing systems to produce fairness. This EDI Plan lays out a vision for equ ity, diversity and inclusion through specific strategies and desired outcomes for the next ten years.

The plan must include a description of the way the College addresses cultural diversity among the campus community, to include students, faculty, and staff; how the College plans to enhance cultural diversity; a process for reporting campus - based hate crimes; and a summary of any resources, including State grants, needed by the College to effectively recruit and retain a culturally diverse student body. MHEC prov ides a memo annually detailing what needs to be included in the report. The report requirements for this year were very different from previous years. Due to the pandemic , and most institutions having to operate remotely duri ng the 2020 -2021 academic year, the report has been reduced to no more than three pages in length . The required sections of the report are as follows: A description of how the institution defines diversity and how the definition was developed. A brief highlight of the most successful ongoing or new initiatives designed to address issues related to cultural diversity on campus. A brief discussion of the ways in which the institution anticipates COVID -19 most affected -either negatively or positively -it's efforts to enhance di versity on its campus. The institutional definition for Diversity was garnered from our Core Values definition. The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion committee developed five (5) goals to guide the Diversity Plan and the goals were approved by the BOT in t he last reporting period. The goals are as follows: Goal 1: To cultivate and sustain a diverse and multicultural student body that is reflective of the global community by recruiting, retaining, and graduating ethnic minority students that are under -repres ented in higher education. Goal 2 : To integrate the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion into all aspects of college life. Goal 3 : To identify impediments to creating a diverse and inclusive environment, propose solutions to overcome those impedi ments, and measure progress at all levels of the College. Goal 4 : To ensure a variety of channels are utilized to attract and retain a diverse, qualified, and competitive applicant pool of faculty and staff. Goal 5 : To provide a supportive and nurturing le arning environment to prepare students to collaborate with diverse communities in a culturally sensitive manner. Events and activities highlighted in the report have been grouped under the associated goal. The final section of the report details the impact o f COVID -19 and highlights the creative ways the College pivoted to increase support for students, faculty, and staff while operating remotely. Areas of concern noted in the report were the declines in student enrollment, which most institutions exp erienced , and the need for a multi -year diversity plan diminished the College's ability to track and measure efficacy.

This definition was developed as part of the 2018 -2022 Strategic Plan, which had College -wide participation and was approved by BCCC's Board of Trustees. As a Core Value, diversity is integrated in many facets of student programming and employee professional development . In addition, t he College's vision speaks to the importance of providing quality education for a diverse population of students . Strategic Plan Goal 1, student success, speaks to providing equitable access to a learning environment that supports a diverse population of learners. BCCC is currently in the process of developing an updated Strategic Plan with the assistance of the consulting fir m Keeling and Associates. BCCC's commitment to diversity is r eflected in the many activities, events, co -curricular programming, and professional development opportunities provided to all members of the BCCC community. Prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, much of the coordination and programming efforts were facilitated and monitored by the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Committee. The committee's strategic goals from the 2020 -2021 Cultural Diversity Plan are noted bel ow (see appendix) . Goal 1: To cultivate and sustain a diverse and multicultural student body that is reflective of the global community by recruiting, retaining, and graduating ethnic minority students that are under -represented in higher education. Goal 2: To integrate the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion into all aspects of college life. Goal 3: To identify impediments to creating a diverse and inclusive environment, propose solutions to overcome those impediments, and measure progress at al l levels of the College. Goal 4: To ensure a variety of channels are utilized to attract and retain a diverse, qualified, and competitive applicant pool of faculty and staff. Goal 5: To provide a supportive and nurturing learning environment to prepare students to collaborate with dive rse communities in a culturally sensitive manner. The committee has been operationalized and integrated into the respective Cabinet areas led by the Vice President (VP) of Student Affairs with the VP of Institutional Effectiveness, Research & Planning, Chief Internal Auditor, VP of Workforce Development & Continuing Education, Interim VP of Finance & Administration . This group will guide the development of future diversity goals , forms of assessment , and targets to align with the College 's strategic plan. Institutional Activities Due to the pandemic, s everal engagemen t activities were held remotely for students and the community in academic year 2020-2021, including those noted below. Futur e events will include participant survey s. Goal One Immigration Law and Know Your Rights - The forum, held by the Latinx Uni2 Student Club , included a pre sentation by the Esperanza Center Immigration Legal Services on immigrants/ rights . (September 2020 , 22 participants ) Let's Talk Justice: Reflections on the Verdict of the Trial of Derek Chauvin - Student Life and Engagement (SLE) , Student Support and Wellness Services , and Student Government Association (SGA) facilitated a discussion on race, crime, and justice, focusing on the verdict of the Derek Chauvin trial and its impact on America. (April 2021, 25 participants) Goal Two Let's Talk Education - As part of American Education Week, the Anthropology & Sociology Club (ASC) , History Club, Education/Special Education program, General Studies program, and S LE 57sponsored a panel of professional educators who discussed \"Reflections on Ethnicity, Gender and Special Education in the age of a Pande mic.\" (November 2020 , 39 participants ) Kwanzaa with Charles Dugger - The S GA, ASC, History Club and SLE attended the virtual Kwanzaa program at the Enoch Pratt Librar y. (December 2020 , 25 participants ) Goal Three Love of Language - SLE and SGA sponsored this event in appreciation of language . Staff, students , and special guests gave lessons in informal Spanish , sign language , and French . The International Student Services Coordinator and Club Advisor presented Russian. (February 2021 , 20 par ticipants ) Keeping It Real Lecture - \"Black Women's Vital Role in the Civil Rights Movement\" - BCCC History Professor and author Baba Zak A. Kondo presented the event spon sored by th e ASC, Dept. of Education, Social & Behavior al Sciences , History Club, and S LE. (March 2021, 83 participants) History of the League of Women Voters of Baltimore City - Sponsored by t he History Club, A SC, SLE, SGA and League of Women Voters of Baltimore City , BCCC alum and League member Sally Grant presented and answered questions. (March 2021, 49 participants) Goal Four Over 100 faculty and staff participated in various sessions a s part of institutional professional development day s held the week before the start of the Spring 2021 semester. Mandatory t raining was held related to sexual assault in the workplace . For faculty , additional sessions were held related to various instructional technologies for remote learning environment s. A survey of participants ( 42 respondents ) showed that 95.2% agreed that the mandatory sexual assault session was beneficial. Goal Five Geography Bee - The Admissions Office, I nternational Students Club, SGA and SLE held th is kick -off for International Education Month and tested attendees' knowledge of countries represented in the BCCC community. (November 2020 , 10 participants ) Monticello Black History Month Events - The History Club and SGA attended virtual events sponsored by Thomas Jefferson's Monticello (Monticello.org) , (February 2021 , 25 participants ) COVID -19 Impact In March 2020, BCCC transition ed to remote operations, due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Th erefore, learning and servicing students had to shift to virtual delivery methods (Goal 5). All in-person classes transitioned to a virtual format for the remainder of the semester at the scheduled class times via Zoom or other platform s. Utilizing the Canvas learning management system, a compan ion to classroom learning , became more integral for students and faculty to communicate and track assignme nts. As it became clear that not all student s had WIFI and /or access to a computer at home , the College provided laptops to credit and non -credit students as needs were identified and partnered with Comcast to provide low -cost internet service (Goal 3). BCCC 's bookstore provided and shipped over 2, 100 textbook s in Summer 2020 at no cost to the students . Technical challenges remained with the remote environment includ ing weak or intermittent internet signals causing \"lagging\", audio or video cut -out, screens freezing, and buffering. BCCC's Information Technology Services expanded hours to support the College community (Goal 5). As the pandemic continued, BCCC launched t he #BCCCStrong campaign to help the students, staff, and community feel connected. BCCC expanded virtual services and events for students and the community . The Virtual Helpdesk was created to serve as a single resource to access most student service needs . Events, activities , and co -curricular programming were conducted via Zoom (Goals 1, 4, and 5 ). Space constraints were no longer barriers as attendees were able to access the event s from their home s. Events that were costly because of foo d and other costs, became l ow- to no -cost. However, the in -person interaction which typically happens during on -campus events and activities is largely lost. While there are icebreakers or question/answer s essions, there is typically little to no informal interaction available. College faculty and staff have heard from some students that they are experiencing COVID -19 fatigue 58and miss in -person learning and activities . Safety remains BCCC 's top priority; when the campus reopens, both in -person and remote instruction, and extra - and co-curricular programs will continue. BCCC 's zip code , 21215 , has consistently had the highest COVID -19 positivity rate in the City. To better serve its community , BCCC partner ed with CVS as a site for free COVID testing . As Maryland moved into Phase 1B of its vaccination plan , BCCC became a site for the Baltimore City Health Department . BCCC experienced an enrollment decline in fall 2020, as did most of Maryland's colleges and univer sities largely due to the pandemic. While the College's credit student enrollment decreased by 14.8% from fall 2019 to fall 2020, the proportions of students by race/ethnicity remained stable, as reflected in the table below . To better accommodate students, BCCC implemented new 14 - and 10 -week sessions in fall 2020 which continued in spring 2020. (Goal 2) Similarly, the number of full -time faculty and staff decreased by 9.0% from fall 2019 to fall 2020, the proportions by race/ethnicity remained stable (1.6% and 1.5% for Hispanic , respectively) (Goal 4). BCCC administers the Community College Survey of Student Engagement (CCSSE) to on -campus credit students, in class, every two years in the Spring semester. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the CCSSE was administered online for the first time in spring 2020 with 153 valid respondents. A few items related to COVID -19 were included. Characteristics of the CCSSE respondents include the following . Prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, 40.5% had not taken online classes at BCCC and 52.7% had not taken any hybrid classes at BCCC. 16.2% indicated that English is not their native (first) language. 87.8% indicated that they would recommend BCCC to a friend or family member. 16.2% indicated that they are an international student or non -resident alien. 5.2% indicated they are \"Hispanic or Latino\". 35.9% indicated that they are first -generation college students. Responses related to the question \"How much does the college emphasize the following?\" are noted below. The options were: very little, some, quite a bit, or very much. \"Encouraging contact among students from different economic, social, and racial or ethnic backgrounds\" - 69.6% responded \"Quite a bit\" or \"Very much\". the you to 63.2% responded \"Quite a bit\" or \"Very much\". Conclusion As BCCC proceeds in its strategic planning process, all areas will be engaged in aligning all component institutional plans to include the diversity and equal opportunity goals and objectives. Lessons learned from the transition to a remote learning and student services environment led to greater communication and collaborations.

Inclusion - the act of taking in or comprising as a part of a whole or group BCCC's P lan to Improve Cultural Diversity Strategic Goals This Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Plan incorporates transformational change at the College. The goals are: Goal One: To cultivate and sustain a diverse and multicultural student body that is reflective of the global community by recruiting, retaining, and graduating ethnic minority students that are under-represented in higher education. Goal Two: To integrate the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion into all aspects of College life. Goal Three: To identify impediments to creating a diverse and inclusive environment, propose solutions to overcome those impediments, and measure progress at all levels of the College. Goal Four: To ensure a variety of channels are utilized to attract and retain a diverse, qualified, and competitive applicant pool of faculty and staff.

The DEI committee, in conjunction with the President's Cabinet will monitor these goals . The committee is comprised of broad representation spanning each of the divisions across the College. In FY 2020, the DEI Committee will meet regularly to monitor the progress of the strategic diversity goals of the College. Transforming the College is a shared responsibility . Accountability measures will be developed by the committee charged with overseeing the plan's implementation. Achievements in Diversity The majority of the College's executive leadership team has been in place for less than a year at this writing- the President, the Vice President of Academic Affairs, the Vice President of Student Affairs, the General Counsel and the Vice President, Institutional Effectiveness, Research and Planning, and the Mayor's Scholar's Program Director. The Vice Presidents of Workforce Development and Continuing Education and Advancement and Strategic Partnerships are the only executive leadership team members who have been at the College more than a year. It is important to note the breadth and the depth of diversity represents a span of race, ethnicity, gender, and age. Over the past five years, BCCC has experienced changes in enrollment and increased diversity. Two of the subpopulations that the College has witnessed an increase in growth has been with dual enrollment and LatinX students. There has been a steady growth among LatinX students. Students In addition to tracking enrollment trends based on ethnic background as provided in Chart 1, the Office of Institutional Research (OIR) develops retention data based on various student characteristics including ethnic background, gender, age, Pell status, developmental need, full- or part-time enrollment status, and distance education status. Similar measures are included in the annual Performance Accountability Report OIR prepares and submits to MHEC annually. As tables 2 and 3 reflect, the numbers and proportions of Hispanic (LatinX) students have increased since Fall 2013 . 63Table 2: BCCC Fall 2013 - Fall 2019 Credit Student Enrollment Counts by Ethnic Background Table 3: BCCC Fall 2013 - Fall 2019 Credit Hispanic Student Enrollment OIR administers the Community College Survey of Student Engagement (CCSSE) to on-campus credit students, in class, every two years in the Spring semester. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CCSSE was administered online for the first time. The Spring 2020 administration had 231 respondents. The results will be provided later this year by the Center for Community College Student Engagement. Highlights from the spring 2018 results (379 respondents) are provided below.

In terms of the characteristics of the respondents, distributions are similar to the general population of credit students for gender and age. 69.2% of the general population are female compared to 76.0% of the survey respondents. 40.3% of the general population are 30 years of age or more compared to 34.6% of the respondents. There are differences in terms of attendance status (full-time versus part-time) and ethnic background as noted below. 32.2% of the general population are enrolled full-time versus 61.5% of the respondents. 80.7% of the general population are African American compared to 75.0% of the respondents; 8.2% of the general population are White compared to 17.3% of the respondents; and 4.2% indicated that they are Hispanic or Latino (only or multi-race) compared to 5.0% of the general population. The results indicate that students feel valued and that faculty and staff are concerned about their welfare. The items for this sectio n of the survey were modified from the prior years' versions and are noted as such when referencing results. 84.6% of respondents strongly agree or agree with the statement \"I feel valued in the classroom/learning environment.\" A noteworthy improvement from the spring 2016 administration to the fall 2017 administration was the increase from 75.0% to 89.8% of respondents indicating their agreement with the statement \"BCCC employees are genuinely concerned about the welfare of students.\" In spring 2020, the statement was broken into two categories with the following results. o 83.0% strongly agree or agree with the statement \"I think faculty are genuinely concerned about the welfare of students\". o 62.5% strongly agree or agree with the statement \"I think administrators are genuinely concerned about my welfare.\" 76.5% of respondents agreed that \"I am happy to be at this college\". (New item) Through these efforts, BCCC demonstrated an increase in successful enrollment and retention of students from all backgrounds, including first-generation students and populations of students historically underrepresented at the College. Efforts to Increase Representation of Traditionally Underrepresented Groups Students Over the past five years, BCCC has experienced changes in enrollment across the aforementioned subpopulations. While there has been a decrease in students who have identified as veterans or military, the College has witnessed progressive and steady growth among LatinX students. The following describes specific initiatives and strategies BCCC has integrated to improve student enrollment that has a focus on diversity and inclusion. LatinX LatinX college students are the fastest growing population in the United States. However, when compared to other ethnicities, educational attainment for this group falls short. BCCC, like many other institutions in the country, has created focused efforts to target this special population to support degree attainment and to further educational opportunities. LatinX students may include, but are not limited to: Hispanic students, students who disclose/self-report that they are members of the LatinX community, students who qualify for DACA, members of communities that identify as Spanish speaking, Dreamers, ESOL, and students who need English Language services. The percentage of the Hispanic /Latino population at Baltimore City Public Schools is 13.5% for 2019/2020 school year. Veterans and Military Students BCCC supports veterans, service members, and military families by offering educational opportunities for them to continuously enhance their existing skillsets. This subpopulation of students includes active duty, National Guard, Reservists, Veterans (prior military service), dependents spouses or children, and survivors. BCCC supports veterans and military personnel enrolled at the institution with several initiatives, such as a dedicated Veteran certifying official on campus, one- on-one assistance, counseling services through Student Support and Wellness, and dedicated priority registration. International Students More than 85 countries are represented at BCCC among students, faculty, and staff. The College assesses the needs of international 65students, providing thorough information on immigration regulations and procedures to advise international students effectively, orient students to the policies and expectations of the institution, its culture, and the U.S. educational system. On an ann ual basis, BCCC sponsors workshops on travel, graduation and transfer, employment, and New International Student Orientation. In the fall of 2019, the College established membership in the Maryland International Education Consortium to increase the college's international presence and to better maximize the resources of partnering with the consortium. This membership helps to increase the institution's exposure to international communities. BCCC also engages this subpopulation of students by hosting weekly club meetings and co-sponsoring cultural activities for students. The Mayor's Scholars Program This program has demonstrated its impact on FTEs, significantly increasing the number of first time, full time students, almost entirely from Baltimore City Public Schools. The enrollment target of 250 students has been exceeded for the past two years. Retention for MSP (Fall- to-Fall 43%) has surpassed rate for the College's Pell-eligible and developmental student populations. Experience with Cohorts I and II has allowed the institution to identify and address challenges and pilot new programs. Looking forward, MSP will continue to serve as an important conduit for BCCC recruitment and student success. Partnering with Baltimore City's Mayor's Office, Baltimore City Public Schools, and organizations such as YouthWorks, We are CASA and the CollegeBound Foundation will help to secure BCCC's position as Baltimore areas community college of choice. The new administration is committed to strengthening the program as BCCC continues on a path to achieve its full potential. The Mayor's Scholars Program (MSP) has been an exemplary program, advancing the College's dedication to an inclusive educational experience. From its inception, it has been structured to meet the College's strategic goal to increase diversity of the student population and meet the diverse needs of this population. The program was created in coordination with the Mayor's Office of Baltimore City, to guarantee a free college education to all graduating high school seniors from Baltimore City Public Schools. The College has done the following through the program: Partnered with a local immigrant rights group, We Are CASA, which helped cover student expenses during the summer bridge program. This assistance aided some undocumented students who could not file the traditional FAFSA application. Maintaining bilingual recruiters (Spanish-speaking) to work with students and families in both English and Spanish, also bilingual in Spanish. All three bilingual staff would reach out to students in high school during the application process in the spring semesters. Held Spanish-language information and orientation sessions at off-site locations convenient to the LatinX community. Had bilingual staff work with students attending ESL classes. Spanish-language interpreters were assigned. Provided Kosher food for Jewish youth leaders participating in the summer bridge program. Selected Summer Bridge Student Ambassadors representative of the diversity of students- along racial, ethnic, gender, religious, and multilingual lines. The ambassadors, chosen from among cohort 1 students, mentored cohort 2 students with advising, orientation and college resources. Administrative Staff and Faculty The Office of Human Resources is dedicated to maintaining strategic partnerships with College leaders to attract, develop, and retain a qualified and diverse workforce that fosters an environment to support our students, mission, and vision. Services are provided in the areas of Recruitment/Talent Acquisition, Benefits, Classification and Compensation, Professional Development and Training, and Labor Relations.

This 66applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including recruitment, hiring, promotions, transfers, reassignments, training, career development, benefits and separation. To deter overt discrimination, Human Resources will help faculty and staff to become aware of and to recognize more covert and subtle forms of discrimination through educational programs and remove institutional barriers to equality. All members of the college community are expected to abide by Non-Discrimination Policy, city, State and federal requirements. Persons charged with a violation of this policy, if substantiated, may be subject to disciplinary action, including discharge, in addition to the penalties imposed under State and federal law. Efforts Designed to Create Positive Interactions and Cultural Awareness Students The student body of BCCC play a large role in the efforts to provide cultural diversity within the College.

Curricular Initiatives In addition to some of the activities noted above, some of the curricular initiatives that BCCC has adopted to promote cultural diversity in the classroom takes place in a course that all students are required to take as a part of every curriculum. Preparation for Academic Achievement (Pre-100) is designed to provide all first-year, full and part-time degree and/or certificate-seeking students with an introduction to student and academic services offered at BCCC . The course incorporates a module on diversity and accessibility. The module largely covers students and faculty interactions in terms of cultural equity and sensitivity. Another particularly noteworthy program is Nursing. Within cultural awareness and sensitivity is embedded withi n and throughout the program. This concept is specifically addressed in the Nursing Fundamentals course. Administrative Staff and Faculty During the Spring and Summer semesters of 2019, BCCC offered numerous sessions of Safe Spaces training to all faculty and staff. This engagement was extremely well attended, with a robust, interactive crowd. Safe Spaces will ensure that employees are sensitive to all the nuances in our culture today as it relates to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, Intersex and Asexual (LGBTQIA) communities. BCCC's Office of Human Resources regularly sponsors Safe Spaces workshops for faculty and staff. The sessions are designed to be both interactive and informational. Faculty and administrative staff learn to better identify and avoid macroaggressions and other intentional or unintentional speech or actions. One of the objectives of this training is to have faculty and staff leave with and apply a greater sense of cultural competence. Increasing the Diversity of Faculty and Staff The most successful proven strategy for increasing diversity of faculty and staff of the campus has been the integration of purposeful improvements within Human Resources. Diversity and inclusion is integrated throughout the infrastructure of Human Resources from the posting of job announcements to hiring and professional development. Through SkillPort, BCCC's online training tool, the following diversity-related modules are offered: Bridging the Diversity Gap; Your Role in Workplace Diversity; Facing the Management Challenges of Difficult Behavior & Diverse Teams; Workplace Management - Global HR, 69Diversity, & Inclusion; Diversity on the Job: Diversity & You; Diversity on the Job: The Importance of Diversity & the Changing Workplace; Understanding Unconscious Bias; Overcoming Your Own Unconscious Bias; Overcoming Unconscious Bias in the Workplace; Maintaining a Cohesive Multigenerational Workforce; Using Communication Strategies to Bridge Cultural Divides; and Culture & Its Effect on Communication. Table 5: BCCC Professional Development Offerings: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Safe Spaces This workshop ensures that participants are sensitive to all the nuances in our culture today as it relates to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning, Intersex and Asexual (LGBTQIA) community. The workshop reviews best practices in int erfacing with the community, and attendees learn to better identify and avoid intentional or unintentional speech or actions that may cause offense. Stereotypes & Microaggressions This workshop raises awareness to unintentional or unconscious stereotyping that we may be doing when interfacing with our peers. The concept of microaggressions, subtle acts or comments that stereotype others, is introduced and discussed. Strategies to av oid microaggressions are reviewed. Diversity & Inclusion This workshop stresses the importance of being inclusive with people of other backgrounds in our personal and professional lives, as well as the benefits of living and working in a diverse communi ty. The concept of bias is discussed, as well as what we can do to avoid bias and be more inclusive with all of our peers to foster innovative thought and a greater sense of community. Generational Issues This workshop examines the different generation s that make up our community and work force. Attendees learn about the different generations, their unique needs and wants, and how to best interface with them. Dynamics among the different generations in society are reviewed and discussed. Diversity on C ampus This workshop is comparable to the Diversity & Inclusion session, but it focuses more on campus life. Attendees gain a greater understanding and awareness to the melting pot that is our campus. Diversity as a strength as it pertains to higher educati on institutions is an underlying theme. Conflict Resolution This workshop focuses on best practices to resolve conflict and differences in a civil fashion. Conflict can be a side effect in an environment that has a great deal of diversity, and this workshop equips attendees with the skills needed to ensure that we maintain civility, respect, and dignity in resolving conflict with our peers. In terms of recruiting faculty and staff, the Human Resources Office utilized the following websites to attract a diverse applicant pool: Marylanddiversity.com, Diversityjobs.com, Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (HERC), Academiccareers.com, The Maryland Workforce Exchange, and Indeed.com The gender and ethnic distributions of BCCC's full-time faculty and staff for fall 2019 are provided in Charts 6 and 7. The proportions of faculty and staff remained relatively stable from fall 2018 to fall 2019, with a slight increase from 1.0% Hispanic employees to 1.6%. 70Table 6: BCCC Fall 2019 Full-Time Faculty and Staff Gender and Ethnic Background Counts Table 7: BCCC Fall 2019 Full-Time Faculty and Staff Gender and Ethnic Background Distribution Total Hispanic WhiteAfrican American AsianAmerican Indian / Native AlaskanNative Hawaiian / Pacific IslanderOther / Unknown Faculty Men 47 0 10 29 7 0 1 0 Women 59 0 13 44 2 0 0 0 Total 106 0 23 73 9 0 1 0 Administrators Men 22 0 2 18 2 0 0 0 Women 34 2 9 22 0 1 0 0 Total 56 2 11 40 2 1 0 0 Other Professional Staff Men 38 2 15 18 2 1 0 0 Women 72 2 12 54 4 0 0 0 Total 110 4 27 72 6 1 0 0 Support Staff Men 34 0 5 29 0 0 0 0 Women 60 0 4 55 0 1 0 0 Total 94 0 9 84 0 1 0 0 All Full-Time Employees 366 6 70 269 17 3 1 0Baltimore City Community College Fall 2019 Full-Time Faculty and Staff: Gender and Ethnic Background / Race Source: Fall 2019 BCCC Employee Data System file prepared for the Maryland Higher Education Commission.

Members of the DEI committee will be strongly encouraged to participate in this excellent training opportunity; Participation in the annual Diversity Institute, sponsored by Anne Arundel Community College, which addresses multicultural curriculum development; Consider options, including grant opportunities, to perform a comprehensive climate survey; and For FY2021, have a member of Human Resources trained on and certified in administering the IDI assessment. Campus Process for Reporting a Hate-Based Crime Protected Classes In accordance with The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a hate crime is a criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, ethnic origin or sexual orientation. (In addition to those mentioned above, other categories or identities may be protected depending on where the crime took place; local and State laws may vary and a federal offense may have been committed). BCCC (BCCC) is committed to creating and maintaining a welcoming and inclusive campus community. Every individual is valued and should feel welcomed and included as a member of this community. The Office for Public Safety serves to make sure ALL people at BCCC feel safe to be themselves. BCCC also strives to provide an educational, working and living environment that welcomes and respects all people. All of us are expected to commit to maintaining a safe, respectful, inclusive, civil and welcoming environment. Acts that go against th e core values of the institution destroy the sense of community we all share. Additionally, acts of intolerance do untold and unjust harm to the well-being, dignity and safety of those who are the victims of such acts. How to Report a Bias Incident The Office for Public Safety receives and responds to reports of bias incidents that have been experienced or witnessed. Reports will be reviewed in a timely manner. When reporting an incident, the individual has the option of reporting it as \"informatio n only\" or \"request for follow up.\" \"Information only\" reports are intended to give The Office for Public Safety information on an individual's experience at BCCC. These reports help The Office for Public Safety keep a pulse on the campus climate. Things to report as \"information only\" would include hearing insensitive remarks or language not directed at an individual, noticing certain trends of bias that have not targeted a specific individual, etc. Reports can be filed anonymously. However, if the report is filed anonymously it may limit the response The Office for Public Safety can have. Every effort will be made to keep your report confidential. However, the members of Public Safety, as administrative agents in an educational institution, adhere to the laws and standards governing the disclosure of information to third parties both within and external to the College. Conclusion BCCC embraces its position in embracing all people. The belief that a diverse faculty, staff and student body enriches all members of the BCCC community. The Cabinet along with the DEI Committee drives the goals and activities for the College. The College's support for the Committee reflects the institution's commitment to an inclusive, safe, and diverse environment where honest discussion drives positive change of diversity, equity and inclusion. The Committee will assess the campus climate for diversity, identify underrepresented or under-served groups, enact programs or support services to enhance these groups' experiences at BCCC and assess the effectiveness of the programs and services offered. The Committee will always be guided by the Board of Trustees, Cabinet, and leadership of the institution to sustain a welcoming environment for everyone to learn and to work. 72Carroll Community College Definition of Diversity and Process 73Since 2017, Carrol Community College has strategically looked at refining and redefining its diversity efforts which included a revision to the charge of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee; General Education goals and requirements revised and approved by the College 's Academic Council in June 2018; and revised goals related to global citizenship and awareness . The College 's Board of Trustees also approved a revised College Mission Statement and goals in spring 2018. In 2020, the President set the hiring of an Executive Director for Diversi ty, Equity, and Inclusion as a priority to guide day -to-day diversity efforts and to create an institutional vision for D iversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) work. The Executive Director was hired in January 2021 during the C OVID -19 pandemic and began a listening tour across all areas of the College (Academics, Operations, Administration, Faculty, Staff, and Students) . The Exec utive Director crafted the definitions of Diversity, Equity , and Inclusion based on an analysis of what the College community outlined in the listening tours , conversations and interviews, review of MHEC Diversity reports, and guidance of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee . The DEI definitions are in a document entitled Carroll Community College Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Philosophy, which also encompasses a Diversity Commitment Statement and Civility Statement (A ppendix I) . The draft of the document was shared with the D iversity and Inclusion Committee for review and edits, then shared across the College for review and a comment period of 30 days in a series of meetings including the Board of Trustees, our Foundation Board, S enior Leadership Team , the Senate, Academic Affairs , and the Student Government Organization . The final review of the document was shared at the College wide meeting which is open to all employees . Considerations to comments and edits were woven into the final document titled Carroll Diversity Philosophy. The Carroll Diversity , Equity, and Inclusion Philosophy was created with four main sections, the first of which define s diversity, equity, and inclusion from our perspective . The second section is the Carroll Commitment Statement that express es Carroll's on-going commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion and prompts the College to regularly evaluate its policies, procedures, and practices to ensure that we are fully supporting our diverse co mmunity and that we remove barriers that may negatively impact students, employees, and the Carroll County community we serve. The third section i ncludes Civility Statements that guide behavior , and the last section is a glossary of DEI terms compiled to assist the reader in understanding the current or updated definitions of a broad spectrum of diversity terms. Carr oll Community College 's defin ition of diversity: The definition of diversity is continually evolving as our knowledge and/or understanding of people and their needs change. We currently understand diversity to include ability/disability, age, class, economic status, race, ethnicity, color, national origin, language, visa status, gende r identity and expression, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, religion, political beliefs, height, weight, and veteran status. We also embrace differing and well- reasoned ideas, theories, approaches, individual beliefs, values, and perspectives as essential components of an inclusive community that are welcomed as long as they are respectful of others. 74 Ongoing Institutional Initiatives Designed to Address Issues Related to Cultural Diversity 75Assessment and revision of the General Education curriculum, including diversity -designated courses, is an ongoing initiative that directly supports one of the College 's five s trategic priorit ies: Prepare students for diverse work environments and a dynamic, connected global community. This effort is significant as nearly all learner s in credit -bearing programs complete General Education coursework. Defining diversity competencies , collecting and analyzing data, and providing learning opportunities to support faculty have been important components. Benchmarking and D ata Collection In Academic Year (AY) 2017- 2018, the College undertook a program review of all General Education courses. Through this pro cess , General Education competencies were benchmarked against the AAC&U VALUE rubrics and the Lumina Foundation's Degree Qualifications Profile. Local competencies were established; \"identifying their roles as global citizens in a multicultural country and world\" is one of the eight General Education goals. This review reinforced and refined the inclusion of diversity- designated courses as a graduat ion requirement for all degree- seeking students . The scaffolded skills assessed in diversity -designated courses were adapted from related VALUE rubrics. Benchmarking expectations against outside entities has clarified and reinforced essential skills for both students and faculty. Signature Assignments are used to assess student skills in each course. Data is collected each semester; every course is assessed at least once biannually . Faculty Development The pro ject has involved many stakeholders : General Education Committee members, Academic Council representatives, and faculty teaching diversity- designated courses . Through this process, the questions that have arisen have helped uncover gaps in our collective understanding and led to sustained , faculty -driven professional learning , building both faculty capacity and buy -in. During AY 2020- 2021, 21 G eneral Education Committee members and full -time faculty teaching diversity- designated courses participated in multiple learning sessions rooted in best practices and m irroring student skill development, using the Intercultural Development Inventory (IDI). This instrument assesses intercultural competence and provides a n individualized, actionable developmental plan . A qualified IDI administrator led a portion of the training; members of the College 's Diversity and Inclusion Committee , and the College's Intercultural Teachi ng and Learning Fellows provided scaffolding and extension sessions. Next steps In AY 2021- 2022, intercultural learning opportunit ies continue to be offered to the initial cohort ; a second cohort will include full- time faculty as well as adjunct faculty teaching diversity- designated General Education courses. During AY 2020- 2021, work also advanced that will further facilitate the process by which diversity- designated courses will be regularly assesse d to determine effectiveness; this process will be fully implemented during AY 2021 -2022. 76 COVID -19 Impact 77Over the last 5 years, Carroll's non -white student population grew from 13 percent to 19.1 percent in Spring 2021 and increased from 17.9 percent year -over -year. This growth has been primarily due to increased outreach efforts. As the pandemic began , we became concerned about student s' well-being and their ability to complete , and we understood the uneven impact on our community of color. Therefore, in respon se to the pandemic , Carroll Community College developed overarching institutional goals as the College shifted to entirely online operations . Goals included: maintaining continuity of instruction , offering all student support services virtually and providing financial, academic , mental health , and technical resources a s well as equipment for online learning. In March 2020, the College accelerated efforts related to the design and delivery of instructional programs and help ed faculty shift to entirely online instruction. A top priority was to assur e that all students and employees had the necessary tools to learn and work success fully . Carroll surveyed students, identified their technology needs , and provided essential tech nology resources for all students who need ed them, thus addressing issues of th e digital divide for under -resourced students. For example, t he College issued laptops , printers , and hotspots to students who needed hardware and reliable internet to access and complete coursework every semester since March 2020. Our technology loaner program will continue through Fall 2021. In Fall 2020 and Spring 2021, instructional delivery included on- campus instruction for targeted student populations. Approximately one -third of credit course offerings were delivered in a face -to-face or hybrid format. A bout one-third of all credit courses were offered in asynchronous online format , and the remaining one -third were offered online -synchronous format , or a combined online synchronous/asynchronous format. Additionally, t he College took extensive measures to reach out to students to determine their state of wellness and assess their adjustment to our virtual learning and remote activities environment , and f aculty and staff increased the use of our Starfish outreach retention system , to monitor student attendance and communicate with students about their ongoing performance. Among the many initiatives implemented to provide students with ca re, support, and as complete of a campus -like experience as possible, the College awarded over $1,130,000 in Coronavirus Relief Funds to eligible students who were negatively impacted by COVID- 19. Through the generosity of local donors, the Carroll Communi ty College Foundation raised over $50,000 in emergency financial assistance for students in need and made available $250,000 in institutional scholarships to students who did not qualify for relief funds. As a result of all these efforts, v ery similar completion outcomes were achieved for each semester since the pandemic began. For example, withdrawal rate s in Fall 2020 were only slightly higher than in Fall 2019, from 5.5 to 5.8 percent. Student completion, grade distribution data and success rates were also achieved at very similar rates to those achieved during pre- pandemic semesters. Carroll Community College remains strongly committed to th e ongoing assessment of all student needs and to working with student organizations to provide mental health programs, technology resources, and enhanced availability of financial aid resources. We will continue to foster engagement and a strong sense of belonging and the completion of stated goals by providing a safe learning and working environment that models respect, acceptance, inclusion, and empathy towards diverse ways of thinking and being. 78Carroll Community College - Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Action Plan FY2021 Carroll Community College maintains a mission goal to \"foster campus and civic engagement and a sense of belonging, by providing a safe learning environment that models respect, acceptance, inclusion, and empathy towards diverse ways of thinking and being.\" To that end, efforts supporting diversity, e quity and inclusion are embedded in College goals and planning and activities at all levels and across departments and divisions. The plan presented here aligns with Compass 2025, the College's strategic planning document which guides resource allocation and decision making. While Compass 2025 includes one initiative specifically related to diversity and global citizenship, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) tasks are nested under four of the five priorities. DEI work at Carroll Community College is le d by a seven -member Diversity and Inclusion Steering Team. Members of the steering team represent key areas of responsibility and expertise on the campus. Recent efforts have involved looking outside the institution to identify best practices related to DEI that might be adapted and implemented at Carroll, while also looking inside the institution for available data and existing resources to set and accomplish goals. Further, a significant focus in the past years has been on expanding professional learnin g opportunities for faculty and staff; this effort continues and expands in the plan for FY 2021. 79CCC Strategic Priority I: Student Success - Provide an empowering educational experience to support students from initial contact through completion of their educational goals.

Becki Maurio 812020 -2021 Cultural Diversity Plan Institutional Narrative Prepared by Kimberly Joyce, Vice President Student Services Reviewed and Approved by the Cecil College Board of Trustees on June 24, 2021 Submitted to the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) by July 1, 2021 821)A description of how the institution defines \"cultural\" diversity (no more than one page ); how did the institution develop that definition (e.g., processes, sources, and guidance used)? \"Cultural Diversity\" definition at Cecil College We believe that diversity should be valued and sustained throughout the organization. Therefore, we will continue to uphold and champion diversity, inclusion, and equity as a vital part of our mission, vision, core values, and culture by promoting respect and recognizing differences as strengths. The College recognizes cultural diversity to be a community with valued differences with regard to age, race, national origin, ethnicity, language differences, religious affiliation, political beliefs, sex ual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic background, and ability/disability. The College also recognizes that this definition is ever evolving and expanding. At Cecil College, we strive to build and maintain a culture of diversity, equity, inclusio n, and achievement through our programming, resource allocation, event planning, and partnership building. Our goals include advancing the social and economic mobility of all members of our diverse community. We strive to empower our students and employees to strengthen themselves and others to achieve their maximum potential, in part by recognizing their own privilege and biases. We will continue working together to build alliances across differences so we can lessen all forms of discrimination. Cecil College's Non -Discrimination and Harassment Policy Cecil College strives to create and maintain a work environment where people are treated with dignity, decency, and respect. Cecil College will not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind. All em ployees, regardless of their positions, are covered by and are expected to comply with this policy, and to take appropriate measures to ensure that prohibited conduct does not occur. Cecil College prohibits discrimination against any member of the College community or any applicant for employment based on race, color, national origin, ancestry, age, religion, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, genetic status, genetic information, veteran status or any other status protected by federal, state or local law. Cecil College developed this definition using the following documents and policies for guidance: Mission Vision Core Values Strategic Plan Inclusive Campus Commitments Non -Discrimination and Harassment Policy Several constituencies within the college and local community provided input on and approved of the College's definition of Cultural Diversity. Diversity, Equity and Inclusivity Task Force Inclusivity Collaborative Academic Senate (Faculty) Administrative/Professional organization (APO) Classified Staff Organization (CSO) College Management Team (CMT) President's Staff Maryland Community College Diversity Roundtable (MCCDR) 832)A brief (no more than one page ) highlight of the most successful ongoing and new institutional initiatives designed to address issues related to cultural diversity within the campus and the broader community, and how their efficacy is measured. Since 2012, the College's Cultural Diversity Plan (CDP) has been aligned with the Maryland State statutory provision \u00a711-406 of the Education Article and the College's strategic priorities. Cecil's CDP has always been a collaboration with a variety of departments on campus, from Admissions to Academics and Student Services. The annual CDP is also reviewed and approved by our Multicultural Student Services Advisory Board (MSSAB), a group of individuals from various businesses and organizations in Cecil County. One of the College's most successful and ongoing initiatives to address issues related to cultural diversity with in the campus and the broader community has been the creation of a two key groups, The Diversity Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Task Force and the Inclusivity Collaborative. Both of these groups work to ensure that the College community prioritizes, recognize s, and values cultural diversity. The College created the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) Task Force in the summer of 2020. The membership is comprised of a diverse body of employees across the College. The Task Force allows Cecil College to contin ue and further deepen its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion for students, employees, and community members. In fall 2020, the Task Force worked to create an external DEI webpage on the Cecil College public facing website. The website went public in January 2021. The College also launched its Inclusive Campus Commitments in January 2021. The goal of the Inclusive Campus Commitments is to foster respectful dialogue between members and guests of the college community. Currently, these Commitments are visible in several areas across the College, including the external DEI webpage as well as our internal employee portal. Faculty are encouraged to include them in syllabi and all new employees receive them as part of their welcome email. Inclusivity Collaborative The Inclusivity Collaborative is a voluntary group of Cecil College staff and faculty who share an interest in fostering a more accepting and supportive campus environment. Open to all College faculty and staff, this group advances initiatives that address the heightened divisions among different communities in the United States in a way that positively encourages growth on our campus. The Inclusivity Collaborative was formed in 2016 and since then, they have sponsored 3-5 educational programs per year for the college community. \"Race in the Classroom\" Faculty and Staff Training Academic Programs facilitated two professional development workshops during the 2020 -21 academic year. Dr. Cyndi Kernahan shared strategies outlined in her book, Teaching about Race and Racism in the College Classroom. All employees were invited, with attendance required for full -time faculty. Cecil College United Solidarity Event in Remembrance of George Floyd, June 16, 2020 Dr. Mary Way Bolt joined the Reverend Brown from the Wright's A.M.E. Church in Elkton MD to host a virtual ceremony in remembrance o f George Floyd. The Cecil College community was invited and the program included music, Cecil College student Alexis Wilks -Brown reciting Maya Angelou's \"Still I Rise,\" Dr. Tomeka Swan, Cecil College Registrar sharing a personal reflection, and 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silent reflection. The College has offered many additional programs and activities for the college community and the residents of Cecil County. A full list is provided in the appendix. The efficacy of Cecil College's diversity efforts is measured through strategic planning annual reports, IPEDS and VFA data reports, the annual MHEC Performance and Accountability Report, Modern Think Employee Survey results, student focus groups, and the Community College Survey of Student Engagement. 843)A brief (no more than one page ) discussion of the ways in which the institution anticipates COVID -19 most affecting - either negatively or positively - its efforts to enhance diversity on its cam pus or campuses. This may include, for example, acknowledgement of issues such as disproportionate impacts on retention and graduation among certain populations; the shift to distance education modalities limiting the ability to provide in-person programmi ng; or, in contrast, the shift to online education providing opportunity for more students to access diversity programming. Cecil College anticipated that Covid -19 would negatively affect enrollment and retention. Research conducted by the National Student Clearinghouse showed that, in the fall of 2020, community colleges experienced significant enrollment declines due to Covid -19, with Native American, Black and Hispanic students experiencing a disproportionate negative impact. Cecil College experienced an annual enrollment decline on par with the national average; however, we did not experience a significant decline in the percent of nonwhite students enrolling (23.11% for 2020 vs 21.40% for 2015). Additionally, the 2020 retention ra te overall was 61%, an increase from 57% for 2019, and the rates increased for black or African American students from 54% in 2019 to 61% in 2020 and for Hispanics from 40% in 2019 to 57% in 2020. Cecil College transitioned to a remote learning environment (with the exception of a small number of lab and health care courses) in March 2020, and anticipated that many students, particularly low -income and first - generation students, would need assistan ce securing the technology and internet access required for distance education. Early on, the College provided technology scholarships through the Cecil College Foundation to help students obtain computers and wifi devices. The College also trained a team of Online Learning Coaches to provide one -on-one tutoring with students on how to access Blackboard and leverage technology for success. In March 2021, the College conducted a Class Delivery Survey to both students and faculty. The results indicated that b oth groups prefer a mix of in -person and online classes. Before the pandemic, the College offered a limited number of distance education courses, but one positive outcome of COVID -19 is that our online offerings are now varied and robust and faculty learne d additional technical skills required for online instruction including use of Wiki, online journals, Perusall, Blackboard Collaborate, and Respondus among others. Our \"new normal\" will be a course schedule comprised of on -campus, hyflex, hybrid, and onlin e courses. We are hopeful that the flexible course schedule will alleviate the burdens our students face when juggling college with transportation challenges, family obligations, and the need to work. The shift to distance education and the need for social distancing required us to cancel all in -person diversity programming. The Coordinator of Student Diversity & Inclusivity, The Inclusivity Collaborative and Multicultural Student Services Advisory Boar d continued to offer events virtually, allowing for an increase in student attendance to cultural events. The events are included in the appendix and many were relevant and well attended. For example, in March 2021, The Inclusivity Collaborative hosted a S peaker Series event titled \"Public Health in the Pandemic: Lessons Learned from Covid.\" One of the speakers, Dr. Marshala Lee, Board - Certified Physician and Director of the Harrington Value Institute Community Partnership Fund and Christiana Care, discuss ed \"Social Determinants of Health: Addressing Racial and Economic Disparities Exacerbated by the Covid -19 Pandemic.\" In her presentation, she shared data and reasons for higher incidences of Covid -19 in the Black, Hispanic and Native American communities. The event was well received by both faculty and students. Overall, attendance at multicultural events during the pandemic was the same or better compared to previous years, primarily due to the convenience of attending virtually and the increase in college collaborations. 85Institutional 2020- 2021 Cultural Diversity Plan Prepared by Kimberly Joyce, Vice President Student Services Reviewed and Approved by the Cecil College Board of Trustees on June 24, 2021 Submitted to the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) by July 1, 2021 86Cultural Diversity Plan for 2020 - 2021 The Cecil College Cultural Diversity Plan outlines the ef forts the College makes to enhance cultural diversity programming and sensitivity to cultural diversity through instruction and training of the student body, faculty, and staff.

The Task Force is chaired by the Executive Director of Human Resources and has twelve members comprised of faculty and staff. The task force works under the following directive: \"At Cecil College, we believe that diversity should be visible, valued, and sustained throughout the organization. We continue to uphold and champion diversity, inclusion, and equity as a vital part of our mission, vision, core values, and culture.\" In addition to the main Task Force, subcommittees exist in the following areas : Employee Development (recruitment, retention), Climate and Culture (review of institutional policies and practices), Professional Development (employee training), and Data Assessment (routine assessment of current data). The Task Force worked with the C ollege community to create a diversity and inclusion website posted on the College's external website and the internal portal. The site contains information and resources organized in three main categories: student resources, scholarship opportunities, and college initiatives. Inclusivity Collaborative Working in conjunction with the DEI Task Force, the Inclusivity Collaborative is a voluntary group of Cecil College staff and faculty who share an interest in fostering a more accepting and supportive campus environment. Open to all College faculty and staff, this group advances initiatives that address the heightened divisions among different communities in the United States in a way that positively encourages growth on our campus . Multicultural Student Services Advisory Board (MSSAB) The MSSAB is comprised of Cecil County community members and College representatives. Members join the College in recruitment and retention initiatives for underrepresented students, faculty and 87staff. The Board meets on a quarterly basis to receive College and community updates and to organize scholarship initiatives. The Board also reviews and offers input for the Multicultural Plan to the Maryland Higher Education Commission. The College maintains community alliances with th e League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) Elkton, APG Federal Credit Union, Elkton NAACP, and Upper Chesapeake Bay Pride. Coordinator of Student Diversity and Inclusion These three groups work in collaboration with Mayra Castillo, the Coordinator of Student Diversity and Inclusion, a full-time staff member who mentors underrepresented students, coordinates multicultural programs and activities, serves as an active member of the DEI Task Force and the Inclusivity Collaborative, and advises the MSSAB. 2.Inclusive Campus Commitments The DEI Task Force and the Inclusivity Collaborative created \"Inclusive Campus Commitments,\" guidelines for civil discourse on campus. The guidelines are posted on the Colleges website: https://www.cecil.edu/wp -content/uploads/inclusive -campus -commitments.pdf 3. College -wide Professional Development \"Unleashing the Power of Inclusion\" Human Resources worked with an external trainer to provide the college community with foundational and fundamental training focused on the creation of a common language and understanding around diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). The workshop addressed foundational awareness around diversity, equity, an d inclusion, and topics included self -awareness and reflection, the power of inclusion, and how to lead and partner inclusively. (October/November 2020) \"Race in the Classroom\" Two professional development sessions were held in the spring of 2021 for facul ty and staff. Presented by Cyndi Kernahan, a professor of psychological sciences and the Director of the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning at the University of Wisconsin -River Falls, the sessions focused on inclusivity and engagement in teaching and student interactions.

In the past several years race relations have been even more politicized and people have been emboldened to speak out against what they see as unfair advantages given to nonwhite people . The history, sentiment, and voting patterns, of the Eastern Shore have traditionally reject ed overt stands to honor our diversity. However, for those of us who reside here and count among us friends, neighbors, and family who hold such beliefs, we kno w that getting past this knee -jerk reaction is critical. Most politically conservative residents would not self -identify as racist. They have friends or co -workers of color whom they respect. They would agree that all people need a fair chance to earn a livelihood a nd that people should be treated equally. Efforts to help the population move toward greater recognition of what has contributed to economic inequity and what constitutes fairness in our society has to begin with definitions that are palatabl e to the politicized mind. It is with this intention that the committee deliberated, researched, and composed our definitions of diversity, equity, and inclusion. It is the hope of our committee that the DEI initiative at Chesapeake College can open mind s and establish more inclusive practices that create more equity for the students at the college and the citizens of the Eastern Shore. Chesapeake College can be a beacon for this region by putting the right foot forward and leading by example in a way th at reduces barriers and promotes understanding. For this initiative to be successful, clear definitions were needed so that people would know what we mean when we talk about \"DEI\". We wanted to create definitions that communicate the values we aim to pr omote, and also clarify our intentions for those who reactively reject such efforts. The definitions adopted by the committee and shared with the President and the chairs of the work groups are: Diversity is understanding that each individual is unique among multiple dimensions, including but not limited to, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio -economic status, age, abilities, and beliefs. Diversity encompasses the multitude of ways in which we experience and navigate the world. Equity is the fair distribution of services and resources to ensure equal opportunity. It is the result of the ongoing process of creating an environment where each individual has the access and means needed to be suc cessful. Inclusion is the practice of respecting and welcoming all people as a part of the Chesapeake College community. An inclusive environment recognizes the inherent worth and dignity of each individual. The committee arrived at these definitions aft er several meetings in which we search our own backgrounds regarding what these terms mean to us. Several committee members included examples of definitions and descriptions found in internet searches. We wrote and re -wrote the terms in light of the valu es we wish to promote. 94Initiatives The most significant institutional initiative to address diversity issues on our campus and in our community is the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiative that began in fall 2020 , in part as a response to the nation wide activism which re -emerged in the summer of 2020 . Under this initiative, the college has created four work groups, each with a different focus. They are Philosophy, Mission and Administrative Leadership; Teaching, Faculty and Support Services; Staff Engagement and Involvement; and Student Support. Each group is led by two co -chairs and comprises 10 or more volunteers. These groups will lead the college in this multi -year process to help move toward a more equitable and accessible institution. This year these groups began meeting to engage in meaningful discussion/planning. In addition, several outside agencies have provided training for the administration, faculty, and staff to help educate them on DEI issues, local history, and prepare them to cre ate meaningful change in the workplace and for our students. Training sessions lead by the Cambio group , a DEI consulting firm, have been held with all members of the work groups at this point. The following objectives will guide the work groups : 1. How can C hesapeake College cultivate an inclusive community that offers equitable access and support across the diverse spectrum of populations it employs and serves? Such a community will welcome and empower people across the spectrums of race, socioeconomic stat us, military service experience, educational attainment, employment level, gender, and age. 2. How do we uncover either formal (institutionalized) barriers for access, entry, and retention or more informal issues with individual bias, attitudes, and work place behavior that erect barriers and obstacles to student access and success? 3. How do we begin, maintain and sustain constructive discussion that leads to action and results (over the long term)? 4. As we evolve the institution currently with existing staff, once we get to a better place how do we continue improvement in these areas and onboard new employees to continue that progress (again, over time)? 5. How do we get our various committees started in discussion that leads to concrete progress regarding identi fication of areas to develop, task to be completed, and identification of strategic initiatives that will get us where we need to go - this year , within 2 years, out to a five -year strategic plan? With the advent of DEI initiative, the college has added ad ditional strategies to the Strategic Plan. The college currently employs 1 9 different Key Performance Indicators to evaluate progress towards diversity -related goals. Much of the work of this new initiative is forthcoming. The shape this takes, and what comes from it , is yet to be determined. But we are off to a meaningful start. One suggestion, under consideration by the Diversity Committee for several years, is the requirement of a Diversity Goal to be included in each employee's professional develo pment plan (faculty) or performance goals (staff and administration). Employees will work with immediate supervisors to select appropriate goals for each individual, and the Diversity Committee will provide recommendations of 95appropriate activities off ca mpus as well as arranging learning opportunities on campus. Implementation of this project is in process. In spite of limited opportunities for face to face activities, the newly hired Coordinator of Diversity and Inclusion and the Director of Student Lif e have implemented a number of online activities that increase student awareness of our diverse college community as well as resources available to all students. They presented well -received Zoom sessions to both faculty and staff groups to facilitate conv ersations about difficult topics like racism, and are available for follow up session with different groups. As face to face activities resume, we anticipate additional opportunities for collaboration in this area. Impact of Pandemic The effects of the pa ndemic were felt in many ways. The college initially cut noncredit offerings by 50%, moving some courses online and eliminating many sections taught in -person . This necessitated the movement of Adult Basic Education and ESL courses to an online format. Credit headcount decl ined by - 12% in FY2021, but the decrease in headcount did not disp roportionately affect one race/ethnicity group or another. However, while the number of completed courses declined -8% for white students, it declined -19% for student s of color. Black students also accounted for a disproportionate fraction of total FTE loss in FY2021. The work groups join the entire college in exploring reasons for this discrepancy, including but not limited to helping students navigate an online env ironment, accessing support services remotely, as well as access and availability of reliable internet service in the region. Not all the effects off the pandemic were negative. The forced transition to online classes made many programs and courses adapt to a more accessible online format. After an initial decline this past year, it is expected that the number of students in ESL courses will increase due to the availability of these courses online. In addition to the spread of online instruction, many st udent services also were implemented online for the first time. Students were enabled to access tutoring and placement testing online. Advising was also implemented online. In 2021 we exceeded our target the percentage of noncredit students from minorit y groups. We met our target for minority graduation rate, as well as learning objectives that demonstrate proficiency in diverse perspectives. The spring 2021 Student Satisfaction Survey saw increase in satisfaction from these services after initial decl ines a year ago when they were forced to move online quickly. The Director of Student Life also reported better attendance during online orientation than in the face -to-face meeting held previously. 96Appendix 2020 - 2024 Diversity Plan Mission : The Diversity Committee recognizes the value of diversity in persons and in perspectives. It is our goal to create and sustain an inclusive and equitable environment in which all members of our college and surrounding community have opportunities to thrive per sonally and professionally.

We are pleased to submit , in accordance with \u00a711 -406 of the Education Article, our 2021 Cultural Diversity Report . I.How the College of Southern Maryland Defines Diversity In July 2020, CSM changed the name of its Diversity and Inclusion O ffice Wo \u00b3EqXiW\\ and InclXViYe DiYerViW\\,\u00b4 embrac ing the now-heralded concept of inclusive diversity in two senses: (1)As commitment to the inclusion of both (a) historically underrepresented racial and eWhnic groXpV (MHEC\u00b6V concepW of \u00b3 cXlWXra l diYerViW\\) and (b) the broader spectrum of federally protected classes under Civil Rights law, which encompass es all people . (2)As commitment not only to ensuring the representation of diverse groups at CSM , but also ensuring their inclusion in all facets of the life of the College. The first sense of inclusive diversity challenges CSM to commit to both (a) acknowledging and addressing the historical marginalization of minoritized groups (including but not limited to race and ethnicity) and (b) attending to the ways all people are potentially vulnerable to discrimination and harassment in virtue of their identity status. Every person is a member of a federally protected class: every person has a race, color, religious status, national origin, sex/gender identity, age, disability status, citizenship status, genetic profile, veteran status, marital status, and pregnancy status. At CSM, we offer programming, affinity groups, and other resources to increase awareness of the distinctive concerns of groups historically underrepresented and marginalized in higher education and of the requirement to mitigate patterns of systemic unfairness against them, to achieve educational and economic equity for all. At the same time, we offer professional developm ent to ensure all employees understand the protections of all under Civil Rights Law. The concept of inclusive diversity in its second sense reminds us that representation is a necessary but insufficient condition for reaping the benefits of diversity (e.g., better collaboration, learning, problem solving, innovation ). Required is inclusion : habit ual respect and welcoming that reflects the desire to have members of diverse groups contribut ing their knowledge, perspectives, and expertise in all aspects of t he life of the College . Inclusive diversity in this sense brings more human capital to the table, optimiz ing decision making and enhancing the overall vibrancy of the CSM experience for students, employees, and community partners . 992 II.Our Most Successful Initi atives to Promote Cultural Diversity at CSM 1.Cultural and Global Awareness Core Competency Requirement All credit students at CSM must complete a 3 -credit course designated as fulfilling the core curriculum requirement in Cultural and Global Awareness. Courses in this category examin e multicultural societies or peoples and help engender a richer understanding of the diverse life experiences of societal groups. Societal groups include but are not limited to r ace, class, gender, ethnicity, language, and religion. Students gain increased understanding of cultures while learning to communicate effectively across cultural differences. We assess the efficacy of the Cultural and Global Awareness Core Competency using a variety of methods , including the IDEA CenWer\u00b6V Student Ratings of Instruction (SRI) survey system , annual assessment s of at least one student learning objective in every course, and a five-year cycle of full course reviews . 2.Achieving the Dream CSM\u00b6V determination to achieve greater institutional equity, along with cultural diversity, informed our decision in 2019 to join Achieving the Dream (ATD) , a network of more than 300 colleges in 43 states that are innovat ing to implement, align, and scale cutting -edge reforms to improv e student success. ATD offers a capacity -building framework that allow s colleges to pinpoint strengths and areas for improvement across seven institutional capacitie s, including equity . ATD considers the pursuit of racial equity to be foundational to this work , maintain ing that all policies and practices affect racial equity . In Academic Year 2020 -21, CSM completed Year 2 of our ATD p articipation, designing interventions to clarify academic and career pathways, systematize supports, and demystify finances for students. These interventions , which are currently being launched , are designed to mitigate racial, socio -economic, and other di sparities that impede student access to CSM and their progress to transfer or completion . We measure and report our progress to ATD regularly using metrics that answer critical questions about how our under represented students are faring and how we believe our proposed interventions will improve their outcomes . We will dedicate Year 3 to a thorough evaluat ion these interventions. 3.CSM\u00b6s HeriWage and A. areness Challenges In July 2020, in the wake of the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ah mad Arbery, CSM hosted a n interactive, multi -media 30-Day Justice Challenge to examine racial injustices against Black people in America . The program featured independent online activities and live - virtual \u00b3check -in\u00b4 community conversations. ThaW iniWiaWiYe\u00b6V success prompted us to launch monthly Heritage and Awareness Challenge s exploring the lived experiences groups recognized in national heritage and awareness observances . We hosted 14 Heritage Awareness Challenges in Academic Year 2020 -2021, exploring religious celebrations, socio -economic disadvantage, and political ideologi es in addition to the official national observances . Faculty and staff participants earned professional development credits . All together, 687 employees, students, and community members completed the Challenges . The effectiveness of this initiative will be assessed via annual participant surveys (under development) . 100 3 III. Anticipated I mpact of the COVID -19 Pandemic on Efforts to Enhance Diversity CSM is well-positioned to sustain our efforts to promote inclusive diversity and equity notwithstanding the challenges of COVID -19. We understand that we are social justice through education . We believe equity means intentionally designing the CSM ex perience so that the needs of each student are me t in the face of challenges . Armed with these understanding s, and our awareness that higher education has changed forever for our students, in spring 2020 we laXnched CSM \u00b6V NeZ Deal, an initiative to redesign learning for greater equit y and economic mobility , and to revise the CSM footprint to extend classes more equitably across our region. CSM\u00b6V NeZ Deal enable d XV Wo W ake Whe long Y ieZ of COVID \u00b6V impacW on VWXdenWV bXW Z e\u00b6Ye also been keenly aware of its immediate effects and disparate impact on low-income and minoritized students . Our student body (credit and non -credit) is about 43% stude nts of color . An estimated 34% are low -income students (based on regional ALICE/poverty data). Just under 20% of credit students receive Pell Grants. We launched our first Student Support Survey in March 2020 to hear first -hand from students about their specific needs and challenges , and w e organized a Student Support Recovery Task Force to respond to their needs . Needs students have identif ied, across multiple surveys, as having the greatest impact on their pe rsistence are: Financial aid for tuition, books, and supplies Money for food, medicine, and living incidental costs Access to technology and the Internet Mental health support Childcare support Academic advising We acted swiftly to ensure students gained access to technology, support services, and other resources (e.g., food and incidentals) essential for academic success. The CSM Foundation immediately raised $25,000 that was distributed to students in April 2020 . We have given nearly $3M in CARES Act , CRRSA, and American Rescue Plan funds (including monies earmarked for the institution) and scholarship funds directly to our students . We froze tuitio n. We lent laptops and mobile hotspots to students and reopened access to computer labs by appointment. Our Student Life team has distributed more than 3,000 pounds of free food to students since May 2020 at 'Mobile Hawk Feeder' drive -thru events . The outcome is that o ur enrollment has remained steady overall , with no evident racial/ethnic disparities in attendance or persistence. We believe this is partly due to CSM\u00b6V response initiatives and partly to t wenty years of established success in online learning , which allowed us to provide students a seamless trans ition to high-quality virtual course experiences . For fields of study requiring hands -on learning, we were easily poised to offer a sanitized and distanced environment, when allowed to do so. Although overall enrollment remains steady, we are noticing a decline in male student enrollment, and especially among men of color for fall 2021 . In response, we have recruit ed employees to staff phones during the month of July to do direct outreach to current and prospective students. CSM\u00b6V New Deal, our Achieving the Dream interventions, and our new 2021 -2024 Institutional Strategic Plan, with its goal to \u00b3EnVXre equity in all programs and VerYiceV,\u00b4 position us well to continue to respond effectively to the needs of our diverse student body in this transformed educational landscape. 101APPENDIX College of Southern Maryland Plan for Cultural Diversity and Institutional Equity 2020 -2021 Approved by the Board of Trustees May 14, 2020 102College of Southern Maryland Plan for Cultural Diversity and Institutional Equity 2020- 2021 The College of Southern Maryland (CSM), an open-admissions, comprehensive regional community college, enhances lives and strengthens the economic vitality of a diverse and changing region by providing affordable postsecondary education, workforce development, and cultural and personal enrichment opportunities. Recognized in 2019 and 2020 with the Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence, Top 150 Community Colleges, CSM is committed to achieving outstanding outcomes for our diverse students, employees, and community members. Diversity, equity, respect, and integrity are among CSM's core institutional values. CSM has integrated into its Board-approved 2018-2021 Institutional Strategic Plan (ISP) four strategic objectives aimed at promoting cultural diversity and institutional equity. These four objectives comprise CSM's Plan for Cultural Diversity and Institutional Equity (CDIE). They are elaborated more fully here, in the context of their corresponding ISP goals and strategies, and with actions CSM will undertake to accomplish them specified. In this plan, cultural diversity means the inclusion of racial, ethnic, and other groups that have been underrepresented in higher education (Code of Maryland, Education Article 11-406). Institutional equity refers to the intentional design of the CSM experience to treat each student, employee, and visitor with respect, consideration, appropriate support, and fairness. CSM's determination to achieve greater institutional equity, along with cultural diversity, informed our decision to join Achieving the Dream (ATD), a network of more than 220 colleges in 43 states that are innovating to implement, align, and scale cutting-edge reforms to improve student success. ATD offers a capacity-building framework that allow s colleges to pinpoint strengths and areas for improvement across seven institutional capacitie s, including equity. As an ATD Network college, and to advance goals for equity and social mobility, CSM will report data using metrics that answer critical questions about how our lower-income and other underrepresented students fare. Aware of the disparate impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on Southern Maryland's lower-income and other underserved families, CSM has acted swiftly to ensure our students have access to technology, support services, and other resources (e.g., food and incidentals) essential for academic success. The higher education landscape has changed forever. This Plan for Cultural Diversity and Institutional Equity specifies actions CSM will take to sustain our commitment to equity and inclusion as we adapt and transform our delivery model in response to this crisis. 1032 CSM STRATEGIC PLAN GOAL 1: CSM will improve student progress and completion.

Our policies and practices are informed by Mar ilyn Loden 's (1996) work Implementing Diversity and reflect the four principles emphasized in the work: Respect, Inclusion, Cooperation, and Responsibility. In December 2020, CCBC launched the President's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Advisory Council. This body reviewed the definition of diversity at CCBC and brought guidance, wisdom, and sensitivity to the college's renewed commitment to advancing opportunity, ensuring equity, and respecting all faculty, staff, and students. Highlights of Institutional Initiatives Diversity is celebrated at CCBC and there are numerous initiatives in p lace to help employees and students develop knowledge and skills to participate effectively in evolving multicultural contexts and to address the challenges in building just, equitable, and productive societies. In reporting year 2020-2021, two of our most successful initiatives were Campus Life Programs, and Cultural ly Responsive Teaching and Learning (CRT -L) training. Campus L ife Programs The Office of Intercultural Engagement (O IE), CRT -L, and Human Resources hosted or provided 35 events. These included: Meditation/Discussion for Racial Healing (17 events) Implicit Bias Training/Discussion (6 events) Facing Whiteness Training (3 events) Mosaic Talks: Microaggressions, Privilege and Intersectionality, LGBT 101 (3 events) Restorative Justice Training (2 events) What's your Cultural Script (2 events) Meanings of Culture and Race (1 event) Courageous Conversations about Race with Baltimore County Police Department (1 event) CCBC also continued the Community Book Connection initiative. The book for academic year 2020-2021 was The Truth About Stories, A Native Narrative by Thomas King. OIE and CRT- L provided program ming in support of the initiative. C lassroom activities related to Native Americans focused on Native Americans and the Carlisle Industrial School , a project that gives voice to the Native American experience of forced assimilation during the boar ding school era in U.S. history (6 events) . In spr ing 2021, CCBC launched an assessment initiative for the Community Book Connection that is evaluating how members of the college community engage with the activities of the initiative. Surveys were administered to college employees and students to gauge participation 108rates, the range of activities pursued, and the benefits or outcomes of participating. Data analysis is underway. An additional strategy for evaluating outcomes includes determining whether students who participate in Community Book Connection activities in the classroom have higher retention and course success than the general rates o f retention and success. This evaluation will begin in summer 2021 and continue for subsequent semester s. Culturally Responsive Teaching and Learning (CRT- L) In FY2021, specific goals and outcomes for CRT- L were to: Goal Outcome Expand support for CCBC's Culturally Responsive Teaching and Learning (CRT - L) Initiative, gradually expanding diversity training to constituents college -wide. CCBC began Human Resources training in spring 2020 and continued training through HR professional development into spring 2021. Offer the CRT -L Seminar to 15 previously untrained CCBC faculty and professional staff. CCBC continued to offer our summer seminar to previously untrained faculty and staff. We had 10 attendees. Offer the CRT -L Workshop modules to 20 previously untrained adjunct faculty. In this period we offered two fall and two spring works hops to 56 attendees . Increase CRT -L training to CCBC student leaders and student organizations. CCBC offered a week of student trainings in January 2020 and again in January 2021. The students spent 4 hours each day over 5 days to complete the full seminar training. Host the FY2021 Culturally Responsive Teaching Conference for about 250 participants drawn from throughout the country. The conference occurred virtually over two days (March 11 -12, 2021) . There were 288 attendees from 2 and 4 year colleges and K-12 institutions. Provide CRT -L training to Johns Hopkins University faculty. CCBC offered four 2 -hour and four week -long trainings to JHU post-doctor al, doctoral, and other graduate students in this period. The training was available to other graduate students for the first time this year. There were 44 attendees. Continue to offer the CRT -L Institute. The Institute will offer a day of training in the CRT concepts CCBC has developed. CCBC offered the I nstitute in spring 2021. We had 36 attendees from K-12 and 2- and 4- year co lleges from across the nation. CCBC launched an assessment initiative in CRT -L that is evaluating how participation in the training translates into the use of culturally responsive practices in the classroom. Faculty who participate in the workshops in summer 2021 will be tracked into academic year 2021- 2022 and outcomes for their students, such as retention and course success, will be analyzed. Faculty diversity Another area where CCBC made progress was employee diversity. For f all 2020, CCBC reported 2,597 employees to the Maryland Higher Education Commission. This was the approximate number of full and part time permanent employees as of November 1, 2020. Full- 109time employees numbered 1,256. Disaggregating full- time employees by race, 26% of employees were African -American, 65% White, 4% Asian and 2% Hispanic Latino. The remaining 3% were of other races or chose not to supply information. CCBC has increased the percentage of African -American employees from 21% in fall 2011 to 26% in fall 2020. All other racial categories remained steady or showed small declines . The college recognizes the value of a diverse faculty for its students, workforce, and community. The composition of the faculty has not yet reached our diversity goal, but has increased in minority representation in the last five years. Since 2015, faculty of color have increased from 27% to 31% in 2020. Our professional employees are more diverse than our faculty. Among them, 27% are African -American, 64% White, 4% Asian 2% Asian and 2% Hispanic/Latino. COVID-19 Impacts on Cultural Diversity CCBC was able to offer cultural diversity related programming in virtual format for many initiatives . One initiative that was negatively affected was Courageous Conversations. Due to COVID -19, our Courageous Conversations Cohort did not convene for fall 2020. The program leader ship found that these kind of conversations are more effective in person. The attendees did not want to meet virtually as it is challenging to build trust at first sight without human interaction. The leadership group continued to meet, however, and transitioned to doing trainings with the Baltimore County Police Department. Based on enrollment trends for credit and continuing education programs, CCBC did not experience any significant impacts of COVID -19 on racial demographics between FY2019 and FY20 20. Enrollment rates for each racial group are within one per centage point between FY2019 and FY2020 for credit students, and within two percentage points for continuing education students. Base d on the Return Rate Table for f all 2020, f all-to-fall retention rates were not disproportionately impacted for racial or ethnic groups between fall 2019 and fall 2020. 110Commun ity College of Baltimore County FY2021 Cultural Diversity Plan CCBC is committed to providing an environment supportive of a highly diverse population of students, faculty and staff. The college has endeavored over the past decade to develop a number of distinct initiatives reflective of th e diverse communities we serve. The FY2021 Cultural Diversity Plan details successful efforts to date and outlines specific goals and plans for the coming year to ensure a welcoming environment for all faculty, students, and staff. Section I reviews CCBC's Strategic Plan as it relates to cultural diversity. Section II presents current statistics regarding the divers ity of CCBC's students, faculty and s taff. Section III outlines specific programs and initiatives planned for FY2021. Section IV provides a description of a successful strategy to increase faculty and staff diversity. Section V discusses CCBC policies and procedures on hate crime reporting. Data tables are included in the appendix. SECTION I: CCBC'S COMMITMENT TO CULTURAL DIVERSITY CCBC's commitment to cultural diversity is interwoven within the goals and values of the college's Strategic Plan. Our Mission is to \" ...transform lives by providing an accessible, affordable and high- quality education that prepares students for transfer and career success, strengthens the regional workforce, and enriches our community.\" To satisfy that mission, CCBC emphas izes the need for an awareness of cultural diversity in everything that we do. In our Strategic Plan, CCBC commits to nine values . Two values, in particular , relate to cultural diversity: Inclusi on: We value the diversity of people, cultures, ideas and viewpoints and honor the dignity of all persons. We are committed to preparing students to be active citizens , ready to meet the challenges of an increasing diverse world and a challenging global marke tplace. Collaboration : We foster continuous dialogue among students, faculty and staff and support ongoing cooperative relationships with our partners in the community regarding their educational, cultural, recreational and workforce needs. At CCBC, diversity includes, but is not limited to, race/ ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, physical ability, religion, gender identity and national origin. Our policies and practices are informed by Mary Loden's work on the various dimensions of cultural diversity. \"The goal for an organization is to create an environment where, regardless of one's diversity profile, everyone feels welcomed and where everyone's skills are leveraged. I can also demonstrate through my behavior that I am interested in showing respect, including others in activities, cooperating rather than competing to accomplish goals and taking responsibility for building a comfortable, diversity-positive environment.\" 1 1 Dean, Barbara and Lou, Kimberly. As quoted in Signs of Change - Global Diversity Puts New Spin on Loden's Diversity Wheel. http://www.loden.com/Web_Stuff/Articles_ -_Videos_- _Survey/Entries/2010/9/3_Global_Diversity_Puts_New_Spin_on_Lodens_Diversity_Wheel.h tml 111SECTION II: TRENDS AND CURRENT STATUS Students CCBC's student populat ion is diverse in terms of race/ethnicity, gender and age. In FY20 19 our total student population was 45.0% White, 33.7% African -American/Black , 5.6% Asian, Given our college's broad regional reach, CCBC is more diverse than Baltimore County, which in 2018 was 5 6.6% White and 29.0% African -American/Black .3 Our credit student body has remained racially diverse as total enrollments have fallen in recent years . In the period FY2015-FY2019, students of color increased from 54.6% to 5 8.5% of the credit student body. African -American/Black enrollment was flat during this period. Asian students increased from 6.6% to 8.1% of all credit students. Hispanic /Latino students increased from 4. 7% to 6.1% of credit students. White enrollment has declined from 4 5.2% of students to 41.0% . Other racial categories are less than 6 % of the credit student body. While race and gender data on Continuing Education students was incomplete in the past, data collect ion has improved. In FY 2019, 88.1% of students reported race information. Of those that reported, 44.1 % were students of color. African -Americans were 2 8.6% of our Continuing Education students, while Whites were 48.6%. CCBC is also diverse in terms of gender. In FY 2019, female students made up 56.4% of enrolled students. Credit students are 60.5% female, while Continuing Education students are 52.8% female. Gender trends have been stable over the last 5 years. Analysis of race and gender show areas where CCBC can be more diverse. Considering just credit students, there are 1.9 African -American female students for every male student. The corresponding ratios for White students is 1.4.4 CCBC has several initiatives directed toward improved recruitment, r etention and success of African -American/Black males . CCBC is open to a wide range of ages, fr om students still in K -12 to retirees.5 The average age for credit students is 2 8.1 years old and 46.3 years old for Continuing Education students. Recent trends have shown growth in th e number of credit students 17 or younger, due to expanded Early College high school enrollment opportunities at CCBC. From FY2015-FY2019, the number of students 17 or younger nearly doubled. The increase is particularly notable since overall CCBC enrollments declined -16.5% during the period. Employees CCBC considers a diverse workforce an important part of its overall commitment to diversity. CCBC employees are somewhat less diverse than the racial/ ethnic makeup of Baltimore County. Full- time employees were 3 4.3% persons of color in F all 2019, comparable to 43.4% for the overall Baltimore County population.6 African -American/Black employees are 26.0% of 2 Appendix Table 1 has race and gender information for all CCBC students. Table 2 has race and gender information for Credit students. Table 3 has race and gender information for Continuing Education students. 3 See appendix Table 8 for Baltimore County population by race. 4 See appendix tables 1c, 2c, 3c for combined race and gender information. 5 See appendix Table 4 for information on age groups for Credit and Continuing Education students. 6 See Table 5 for r ace and gender information on full -time employees. 112CCBC's full-time employees, compared to 29.0% of the Bal timore County population.7 Hispanic/Latino employees are 2. 0% of CCBC full -time employees, but make up 5.7% of the county population. Asians were 3. 8% of the CCBC workforce, less than the 6.3% of the Baltimore County population. CCBC employees are 63.5% female. Baltimore County is 52.6% female. Diversity among CCBC faculty members is an important goal. The college recognizes the value of a diverse fa culty for its students, workforce and community. The composition of the faculty has not yet reached our diversity goal , but has increased in minority representation in the last five years. Since 20 15, faculty of color have increased from 26.9% to 27.7% in 2019. In that time period, African -American/Black faculty has increased from 16.9% to 17.3 %. The increases are small, but given the overall stability in faculty positions it is a significant achievement. In terms of gender diversity , CCBC faculty are reflective of the student population: 59.8% female in 2019, comparable to 52.6% female for our student population. The composition of non- faculty staff is more diverse than faculty ranks. In Fall 2019, non- faculty staff were 37.4% persons of color, compared to 27.7% for faculty. 8 Support staff at CCBC is the most diverse group of employees, at 41.7% persons of color, followed by professional staff (34.8%) and administrative employees ( 21.9%), a small group of only 64 employees. SECTION III: FY2021 DIVERSITY PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES CCBC has implemented a wide range of programs, policies and initiatives to promote cultural diversity for stud ents, staff and the community. Section III discusses the major activities the college has undertaken in the last few years and the new initiatives developed for the coming year. The most substantial activity to be undertaken is the establishment of a President's Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Advisory Council. The death of George Floyd was a catalyst for prompting institutions to reevaluate their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. This was also true at CCBC when President Kurtinitis committed the college to the following actions. Provide an ongoing forum for uncomfortable conversations about race utilizing the talents and resources of the Offices of College Life and Intercultural Engagement to engage students, faculty and staff in a series of continuing discussions. Support and expand the professional development efforts of CCBC's Culturally Responsive Teachin g and Learning initiative to influence classroom pedagogy and methodology. Face squarely the data that show the deficiencies in academic performance and completion of African -American students, especially African -American males, and develop active retentio n and completion initiatives to close those gaps. Analyze CCBC's hiring patterns across all categories of employees and determinedly craft improved recruitment, retention and professional development strategies to increase the number and presence of African- American colleagues at all levels of the organization to keep pace with the changing demographics of Baltimore County. 7 See Table 8 for Baltimore County race population data. 8 See Table 7 for race and employment category data. 113 Commit to using our vast workforce training capacity to help improve skills training and career opportunities to the region's African-A merican communities. Foster a college climate of equity, civility, and inclusion that embraces all students, faculty, and staff across the broad spectrum of CCBC's diverse communities. Faculty and Staff Cultural Training Programs CCBC believes that faculty and staff training is an integral part of achieving student success. The Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL) serves as a focal point for faculty professional development. The center offers individual workshops, courses of study, programs, consultations, coaching and mentoring programs to assist faculty and staff in understanding cultural diversity. CETL has developed an outstanding framework for providing culturally diverse training for full and part- time faculty. CCBC's Culturally Responsive Teaching and Learning program (CRT-L) is designed to help faculty and staff develop a learning environment appropriate for a diverse student population. The CRT -L program is delivered in several different formats, designe d for different populations. The CRT-L Seminar provides 24 hours of training for participants over an 8- day period. The specific goals of this training are: (a) To develop faculty understanding of the nature of race and culture, including expressions of race and culture by the students with whom they work; (b) To positively affect faculty's interaction with students by training faculty to manage racial and cultural elements of classroom social exchange; and (c) To improve student success by developing faculty's ability to respond to cultural and racial needs and expectations of the particular students with whom they work. In addition to the CRT- L Seminar, CCBC offers a series of two -hour CRT-L Workshops. The workshop series is open to all staff but is particularly targeted to adjunct faculty. There are currently five modules in the CRT-L Workshop series: Meanings of Culture and Race, Mindsets and Culture, Overcoming Stereotype Threat, Social Capital and Learning and a newly developed module on Understanding and Combating Implicit Bias. CRT -L training is also incorporated into the annual events and conferences that faculty and staff attend during the year. CRT -L training and topic discussions are offered at many of our annual events, including Prof essional Developmental Day, Fall Focus, Developmental and General Education Symposium and the Teaching and Learning Fair. This year the CRT-L program has increased offerings to students and staff, with materials and methods designed for these different audiences. CCBC has partnered with other colleges in the state to advance culturally responsive teaching. The college has hosted the Culturally Responsive Teaching Conference for the last six years. The conference typically attracts 180- 250 participants, drawn from colleges across the country, K -12 schools and CCBC faculty and staff. In 2018 a new element was added to the CRT -L Conference, in the form of a 1- day Institute in a train -the-trainers model. Through this institute, CCBC has begun to spread the CRT -L work that we have been doing to other colleges 114and universities (and in one instance, a high school) who are interested in our model. In addition to designated workshops for students, an evening event was dedicated to their reflection on well - being. Th is included a session on \"Personal Baggage,\" an opportunity for students to share their experiences and identities , how they deal with stress, participation in contemplative and meditative practices as well as writing a communal \"I Am\" poem. The studen ts were able to connect and share vulnerability to address inequities in their communities. FY2021 Goals for Faculty and Staff Cultural Training Programs Expand support for CCBC's Culturally Responsive Teaching and Learning (CRT- L) Initiative, gradually ex panding diversity training to constituents college- wide. Offer the CRT -L Seminar to 15 previously untrained CCBC faculty and professional staff. Offer the CRT -L Workshop modules to 20 previously untrained adjunct faculty. Increase CRT -L training to CCBC student leaders and student organizations. Host the FY2021 Culturally Responsive Teaching Conference for about 250 participants drawn from throughout the country. Provide CRT- L training to J ohns Hopkins University faculty. Continue to offer the CRT- L Insti tute. The Institute will offer a day of training in the C RT concepts CCBC has developed. Curricular Initiatives Promoting Cultural Diversity A few years ago, CCBC reviewed and revised its General Education program to include local and global diversity among the seven General Education goals. General Education course curricula are now required to help students develop knowledge and skills to pa rticipate effectively in evolving multicultural contexts and to address the challenges in building just, equitable, and productive societies. The Global Education program promotes inclusion of global and cultural awareness into the curriculum. FY2021 Goa ls for Curricular Initiatives Promoting Cultural Diversity Increase Global Education certificate enrollment to 30 new students. Increase short -term study abroad programs and opportunities for students to experience the world. Continue to support faculty travel abroad through Faculty International Travel (FIT) grants, so that faculty may enhance the global nature of their classes. Programs for Retaining Students Community colleges are often the initial higher education experience for first generat ion college students, students from disadvantaged economic backgrounds, students not prepared for college level coursework, and non-native English speakers. CCBC recognizes that many students are at risk of not achieving their academic potential and has therefore developed programs designed to recruit and retain students to ensure they achieve their goals. 115CCBC's Male Student Success Initiative (MSSI) is intended to increase the retention rate and improve the academic standing of male students at CCBC, primarily students of color and athletes. Services include proactive academic support, the development of emotional maturity and social skills, training in financial literacy, and referral to resources in and outside the college. The MSSI extends CCBC's ex isting high -impact practices to include skill-building workshops, study hall and collaborative activities, intrusive academic advising and mentoring to support male students. As part of MSSI, CCBC has continued to expand its student orientation course, Ac ademic Development: Transitioning to College (ACDV101), with sections contextualized for men of color. These ACDV101 sections are facilitated by faculty who have completed the Culturally Responsive Teaching (CRT -L) professional development training. Toget her, ACDV- MSSI form a comprehensive program that consists of the culturally relevant student success course, mentorship and academic coaching, and various academic and professional activities designed to bolster the academic success of students of color. C CBC partnered with MDRC , a nonprofit, nonpartisan education and social policy research organization, through the Men of Color College Achievement (MoCCA) Demonstration Project to refine and evaluate the efficacy of the ACDV 101 contextualized course and the Male Student Success Initiative (ACDV -MSSI). The MoCCA study of ACDV -MSSI is supported by the Institute of Education Sciences, U.S. Department of Education, and study results will provide evidence on what programs might best support persistence and degree completion for men of color. FY2021 Goals for Programs for Retaining Students Refine and evaluate ACDV 101 for Male Students of Color and the Male Student Success Initiative (ACDV -MSSI) in conjunction with MDRC Men of Color College Achievement Project ( MoCCA) Collaborate with Baltimore County Public Schools to deliver a Pathways in Technology (PTECH) Early College High School at Dundalk High School and to establish a new P-T ECH at Owings Mills High School Design a Diversity Scorecard to create data- drive n solutions to narrow achievement gaps, and measure the impact of specific strategies and progress toward reducing inequities for at -risk students. Cultural Diversity and Campus Life Programs at CCBC Within the Office of College Life, the Student Life Office and the Office of Intercultural Engagement (OIE) are responsible for promoting diversity outside the classroom, cultivating cultural awareness and appreciation for diversity, increasing access and equity for historically underrepresented groups and improving CCBC's educational climate as an inclusive and collaborative community. The Student Life O ffice and the Office of Intercultural Engagement offer academic, social, and cultural support and programs for the entire college community. CCBC does this through programs, annual events, speaker series, book discussions, college sponsored clubs and organizations and other activities. The Office of Intercultural Engagement serves as chair of the CCBC Hate/Bias Incident Response Team commissioned by the Maryland Higher Education C ommission (MHEC) to provide instruction and training of the student body, faculty, and staff to enhance cultural 116diversity programming and sensitivity. The team has developed a plan for the next two years, beginning with Restorative Practices T raining during year one. The training provided practical skills to equip students, faculty and staff with the ability to facilitate and participate in difficult conversations, promote and encourage civility in classrooms and community settings, and identify practices that can be incorporated on a broader scale in offices and departments, such as Human Resources, Office of Student Conduct and Department of Public Safety. CCBC sponsors a range of programs that facilitate conversation among students, faculty, staff and the community on issues important to cultural diversity. The Office of Intercultural Engagement has developed Mosaic Talks which are offered as in and out of class seminars, workshops, and presentations to build awareness, appreciation, and allyship to diverse student populations and communities. Topics range from religious diversity, microaggressions, language variances and codeswitching, LGBT Q concerns, white privilege and intersectionality. To help students adjust to life on a college campus, the Student Life o ffice has developed the Civility Campaign. As part of this campaign, all first-year students in the Student O rientation course are shown videos to help them understand how to interact with others on campus. The college also uses a website, Lessons on Civility, Culture and Race, for students to learn about their own cultural values and how those values influence points of view and interactions with others. Through the Spotlight Speaker Series , CCBC invites to our campuses speakers who raise awareness about a wide range of topics, present various perspectives and promote values clarification. CCBC incorporates many awareness events in to its annual calendar , including Black History Month in February; National Disability Awareness month in October; and International Education Week in November . CCBC also celebrates National Hispanic Heritage Month, National Women's History Month, Gay and Lesbian History Month and Native American Heritage Month. CCBC sponsors a college-wide book discussion e very year through the Community Book Connection (CBC), open to students, faculty and staff. The goals of this interdisciplinary literacy program are to e nhance student and community learning, to strengthen our common human bonds, and to demonstrate the vital connection between classroom learning and social issues in the broader community. CCBC also promotes A lternative Spring Break programs, which offer students educational and service opportunities in and outside the country. Students interact with different cultures and gain an awareness and understanding of cross-cultural differences. Students have traveled to South Dakota, Maine, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Honduras among other locations. FY2021 Goals on Cultural Diversity and Campus Life Programs Review an appropriate staffing model for the Office of Intercultural Engagement. Continue the recruitment of faculty and staff to participate in semester long conversations on race. The book Courageous Conversations About Race: A Field Guide for Achieving Equity in Schools by Glenn Singleton will continue to be used as the teaching gui de. Increase the number of students attending the orientation program which includes training on civility to help students understand how to interact with others on campus. 117Celebrate and program events for Black History Month, National Disability Awareness month, International Education Week, National Hispanic Heritage Month, National Women's History Month, Gay and Lesbian History Month and Native American Heritage Month.

Provide programming to support the Community Book Connection for FY2020-2021: The Truth About Stories, A Native Narrative by Thomas King . Special Services for Diverse or Unique Student Populations The Enrollment and Student Services division provides support for special student populations. These contextualized services increase access and equity for historically underrepresented groups and improve CCBC's educational climate as an inclusive and civi l community. Students with Disabilities CCBC is committed to the philosophy of non- discrimination for individuals with disabilities. The Office of Disability Support Services (DSS) assists students with disabilities so they have an equal opportunity to participate in all of our programs, events, activities and services. Among the services provided are sign language interpreters, accommodated testing and note takers. Services are available to both credit and non -credit students. DSS also verifies that the college is in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and all other regulatory requirements involving students with disabilities . Disability Support Services participates in the Workforce Recruitment Program (WRP) , which provides an opportunity for students and recent graduates to submit a resume and participate in job interview s with public and private sector employers. The results of all the interviews are assembled into a database that is shared with employers to help students with disabilities to find an internships or permanent employment. Disability Support Services coordinates with the Career Services center t o complement the work done by the W orkforce Recruitment Program. The Gamma Beta Chapter of the Delta Alpha Pi International Honor Society was established at CCBC in 2013. Membership in Delta Alpha Pi is by invitation only for those students that self-identify as having a disability and meet the following academic crite ria: 24 completed college credits and a GPA of 3.10 or higher. Members of Delta Alpha Pi serve as role models for other students with disabilities. Disability Support Services (DSS) provides training to our faculty and staff on how to improve accessibilit y and create an inclusive environment for students with disabilities. These training 118sessions are held during our annual Fall Focus and Teaching and Learning Fair. DSS works with each department to discuss disability issues to address the unique needs, experiences and challenges they may have in meeting the needs of students with disabilities. Training for our public safety officers on working with students with disabilities was added in 2018. National Disability Awareness Month, held in October, is a nati onal awareness campaign with the goal of educating the public about disability issues and celebrating the many contributions of people with disabilities. CCBC holds events on our campuses to promote awareness for faculty and credit and non-credit students. LGBTQ Students CCBC establishe d the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning + (LGBTQ+) Online Resource Center to support the college's LGBTQ population. The Online Resource c enter includes resources at CCBC and links to national organizations. Efforts to support LGBTQ students are coordinated through the Office of Intercultural Engagement and the Sexual Minorities Advocacy Committee. The mission of the CCBC Sexual Minorities Advocacy Committee (SMAC) is to promote awareness of LGBTQ issues, and to provide strategies, methods, and educational opportunities to the CCBC community in order to create an inclusive, welcoming and supportive environment. This year, members of SMAC partnered with representatives from the School of Continuing Education to ensure that LGBTQ support services are also available to non-credit students. Each campus has staff available for LGBTQ students to turn to for help. CCBC sponsors Proudly Rallying behind the Intersectionality of Social Minorities ( PRISM), a student organization for LGBQT students. CCBC has a Preferred Name policy, available to students and staff. The preferred name is used in most places except where the use of a legal name is required. International Students International students are supported through the International Student Services Office (ISS). Services include help with applying to CCBC, college level assessment and placement testing , and assistance in maintaining visa requirements. International Student Services also helps students adjust to life in the Baltimore area with resources on finding housing and transportation. International students can also find support with student organizations, such as the African Student Union, International Student Association and the Muslim Student Association. CCBC hosts events during International Education Week to recognize international students, education abroad, and internationalization.

Sexual Misconduct Prevention CCBC is committed to maintaining a learning and working environment for students, faculty, and staff that is free of sexual misconduct and harassment . Sexual misconduct is contrary to the standards of the college community and is a barrier to fulfilling the college's academic mission. Education and awareness are essential to CCBC's efforts against sexual misconduct, including sexual assault, and the college provides educational materials and programs. Education efforts include the on-going discussion of the sexual misconduct policy and an understanding of what constitutes sexual misconduct , procedures for addressing alleged sexual misconduct, and methods for prevention of sexual misconduct. Ongoing educational programs are also held for faculty, staff, and students. Increasing the Diversity of CCBC's Employees CCBC recognizes the value of a diverse work force that is reflective of our students and of the community it serves . The college is committed to welcoming, respecting, and embracing the differences and similarities of employees and students. Each member of the college community is responsible and held accountable for fostering a climate of acceptan ce, inclusion, respect, and dignity of all persons. CCBC is committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination and harassment of any nature including, but not limited to, racial, religious, sexual orientation, age, gender, national origin , ancestry, veteran status, disability, or any other type of harassment. Harassment is unwanted verbal, physical, or visual conduct relating to an individual's race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, national origin, ancestry, veteran status, or disability. All employees are required to attend Sexual Misconduct Prevention Training annually. Training for supervisors, including New Manager Orientation, provides instruction in non-discriminatory human resources practices, procedures and policies. Ong oing leadership development provides an opportunity for faculty and staff with supervisory responsibility to strengthen their competence in managing a diverse workforce. Workshops include topics aimed at managing a multi-generational workforce, conducting equitable internal investigations, maintaining a respectful workplace & civility, managing difficult conversations, combatting implicit bias, and understanding the meaning of culture and race. The President's Leadership Academy, a training program for fut ure CCBC leaders, also includes sessions on Human Resources policies and procedures and CCBC's commitment to a diverse workplace. In FY2017, the Human Resources Office developed a process to obtain more detailed information from employees and job applicants with disabilities and those who are veterans of the U.S. military. Search committees are required to document that the review of applicants, selection of candidates and candidate interviews were conducted in a non- discriminatory manner. CCBC proactively took steps to remove barriers to employment for qualified workers with 120criminal records, specifically by removing the criminal conviction history question from the job application \u2014a reform co mmonly known as \"ban the box.\" Withi n the Human Resources Department , there are Employee Relations/Equity partners assigned to each of the college's administrative units dedicated to work with employees to address workplace conflict and to assure that any complaints of discrimination or unfair treatment are inves tigated and addressed. Policies and procedures for reporting any issues are included in the employee handbook and are also included on the CCBC employee website. FY2021 Goals on Increasing the Diversity of CCBC's Employees Analyze and repurpose CCBC's hiring practices as appropriate to revised goals based on Baltimore County demographics. Provide sexual misconduct prevention training to all employees. Monitor compliance with the annual training requirement. Provide search specialist training for CCBC staff. Train 10 more search specialists. Assure recruitment outreach to diverse populations by advertising available positions in a wide range of venues including Monster.com, Military.com, Hire Disability Solutions, Maryland Workforce Exchange, Department of Veterans Affairs, Local Universities and Community Colleges, Diverseeducation.com, Diversity Jobs.com, HBCU Connect Network, Hispanic Outlook, Latin Opinion, Afro- American, and Higher Education Research Consortium. SECTION IV. INCREASING THE DIVERSITY OF FACULTY AND STAFF CCBC is committed to ensuring equal opportunity and non- discrimination in all of its hiring and employment practices and has policies and procedures in place to ensure that search and hiring practices promote a diverse workforce. The diversity of our employees is regularly reviewed and strategies have been developed to address underutilization of minorities as well as other underrepresented groups . A strategy that has proven somewhat effective in increasing the diversity of faculty and staff at CCBC has been to broaden candidate pools and expand outreach and a dvertising . CCBC has developed and strengthened policies and procedures to ensure that positions are advertised in a wide variety of publications and media outlets, and that notices of openings are in traditional and non-traditional forums, including college sponsored job fairs and job fairs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU's). We pay particular attention to the language used in our recruitment efforts to be sure we are inclusive and appealing to those with different backgrounds and experiences. Additionally, we have found that it is important to recruit early for positions. O ur measureable diversity increases have been modest, but along with expanding advertising CCBC is also strengthening the diversity and inclusion training of members of its search committees to reduce bias in the candidate selection process. 121SECTION V. CAMPUS PROCESS FOR THE REPORTING OF HATE -BASED CRIMES Reporting incidences of hate crimes are addressed under the Jeanne Cleary Disclosure of Campus Crime Statistics Act (Cleary Act) as amended by the Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA). At CCBC, t he Department of Public Safety (DPS) works to create and maintain a secure campus climate and to protect personal and college assets. All public safety information required by the Jeanne Clea ry Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act may be found on the Public Safety website at http://www.ccbcmd.edu/Campus- Life-and-Activities/Public - Safety.aspx . Officers investigate and report all crimes and inciden ts that come to their attention. CCBC's Public S afety staff also works closely with the Baltimore County Police Department and will ask for its assistance when needed or when requested by a victim of a crime. The D epartment of Public S afety and Baltimore County Police Department work cooperatively under a Memorandum of Understanding that specifies roles and responsibilities for both agencies. Each Public S afety officer receives 16 hours of in-service training annually, which is four times the number of hours mandated by the S tate of Maryland. Officers are trained in offense definition, report classification and criminal investigation. Officers are routinely updated on changes to county, state and federal law, and receive periodic training on sexual assault, hate and bias crimes, dating and domestic violence, stalking and harassment. The Department of Public Safety is staffed by full and part- time uniformed public safety officers 24 hours a day. Each full- time public safety officer is commissioned by the state of Maryland as a Special Police Officer and has full police powers (including powers of arrest) through the statutory and common law of Maryland. The college provides timely security alerts to the college community regarding offense s or incidents that are reported to campus Public Safety offices, college administrators or local police, and which may represent a threat to students and employees, through Campus Alert, CCBC e-mail, voice mail, and text messaging. Students, faculty, and staff are automatically placed in the alert database when they register for a course, or receive a paycheck from the college. Family and community members may opt-in to Campus Alert. College policy dictates that all crimes or emergencies be reported direct ly to the Department of Public Safety by calling 443-840-1111. A report may also be made to any college employee (known as a Campus Security Authority) who has a significant interest in student safety, such as a faculty member, dean or director, coach, ad visor or other campus official. Any college member who is a victim of a serious crime is also encouraged to report the incident to the Baltimore County Police Department by calling 911 (for emergencies). The Department of Public Safety will investigate a nd document all crimes in accordance with college policy. 122Table 1a - Race Trends for All Students FY2015 FY2016 FY2017 FY2018 FY2019 Race Count % Count % Count % Count % Count % African 0.3% 195 0.3% 220 0.4% Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander 113 0.2% 114 0.2% 110 0.2% FY2016 FY2017 FY2018 FY2019 Gender Count % Count % Count % Count % Count % annual fiscal year enrollment files.

Since 1957, as the Frederick County Schools began to racially integrate, FCC has prepared an increasingly diverse student body to complete their goals of workforce preparatio n, transfer, career development, and personal enrichment . FCC is a mid -sized institution with close to 9,000 credit students and 6,000 continuing education and workforce development students per y ear. FCC has a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) infrastructure that includes: the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion with a senior diversity officer, the President's Diversity Advisory Council, Multicultural Student Services, Adult Services, Veteran and Military Services, Disability and Access Services , Adult Education and English as a Second Language Programs, as well as other student -centered and employee -centered programs. FCC's cultural diversity work is grounded in our College -wide 2019 -2024 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Strategic Plan. DEFINING DIVERSITY In 2020 -2021, as part of a Strategic Annual Priority around ensuring racial equity from the Board of Trustees, FCC defined (or redefined) multiple diversity, equity, and inclu sion terms for the College. As requested, t he current working definition of diversity at FCC is : \"All the characteristics and ways in which individuals and groups differ from one another, including but not limited to dimensions of identity and background i ncluding age, dis/ability, education, ethnicity, gender, race, immigration status, national origin, citizenship, language, marital status, parental status, religion, sexuality, socioeconomic status, veteran/military status. To make a community a place where diverse individuals and groups can thrive, diversity needs to engage a set of active and conscious practices that go beyond acknowledging and/or tolerating difference. Diversity relies on equity and inclusion , among other practices, to achieve access and success for all individuals and groups.\" This definition was the result of reviewing multiple formal and informal definitions of diversity, reviewing definitions used by other institutions and organizations, as well as the result of a group of faculty and staff discussions. This definition, among others, will be reviewed by the President's Diversity Advisory Council in Fall 2021 as well as by students as part of the process of adopting this definion. In defining all terms, we seek to have definitions that allow our students, faculty, and staff to strengthen their understandings of interactions across difference, both in terms of theory and practice. MOST SUCCESSFUL NEW & ONGOING INSTITUTIONAL INITIATIVES AND HOW THEY ARE ASSESSED Below we have focused on the newer initiatives at FCC and how they are being assessed. In addition to these newer initiatives listed below, we have ongoing initiatives that have been successful as well including: 1) Multicultural Student Services which offers culturally responsive advising, a first year comprehensive support program, and sociocultural communities, programming, and scholarships for marginalized student populations; 2) Adult Services, Vete ran and Military Services, Disability and Access Services, and Parents Lead which offer culturally responsive advising and programming for specific, targeted student populations who may experience barriers in terms of access or success at FCC . We use insti tutional success data by racial/ethnic group to determine the success of any or all interventions for students. FCC Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Strategic Plan 2019 -2024 and FCC Institutional Racial Equity Plan 2021 -2027: These strategic institutional plans have accountability leaders, benchmarks, and assessment tools to determine if the College has met its goals around supporting access and success for specific student p opulations, faculty, and staff. The plans also focus on institutional climate/culture shifts to make FCC a place where diverse 142populations are clear that they belong and can thrive. As an example as part of the Equity plan, during the 2020 - 2021 and 2021 -2022 academic years, all credit and non -credit programs are reviewing their access and/or success data by demographics and instituting interventions to address any equity gaps in access or success. There is extensive professional development to support the a dministrators and faculty leadership who are leading this charge as well as institutional funds to support these interventions to make sure there are no equity gaps at FCC. Implicit Bias Training for Search Chairs and Search Committees and 19% Racial/Ethn ic Minority Applicants : Improvements have been, and continue to be made, with respect to recruiting racially diverse faculty and staff. The following FCC interventions are supported by literature and reseach around diversifying hiring. These include an emp hasis on: 1) recruiting a diverse applicant pool with a consistent process; 2) requiring annual Search Chair training on how to reduce implicit bias in searches and implicit bias training for all committee members; and 3) assigning diverse representation to search committees and , 4) writing interview questions which communicate our institutional comm itment to diversity and how diversity, equity, and inclusion are central to all work at the College. Human Resources reviews racial diversity beginning with applicants from the initial pool through first round screening to ensure the minimum requirements d o not adversely impact applicants. Before Search Committees do an initial screening of candidates, HR reviews the pool for a goal of 19% racial/ethnic minority representation. If the goal has not been met, the Senior Leader for the area needs to approve th at the search can still move forward without further recruitment to diversify the applicant pool. In FY 21, the College conducted 90 searches and only five of those searches did not meet the 19% threshold for diverse applicant pool by the best consideratio n date. All five searches had their best consideration dates extended, at which point Human Resources continued recruitment. At the end of the new extended date, three of those remaining five searches met the 19% goal. The remaining two searches have not y et met their new best consideration date, so their outcome cannot yet be determined. In summary, 97% of the Colleges searches had an applicant pool that was racially diverse at 19% or higher. In FY22, we will continue to review the diversity of the applica nt pool. Developmental Reform in Math and English: The FCC developmental math and English programming has undergone considerable reform. This initiative directly affects minority and first -generation students, as FCC data and national trends indicate tha t these groups are often disproportionately impacted by developmental education. As of fall 2017, developmental English courses were condensed from a four (4) -course sequence to a single class of either four (4) or six (6) credits, enabling students to mov e into college level English in only one semester, and with fewer credits. This was accompanied by a review of College pre and co -requisites with the goal of expanding the number of courses students can take while completing developmental English. Developm ental math as a series of stand -alone developmental courses has been almost entirely eliminated. The overwhelming majority of FCC students testing into developmental math now take one of three college level math courses, while simultaneously enrolled in a two (2) credit developmental supplement. Additionally, in 2020, FCC added a S tudent Outreach and Retention Coordinator in Math, and is adding S tudent Outreach and Retention Coordinator s in Engl ish and Health programs in 2021. These faculty administrators support students in being successful in their math, English, and/or Health (nursing, surgical tech, respiratory therapy) courses. These are subject -matter experts who support students in getting the tutoring, additional advising/counseling they need to be successful in these courses. Culturally Responsive Teaching Scholars: In 2021, we have identified 16 Culturally Responsive Teaching Scholars across every academic area of the College (including both credit and non -credit workforce development programs as well as online learning and the libraries) who are receiving a year of professional development and supporting the faculty/staff in their areas in being culturally conscious, responsiv e, and relevant. The Scholars will commit to a Summer Ins titute and ongoing development during fall 2021 and spring 2022. These Scholars will, in conjunction with the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and the Center for Teaching and Learning, support their departments in strengthening equitable teaching practices as well as culturally conscious and responsive curriculum and teaching throughout the College. 143 Professional Development with a focus on Leadership Development: Over 800 faculty, staff, and students participated in professional and personal development sessions focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion over the past year. In addition, 120 faculty a nd administrators attended a three -day leadership conference in January to support the development of equity -minded leadership , titled \"L eading for Racial Equity.\" Ses sions were facilit ated by faculty and staff as well as external experts Rev. Dr . Jamie W ashington, Dr. Denise Rollins , and Dr. Carlton Green. COVID -19 Impact on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion COVID -19 has impacted our enrollment numbers , especially of our African American/Black, Latino/a/x, and Native American student populations. In addition to impacting access for our Students of Color , COVID -19 has also impacted success rates of students. While offering online courses supported student s' work -school -life balance in many unexpected ways, it was also difficult for students to juggle an all -online course load . COVID increased our racial equity gaps in both access and success -- and therefore retention and success rates for marginalized/minoritized students -- and had an impact on student learning , retention, and success . While the College did provide computer devices to students who needed them, our lower income students often did not have access to reliable internet se rvice, were expected to work more or longer shifts (in frontline worker jobs), and/or had children who were also enrolled in online school. Anecdotally, non -traditionally aged students also named they wanted to delay enrollment until in -person classes star ted again. During the C OVID -19 pandemic we did have (as mentioned above) excellent attendance at diversity programming at the College and powerful programs about equity, justice, and inclusion. Students were able to view some of the programming afterward s, as technology allowed for asynchronous viewing. Unquestionably, this additional access to programming to strengthen inter - and cross -cultural awareness, knowledge, and skills is important for our students' short term and long term success in our communi ty, in the workplace, and world. Future Focus FCC is proud of the work accomplished in 2020 -2021 , especially given the impact of C OVID -19 in the community and the world , and will continue building and sustaining a diverse and engaged College community through multiple innovative initiatives . A few of the future priorities , all central to the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Strategic Plan, include: Strengthe ning and implem enting both the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Strategic Plan 2019 -2024 as well as the College's plan to close racial equity gaps in access and success by 202 7. Reviewing processes for recruitment and hiring to get to and exceed benchmark s for hiring and retaining faculty and staff who are People of Color. Reviewing and strengthening culturally responsive teaching across the College as well as in courses that explicitly se ek to build student capacity to interact across difference. Developing professional development paths for faculty and staff around racial equity. Strengthening the campus climate to become even more welcoming and inclusive. The College continues to make deliberate efforts to be intentional in its work of threading diversity, equity, and inclusion into the fabric of the culture of the College and all its activities , and making FCC a place where racial/ethnic minorit ized students , faculty, and staff thrive.

Need more specific metrics for this action item. 1502021 Garrett College Plan for Program of Cultural Diversity Draft Narrative 1.Definition of diversity and how institution developed that definition (no more than one page) . Garrett College's introductory trainings into diversity, equity and inclusion combine two dictionary definitions of \"diversity\". In the Merriam -Webster (online) dictionary, diversity is defined as the \"inclusion of different types of people (as people of different races, ethnicities or cultures) in a group or organization \". Dictionary.com defines diversity as \"the inclusion of individuals representing more than one national origin, color, religion, socioeconomic stratum, sexual orientation, etc .\". As a community college, we understand that diversity i s comprised of much more than race and ethnicity; it consists of so much more that makes unique individuals . In the college's policy on nondiscrimination, the protected categories that also illustrate the dimensions of diversity includes, but is not limite d to, Race, Religion, Personal appearance, Color, Sex, Pregnancy, Political affiliation, Source of income, Creed, Ethnicity, National origin (including ancestry), Citizenship status,Physical or mental disability (including perceived disabilit y), Age, Marital status, Family responsibilities, Sexual orientation, Gender identity, Gender expression, Veteran or military status, Predisposing genetic characteristics, And other protected categories. In trainings and conversations, we ask participants how they would define diversity to illicit community feedback. During student exercises, particularly one entitled \"Walk Apart, Walk Together\", we have students name differences between two participants and for each difference, they ta ke a step apart. Then we have the audience call out similarities, and for each, the participants take a step toward each other. Then we lead the students in a discussion about the differences and the things that are easy to see, and the similarities, which might not be physical/visible, but can be learned in getting to know someone. This activity helps individuals recognize differences and similarities , highlights the importance of acceptance and welcoming individuals into the campus community , and demonstr ates the college's definition and support of diversity . 1512. Most successful ongoing and new institutional initiatives related to cultural diversity and how efficacy is measured (no more than one page) . With t he COVID pandemic and societal events/ issues of the past year and a half, the college recognized that there were many challenges present in how we would carry out previously identified initiatives , as outlined in the College's 2020 -2021 Cultural Diversity Plan ( see Appendix) , and if those initiatives were relevant at the time. With all campus activities taking place in the virtual realm, there was little the college could do activity -wise . Participation for in -person events is consistently low, so it was believed that virtual participation would be as challenging. College leadership decided to use the 2020 -2021 school year to gather information and begin to establish new community partnerships. During July and August of 2020, the College dissemi nated a survey to the campus community, entitled \"Current Realities\" survey. The intent of the survey was to solicit the insight of faculty, staff, and students to support the college's mission of creating inclusive and equitable pathways to success. The premise of the survey was in relation to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) , but a majority of the responses received were focused on the COVID -19 pandemic. Fifteen responses received did have a focus on racial equity and the social climate and provide the college with direction to address these concerns. A few individuals provided contact information and a willingness to participate in further conversations around the campus climate. This information helped the college draft and disseminate its \"Diversi ty, Equity and Inclusion at Garrett College\" statement, and will be used to work on creating a DEI Council, a long -time goal of the College's Cultural Diversity Plan. Additionally, Garrett County community members have taken the initiative to create a NAA CP chapter in Garrett County and have reached out to discuss ways in which they can assist and support the College and its students. This is a very early conversations since the chapter was just approved in early 2021, but discussion of a potential mentori ng program is underway. 152 3. Ways in which institution anticipates COVID affecting (negatively/positively) efforts to enhance diversity (no more than one page) . The COVID -19 2020 -2021 school year presented a challenge for Garrett College. Garrett College's identity is built on being a small community college with a personal touch; however, COVID - 19 restrictions and lack of or decreased on -campus learning, activities and support have resulted in limited opportunities for student engagement. Our enrollment is primarily based on first-generation students, and virtual high school has prevented the motivational impact of high school guidance counselors and admissions' recruitment. Due to limited on -campus activities, connectedness to advisors, p rofessors, and peers is lacking. Our international student attendance was impacted due to travel restrictions , and while international applications have increased since spring 2020, international students will continue to face barriers in scheduling visa appointments and arranging travel. In the spring of 2020, the college had to quickly transition to a virtual platform to finish out the semester, and had only a few months to transition many formally in -person offerings into various modalities for the fal l 2020 and spring 2021 semesters. Limited student access to and previous experience with technology created barriers for students in the quick transition. Recent studies suggest that higher education should anticipate a decrease in African American male s tudents. Additionally, studies have shown that more students are questioning the value of higher education and there is widespread uncertainty due to students' personal lives and circumstances. Our recent graduation survey indicated potential barriers to completion, such as: childcare, online coursework (without an in -person option), technology, time management, COVID -19 restrictions, and finances. Additionally, because we reduced the capacity in our residential halls, the diversity of our student populat ion was lower than in pre -COVID semesters. Many out -of-area students chose to learn from home due to health and safety -related concerns, which also had an impact on the residence halls. On a positive note, because we were able to keep our residential hall s open during COVID and run a successful Athletic program in the spring 2021 semester, we believe that our students were given a more normal college experience during a challenging time. As a result of COVID -19, our modalities have improved, which expands the capacity for students in any location to enroll and the ways in which professors can provide instruction. 153154I. INTRODUCTION: The role and importance of diversity in higher education has been widely recognized. In 2008, the Maryland General Assembly affirmed the importance of diversity as an educational goal by enacting legislation requiring that every public college and university develop and implement a cultural diversity plan. The 2008 l egislation defines \"cultural diversity\" to mean \"the inclusion of those racial and ethnic groups and individuals that are or have been under -represented in high er education.\" The 2013 -2017 Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education subsequently broaden ed the definition of diversity to also include age, cultural identity, disability, family educational history, gender identity and expression, nationality, se xual orientation, religious affiliation, sex, and socio -economic status. The 2017 -2021 Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education: Student Success with Less Debt focuses on diversity in Strategy 4 : \"Enhance diversity by fostering collaborations betw een Historically Black Colleges and Universities and traditionally white institutions \". Garrett College is committed to achieving a culturally diverse student body, faculty, and staff, and a campus environment that values and actively supports diversity , equity and inclusion . The College also strives to ensure that its graduating students are adequately prepared to live and work in a global society comprised of diverse cultures and beliefs. This commitment to diversity is evidenced in a variety of ways , including the College's Mission Statement and Institutional Goals , its Strategic Plan, its recruitment practices, and its goals for general education , student development , and the campus environment. II. CULTURAL DIVERSITY IMPROVEMENT PLAN : As this report will show, Garrett College has made significant progress toward achieving diversity among its student body, infusing diversity into the curriculum, and creating a campus climate that respects differences and values diversity. At the January 2018 All -College Forum, Garrett College added a new concluding sentence to its mission statement, \"The College respects and cares for students as individuals and as members of diverse groups, and supports their aspirations for a better life \", to illustrate the College's dedication to making improvements as it relates to cultural diversity at the institution. As a result of the August 2018 Prince George's Community College team visit and their subsequent February 2019 comprehensive report , two set s of recommendations respectively dealing with employee and student engagement were made . This report was shared with key personnel who subsequently 1.) identified high -priority recommendations for fast -track implementation and 2.) provided input regardin g improvements made prior to receiving the PGCC report that proactively addressed various recommendations. This team developed a consensus regarding both Employee and Student Engagement priorities, as well as suggested strategie s to implement those priorit ies. The College's FY21 -FY25 Strategic Plan has been restructured and removed the initiatives that had previously closely aligned with this plan. Despite the changes, addressing the needs and experiences of a diverse student population is still the drivin g force of the Strategic Plan and the College's Diversity plan will continue to support more efficient and effective practices toward diversity, equity, and inclusion at Garrett College. The College is utilizing Taskstream to monitor plan impl ementation, r esponsibility, development , and effectiveness . Goals and Strategies for Improving Cultur al Diversity: Goal 1: To coordinate initiatives for diversity, equity, and inclusion . Strategy 1 : Create an Office of Diversity with specific expectations (college and greater community) . Responsibility : President Timeline : On-going Desired Outcome : Designate an individual on campus who will coordinate and oversee diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. 155Measures : Student Opinion survey; climate survey; office data/statistics Status : Complete ; The Director of Equity and Compliance was selected to serve as the College's Diversity Officer in the spring of 2019 . The Diversity Officer is tasked to cultivate a work and learning environment that encourages and supports diversity and inclusion. The College is developing a survey to send to faculty, staff, and current and graduate students regarding responses to current realities around racial equity in today's society. Responses will be assessed and small focus groups developed to guide further actions. Next steps will include con tinued plan development and actions with key stakeholders in the college. Strategy 2 : Create a Council for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion to ensure active engagement . Responsibility : President, Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Equity & Compliance Timeline : Summer 20 20- Research best practices for recruiting student pa rticipants and council guidance; Fall 20 20- Advertise and recruit; Fall 20 20- Spring 202 1- Develop council goals, plan activities/events . Desired Outcome : Develop a plan and advertise among students to start a Council for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. This group of individuals , along with faculty and staff, will help guide efforts for active student engagement around the initiatives developed from this plan . Measures : Student survey s; post -activity/event feedback Status : Currently in the planning and research stage. Part of the duties of this Council will be to assist in developing ways to address those areas where improvement is needed on campus and have a pool of diverse students who can represent the student body and provide first -hand knowledge of potential barri ers to success and satisfaction. Completion of this strategy may be impacted by the college's fall operational status in response to the COVID -19 pandemic. Goal 2 : To increase opportunities for employee engagement around the topics of d iversity, equity, and inclusion (Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2) . Strategy 1: Develop/acquire/deliver continued workplace cultural competency and humility education . Responsibility : Director of Equity & Compliance Timeline : On-going Desired Outcome : At least 80% of th e full -time faculty and staff will be able to demonstrate intercultural communication skills by articulating a respect for cultural differences and similarities and demonstrate the ability to respond appropriately in dealing with problem situations. Measures : Employee completion numbers, quiz statistics Status : In progress . In an effort to i ncrease the knowledge base of employees and provide a basic understanding of concepts under the diversity, equity, and inclusion umbrella, an Introduction to Diversity , Cultural Competency, and Social Justice was released to employees in April 2019 as part of the Employee Compliance Training through Blackboard. By June 2019, 100% of full -time faculty, staff, and head coaches have completed the program . Foundationa l course completion is required of all incoming employees. The Diversity Officer plans on developing regular trainings on topics related to diversity, equity, and inclusion that will be made available to employees through the Employee Compliance Training. Future subject matter includes generational communication styles that will address concerns that arose from the Student Experience Committee's report and were referenced in the 2018 and 2019 report s. Strategy 2 : Bring faculty, staff, students, and guest lecturers together for cultural diversity discussions, employing local and regional resources. Responsibility : Dean of Academic Affairs, Dean of Student Affairs 156Timeline : Develop as part of the activities calendar; will be on-going as these types of events should be held (or attended if held at another institution) on a regular basis. Desired Outcome : Two events and/or discussions held by December 2020. Measures : Number of events and/ or discussions held ; evaluations. Status : In progress; In February 20 20, the College held a Black History Month Program Series. Two speakers from W est Virginia University came to campus ; participation was very low. In March 2020, the College held a Safe Zone training on campus and 4 students and 12 staff members participated; was very well received by participants. This topic is especially critical in these present times and will be a top priority to address in the 2020 -2021 school year. Strategy 3 : Host roundtable discussions on diversity, equity, and inclusion . Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Equity & Compliance Timeline : FY20-FY21 Desired Outcome : At least one roundtable, either external as part of the MD Community College Diversity Roundtable group or an internal, held by May 202 1. Measures : Number of roundtable discussions held; feedback from participants Status : This is currently in the planning stages. The College virtually host ed the MD Community College Divers ity Roundtable in June with a focus on racial injustice and the impact of COVID -19 on campuses . The College would like to have its Council on Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion created and running so these individuals can participate in these conversations in the future . Goal 3: To identify obstacles to student success and establish a network of support services that will help students to overcome them. (Strategic Plan Goal 2, Objective 2 ). Strategy 1: Create a \"safe space\" program. (Note: \"safe spaces\" refer to places created for individuals who feel marginalized to come together, and may also indicate a faculty member who does not tolerate violence, harassment or hate speech, thereby creating a safe place for all people (Waldman, Katy -2015)). Responsibi lity: Dean of Academic Affairs, Dean of Student Affairs Timeline : Summer 2019 - Develop plan; hold at least one training if possible. Desired Outcome : Identify and train f ive t o ten college employees and advertise the \"safe space s\" across campus . Measures : Biannual S tudent Opinion Survey; collect statistics on designated \"safe spaces\" and if they are utilized. Status : Completed, on -going. Two employees, one faculty and one staff, have been trained as certified instructors. One staff member left, so the rem aining staff member and the faculty member will develop a training plan and implement in the 2019 -2020 school year. In March 2020, a Safe Zone training was held on-campus. Four students and 12 staff members participated and it was well received. The Divers ity Officer will work with training staff to take the evaluation feedback to guide future trainings and campus programming to make the campus more inclusive and respectful of its LGBTQ+ community. Strategy 2 : Clearly articulated processes and procedures with respect to mental health support. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Student Development Timeline : Long -term; continuous Desired Outcome : Employ a mental health counselor to provide support to students in need. Measures : Student survey, demographics/statistics provided by counselor (meeting hours, students served, etc.) Status : Karl Glocker was hired in the spring 2019 semester and holds office hours on Thursdays for students. A contract for Glocker's services has been secured to provide continued services for the fall 1572020 and spring 202 1 semester s. With the COVID -19 pandemic, the college made information available to students for virtual counseling through Glocker. Based upon referral data, more programming and services related t o depression and anxiety are being explored. Strategy 3 : Explore additional opportunities to increase physical and mental health services on campus. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Student Development , Dean of CEWD Timeline : Long -term; continuous Desired Outcome : One to two new physical/mental health service partnerships formed or one to two existing partnerships expanded for the Spring 2020 semester. Measures : Student surveys, medical transport data, statistics from the Healt h Department and Mt. Laurel Status : Through the Go 4 Health group, the College already has formed partnerships with the Garrett County Health Department, Mountain Laurel Medical Center, and the Dove Center. Over the past year, some services the Health Depa rtment had offered have been discontinued. The College is working to determine if those services are needed, and if so, how to fill in the gaps. Additionally, conversations are being held as to what services may be missing and how the College can work with external resources to meet student needs. The College is examining statistics provided by the on -campus counselor to increase resources around those topics that were most often addressed in sessions, which included anxiety and depression. In response to t he COVID -19 pandemic, the College is also investigating bringing health services to campus on a permanent basis. A meet ing is scheduled with the G arrett Regional Medical Center leadership in mid -July to discuss a potential joint venture in support of a health center. Strategy 4 : Support students with transportation needs. Responsibility : Director of Student Development Timeline : Long-term, continuous. This can change with turnover or staff changes. Additionally, the need can change based upon student needs. Desired Outcome : Expand number of employees in the transportation rotation and increase publicity of the transportation offerings to address student needs (medical and a ccess to local resources). Measures : Student surveys, transportation statistics Status : On-going . For the 201 9-2020 school year, there were f our staff members on the rotation; however, the scheduled medical trips were significantly under -used in comparison to past years. For example, trips to a local medical provider were reserved every Friday , yet in the entire school year, only one trip was made . From the April 2019 Student Feedback survey, 50% of residential students stated that the transportation schedule met their needs. The College needs to assess student needs for transport and finding additional funds to cover the trips that are utilized, r ather than focusing solely on the number of drivers available at a given time. Strategy 5: Meet the needs of students in poverty. Responsibility : Dean of Academic Affairs, Dean of Student Affairs, Coordinator of Distance Learning, Director of Equity and Compliance Timeline : Long -term; continuous Desired Outcome : This particular item incorporates several actions in an effort to reduce barriers to success and address financial concerns of students in poverty. These actions include reduced textbook costs or increased OER use, establishing a \"one stop shop\" on campus, and increasing partnerships with local resources, such as Social Services. Measures : Reduction in course material costs, increased access to offices, Student Opinion survey 158Status : The Students in Need Group, or S.I.N.G. , is a group of volunteers who provide emergency assistance to students, and sponsors the Food Pantry. S.I.N.G.'s efforts continuo usly aid students in poverty; however, t he College's main focus at this time is to reduce and/or eliminate course material costs for students. Current OER efforts have saved our students over $100,000 in course material costs to date. For the fall 2019 semester, the College was able to implement the use of OER in 7 of the 13 ENG 101 sections and the ENG 252 course. On a similar note, Garrett College has signed a three -year contract with eCampus Course Material Solutions. eCampus will manage course materials through a virtual bookstore link on the Garrett College website. Purchase options can include New, Used, Rental, Digital, and / or Marketplace Price Matching. Purchases can be made using financial aid awards, credit card and / or Pay Pal. Book buy -back would be run through eCampus. Additionally , eCampus will award an annual $2000.00 textbook scholarship that will be disbursed at the College's discretion. Total student savings for the fall 2019 semester was $77,758. The savings was primarily due to the availability of used, rental, and eBook opti ons. The \"one stop shop\" implementation continues to be researched however no plan has been approved at this time. Strategy 6 : Improve access and accommodations for students with disabilities. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Disability Support Se rvices Timeline : Long -term; continuous Desired Outcome : Reduce barriers to success and increase access to education of students with disabilities. Measures : Student surveys, reported grievances Status : In the Summer of 2018, the College installed automatic door openers on seven doorways across campus to increase access to students and the greater community. Currently the College is assessing its facilities to install openers on the remaining doorways and is developing a plan to provide funding for this project over the next few years. From an April 2019 Student Feedback Survey, 86.25% of students who required an ADA accommodation stated that their needs are being met. The Disability Support Services office continues to work individually with incoming students to meet needs, as well as, external groups to determine what additional actions the College can take to improve access and accommodations . Goal 4: To provide an actively engaged and relevant college experience for our diverse student population to include credit and non -credit students. (Strategic Plan Goal 2, Obj . 2). Strategy 1: Development of a broader range of coursework, as needed . Responsibility : Assessment Team Co -Chairs Christa Bowser and Kelli Sisler Timeline : Fall 2019 and ongoing Desired Outcome : 70% of students meet objectives of the Global and Cultural Competency Assessment Measures : Student course assessments Status : The following Global and Cultural Competency Learning outcomes were assess ed for the 201 9- 2020 school year : 1. Students will demonstrate the ability to identify current global issues and problems from diverse perspectives. 2. Students will demonstrate intercul tural communication skills by exhibiting an understanding of cultural differences and similarities. 3. Students will demonstrate the ability to apply their understanding of diverse perspectives by taking action to make a positive social impact in the commu nity. 1592020 Cultural & Global Perspective Learning Outcomes Assessment Results Learning Outcome Assessment Results 1 Assessment # Students Evaluated # Students That Met Objectives % That Met Objectives Comments PSY 101 Course Embedded Writing Assignments 87 61 70% Met Objective SOC 101 Course Embedded Writing Assignments 89 74 83% Study Abroad Reflection 3 3 100% Met Objective SOC 101 Quiz 3 (not administered in Spring because of Covid -19 19 16 84% Met Objective 2 Assessment # Students Evaluated # Students That Met Objectives % That Met Objectives Comments PSY 101 Course Embedded Writing Assignments 95 80 84% Met Objective SOC 101 Course Embedded Writing Assignments 89 74 83% Met Objective 3 Assessment # Students Evaluated # Students That Met Objectives % That Met Objectives Comments PSY 101 Course Embedded Writing Assignments 75 67 89% Met Objective GEO 201 19 19 100% Met Objective Study Abroad Reflection 3 3 100% Met Objective As seen in the table above, all assessed courses met all of the outcomes and objectives. Dr. Terry Kasecamp developed a cultural competency assessment. While this assessment is still in draft form, it will be finalized and implemented as part of the FYE curriculum starting Fal l 2020. Strategy 2 : Build relationships between commuter and residential students. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Coordinator of Community Outreach Timeline : On going Desired Outcome : Increase the sense of community and understanding between the commuter and residential student populations. Measures : Attendance data, student surveys Status : Currently in the planning stages. At the start of the fall 2019 semester, t he Student Activities Manager (now Coordinator of Community Outreach) and the Director of Equity and Compliance incorporat ed a \"getting to know you\" or \"icebreaker\" type of activit y, known as \"Walk Apart, Walk Together\", among the incoming students during orientation that addressed th e differences and commonalities of the student population. If an in -person orientation is permitted (due to COVID -19) for the fall 2020 semester, t his activity will be continued the help start a conversation and continue to build relationship s between comm uter and residential students. 160Strategy 3 : Increase student engagement activities with regard to diversity, equity, and inclusion that would involve engagement with employees and the external community. Responsibility : Student Affairs, Academic Affairs, E quity & Compliance Timeline : On going , long -term Measures : Number of events held; post -event feedback Status : The College is currently in the planning stages for the 20 20-2021 school ye ar. This school year will present a challenge with the current pandemic and the need to alter campus operations for the health and safety of the community. In the 201 9-2020 school year, the College held events for Black History Month and National Coming Ou t Day to name a few ; however, participation was low. The College is examining ways to increase participation. The Library regularly does displays for Black History Month and Women's History Month but was limited in LGBTQ resources. Additional resources hav e been purchased which will increase the ability to provide increased education on diversity and inclusion topics. Strategy 4 : Improve the residential student experience. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Student Development, Residence Life Manager Timeline : On going , long -term Desired Outcome : Increased residential student retention and success Measures : Student retention rates, student opinion surveys Status : Due to the pandemic, the college was unable to complete the planned 2020 Student Opinion Survey . The College continues to make progress in the way of improving the residential student experience. One of the biggest concerns presented by residential students was related to internet speed. As a result of the 2018 Student Opinion Survey, this was addressed late fall of 2018 and 62% of residential students stated they were satisfied with the improvements (data from the April 2019 Student Feedback Survey) . The reformatted residence hall meeting model continues to be successful , and the larger meeting format resulted in better attendance and positive feedback from the students. For the opening meeting for the fall 2019 semester, 128 residents attended . Additional hall meetings held in the fall 2019 and spring 2020 semesters saw over 100 residents in attendance. Additionally, the Residence Hall Manager and student staff provided increased programming opportunities in the 20 19-2020 school year that were well received and attended. Strategy 5 : Connect out -of-town students with the Garre tt County community. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Coordinator of Community Outreach Timeline : On going , long -term Desired Outcome : Provide students with the opportunity to connect with resources in the county to gain experience and expose the Garrett County community to diverse populations and provide learning opportunities for all involved. Measures : Attendance numbers; student su rveys Status : Garrett College is working in partnership with the Garrett County Chamber of Commerce to develop various events designed to connect our out -of-area students and acclimate them to the local community, which will help foster inclusion and acceptance. Some of the planned events include: a welcome reception at one of the local businesses; tours of Garrett County that would assist students in acclimating to the area and seeing its natural beauty and all of the activities that Garrett County h as to offer; and a student fair which would provide the Chamber and the College opportunities to make out -of- area students feel welcome and to possibly consider Garrett County as a potential permanent home after graduation. The 2nd Annual Welcome Week Luncheon, sponsored by the Chamber, saw over four dozen students in attendance. The annual Trick or Treat in the Halls welcomed over 100 kids and their families from the outside community for a night of safe trick -or-treating. Addition ally, international students continue to participate in the Garrett College and Garrett County Public Schools diversity 161program initiative. The partnership strives to provide GCPS elementary school students with exposure to different cultures . Strategy 6 : Develop agreement with Thread organization. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Admissions Timeline : Finalize before Fall 2019 semester in efforts to have a small cohort start in September . Desired Outcome : Two to four students in the coh ort for Fall 2019 semester. Measures : Track cohort success; focus groups with cohort and Thread representatives. Status : Completed; on -going. The Thread organization is a mentoring organization that increases an individual student's success by teaming them with a support system and access to resources. Prospective students came to campus one weekend in July of 2019 to register and participate in a \"camp\" along with their downstate mentors and Thread administrators. The College and the Thread organization establish ed an MOU in September 2019. Two students attended the College and lived in the halls during the fall 2019 and spring 2020 semesters. The Academic and Advising Success Center is currently tracking their success, and the College periodically provides updates to Thread, upon request. Both students did not do as well as planned in the fall semester, so some additional touchpoints have been put in place by both GC and Thread. No additional Thread students enroll in the spring 2020 semester. The Director of Admissions attended a GC night at Thread in Baltimore in January and a post -high school kickoff night in February to promote GC to prospective students. Thread is very much still advocating and pushing for the GC cohort. Thread representatives met on ca mpus on March 3rd with staff/admin involved and checked in with the students. The College continues to work with Thread to support this cohort program. Strategy 7 : Create formal relationship with international student organization s to expand internationa l student population. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Admissions Timeline : Recruitment is currently taking place for a small cohort to being at the start of the Fall 2019 semester. Desired Outcome : Target of 1 -3 additional international students in Fall 2019. Work toward a plan to double international students successfully recruited for Fall 2020. Measures : Track cohort success; focus groups with the student cohort Status : In the fall 2019 semester, the College had six returning and two new international students in attendance. In order to increase our international student enrollment, the College is looking to expand that particular population. There is still ongoing discussion with LADO. Representatives from Admissions and Student Affairs is working to schedule to meet with and visit LADO to establish an MOU agreement and recruit students for fall 2020 . As far as other international recruitment, the College has become a member of the Maryland International Education Con sortium (MIEC) to utilize their recruitment resources and trainings. The College is present on the StudyMaryland.org website and MIEC does at least two large international recruitment tours each year. MIEC is also pushing legislation to change to allow for the hiring of 3rd parties to recruit internationally. Currently, Maryland is one of the only states that doesn't allow for this to happen. Strategy 8 : Improve education around adult expectations. Responsibility : Dean of Student Affairs, Director of Stude nt Development Timeline : Implemented in the 2018 -2019 school year; on -going Desired Outcome : 50% reduction in violations and 50% reduction in suspensions/removals through the expectation of improved behavior. Measures : Educational sanction program data; incident reports, sanction data 162Status : The 201 8-2019 school year had 80 incident reports and 6 suspensions. The 201 9-2020 school year is ending with 96 incident reports and 2 suspensions. Of the 96 incident reports, 11 students were sanctioned to complete one of the two educational programs concerning alcohol or substance abuse violations . Four of the eleven students have not yet completed the course and are in danger of being suspended for a violation of their probation terms, although three of the four only need to complete the short Part II of the course. The College expects to see a cont inued reduction of violations and suspensions in the 20 20-2021 school year . Goal 5 : To ensure the College is able to attract and retain a diverse, well -qualified, and competent workforce. (Strategic Plan Goal 4) Strategy 1: Investigate offerings for interpersonal communication skills . Responsibility : Director of Equity & Compliance, Director of Human Resources, Dean of Continuing Education and Workforce Development Timeline : Summer 2019 -Fall2019: Investigate offerings and plan/schedule for calendar ye ar 2020 Desired Outcome : 80% completion by designated employees of established course/program by June 2020. Measures : Number of employees who complete trainings; employee feedback; satisfaction surveys Status : The Student Experience Committee noted poor customer/student service as one of nine pain points for students . It was noted in the committee's report that poor communication and lack of communication by the college to the students leads to confusion, frustration, and inaction. Continuing with a focus on an effort to work toward better student service and relations, the College has utilized its Employee Assistance Program training offerings. Topics varied but many covered the importance of communication, such as \"Building a Culture of Respect\", 'Commun icating Effectively in a Diverse World\", and \"Customer Service Excellence\". Further trainings are planned. Strategy 2 : Conduct a compensation and salary equity study. Responsibility : President, Director of Human Resources Timeline : Study begins Fall 2018 in collaboration with Paypoint. Study/review is completed by May 2019. Budgeting should be drafted in accordance with the budget requirements and included for Board approval in June 2019. Plan implementation at beginning of FY20. Desired Outcome : Compensa tion study is completed and implemented to bring Garrett to market standards. Measures : Focus groups, job descriptions, employee satisfaction Status : One of the best ways to attract and retain a qualified, diverse workforce is by offering competitive wage s/salary. As of June 2019, Paypoint, the firm hired to complete the study, has completed a job classification phase to review grading for current positions and updated job descriptions, as well as a compensation study to match jobs to internal and external markets. The President has proposed to the Board of Trustees adoption of a four -year rollout of the compensation plan, which will increase compensation $549,886. The College implemented the first year of the plan in FY20 and has proposed to fund year 2 in FY21 with Board approval. 163III. RECRUITMENT OF NUMERICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS, FACULTY, AND STAFF : Garrett College believes in the importance of making its educational and employment opportunities accessible to minorities. Since Garrett County's popu lation is about 9 8% white, the College has had to look to other geographic areas in order to recruit minority students, faculty, and staff , and it has been very successful with respect to attracting and enrolling minority students. In fall 2019, non-white student enrollment was 23%, which far exceeds the minority representation of Garrett County, which is less than 3 %. The College will seek to maintain a minority population of at least 20% of its total student body . The College continues to focus its efforts on improving minority students' retention and completion rates, which tend to lag behind those of the College's overall student population, especially for Black/African American students . As indicated in the table belo w, the average number of African American completers remains consistent with the average number of minority completers throughout the year. The g oals and strategies indicated in the sections above with regard to the Thread student and international student recruitment efforts will help addr ess minority student enrollment, while the other goals and strategies with aid in retention and completion rates. Minority Student Retention Rates and Number of Completers (IPEDS Data) * Fall to Fall Fall-Fall Retention Rate 1st time cohort % increase over FY 13 Fiscal Year Minority Completers Fiscal Year African American Completers 2012 -13 31.2% Baseline 10 7 2013 -14 39.8% 8.6% 13 9 2014 -15 50% 18.8% 10 8 2015 -16 48.4% 17.2% 28 18 34.6% 3.4% -2020 41.8%** 10.6% 8 6 *Retention will not capture Allied Health ACM transfer students, so this does not necessarily mean the students are not retained or successful. It just means it is hard to track those students as retained at GC because that is not the purpose of the Allied Health Transfer program. **Fall 2020 students are still registering - number likely to change. Garrett College has been much less successful with respect to attracting and hiring minority faculty and professional staff. While the percentages of minorities among Garrett College's full -time faculty and professional staff exceed the representation of minorities within its service area, the actual number of individuals represented by those percentages is very small, due to the College's small size . For this reason, a personnel change involving a single individual can significantly alter the College's minority com position . Of additional c oncern is the fact that while 18 % of the College's student popula tion is Black/African American (fall 201 9 data), at present, the College has no Black (African Americ an) faculty members and only one Black/African American professi onal staff member . Moreover, due to its location and the demographics of its service area , Garrett College faces some significant challenges in trying to recruit and retain minority faculty and staff. Nevertheless, by using targeted recruitment strategies, the College hopes to be more successful in attracting minority faculty and professional st aff. The Director of Human Resources posts job openings on Diversity.com as one strategy to address this concern. Some of 164the impediments to minority recruitment and retention are : (Please note that these are not limited to the minority experience .) Finan cial - limited recruitment budget, inability to offer competitive faculty and professional staff salaries, lack of monies ear -marked for diversity initiatives. Typically s mall applicant pool of qualified minority candidates combined with intense competi tion for those candidates. Location - relatively isolated, small, rural college town. Demographics - small, rural minority population. Surrounding area is predominately white. Lack of employment opportunities for spouse or partner. Lack of for mal mentoring and retention efforts. Despite the se challenges, Garrett College remains committed to increasing the minority representation among its full -time faculty and professional staff and continues to have this a priority goal. IV. INITIATIVES TO INCREASE CULTURAL AWAREN ESS AMONG STUDENTS, FACULTY, STAFF , and COMMUNITY : Garrett College is fully committed to fostering an environment that not only embraces and celebrates cultural diversity, but also one that ensures that all students are made to feel welcome and supported in their journey towards academic success . However, certain cultural and ethnic differences may not always be recognized or fully understood, nor do faculty and staff always know ho w to respond appropriately to such differences . In addition, the College recognizes that it must provide faculty and staff with the information and ongoing training, as well as other learning opportunities such as open forums with diverse student populati ons, necessary to ensure they are adequately equipped to assist all students in achieving success. As evidenced in the section above, increasing cultural awareness with the campus community and beyond has become a primary initiative in the College's effort s. The College has one accomplishment to highlight from the 201 9-2020 school year . In January of 2018, two staff members and one faculty member attended the LGBTQ Academy SafeZone Train -the-Trainer Program offered by OutAlliance. One of the staff members has since left, however, the two remaining employees worked diligently to prepare a SafeZone training program for the College. In March of 2020, the college was able to hold its first in -person SafeZone training. Four students and twelve staff members were in attendance and the training was well received. The training was interactive and very informative for the participants. Individuals , including a faculty member and two students, shared their experiences both on and off -campus to help shed light on issue s and concerns related to the campus climate, discrimination, and lack of understanding . Participants were asked to complete an evaluation after attending the course and rated it highly with regard to the knowledge of the presenters, usefulness of the c ontent, and the ability to create a comfortable space where participants felt safe to speak and share. Many of the participants noted that they knew very little with regard to the LGBTQ community and felt that they had a better understanding after the trai ning and could help create a safe and inclusive community at Garrett. The evaluations and discussion have helped to bring to light the areas where the college needs to improve to help support our students. Real -life testimonials brought to the forefront is sues where not only students, but also employees, felt there needs to be improvement. There are future plans to hold more trainings, as well as discussion about what the college could do to be more inclusive and the trainers are working with the Director of Equity and Compliance to help implement some of the suggestions to do so. 165V. PROCCESS FOR REPORTING CAMPUS -BASED HATE CRIMES : Garrett College values its sense of community and expects students and employees to abide by specific regulations that dictate appropriate behavior. Any evidence of prejudice based on religion, sexual orientation, ge nder, disability, or ethnicity/ national origin can be viewed as a hate crime. The process for reporting crime statistics on a college campus is defined under Title 10, Subtitle 3 of the Criminal Law Article and is consistent with federal requirements under 20 U.S.C. 1092(f), known as th e Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics. The Campus Crime Statistics Act mandates the manner in which statistics are to be collected and the format in which they are to be published. In September of 2018, Garre tt College created the Office of Equity and Compliance and adopted an Equity Grievance Policy . The Office of Equity and Compliance oversees the College's compliance with Title IX, Title VI, Title VII, Clery Act, and other federal and state laws, regulation s and requirements. The Office of Equity and Compliance serves as a method of recourse to those, be they student, faculty, or staff, who believe that a particular action on the part of a College member has violated accepted or stated institutional practice s and standards. Garrett College affirms its commitment to promote the goals of fairness and equity in all aspects of the educational enterprise. All policies regarding Equal Opportunity, Harassment and Nondiscrimination are subject to resolution using the College's Equity Grievance Process (EGP). When the responding party is a member of the College community, the EGP is applicable regardless of the status of the reporting party who may be a member or non -member of the campus community, including students, student organizations, faculty, administrators, staff, guests, visitors, campers, etc. Any individual who feels they have been a victim of a hate crime or violation of the College 's Equal Opportunity, Harassment, and Nondiscrimination policy can file a re port with the Office of Equity and Compliance or anonymously by using the Reasonable Concern reporting form online. 166Defining Cultural Diversity at HCC: Diversity can be defined in a wide variety of ways. For the purpose of this document, \"diversity\" is defined as the recognition , appreciation and understanding of individual, group, and cultural similarities and differences that include, but are not limited to age, abilities and disabilities, ethnicity, language, gender, race, nationality, religion, socio -economic status, veteran status, and sexual orientation. Issues of diversity permeate many aspects of a campus environment and each is connected with the others. Unless incorporated into core structures of the College through strategic planning efforts, little will change substantively. HCC's strategic goals and action plans help guide achievement and changes in policies and procedures, with the overarching values of equal access and treatment as the foundations. Simply recruiting a more diverse student body without attending to other aspects of campus life, such as intergroup relations, curricular change, faculty and staff profes sional development, and diversifying faculty and staff, can result in difficulties for traditionally under-represented students. Comprehensive institutional change and integrated efforts are critical to provide positive educational outcomes within a climate of acceptance and respect for cultural diversity and equal opportunities for education, training and employment. The College's Mission, Values and Policy Cultural diversity, equality in education and equal employment opportunities are viewed as integr al parts of the mission and purpose of HCC. The mission, values and policy statements encourage and support diversity in the personal, professional and scholastic development and enrichment of all in the College community. Mission Hagerstown Community College ensures equitable access to affordable high quality educational programs, promotes practices and policies that ensure student success, and fosters innovation and collaboration to strengthen its regional workforce and community cultural development. Values The College believes in and teaches the ideals and values of cultural and racial diversity and a democratic way of life. HCC also seeks to cultivate in its students critical and independent thought, openness to new ideas, a sense of self- directio n, moral sensitivity, strength through diversity, and the value of continuing education and life-long learning. Diversity Policy Beyond its Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, HCC's Board of Trustees approved in 2010 the Anti- Discrimination Policy. Committed to a policy of cultural diversity and openness in preventing any form of discrimination, the College proactively through this policy is committed to preventing harassment and providing a genuine learning environment that is receptive to all views and backgrounds. Also addressed in the Code of Student Conduct, the College does not tolerate any language, action or behavior that is hostile to others. All students have the right to be free from unlawful intimidation or coercion, negative stereotyping and r acial, gender or cultural slurs. 167Accomplishments in FY21 related to Cultural Diversity: In August, HCC collaborated with the Washington County Chamber of Commerce to host a Facebook Live Community Conversation on Racism and Racial Equity . Panelists included community leaders and HCC representatives. In October, the College participated in the Maryland Male Students of Color Summit, hosted by the Maryland Association of Community College; both students and employee s participated in the day long virtu al program. In January, HCC hosted the annual Celebration of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. This year's event, Campus Reflections on Dr. King's Dream - More Than 50 Years Later included video reflections from employees and students and a panel discussion led by two faculty members and a Hagerstown City Council member. In February, HCC hosted an online Black History Month P oetry Contest. Students were given three prompts: w rite an Ode to a historical African American figure, write a response to Amanda Gorman's \"The Hill We Climb,\" or write a response to Mecca Verdell's \"Duck You Autocorrect.\" Slam poet Mecca Verdell spoke and performed at the awards ceremony and students winning first, second and third places read their poetry and talked about their inspiration. Students and employees enjoy ed it from their homes. In March, HCC h osted an Irish Music Concert with performer Mark Rust. The concert featured traditional Irish music, history of Irish traditions, and Irish American trivia. This event took place online where student and employees enjoyed it from their homes. We also recognize Women's History Month annually. This year, we highlighted four HCC alumnae who are leaders in the community and created videos about the struggles they've overcome, who inspires them, and how they would like to be remembered. Students were encouraged to watch and respond to the videos about what they found most impactful. This event was co -sponsored by the HCC Alumni Association. Additionally, an International Women's Day program was held in which stories of women who inspire were collected and shared on a college webpage. The College finalized a Name Change Process that allows students to request a chosen name and preferred pronouns on non- financial and unofficial documents. This change has also been incorporated on the admissions applications, whereby applicants can request a chosen name and indicate preferred pronouns from the start of their educational experience. HCC is in the process of trans itioning the long- standing Multicultural Committee to a Diversit y & Inclusion Committee, charged with providing guidance on the College's Strategic Plan . This committee will be co -chaired by the Dean of Students, Dean of Planning & Institutional Effectiveness , and the Executive Director of Human Resources. The D &I committee will have a budget to expand diversity and inclusion trainings and awareness programs for the camp us community. Employees will be invited to submit proposals for initiative s; if approved, c ampus initiatives will receive HCC endorsement, potential budgeting support, and assessment support through Planning and Institutional Effectiveness. A process is al ready in place for student groups to submit such proposals through the Student Government Association or the Student Activities and Dean of Students offices. 168Ways HCC anticipates COVID -19 has or will impact cultural diversity: Declining enrollments for students of color due to childcare issues and economic impacts . For example, b lack student enrollments were shown to be down 12%, mirroring national community college trends . Moving to virtual events in some ways encouraged expanded participation.

For the purpose of this document, \"diversity\" is defined as the recognition, appreciation and understanding of individual, group, and cultural similarities and differences that include, but are not limited to age, abilities and disabilities , ethnicity, language, gender, race, nationality, religion, socio -economic status, veteran st atus, and sexual orientation. Issues of diversity permeate many aspects of a campus environment and each is connected with the others. Unless incorporat ed into core structures of the C ollege through strategic planning efforts, little will change substantively. HCC's strategic goals and action plans help guide achievement and changes in policies and procedures, with the overarching values of equal access and treatment as the foundations. Simply recruiting a more diverse student body without attending to other aspects of campus life, such as intergroup relations, curricular change, faculty and staff professional development, and diversifying faculty and staff, can result in difficulties for traditionally under-represented students. Comprehensive institutional change and integrated efforts are critical to provide positive educational outcomes within a climate of acceptance and respect for cultural diversity and equal opportunities for educat ion, training and employment. The College's Mission, Values and Policy Cultural diversity , equal ity in education and equal employment opportunit ies are viewed as integral parts of the mission and purpose of HCC. The mission, values and policy statements encourage and support diversity in the personal, professional and scholastic development and enrichment of all in the College community. Mission Hagerstown Community College ensures equi table access to affordable high quality educational programs, promotes practices and policies that ensure student success, and fosters innovation and collaboration to strengthen its regional workforce and community cultural development. Values The College believes in and teaches the id eals and values of cultural and racial diversity and a democratic way of life. HCC also seeks to cultivate in its students critical and independent thought, openness to new ideas, a sense of self-direction, moral sensitivity, strength through diversity, and the value of continuing education and life-long learning. Diversity Policy Beyond its Equal Employment Opportunity Policy, HCC's Board of Trustees approved in 2010 the Anti- Discrimination Policy . Committed to a policy of cultural diversity and openness in preventing any form of discrimination, the College proactively t hrough this policy is committed to prevent ing harassment and providing a genuine learning environment that is receptive to all views and backgrounds. Also addressed in the Code of Student Conduct, t he College does not tolerate any language, action or behavior that is hostile to others. All students have the right to be free from unlawful intimidation or coercion, negative stereotyping and racial, gender or cultural slurs. 171The College's Service Area Being a lead er in the community, HCC takes seriously it s commitment to recruit students and employees of diverse backgrounds . HCC's credit minority enrollment of 27.7 percent in FY20 exceeded that of the county's minority population (approximately 21.8 percent) . Though Washington County became more racially and ethnically diverse over the last decade, it is still predominantly white and non- Hispanic. Black or African American residents comprise the largest minority group, as seen in Table One. Hispanic residents comprise the fastest growing ethnic /racial group in Washington County. Table One Washington County , MD Population by Race and Hispanic Origin 2017-19 V2017 V2018 V2019 Population % of Total Population % of Total Population % of Total % Change V2017 to V2019 PROGRESS TO IMPROVE CULTURAL DIVERSITY HCC's strategic plans have always incorporated goals and action plans for a diver se student body and workforce. HCC annually updates through its unit planning process the strategic plan, revising and adding objectives and action plans as institutional p riorities change or are added. The College, through its 2022 Strategic Plan, addresses the importance of diversity and multiculturalism by establishing specific goals (2, 3, 4, and 6), objectives and action plans. In doing so, HCC continues to improve its planning/evaluation model and bring about positive change related to improving cultural diversity among students, faculty and staff. Bulleted below each relevant goal of the 2022 Strategic Plan are updates regarding progress with impact on cultural diversity made since FY19. Institutional policy statements provide the overarching foundation for these plans. The Board of Trustees established policies to address issues of diversity, integrity and respect across campus. These policies include: Anti-Discrimination (Policy #4042); Academic Integrity (Policy #4045); Discrimination and Harassment (Policy #5032); Expressive Activity (Policy #8068); Sexual Harassment (Policy #8070A) and the Equal Employment Opportunity (Policy #5003).

Two of the College's programs use a case management approach to help remove barriers and provide support for learning. Both the Job Training Student Resources (college funded) and TRiO Student Support Services (grant funded) programs work closely with at-risk students to help them persist, complete their courses and graduate. Both programs serve high- risk populations, of which over 30 percent fall into a minority group. The Director of Financial Aid hosts workshops for low income, at-risk students selected by high school counselors. This outreach effort is designed to encourage participation in higher education by covering federal and state financial aid programs, concerns about borrowing and important de adlines. The results of these efforts are demonstrated by an increase in minority students receiving financial aid as seen in Table Three . In FY 20, 67.9 percent of enrolled minorities received financial aid. 178Table Three Students Receiving Financial Aid by Race, Ethnic ity and Minority Status: FY 201 5 - FY 20 19 Headcount% Receiving Financial AidHeadcount% Receiving Financial AidHeadcount% Receiving Financial AidHeadcount% Receiving Financial AidHeadcount% Receiving Financial Aid Total Students Receiving 15 53.3% 14 71.4% 13 76.9% 15 48.7% 119 52.1% Islander 11 27.3% 9 55.6% 6 66.7% 251 72.1% 253 68.4% 290 69.3% unknown 130 58.5% 120 57.5% 106 63.2% 113 71.7% 125 Category (excludes loans and work-study self-help aid ^Minority count excludes categories of white (non-Hispanic), international, and students whose race and/or ethnicity is unknown.Office of Planning and Institutional Effectiveness, 6/5/2020FY 2018 2016 FY 2019 FY 2015 179The HCC Work Force The strategic value of diversity among the students, faculty, and local community, is recognized as the College strives to be a leader and catalyst for diverse social, ethnic, and educational experiences. HCC utilizes the HigherEdJobs diversity and inclusi on email package which helps to recruit for diverse applicants and demonstrates HCC's commitment to diversity and inclusion. T he HR Recruitment Specialist attend s local and career fairs in the Hagerstown, Frederick, and Baltimore areas, and also at the Martinsburg VA Medical Center. Positions are posted to the career centers of universities such as Bowie State University, Morgan State University, University of Maryland, Notre Dame of Maryland University and American University. Additionally, positions are posted to the Maryland Workforce Exchange, Pennsylvania Job Gateway and Workforce West Virginia. Job flyers are sent to regional local veteran's employment representatives for distribution as well. The College is benefiting from the aforementioned recruitment efforts to increase diversity in hiring faculty to provide role models for the increasingly diverse studen t population. According to the f all 201 9 EDS report, 9.2 percent of all full -time employees identified themselves as a minority. Of full -time faculty, there were six minorities (7.7 percent), which is an improvement from previous years. Of all non-faculty full- time employees in f all 201 9, 20, or 9.8 percent , were minorities, a percentage that has remained relatively flat over the previous year. Facing t he challenge to recruit full- time faculty and administrators of color to provide positive role models an d to help create a culturally diverse environment is an institutional priority. The region lacks cultural and ethnic opportunities, as well as a significant professional minority population found in the urban and metropolitan areas. Along with employee recruitment, the HR Office is responsible for new hire orientation and employee training and professional development; and legal compliance with all federal, state and local regulations. One aspect of training for all employees focuses on prevention of discrimination and hara ssment via completion of an electronic module for annual recertification . 180 Table Four Full-time Faculty & Staff by Race, Ethnicity and Minority Status: Fall 2015 - Fall 2019 PROCESS FOR REPORTING CAMPUS -BASED HATE CRIMES The safety and security of the College community are of vital concern to Hagerstown Community College.

Diversity at Harford Community College At the institutional level, HCC has championed diversity, which has been included in the College's Mission Statement and its Strategic Plans . Equity and inclusion are part of HCC's current list of values , which states: \"Our shared purpose unites us, and our diversity strengthens our actions. We intentionally engage many voices and seek to understand existing inequities before taking action. We bring open minds and appreciation of backgrounds, expertise, talents, and experiences to every conversation.\" ( https://www.harford.edu/about- harford/get -to-know- harford/ ). Diversity is woven into the everyday work of the college. For example, m any courses at HCC incorporate diversity as a learni ng objective, and most programs require one diversity -designated class for graduation . Diversity is included as a factor in employee performance reviews . The campus regularly offers training in equitable and inclusive work practices, as well as in diversity and cultural awareness. HCC has had a Diversity, Inclusion, Culture, and Equity (DICE) Committee (originally known as the Cultural Diversity Committee) since 201 2. In 2021, DICE was incorporated under the President's Office to give its work higher visibility and embed its work more deeply in all aspects of campus life and operations . DICE has also officially become a part of the new Collegial Governance structure at HCC as one of the All-College Committees charged with addressing issues of importance to the entire college. Recently, the DICE Committee revised its Equity and Inclusion Statement : \"As the anchor institution for higher education in Harford County, Harf ord Community College embraces equity and inclusion as guiding principles for best serving ALL of our students and ALL Harford County residents. Collectively, we benefit from the collaborative learning environment that is fostered when everyone's unique voices and life experiences are welcomed, shared, and valued. Our policies, practices, and pedagogies are designed to create a pluralistic environment that is free from intolerance, that honors our College's values, and that includes all voices and viewpoints. We believe that such a diverse, inclusive environment contributes to student success by providing equitable access to education and learning opportunities. Through education and awareness, we empower members of our community to contribute to the advancement of social justice in our global society.\" The DICE Committee also crafted a new Plan for Cul tural Diversity, which was approved by the College's leadership and the Board of Trustees in 2020. The new plan outlines three major goals for improving diversity: 1: Increase campus dialogue on and engagement in critical cultural diversity issues, with an emphasis on equity and inclusion; 2: Employ a variety of assessment methods to understand the campus cultural diversity climate ; 3: Increase opportunities for students and staff to learn about domestic and global issues that impact diversity, equity, and inclusion. Ongoing a nd New Institutional Initiatives Related to Diversity 1.The Center for E xcellence in Teaching and L earning (CETL) , which opened officially in January 2018, offers many programs and training opportunities that focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion to improve teaching and learning . CETL is at the intersection of all activities and planning connected with faculty professional development, including the creation of direct professional development ( PD) training and offerings , the coordination of PD opportunities across campus, and the development of resource materials for faculty development. For example, during the pandemic, CETL sponsored a Teaching Online Academy (TOA) and TOA 183- Next Level , two eLearning training in Blackboard to help faculty move to online teaching. Each course has specific sections on accessibility design for online courses and in Blackboard. Combined, over 350 faculty took the courses. CETL is also developing programs that guide faculty in culturally responsive teaching. 2.The DICE Committee Book Club launched in the spring of 2021, with four discussion sessions that focused on the anti-racist book, So You Want to Talk About Race, by Ijeoma Oluo. DICE and the O ffice of the President purchased 50 copies for the campus communi ty, and the sessions were well attended with over 40 participants . Additionally, both the Financial Aid Office and Learning Center have recently elected to read the book So You Want to Talk About Race as a department to continue this conversation with employees. DICE selected Waking Up White by Debby Irving for the 2021-2022 academic year. 3.HCC's 30-Day Social Justice Challenge: The staff, faculty , and students at Harford Community College spent 30 days starting April 5, 2021, committed to learning about racial injustice in America in an effort to enact change. Each day during the challenge was devoted to reading, listening, watching, or acting - moving together toward mutual understanding, equality, and justice. Participants were encouraged to, \" challenge yourself to look deeply at how you respond - your beliefs and feelings. Keep a journal of your thoughts and insights. What have you learned? How were you affected? We encourage you to check in with each other throughout the challenge AND discuss your experiences with what you have read, seen, or done.\" A virtual discussion was also held later in the month for participants to discuss what they had learned . This activity was further expanded to ask all departments in Student Affairs to provide a summary of their goals to respond to the 30- Day Social Justice Challenge which will be implemented during the 2021-2022 academic year. 4. Lifting As We Climb: A Celebration of African American Women: The humanities division hosted a virtual presentation , \"Lifting As We Climb: A Celebration of African American Women,\" on March 30, 2021, as part of Women's History Month. The historical significance of the \"Lifting As We Climb\" motto was discussed and local and national African American female trailblazers were featured. Dr. Theresa Felder, Harford Community College President, and Dr. Jac queline Jackson, Vice President for Student Success, joined this event and shar ed their reflections about the significant mentors and role models in their lives. 5.Country of Focus Event: Honduras: The DICE Committee held a celebration of Honduras in a virtual event in April of 2021. The event brought together political science, sociology, and music faculty to discuss the culture and history of Honduras, which was the country selected for focus in this academic year. The country was also highlighted in a variety of ways in the courses of faculty across the curriculum ; the Library created a LibGuide of resources for faculty and student use. DICE selected Cameroon as the country of focus for the 2021-2022 academic year. The COVID- 19 Effect on HCC's Diversity Efforts HCC has worked hard, since the fall of 2020, to determine how the COVID -19 outbreak and eventual pandemic would impact the campus, our community, our students, and employees. The College made a successful shift to online modalities, and it created programs to support both students and faculty during this unprecedented change. At all stages, ensuring that students had equitable access to resources and educational opportunities was a priority . Below are some of the ways that this was accomplished: 1. My College Success Network (MCSN) is a compilation of services, events, staff, and faculty geared toward empowering and supporting our students of color. The Network was implemented in July 2014 to address the equity gap that exists between African American and white students. In FY2020, the My College Success Network expanded the focus from primarily African American students to all students of color. While the program is open to all students, newly enrolled students of color are invited to participate. All newly enrolled students of color are assigned to a Student Success Advisor . All students in the Network are also connected to cultural programming coordinated through the Soar2Success Program to promote the recruitment and retention of students of color at our institution. In response to the pandemic, MCSN successfully transitioned to a virtual environment and moved both SDEV 110, \" Success in College and Beyond,\" and SDEV 111, \"Personalized Career Exploration ,\" online. Academic coaches participated in the Teaching Online Academy (TOA) Next Level and successfully move d courses into Blackboard and held both individual and group 184coachin g sessions via Teams . MCSN recruited students through individual and group MCSN information sessions via Teams, the Annual Kickback Mixer, and faculty/staff referrals. Program services were expanded to Network students through a collaborative retention initiative called , \"MCSN: Strength Through Support.\" This ongoing initiative feature s a variety of engaging student support sessions designed to promote inclusion, connection, and support in a virtual environment . Example presentation topics include , \"The First Gen Speaker Series: How Did I Get Here,\" which features HCC faculty/staff who share their First Gen story along with their key message to students , and the \"Student Series \" which highlight s MCSN student -led presentations on a variety of topics . Additionally, MCSN expanded its services to support student- athletes that experienced academic challenges through another ongoing retention initiative entitled, \"Academic Training Camp ,\" which provides student success programming over the course of a week ; it was offered before the start of the Spring 2021 semester. During the Spring 2021 semester, student- athletes were also offered informal academic coaching through the Learning Center. MCSN worked to reinitiate the mentoring program in Spring 2021, a s the previous mentoring program consisted of Federal Work -Study peer assistants who were no longer able to work in this role unsupervised since HCC transitioned to a virtual environment in March of 2020. Seventy -three students received coaching during the fall 2020 semester and 53 students who received coaching during the spring 2021 semester for a total of 126 students . The total unduplicated number of students who received coaching for the 2020-2021 academic year was 96. A total of 1,580 unduplicated students were enrolled in the overall Network for the 2020- 2021 academic year. R etention and persistence rates for MCSN students also show promise in that the retention and persistence rates for the academic coaching cohort exceed that of the comparison group for almost all semesters (see Appendix A for additional details). 2. The HCC Library continued to be an important campus resource to help create equity for our students. The Library made computer equipment available to loan on a first -come, first -served basis. Laptops and devices were made available for pick -up and hot spots were provided for students who did not have internet access. While the staff offered consulting and research services via a variety of online methods (chat, text, and email) since the start of the pandemic, t he Library also eventually re -opened on a limited basis for students. Library use is currently available in two -hour increments and is by reservation only for use of reserve materials, textbooks, or technology, and upon completing the mandatory health screening questionnaire and on- campus screenings. Books were available for loan and pick- up service via an online form . The Library cont inued to offer one -on-one virtual research consultation, as well as embedding librarians in online classes for easier and more direct access to students. 3. The Student Emergency Assistance (SEA) Fund provides emergency financial assistance to currently -enrolled Harford Community College students who are facing a short -term financial emergency. The goal is to help current students remain in school. Awards are based on fund availability with the maximum award equaling $500 per student per academic year. Every attempt was made to process the application within 48 hours. Awards are considered financial aid and must be processed through the Financial Aid Office. 4. The College has an existing refund exception process for students who have extenuating circumstances that have required them to withdraw from some or all of their courses after working with their instructor(s) and exhausting all other options. Refunds are offered in the form of future credit. Knowing that the COVID -19 pandemic may cause extreme hardships for students to complete their courses, the refund exception committee will continue to review student requests for refunds. 5. The College continued to hold cultural programming events, but in a virtual environment, during the 2020-2021 academic year. These included a variety of programs related to cultural diversity, including a series on anti - racism, a Black Heritage Month series, a celebration of Honduras and its culture, and the DICE anti -racist book club discussions. 6. There h ave been no reported incidents of hate crimes at HCC for the 2020- 2021 academic year. Appendi ces: A. My College Success Network (MCSN) Student Academic Achievement and Retention Rates 185B.

The college extended its incomplete deadline until the end of the Fall 2020 semester to allow students extra time to successfully complete their coursework. The GPAs for the Spring 2020 semester were reassessed and updated after the Fall 2020 semester and have been provided above. In addition, retention and persistence rates for MCSN students also show promise in that the retention and persistence rates for the academic coaching cohort exceed that of the comparison group for almost all semeste rs: My College Success Network Retention Rates Cohort Timeframe Retention Rate Fall-to-Spring Persistence or Transfer MCSN academic coaching students Fall 2018 -Spring 2019 94.94% Comparison group of students Fall 2018 -Spring 2019 86.49% All new HCC students Fall 2018 -Spring 2019 83.88% MCSN academic coaching students Spring 2019 - Fall 2019 83.67% Comparison group of students Spring 2019 - Fall 2019 63.05% All new HCC students Spring 2019 - Fall 2019 64.14% MCSN academic coaching students Fall 2019 - Spring 2020 81.48% Comparison group of students Fall 2019 - Spring 2020 72.60% All new HCC students Fall 2019 - Spring 2020 78.07% MCSN academic coaching students Spring 2020 - Fall 2020 *57.41 % Comparison group of students Spring 2020 - Fall 2020 *70.37% All new HCC students Spring 2020 - Fall 2020 *57.50% MCSN academic coaching students Fall 2020 - Spring 2021 86.96% Comparison group of students Fall 2020 - Spring 2021 75.36% All new HCC students Fall 2020 -Spring 2021 75.05 % Fall-to-Fall Retention or Transfer MCSN academic coaching students Fall 2018 -Fall 2 019 75.95% Comparison group of students Fall 2018 -Fall 2019 59.46% All new HCC students Fall 2018 -Fall 2019 72.73% 186MCSN academic coaching students Fall 2019 - Fall 2020 44.40% Comparison group of students Fall 2019 - Fall 2020 26.03% All new HCC students Fall 2019 - Fall 2020 63.90% *Please note that the persistence statistics for Spring 2020 to Fall 2020 have been updated from the last report to include a new randomized comparison cohort. This was done to remove the error that resulted from a large amount of withdraws from the initia l comparison cohort . The higher retention number in the comparison cohort for Spring 2020 to Fall 2020 can be attributed to a higher number of students who transferred that semester in that randomized cohort. **Original comparison population is the same size as the SDEV population. A comparison population was randomly generated based on the conditions given (student type, cumulative credits earned: +/- 15, race, and transitional need: +/-2) and registration at t he 20% date. Some of these students withdrew from all classes after this date and are counted as withdrawn. APPENDIX B: Harford Community College Plan for a Program of Cultural Diversity 2020-2023 Harford Community College (HCC) is a two- year college that believes in providing an open and inclusive environment to all students and employees. Harford Community College expects to sustain an atmosphere where individuals and groups can maintain a sense of cultural identity while supporting a strong, integrated campus community. For purposes of this plan, \"cultural diversity\" means the inclusion of those racial and ethnic groups and individuals that are or have been underrepresented in higher education. (Article 11-406) Background: Diversity has been an HCC value at the institutional level as included in the College's mission s tatement and strategic plan; it is included as a factor in employee performance reviews. Many courses at HCC incorporate diversity as a learning objective, and students must take one di versity -designated class in most programs to graduate with an Associate's degree. In an attempt to attract and retain diverse candidates, a Talent Management Committee was formed; the committee updated the HCC application portal and made progress towards advertising positions in more diverse academic journals, sites, and conferences. To further advance the College's commitment to cultural diversity, in October 2012, the Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Vice President for Student Affairs and Institutional Effectiveness established a Cultural Diversity Committee , with the foll owing purposes: 1. Review and update the College's Plan for a Program of Cultural Diversity, as required by MHEC; 2. Assess the College's progress toward achieving the goals and implementing the plan; 3. Complete required annual reporting by stated due dates for Board of Trustees approval (MHEC progress report); 4. Identify those programs/services/activities that can have the greatest possible impacts on campus cultural diversity and recommend how our resources might best be utilized and coordinated to fulfill the campus cultural diversity plan; 5. Identify barriers to achieving greater success in fulfilling the cultural diversity plan and provide recommendations on how the College can overcome those barriers; 1876. Ass ist in the preparation of funding requests to support cultural diversity activities; 7. Work with governance committees/councils, departments, and offices on promulgating positive cultural diversity practices; 8. Serve as a clearinghouse and communications center for activities relating to cultural diversity on- and off- campus. In 2019, The Committee for Cultural Diversity voted to change its name to the Diversity, Inclusion, Culture, and Equity (DICE) committee. This change in the name reflects the broader, expanded mission of the committee to consider issues of diversity and their intersection with issues of equity and inclusion. It also widened the scope of the committee's work to embrace the way that diverse viewpoints must be included and welcomed in mainstream campus life to be effectively heard and considered. The DICE committee includes members from across the HCC campus, including from all academic divisions, as well as from departments that interface with students, such as Human Resources, Advising, Career and Transfer Services, and Disability Support and Inte rvention Services. The DICE committee has worked to create a new Plan for a Program of Cultural Diversity, for the academic years 2020-2023. Alignments with HCC Strategic Plan and MHEC Plan: The Plan for a Program of Cultural Diversity aligns with HCC's new FY20 - FY24 Strategic Plan . Specifically, the Plan's goals, which center on diversity and equity, support the following strategies and their objectives: Strategy 2: Create an engaging and inclusive learning experience so ALL students can achieve their goals . Objectives: 1. Identify and implement structures and resources to foster an inclusive and equitable learning experience for all students. 2. Customize onboarding and guided pathways for students to facilitate goal attainment. 3.

Develop talent (or employee) acquisition practices that work to proactively attract high-quality candidates, repres entative of a wide variety of backgrounds and cultures. 4. Develop processes and procedures that create efficiencies in daily activities to make effective use of college resources, position employees to be successful, and positively impact the student experie nce. 1885. Cre ate an Administrative Procedures Manual to clarify structures and methods for performing various campus operations and activities. Strategy 5: Prepare students to distinguish themselves as compassionate contributors and leaders in the global commu nity. Objectives : 1. Design multidisciplinary content and develop multiple delivery mechanisms to integrate global learning across the curriculum to prepare students for life, work, and citizenship. 2. Create opportunities for students, staff, and faculty to hone leadership skills and utilize them in community service at the local, state, national, and global levels to promote active lifelong learning through engagement. 3. Institutionalize comprehensive globalization at HCC to ensure that our initiatives are dynamic, leading - edge, and enduring. 4. Build and maintain connections that provide a vital community resource so that global understanding and stewardship thrive in Harford County. The Maryland Higher Education Commission's 2017-2021 State Plan for Postsecondary Education: Student Success with Less Debt outlines three primary goals for the postsecondary community in the state. One of those goals is to \"ensure equitable access to affordable and quality postsecondary education for all Maryland residents.\" The new Plan for a Program of Cultural Diversity also aligns with the new MHEC goal of Access. The Plan for a Program of Cultural Diversity, 2020-2023 Goals: In keeping with the Strategic Plan, previous Plans for Cultural Diversity, and current demographics, the DICE Committee proposes the following three goals and supporting strategies. GOAL 1: Increase campus dialogue on and engagement in critical cultural diversity issues, with an emphasis on equity and inclusion. Strategies Target Groups In coordination, whenever possible, with the Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL), offer regular professional development for faculty and staff, including DICE training, Safe Zone training, cultural awareness and diversity, equity and inclusion for new employees, and instructional methods with an emphasis on cultural responsiveness and equity. Faculty and staff 189Strategies Target Groups Increase opportunities for dialogue on critical cultural diversity issues through a variety of programming, including an annual spring semester Country of Focus event that highlights a selected speaker . Continue to offer rich co-curricular opportunities that enrich the cultural diversity of our campus. Faculty, staff, and students Organize and host an annual Equity and Inclusion S ummit (ideally held every fall semester) to discuss best practices and strategies for implementing equity and inclusion in the classroom and through our service to students. Faculty, staff , and students (from within HCC, Harford County, and other community colleges) Sponsor a recognition award (one each for faculty , staff, and community members ), to be presented at the annual Equity and Inclusion S ummit (see above) . The purpose of the recognition would be to highlight HCC employees who have had a measurable impact on promoting the goals of equity and inclusion in their classrooms, programs, services, and interactions with students. Faculty and staff Work with Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning (CETL), Achieving the Dream, and other programs on campus to assess current barriers and collaborate to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion Faculty and staff GOAL 2: Employ a variety of assessment methods to understand the campus cultural diversity climate. Strategies Target Group Distribute a campus -wide survey by DICE every third year, to correspond with the lifecycle of the plan, to understand the campus climate for students , and also assess equity; compare to results of the previous survey when possible . Students Analyze results of other surveys conducted by HCC, including campus climate surveys and PACE surveys, to ascertain trends in diversity, equity, and inclusion. Facult y, staff, and students Maintain a process for capturing and responding to information on campus cultural diversity climate incidents . Facult y, staff, and students 190GOAL 3: I ncrease opportunities for students and staff to learn about domestic and global issues that impact diversity, equity, and inclusion. Strategies Target Group Maintaining the Country of Focus program throughout the academic year, culminating in a spring- semester, campus- wide academic presentation from a selected speaker . Facult y, staff, and students Design a DICE website to serve as the hub of information about diversity, equity, and inclusion. The website will include the campus's Equity and Inclusion statement , the President's message of support, related program information, and links to research on the Country of Focus and EI -related campus and pedagogical resources . Faculty, staff, students , and community members The work of the DICE Committee will be carried out by several subcommittees that will be responsible for implementing the strategies that support the three goals. A Note about Covid-19 Beginning in the spring of 2020, HCC, like many colleges nationwide, moved its courses and the bulk of its work to a virtual environment. Some of the committee's goals, such as the annual summit, may not be possible to implement immediately, until the campus and the nation can better assess the lasting impact of the coronavirus pandemic on our respective communities . APPENDIX A: Revised Equity and I nclusion Statement In 2020, the DICE Committee revised its Equity and Inclusion Statement to better reflect its goals. \"As the anchor institution for higher education in Harford County, Harford Community College embraces equity and inclusion as guiding principles for best serving all of our students and all Harford County residents. Collectively, we benefit from the collaborative learning environment that is fostered when everyone's unique voices and life experiences are welcomed, shared, and valued. \"Our policies, practices, and pedagogies are designed to create a pluralistic environment that is free from intolerance, that honors our College's values, and that includes all voices and viewpoints. We believe that such a diverse, inclusive environment contributes to student success by providing equitable access to education and learning opportunities. \"Through education and awareness, we empower members of our community to contribute to the advancement of social justice in our global society.\" 191APPEN DIX B: HCC 2020-2025 Strategic Plan and the Seven Achieving the Dream ( ATD ) Capacities Strategic Plan On Tuesday, June 11, the Board of Trustees of Harford Community College voted unanimously to approve a new strategic plan for fiscal years 2020 through 2025.

[1]34 CFR 668.46 (c)(3) 203Howard Community College - Cultural Diversity Report 2021 A.A description of how the institution defines diversity (no more than one page); how did the institution develop that definition (e.g., processes, sources, and guidance used)? Diversity is recognizing, appreciating, respecting, listening to and learning from the unique talents and contributions of all people. Howard Community College ( HCC) is committed to valuing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and recognizes the critical role of an educational institution in preparing its students, faculty, and staff to become contributing members of the global community. HCC seeks to respect persons of all ages, genders, sexual orientations, races, religions, ethnic backgrounds, abilities, and disabilities , as well as to promote the values of equal rights, equal access, and equal treatment through programs. To ensure success, all members of the college community are asked to accept their responsibility of supporting the college's priority to incorpor ate diversity , equity, and inclusion into the fabric of the institution. The presi dent in 1999 chartered the first Diversity Committee (now called Diversity, Equity , and Inclusion Committee ) consisting of representation from across all functional areas of the colleges. The president and the committee formulated the definition of diversity after examining sources from worldwide groups. This statement is contained within the committee 's bylaws , which are reviewed annually . During that review process alterat ions to the definition have been considered, recommended to the president and her team , and enacted. 204B. A brief (no more than one page) highlight of the most successful ongoing and new institutional initiatives designed to address issues related to cultural diversity within the campus and the broader community, and how their efficacy is measured . The co- chairs of the DEI Committee reported highlights of its accomplishments to the board of trustees at its April 2021 public meeting. The committee: R ecommended and approved the Diversity Committee name change to Diversity, Equity , and Inclusion t o better reflect its full mission . H osted 75 virtual events over the last year, including an all-online Diversity Week. The annual diversity week program included more co- curricular offerings by faculty and staff members. Enhanced advertisement methods were developed such as posters listing all events as well as individual events, listing links on the HCC website, listings on the HCC portal, a nnouncements through emails and weekly highlights from the president as well as from diversity committee members. Coordinated programming on campus with topics including campus climate, cultural competency, LGBTQIA concerns, immigration, implicit bias, international education, structural racism, and working with students with disabilities. Increased programmatic synergies with student support groups of Ambiciones, Career Links, Howard P.R.I.D.E., Silas Craft Collegians, and Student Support Services. Spons ored four colloquium series: Modern African Literature, Middle Eastern Literature, Asian Literature, and anti -racism. Acquired new diversity training materials with a focus on the topics of cultural competence, gender equity and identity, intersectionality, unconscious bias, microaggressions, privilege, and social justice. Increased training for the DEI committee members and college community was offered including featured training on: Building Trust in Diverse Work Environments; Experiencing and Managing Imposter Syndrome; Microaggressions in the Workplace and Classroom; and Search Committee Procedures. Participated in statewide diversity roundtable meetings that provide a strong platform for networking, as well as learning about other diversity programs. Established the hate and bias incident response team as a subcommittee of the college's diversity committee to coordinate educational responses to incidents of hate and bias on campus in conjunction with existing cross -functional teams that address behavioral interventions, student conduct, and employee well -being. All programming is evaluated by participants; that process also identifies opportunities for improvement that are reviewed by the DEI. There are diversity met rics in the board of trustees key performance indicator system and progress toward those targets is reviewed annually . 205C. A brief (no more than one page) discussion of the ways in which the institution anticipates COVID -19 most affecting - either negatively or positively - its efforts to enhance diversity on its campus or campuses. This may include, for example, acknowledgement of issues such as disproportionate impacts on retention and graduation among certain populations; the shift to distance education modalities limiting the ability to provide in -person programming; or, in contrast, the shift to online education providing opportunity for more students to access diversity programming. Howard Community College is committed to supporting students and employees and enhancing diversity on its campus no matter the circumstance. The 18 months of experience delivering programs and services virtually in response to the global pandemic has provided ample opportunity to refine and improve them. The enrollment management cross -functional team is meeting weekly to examine enrollment trends, analyze student needs gathered from calls, and determine action to support students during the registration process. The college completion team and its subcommittees examine information to identify and resolve retention and completion barriers. The DEI Committee operated successfully last year and will: implement the revised plan for diversity, equity, and inclusion and committee policies to effectively position the committee as campus thought leaders in promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. increase outreach to areas and individuals in the college to promote future diversity training and workshops. Increase online diversity training and programs to expand diversity training opportunities to a larger group of the college community. continue to seek additional meeting times, locations, and partnerships for diversity events to accommodate the growing needs of the college. Staff meetings are also a possible time to hold a divers ity activity, particularly for smaller offices where coverage may be an issue. continue supporting the office of student life and counseling and career services on \"Food for Thought,\" a monthly discussion series on diversity related topics for the campus community. continue the expansion of programming and outreach to increase students' exposure to historically black and minority serving institutions to include increased promotion of articulation agreements between Maryland's four historically black colle ges and universities, additional college tours, and on campus exposure. expand opportunities for faculty/staff discussions on diversity -related topics, including sponsoring faculty -led reading circles on topics of immigration, multicultural awareness, at -promise students, and privilege. implement key recommendations from interviews and surveys of minority employees by the office of human resources and the diversity committee. 206Report to the Board of Trustees Howard Community College Plan for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion April 21, 2021 Howard Community College (HCC) has had a plan for diversity, equity, and inclusion in place for over 30 years. The plan for diversity, equity, and inclusion sets forth guidelines for ensuring equity and improving cultural diversity in recruitment, employment, academics, retention of students, and the overall experience at the college. It mandates that HCC's diversity programs provide opportunities for the college community to engage in understanding, awareness, and respect of differences in age, gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, ethnic background, and abili ty/disability, as well as the values of equitable rights, access, and treatment. To oversee diversity activity, the plan calls for the college to continuously maintain a diversity committee with membership approved by the president. The committee is required to annually review and update the plan for diversity, equity, and inclusion, as appropriate. HCC is proud of its plan for diversity, equity, inclusion, and ongoing campus diversity programming. In 2018, the college's efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion were recognized by the Association of Community College Trustees with the Charles Kennedy Equity Award. In 2019, the college was awarded the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in the category of education, highlighting efforts by the college to triple its graduation rates for Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino first -time-to- college students within two years of entry. Cultural diversity continues to be addressed in a number of ways, including the following: A multitude of diversity, educational, and awareness events are offered to employees and students throughout each year, including films, musical performances, lectures, podcasts, talking circles, and discussions. A major promotion is highlighted by an annual \"Diversity Week\" each spring. Each budgeted staff member and full -time faculty member is required to participate in at least two diversity educational sessions per year. All employees are required to take periodic anti -harassment training that addresses all forms of harassment. New employees must take the training immediately, and existing employees re- take the training every two years. Recruitment efforts actively target minority candidates, and recruitment efforts and personnel actions are monitored to ensure equal opportunity and non- discrimination. Search committees are created to ensure that one member represents the Diversity Committee and its mission. 207 Academic options are offered to provide students with an interdisciplinary framework to address topics including, but not limited to: race, gender, ethnicity, social class, disabilities, wellness, and cultural proficiency. The college's Guided Pathways for students emphasize general education options that include ethics and global literacy. The admissions and advising office has close working relationships with schools, community organizations, and other institutions that enhance the college's ability to attract diverse populations. The college works with groups such as Conexiones, a community -based organization that helps Hispanic/Latinx students in Howard County achieve academically; high school clubs for Hispanic/Latinx students; the Black Student Achievement Program; Alpha Achievers, a support group for African American males in the Howard County Public School System; and FIRN, the Foreign- born Information and Referral Network, a Howard County non- profit that helps immigrants and refugees. The admissions and advising office works with the college's English Institute and noncredit English as a Second Language (ESL) programs to enhance student access to HCC. The admissions and advising office participates in fairs for diverse populations, conducts its own fairs, and forms partnerships with a broad range of colleges and universities to incorporate access to the next steps following HCC. Among these, admissions and advising will host a three- part series on Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic Serving Institutions. Examples of innovative academic programs include the Silas Craft Collegians Program, which provides a supportive learning community for students whose past academic performance in high school does not reflect their true academic potential, and Step UP, a program that pairs students with faculty/staff coaches who provide one-on-one support for managing the challenges of college. Many students in these programs are from under -represented groups, often first -generation college students. TRIO -Student Support Services (TRIO) is a formerly U.S. Department of Education grant -funded academic support program, currently interim funded by the college with the capacity to serve up to 242 first -generation, low -income, and students with documented disabilities. Student support services provides one- on-one support for managing the challenges of college and prepares students to graduate and transfer from HCC. The TRIO project was funded through August 2020, and the college has been funding the student support services program for fiscal year 2021. Career Links is an institutionally -funded progr am that currently serves 120 students who are displaced homemakers over age 35, single parents (male or female), or single pregnant women who are unemployed/under -employed and committed to earning a college degree or certificate leading to a career. The program provides 208counseling, a support group, advising, and financial literacy education for its participants. Project Access is a program designed to significantly facilitate the transition of high school students with disabilities into postsecondary education, to increase the success rate and retention of freshman students with disabilities at HCC, and to improve career counseling and job placement services for students with disabilities. The program served 80 students through its summer institute and em ploys 10 former students as peer mentors. The Global Distinction Program is an academic enrichment program open to students in all degree programs. To earn global distinction, students must meet the following criteria: take 15 credits of globally intense coursework (including world languages) and earn a \"C\" or higher; participate in a globally enriching event each semester; either study abroad or complete an internship that provides experiential global learning; and demonstrate their learning in a portfoli o. INSPIRES Global Perspectives is a year -long faculty and staff professional development program that allows employees to study, reflect on, and incorporate a global perspective into their core work. Howard P.R.I.D.E. is a leadership program that supports the academic, professional, and personal development of black and minority male students, with an emphasis on improving educational outcomes such as academic standing, graduation, and transfer. The 200 participants of Howard P.R.I.D.E. have the followi ng resources available: tutoring, mentoring, service learning, leadership seminars, individualized academic advising, academic monitoring, and personalized career and academic plans. The HCC Safe Zone, developed through collaboration between the college's wellness center and the counseling and career center, is a network of allies committed to providing a welcoming, supportive, and safe environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, intersex, and asexual and allies (LGBTQIA) students, staff, and faculty. Comprehensive training is provided to allies who provide visible support through the display of the Safe Zone logo and agree to be supportive of LGBTQIA students and employees. Safe Zone allies help support the SAGA (Sexuality and Gender Alliance) group on campus. HCC's Hispanic/Latinx student success completion program, Ambiciones, promotes Hispanic/Latinx student success by recruiting Hispanic/Latino students and implementing initiatives to focus on retention of these students. The project links Hispanic/Latinx students to the academic support services to foster student success, retention, and completion. Currently, the project serves 100 students, and is focusing on scaling up the program again for the 2021- 2022 academic year. 209 The Women of Color Initiative, facilitated by student life and counseling and career services, welcomes women of color to the HCC community through a series of programs that will be of interest to them and can help with their personal and academic development. According to Education Article \u00a711- 406 of the Annotated Code of Maryland, an institution that already has a program of cultural diversity must develop and implement a plan for improving the program. Several recommendations were made in last year's report to the board of trustees. The following are some outcomes. Expanded the annual diversity week program to include more co- curricular offerings by faculty and staff members. Enhanced advertisement methods were developed such as posters listing all events as well as individual events, listing links on the HCC website, listings on the HCC portal, announcements through emails and weekly highlights from the president as well as from diversity committee members. Volunteerism to help with each event demonstrates commitment, engagement, generosity, and passion. Began the development of the diversity working guide with tips for cultural sensitivity, inclusive language, and positioning for social justice. Coordinated programming on campus with topics including: campus climate, cultural competency, LGBTQIA concerns, immigration, implicit bias, international education, structural racism, and working with students with disabilities. Increased programmatic synergies with Ambiciones, Career Links, How ard P.R.I.D.E., Silas Craft Collegians, and Student Support Services. Sponsored four colloquium series: Modern African Literature, Middle Eastern Literature, Asian Literature, and anti -racism. Acquired new diversity training materials with a focus on the topics of cultural competence, gender equity and identity, intersectionality, unconscious bias, microaggressions, privilege, and social justice. Increased training for the diversity committee members and college community was offered including featured training on: Building Trust in Diverse Work Environments; Experiencing and Managing Imposter Syndrome; Microaggressions in the Workplace and Classroom; and Search Committee Procedures. Participated in statewide diversity roundtable meetings that have provided a strong platform for networking, as well as learning about other diversity programs. 210 Established the hate and bias incident response team as a subcommittee of the college's diversity committee to coordinate educational responses to incidents of hate and bias on- campus in conjunction with existing cross -functional teams that address behavioral interventions, student conduct, and employee well -being. While the HCC plan for diversity, equity, and inclusion is already very comprehensive, and is enhanced each year, there are some additional improvements that can be explored. The following are recommendations for improving HCC's plan for diversity, equity, and inclusion by May 1, 2022: 1) Implementing the revised plan for diversity, equity, and inclusion and committee policies to effectively position the committee as campus thought leaders in promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. 2) Increase outreach to areas and individuals in the college to promote future diversity training and workshops. Suggested topics in the upcoming academic year include immigration, cultural competency, drug use and abuse, diversity in the workplace, free speech, and intellectual discourse. 3) Increase online diversity training and programs to expand diversity training opportunities to a larger group of the college community. 4) Continue to seek out additional meeting times, locations, and partnerships for diversi ty events to accommodate the growing needs of the college. Staff meetings are also a possible time to hold a diversity activity, particularly for smaller offices where coverage may be an issue. 5) Continue supporting the office of student life and counseling and career services on \"Food for Thought,\" a monthly discussion series on diversity related topics for the campus community. 6) Continue the expansion of programming and outreach to increase students' exposure to historically black and minority serving institutions to include increased promotion of articulation agreements between Maryland's four HBCUs, additional college tours, and on-campus exposure. 7) Expand opportunities for faculty/staff discussions on diversity -related topics, including sponsoring faculty -led reading circles on topics of immigration, multicultural awareness, at -promise students, and privilege. 8) Implement key recommendations from interviews and surveys of minority employees by the human resources office and the diversity committee. Education Article \u00a711- 406 also requires the institution to describe its process for reporting campus -based hate crimes, as defined under Title 10, Subtitle 3 of the 211Criminal Law Article and consistent with federal requirements under 20 U.S.C. 1092(f), known as the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. HCC currently posts all campus crime s tatistics, including hate crimes, on its public web page in its Campus Crime Report, which can be found at http://www.howardcc.edu/services -support/public -safety/. The report shows the previous three years of data, during which time there were no reported hate crimes on campus. Finally, the statute asks each institution for a summary of any resources, including state grants, needed by the institution to effectively recruit and retain a culturally diverse student body. The following is a list of possible uses for grant money, which would help the college in its diversity initiatives: Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and critical language opportunities: Programs and scholarships that increase opportunities for under - represented students in STEM, and critical language programs. Assistive technology: Funding for educational technology that enhances learning and supports the access and success of students with disabilities. Transition to college/employment for students with disabilities : HCC provides support to a large number of students with disabilities, including a summer enrichment/transition program for high school students with disabilities and a career series program geared specifically for employment opportunities for the disabled. Additional funding would support the expansion of these programs as space is currently limited and the demand is rising consistently each year. Full funding for Student Support Service' s individualized academic support for low - income, first -generation college students: The college currently has a successful program to provide academic and personal support to disabled, low -income, and/or first-generation college students. During the previous grant cycle (2010- 2015), the base grant was flat -funded in 2010 and reduced annually by over five percent in subsequent funding years. The grant was flat -funded using fiscal year 2012 appropriations for the new grant cycle (2015- 2020). The program is currently being funded for one year by HCC, but the college must secure additional funding to cover the loss of federal funding during the 2020 grant competition. Child care : Additional funding will be needed to assist low -income and unemployed parents with supplementing the cost of child care. Early college awareness and preparedness programs: The college would like to build upon its outreach efforts to include students in the younger grades, including upper elementary through the ninth grade. Grant funding to expand this effort would be particularly helpful for youth who are first -generation college students, those from low-income homes, foster children, Title I schools, and others who may be 212disadvantaged from an early age to recognize that college is a possibility for them. Programs could take many forms such as but not limited to, on campus summer programs, partnering with county health and nutrition programs to integrate preventative health care into early college awareness, cohort groups where youth advance to college as a cohort starting from the fourth or fifth grade, tutoring and mentoring, parental and parent -child educational programs, camp scholarships, and transportation. Programs that promote persistence to postsecondary education are critical. A progress report on implementation of the recommendations in this report will be prepared for submission to the Maryland Higher Education Commission by September 1, 2021. 213MONTGOMERY COLLEGE CULTURAL DIVERSITY REPORT Our College Roadmap for Ensuring and Sustaining Diversity and Inclusive Excellence ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT JULY 2021 214 Dr. DeRionne P. Pollard President ________________________________________________ The Honorable Michael J. Knapp Chair, Board of Trustees MONTGOMERY COLLEGE CULTURAL DIVERSITY REPORT 215MONTGOMERY COLLEGE ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT ON PROGRAMS OF THE CULTURAL DIVERSITY PLAN June 2021 Section 1: A description of how the institution defines diversity (no more than one page); how did the institution develop that definition (e.g., processes, sources, and guidance used)? Description of how the institution defines diversity: Montgomery College is committed to becoming an equity -minded institution. Advancing social justice, cr eating a sense of belonging and addressing systemic inequities are bedrocks of Montgomery College's commitment to student success and institutional cultural competency. Institutional Cultural Competency is a best practice for valuing diversity, practicing inclusion, and creating equity. Cultural competency enables our organization to acquire the wisdom and develop capabilities for critically examining our institutional and social policies and how cultural worldviews influence perceptions of power, dominance , and inequality. Studies show that investing time and resources to organization -wide cultural competency efforts is positively related to greater innovation, performance, success, problem solving, talent acquisition, and market share. The College operates under a more comprehensive framework that is broader than the term \"diversity\". Cultural competency is the state of having and applying knowledge and skill in five areas: awareness of one's own cultural worldview; recognition of one's a ttitudes toward cultural differences; realization of different cultural practices and worldviews; reflective practices and improvement ; and thoughtfulness in cross -cultural interaction. Moreover, the College's cultural competency definition and commitment align with the best practice guidance from the National Center for Cultural Competence and the seminal works of Terry Cross and others who identi fy five essential elements contributing to an institution's ability to become more culturally competent: 1. Valu ing diversity. 2. Having the capacity for cultural self -assessment. 3. Being conscious of the dynamics inherent when cultures interact. 4. Having institutionalized culture knowledge. 5. Having developed adaptations to service delivery reflecting an understanding of cu ltural diversity. Through the President's Advisory Committee on Equity and Inclusion (PACEI), the College participated in a series of focus groups and town Hall meetings to develop consensus around our definitions, including how we define diversity. Diversity is defined as: Individual differences (e.g. personality, language, learning styles and life experiences) and group -social differences (e.g. race, ethnicity, class, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual identity, disability, country of origin and ability status as well as cultural, political, religious or other affiliations) that can be engaged in the service of learning. Sources and guidance used to develop the definition: Development. https://nccc.georgetown.edu/curricula/culturalc ompetence.html Also adapted in part by Cal State College, National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education, Webster's Dictionary/Association of American Colleges and Universities Achieving the Dream. https://achievingthedream.org APPROVED B Y President's Advisory Committee on Equity and Inclusion 1-10- 18; Revised 12-1-19, Revised 4 -28-20, Revised 6/3/20, Sharon Bland, Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer Section 2: A brief (no more than one page) highlight of the most successful ongoing and new institutional initiatives designed to address issues related to cultural diversity within the campus and the broader community, and how their efficacy is measured; The President's Advisory Committee on Equity and Inclusion (PACEI) was initiated in Nov ember 2017 with the goal to create and implement an Equity and Inclusion roadmap for the college. This committee is comprised of diverse multigenerational and multicultural stakeholders including faculty, staff, administrators, and students. Ultimately, PA CEI identified 5 priority goals to focus on for the next 5 years (i.e., 2020-2025) based on a three -year prior equity and inclusion internal and external review and research of the College's operations. The goals include: 1. Improve persistence, retention, and completion/graduation/transfer of all students, particularly African American male and Latinx students. 2. Improve employee recruitment, hiring, on -boarding development, and training procedures and practices to attract and retain a diverse workforce that i ncludes leaders, managers, faculty, and staff reflective of the college's diverse student population. 3. Foster college culture of equity, inclusion, civility, accessibility, kindness, trust, and respect for human dignity through targeted programs, activities , and educational opportunities. 2164. Integrate relevant and equitable multicultural teaching practices that infuse international/multicultural awareness into the educational experience, classrooms, and curriculum. 5. Support diversity and inclusion in our staff, faculty, students, community, and business population. Provide increased opportunities for the college's communities to foster equity and economic empowerment. Currently, the five sub -committees on PACEI corresponded to the five priority goals of the College. In an effort to strategically implement the goals, in August 2020 each of the four Senior Vice Presidents identified 2 -3 objectives from the roadmap that they wanted their unit to prioritize for FY21; similarly, each sub -committee also identified 3 -5 objectives from the Roadmap for Success to prioritize for FY21, along with measurable outcomes for each objective, estimated budget, specific activity/task(s), target start and finish dates, and selected monitor(s) for the progress of the specific objective. The objectives were to be implemented during the FY21 academic year (Appendix B), with the understanding that five new/different objectives will be identified from the Roadmap for Success (Appendix A) and implemented for the upcoming FY22 fiscal year w hile monitoring the continued progress of FY21 goals. Collegewide Dialogues The Office of Equity and Inclusion (OEI) leads collegewide discussions and programs in this space. OEI has developed the Let's Talk! Series, which are dialogue sessions designed to address the current and breaking issues of the day, nationally, locally, and statewide. At the beginning of the COVID -19 pandemic, we pivoted to a completely virtual model to deliver this programming. OEI developed and uses its Cycle of Change Model to evaluate its dialogues. The evaluations are distributed after each session and their results are tabulated and reviewed to determine effects of the discussions. OEI also virtually launched the Social Justice Inclusive Leadership Institute in the Spring (M arch-May 2021) with a cohort of 24 students. It was so successful that we followed it up with a SJILI Summer Session (May -June 2021) with a cohort of 15 students. This programming will continue as in -person programming once the College resumes in -person le arning. Community Engagement Roundtables The College hosts quarterly roundtables with more than two dozen community groups to increase community engagement while addressing issues of cultural diversity, understanding, and student barriers. In these roundt ables, partners have provided significant guidance on how the College can address cultural diversity and understanding with its students and the community as a whole. These partners have also given feedback on strategic and master plans to ensure that the lenses of diversity, equity, and inclusion are incorporated into major initiatives. Section 3: A brief (no more than one page) discussion of the ways in which the institution anticipates COVID-19 most affecting- either negatively or positively - its effor ts to enhance diversity on its campus or campuses. This may include, for example, acknowledgement of issues such as disproportionate impacts on retention and graduation among certain populations; the shift t o distance education modalities limiting the abil ity to provide in -person programming; or, in contrast, the shift to online education providing opportunity for more students to access diversity programming. The Office of Academic Affairs Some of the Office of Academic Affairs' most successful efforts to address and enhance cultural diversity within the campus and broader community are achieved through partnerships. The College recognizes a community need, partners with others to address the nee d, develops a program to address the need - all of which grow enrollment, especially from underserved communities. Recognizing that many retail and hospitality employees lost their jobs during COVID: The College partnered with WorkSource Montgomery and GlaxoSmithKline to develop a Biotech Boot Camp which ran in January 2021 to train this population to work on vaccine manufacturing and distribution locally. This pilot program was successful and will be scaled up to meet local needs for those workers displaced by the pandemic. In addition, the College's Workforce Devel opment and Continuing Education unit has developed and marketed short -term training opportunities which will also support displaced workers from hard- hit industries. Divisional Conversations on Social Injustice and Systemic Racism The Office of Advancemen t and Community Engagement launched a series of a dozen conversations over FY'21 for its 77 employees and student workers regarding social injustice and systemic racism. Through these dialogues employees have become more mindfu l of the lived experiences of others, learned new resources for educating themselves about social injustice, and provided more than 25 recommendations for the consideration of the President's Advisory Council on Equity and Inclusion (PACEI). The efficacy of th e program is in its high participation rate (>90%) and the number of new ideas for expanding cultural diversity and understanding. a. Impact of COVID on campus diversity Remote teaching and learning make MC more accessible to all, eliminating the need for multiple buses, and othe r duplicative efforts. There are limited impacts on the TP/SS Campus, as 75% of students are people of color. The exception is the possible impact on the number of F -1 visa students, which is less than 5% of campus enrollment. 217 Funding levels will remain th e same or increase for programming and other services for the Institute for Racial Justice and Civic Engagement. Expanded programing at all three campuses is anticipated for the Center and will be enhanced via webinars and other virtual delivery mechanisms . Increased diverse academic programming will be delivered via new streaming equipment installed in the Cultural Arts Center during the pandemic. Larger audiences are anticipated. b. Shift to online At the same time Montgomery College moved to a structure d remote and fully online schedule as a result of the pandemic, there was a growing focus by faculty to look at decolonizing their curriculum and engage in culturally responsive teaching. Faculty continued to explore the use of Open Educational Resources t o bring in different cultural voices, providing opportunities for all students at Montgomery College to see themselves in the course content. The importance of the shift to online education meant that more students had access to this type of diversity content. Students who may have had trouble attending classes on -campus because of work obligations, family responsibilities, transportation issues, or physical limitations now had access to education. As a result, they too had access to wide range of educational opportunities, both academic and co -curricular. Students could participate in virtual student clubs and events and connect with other like -minded students, all because they now could take classes online. Positive ways Covid -19 has impacted the College Remote status has been effective for emotional support and understanding of the cultural shifts that have occurred in that mo re people appear to be understanding and empathetic Enhanced accessibility via remote tools Increased number of graduates and stude nt success Access to services has been increased and less taxing for some students Increase of instructors and students from other countries and parts of the US Negative ways Covid -19 has impacted the College Populations of students who do not have the nec essary resources to manage on their own Public transportation cuts and delays in bus and train service during the height of the pandemic created mobility challenges Problematic for ESOL students, traditional ways of reaching certain communities in person w ere not able to occur Direct community outreach and engagement did not occur (tied to above) Employees with disabilities, ADA increase with vision and dexterity issues have increased as a result of remote work Inability to have face to face awareness and outreach programs on campus which limited the number of students who received outreach information around diversity In addition to these narratives, each institution should provide, as an appendix, a copy of the diversity plan in place durin g the reportin g year (Academic Year 2020 -2021). This should be the plan approved by the institution's Board on or before July 1, 2020. Note that the required elements of this plan are defined in \u00a711 -406 of the Education Article.

Appendix B - Civility NormsOFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS 221montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 3Over the past two years, our president, Dr. DeRionne Pollard, has led the College on a journey of discovery around radical inclusion. As part of the Achieving the Dream network, we are focused on student equity. To ensure that we are our best selves in the delivery of student success, we all, as a college community, want to better understand the landscape of our student population and to educate ourselves on incoming equity issues. As Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer, I would like to thank you for your commitment to the work of building and fostering a college culture of which we can all be proud. I want t o also express my appreciation for all of your work in supporting the Office of Equity and Inclusion and the efforts of the President's Advisory Committee on E quity and Inclusion (PACEI). PACEI represents employees and students at all levels of the College. Together we are working hard to ensure Montgomery College is a civil, inclusive, welcoming, safe, accessible, equitable, and affirming community. We deliberately embarked on a twenty-month strategic planning process that pr oduced more than 80 recommendations, many of which have found residence in this Roadmap. Some of the recommendations are also reflected in the Montgomery College 2020-2025 Strategic Plan, wher e you will see the principles of equity and inclusion embedded therein. The President's Advisory Committee on Equity and Inclusion is an important leadership resource in advancing such work and the Equity and Inclusion Roadmap for Success 2020-2025 will guide our work in this space. MC is committed to becoming an equity-minded institution. We seek to AIM HIGH and commit to amplify, integrate, and measure our work. By working together, I am confident we will continue to pursue equitable student outcomes, inclusive excellence in teaching and learning, and fair and inclusiv e employee experiences, and we will raise our institution to a level of civility of which we can all be proud. I also want to say thank you to all of those who have provided me the time to listen and speak to your staff regarding civility, one of the key tenets of our Code of Ethics that we are continuing to uphold this year. At every turn, the work that we do as College employees contributes to creating and sustaining a healthy and safe teaching, learning, and working environment that is inclusive and equity-minded. During this crazy time in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, the College has truly embraced and propelled our work through the delivery of services via remote teaching and work. In uplifting our focus on equity and inclusion, I invite you to reimagine our College's mission as such:We empower our students (in an equitable and inclusive manner) to change their liv es, and we enrich the life of our community (in an equitable and inclusive manner). We are accountable for our results (in an equitable and inclusive manner). Sincerely, Shar on R.

OUR VISION With a sense of urgency for the future, Montgomery College will be a national model of educational excellence, opportunity, and student success. Our organization will be characterized by agility and relevance as it meets the dynamic challenges facing our students and community. OUR VALUES excellence | int egrity | inno vation equity & inclusion | stewar dship MISSIONAs stated on the Montgomery College homepage, MC has grown into an institution where radical inclusion\u2014that is, deeply rooted values of welcoming all individuals who seek higher education or continuing education\u2014is an essential element of our identity. By intentionally cultivating our campuses as places where equal education and employment opportunity flourish, we have advanced our own educational mission, contributed t o the aspirations of Montgomery County, and added to the vision of our nation. We are here to ensure that ever y student\u2014regardless of ability, background, economic status, race, or age\u2014has access t o higher education. One of our main challenges is to focus on equity in successful outcomes. This means that we provide all students, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds who typically don't perform as well in college, with the assistance, opportunities, and tools not just to attend college but to effectively reach their goals. Our job is to ensure that everyone has the ability to achieve success by redesigning our institutions to achieve those outcomes. Montgomery College faculty and staff have gone to great lengths to create robust learning environments in which all persons feel safe voicing their perspectives and where intellectual rigor is the basis for engaging across difference. The College will continue to affirm the rights of all persons to study and pursue opportunity through education free fr om fear and distraction. Our institution will continue to be a place where inclusion and diversity thrives, and where difference is celebrated.I. Montgomery College Mission, Vision, and Core Values 225montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 7 II. Introduction Creating equitable and inclusive experiences starts with each of us. Advancing social justice, creating a sense of belonging, and addressing systemic inequities are bedrocks of Montgomery College's commitment to student success and institutional cultural competency. Institutional Cultural Competency is a best practice for valuing diversity, practicing inclusion, and creating equity. MC boasts 55,000 students from more than 160 countries. Our employees are also diverse. As such, we are committed to both cultural competency and racial equity for all. Cultural competency enables our organization to acquire the wisdom and develop capabilities for critically examining our institutional and social policies and how cultural worldviews influence perceptions of power, dominance, and inequality. Studies show that investing time and resources to organization-wide cultural competency efforts is positively related to greater innovation, performance, success, problem solving, talent acquisition, and market share. The College defines cultural competency as the state of having and applying knowledge and skill in five areas: awareness of one's own cultural worldview; r ecognition of one's attitudes toward cultural differences; realization of different cultural practices and worldviews; reflective practices and improv ement; and thoughtfulness in cross-cultural interaction. Racial equity is defined as the condition that would be achieved if one's racial identity no longer pr edicted, in a statistical sense, how one fares. When we use the term, we are thinking about racial equity as one part of racial justice, and thus we also include work t o address root causes of inequities not just their manifestation. This includes elimination of policies, practices, attitudes, and cultural messages that reinforce differential outcomes by rail or fail to eliminate them. 1 The National Center for Cultural Competence and the seminal works of Terry Cross (The Cross Model of Cultural Competence, 1988) and others identify five essential elements contributing to an institution's ability t o become more culturally competent: Valuing diversity. Having the capacity for cultural self-assessment. Being conscious of the dynamics inherent when cultures interact. Having institutionalized cultural knowledge. Having developed adaptations to service delivery reflecting an understanding of cultural diversity. This Roadmap for Success has been written to guide the College through its work in advancing and embedding equity and inclusion throughout teaching and learning and in each of our divisions, departments, and administrative units. The Office of Equity and Inclusion will be tracking its progress and pr oviding annual updates to the College community. We invite each member of the College community to partner with us to insur e implementation.III. Office of Equity and Inclusion We live in a world of complex tensions that can have significant impact on our communities. But when we come to work\u2014the place where we spend the majority of our time\u2014we often don't openly address these topics. \u2014 Excerpt from CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, ceoaction.com In 2013, Dr. Michelle T. Scott, deputy chief of staff/chief strategy officer, created a report that described a \"reimagined office of equity and diversity.\" While some of Dr. Scott's recommendations were implemented, others are being incorporated int o this new model. In 2016, the Office of Equity and Inclusion (OEI) was approved b y the Board of Trustees. In 2017, the inaugural chief equity and inclusion officer was hired to report directly to the president. While steps to address inequity have been taken at the College, differences in opportunities and rights still exist. We seek pro-active approaches t o uplifting Montgomery College's welcoming community, which is open to all students, faculty, and staff\u2014regardless of race, gender, disability, religion, or sexual orientation. We each bring unique experiences and perspectives to the College that are v alued; diminishing the rights of any group harms our community. Likewise, while exclusion persists, we strive to challenge its every occurrence. The Office of Equity and Inclusion's many goals and strategies outlined in this document include educating and enhancing student, staff, and faculty awareness of personal bias through inclusion training, which has been added for all onboar ding and training programs. In collaboration with offices throughout the College, we will continue to create forums that pro vide education, dialogue, community engagement, and celebration for all to enjoy through: 1) dialogue sessions, 2) an annual Equity Summit, 3) the annual Excellence in Equity awards, 4) \"One MC\" Book Club, 5) MCTV equity and inclusion progr amming, 6) student professional development panels, and 7) E&I Pop-ups, which are either virtual or campus-based events occurring in small groups and more. We work to improv e Montgomery College's culture of civility and collaboration and people stewardship by enriching human working r elationships, peer coaching, and in-house consulting and faciliation services. Research shows that diversity increases creativity and innovation, promotes higher quality decisions, and enhances economic growth. \"You can't talk your way into equity, something actually has to be done... It takes action.\" \u2014Dr. Eric Benjamin, collegewide dean of education and social sciences, July 9, 2019 1Center for Assessment and Policy Development. racialequitytools.org 2268MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS IV. Equity and Inclusion Goals, Philosophy, and Purpose GOALS PHILOSOPHY AND PURPOSE GOAL ONE Improve persistence, retention, and completion/ graduation/transfer of all students, particularly African American male and Latinx students.Student success is at the heart of our mission. MC's data indicates that Black males graduate at the lowest rate: the 2014 and 2015 Integrated Post-Secondary Data System (IPEDS) student cohorts at Montgomery College reflected 8.1% and 8.4% graduation rates, respectively , and for Latinx 16.4% and 17.4%, respectively , versus 23% and 22% graduation rates for the College ov erall. For the fall 2018 cohort, more than half (53.4%) of the 352 American-born Black males had a grade point average of less than 2.0; almost a quar ter of the group had a grade point average of 0.0; for Latinx, it was 40.4% of the 1,189 students with a grade point aver age of less than 2.0; 16.4% of the group had a grade point average of 0.0. The IPEDS cohort is the number of first-time, full-time, degree-seeking students. According to the Student Success Score Card for fall 2014 by the Office of Institutional Research and Effectiv eness, overall the Black student population, 490 students, graduated at 14.9%, and 513 Latinx students graduated at 18.1%. MC's goal is to achieve seamless access, completion, and transfer for all students by removing systemic barriers and integrating classroom experiences and holistic support systems that are key to student success. GOAL TWO Improve employee recruitment, hiring, on- boarding, development, and training procedures and practices to attract and retain a diverse workforce that includes leaders, managers, faculty, and staff reflective of the College's diverse student population.Cultivating a culture of equity and inclusion, continuous learning, civility , and mutual respect is key to institutional success. MC's goal is to create opportunities for all employees to grow professionally and to retain the intellectual capital necessary to achieve our commitment to student success. GOAL THREE Foster college culture of equity, inclusion, civility, accessibility, kindness, trust, and respect for human dignity through targeted programs, activities, and educational opportunities.Building a positive, welcoming, and compassionate culture helps improve morale, increases productivity, creates a sense of belonging, and facilitates success for all. MC's goal is to create an environment free of bullying, retaliation, and negative biases that impede student success, overall morale, productivity, and community building. 227montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 9 GOALS PHILOSOPHY AND PURPOSE GOAL FOUR Integrate relevant and equitable multicultural teaching practices that infuse international/multicultural awareness into the educational experience, classrooms, and curriculum.Faculty interactions with students are crucial to student success. MC's goal is to expand successful, culturally relevant teaching pedagogies to provide students with the strongest foundation of knowledge and global awareness. The purpose of this goal is to keep students engaged and prepare them for completion, transfer, and careers. GOAL FIVE Support diversity and inclusion in our staff, faculty, students, community, and business populations. Provide increased opportunities for the College's communities to foster equity and economic empowerment.Education and market-relevant skills are key to individual and county economic success. MC's goal is to mobilize local and regional partnerships that effectively respond to labor market needs and to expand economic opportunity for our students and to all county residents. Building and sustaining academic, industry, and broad-based community partnerships are key to advancing educational opportunities for chronically underserved and under-engaged populations. MC's goal is to deepen connections among College employees and students and the broader diverse communities we serve through organized, strategic, and culturally responsive efforts. 22810MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS V. MC Equity and Inclusion Roadmap Purpose and Institutional Framework Inclusion: The active, intentional, and ongoing engagement with diversity\u2014in people, in the curriculum, in the co-curriculum, and in communities (intellectual, social, cultural, geographical) with which individuals might connect\u2014in ways that increase one's awareness, content knowledge, cognitive sophistication, and empathic understanding of the complex ways individuals interact within (and change) systems and institutions. Diversity: Individual differences (e.g., personality, language, learning styles, and life experiences) and group-social differences (e.g., race, ethnicity, class, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, sexual identity, disability, country of origin, and ability status as well as cultural, political, religious, or other affiliations) that can be engaged in the service of learning. Historically underserved or underrepresented populations include but are not limited to: first generation; low income; students of color; adult students; disabilities; students with dependents; foster care youth; and formerly and currently incarcerated students.Equity (student focus): The creation of opportunities and intentional design of the College experience for each student, particularly historically underserved populations to ensure, preserve participation in, and provide equal access to educational programs that are capable of closing the achievement gaps in student success and completion. Equity (employee focus): The creation of opportunities for historically underserved populations of employees (faculty and staff) to have equal access to professional growth opportunities and resource networks that are capable of closing the demographic disparities in leadership roles in all spheres of institutional functioning. Equity (business focus): The creation of opportunities for historically underserved and local businesses to have equal access to the College's procurement and partner relationships. Access: Convenience, affordable, proximity, provide equal opportunities for persons with disabilities to all aspects of campus life, non-selective, local postsecondary, multiple pathways to the College. Leadership: Motivating a group of people to act toward achieving common goals and developing and implementing strategies to meet the College's mission. Social Justice: Social justice is a concept of fair and just relations between the individual and society, as measured by the distribution of wealth, opportunities for personal activity, and social privileges. The concept of social justice has often referred to the process of ensuring that individuals fulfill their societal roles and receive what was their due fr om society. In the current movements for social justice, the emphasis has been on the breaking of barriers for social mobility, the creation of safety nets, and economic justice. Social justice assigns rights and duties in the institutions of society, (i.e., education, in efforts for gender, ethnic, and social equality, for advocating justice for migrants, prisoners, the environment, and the physically and developmentally disabled, which enables people Inclusion DiversityEquity for students and employees Equity for business and community partners Access and achievementLeadership Social justice The College's philosophical and operational framework guiding the Roadmap is IDEEALS1 1montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion/index.html 229montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 11 to receive the basic benefits and burdens of cooperation... to ensure fair distribution of wealth and equal opportunity . We use this framework, rooted in cultural competency, to equip Montgomery College to successfully navigate the dynamics of diff erence, authentically partner with others, maximize creative potential, and align our intent with our outcomes. IDEEALS is the lens embedded throughout the goals, objectives, and recommendations within this Roadmap. The purpose of this Roadmap is to promote and foster an engaging, equitable, and inclusive collegewide community for teaching, learning, and working. We do this work in a collaborative, culturally relevant, shar ed governance manner that embraces civility and mutual respect. All of this work is undergirded by a speak-up culture in a supportive environment. We will continue to address and monitor the areas of improv ement identified through our analysis, which followed a process of interviews with emplo yees, administering two equity and inclusion climate surveys, a \"Start, Stop, Sustain\" review of existing work, and conducting town halls and focus groups to collect f eedback and suggestions that determined priorities for the Roadmap . As part of the Achieving the Dream network, we are implementing system-wide strategies focused on increasing graduation, transfer, and retention rates and closing achievement gaps among our diverse student populations, including students of color and low-income populations. Our work has focused on comprehensive advising, scheduling for student success, Start Smart, and Guided Pathways through an equity and inclusion lens. Additionally, the College has ramped up our efforts in Achieving Collegiate Excellence and Success (ACES), building upon established partnerships with Montgomery County Public Schools and the Universities at Shady Grove, K-12 students generally, and community-based organizations aimed at getting students in the door early and increasing enrollment through programs such as Early College and Middle College. The College has also expanded the Achieving the Promise Academy (ATPA) academic coaching program to facilitate student success; the program currently includes more than 5,500 students and 40 coaches in 193 embedded sections, and 825 students with one-on-one coaches. Areas of improvement include: closing our achievement gap and incoming student graduation rates, as well as intentionally implementing programs that foster an awareness and appreciation for individuals from diverse backgrounds; recognizing the intersectionality of diversity; diversifying our workforce by hiring employees who reflect our student demographics; building highly functioning teams; embracing an ethical culture that obser ves, measures, and rewards successes and fosters trust in leadership and among colleagues; providing employees with opportunities to be heard in spaces that are safe for sharing; sustaining and ramping up initiatives that continue to establish an equitable environment; and better communicating our work and successes. Montgomery College is moving along in our journey to achieve our desired equity and inclusion outcomes over the next six years. Our Montgomery College 2020-2025 Strategic Plan focuses on the following goals: I. Empower students to start smart and succeed. II. Enhance transformational teaching practices and learning environments. III. Fuel the economy and drive economic mobility. IV . Build, engage, strengthen, and tend to community partnerships. V. Invest in our employees. VI. Protect affordability. 230As a College, our paramount focus on education requires us to constantly consider how to teach our students about the world and give them the tools to understand and navigate it\u2014whether assessing complex principles of physics or the complicated history of race in our society. 231montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 13 VI. PACEI Overview The President's Advisory Committee on Equity and Inclusion (PACEI) is a multicultural, multi-generational team of faculty, staff, and administrators whose membership represents all facets of the College. PACEI seeks input from various collegewide student organizations. PACEI is led by Sharon Bland, chief equity and inclusion officer, and Dr. Debra Bright, chair. It was created in Nov ember 2017 at the behest of Dr. Pollard, as a 50-person committee. PACEI's purpose is as an advisory group to the president and her Senior Administrative Leadership Team (SAL T) in the areas of equity, inclusion, social justice, and diversity. PACEI serves to: Promote cross-cultural understanding, communication, and cultur al competence among students and employees. Gather, analyze, and monitor r elevant information and data concerning equity and inclusion and recommend specific actions and proposals for achieving and enhancing equity and inclusion. Recognize excellence in equity, inclusiv e excellence, and awareness and promotion of equitable and inclusive outcomes. Facilitate timely dialogue and communication about equity and inclusion issues affecting students, faculty, administr ators, and staff. Advise the president on internal concerns that emerge at Montgomer y College. Each committee member was chosen by Dr. Pollard after an application process, which was motivated by previous criticism that the same people were chosen again and again to serve on collegewide committees. The committee divided into the following eight subcommittees to undertake its work: Student Experience and College Culture Business Practices and Procurement combined with W orkforce Development and Community Engagement Disability Inclusion Faculty, T eaching, and Curriculum Human Resources/Recruiting, Hiring, Retention, Succession Planning Nationwide Peer Institution Best Practices/Assessment and Ev aluation/Resources Reports and Communication Training, Dialogue, Ev ents, and CelebrationsIn 2019, Dr. Pollard appointed senior vice president (SVP) liaisons from each area overseen by a senior vice president. Their responsibility is to work directly with each division senior vice president on matters relating to equity and inclusion. SVP liaisons endeavor to ensure barriers to equal access are identified and addressed, and inclusiveness is represented in all aspects of life and study throughout Montgomer y College, in every academic discipline, administrative unit, and community partnership. The chairs/co-chairs of the subcommittees, as well as the liaisons to each senior vice president, constitute the PACEI Leadership Team. The chair of PACEI has ably guided the leadership team's and larger committee's work to help ensure our initiatives are moving forward. Since its inception, PACEI has made many noteworthy accomplishments. Committee members have: Analyzed data from various collegewide sur veys and student focus groups and used these data to develop a list of proposed activities the College should \"Start, Stop, and Sustain.\" Participated in and/or facilitated a wide variety of div ersity trainings on topics such as civility, unconscious bias, and microaggressions. Planned and executed the College's inaugur al Equity Summit and Equity Dialogue events. Established and educated the college community on new MC Civility Norms. Initiated a #YouAreW elcomeHere campaign. Created a \"Strength in Diversity\" statement for inclusion on the collegewide syllabus template. Established an Excellence in Equity awards pr ogram to recognize faculty, staff, administrators, and students who have demonstrated exemplary accomplishments in advancing equity, inclusion, and diversity at Montgomery College. Additionally, the committee submitted 82 recommendations to Dr. Pollard and SAL T for implementation, and those recommendations have either been accomplished or are moving forward. (See Appendix A). In the coming years, PACEI members will help shepherd the implementation of the goals and objectives outlined in this Roadmap for Success. The committee will also continue to serve as an ongoing advisory body to the president on critical E&I issues. 23214MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS VII. Institutional Assessment and Surveys, P ACEI Subcommittees' Research and Data Since PACEI's first meeting in November 2017, members have participated in a variety of trainings on t opics such as: courageous conversations, unconscious bias, mastering civility, and interrupting microaggressions. Additionally, we have been working diligently to review existing data and to determine ways in which we can make our community more equitable and inclusive. Over the past two years, PACEI analyzed the results of various surveys, including both the 2017 and 2018 Equity and Inclusion Survey and results of the 2017 and 2019 Pizza for Your Thoughts student focus groups. In both surveys, we learned that MC has clear strengths that benefit our students and our workplace. This is a testament to the spirit and energy our employees bring to work each day. We also learned that we face challenges that we need to over come and we must work together to do so. Pizza for Your Thoughts showed us that students juggle various responsibilities that require time management, prioritizing, and support. Students thought MC was diverse and understanding but also thought that there could be more opportunities for non-traditional students, such as seminars on how to balance work and school. We have learned that we need to strengthen parts of our culture, processes, policies, and leadership effectiv eness at all levels of our organization. Some employees told us they are working at an outstanding college and that they love their jobs and work environment. Others described various barriers that frustrate them and their efforts to perform their jobs effectively. For some employees, it depends on to whom they report. We have sev eral top-notch managers and others who can become more effective as managers and even leaders. For many employees, cumbersome and ineffective processes and practices or technology get in the way. Unfortunately, other employees said they fear possible retribution from their managers for speaking out and recommending improvements. Such behavior is never acceptable at MC. The transformation will require many changes, hard work, and the hands-on involvement of ever yone at MC. Working together, we can and will enhance equity and inclusion for all employees and students. Based on a re view of the College's previous Diversity Plan 2013-2020, we successfully completed over 80% of the action items identified. Moreov er, we have been deliberate about becoming laser focused on equitable student outcomes and have implemented policies and practices t o not only remove barriers to success but to strengthen and amplify solutions we know are working. Since that diversity plan was written, we have become a part of the Achieving the Dream (ATD) network. ATD is a national reform network that serves as a catalyst for improvement by helping colleges to build their capacity to close achievement gaps and ensure that more students complete college and have more opportunity for economic success (www.achievingthedream.org). It is important that we communicate to the college community how each employee can affect the success of our students. To date, one of our most significant accomplishments has been the Achieving Collegiate Excellence and Success (ACES) collabor ation with Montgomery County Public Schools and the Universities at Shady Grove. Now serving more than 2,300 students, ACES provides a pathway to college completion for local students from minority, low-income, and first-generation- to-college segments, r esulting in improved high school and college graduation rates, higher retention in college, and better grade point averages, compared to their peers. Despite the College's work to create an environment of racial inclusion, equity, and access, we have encountered obstacles that have slowed our progress in improving the outcomes of our Black, Latinx, and other students of color. PACEI reviewed several data management tools, including Office of Institutional Research and Performance Accountability Repor t (PAR) data, as well as IPEDS data. For example, many of these students have needed to take developmental courses in English and mathematics before they can earn college credits, thus increasing their costs and lengthening their time to degree completion. English and math faculty worked diligently to redesign the developmental course sequence to not just improve student completion but to help close any gaps that existed between some historically underserved populations. Over the past three years we have seen substantial improvement in the gateway math and English courses. Using IPEDS race/ethnicity definitions, early indications show that we will have more students completing gatewa y courses in general. In the first semester of the academic year 2019-2020, 15% of the first-time ever in college (FTEIC) Black/African American students completed gateway math, whereas in the entire academic year 2016-2017 only 15% Black/African 233montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 15 American students completed gateway math. There are similar positive results for Hispanic students, in that 19% of the first-time ever in college (FTEIC) Hispanic students completed gateway math in the first semester, whereas in the entire academic year 2016-2017 only 19% of Hispanic students completed gateway math. Additionally, by focusing on P AR cohort data for the same years, we expect to see similar increases in students' performance using both the tools we have implemented, outlined in Academic Affairs and Student Affairs, coupled with recommendations listed in this Roadmap. In addition, we have learned that students still face obstacles related to basic needs, such as food and housing security, and other needs such as childcare and transportation. To foster success by supporting students' mental and physical health wellness that can impact students' academic success, the Student Health and Wellness Center for Success, established in 2017 (SHaW), identifies, provides, and connects students to resources that suppor t student success. Furthermore, over the last few years, the College's investment in Early College, Middle College, and Dual Enrollment has provided more opportunities for Montgomery County Public School students to obtain college credit while in high school and even simultaneously complete an associate's degree and earn a high school diploma. Additionally, we have learned the importance of collaborating with our county public school district on targeted college-readiness activities designed to engage students and families as early as high school (For more information: https://montgomerycollege.edu/documents/offices/student-affairs/student-affairs-master-plan.pdf). As a result, MC's college success pr ograms offer tutoring, college visits, and assistance with navigating college admission and financial aid applications. We know we have room to improv e. Based on a series of SWOT (strengths-weaknesses-opportunity-thr eats) analyses of Montgomery College' s equity and inclusion efforts collected in 2017-2019 through the College's data sources using surveys and focus groups with various College constituencies, PACEI and the Office of Equity and Inclusion (OEI) was provided an opportunity to identify gaps and appropriate action items which ha ve been included in this 2020-2025 Equity and Inclusion Roadmap for Success. According to the SWOT analyses, MC's strengths included: strong leadership; employees who ar e genuinely dedicated to the College's mission; a diverse student body; the creation of PACEI to champion diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts; multicultural programming, events, and presentations; film series, etc., geared towards students, employ ees, and the surrounding communities; and well-established partnerships with MCPS and other nonprofits and local businesses. After reviewing the data, each subcommittee also developed a list of proposed activities that the College should \"Start, Stop, and Sustain.\" The next section pro vides an overview of each PACEI subcommittee's mission, vision, objectives, outcomes, and indicators followed by PACEI general recommendations. 234As an educational institution, we play an important role in helping our community understand how to build bridges at challenging moments, broaden perspectives through interaction, and uphold a fundamental optimism in individuals' capacity to grow. 235montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 17 VIII.

This mission coincides with the Seven Truths and is supported in the Student Affairs Master Plan (StAMP) and the Academic Master Plan (AMP). Vision: Our vision for an equity-minded college culture is rooted in the College's philosophical and operational frameworks for cultural competency, which is inclusion, diversity, and equity for all students; equity for all employees; access; leadership; and social justice. This framework equips the College to successfully navigate the dynamics of difference, authentically partner with others, maximize creative potential, and align our intent with our outcomes. The work of the Student Experience and College Culture subcommittee is undergirded by the Seven Truths for a Common Student Experience, outlined in the Student Affairs Master Plan (StAMP), as well as the operational definitions of equity and inclusion. The seven truths ar e: 1) Start Smart; 2) Maintain a Foundation of Support Opportunities; 3) Get Connected; 4) Build Community; 5) Enhance the Classroom Experience; 6) Encourage Student Success Every Step of the Way; and 7) Plan to Cross the Finish Line. The student focus of equity centers on the creation of opportunities for historically underser ved populations to have equal access to and participation in educational programs that are capable of closing the achievement gaps in student success and improving retention and completion. Inclusion incorporates the active, intentional, and ongoing engagement with diversity\u2014in people, in the curriculum, in the co-curriculum, and in the communities (intellectual, social, cultural, geographical) with which individuals might connect\u2014in ways that increase one's awareness, content knowledge, cognitive sophistication, and empathetic understanding of complex ways that individuals interact within (and change) systems and institutions. It is important to note that although students are at the heart of our efforts at Montgomery College, the role of the President's Advisory Committee on Equity and Inclusion is structured to focus on the broader Montgomery College community to include employees and our business partners.The overarching goal is to remove barriers, seen and unseen, from the path of students new to the culture, climate, and expectations at Montgomery College. We recognize and appreciate the direct connection between our students and our employees' experiences and that MC's college cultur e overall directly impacts the quality of those experiences. Additionally, we must continue to spotlight the mental health needs of our students and employees. Learning can be compromised without this awareness. Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death amongst young adults between 15-24 (Suicide Statistics and Facts. Suicide Awareness Voices of Education (SAVE) website. Published 2019). Inequities that are being experienced throughout the COVID 19 pandemic, increased violence towards people of color, and increased unemployment for millions of Americans have helped to create multiple barriers for students to receive assistance for anxiety and depression, the two leading mental health illnesses in the United States. 237montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 19 OBJECTIVE 1Increase the number of African American male and Latinx students who graduate, transfer, and/or complete year over year.

OBJECTIVE 5Enhance collaborative efforts between credit and non-credit in and amongst academic and student affairs. Outcome: Create and ease educational pathways for WDCE learners. Indicator: Collected data demonstrating number and types of collaboration between Workforce Development and Continuing Education, cr edit programs, and student affairs. 23820MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS Subcommittee: Disability Inclusion Co-chairs: Sue Haddad, Christopher Moy Resource P erson: Rowena D'Souza Members: Ben Middle States Self-Study ReportMission: In acknowledgement of the opportunities identified in the 2018 Montgomery College Middle States Self-Study Report and Montgomery College's commitment to the full implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Disability Inclusion subcommittee will work toward the full inclusion of people with disabilities, creating a pathway toward inclusion and equity from a social justice perspective for persons with disabilities at Montgomery College. The recommended prioritized goals and strategies target five areas: Academic Access (A), Program and Electronic Information T echnology Access (P), Architectural Access (R), Employment Access (E), and Campus Climate for Persons with Disabilities (C).Vision: Lead in creating a welcoming, barrier free, inclusive learning and working environment for all members of MC, and one in which disability is recognized and valued as a distinct aspect of our diverse culture. In 2019, PACEI recommended the creation of the Disability Inclusion subcommittee to address specific suggestions made in the 2018 Montgomery College Middle States Self-Study Report. The report recognized and identified opportunities to model national best practices by the Association on Higher Education and Disability1 (AHEAD) in reframing disability from a medical model to a social justice model. \"This can be accomplished by expanding discussions of disability as a distinct aspect of diversity at the College and pr oviding increased educational programming on disability history and culture. There are opportunities to include disability in training related to culture and identity, education on bias and microaggressions, and focused programming during Disability Awareness Month.\" 2 The fundamental vision is to create a culture that inspires inclusion and considers access for persons living with disabilities in all decision-making throughout the College. Therefore, it is critical to integrate the social model of disability into the operating plan for the Office of Equity and Inclusion. 239montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 21 OBJECTIVE 1Create a culture that engages all administrators, faculty, staff, and students as leaders in the work of disability inclusion and accessibility.

Copyright \u00a9 1997 NC State University, The Center for Universal Design. https://projects.ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/about_ud/about_ud.htm Universal Design Principles - The seven principles of Universal Design were developed in 1997 by a working group of architects, product designers, engineers, and environmental design researchers, led by the late Ronald Mace at the North Carolina State University. The purpose of the principles is to guide the design of environments, products, and communications. According to the Center for Universal Design at NCSU, the principles \"may be applied to evaluate existing designs, guide the design process and educate both designers and consumers about the characteristics of more usable products and envir onments.\" The seven principles are: 1) equitable use, 2) flexible in use, 3) simple and intuitive use, 4) perceptible information, 5) tolerance for error, 6) low physical effort, and 7) size and space for approach and use. Nor th Carolina State University, The Center for Universal Design, https://projects. ncsu.edu/ncsu/design/cud/about_ud/udprinciplestext.htm Universal Design for Learning - Universal design for learning (UDL) is a framework to improve and optimize teaching and learning for all people based on scientific insights into how humans learn. The UDL framework is grounded in three principles: 1) multiple means of representation, 2) multiple means of engagement, and 3) multiple means of demonstration. (De veloped by Anne Meyer and David Rose, who first laid out the principles of UDL in the 1990's. www.cast.org) 24224MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS Subcommittee: Faculty, Teaching, and Curriculum Co-chairs: Linwood Ferguson, Mary Robinson, Emily Rosado (former chair) Resource Person: Andrea Foster Committee Members: Eric Benjamin, Akhtar Chowdhury, Angela Nissing Mission: The Faculty, Teaching, and Curriculum subcommitee strives to improve pedagogical and related practices carried out by faculty. It delivers instructional training advice, focused on meeting the learning needs of the College's diverse students. The subcommittee guides curricula enhancement to ensure that culture and thought differences are addressed. Vision: Recognize and grow the exemplary relationships between students and faculty established from their commitment to learning and teaching grounded in respecting/embracing differences in each other. The Faculty, Teaching, and Curriculum subcommittee endeavors to advance integrity within the student learning experience. The subcommittee is charged with developing proposals to improve instructional practices that enhance student equity in the classroom, along with academic and student support centers. Accordingly, the subcommittee pursues initiatives to augment the effectiveness of faculty and their contributions in achieving these principles. Informed by the recent Middle States accreditation process, PACEI infused its goals around the mission established at Montgomery College. The College's mission and the goals supporting it are driven by a commitment to social justice. According to Montgomery College President Dr. DeRionne Pollard: \"Most definitions of social justice relate to fairness. At MC, we are committed to creating str ategies that minimize the impact of continuing structural inequities on students' ability to afford college, their preparation for academics, and their success at proceeding to graduation or transfer.\"There are multiple factors affecting the performance of Black male and Latinx students, as well as that of students with disabilities. Focusing on the element of fairness, some of the factors that have influenced grading relate to race, disability, and gender. (Malouf and Thorsteinsson). It has been shown that the use of rubrics has r educed this bias (Gerritson). As an integral part of PACEI, the subcommittee endeavors to improve best practices carried out by faculty who meet students where they are. One such best practice relates to the development of rubrics that conform to discipline standards and standards to reduce instructor bias toward students. These standards would use qualitative or quantitative language appropriate to the discipline that is clear, not vague or open ended. The creation of a system that reduces this bias so that students are being graded on the content of their work rather than by some other factor is paramount. A more specific and clear (rather than open-ended) rubric is a highly effective method used t o ensure more consistency in grading. More consistency in grading means less room for bias because the standards will be less open to interpretation (Colburn, et. al). Conversely, less consistency in grading can mean more room for bias because the same instructor may interpret the same rubric differently depending on the student they are grading. Another important part of improving best practices is to insure rubrics exclude terminology based in a deficit model. A deficit model is one whose language or structure implies that the student will not improv e. One possible route is that point categories may be named according to scores (\"three points,\" \"two points,\" \"mediocre, \" \"novice \"). The next section highlights objectives for important pedagogical and administrativ e activities within MC's methodology for educating students. 243montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 25 OBJECTIVE 1Add a question to student course evaluations to reflect faculty's attention to diversity. The recommended new question is: \"Instructor acknowledges and respects student diversity. \" Outcome: Enhanced course evaluations such that students' assessments regarding faculty's attention to diversity are expressed. Indicators: The added question on the course evaluation results in 80% agree or strongly agree response rate from students. Students' course evaluations consistently include comments on instructors' inclusiv e teaching practices. OBJECTIVE 2Include a bullet point on faculty evaluation Form A for full-time faculty to reflect on their inclusive and equitable teaching practices. Outcome: Impr oved faculty self-evaluation procedure, which communicates information on equitable and inclusive teaching practices.Indicators: Language concerning teaching performance garners a positive response r ate from faculty. Faculty's self-e valuation descriptions consistently address their instruction practices, which cover equitable and inclusive methods to impart student learning. OBJECTIVE 3Include a line on the part-time faculty Classroom Observation Form: \"The instructor acknowledges and respects diversity .\" Outcome: Advanced classroom observation reviews that consider the instructor's acknowledgement and respect for diversity. Indicators: Description of actions to be observed suppor t the assessment of part-time faculty's incorporation of diversity in their instruction. The addition of diversity considerations into the classroom observation process influences improvement in part-time instructors' practices concerning student diff erences. OBJECTIVE 4Include a \"Strength in Diversity\" statement on the collegewide syllabus template. It would read as follows: \"Respect for Diversity: It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well served by this course; that students' learning needs be addr essed; and that sexuality, disability, age, socio- economic status, ethnicity, race, and culture are respected. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups. In addition, if any of our class meetings conflict with your religious events, please let me know so that we can make arrangements\" (adapted from the University of Iowa School of E ducation). Outcome: Redesigned syllabus template, which conveys respect for differences (e.g., race, gender, religion, etc.) as a teaching philosophy. Indicators: The addition of diversity considerations visible on the course syllabus will increase awar eness about diversity for students. The addition of diversity considerations visible on the course syllabus will demonstrate faculty 's commitment to design lessons that convey respect for differences (e.g., race, gender, religion, etc.) as a teaching philosophy. 24426MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS OBJECTIVE 5Ensure that rubrics conform to discipline standards and standards to reduce bias. These standards would include excluding terminology based in a deficit model and using qualitative or quantitative language appropriate to the discipline that is clear and specific, not vague or open ended. Outcomes: Formed an inter-disciplinary college wide discipline-wide committee on rubrics and implicit bias to cr eate model rubrics with annotations. Each academic year, offer a thr ee-part professional development workshops on reducing implicit bias through the use of rubrics, to be offered each academic year. These workshops can be divided into multiple sections for example Part I: Implicit Bias; Part II: Examples of Rubrics with Annotations; Part III: Effectively Using or Implementing Rubrics. Modeled rubrics with annotations available to faculty . Created and administered a student surv ey assessing fairness and clarity of rubrics. Indicators: By 2021, a collegewide committee on rubrics and implicit bias is formed. By 2022, administer a surve y regarding whether MC students find rubrics effective in reducing bias. By 2022, model rubrics with annotations created by the abov e committee are provided on the E-LITE hub or on Blackboard course hubs. By 2023, the College begins offering an annual professional de velopment workshop on using rubrics to mitigate implicit bias. By 2025, the professional dev elopment workshop is incorporated into required training for new full-time faculty. By 2026, readminister surve y regarding whether MC students find rubrics effective in reducing bias and assess results. 245montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 27 Subcommittee: Human Resources/Recruiting, Hiring, Retention, Succession Planning Chair: Karen Penn de Martinez Resource People: Elaine Doong, Lauren Landau, Krista Walker Committee Members: Nicolle Copeland, Sherry Randolph, Karla Silvestre Mission: The Human Resources/Recruiting, Hiring, Retention and Succession Planning subcommittee (HR) affirms that the ability to welcome, teach, and serve our div erse students must be a fundamental requirement for hiring and promotion at Montgomery College and a crucial qualification for all personnel. With a diverse student body, Montgomery College requires a diverse and culturally sensitive faculty and staff. Diversification of the MC workforce presents numerous oppor tunities for faculty, staff, and administrators to serve as role models, mentors, and advocates for equity and inclusion. Vision: To recruit, develop, and retain highly qualified faculty and staff who embrace MC's vision of multiculturalism, r adical inclusion, and racial equity, and who reflect the diversity of the student body and the Montgomery County population.The HR subcommittee affirms that diversity, equity, and inclusion in Montgomery College's workfor ce is more than a goal or aspiration: it is an essential component of academic and career success for the student body at the most diverse community college in the continental United States (Chronicle of Higher Education) . MC workforce diversity is also a key element of partnership, community engagement, and economic development for a Montgomery County population that is 56.7% non-white, 32% foreign-born, and 40.6% speakers of languages other than English (Data USA). We value the skills, knowledge, and cultural competency that diverse employ ees bring to our educational environment.Montgomery College has a student body that is approximately one-quarter each Black, Latinx, and White, and with substantial numbers of Asian, multi-racial, and international students. Employee groups that would benefit from greater representation, such as Hispanics/Latinx, should more closely reflect the diversity of our students. The Fall 2019 Enr ollment Summary indicates that Latinx individuals are 25.2% of students (Montgomery College OIRE, 2019) but only 6.5% of faculty and 3.9% of administrators (Montgomery College Office of Human Resources and Strategic Talent Management, 2020). Additionally, with 5.1% of MC students using Disability Support Services accommodations in 2018 (Haddad, 2019), increased inclusion and visibility of employees with disabilities would be of v alue. Recruiting efforts, professional development, and career advancement paths should position Montgomery College as a destination employer for diverse county residents, current MC students and alumni, traditionally underrepresented graduate interns, and equity-focused professionals. Thus, the College's Human Resources and Strategic Talent Management department should expand outreach activities and should incorporate guidance and assistance fr om current employees serving as \"diversity ambassadors\" to their own communities, external organizations, events, conf erences, and local graduate programs. Training on the value of diverse workforces and on avoiding unconscious bias should be developed and provided to all search committees and all hiring interviews should incorporate questions regarding the applicants' abilities to successfully work with and serve our diverse community. While Montgomery College has made noteworthy progress towards workforce div ersity, equity, and inclusion over the past five years, the recommendations of the subcommittee address some of the remaining work that is critically important for the next few y ears. 24628MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS OBJECTIVE 1Train administrators, hiring managers, and search committee chairs on the importance and benefits of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all phases of the hiring and promotion processes. Hold ourselves accountable for ensuring diverse pools of applicants, interviewees, and recommended candidates and be willing to reopen searches that fail to attract adequately diverse pools of candidates. Outcomes: By January 2021, the College will have implemented Sear ch Advocate training and appoint a coordinator of the Search Advocate training and administration process. Applicant and interview pools and hires will have reflected the diversity of the county population (the 2018 county population estimates are 19.9% Hispanic/Latino, 19.9% Black/African-American, 15.6% Asian, and races, according to www.census.gov/quickfacts/ montgomer ycountymaryland). Created a chart that describes reasons for failed sear ches. Indicators: Enhanced annual Personnel Profile showing demographic percentages of applicants, interviewees, and hires. Number of searches reopened or cancelled due to objectiv e not being met. OBJECTIVE 2Train and appoint equity-focused Search Advocates who will serve on search committees to help write inclusive position descriptions, job qualifications, and interview questions; raise awareness of unconscious bias; and promote the hiring of culturally competent employ ees. Outcome: Applicant and interview pools and hires will better reflect the diversity of the county population. Indicators: By July 2022, 50% of search committees will include a trained/certified search advocate who will work on the process from cr eating the position description through the hiring/onboarding phase. By July 2025, 75% of searches will include a trained/certified search advocate. OBJECTIVE 3T rain, fund, and appoint current employees to serve as Diversity Recruitment Ambassadors to conduct outreach support and promote MC as a destination employer to underrepresented groups in the community, graduate schools, minority professional associations, and conferences. At the end of the pilot period, the CEIO and HRSTM, will evaluate the impact of the diversity recruitment ambassadors on MC's visibility in the community, applicant pools, and hiring. The CEIO in collaboration with HRSTM will issue a written report to SALT including the findings and recommendations to continue, modify, or discontinue the Diversity Recruitment Ambassador program. Outcome: Two diversity recruitment ambassadors will be funded for a one-y ear pilot program in AY 21/22 and will conduct outreach, dedicating 100-120 hours per semester each. This should include 5-8 events or outreach activities, as well as the necessary preparation and communication time. Indicators: Number of Diversity Recruitment Ambassadors funded and appointed. Enhanced annual Personnel Profile showing demographic percentages of applicants, interviewees, and hires. 247montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 29 OBJECTIVE 4Updated and utilized the Minority Faculty Internship policy (P&P #32201) to allow departments to provide temporary teaching positions to less experienced prospects or current graduate students from traditionally underrepresented minority groups or those with disabilities. Outcome: Multiple departments will have cr eated temporary positions for minority faculty interns, allowing these individuals to become familiar with College practices and to become more competitive candidates for permanent positions, while exposing MC students to instructors and mentors of color or with disabilities.. Indicators: Increased number of minority faculty intern positions created and filled. Number of minority faculty interns who were converted t o MC employees. 24830MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS Subcommittee: Nationwide Peer Institution Best Practices/Assessment and Evaluation/Resources Chair: Maria Davidson, Brad Pabian (former chair) Resource Person: Bo ChanCommittee Members: Diana Benson, Frances Nolen, Julie Weber, Laura White Mission: Montgomery College is strong in its commitment to equity and inclusion best practices, which inform us to create a common framework for our service that is innovative, data-driven, replicable, and impactful.Vision: Committed to using data to support equity and growth for both the student and employee experience. The Nationwide Peer Institution Best Practices/Assessment and Evaluation/Resources subcommittee has engaged in analyzing and assessing Montgomery College's employee Equity and Inclusion (E&I) Survey results, and then conducting research on E&I best practices at community college peer institutions. We identified and reviewed more than 50 institutions' approaches to E&I services and pr actices, including site visits and virtual visits to Frederick Community College, Pierce Community College, Portland Community College, Oregon State University, Northern Virginia Community College, Howard Community College, the University of Maryland at College Park, the Community College of Baltimore County, and the University of Southern California's Race & Equity Center. We created a common framework for our research that qualified as an \"E&I best practice,\" any IDEEALS service or practice that is innovativ e, data-driven, replicable, and impactful. While MC is strong in its commitment to E&I practices, as cited in the College's values statement, this subcommittee also noted specific areas for growth for both students and employees. Employee surv ey results showed discrepancies in what the College's E&I culture is and what it should be. These findings influenced not only our subcommittee's recommendations, but also the Roadmap for Success as a whole. Common employee- r elated themes included: enhance the MC culture, climate, and community; diversity programming and policies; recruitment and hiring practices; and promote and retain diverse employee groups. In addition, while MC is strong in its commitment to student success, we also found gaps in explicitly stating E&I practices. Although the \"Equity\" functional area scoring in the Institutional Capacity Assessment Tool (ICAT) would lead us t o believe the College is at a strong level of capacity with regard to equity practices, our research and E&I survey results show we still have strides to make. 249montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 31 OBJECTIVE 1Assess and measure student experience and sense of belonging at the College. Outcome: Selection of a tool, determine sample population, and achieve 40% response rate. Indicator: Administered a Student Climate and Culture Survey to establish baseline data and schedule ongoing assessment to share with College stakeholders. (www.montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/ euity-and-inclusion/index.html). OBJECTIVE 2Foster empowerment and a sense of belonging among specific diverse populations at the College. Outcome: Developed an employee resource framework to establish affinity groups and determine each affinity group' s purpose, goals, and objectives. Indicators: Ten-percent impro ved employee engagement survey responses biannually. Number of affinity groups established. OBJECTIVE 3Ensure a data-driv en accountability measurement system of all E&I goals and objectives. Outcome: Designated OIRE staff for E&I needs to create dimension-mapping analytic tool to track PACEI recommendations and monitor progress on recommendations. Indicator: Subcommittees finalize the measurements for each goal and objective, identify the communication tool, and develop the schedule of r eporting. OBJECTIVE 4Finalize and roll out a one pager on the student complaint process to enhance student awareness of the complaint process. Outcome: Created a communication strategy for student roadmap for resolving complaints, and develop an assessment questionnaire. Indicator: Increased student usage of appropriate process as evidenced by questionnaire. OBJECTIVE 5Improve Montgomery College leadership's knowledge, skills, and awareness of racial and cultural issues.Outcome: MC leadership, including SAL T, PEC members, and other managers will continue and complete comprehensive training in race equity, courageous conversations, and white fragility, etc. taught by nationally recognized facilitators/speakers. Indicators: Each leadership member shall complete a minimum of one relevant workshop/activity listed and facilitate discussions with their teams. Improved ratings on identified questions on employee E&I surve y. 25032MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS Subcommittee: Reports and Communications Co-chairs: Mohibullah Durrani, James Sniezek Resource Bailey, Christine Tracey, Farah Vivas Mission: Montgomery College is committed to equity and inclusion by leveraging our technology, multimedia, and human resources to bridge the communication gap between the College, its employees, its students, and the global community. Vision: With developed relationships, we strive to strengthen and affirm our contribution and participation in keeping the College and the global community informed and alleviating communication barriers. Similar to other PA CEI subcommittees, the Reports and Communications subcommittee commenced its work by analyzing and assessing Montgomery College's employee Equity and Inclusion (E&I) Survey results and then conducting research on E&I best practices at community college peer institutions. Several key themes became apparent. These include: 1. The general belief that opportunities for prof essional and personal development are not being communicated. Betterment of this practice could improve employee retention. 2. Although a good percentage of MC employees ar e non- English or limited-English speakers, most key documents are in English only and presentations (e.g., celebrations, professional development workshops, opening meetings) are often given in English only. They are also translated in real time by ASL interpreters when requested. Communication in languages other than English would bring additional inclusion to the MC community. 3. The perception that discrimination and verbal/mental/physical abuse goes largely unr eported at MC owing to lack of recognition that there are reporting methods other than \"English-only\" reporting methods must be addressed. Efforts to communicate pr ocedures for reporting instances of abuse need to be improved. 4. The perceived loss of trust within the MC community must be regained t o optimally forward our mission. Increased efforts and improved methods of communication will signal the rebuilding of a lasting trust. A communication plan where inclusivity is apparent via multiple, woven communication strategies will provide the fabric that binds the MC community. To work towards resolving the identified weaknesses listed above, the Reports and Communications subcommittee first crafted three goals. Implementation of these goals has already begun with the translation into Spanish of the document Benefits and Opportunities for MC Employees and the availability of the College landing (home) page in seven primary languages. The publication of the President's Advisory Committee on Equity and Inclusion (PACEI) Newsletter also signals a commitment to the dissemination and subsequent discussion of subjects that need attention. Topics such as Culturally Responsive Teaching and Learning; The Importance of Understanding Unconscious Bias; Creating Inclusive Environments; and Civility Norms were boldly printed to inform and educate our employees. PACEI has learned through extensive Pizza for Your Thoughts sessions with students that many students/prospective students would be more comfortable with their contemporaries translating from English to the language they need to interact in student service areas and outreach/community events. The subcommittee also observed that certain courses at MC are skills-based, as are most laboratory courses. As such, the subcommittee also worked with the Office of Institutional Research and Effectiv eness to analyze Drop Fail Withdraw (DFW) rate data from FY 2014-FY 2018 through the lens of communications and potential language barriers. Data looked at percentages by gender/r ace/ethnicity and by number of credits attained. Broad analysis of these data show: 1. Men tend to have higher DFW rates. 2. Students with more credits earned have lower DFW rates. 3. Multi-race and Black students have higher DFW rates (men and women). 4. Asian men and women tend to have the lowest DFW rates. Over all, DFW rates have declined for all subgroups over the FY14 to FY18 time period. Many college employees ar e now aware of these trends, and many others do not see how getting to the causative factors that perpetuate these differences becomes our collective equity challenge. One of the causative factors could be language/comprehension barriers. In addition to studying these DFW rates, the subcommittee observed that certain courses at MC ar e skills-based, as are most laborator y courses. Many of the first courses that count toward a progr am requirement are heavy on foundation concepts (theory-rich) in that area (e.g., BIOL 150, CHEM 131, and MATH 181 fit this description). Professors spend much time discussing foundation topics, and the textbooks are generally complex and v ery detailed. The lecture and text in these courses are difficult for all students but some students, for which English may not be their primary language, may experience gr eater struggle with comprehension. Note: Additional resources (personnel and financial) are required for accomplishing these objectives. 251montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 33 OBJECTIVE 1Publish fall and spring PACEI newsletter and an Office of Equity and Inclusion Annual Report utilizing the translation services already contr acted with the College in a minimum of two languages and in accessible formats. Outcome: The newsletter is published each semester and the Annual Report is published simultaneously in the languages selected and in an accessible format. Indicator: The newsletter and report will initially be in two languages, English and Spanish. Additional languages can be added later depending on the requirements of students, staff, and the community. OBJECTIVE 2Finalize and formally publish the draft version of the Brochure for Benefits offered to MC employees in a minimum of two languages. Outcome: A benefits brochure will be available to the staff and faculty of MC. The draft benefits brochure (on the OneDrive) may need additional benefits to be listed that are available, and a final version has to be seen by the HRSTM benefits personnel. Indicator: Once HRSTM has approv ed the brochure, it will be printed and distributed, as well as uploaded to the MC website. OBJECTIVE 3Add an E&I update to monthly \"Communications\" reports, and translate it and other key College documents, such as: President's Message Inside MC Online Policy and Procedure (P&P) MC events open to the community for gr aduation Outcome: Other key documents will initially be available in English and Spanish languages. Additional languages can be added later depending on requirements of students, staff, and the community. Indicator: The identified key documents will be available in print for distribution, as well as uploaded to the MC website. OBJECTIVE 4Dev elop partnerships with CASA of Maryland and create Translation Student Diversity Ambassadors to offer students opportunities to provide interpretation services at all College community events, such as orientation, honor ceremonies, graduation, and Presidential Dialogues. Outcome: Translation/interpretation from English to Spanish will be possible by student ambassadors to help students navigate registration, etc. The student ambassadors will also offer verbal translation/interpretation services during orientation, honor ceremonies, graduation, and Presidential Dialogues. Additional languages can be added later depending on requirements of students, staff, and the community. Indicator: Translation/interpretation services will be expanded for the above-mentioned services. OBJECTIVE 5Expand MCTV coverage to include broadcasting more shows and global College offerings in languages other than English and some Spanish. Outcomes: MCTV pro vides additional broadcast offerings in languages other than English. Monitor effectiveness of pr ogramming. Indicator: Increase in number of programs delivered in other languages. 25234MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS OBJECTIVE 6Investigate the possibility of offering theory-rich courses in alternate languages for areas with high DFW's, for example, math, science, humanities, and behavioral social sciences. Identify these courses through a vailable College data sources. Outcomes: Using student success data measures to identify suitable theory rich courses, offer at least one section of each course in an alternative language by the fall 2021 semester. Indicators: Offer a minimum of one section of identified courses in an alternative language by fall 2021. Gauge effectiveness of such offerings in decreasing DFW rates through student surve ys. 253montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 35 Subcommittee: Training, Dialogue, Events, and Celebrations Chair: Ramon De La Cruz Resource Person: climate, and community through education, awar eness-building, and community engagement (e.g., by breaking down implicit and explicit bias).Vision: Realize equity and inclusion at the College through trainings, dialogue forums, events, and celebrations. The Training, Dialogue, Events, and Celebrations subcommittee seeks to create a safe and inclusive college community by deepening and enhancing the level of discussion and training around diversity and inclusion issues; expanding cultural program offerings that reflect our values; creating a space for differing viewpoints regarding political ideology; and celebr ating the diversity of the college community and the richness that our diverse identities bring to education. This committee's recommendations were informed by the results of the Equity and Inclusion Survey, the Climate Survey, and the Employment Engagement Survey, among others. Our goal is to change the culture at MC in such a way that outcomes of future surveys reflect greater engagement, stronger morale, and increased inclusion among the MC community at large. 25436MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS OBJECTIVE 1Increase training around the topics of ethics, equity, and inclusion, using surveys from annual Equity Dialogues, the Equity Summit, and Equity and Inclusion/Ethics/Employee Engagement surveys to determine topics to implement. Outcome: Greater employee and student engagement in equity and compliance events and sessions.Indicators: Decreased visits to Employee and Labor Relations Office and decreased Ethics Office complaints. The responses to surve y questions about \"the Equity Dialogues and Equity Summit helping to foster stronger college and institutional relationships\" leads to 70% saying \"Agree employees through incentives.Outcome: Part-time faculty will be more engaged with the college communityIndicators: Funds are budgeted annually, allocated t o provide stipends for part-time faculty to attend training. Up to 150 part-time faculty attended rele vant training on culturally-relevant and racial equity pedagogy each year. OBJECTIVE 3Increase equity at the College by being transparent about hiring practices (when a job is open, when applications are no longer being accepted, when it has been closed). Ensure the interview practice is transparent. Outcomes: Increased the number of employees at all le vels of the College who are people of color, have disabilities, or identify as LGBTQ by: 1) Posting jobs on different job boards and keeping application windows open longer. 2) Creating a diversity internship for both faculty and staff to include race, disability, and LGBTQ as defining of diversity. 3) Surve ying staff to increase self-identification for disability, LGBT Q, etc. 4) Responding to internal candidates about the status of their application and notification that they were unsuccessful within 60 days. Held workshops for Montgomery College employees seeking upward mobility on enhancing resumes, interview skills, and transfer able job skills. Workshop will emphasize that internal candidates are judged by interview answers and requested application materials. Indicat ors: HR provides monthly KPI report and sends to Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer detailing outcomes #1 and #4. Annual budget will be allocated per year to host one Diversity Intern with the internship r otating between different departments based on highest need. Update current MC Policy and Procedur e on the Minority Internship Program to include internal candidates. Surveys show an incr ease year-to-year for those who identify as having a disability, etc. Interview Rubrics and Questions are posted on Montgomery College 's Job Board for applicants to be better prepared. Two career and resume workshops ar e held bi-annually, including one for faculty and one for staff. OBJECTIVE 4Build a culture of respect and inclusivity through restorative justice.* Outcome: Created a process for addressing instances of discrimination that follows a restorative-justice- based resolution framework. Indicator: The offices of Ombuds and Employee and Labor Relations reports the increased number of times a restor ative justice model was used in the resolution. 255montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 37 OBJECTIVE 5Provide training for student success: improve persistence, retention, and graduation/transfer of all students, especially those of African-American male and Latinx students through developing an academy for Latinx and Black male students for tutoring, mentoring, etc., and creating/supporting multicultural inclusion center spaces to serve as hubs for training, dialogue, events, and celebrations on each campus. Outcomes: Increase in graduation/transf er/persistence rate for African-American male and Latinx students is increased by 2% annually. Number of students reporting increased sense of belonging on student climate survey. By 2025, there is a \"multicultural/inclusion \" space (office/center) on each campus. Indicators: Increased graduation/transf er/persistence rate for African American male and Latinx students. Multicultural centers created on each campus (www.montgomer ycollege.edu/about-mc/equity- andinclusion/index.html). Increased the number of Black and Latinx faculty. \"Restorative justice is a collaborative process involving those most directly affected by an offense, called the 'primary stakeholders,' in determining how best to repair the harm caused by the off ense\" 1Justice requires the healing of the harm as much as possible. The restor ative approach has high control and high support and the essence of restorativ e justice is collaborative problem-solving. Restorative practices provide an opportunity for those who have been most affected by an incident to come together to share their feelings, describe how they were affected and develop a plan to repair the harm done or prev ent a reoccurrence. The restor ative approach is reintegrativ e, allowing the \"bad\" actor to make amends and shed the bad actor label. www.iirp.edu/pdf/paradigm.pdf 25638MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS Subcommittee: Workforce Development and Community Engagement/Business Practices and Procurement Co-chairs: Shakenna Adams-Gormley, David Torain Resource People: Ken Nelson, Patrick Members: Shayla Atkins, Steve Greenfield, Sharon Kauffman, Eniola Olowofoyeku, Donna Pina Mission: The Workforce Development and Community Engagement/Business Practices and Procurement subcommittee acknowledges the impor tance of diversity and inclusion in our faculty, staff, student, community, and business populations.

PACEI GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS B Y AREA A. Cultural Competency Recommendations. Building Community and Culture. T o build an academic community that is diverse, equitable, and inclusive, we will support expansion of our institutional infrastructure, including PACEI and diversity ambassadors. We also will continue to develop impactful, compelling programming that reflects a diversity of perspectives. Our programming also amplifies and intensifies our commitment to the community through an expansion of workforce development pr ogramming, virtual/ remote work and learning, and online and in-person classes provided by our community engagement centers, including GED, technology, and childcare classes. In both word and deed, our College community must uphold a commitment to the equality of all persons, inclusive of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and life experience. We will seek to create and foster a climate in which we understand and learn from each other and realize the extraordinar y benefits of a broad range of perspectives. Our goal is to enhance our collectiv e capacity, not merely to tolerate discussion of sensitive issues, but to foster free and open debate in and outside of our classrooms and lecture halls. As a College, our paramount focus on education requires us to constantly consider how to teach our students about the world and give them the tools to understand and navigate it\u2014whether assessing complex principles of physics or the complicated history of race in our society. PACEI will continue to make annual recommendations regarding instructional options for cultural competency and how best to prepare students to understand and navigate an increasingly complex and multicultural world. In order to foster a community that is diverse and inclusive while maintaining the promise of free and open debate, we will create additional opportunities for students, faculty, and staff to develop cultural awareness. We will work to address complaints and incidents in a consistent and supportive manner. B. Student Success and Retention. Over the past sever al years, Montgomery College has worked intensively to increase the graduation and retention rates for all students and to close the gap in graduation rates between black and brown students and the broader student body. Six-year degree completion rates for black and brown students have increased over the past couple of years with the emphasis in tracking the 4,033 new students who entered the College in fall 2018. PACEI will continue to learn best practices from the Achieving the Dream Network and work with the Student Success Network to make recommendations that foster and create equitable and inclusive outcomes. The College has developed programs that intervene early to provide appropriate supports for our students, including the Peer2Peer program. As a result of an extensive student campaign where students designed a model which allows them to be of support to their student peers, The Peer2Peer program was developed in response to 41000 Student Success policy, section IV. Student Commitment, A.B. that states students will be champions of their own learning and champions of their peers' learning. Peers includes Peer Advocates, Peer Educators Peer Mentors, and Peer Navigators. Peer Advocates facilitate weekly Peer Suppor t Groups on campus, focusing on a variety of social and academic topics to help educate their peers on strategies for success. Peer Educators educate on v arious compliance and prevention topics, including safety, awareness, and education through workshops, social media campaigns, and discussions. Peer Mentors pro vide a reliable relationship to their peers to help navigate through MC. Peer Navigators pr ovide guidance, information, and support for students, newcomers, and visitors relative to MC resources, while showing their Raptor pride. PACEI recommends strengthening and augmenting student achievement programs such as Advocacy for Latino Students (ALAS) and the Boys To Men programs. Boys To Men fosters long-term academic success in African American and Black male students and is dedicated to the retention of African American/Black males at Montgomery College through student activism and personal accountability. BTM provides academic, career, and personal mentoring. Members also benefit from having their academic progress 259montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 41 monitored each semester, and individual sessions with mentors make sure the members are meeting their personal goals. BTM hosts off-campus gatherings and activities, as well as a book reading and discussion series. ALAS seeks to empower Hispanic/Latinx students with enhanced student support services, sponsorship, fundraising, networking, and de velopment opportunities. Its intended outcomes include: Increased recruitment, retention, suppor t, and matriculation of Latinx students. Equitable student representation in faculty and leadership t o improve the student experience. Partner with PA CEI to promote services and equity and inclusion work at MC. Community fostered among MC Native American, Hispanic/Latinx, African American, and international students and employees, influencing participation in Heritage Month events and Tapestry, enhancing mentor services. C. Broadening Multicultural Affairs. P ACEI is recommending that the College take steps to increase collaboration and coordination of multicultural affairs efforts, LGBTQ efforts, gender equity efforts, and student life organizations in order to more effectively support the many facets of diversity, intersecting identities, and community. We recommend these areas develop new pr ogramming to support and educate students, such as meet-ups for LGBTQ students of color and dialogues on the intersections of sexual orientation, gender identity, and other dimensions of self. We also recommend instituting a Student Advisory Board for multicultural affairs in fall 2022. Serving on the advisor y board, students will play an integral role in the evolution of this work (montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion/index.html).D. LGBTQ Needs Assessment. In spring 2021, the Office of Equity and Inclusion will launch an assessment of LGBT Q affairs to identify opportunities for growth and support in this area. E. Pathways for Employ ees. Achieving excellence in Montgomery College's mission depends on the contributions of employees at all levels throughout the College. Outstanding staff critically support the efforts of our staff, faculty, and students, and we cannot achieve the fully diverse and inclusive environment we aspire to unless we deeply embed those values in the selection, retention, training, support, and advancement of our employees, from our faculty to our building maintenance employees. Our goals in this area are to create clear pathways to employment for diverse, talented individuals; to build programs that support their growth and development; and to provide compensation and benefits that allow our staff\u2014 at all levels of the or ganization\u2014to thrive. Since fall 2010, underrepresented minorities among faculty and staff have increased. This increase in diversity is not yet consistent across all departments, but it is reflected at all levels. During the same period, the administrator le vel also increased. The College is increasingly intentional in our efforts to build new and different talent pipelines throughout the organization, with a particular focus at present on entry-lev el hiring and development of faculty. We recommend working closely with outreach partners t o expand the College's participation in programs that help draw entry-level talent and are exploring new opportunities for hiring through extensive community outreach. F. Hiring Diverse Faculty. PACEI has identified recruitment, hiring, and retention of a diverse faculty as one of our greatest challenges and among the effor ts that will have the greatest, long-term impact on our students. Progress in this area will require a concerted effort across every division of the College. Search advocates, diversity ambassadors, and the Faculty Diversity Program will serve as the cornerstone of our efforts, supplemented by efforts in strategic hiring and faculty mentoring. 26042MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS G. Hiring Diverse Staff. Recent increases in the percentage of underrepresented minorities working at Montgomery College are reflected at all levels of employment but are not yet consistent across all departments. We will work to address the challenges of opening new pathways to jobs at Montgomery College and creating more opportunities for career development, mentoring, and advancement. We will also embed search advocates in staff hiring. H. Professional De velopment. The College also endeavors to build better professional development programs for staff seeking to advance their careers at Montgomery College. We are recommending expanding and developing cohort- based mentorship pr ograms, and, in response to feedback received through both the Equity and Inclusion and Employee Engagement surveys, we are simplifying the College's performance review process to facilitate honest dialogue between supervisors and staff about performance strengths and areas of opportunity. Building on the Employee Engagement Survey results, HRSTM has rolled out a streamlined performance feedback program in 2020 and bey ond into the next academic year starting with 360 feedback surveys in spring 2020. The goal is to ensure that supervisors and their staff across the College are having two direct conversations per year regarding areas of performance strength and professional development opportunities. All of these efforts to improve the recruitment, development, and retention of a strong staff depend on support and advice from employee groups, such as the governance councils and PACEI. PACEI has urged leadership to improve hiring and promotion practices to support increased diversity across the College. The College will continue working to advance these objectives in entry-level hiring, career development mentorships, and employee benefits reform. In some cases, we are able to build on existing pr ograms; in others, we are strongly committed to changing old programs or constructing new ones. We also recognize that these represent only a f ew pieces of the total program for a distinctive professional development experience for all College staff. Among our next recommended steps: Increase entry-lev el hiring. Begin an internal Diversity Mentor Progr am. I. Providing Equitable and Inclusiv e Experiences for Employees. Montgomery College values its employees, and we recognize the health and safety needs that require additional supports in order to be equitable. One example of this would be ensuring continuity of operations plans that are thoughtful, well communicated, inclusive, and responsive to unexpected situations or emergencies. Operations planning helps the College prepare to maintain mission critical operations and needs to be updated and reviewed annually. J. The Employee and Labor Relations Team (ELR) within HRSTM has the primary responsibility for investigating complaints and enforcing corrective action for the College 's EEO, anti-discrimination, and anti-bullying policies, among others. ELR can assist both employees and supervisors with a variety tools to navigate difficult workplace issues and concerns. ELR also works closely with each of the College's three unions on collectiv e bargaining issues. Additionally, the ELR team delivers training on a variety of HR compliance issues and best practices. ELR expects to contribute to IDEEALS thr ough the following indicators: Number of complaints will increase through 2023 due t o increased comfort of reporting. Number of cases maintained a time-to-close rate at an efficient level, around 60 days. Number of discrimination and bullying complaints will have decreased b y 2025. 261montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 43 TABLE 1. DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS AT MONTGOMER Y COLLEGE Note: Two sets of data to draw from include: actual number and percentages. When examining the demographic distribution at Montgomery College through the equity lens, percentages show current status of minority and underrepresented populations clearly. DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPINSTITUTION PERSONNEL* (FALL 2019)STUDENT Employee information is based on 2019 fall profile. ** Student Enrollment information is based on Montgomery County Office of Legislative Oversight report data. As defined by the Montgomery County Office of Legislative Oversight: the categorizations \"by race\" include students who are also categorized as \"foreign.\" The categorization reflects the true race of the students, rather than the citizenship. *** County information source: latest U.S. Census Sur vey Census (Population estimates, July 1, 2019) https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/montgomerycountymaryland/PST045219#PST045219 26244MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS X. Equity Plans In 2000, Montgomery College created the Office of Equity and Diversity, now called the Office of Equity and Inclusion. Today the office is continuing to build the IDEEALS framework of racial equality throughout MC's campuses and tr aining locations. Montgomery College's focus on racial equity has led to the development of an annual Student Success Score Card, which tracks student academic outcomes, separated by race and gender. MC also has launched programs specifically focused on the success of students from underrepresented minority gr oups, including the initiatives described in this section. Over the next five years, we will work to implement the PACEI recommendations thr oughout this document and seek to amplify, integrate, and measure those recommendations. In 2017, the College hired its first chief equity and inclusion officer. In the spring of 2019, the Office of Equity and Inclusion created the Student Success Network to ensure institutional policies, pr ocesses, and procedures support student success and completion for all students. In July 2019, the College hired its first chief analytics and effectiveness officer to analyze student data to identify barriers and to turn that data into actionable insights. Our intention is for each division unit at the College t o develop equity plans, beginning in 2022. For example, a student equity plan may expand existing programs in a way that broadens and strengthens their impact in terms of the number of students reached, their retention and degree completion, and their sense of belonging within the Montgomery College community. As such, our chief equity and inclusion officer will work with other college leaders, faculty, and staff to incorporate these initiativ es into the ongoing work of the College. Training to develop unit equity plans will be rolled out in academic year 2020-2021. These plans may will be embedded through updates to existing plans including AMP , StAMP , etc. Updates developed in academic year 2021-2022 will begin implementation by 2022. Divisional Equity Efforts. Each of our divisions has undertaken significant efforts to advance the conversations around equity and inclusion. As an educational institution, we play an important role in helping our community understand how t o build bridges at challenging moments, broaden perspectives through interaction, and uphold a fundamental optimism in individuals' capacity to grow. We want ever y member of the Montgomery College community to know of the importance we place on div ersity and inclusion, and to be given personal and professional opportunities for growth and development through evidence-based training. Our challenge is to develop a shared understanding of the kinds of comments that are and are not conducive to the College environment we seek\u2014whether in person, in public, or in social media forums. We will adhere to our Principles for Academic Fr eedom and address forthrightly remarks or actions that cross into discrimination, harassment, or other forms of prohibited conduct. Economic Inclusion. In the Montgomery College 2020-2025 Strategic Plan, we launched a major expansion of our economic inclusion program by making policy changes to increase our local hiring, purchasing, and contracting and to create more opportunities for Montgomery County's small, local, minority, and women-owned businesses. Student Success Network. The Student Success Network (SSN), based on a framework from Achieving the Dream, was created to establish the conditions necessary for the transition to college, academic success, and full engagement in campus life. PACEI recommends the SSN adopt equity plans and amplify its work to the broader college community. Our students help to shape and define the academic, cultural, and social vibrancy of our campuses. We believe that diversity\u2014of experience, perspective, and back ground\u2014 is essential to the strength and excellence of our community. We expect to recruit, retain, and support our students and ensure that the intellectual and social environment at Montgomery College allows them to flourish and transfer , graduate, or fulfill their plans. We must remain attentive to the needs of our diverse student body acr oss all identities, affiliations, and backgrounds that are underserved in higher education and unpack the student data, regularly report the pr ogress in this space, and make adjustments to the delivery of services as needed. 263montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 45 Academic Affairs. The College's academic leadership is committed to exploring options and strategies for expanding our educational offering in the realm of cultural diversity. Such options include both credit and non-credit initiatives focusing on faculty engagement, student engagement, program enhancements, and professional development. Faculty Engagement Faculty are engaged in a variety of activities that contribute to increased awareness of diversity and greater understanding of inclusiveness. Many have participated in fellowships, presented at conferences (both domestic and international), participated in panel discussions, authored books and peer reviewed articles, as well as facilitated guest speakers into their classroom and to the college community to speak on topics relating to equity and inclusiveness. Faculty have also engaged in ex change programs, as well as taught at overseas universities and developed courses in foreign languages. PACEI supports continued integration into the Classroom-Program and Discipline-related Initiatives where: Several disciplines ha ve included cultural competencies within their curriculum as part of their course outcomes. There are sev eral courses that have multi-cultural designations and focus on diversity issues such as ethnicity, race, religion, and sexual diversity (e.g., HIST211 History of Latinos in the U.S., POLI 252 Race and Ethnicity in U.S. Politics). Programs such as nursing hav e included competencies in their curriculum relating to diversity and teaching students how cultural factors can influence nursing care, and how to respect the healthcare beliefs and pr actices of a diverse patient population. Faculty work in these areas hav e resulted in the development of a wide range of classroom activities to engage, increase understanding, and educate students on embracing inclusiveness. Students have participated in study abr oad programs. Participated in field trips with students at museums such as the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Students in KORA 102 have engaged in e-pal corr espondence with undergraduate students in Korea. The American Sign language discipline joined the ASL Honor Society. Viewing and discussion of documentaries relating to race, ethnicity , and gender. Several noncredit programs focus on serving the diverse community. These programs focus on their immediate learning and career aspirations, or enabled connection to degree programs to continue their studies. Programs include Adult ESL and GED, the Hispanic Business Training Institute, the Refugee Training Progr am serving newly arriving immigrants through language skill development, acculturation of community norms, career development, and other skills. Professional Development: The Office of E-Learning, Innovation and Teaching Excellence (ELI TE) is dedicated to promoting diversity programs for both faculty and staff. In addition to creating and developing its own diversity programs, ELITE partners with other units and departments to form rich collaborations in diversity awareness for staff and faculty. Some of these programs include: Creating an Inclusive Classroom, creating radically inclusive course materials with Universal Design and Going Global, and Growing Global: Fostering international education and exchange at community colleges. (Taken from Academic Affairs responses report.) Student Affairs. Montgomery College students regularly provided service hours to our neighbors in Montgomery County through our Service-Learning Program. Our student life service coordinators work with leaders from community-based organizations to create opportunities for volunteers. SHaW. The Student Health and Wellness Center for Success (SHaW) Center, focuses on Mental Health Wellness, Health, Human Services and Nutrition, Health and Safety Education and Physical Wellness. The goal is to identify, pro vide and connect students to resources that support success. Some common challenges students face are food and housing security, access to health care and mental health support, among others. Montgomery College's network of community resources that includes internal and external partnerships and relationships, help remove those obstacles to support their academic success. Nourishing the mind, body and spirit to support students mental and physical well-being, the SHaW Centers offers the following resources t o support and strengthen equity and inclusion: -Diversity and Inclusion Online Course. As part of the Compliance and Pr evention Educational Suite catalog, a Diversity and Inclusion online course is available. This is a 40-minute online course designed to equip students with information and skills to foster a culture of inclusion excellence. -Identity-Related Trauma Workshops. Through the Mind-Body Medicine Skills Program: One-hour workshops to support identity-related trauma. The SHaW Center for Success' advanced trainers of the Center for Mind-Body Medicine use imagery , drawings, concentrative, and expressive meditation, and other skills' exercises to support students, faculty, and staff who have experienced trauma. 26446MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS Raptor Central. In order to create a common student experience as outlined in the StAMP and to foster more equitable pr actices for students to navigate, the Response Center (phone center) and the three campus Welcome Centers merged together to cr eate a new department called Raptor Central. Specifically, Raptor Central will maintain an in-person presence and a phone presence, but operate as one lar ger service, creating a common student experience and streamlining the enrollment process. As one department, services that were once only available either via phone or in person will now be available at all locations. At the same time, the Office of Enrollment Services became the \"Office of Records and Registration,\" a name that is more identifiable to students and is adopted in the higher education community. Ultimately, Raptor Centr al will become the doorway to the College, and Records and Registration will function as a more process-oriented office. Looking at each service side by side, the new Raptor Centr al will continue to be responsible for the following: 1) providing general information to all students (prospective, returning, and current), 2) helping students with enrollment and intake of financial aid forms and questions, 3) providing troubleshooting with the web, 4) providing group tours, and 5) helping review and remove holds and update credit hours as needed. In addition to these aforementioned functions, Raptor Central will now support the following: 6) processing admissions applications (online and in-person), 7) fulfilling official transcript requests, 8) accepting and entering test scores int o Banner, 9) accepting Permission to Enroll Forms, 10) completing Enrollment Verification Forms, and 11) collecting forms for academic appeals, tuition waiver, and graduation. As for Recor ds and Registration, the focus will center on supporting current students who have inquiries that may impact their record or require approval from the registrar. Some of these processes may include registering special student populations or cohorts, processing appeals (e.g., tuition, residency, or academic in nature), graduation certification, transcript evaluation, veterans certification, complex enrollment verification, major changes, information changes, and academic standing. Faculty-based functions such as course scheduling, health science applications, course cancellations, course substitutions, On-Time Registration, and grade changes will remain in this office. Student Orientation. Starting in 2021, PACEI r ecommends that all new students attend a large lecture either in person or online on diversity and inclusion followed by small-group meetings for facilitated discussions of these core values and how to apply them on and off campus. At that time, OEI will collaborate with Safe Zones to revamp Safe Zone training and pilot a workshop through which first-year students participate in hour-long discussions led by Peer2P eer program students on topics such as the impact of identity and heritage on communication and social interactions. Student Participation and L eadership. Stewardship of our campus climate is a shared responsibility. Students play a central role in shaping the environment and academic experience and should be actively engaged in wrestling with the difficulties of combating harmful bias while protecting free expression. As a par t of our efforts to strengthen the climate at Montgomery College, the College hopes to find new ways to empower and call upon our students\u2014and others\u2014t o participate and play leadership roles. Cultural Competency Workshops for Incoming Students. Based on student f eedback regarding cultural competency, the College will provide cultural competency workshops to incoming fall 2021 students. These workshops will be designed to deepen understandings; forge relationships across racial, ethnic, religious, and other lines; and increase the capacity of our community to engage with challenging issues in an open and constructive manner. Training. Enhanced cultur al competency trainings. Based on the feedback from diverse student, faculty, and staff groups from across the College, it is clear that we need to offer\u2014and in some cases require\u2014additional training in diversity, inclusion, and cultural awareness. We thus recommend the continuation of the Professional De velopment Workgr oup to undertake two key tasks: 1) To seek out and ev aluate the most effective and impactful trainings available across higher education and beyond, and 2) to make recommendations for a suite of cultural competency and racial equity training modules that meet the current needs of our community. These trainings may range in focus from how to respond to harassment and discrimination, to how to create a positive and inclusive climate in a particular unit or department, or how to lead academic discussions on sensitive or provocative topics or events. Building on the Employee Engagement Survey results, HRSTM is rolling out a streamlined performance feedback progr am in 2020 and beyond into the next academic year starting with 360 feedback surveys in spring 2020. The goal is to ensure that supervisors and their staff across the College are having two direct conversations per year regarding areas of performance strength and professional development opportunity. Training Modules. The College has implemented new training modules to help our community better understand 265montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 47 the principles of diversity and inclusion and to illustrate how day-to-day interactions can help build a community of shared values. Implemented or expanded trainings will include: -Cultural Competency and Racial Equity T raining. Phase 1 is for embedded coaches, student assistants, peer mentors and other designated personnel. In fall 2020, all such personnel and students will commence participation in enhanced cultural competency and racial equity training with staff from the Office of Equity and Inclusion, ELITE, and/or the Office of Student Life. Topics range from how to be an eff ective advocate/ally to how to confront questionable behavior. -Unconscious Bias Training. Unconscious bias can undermine even the most fervent commitment to a diversity and inclusion agenda. MC's Unconscious Bias Training program covers an online unconscious bias assessment tool called the implicit association test. It also offers practical research-based examples of unconscious bias in hiring and other selections and strategies for combatting unconscious bias in the search process. Search committees, departments, and College leadership are using the unconscious bias training course as part of our efforts to raise awareness, particularly in the hiring process. The course will be facilitated online or in person in consultation with the Office of Equity and Inclusion. -Discrimination and Harassment Prev ention Training. Unwelcome conduct based on sex, race, sexual orientation, religion, or other protected classes can violate College policies by creating an intimidating or hostile environment. In addition to being unlawful and morally reprehensible, harassment can severely undermine an institution's efforts to fulfill its objectives in the ar ea of diversity, equity, and inclusion. This training program is available to all faculty and staff. It helps participants understand our anti-discrimination policies; explore key legal authority on harassment and discrimination in the workplace and in academic settings; and consider examples of inappropriate and unlawful conduct. -Public Safety Staff Tr aining. Public Safety personnel play a pivotal role in keeping our students safe and our campuses secure. All new Public Safety staff members receive training on issues of discrimination and harassment at the time of hire and all security staff receive annual refresher instruction. -Learning Catalog Courses. Many courses offered to MC emplo yees through the College Learning Catalog, LinkedIn Learning, address topics related to diversity and inclusion. These include classroom courses (e.g., Managing Workplace Diversity) and online offerings (e.g., Diversity on the Job and Managing Workforce Generations). In 2020, the College will launch a new learning pathway, Civility and Collegiality , and are recommending each manager with supervisory responsibility take at least two of the sessions each year. The Office of Compliance, Risk, and Ethics (OCRE). The Office of Compliance, Risk, and Ethics (OCRE) is responsible for investigating complaints of discrimination and harassment for students. Emplo yee and Labor Relation in HRSTM addresses complaints of discrimination and harassment for employees. Although we will not censor or cur tail an individual's freedom of expression, we encourage students, faculty, and staff to report hostile posts on social media and elsewhere to OCRE. OCRE reviews each incident; works with students or community members who bring forward their concerns; and works with relevant agencies, such as law enforcement or social media companies, when it finds illegal threats or harassment. -Addressing Complaints. College employ ees have the EthicsPoint confidential reporting line available for escalating concerns of any type, providing an opportunity for anonymous reports. Employees also can utilize the Roadmap for Employees to Address Concerns to gain guidance about the appropriate office to bring their concerns. Students can consult the Student Complaint Resolution website for guidance about assistance to address their concerns. The College implemented policy 39003-Protection Against Retaliation t o protect employees and students from retaliation who report concerns in good faith. Montgomery College is committed to protecting the right of faculty and students to engage in free and vigorous debate and to create an environment that is open to the expression of views that may be provocative or uncomfortable. That openness relies on respect for others in the community. Yet we know that our community is not immune from prejudice and bigotry. Our students, particularly, have shared that they are sometimes subject to bias incidents and remarks inside and outside the classroom. Education and training cannot wholly prevent discrimination, harassment, or other forms of impermissible conduct that fall outside the bounds of academic freedom and demonstrate a fundamental disrespect for others. The College takes any complaint of such activity seriously and is working to expand the 26648MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS availability of responsive channels through which to file complaints and seek action, intervention, or support. -Other Student Complaints and Incidents. The College is exploring new ways t o support our student community when incidents of bias occur. These acts, which include expressing hostility on the basis of perceived or actual identities, may not rise to the level of punishable activity or official misconduct, but they nonetheless affect our community and may contribute to an unwelcome or disrespectful envir onment for the targeted person or group and undermine the sense of community on campus. It is important for our students to know the avenues available to raise concerns, register complaints, and report serious incidents. In some cases, a response may include support for a targeted student, an opportunity to air grievances with the affected parties, or the pursuit of positive counter-expressions. In others\u2014for example, when community members are threatened or hate symbols are scrawled in shared spaces\u2014a direct and coordinated College intervention will be required. Further, a search is currently underway for a newly created position of student ombudsman. Advancement and Community Engagement (OACE) Support. OACE has been at the forefront of expanding equity and inclusion. Specifically, OACE has: Provided enhanced consistent communication to underser ved communities in Montgomery County through the strategic use of all possible media (e.g., email blasts to community contacts, monthly e-newsletter, four Facebook accounts, MCTV), promoting MC information produced by the Office of Communications, Academic Affairs, and Student Affairs, in addition to the Office of Community Engagement. Increased in-person community outreach, especially to those who ma y not see themselves as college students and in additional areas of the county (i.e., Germantown, Aspen Hill, Gaithersburg, Wheaton, Takoma Park, East County, White Oak). Strengthened services offer ed to students and prospective students at the Community Engagement Centers and Pop-up Centers (i.e., classes, workshops, advising, scholarship support, FAFSA and enrollment help, and Career Coach Assistance). Cultivated mutually beneficial partnerships with nonprofit, government, and business partners that ha ve measurable outcomes for both organizations and supported the collegewide effort for Community Engaged Teaching and Learning. Increased the number of community members who come to the campuses through e vents that facilitate intercultural understanding/neutral public dialogues, campus tours for middle school students, and other events such Summer R.I.S.E. and Take Your Child to Work Day in coordination with the Office of Compliance, Risk, and Ethics. Increase Grant Opportunities. OEI will suppor t OACE in seeking additional grant opportunities, for example, through the Bringing Theory to Practice initiative at the Association of American Colleges and Universities and Achieving the Dream racial equity institutions. The purpose will be either to extend the programming or to launch new elements that advance student equity and close achievement gaps among our \"at- promise \" students from minority, low-income, and immigrant communities. Building Community and County Outreach. Montgomery College has forged an academic community that brings together talented individuals from across the country and around the world. Diversity is a critical component of our vibrant, innovative, and open intellectual culture. It fuels, in important ways, our efforts to build a community across a broad range of views and experiences, and to engage with the societies around us. Over the past sever al years, both Workforce Development and Continuing Education and the Office of Community Engagement have worked t o meet the county's needs by strengthening external partnerships and collaborations; co-locating a new hospital on the grounds of the College's Germantown Campus to offer health care to county residents; running education and workforce development; and providing training for seniors and summer camp for young people. Our commitments and partnerships with organizations across the county have grown deeper as we work together to expand opportunity. Our commitment to our county and our neighbors is part of who we are, inherent in our work from clinic co-location and partnering with the Ethiopian Community Center at the Takoma Park/Silver Spring Campus to establishing locations in both the Wheaton and Gaithersburg libraries. We have more than 3,000 employees in Montgomery County . As Montgomery County continues to struggle with racial and multigenerational inequalities and disparities in educational opportunities and economic prospects, we must do our part to help our county realize its full potential. 267montgomerycollege.edu/about-mc/equity-and-inclusion 49 For the past two years, the Montgomery County community, including more than 1,300 incoming students, have had a chance to get acquainted with the history, culture, and food of their adopted country through the World of Montgomery event. The goal of this experience is to help students understand that Montgomery College is not only in Montgomery County , but is truly a partner of the larger world. Alumni Communities. The Montgomery College alumni community is diverse in all senses of the word. The Office of Alumni Relations works to develop and str engthen groups that foster relationships within diverse alumni populations and among alumni and students. Each group organizes activities and programs, including providing internships, jobs, training, and mentoring for alumni and students. New groups in formation will focus on Latinx and Ethiopian alumni, and those of South Asian heritage. Administrative and Fiscal Services. Future outreach efforts include: Human Resources and Strategic Talent Management will work to increase the adv ertising budget targeted at recruiting diverse faculty. Facilities will work to expand gender-neutral r estrooms, nursing stations, and produce an updated ADA Facilities Assessment. Office of Information Technology will update and implement the Information Technology Assisted/Integrativ e Technology Plan. Ongoing/General Collegewide. This academic year, the Office of Equity and Inclusion has continued signature progr amming with Pizza for Your Thoughts for students; the launch of Equity Dialogues; and an annual Equity Summit, where we had themes such as From Awareness to Action; Microaggressions; Racial Equity and Unpacking the MC Equity and Inclusion Surveys; Speak Up, Speak Out; and Changing Ourselves, Changing the Culture.Conclusion. \"The passing the baton symbolizes that we are in this work for the long run.\" \u2014Ramon de la Cruz, March 2019, PACEI committee member. When one person's race concludes, another one takes the baton further down the road. F or most students, Montgomery College represents hope for a better life and more opportunities. Each member of the MC community is aware that each day that we walk into our classrooms, office, building, library , board room, and/or campus, we are there because we belie ve that education is a force that empowers. The work getting to equitable and inclusive practices does not magically happen because we are aware or somehow enlightened. The Cycle of Change Model is a process, a methodology (page 5). It does not happen overnight; nor do we get to a place where we can wrap up our work in a pretty bow and say, \"We are done here.\" No, this work is ongoing, continual, day by day . Prior to the completion of this Roadmap, the COVID-19 pandemic caused unexpected and unprecedented changes to normal College operations. As a direct result of the pandemic, inequities have derailed dreams, goals, and lives. Now, more than ever, we need to step up to the plate and take action. What we seek is radical inclusion. What it will take is all of us committing to using this Roadmap for Success as a guide. This guide will help our Montgomery College community get further down that r oad toward equitable outcomes and radical inclusion, and the implementation of the objectives herein will help move us further towards being among the most equitable and inclusive community colleges in the United States. In this new era, the Roadmap is not just a guide but a testament to what the MC community is capable of accomplishing. 26850MONTGOMERY COLLEGE \u00b7 OFFICE OF EQUITY AND INCLUSION ROADMAP FOR SUCCESS XI.

Implicit in the ableist perspective is the belief that disability is a negative status. However, rather than attempting to \"fix\" people with disabilities so that they will \"fit\" into an ableist society, advocates address the oppressive culture. Emplo ys concepts such as social justice, liberation, and oppression to analyze, evaluate, and transform systems of social behavior, discriminatory institutional structures, and cultural practices (M. Adams, Bell, & Griffin, 2007). The focus is on ableism\u2014the oppression of people with disabilities. Postulates: (a) Focus on privilege and oppr ession. (b) Emphasis on diversity and intersectionality of experiences, roles, and identities. (c) Goal of educating both individuals with disabilities and those who are not disabled about the existence of disability oppression. Practitioners can use the concept of ableism to analyze and assess their campus environment and departmental policies. Rather than locating the problem within the individual with a disability, practitioners can use the social justice model to change oppressive components of the broader culture, including ideas (e.g., beauty, independence, normality), policies (e.g., laws), and attitudes (e.g., paternalism, pity, sympathy). Evans, Nancy J. Disability in Higher Education (p. 90). Wiley. Kindle Edition. Disability Justice Model:Disability is a political experience of oppression, understandable only in interaction with experiences of other social identities (e.g., socioeconomic status, race, gender , sexual orientation). Disability justice advocates argue that disability is a political experience of oppression that can be understood only in the context of multiissue commitment to social justice. They argue that access is a baseline, but the goal is transforming society to function for all people and value inter dependence. Disability must be addressed alongside other forms of oppression on campus, including racism, sexism, and other efforts to create more inclusive campuses. All members of the campus should recognize, value, and support interdependent, rather than independent, relationships. Accessibility should be considered a minimal standard, and what is being made accessible must function for all community members. Evans, Nancy J. Disability in Higher Education (p. 90). Wiley.

The committee of twenty -two members was given several charges which includ ed develop ing an institutional cultural diversity plan that include d mission - driven goals for improvi ng cultural diversity, specific areas of emphasis, diversity training, strategies for implementation, and methods of evaluation. In addition to developing a four -year cultural diversity plan during the 2013 -2014 academic year , the committee focused one of its efforts on developing a definition of diversity for the College. A sub -committee was established to spearhead this effort. The development of the definition included looking at diversity language in college documents and researching definitions at other institutions and organizations . A chat was set up in the committee's Blackboard account for input from all committee members. Thoughts about the definition were shared by the sub -committee to the larger committee, and discussions were held at each D iversity Committee meeting. During these deliberations, t he members of the Diversity Committee decided to have a definition that encompass ed more than cultural diversity. The drafted definition of diversity was shared with the College community via the College -wide Forum - the College's governance structure which includes participation from all members of the college community. It was also shared in other venues which include d the Values Training offered by the Center for Professional Development. The fo llowing definition of diversity was presented to the President and ultimately to the members of the Board of Trustees: Prince George's Community College supports and embraces cultural diversity, understood as the creation and promotion of an inclusive, non-discriminatory environment for everyone. We accept and value differences, including differences in age, race, national origin, ethnicity, religious affiliation, political beliefs, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic background, and ability/disability. We strive for growth and success for all of our students, employees, business partners, and the community. The definition was approved by the Board of Trustees in July of 2014. This definition was incorporated into the structure of the Co llege through the inclusion in documents and programs such as employee recruitment materials , professional development resources, and new employee onboarding sessions . A card with the diversity definition was created to distribute to all first -time full -time students through the required first year experience course - PAS 1010. 297Successful Ongoing and New Institutional Initiatives During academic year 2 014-2015 , the Diversity Committee created a forum , \"Diversity Round Tables,\" where topics related to diversity could be discussed with all members of the college community. To ensure that this was a learning experience, the Center for Professional Development held a Facilitators Workshop that was attended by members of the Divers ity Committee and other employees to create a pool of professionals to lead the dialogues . The first three Diversity Round Table Discussions were : \"The Deaf and Hearing Impaired Community\" \"Disrupting Inequality\" \"The LBGTQ Community\" This forum has been ongoing and w as renamed several years ago to \"Promoting Inclusi on - Getting to Know You Conversations.\" The most recent conversation, \"The Chauvin Verdict: Looking Back, Moving Forward\" was held on May 12, 2021. Attendance for the conversations has increased in the virtual format. Two new institutional initiatives were held this year - the Thirty Day s For Change Challenge and the College's first Diversity Week. The staff, faculty and students at Prince George's Community College spent 30 days in September and October committed to learning about racial injustice in America in an effort to enact change. The members of the C ollege community were involved in daily experiences/activities geared to ward facilitating learning and motivating change with respect to race and justice. Each day during the challenge w as devoted to reading, listening, watching, or acting - moving together toward mutual understanding, equality, and justice. The list of activiti es is provided in the appendix. The College's first D iversity Week was held virtually March 29 - April 2, 2021. A college -wide taskforce was established to assist with organizing the event. The taskforce collaborated with various college departments and programs to offer a variety of workshops and activities that celebrated diversity. They include d: The Financial Empowerment Center (FEC), the Diversity Committee , the Office of Student Engagement & Leadership , the Center for Performing Arts, Women of Wis dom (WOW), Reflections Literary Arts Magazine, and the Library. Collectively, over 500 people participated in Diversity Week. The Diversity Week flyer is in the a ppendix . The efficacy of these initiatives is measured via evaluations that are provided to participants following the conversations and programs. It has also been measured through the comparative results of the baseline data obtained from the diversity questions included in the administration of the Higher Education Survey of Employee Engageme nt (HESEE) , the Community College Survey of Student Engagement (CCSSE) , and the PACE Climate Survey. 298Anticipated Effects of COVID -19 on Diversity Efforts A Student Experience Survey was conducted at PGCC in Fall 2020. The survey, which was open from October 7 to November 6, received 2,677 responses, including credit and continuing education students. Students with different goals were represented in the sample: 49% were after an Associate or Certificate degree as their primary goal, 16% saw as their primary intent to transfer to a 4-yr institution, and 18% were attending courses primarily for self-enrichment. The survey asked about \"Learning/education issues that have been a challenge for you within the virtual learning environment.\" The analysis showed similarities and differences in the student experience when comparing responses by race/ethnicity. For a significant percentage in all groups, \"Difficulty focusing or paying attention to virtual instruction or activities\" was still a challenge. However, the percentage of respondents who responded that this was still a challenge was larger for Hispanic students (44%) and white students (43%), compared to Asian students (31%) and Black/African American students (32%, see Chart below). Based on these results, the College continues to devote resources to professional development for instructors, and has expanded the availability of learning modalities for summer 2021. In addition to the traditional face to face, asynchronous online, and hybrid modes available prior to the pandemic, the College now offers a synchronous online modality, whereby students and instructors meet virtually at scheduled times for instruction. A new option has also been added for hybrid classes, which pairs synchronous virtu al learning with face-to-face learning. There has actually been a positive effect on access to diversity programming along with an increase in attendance numbers. With the shift to distance education modalities limiting the ability to provide in- person programming, it did not limit the amount of programming that occurred. Diversity programming moved to the Zoom platform which provided greater access to presenters external to the College and provided the ability to program at times that may not have been suited to in-person scheduling. While there may be a negative impact for some populations among our students in terms of enrollment and persistence, the Fall term will serve as the first indicator of these lessons or activities that haven't translated well to a virtual environmentDifficulty focusing or paying attention to virtual instruction or activitiesUnclear expectations around course/assignment requirementsLearning/education issues that have been a challenge for you within the virtual learning (% Still a Challenge) Asian Black or African American Hispanic White 299 APPENDIX 300Prince George's Community College 30 Days For Change Initiative - Fall 2020 September 28 Watch: Megan Ming Francis' \"Let's Get \"Birth -Day,\" by Lucille Clifton Reflect: What waits inside you like an ache?

Dukes 306INTRODUCTION Prince George's Community College is one of only two community colleges in the state of Maryland that services a credit student body made up primarily of minority students. However, the College continues to focus on those areas that require attention to i nsure that our diversity mirrors that of the county and continues to educate students to be fully engaged in a diverse nation and world. PGCC has long recognized the importance of equal opportunity and diversity in education and includes diversity as one of the College's core values. This means that the College promotes opportunities to expand the worldview of students and employees through exposure to and a greater understanding of all peoples, cultures, and lifestyles. This also means that members of t he College community collaborate across the College while understanding that everyone brings something to the table. MISSION STATEMENT The college's current vision and mission are as follows. Vision Prince George's Community College is the region's premier center for innovations in learning, community engagement, and strategic partnerships that inspire educational, career, and personal success. Mission Prince George's Community College provides affordable, high -quality learning experiences that supp ort personal, professional, and educational development for diverse populations contributing to the economic equity and cultural vibrancy of our community.

The plan has mission -driven goals for improving diversity wit h specific areas of emphasis that include diversity training and education, infusing diversity into the curriculum, recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in the workforce and the student population, and programmatic efforts focused on creati ng an inclusive environm ent. During the 2013 -2014 academic year, the Committee on Cultural Diversity developed the following definition of diversity: Prince George's Community College supports and embraces cultural diversity, understood as the creati on and promotion of an inclusive, non -discriminatory environment for everyone. We accept and value differences, including differences in age, race, national origin, ethnicity, religious affiliation, political beliefs, sexual orientation, gender identity, s ocioeconomic background, and ability/disability. We strive for growth and success for all of our students, employees, business partners, and the community. This definition was shared with the college community in multiple venues and was ultimately approv ed by the Board of Trustees. INSTITUTIONAL PLAN TO IMPROVE CULTURAL DIVERSITY FY2019 -2021 The development of the current diversity plan was written in concert with the College's FY 2019 -2021 strategic plan and falls under the Regional Impact goal . The college's strategic goals are intended to focus the institution in a manner that will facilitate its ability to leverage strengths and resources that best serve its mission for the period defined by this strategic plan. Prince George's Community College will focus on: Student Success: Creating and sustaining optimal conditions for students to design and achieve academic, career, and personal goals. Regional Impact: Driving strategic partnerships to identify and respond to the region's present and future priorities. Organizational Excellence: Creating and sustaining agile, effective, and efficient institutional synergies.

Office Responsible: Research, Assessment and Effectiveness 313Plan for Program of Cultural Diversity : How Diversity was Defined Wor-Wic Community College is committed to a plan of cultural diversity that promotes inclusivity of diverse students and employees. The college has created a welcoming atmosphere on campus and has infused cultural diversity in all college programs, services, and communications. The college has demonstrated this commitment to cultural diver sity through its vision, values, mission, and goals stated in the institutional strategic plan. The strategic plan of the college is in alignment with the diversity goals of the Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education, including implementation stra tegies and timelines for meeting the goals. Wor-Wic Community College de velops its strategic plan every five years and annually reviews plan progress. In 2016, the college held its annual series of three planning council meetings to review institutional progress on its strategic planning priorities. At that time, the college adopted a five -year strategic plan, \"Strengthening the Community through Education and Training\" and used the planning meetings to re-examine its institutional mission , vision , and core values . The values approved at that time were accessibility, community, diversity, integrity, innovation, learning, and excellence. During the 2011 -2016 strategic plan, \"diversity \" was defined as follows: Diversity is the dynamic variety of peop le and ideas that promote greater skill and wisdom and enhance institutional vitality. All members of the community have a right to contribute to and benefit from the college's institutional life. The college protects and welcomes a diversity of freely exc hanged and critically considered perspectives and approaches in the learning and working process. (Rising to the Challenge, p.6) Upon revision, t he 2016 -2021 strategic planning document define d diversity as \"embracing all people, ideas and experiences by providing an inclusive and supportive environment. \" The 2016 -2021 strategic plan has four priorities: increase student success, address community needs, improve institutional effectiveness and ensure a high -quality workforce. Each priority has stated goals tied to Wor-Wic's mission, vision and values. Strat egic priority teams were formed and developed action plans to address the priorities, and individual departments throughout the college established measurable actions and performance measures aligned with the strategic priorities and goals. To determine th e future priorities, t he strategic planning process involved three planning council meetings comprised of students, employees , and community stakeholders . A community forum was held on campus where individual community members discussed the college's role within their communities and their vision fo r the college . With the combined input from the college's stakeholders and the planning council, the board of trustees determined the direction of the college for the next five years. Due to the pandemic and its impact on institutional success, the 2016 -2021 strategic plan has been extended to 2022 . A sixth year was added to give the college an additional year of outcomes . As a result , the college will have five full years of data to review without the instability of the pandemic year. The college will hold its annual strategic planning meetings in spring 2022 , will review data from the previous five years, determine new strategic priorities, and discuss whether a three - or five -year planning cycle is needed. 314Plan for Program of Cultural Diversity: Successful Initiatives The college's most successful ongoing and new institutional initia tives designed to address issues related to cultural diversity within the campus and broader community include activities involving cultural diversity, arts programming, grant supported activities , and continuing education . Wor-Wic's cultural diversity committe e and the arts and humanities department Echoes and Visions writers' series shifted programming methods from in -person to online platforms due to the pandemic . Both groups used Zoom , an online platform, in FY 2021 . Event audiences have include d individuals who normally would not attend on -campus events, with individuals from across Maryland and the U.S. versus audiences usually from the college's three -county service area. Additionally, through use of the online platform, both groups minimized t ravel and lodging expenses for presenters. Further, Zoom events were tracked with online polls (surveys) for additional audience demographics. Discussion by committee leader s is needed to determine if continued use of the online platforms will be come implemented post-pandemic . Wor-Wic has been awarded various grants that focus on student access and retention. A TRIO Student Support Services (SSS) Program grant through the U.S. Department of Education was approved for a second time in the summer of 2020. The grant, which spans a five -year period, is funded to serve 144 students with individualized support services to increase persistence, retention, academic standing and graduation/transfer. SSS Participants include at-risk students who are low income, first generation and/or students with disabilities. Support services include a needs assessment, intrusive advising, coaching, personal counseling, tutoring and supplemental instruction in the college's student develop ment course. The grant is responsible for multiple metrics that relate to program eligibility, disabilities, student persistence, and certificate and/or degree attainment. SSS Program eligibility data requires that at least two -thirds of the program partic ipants served during the project should be low -income and first -generation, students with disabilities, or students with disabilities who are low -income. At the conclusion of the grant's first year of its five -year grant cycle, 107 of the 144 students (74. 31%) met eligibility the criteria. During the same year, participants' ethnicity was measured Hispanic (11.80%) and Non -Hispanic (88.19%), and participants' race as American Indian or Alaskan Native (1.38%), Asian (2.77%), Black or African (45.13%), and Wh ite (49.30%) . Reinforcing the state plan strategy 3 to provide support services to non -traditional students, the college's veterans center provides academic, career and other support services to Lower Eastern Shore veterans who are low income or potential first-generation college students and/or veterans who have a high risk for academic failure. The center receives funding from a TRIO Veterans Upward Bound (VUB) grant and is run by a full - time director of veterans services, whose position is funded by the grant and the college. In FY 2021, the college was in its fourth year of the grant and 125 eligible veterans were assisted through the center. Participants' race reveals American Indian (2%), Asian (1%), Black or African American (39%), and White (54%), an d 88 males and 37 females. Data reveals students who complete the VUB program are more successful than non -VUB students. Students who complete VUB and enroll at Wor -Wic have a cumulative 2.89 GPA versus non VUB students with a 2.65 GPA. The VUB retention r ate is higher as students who complete VUB and enroll at Wor -Wic with a retention rate of 68% versus non -VUB students with a retention rate of 49%. Wor -Wic was named as a 2021 silver -level Military Friendly School by VIQTORY, a national company that ranks colleges and universities in their support for veteran and military students. Wor -Wic is the only community college in Maryland to be selected as a Military Friendly school . 315Plan for Program of Cultural Diversity: Impact of COVID -19 on Diversity As with colleges and universities across the U.S., the pandemic had an immediate impact on Wor -Wic's course delivery and student access to services . Initially, the college closed for one week in mid -March 2020 to allow instruction to fully transfer to on line and then resume d classes on March 23, 2020 . The primary issues students experienced transferring to online instruction were many students had never enrolled in online course s, did not possess technology that allowed them to complete coursework remotely , and/or had limited Internet access in remote rural areas. The college expanded its Internet so that students could access Wi-Fi from parking lots and complete courses online at the campus . Similarly, for certain testing s ituations , the college expanded its services to include online proctors to monitor student testers. In preparation for FY 2021, the college expanded its onlin e offerings to include multiple virtua l learning modalities , including virtual, hybrid -on campus/virtual, and hybrid -virtual online . Below are additional credit, non -credit, and student communities impacted at the college by the pandemic: Enhanced Diversity Spanish courses were shifted to online only for the spring 2020 semester. For the fall 2020 & spring 2021 semesters, there were more online course offerings as well as split hybrid classes. In course evaluations, students noted that the recorded lectures o ffered great explanations that were extremely helpful when completing the Supersite activities and other course assessments (exams, composition, and oral presentations). When classes resumed in -person class activity, the Continuing Education Workforce Dev elopment (CEWD) College Prep ESL classes (Reading for Speakers of Other Languages, Grammar and Writing Skills for Speakers of Other Languages and Listening and Speaking Skills for Speakers of Other Languages) were offered in both fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters. The classes filled to maximum capacity in the spring 2021. As a result, a waitlist was created. In the past, the classes had a history of cancellations due to low enrollment. Negatively Enhanced Diversity There was an 11.4% decline in the number of FAFSAs completed by March 1 this year versus March 1 last year. This decline might be disproportionally felt among low -income students that might not have access to technology , though the financial aid office does not track FAFSA completion by de mographic groups . The pandemic brought Wor -Wic Community College's Second Chance Pell program to a complete halt. This program provided college level courses to thirty inmates at Eastern Shore Correctional Center and, thus far, the program has not been a ble to resume. Of those thirty students, there were six that could have potentially earned a degree in 2020 if the pandemic had no t occur red. For the Veteran and military populations, the effect of COVID were significant and prevented students from coming to campus and utilize numerous on -campus activities and resources. In addition to a preference for the in -person learning modality, the follow ing items were impacted: Veterans Upward Bound (VUB) Resource Center under restricted access; Veteran -military student lounge closed and then under restricted access; and Veterans and Memorial Day ceremonies cancelled on campus. 316Wor -Wic Community College Cultural Diversity Plan 2020 -2021 I. Implementation Strategy and Timeline for Meeting Goals Goal: Utilize planning council updates , cultural diversity committee activities, and other related college data to develop the annual review and submission of the college' s cultural diversity plan. Wor-Wic Community College is committed to a plan of cultural diversity that promotes inclusivity of diverse students and employees. The college has created a welcoming atmosphere on campus and has infused cultural diversity in all college programs, services, and communications. The college has demonstrated this commitment to cultural diversity through its vision, values, mission, and goals stated in the institu tional strategic plan. The strategic plan of the college is in alignment with the diversity goals of the Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education, including implementation strategies and timelines for meeting the goals. The college's report on the cultural diversity initiatives, submitted to Maryland Higher Education Commission ( MHEC ) in Septembe r, is inclusive of culturally diverse institutional activities and events involving curriculum, academic program changes , recruitment, and social events impacting the college's students, faculty, staff, and stakeholders . In support of the annual report, the cultural diversity committee, formed in 2009 as part of the college's initial cultural diversity initiative, conducts an annual review of the college's cultural diversity plan and organizes events that promote an awareness, understanding and appreciatio n of diverse racial, ethnic and cultural groups. The committee meets a minimum of four times a year to plan events and is comprised of students, staff, and faculty representatives. The committee's r ecommendation s are forwarded to the vice president for aca demic affairs for approval . The committee develops an annual theme and is awarded a budget to support multiple events related to the theme. Committee events are planned in the summer months and held in the fall and spring semesters and during the initial summer session. Events span various topics including musical performances, poetry readings, cultural presentations based on countries of origin, political topics, LGBTQI, book discussions, and thematic months (Women's History, African American History, Lati no American, History, etc.) and are held in person and on Zoom. The college will use r eports from the institutional research department, cultural diversity committee event evaluations , annual planning council updates, and other data sources to report progress on the implementation of the plan to MHEC and updat e the college's cultural diversity plan. Below is a timeline for the cultural diversity committee and progress with the college's cultural diversity plan: 317CULTURAL DIVERSITY COMMITTEE TIMELINE FY 2020 Date Meeting/Responsible Person Purpose May 27, 2020 Cancelled due to closed college for the pandemic .

As a result, the cultural diversity committee will not host events in fall 2020 but will host events in spring 2021 through Zoom or another online video platform . Herein are the proposed 2020 committee events: 318Date Action January 2021 Bulletin board with theme and spring events Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Workshop (Zoom) February 2021 Faculty cultural presentation (Zoom) African American History Month Book Discussion (Zoom) March 2021 Faculty cultural presentation (Zoom) Microaggressions and biases presentation (Zoom) April 2021 Book discussion (international author) (Zoom) Diversity and inclusive communication presentation (Zoom) June 2021 Faculty cultural presentation (Zoom) II. Addressing Cultural Diversity among Students, Faculty, and Staff Goal: To attain diverse faculty and staff representation reflective of the college's three - county service area. In addition to efforts to increase the diversity of its student population, Wor -Wic aims to increase diversity of its staff and faculty. Eighteen percent of full - and part -time employees at Wor -Wic are minorities. Although this percentage is lower than the state average for all Maryland community colleges (3 7%), it is higher than the average for all small Maryland community college s (10%). According to the 20 20 Performance Accountability Report Indicator #11, of the seven small Maryland community colleges, Wor -Wic has the fourth highest percentage ( 8.5%) of full-time credit faculty who are minority. Wor -Wic has reached almost 71% of its benchmark of 12% for minority faculty. Wor -Wic ranks first among the seven small community colleges in the percent of full -time administrative/professional staff who are minorities. Wor -Wic's percentage increased to 20.7 % in the fall of 2019 . The college has exceeded its benchmark of 14 % (20 20 Performance Accountability Report Indicator #12) every year since fall 2016 . These data demonstrate the college's continued commitment toward the promotion of diversity among faculty, staff and students. To that end, the college strives to develop and maintain a diverse workforce of staff and faculty representative of its service area. Wor-Wic Community College uses a combination of recruiting tools to attract minority applicants, including (a) advertising thro ugh an organization that ensures our postings are promoted on hundreds of relevant job aggregators, national sites, industry sites, and local sites, as well as on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook using targeted campaigns, and (b) the use of aff irmative action emails through higheredjobs.com, which reaches more than 330,000 minority job applicants. For FY19, 37% of applicants who self -disclosed their race identified as minority. According to the U.S. Census Bureau (2018), 39% of Wicomico County i s represented by minority groups and 21% of Worcester County is represented by minority groups. The average for both counties is 30%. It appears we continue to be successful at ensuring our applicant pool is diverse. As of June 30, 2019, 19% of all standa rd and grant employees identify as minorities. Based on the MACC 2020 Databook, minority statistics for all full -time and part -time employees at Wor - Wic are higher than all the other small community colleges in Maryland. 319Faculty and Staff Cultural Training Programs To ensure employees encourage and respect diversity, and understand the laws regarding discrimination and harassment, all new employees complete Title IX in Higher Education web training during their first week of employment. The training is typically completed in the human resources office on the employee's first day of work. The training provides information to new employees about Title IX, including the protection from discrimination it offers to students and employees. The tra ining also covers sexual harassment, violence, and assault on and off campus, and makes it clear that discriminatory practices and retaliation will not be tolerated. Several key employees attend off -site Title IX trainings that are offered by the Associati on of Title IX Administrators, Maryland Title IX Consortium, Association of Title IX Administrators (ATIXA), and the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault, to name a few. H uman resources also bring trainers to campus to cover diverse topics. Fiscal y ear 2021 will be a unique year for college -wide training due to the COVID -19 pandemic and expected lockdowns, social distancing, and remote work. The training modality will shift to mandatory web -based and self -paced sessions and remote webinars. Diversity topics will include Implicit Bias and Micro -aggression Awareness. Additional training will include Title IX and Sexual Harassment (various titles), Sexual Violence Awareness (Campus SaVE Act for employees); and several sessions on interpersonal topics including conflict management, communication to improve relationships, active listening , difficult conversations, and emotional intelligence. III. Enhancing Cultural Diversity Goal: Conduct annual review of college initiatives to identify opportunities for improvement in enhancing cultural diversity . In addition to attracting minority applicants, Wor -Wic's human resources ( HR) department helps search committee members conduct effective interviews that comply with anti -discrimination laws. An HR representative meets with each search committee prior to every search to discuss the recruitment process. Employees receive tools about acceptable and unacceptable questions, as well as training on various interviewing topics. HR reviews and modifies all interview questions to remove chances of discrimination in the hiring process. The college recently created a new strategic priority and assigned a priority team to \"ensure a high -quality workforce by enhancing recruitment and hiring practices, addres sing staffing needs and providing equity in compensation.\" Three major goals were established, including the goal to increase diversity in faculty and administrative positions. An ad -hoc committee was formed to (a) initiate branding efforts to facilitate r ecruitment efforts, (b) review hiring practices and make recommendations to improve the diversity of search committees, and (c) modify recruitment strategies to attract diverse candidates. The new HR pages of the college's website were designed based on th e committee's input. In addition, a new procedure for selecting search committees was proposed and related policy revisions were approved by the board of directors and published in the policy and procedures manual in January 2020. HR will continue to moni tor and strengthen minority staff and faculty recruitment efforts to ensure employees who represent diverse characteristics are included in the talent search process. 320 IV. Process for Reporting Campus -Based Hate Crimes Goal: Publicize the annual campus -based hate crimes report and assess new student understanding of campus -based hate crimes. In response to the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, the college's hate crime policy and procedures for reporting a crime is found in the safety and security section of the college's policy and procedures manual (PPM). In addition, hate c rime statistics can be found in the college's annual security report which is prepared, published, and distributed by the director of public safety. The annual security report is updated and posted by October 1, and a copy of the report can be accessed on the college website at https://www.worwic.edu/WorWic/media/ServicesSupport/PublicSafety/AnnSecRpt.pdf , or a copy can be obtained by contacting the director of pu blic safety at (410) 334 -2936 . Further , the policy is defined in in the Public Safety section (Appendix F) of the college's catalog and the safety and security section of the catalog's appendix includes the hate crime policy and procedures for reporting the crime. SDV 100 Fundamentals of College Study is a one -credit new student experience course required in every program of study at the college. The course reviews study skills, time management, college policies, and strategies for student success. In addition, the course encompasses information on Title IX sexual assault and campus hate -based crime is included in the course content. Annual course data will be reported as to the percentage of students in the course indicate knowledge of campus hate -based crimes. V. Resources Needed by the Institution to Effectively Recruit and Retain Culturally Diverse Students Goal: Use grant program best practices for retaining culturally diverse students to increase institutional student recruitment and marketing strategies. Initially, Wor -Wic was chartered as \"a community college to serve the postsecondary vocational and technical education needs of the residents of Worcester and Wicomico counties,\" but a year later was approved to serve residents in Somerset County, one of t he most economically challenged counties in the State of Maryland. As noted in its mission, Wor -Wic Community College is \"...a comprehensive community college that enhances local economic growth by addressing the educational, training and workforce develop ment needs of the residents of Worcester, Wicomico and Somerset counties. The college serves a diverse student body through its high quality, affordable educational offerings and comprehensive support services designed to facilitate student goal completion .\" Wor-Wic continues to seek state, local, and private grant funding to enhance all institutional initiatives, especially support that will strengthen instructional services, equipment, and programs for underrepresented populations, learning disabled, an d first -generation racial and 321ethnic minorities. Wor-Wic has been awarded various grants that focus on student access and retention. Currently, the college has two Title IV funded educational programs to serve its first- generation, economically disadvanta ged, learning -disabled students and veterans . A TRIO Student Support Services (SSS) Program grant through the U.S. Department of Education was approved for a second time in the summer of 2020. The grant, which spans a five - year period, is funded to serve 144 students with individualized support services to increase persistence, retention, academic standing and graduation/transfer. SSS Participants include at - risk students who are low income, first generation and/or students with disabilities. Support servi ces include a needs assessment, intrusive advising, coaching, personal counseling, tutoring and supplemental instruction in the college's student development course. The grant is responsible for multiple metrics that relate to program eligibility, disabili ties, student persistence, and certificate and/or degree attainment. SSS Program eligibility data requires that at least two - thirds of the program participants served during the project should be low -income and first - generation, students with disabilities, or students with disabilities who are low -income. Program assessment is conducted annually and data used for the cultural diversity plan will included the following points: (1) number of students meeting eligibility criteria; and (2) percentage of partici pants by ethnicity. Reinforcing the state plan strategy 3 to provide support services to non -traditional students, the college's veterans center provides academic, career and other support services to Lower Eastern Shore veterans who are low income or pote ntial first -generation college students and/or veterans who have a high risk for academic failure. The center receives funding from a TRIO Veterans Upward Bound (VUB) grant and is run by a full -time director of veterans' services, whose position is funded by the grant and the college. In FY 2021, the college will be in its fourth year of the grant . Program assessment is conducted annually , and data used for the cultural diversity plan will included the following points: ( 1) Number of eligible veterans assisted through the center ; (2) Percentage of participants by ethnicity ; (3) Success of participants in VUB as Wor - Wic students including student with respect to percentage of completers, grade point average, and retention r ate; and (4) Recognition of college as a Military Friendly School The two federally funded grant programs have serve d about ten percent of Wor -Wic's credit enrollment. Both programs have shown significant progress with the targeted populations outlined in their grant proposals and yearly updates . An examination of the grant programs' best practices with respect to retention of culturally diverse students will be used to increase recruitment and marketing strategies for new students. 322 70 1 E.

Moreover, we have assessed, and will continue to assess, our role in perpetuating structural racism and are committed to establishing and promoting anti -racist policies and anti -racist actions and dismantling structural racism within the University System itself; elevating issues of race and racism in our teaching, research, and scholarship; and redressing racial inequities and advanc ing social justice in our own communities using the following framework to move Toward Racial Equity and Justice by examining: Equity and Climate in the USM The USM will evaluate whether we treat our own people right, fairly, with equitable opportunity. Among the issues we'll examine are college access and success among Black students; college affordability; diversity among faculty, staff, and leadership; promotion, tenure, and compensation among faculty and employees; implicit bias and cultural competency training; hate crime and hate bias protocols; and training for campus police and safety officers. Education and Research at the USM The USM will examine how our universities are teaching issues of race, racism, and social justice; how our curricula in these areas compare to national exemplars and best practices; and what opportunities exist for novel research to advance our understanding of diversity, equity, inclusion, and bias. Service Mission at the USM The USM will examine how we apply our knowledge to eliminate racial disparities and social injustice, and how we involve students in this work. We will collaborate with partners in education, anti- poverty, workforce development, criminal justice, health care, and policy research to develop productive and sustainable experiential learning and engagement programs. (https://www.usmd.edu/usm/workgroups/diversity/ ) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ In 2008, the Maryland General Assembly began r equiring higher education institutions to develop, implement, and submit a plan for a program of cultural diversity to the Maryland Higher Educ ation Commission (MHEC). Additionally, institutions must submit annual progress reports to MHEC summarizing institutional progress toward the implementation of i ts plan for cultural diversity. In 2020, in light of the COVID public health emergency, MHEC extended the due date for the cultural diversity reports. The 2020 reports were received by Education Policy and Student Life and approved by the Board of Regents in September 2020. Since one full year has not passed since the last iteration of this report was due, MHEC streamlined the requirements for this year's Cultural Diversity Report. Guidance notes : \"This year's report is designed to minimize the reporting burden on institutions while ensuring that each institution continues to make progress with the diversity goals of the State Plan. In accordance with this, each institutional submission should include a brief narrative (n o more than three pages), consisting of the sections outlined below. Please ensure all submissions adhere to these guidelines. Additional supplemental information such as data analysis or more comprehensive programmatic information may be provided as an ap pendix, but the core narrative should not exceed this three -page limit.\" The sections of the narrative pertain to: (1) how the institution defines diversity; (2) successful ongoing and new institutional DEI initiatives; and (3) COVID -19's effects on efforts to enhance diversity. 326 Page 2 of 11 In addition, institutions must provide, as an appendix, their current Institutional Plan for Cultural Diversity . The plans are required by \u00a711-406 of the Education Article, which states that each public institution of higher education in the State shall develop and implement a plan for a program of cultural diversity that enhances cultural diversity programming and sensitivity to cultural diversity through instruction and training of the student body, faculty, and staff at the institution of higher education. The plan should include: i. Implementation strategy and a timeline for meeting goals within the plan; ii. A description of the way the institution addresses cultural diversity among its student, faculty, and staff populations; iii. A description of how the institution plans to enhance cultural diversity (if improvement is needed); iv. A process for reporting campus -based hate crimes; and v. A summary of any resources, including State grants, needed by the institution to effectively recruit and retain a culturally -diverse student body. Finally, USM's Office of Academic and Student Affairs requested an addendum in which institutions described their top two or three areas of growth and/or challenge as it pertains to diversity, equity, inclusion, and/or dismantling structural racism. The following report includes examples and themes found across USM's 12 institut ions for each narrative section. Although the themes help us understand the USM as a whole, institutions' responses are illuminating. To experience the full scope of the ir work , please refer to institutions' complete reports . Section 1 How does the institution define diversity; how did the institution develop that definition ? The original intent of this state-mandated report was to address racial diversity. However, each USM institution 's definition of diversity extends beyond race to gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity, religion, ability, socioeconomic status, and beyond. They also factor in diversity of thought and opinion. All acknowledge striving for greater diversit y among those demographics and share ways they are working towards t hat goal. Moreover, although the prompt was narrowly worded, many USM institutions described the extent to which their definition of diversity includes a welcoming and inclusive community and campus climate. This focus on inclusion is aligned with what has been described in diversity reports from the last several years and with the Equity and Climate element of the USM framework. It is important to note that numerical diversity was very rarely mentioned in institutions' descriptions. One notable exception is the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science where underrepresented minority students are less present in the environmental and marine sciences than in many other STEM disciplines . Subsequently, the institution focuses on those metrics in addition to inclusion and climate. Highlights from institutions' descriptions of diversity include: Bowie State University The University community believes its educational environment is enriched by the diversity of individuals, groups, and cultures that come together in a spirit of learning. As the University aspires to even greater racial diversity, it fully embraces the global definition of diversity that acknowledges and recognizes differences and advances knowledge about race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, political persuasion, culture, sexual orientation, religion, age, and disability. Coppin State University The University is committed to the full realization of its historic promise to recognize and nurture merit, talent, and achievement by supporting diversity and equal opportunity in its education, services, and administration, as well as research and creative activity. 327 Page 3 of 11 Frostburg State University The University a ffirms its commitment to a campus environment which values human diversity and respects individuals who represent that diversity. The community declares fostering diversity and respect for difference to be a fundamental goal of higher education, ranking among the highest priorities of th e institution. Salisbury University Inclusion means creating an environment of respect, connection and involvement among people with different experiences and perspectives. Salisbury strives to create a truly div erse and inclusive environment where the richness of ideas, backgrounds , and perspectives of the community is harnessed to create value for the institution, today and in the future. Towson University Towson continues to strive to be the most diverse institution in the USM. It recognizes that it must also include in this goal the mission to become equitable and inclusive so that all members of the community can thrive. University of Baltimore Diversity is a situation that includes representation of multiple (ideally all) groups within a prescribed environment, such as a university or a workplace... (There is) an emphasis on accepting and respecting cultural differences by recognizing that no one culture is intrinsically superior to another. UBalt strives for diversity to strengthen the professional, intellectual, and cultural experiences of all members of the UBalt community. University of Maryland, Baltimore The University is committed to a culture enriched by diversity and inclusion, in the broadest sense, in thoughts, actions, and leadership. UMB pledges to embrace cultural competence , which responds respectfully and effectively to all people in a manner that recognizes, affirms, and values the worth of individuals, families, and communities and protects and preserves the dignity of each (all).\" The university community commits to self -assessing and strengthening its cultural competence by creating a climate that celebrates diversity and inclusion. University of Maryland, Baltimore County Diversity is defined in its fullest scope, embracing not only racial and ethnic groups and individuals who are or have been underrepresented in higher education, but also including religious affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, nationality, non- traditional student status, as well as other important characteristics. UMBC will advance knowledge, economic prosperity, and social justice by welcoming and inspiring inquisitive minds from all backgrounds. University of Maryland, College Park Diversity is th e full spectrum of human identities, backgrounds, experiences, and thei r intersections. UMD's work advocates a strategic balance of these factors as understood through the lens of institutional and societal power. University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Diversity means more than just acknowledging and/or tol erating difference. It is a set of conscious practices that seek to understand, appreciate , and value the interdependence of humanity, cultures, and the natural environment. University of Maryland Eastern Shore Diversity is marked by an i nclusive community that reflects the world beyond the Eastern Shore that challenges and encourages the broadening of perspectives and worldviews , and helps to fully prepare students to make valuable contributions as citizens of a diverse and globally integrated soc iety. University of Maryland Global Campus Diversity is considered to be valuing individual differences through action and ensuring that all are doing the right thing for the UMGC Community. UMGC Inclusion efforts focus on all the ways UMGC respect s and welcomes people who are different into the UMGC Community through the removal of systemic barriers and through promoting equity and fairness for all. 328 Page 4 of 11 Section 2 A brief highlight of the most successful ongoing and new institutional initiatives designed to address issues related to cultural diversity within the campus and the broader community, and how their efficacy is measured . Although not structured this way in the institutions' reports, this portion of the USM report will identify the institutions' most successful ongoing and new initiatives by their placement in the aforementioned Toward Racial Equity and Justice Framework of Equity and Climate in the USM, Education and Research at the USM , and Service Mission at the USM. Across the USM, 75 initiatives were described. The number of programs described by schools ranged from three to thirteen and were described within a one -page maximum. In all cases, the work described represents only a small fraction of the initiatives undertaken at each institution. Of the 75 programs, 69% can be classified as having a focus on Equity and Climate, 16% - Education and Research, and 12% - Service Mission. Several initiatives have elements of more than one category, but the vast majority are programs that center on how members of the schools' communities are treated, access and opportunities are given, support is offered, barriers are removed, knowledge i s imparted, and climates are established and maintained to create a campus that is as supportive as possible. Equity and Climate in the USM Coppin State University Professional Development for Faculty & Staff Trainings given for University Search Committees on the Dos and Don'ts of the interview process which included inclusiveness and unbiased criteria for candidate selection. Office of Human Resources services provide counseling, support, and a safe space to help employees manage problems which may include microaggressions, discrimination, and finding their voice. The Office of Human Resources works collaboratively with Humanim, a non -profit organization which allows individuals from marginalized communities who face social and economic challenges to work at the University. SkillSoft, an online learning and development tool for faculty and staff, has numerous DEI offerings easily accessible for training such as Your Role in Workplace Diversity and Understandin g Unconscious Bias . Frostburg State University Create a Campus Environment that Promotes the Valuing of Cultural Diversity: Providing campus- wide cultural and gender diversity programming and activities through the President's Advisory Council on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Frostburg's Center for Student Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and the Office of Gender Equity ; supporting campus student organizations that focus on diversity; and providing for the multicultural quality of the curriculum are important strategies designed to help the University attain its goals. Salisbury University The Provost's Office has worked with a variety of stakeholders on a draft plan to recruit and retain diverse faculty in tenure -track positions. The plan extends from initial position justification, to recruitment, selection and hiring, onboarding, professio nal development and mentoring, preparing for tenure and promotion , and post- tenure growth and success. This project has benefitted from the expertise available through Maryland's AGEP Promise Academy Alliance, which is a NSF-funded program to develop, implement, self -study, evaluate, and disseminate a state system model to transform the hiring practices and career success of tenure track historically underrepresented minority faculty in biomedical sciences. Salisbury University ; Towson University ; University of Maryland, Baltimore ; University of Maryland, Baltimore County ; and University of Maryland, College Park are currently members of that partnership. University of Maryland, Baltimore County Office of Academic Opportunity Programs (AOP): Provides resources and support to students who are traditionally underrepresented such as: Educational Talent Search (provides exposure to postsecondary education options to low-income, first- gen middle and high school students in Baltimore County) and Upward Bound (promotes enhancement of student skills in Baltimore City and County schools through academic and cultural enrichment including emphasis on STEM). AOP also houses the McNair's Scholars Program, the Louis Stokes Alliances for 329 Page 5 of 11 Minority Participa tion, the First Generation Network, U -RISE (increases representation in Ph.D. programs and research careers in the biomedical sciences), and the Meyerhoff Scholars Program (nationally recognized for its success in increasing representation in science and e ngineering). University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Living Marine Resources Cooperative Science Center (LMRCSC): UMCES's Institute of Marine and Environmental Technology (IMET ) supports 3-4 graduate fellows per year, for up to three years each, using funds from the NOAA- supported LMRCSC. The LMRCSC aims to train the next generation of marine scientists from underrepresented communities. Current LMRCSC graduate fellows are working with mentors at IMET and the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory . University of Maryland Global Campus The Diversity and Equity Office launched the Inclusion Networks program , which is UMGC's version of an Employee Resource or Affinity Group that is based on race, gender, and gender identity and orientation with a mission to create and cultivate a culture where everyone feels welcome to bring their full selves. These networks throughout the university are grassroots groups led by staff and supported by the Diversity and Equity Office with resources and guidance. The networks allow staff across the university to take ownership of diversity programs that are geared towards their constituent members. The Networks have become a valuable resource for providing feedback to leadership and building community. Education and Research at the USM Towson University Towson launched a series of directed discussion groups linked with some of the many useful books, podcasts, and other readings tied to critically examining whiteness, systemic racism, and engaging with anti -racism. University of Baltimore Academically -centered activities include the addition of a new history course, Black Europe, that will meet one of UBalt's Global and Diverse Perspectives graduation requirement s. This course recontextualizes European history to include the stories of persons of color, who have largely been ignored in historical narratives. University of Maryland, College Park UMD has joined the national organization of Universities Studying Slavery, housed at the University of Virginia . UMD's chapter is titled The 1856 Project to coincide with the founding year of the institution. While still in formation, 1856 is poised to become an important contributor to the full understanding of the ways in which slavery, segregation, and activism have impacte d UMD since its very beginnings. A diversity of initiatives such as a digital historical database of the campus and community as well as courses in history and archeology have been proposed . Service Mission at the USM Bowie State University Due to the social injustice and social unrest from the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services successfully launched the Breathing While Black Series: Know Your Rights for the BSU community. The series provides legal rights and best practices when interacting with the police. Between July 2020 and October 2020, 54 students, faculty, and staff have attended the Breathing While Black Series: Know Your Rights informational sessions. University of Marylan d, Baltimore UMB CURE (Continuing Umbrella of Research Experiences Program) Scholars, launched in fall 2015, is a comprehensive science pipeline initiative that excites students from three middle schools in the underserved neighborhoods of West Baltimore about science and exposes them to careers in health care, cancer research, and STEM. UMB CURE differs from the National Cancer Institute's CURE Program, from which it was modeled and originally funded, by engaging students early in their academic careers (beginning in 6 th grade) through college. UMB CURE has an annual student retention rate of over 92%, a weekly after -school attendance rate over 85%, and a Saturday attendance rate of 78%. The program improved standardized math scores for 80% of the participa nts. 330 Page 6 of 11 University of Maryland Eastern Shore Men of Color in Educatio n started in early 2020 and focuses on the development of Black male teachers in K- 12 Education. Through three components: the Man the Shore Network , the University Cohort , and the High School Teacher University , this program is committed to using UMES as a powerful vehicle for increasing cultural diversity in the Delmarva and greater Maryland teaching labor force. Efficacy is measured by student participation numbers, completers, and by community school engagement numbers. Section 3 Discuss the ways in which the institution anticipates COVID -19 most affecting - either negatively or positively - efforts to enhance diversity on campus. USM institutions, and all colleges and universities across the nation and world, have been changed by COVID in a number of ways. While most consequences have affected all students, faculty, and staff, MHEC inquired about the effects of COVID on institutions' efforts to enhance diversity. Several USM institutions mentioned the two topics that have probably gotten the most attention by the Board of Regents - enrollment and economic impact . Some, not all, USM institutions experienced enrollment declines that can be trac ed to changes in plans for high school graduates and would -be community college transfers as well as students needing to stop out due to increased familial demands and/or the need to work (for the first time) or work more hours . The latter, of course, ties back to the economic impact of COVID. These issues and those that follow have disproportionately affected underrepresented minority faculty, staff, and students and students from rural areas and low -income homes. Other effects, or anticipated effects, include: Differing levels of academic and social readiness of students coming into the universities. Mental health concerns for students, faculty, and staff who are feeling depressed, isolated, anxious, stressed, and lonely. Mental health concerns compounded by em otional distress that has been amplified for Black, multiracial , Asian, and Asian American community members due to the murders and attacks of countless members of those communities and subsequent racial/social unrest. Lack of devices on which to engage virtually . Nonexistent or inadequate access to reliable broadband, which made remote education extremely complicated, if not impossible. Challenges with disabled students receiving accommodations especially if they had never been identified or registered wi th disability support services before being forced into remote learning. Cancellation of summer bridge programs and some recruitment efforts geared toward underrepresented minority students. USM institutions were thoughtful and creative when trying to deal with these issues. From tapping into and creating partnerships with the Kirwan Center for Academic Innovation and Comcast; using CARES funding to purchase devices and provide emergency funds to students; increasing tele- counseling and group therapy opportunities within the counseling centers; establishing new, virtual DEI initiatives (with many focusing on the aftermath social and racial justice activism); and more, faculty, staff, and studen ts did the best they could to adjust and to be able to extend and utilize schools' offerings. Despite the challenges noted above and, certainly, more that exist, there have been some highlights. There has been attention to \"Z oom fatigue \", and while it is real, being in a virtual environment has significantly opened access to a number of programs. For most USM schools, there has been a noticeable increase in student, faculty, and staff participation in diversity -related programs and trainings - notably among many who had not previously been engaged in these efforts . Also, whereas cancelled recruitment programs caused problems for some, a few schools were able to extend virtual interviews to students who normally would have been challenged to travel for in-person interviews . They also established new recruitment c onnections with institutions (including many HBCUs). This greatly benefited students of color and students from low -income families. Ultimately, virtual events (admissions, interviews, speaker series, class sessions, etc.) allowed for more participation (fewer barriers and scheduling conflicts; ability to reach 331 Page 7 of 11 to community members abroad and in distant states) and more access to diverse speakers ( international folks in many cases). The online environment also pushed many faculty members to improve the extent to which they provided culturally competent advising and teaching due to their heightened awareness of students' life circumstances. Being on line helped faculty better understand how socioeconomic status can affect a student's ability to be successful and how the faculty member can assist or otherwise provide consideration to students in challenging circumstances. So, while online learning has been difficult for many , improved professor- student connections and professors taking the time to upskill have been highlights. Some COVID- related accommodations will be unnecessary one day. However, institutions note that being pushed to think quickly and creatively to address many of these problems has led to unique solutions, which can and should remain in place even after the public health emergency ceases to exist. Section 4 See institutions' reports for appendix containing the most recent cultural diversity plan. Section 5 USM Addendum: Describe your institution's top two or three areas of growth and/or challenge as it pertains to diversity, equity, inclusion, and/or combating structural racism. In order to continue informing the environmental scan being conducted by USMO staff, we used this opportunity to ask institutions to share two or three areas of growth or challenge as it pertains to the ir DEI/anti- racism /dismantling structural racism efforts. Understanding the institutions' focuses, challenges, and how they are overcoming challenges can inform the recommendations and goals identified by the USM. Bowie State University Growth: One focus and area of growth is b uilding out and supporting the Social Justice Alliance which is dedicated to using evidence- based social justice models to eradicate the ideology of intolerance, while confronting individuals and combating systems that normalize indifference, justify injus tice, perpetuate hate , and inflict violence. The Social Justice Alliance provides learning opportunities for BSU and UMD students coupled with the local community by infusing social justice education in the curriculum and experiential activities. The Allia nce is committed to inspiring, educating and empowering individuals toward ensuring social justice and equity for all. Through this Alliance, the legacy, light and spirit of Lt. Richard Collins, III will forever guide the mission of social justice. Coppin State University Challenge: Enrollment declines are attributable to two overarching factors - a lack of residential housing and the financial status of many students . For five years, h ousing demands have exceeded space capacity within the two residence halls . Annually, approximately 175 students, especially freshmen and transfers, many of whom are also out-of-state and desire to live on campus, are impacted negatively , as housing is not available. Regarding financ es, over 89% of CSU students are recipients of Federal Student Aid, 58% are Pell recipients , and 70% of the first-time, full-time freshmen are recipients of Pell awards. Often , aid packages are limited due to parents' inability to provide financial information to supplement aid with Parent Plus loans . Together, these housing and financial status concerns impact the number of potential graduates and wage earners who may complete at Coppin and remain in the area to serve the City of Baltimore and surrounding region, filling critical employment needs of Maryland. Frostburg State University Challenge: Increasing the diversity of faculty and staff to more closely reflect the student body continues to be a challenge for Frostburg State University. The isolated, geographic, and rural location of the University has always presented a challenge. The University Council on Diversity, Equity , and Inclusion will work in collaboration with the Offices of Human Resources and the Provost to continue to identify strategies to address this challenge. 332 Page 8 of 11 Growth: The new Assistant Vice President (AVP) for Student Affairs , also serving as the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer (DEIO) , is the senior diversity and inclusion advisor to university leadership. The DEIO provides strategic and programmatic leadership with measurable success metrics as part of meaningful and ongoing institutional effectiveness, for diversity and inclusion initiatives. These initiatives will advance diversity as a critical component of social, academic , and intellectual life. The DEIO works across the academy, but with a particular emphasis on people of color related to recruitment, retention, and institutional equity. Salisbury University Growth: SU is seeing growth around working more coh esively to address the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minority employees. All divisions are actively working with the Chief Diversity Officer to embed promising diversity practices regarding this effort . Growth: SU is seeing growth in efforts to increase awareness around topics of diversity, equity , and inclusion. Academic departments have created diversity committees to address increasing education and awareness through various efforts. The Psychology departments at Salisbury Universit y and India's Pandit Deendayal Petroleum University collaborated on a course centered on discussion of the book Caste: The Origin of our Discontents (Wilkerson) . The opening and closing sessions were open to the public. Additionally, successful anti -racism summits and challenges as well as book studies have also taken place. Challenge: Student engagement in voluntary diversity education and programming. Towson University Growth: In the past year , TU has implemented a plan to increase diverse hires, starting with the education of every faculty search committee to address bias and equity. The collaboration of the Provost Office and Office of Inclusion & Institutional Equity (OIIE) has led to over 500 faculty receiving training on equitable searches. Additionally, the Provost Office and OIIE began the Inclusive Advocates (IAs) projects. IAs are tenured faculty and permanent status librarians who are trained as search and selection process advisors and are consistently on the cutting edge of effective advocacy of de -biasing the search process. A designated Inclusion Advocate sits on tenured, tenure track faculty, and permanent librarian search committees. Challenge: During a time of crisis, the university provided programs, lectures , and interactive spaces for students, faculty, and staff to process the issues of anti- racism, anti -blackness, white fragility, and bias. TU provided trainings, book groups, and counseling spaces and requested trainings to all members and identities in the community. The demand required a quick response and campus- wide support to address the needs of the community. Growth: The continued work around the Total Tiger Program provides education and training that sup ports the mission of TU, to become a more inclusive and equitable institution, with an emphasis on anti -racism, social justice , and inclusive excellence. Also, TU received the NCAA and Minority Opportunities Athletic Association (MOAA) Award for Diversity and Inclusion Award Committee (NCAA/MOAA). The award signified the universities work and partnerships to honor diversity and inclusion in intercollegiate athletics and the broader campus community. University of Baltimore Growth: All University of Baltim ore schools have curricular and co -curricular initiatives that support cultural diversity, including efforts aimed at addressing the needs and interests of minorities traditionally underrepresented in higher education. The academic units offer co -curricular programming and encourage classroom discussion on topics relevant to structural racism. Examples include: UBalt Law in Focus Series topics The School- to-Prison Pipeline: Understanding its Impact and the Need for Change and Structural Racism and Transportation Policy: The Road Ahead; The College of Public Affairs was approved to offer a full bachelor's degree at the Jessup Correctional Institution; and the Yale Gordon College of Arts and Sciences and the School of Law's new co urses that address structural racism (Black Europe and Critical Race Theory ). 333 Page 9 of 11 Challenge: Students have concerns about a broad range of DEI -related topics. Student Government -led initiatives often appeal to meeting the social justice and advocacy desires of the student body. Other student needs range from individual case -by-case concerns about microaggressions to concerns about c onduct. Student relations matters and concerns of the Student Government Association continue to be handled directly by the Office of Student Support. When necessary, important trends or urgent matters of DEI concern to students are also shared with the University's leadership. University of Maryland, Baltimore Challenge: 1) Creating inclusive environments where students, faculty, and staff can be successful and 2) increasing the cultural knowledge, awareness, and skills of students, faculty, and staff to positively influence the campus climate and improve the human condition and public good. This includes increasing the awareness of current social justice issues. The opening of the inaugural Intercultural Center provides an environment for student s to feel valued and recognized and also co -curricular experiences, trainings, and programs that advance diversity, equity, and inclusion learning outcomes of students, faculty, and staff. Growth: To be true to its mission, UMB has to address issues of st ructural racism and inequality directly through educational programs, community engagement work, and academic pursuits. The basis of UMB's strategy is to encourage all campus voices to be heard and valued to improve DEI outcomes. On the path to being an an ti-racist organization, the inaugural chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer and vice president will play a key role in creating transformative positive change at UMB through the advancement of strategic priorities, establishment of new initiatives , and facilitating meaningful collaboration and synergy across the University. University of Maryland, Baltimore County Challenge: Maintaining dedication to cultural and ethnic diversity, social responsibility , and lifelong learning while also being commi tted to disrupting structural racism in order to create an equitable learning environment for all. UMBC recognizes the following areas that are opportunities to combat systemic barriers : - Talking about racial justice: UMBC has worked to institutionalize efforts to discuss and address racial injustice via town halls and new work on Retriever Rise , a campaign to increase the visibility of the racial justice work being led by the Office of Equity and Inclusion and the Inclusion Council. - Enacting antiracist policies and providing resources: an effort is underway to create comprehensive antiracist polic ies and resources including generating scholarly research, educational tools, and policy analysis geared towards dismant ling racism. - Engaging the community in restorative practices: UMBC is working to elevate the work being done already at UMBC around restorative practices including efforts in residence life, student conduct, and the Office of Equity and Inclusion. Campu s stakeholders are working to incorporate restorative practices into curriculum, policy, and procedures across campus. University of Maryland, College Park Challenge: Although UMD is fortunate to have seen increased growth in the diverse student body, the expectations and needs of those diverse students challenge some of the traditional and accepted approaches to higher education. The University is working hard to meet those needs by ensuring that the campus environment is one of inclusion as demonstrated through all aspects of campus life, particularly the curriculum. Challenge: As the university implement s new general education diversity requirements , there is a need for more courses as well as instructors who are capable of of fering them. Those instructors will need training to address complex issues , support as they become sought -after on the topics at hand, and reward s for their knowledge and abilities in a high -demand area. This also applies to staff who offer workshops and advise student activists who seek to move theory to practice. To address this, UMD is discussing a \"Facilitation Academy\" connected to the TerrapinSTRONG initiative that would provide opportunities for instructors to develop and hone classroom skills. 334 Page 10 of 11 Growth: FAMILE is a diversity initiative aimed at increasing the number of underrepresented tenured or tenure - track faculty at the university. The goal is to add over 100 new tenured or tenure- track faculty in departments and units across campus based on demonstrated diversity objectives . The initiative has already begun to contribute to faculty diversity and the ongoing success of FAMILE and related work will help UMD see additional increases in that area. University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Challenge: The majority of the racial diversity at UMCES is currently in staff positions. UMCES is actively discussing faculty diversity and recruitment of students from underrepresented groups in the geosciences and strives to bring faculty and student diversity up to the level of the diversity of the staff . Challenge: UMCES is actively making progress toward increased inclusion and equity for everyone, regardless of their position at the institution. Staff, in particular , have sometimes been left out of previous discussions, but have been some of the most enthusiastic participants in recent UMCES DEI efforts. UMCES is consciously and vigorously enhancing efforts to improve the lived experience of all UMCES employees, especially staff, and actively working to reveal and reduce the microagg ressions found in so many institutions of higher education. Growth: UMCES now has both centralized and dispersed active DEI -related committees and collaboratives to allow all voices to have a platform to be heard. They have also ensured that shared governance groups continue to discuss diversity and inclusion as a line -item agenda topic at all meetings. A dditionally, UMCES is developing both outward and inward- facing DEI mission, goals, and conduct and policy statements to better reflect the school's values. University of Maryland Eastern Shore Growth: UMES is engaging in a comprehensive institutional self -study focused on institutional diversity and inclusion in developing students who will go on to become STEM professors and researchers. UMES is examining the factors in its history, traditions, and practices that support and impede diversity and inclusion within its culture. Challenge: Building institutional infrastructure for students with disabilities - UMES continues to work across units to create the necessary educational infrastructures for serving students with disabilities. These efforts are continuous and include: expanding the services of the Office of Institutional Equity (tutoring, learning accommodations, counseling); creating more faculty development opportunities in order to help instructors learn their o bligations to students with disabilities and important pedagogical strategies to help all students learn, whether or not they are identified as disabled; creating awareness discussions and campaigns about various pedagogical and research developments ; and working with student clubs and athletics to make and sustain opportunities for all students' participation and development. University of Maryland Global Campus Growth: As the social and racial justice movements were taking place across the globe, UMGC 's Diversity and Equity Office developed the Diversity Dialogue Series aimed at providing a safe place for people to share what was in their hearts and to lean on one another. These conversations are ongoing and will continue to be a part of the fabric of UMGC's people, culture, and diversity efforts. The launch of UMGC's Inclusion Networks further strengthened the ability to ensure that staff and faculty were actively engaged in the development, delivery, and execution of programs designed to meet the needs of the cultural identity groups that are part of the university. Challenge: UMGC is constantly looking to ensure that the complexity of online systems do not leave students with disabilities behind and that their experiences are considered. The University is looking to expand disability support services that come from the Accessibility Services Unit to address this and related challenges. Challenge: It is more important than ever that UMGC faculty have the skills and tools to interact effectively with the diverse UMGC student body. The goal is to not only ensure that the UMGC curriculum is culturally appropriate, but to also develop curriculum for faculty that is focused on anti-racist pedagogy and gives them the resources to create a classroom environment that is open, inviting, and inclusive. 335 Page 11 of 11 Conclusion This year's report consists of information gathered from prompts that are relevant for the time in which we are operating as opposed to the sections and categories that have been central to the report from its inception. The reports include campuses' definitions of diversity ; select institutional DEI initiatives ; explanations of COVID- 19's effects on efforts to enhance diversity; and USM's request for areas of growth and/or challenge as it pertains to diversity, equity, inclusion, and/or combating structural racism. The efforts and initiatives described in this report highlight work that is being done at the campus level , which depends upon involvement from a wide variety of administrative units and academic schools, colleges, and departments, as well as community members. Work within and across divisions is important, occurring, and will hopefull y become more systemic. Institutions also note inter - institutional work and important partnerships within their communities, which is promising. We have learned that institutions: define diversity broadly, going beyond race and quantitative measures ; are intently focused on inclusion and climate issues; recognize that preexisting challenges were made more evident by COVID; have been addressing new concerns that have arise n due to COVID, and while many affect the entire campus, the negative e ffects often disproportion ately affect underrepresented minorities and students from low -income families; and are challenged by the need to increase the diversity of faculty and staff on campus, improv e the climate, dismant le barriers, and enhance DEI discussions and engagement. Since the 2020 release of the Toward Racial Equity and Social Justice framework, USMO has been assessing work at the institutions and the USM Office to understand USM's role in perpetuating structural racism and how we can begin or enhance work to establish and promot e anti-racist policies and actions and dismant le structural racism. Presently, an environmental scan is underway to obtain a clear understanding of where there are gaps and opportunities for growth and focus as it pertains to student success; college affordability and financial literacy; diversity, compensation, mentoring, and training among faculty, staff, and leadership; curricular and co -curricular foci on DEI and dismantling structural racism; and beyond. This began last summer, is still underway, and, now, is being carefully considered alongside the DEI findings that emerge d from stakeholder focus groups conducted for the USM strategic planning process. Chancellor Jay Perman recently shared with the USM Office staff that diversity, equity, inclusion, and racial and social justice are efforts that nearly all stakeholders said we need to strengthen as we enter a new strategic plan cycle. Indeed, these are areas that should be i ntegrated and prioritize d throughout the strategic plan, and those ideals must be essential to who we are and what we do. The Committee on Education Policy and Student Life will be kept apprised as findings and recommendations emerge. Institutions are appropriately tackling inclusion and diversity from multiple perspectives. This work will continue, as there is no quick or singular fix . USM colleges and universities cite the need for additional resources to most effectively implement or sustain some of their initiatives . In the meantime, they find ways to make progress on this important work . All have identified a number of areas for continuous improvement and/or programs they are continuing to support , as it often takes years for the outcomes of these activities and strategies to be realized. The USM staff will continue to work with the institutions on their compliance with the statut e guiding this report, with determining the best ways to bring this information to the Board of Regents , and, most importantly, with conducting the work needed to make USM institutions among the most representative, welcoming, equitable, social justice - focused communities of higher education in the United States. Enclosures: USM Institutional Cultural Diversity Progress Reports 336 BOWI E STATE UNIVERSITY 337 Spring 2021 INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAMS OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY ANNUAL PROGRESS REPORT Institution: Bowie State University Date Submitted : April 12, 2021 Point(s) of Contact (names and email addresses) : Adonna Green, Director of Equity Compliance , agreen@bowiestate.edu Gayle Fink, Assistant Vice President for Institutional Effectiveness, gfink@bowiestate.edu Keadrick Peters, Coordinator of Multicultural Programs, kpeters@bowiestate.edu Purpose of Report: The Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Annual Progress Report is mandated by \u00a711 -406 of the Education Article, which states that each public institution of higher education shall submit a progress report regarding the institution's implementation of a plan for a program of cultural diversity. Section I - Institutional Definition of Diversity Bowie State University has a long -standing commitment to diversity; it values and celebrates diversity in all of its forms. The University community believ es that its educational environment is enriched by the diversity of individuals, groups, and cultures that come together in a spirit of learning. As the University aspires to even greater racial diversity, it fully embraces the global definition of divers ity that acknowledges and recognizes differences and advances knowledge about race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, political persuasion, culture, sexual orientation, religion, age, and disability. The University's FY 2019 - FY 2024 Racing to Excellence Strategic Plan provides the framework for diversity and inclusion efforts. The student, faculty, staff, administrators and alumni members of the Strategic Planning Committee, revised the core values and strategic goals after completing a SWO T analysis and reviewing peer institution plans. The committee recommended revising the previous core value of diversity to inclusivity to more accurately reflect the current focus of the institution. The inclusivity core value is below: Core Value of Inclusivity - Bowie State University is intentional about creating a community that encourages involvement, respect, and connection among students, faculty, staff, and administrators regardless of differences of race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, culture, sexual orientation, religion, age, and disability. The FY 2019- 2024 Strategic Plan provides further direction to enhance this core value. Goal 4 - Enhancing our Campus Culture of Diversity, Inclusion and Civic Engagement outlines objectives to further enhance the University's efforts to e mbrace, promote, and support a community of cultural inclusivity, diversity , and accountability by ensuring that faculty, staff, and students develop a mindset of accountability in teaching, learning, support programs, and extra -curricular campus experienc es designed to enhance collaboration and engagement. Objectives : 4.1 Community of inclusion - Sustain our commitment to fostering and supporting a safe, civil and welcoming environment for students, faculty, and staff by being intentional about how our community encourages involvement, respect, and connection among its members (State Plan: Success, Strategy 4). 3384.2 Cult urally responsive pedagogies - Expand the use of culturally responsive pedagogies through faculty development (State Plan: Success, Strategy 5, 6). 4.3 Multicultural programs and services - Establish an Office of Multicultural Programs and Services that promotes an appreciation of inclusion and diversity on campus and assists with the retention and graduation of international students. 4.4 Culture of historical richness - Cultivate a culture of historical richness through campus displays and events that celebrate historical significant events and outcomes. 4.5 Civic responsibility - Continue to educate the next generation of global citizen s to build stronger, more engaged communities through coordinated and deliberate activities aimed at improving the quality of life in our community and strengthening our democracy through political and nonpolitical engagement. Strategic Plan Key Performance Indicators provide data related to student and staff demographics, countries of origin , and student success by student subgroups to evaluate progress and inform future activities. Even in these ever changing times, Bowie State University remains committed to diversity in all its forms. Section II - Successful Cultural Diversity Initiatives Even during the predominately virtual environment of the past year, Bowie facilitated 15 cultural diversity programs in which over 630 faculty, staff and students attended. Below are examples of successful ongoing and new institutional initiatives designed to address issues related to cultural diversity. BSU Safe Space Program -ONGOING Since November 2019, the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services facilitates a two -part professional workshop for faculty, staff, students, and local community members that cultivate s a more inclusive campus for our LGBT + community. To receive the safe space program certificate and safe space sticker, participants must attend both parts of the workshops. Safe Space training is an opportunity to learn about: LGBT+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and related communities) identities, gender, sexuality, prejudice, assumptions, and privilege. As a result of COVID- 19, the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services revised the Safe Space program to deliver the training virtually in spring 2020. In the summer of 2020, the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services collaborated with the Office of Residence Life and the Office of Student Activities to expand the Safe Space program to include student leaders interested in fostering a more welcoming campus for the LGBT community. As of March 10, 2021, 76 faculty, staff, and students are Safe Space certified. BSU Inaugural Latino Academic and Leadership End- of-Year Award Luncheon- ONGOING The Latino Academic and Leadership End- of-Year Award Luncheon is an opportunity for the BSU community to honor the contributions of students, staff, and faculty making an impact on campus. The event recognizes, celebrates, and affirms students who excel in academics and leadership on campus. All full -time s tudents who self-identify as Latino or Hispanic origin earning a 3.2 GPA or better in the fall semester, as well as those who have been active with leadership roles on campus are invited to participate. The inaugural event in 2020 recognized the Raices student organization leadership team (Latino affinity student group) and members of the charter sorority of Sigma Lambda Gamma, the first Latina sorority at BSU and one of the first at a Maryland historically black college or university (HBCU). In April 2020, the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services in partnership with the Office of Institutional Advancement recognized 85 self-identified Latino students for academic and leadership on campus during the 2019- 2020 academic year. Unfortunately the program was cancelled due to the pandemic restrictions. On April 29, 2021, the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services in partnership with the Office of Institutional Advancement will host the first Latino Academic Excellence and Leadership ceremony virtually to 339recog nize self -identified Latino students. Equally important, unlike the inaugural year, this year, all self - identified Latino undergraduate May graduates will be honored at the annual event. Breathing While Black Series: Know Your Rights- NEW Due to the social injustice and social unrest from the death of George Floyd in May 2020, the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services successfully launched Breathing While Black Series for the BSU community. The Breathing While Black Series: Know Your Rights provides legal rights and best practices wh en interacting with the police. Between July 2020 and October 2020, 54 students, faculty, and staff have attended the Breathing While Black Series: Know Your Rights informational sessions. The Breathing While Black Series is available upon request on the M PS webpage. BSU Inaugural Hispanic Heritage Month Virtual Address- NEW In an effort to augment awareness for Hispanic Heritage Month (September 15- October 15), the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services in partnership with Raices (Latino affinity student club) and SLG (student multiracial sorority), successfully hosted the Inaugural Hispanic Heritage Month Virtual Address on September 17, 2020 with 35 students, faculty, and staff in attendance. Maryland State Delegate Averio was the keynote who addressed the importance of Hispanic Heritage Month, diversity celebrations all year, and the value of speaker holding elected officials accountable regarding social injustice. In April 2021, the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services will convene a H ispanic Heritage Month committee that will outline BSU's first Hispanic Heritage Month activites slated for 2021. BSU Inaugural Courageous Conversations Book & Movie Discussion Series- NEW In observance of CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Day of Unde rstanding in April 2021, the Office of Equity Compliance and the Office of Multicultural Programs & Services will host a virtual book and movie discussion on New York Times bestseller Ta -Nehisi Coates's \"Between the World and Me.\" Bowie faculty, staff, and students are encouraged to read the book or watch the HBO Max movie based on the book. The Day of Understanding is an initiative of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, the largest CEO -driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusio n within the workplace. Bowie State University joined this collective in 2017. About Voices & Viewpoints: Diversity Discussions Through Media - NEW The bi -monthly book and movie series, hosted by BSU Office of Equity Compliance and the Office of Multicultu ral Programs & Services, offers opportunities for the BSU community to discuss books and films representing experiences of various cultures, groups, and identities in entertaining and informative ways. All events will be hosted virtually until further notice. Section III - Anticipated Impact of Pandemic on Cultural Diversity Although programs and services focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion have been available monthly since March 2020, attendance has decreased significantly among students, faculty, and staff. Al though virtual fatigue has negatively affected programs and services, the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services intentionally collaborated with different campus offices and student organizations to capture a larger attendance and boos t audience. Equally important, the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services implemented a number of DEI Awareness mobile stations for over 800 residential students on campus. The DEI Awareness mobile station provided residential students with opportunities to stay engaged on different diversity cultural theme months. For example, the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services successfully hosted Academics and Social Identity DEI mobile station in late January 2021. Over 50 residential students parti cipated in the DEI mobile station and noted the in -person platform convinced them to participate in the program. 340Appendix A Bowie State University Cultural Diversity Plan - Update Bowie State University is currently revising its approach to cultural diversity and inclusion to align with the goals and objectives in its Racing to Excellence FY 2019 - FY 2024 Strategic Plan . Goal 4 of the Strategic Plan specifically focuses on enhancing the campus culture of diversity, inclusion and civic engagement. Strategic Plan Goal 4 objectives are listed below. Goal 4 - Enhancing our Campus Culture of Diversity, Inclusion and Civic Engagement Bowie State University will embrace, promote, and support a community of cultural inclusivity, diversity and accountability by ensuring that faculty, staff and students develop a mindset of accountability in teaching, learning, support programs, and extra -curricular campus experiences designed to enhance collaboration and engagement. Objectives 4.1 Community of inclusion - Sustain our commitment to fostering and supporting a safe, civil and welcoming environment for students, faculty, and staff by being intentional about how our community encourages invol vement, respect, and connection among its members (State Plan: Success, Strategy 4). 4.2 Culturally responsive pedagogies - Expand the use of culturally responsive pedagogies through faculty development (State Plan: Success, Strategy 5, 6). 4.3 Multicult ural programs and services - Establish an Office of Multicultural Programs and Services that promotes an appreciation of inclusion and diversity on campus and assists with the retention and graduation of international students. 4.4 Culture of historical richness - Cultivate a culture of historical richness through campus displays and events that celebrate historical significant events and outcomes. 4.5 Civic responsibility - Continue to educate the next generation of global citizens to build stronger, more engaged communities through coordinated and deliberate activities aimed at improving the quality of life in our community and strengthening our democracy through political and nonpolitical engagement. In addition, the Strategic Plan articulates the core v alues of the University: Excellence, Inclusivity, Integrity, Accountability, and Innovation. Our core value of Inclusivity is defined as \"intentional about creating a community that encourages involvement, respect, and connection among students, faculty, staff, and administrators regardless of differences of race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, culture, sexual orientation, religion, age, and disability.\" As an HB CU, the Bowie State community believed it was important to adopt a definition that went b eyond race and ethnicity to include the numerous other characteristics that bring richness to our campus community. In the past, the University took a decentralized approach to support cultural diversity. Annual objectives relating to cultural diversit y flow through the offices of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs, 341the Exec utive Vice President and General Counsel, the Vice President of Administration and Finance and the Vice President for Student Affairs. Building upon the previous work of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee, President Breaux, in FY 2019, engaged in numerous discussions with campus constituencies related to the structure of diversity and inclusion activities on campus. A multi -phase proposal for a diversity and incl usion unit, an expansion on the work of the Office of Equity Compliance, is in draft form with initial funding planned for FY 2021. In anticipation of the Diversity and Inclusion unit, the Center for Academic Programs Assessment (CAPA) began collect ing base- line student data on intercultural competency and diversity to inform the work of the Diversity and Inclusion Committee by participating in the Educational Testing Service (ETS) HEIghten pilot study. The ETS HEIghten study defined intercultural competency and diversity (ICD) as a \"person's capability to gather, interpret, and act upon radically different cues and function effectively in multicultural situations. Over 200 academic officers at community colleges and four -year institutions participated in the pilot study. Multiple pilot forms were designed for the ICD assessment. Each ICD form had 80 items and was designed to be less than 40- minutes long. Areas assessed included: Analyze and Act : The ability to take in, evaluate and synthesize relevant information without the bias of preconceived judgments and to translate thoughts into actions. Approach : The overall positivity with which an individual views and responds to cross-cultural interactions. Positive Cultural Orientation : The evaluation of cr oss-cultural situations as favorable. Cultural Self -Efficacy: The belief that one can successfully engage in cross- cultural situations. Suspending Judgment/Perspective Taking : Active consideration of others' potential viewpoints and active refrainment of preconceived cultural schema interfering with informed processing. Social Monitoring : Awareness of physical, verbal and nonverbal behaviors and cues of others during a social interaction; attention to others' responses to one's own actions and signals. Baseline data from HEIghten indicated that BSU freshmen students were very close to the proficient level in \"Analyze and Act\" in \"Approach\". BSU students were within .5 points or less of their national comparison peers in Positive Cultural Orientation and C ultural Self -Efficacy. Suspending Judgment/Perspective Taking and Social Monitoring were the areas where BSU students and the comparison group had the largest gaps with BSU students scoring lower than those students at comparison institutions. Data from seniors were collected in AY 2020 and were analyzed in summer 2020 . Furthermore, t he Office of Equity and Compliance and Facilities Management collaborated on an ADA and Accessibility Survey to improve the design and detail of campus grounds and facilities to meet the needs and expectations of our community members of all abilities. Several opportunities for improvement were identified related to parking and elevator availability and reliability. The finding s supported a FY 2019 grant proposal for facili ties improvements. Additionally, t he core value of Inclusion is measured through the Ruffalo Noel Levitz Student Satisfaction Inventory and the Ruffalo Noel Levitz College Employee Satisfaction Survey. Findings from these and other sources, including a survey conducted by the Office of Multicultural Programs and Services of incoming student' s diversity interests and needs, are used to inform the activity planning for the Diversity and Inclusion unit. 342Bowie State University recognize s that cultural diversity in this context is relegated narrowly to religious, ethnic, and racial minorities, with a focus on creating a comfortable and welcoming environment in spaces where that does not already exist. As a Historically Black University, BSU believe s the unique culture of our campus, its connection to the broader community, and the heritage of which we are apart is beneficial to everyone who attends, educates, or otherwise works for Bowie State University. Accordingly, we will design a plan that welcomes the working and learning opportunities that a diversity of persons, thought, background, and protected characteristics offer within an environment that celebrates and educates all groups in the context of our rich history. In consideration of the multi -faceted approach the University intends to take to improv e and extend its inclusive work across the campus, BSU h as determined that a consultant will be needed to support the institution's efforts in creating a Diversity and Inclusion Strategic Plan. At the time of this reporting the University is completing its vetting and selection process for the consultant. It is anticipated that Phase 1 of a written plan will take approximately six months from the beginning of the contract to complete and that BSU will be able to share a working draft of the plan during the 2022 phase of reporting. 343 COPPIN STATE UNIVERSITY 3441 Coppin State University's Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Report Submitted to the University System of Maryland Board of Regents April 12, 2021 3452 CSU Cultural Diversity Report Submission April 12, 2021 Coppin State University's Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion The diversity of the students, faculty, and staff of Coppin State University has been the source of creativity, student success, and innovative accomplishments throughout the institution's history since it was founded in 1900. Diversity has evolved to be among the defining features of Maryland's past, present, and future in terms of the variety of personal experiences, values, and worldviews that arise from differences of culture and circumstances. Such differences, which are valued at the University include race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, language, abilities and disabilities, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, a nd geographic region. Since the core mission of the Coppin State University, as an urban, Historically Black College/University (HBCU) is to serve the interests of the State of Maryland by producing top graduates with a diversity portfolio of experiences, it must seek to increase and maintain diversity among its students, faculty, and staff. Coppin has always demonstrated a compelling interest in making sure that people from all backgrounds perceive that access to the education and equal opportunity is possible for talented individuals from all groups. The leadership of Coppin State University agrees to the following tenants of diversity: \u00a7 Diversity is integral to the University's achievement of excellence and can enhance the ability of the University to accomplish its academic mission. \u00a7 Diversity aims to broaden and deepen both the educational experience and the scholarly environment, as students and faculty learn to interact effectively with each other, preparing them to participate in an increasingly complex and global society. \u00a7 Ideas, and practices based on those ideas, can be made richer by the process of being born and nurtured in a diverse community. The pluralistic university can model a process of proposing and testing ideas through respectful, civic participation and engagement. \u00a7 Educational excellence that truly incorporates diversity thus can promote mutual respect and make possible the full, effective use of the talents and abilities of all to foster innovation and train future leadership. Through the annual work and contributions of the university's Diversity and Inclusion Committee, Coppin State University renews its commitment to the full realization of its historic promise to recognize and nurture merit, talent, and achievement by supporting diversity and equal opportunity in its education, services, and administration, as well as research and creative activity. The University monitors these results in the programs activities and strategies it supports in order to ensure that diversity and inclusion education and awareness continuously facilitates the removal of barriers to the recruitment, retention, and advancement of talented students, faculty, and staff from historically underrepresented and multigenerational populations. These initiatives are also a part of the University's strategic goals for each academic and non- academic unit. An excerpt from the mission statement (approved in 2019) states that \"Coppin State University, a historically black institution in a dynamic urban setting, serves a multi- generational student population, provides innovative education opportunities, and promotes lifelong learning. The University fosters leadership, social responsibility, civic and community engagement, cultural diversity and inclusion, and economic development.\" 3463 Selected Initiatives Contributing to the Successful Culture of Diversity & Inclusion Several programs, strategies, and initiatives have contributed to a culture of diversity and inclusion at the University. While there is a greater awareness of efforts across the campus and in the community, there is still room for improvement. However, increasing awareness and building on an existing structure is attributable to the following programs: \u00a7 Safe Space Training. This program is conducted by the Counseling Center for Student Development in conjunction with residence life and student activities. A variety of safe spaces are provided where students, faculty, and staff may come together to discuss issues related to diversity and inclusion such as understanding LGBTQIA students and their experiences while contributing to the academy. The residence halls have capacity to hold 600 students annually who have opportunities for participation. \u00a7 Curricular Requirements - Freshman Seminar. Each year, through the one-credit course, freshmen students are afforded several opportunities to get the know the University's climate and how they may become contributors on a variety on academic issues. Diversity and Inclusion are topics that are taught to incoming students who are required to write a reflection paper for academic credit, and then share during in -class lecture sessions. \u00a7 Summer Academic Success Academy (SASA) - The Summer Academic Success Academy is an intensive, six-week campus-based, residential program that prepares students for the transition from high school to college. SASA students receive information on financial literacy, career planning, personal growth, and other campus resources and support services. Ninety-five percent of participants enroll at Coppin each fall contributing to diverse enrollment trends. \u00a7 Professional Development for Faculty & Staff by all units on campus conducted by Human Resources on such topics as Unconscious Bias and other routine workshops held, which are open to the campus community: o Trainings given for University Search Committees on the Do's and Don'ts of the Interview Process which included the inclusiveness and unbiased criteria for candidate selection. o The Office of Human Resources services offered through our EAP, Guidance Resources, provides counseling, support, and a safe space to help employees manage problems which may include microaggressions, discrimination, and finding their voice. o The Office of Human Resources works collaboratively with Humanim, a non-profit organization which allow individuals from marginalized communities who face social and economic challenges to work at the University. o SkillSoft, an online learning and development tool for faculty and staff, has numerous DEI offerings easily accessible for training such as Your Role in Workplace Diversity and Understanding Unconscious Bias. \u00a7 Annual Campus-Wide Events. Several events include the annual Constitution Day, which is used to encourage students to become leaders within the community. The Annual Martin Luther King, Jr. Day is a speaker series and recognition ceremony that is open to the campus and local community. The event recognizes leaders who have made noteworthy contributions to diversity. There are also annual townhalls on Race, Culture, History, and Crime, which provide the campus community with opportunities to participate in lecture series and other activities that promote cultural diversity. 3474 Impacts of COVID-19 on Diversity Initiatives Several initiatives were not held due to the ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic. Although the University was able to successfully conduct several programs in a virtual format, selected programs that impact enrollment, retention, and graduation, were not held. These programs also impact the diversity of the student body and the diverse faculty who regularly participate in the annual summer academy. Additionally, new issues were cited over the virtual delivery of education to our population of students. Selected programs and examples affected by the pandemic are below: \u00a7 The institution managed to support students who indicated through surveys that they needed broadband equipment to support the delivery of virtual courses. Blackboard Collaborate and other platforms were used successfully to deliver education. However, a significant number of students indicated a lack of internet broadband strong enough to continuously support their learning experience. \u00a7 Faculty members with the assistance of the USM Kirwan Center for Academic Innovation were able to receive support for delivering courses in a virtual modality, which included course design as well as support for virtual labs, using Labster. While the University was already making use of the some of these platforms, they were new to most faculty who requested training. \u00a7 Enrollment for the University declined to 2,046 students who were registered for spring 2021. Students were, and many still are, concerned over their financial welfare as many of them became unemployed and had to take on additional caregiving responsibilities as they and loved ones lost jobs and childcare centers closed. As a result, some students have placed education on hold while others have decided to attend community college. \u00a7 Summer Academic Success Academy (SASA) - The Summer Academic Success Academy was not held due to the pandemic. This is a campus-based initiative, which is also a residential cohort program. Typically, the program enrolls 75-100 students, based on institutional resources. Ninety-five percent of participants enroll at Coppin each fall. The pandemic continues to impact this program that provides intervention for some student participants while providing early access towards program completion for others. The program will not be offered again in summer 2021 out of an abundance of safety due to the limitations of the pandemic and infection rate of Baltimore City, where Coppin is centrally located. Not being able to offer the program affects the institution's efforts to provide a diverse, minority group of students with early access to and support for higher education efforts. \u00a7 Safe Space Training - The program conducted by the Counseling Center was unable to secure the physical space normally used to provide in-person training to students, faculty, and staff and to transfer knowledge, awareness, appreciation, and understanding of LGBTQIA student issues. Plans are in progress to provide programming fall 2021. \u00a7 LatinX Programming - The University initiated programming to recognize Hispanic Heritage and has recently formed a group to discuss supporting increasing numbers of LatinX students on the campus. Although COVID-19 impacted overall campus life, two events were held, one virtually and another in-person but was socially-distanced. 3485 Appendix - CSU Diversity Implementation Plan I. Implementation Plan and Strategy for Meeting Goals Timeline: 2020-2025 Draft Under Review Coppin State University's Cultural Diversity and Inclusion Plan is a living document that currently aligns to the institution's strategic priorities, which in clude increasing enrollment and enhancing the student experience. The plan will be revised to coincide with the University's strategic plan, which is projected to undergo revisions beginning summer 202 1. Each year, the academic and administrative units provide an update related to the institution's priorities, which align to the diversity and inclusion goals of the institution. University strategic goals related that support diversity and inclusion are aligned to and include the foll owing: \u00a7 CSU Strategic Priority - Increase Enrollment - Recruit, enroll, and retain, high school students, working adults, and transfer students who are seeking a degree or certification for career advancement or economic gain. Aligned CSU Diversity Plan Goal 1: Increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups among students, administrative staff, and faculty. \u00a7 CSU Strategic Priority - Student Experience - Address the needs of our multigenerational student population by creating an environment that supports diversity, equity, and inclusion through learning outcomes inside and outside the classroom. Aligned CSU Diversity Plan Goal 2: Create Positive Interactions and cultural awareness among students, faculty, and staff on campus. Measures and Projected Outcomes for Enrollment The institution will examine a variety of measures related to increasing diversity and inclusion. As it relates to enrollment, retention, and graduation, plans are in progress to increase all the rates. Success has been realized as Coppin has maintained a strong 2-year retention rate and has increased its 6-year graduation rate significantly by six percentage point. Clearly, the impact of selected programs is having positive impacts on student success.

Description of How the Institution Addresses Cultural Diversity among Students, Faculty, and Staff Populations CSU achieves and supports cultural diversity through strategic programming related to the inclusion of those racial and ethnic groups and individuals that are or have been underrepresented in higher education. Also, the University is inclusive of persons regardless of race, color, religion (creed), gender, gender expression, age, national origin (ancestry), ability or disability, marital status, sexual orientation, and military status. Cultural diversity and inclusion are central to the institution's mission, which \"fosters leadership, social responsibility, civic and community engagement, cultural diversity and inclusion, and economic development. \" Cultural Diversity Among Students CSU is uniquely capable of addressing the preparation of multigenerational students from the State of Maryland, Baltimore City and County, and regions beyond. The University extends its preparations beyond the traditional classroom by providing experiential and authentic learning experiences to students who have been differently prepared. To address the cultural diversity goals of the USM, the university has aligned its plan to help the System and State meet their goals of accomplishing greater diversity and inclusion. Since the 2008-2009 baseline year, the University has experienced a decline in enrollment within all student categories. However, the University has been able to maintain a diverse student population and serve a multigenerational student body. Selected initiatives across the campus within the Student Affairs and Enrollment Management, as well as Academic Affairs have supported the University's efforts to attract and retain a proportional mix of students that reflect the community. However, there is room for continued improvement. The following programs, strategies, and initiatives support enrollment, retention, and graduation, and continue to yield positive results. Selected support programs and interventions include: \u00a7 Summer Academic Success Academy (SASA) - The Summer Academic Success Academy is an intensive, six-week campus-based, residential program that prepares students for the transition from high school to college. At-risk students can develop confidence and earn college credit prior to the start of the fall semester. SASA students receive information on financial literacy, career planning, personal growth, and other campus resources and support services. This program strengthen enrollment. Ninety-five percent of participants enroll at Coppin each fall. The program was not held summer 2020 due to the COVID19 pandemic. It will also not be held summer 2021 for the same reason. \u00a7 First Year Experience (FYE) - The First-Year Experience program serves as the advisement hub and unit that plans and implements co-curricular activities for first-year students. Students receive intrusive advisement and guidance through the completion of the first semester at the University. \u00a7 Academic Success Centers (ASC) - The Centers, housed within each of the four colleges, are staffed by a full-time retention specialist. Staff members monitor student progression, perform registration outreach, and direct students to support services needed for success. 35411 \u00a7 The Center for Counseling and Student Development (CCSD) - The Center provides quality counseling and mental health services to students experiencing personal, developmental, and psychological issues or distress. The staff assist s students in crisis, intervene in potentially life threating situations, provide quality outreach programs, and offer other important additional services. These services address the developmental concerns of students while emphasizing prevention and professional consultative services that increase the understanding of challenges faced by students and promotes psychological well-being. \u00a7 Disability Support Services - Disability Support Services (DSSP) - Housed under the Division of Academic Affairs, DSSP has been charged to create an accessible university community to ensure students have equal access to University programs, activities, and services. The services to faculty, staff, and students on disability issues address the needs of individuals to improve the quality and effectiveness of servi ces; advocate for the upgrading and maintenance of the accessibility of all facilities; promote access to technology resources; and provide students with disabilities the same academic opportunities as non-disabled students in all areas of academic life. \u00a7 Center for Adult Learners (CAL) - The Center was formed with the adult learner in mind, given that the average age of the CSU student is 28 years of age. The goals of the CAL include the following: to increase educational opportunities for first -generation college students; to strengthen the level of engagement in the culture of academic rigor; to provide a campus climate in which adult learners demonstrate satisfaction with their program of study and go on to assume careers in their disciplines or continue matriculation into graduate or professional schools; to provide a model to be replicated on a larger-scale for the University; and to inform teaching and learning effectiveness through assessment. Cultural Diversity among Staff The Office of Human Resources (HR) offers a variety of workshops that support cultural diversity and inclusion. These workshops are offered on a regular basis and are available to all members of the campus community at least twice per year. Workshops include such topics on sensitivity training, managing diverse staff members, customer service, and conflict resolution. The workshops are conducted in conjunction with the Information Technology Division, Academic Affairs, and Finance and Administration. Diversity among Faculty Faculty Recruitment: Coppin's unique geographic location within the Baltimore City limits makes it an attractive environment for faculty to have careers and focus on instruction, research, and service to the University. Overall, faculty members find the campus to be a welcoming environment. The University makes every effort to advertise in diverse publications to ensure that individuals in the country and worldwide would have access to job opportunities with the University. These publications include, but are not limited to the Washington Post, the Chronicle of Higher Education, Diverse Issues, Latinos in Higher Education, LinkedIn, HigherEdjobs.com, and other publications that are able to reach remote areas. The University maintains subscriptions to diverse publications to ensure that when searches are conducted for new faculty, candidates will derive from diverse locations. While the limitations of dollars for advertising continue, the University is able to post positions in print and online journals, many of which may be discipline specific. Budget constraints have contributed to the 35512 University's inability to be even more aggressive in its recruitment and hiring of an appropriate number of faculty members across all its disciplines. Also, internally, the institution is reviewing its academic programs, to determine personnel and other resources necessary for successful implementation. III. A Description of the Process to Enhance Cultural Diversity A part of the University's strategic planning process requires the campus leadership to review KPIs related to metrics in the plan. Those metrics, which also impact diversity and inclusion , are a part of the review process and will be noted as needed attention or improvement by campus administrators. Furthermore, the Diversity and Inclusion Committee is charged with regularly monitoring the plan and looking for ways to improve diversity-related initiatives. The committee is also charged with assisting units with the development, assessment, and reporting of activities for public consumption. Lastly, the committee monitors the results and makes recommendations to the campus administration so that programs with selected metrics are supported so they do not fall short of unit-level or institutional goals. Key personnel also serve on the Diversity and Inclusion Committee, which include the Assistant Vice President for Planning and Assessment and the Director of Sponsored Research and Programs. In March 2021, the committee met to discuss options for increasing fundraising and other financial gifts to support scholarly research and activities aimed at producing a greater share of graduates and scholars who are of minority descent. The committee will continue to meet twice a semester or as recommended by administration. IV. Reporting Campus-Based Hate Crimes Although hate crimes have been zero or minimal at the University, the campus has several outlets for reporting hate crimes and any other malicious acts by students, faculty, and staff. CSU is compliant with the processes outlined by the USM as well as the federal requirements under the Clery Act of 1990. The process is detailed on the University's website (Campus Police site) at https://www.coppin.edu/downloads/file/1302/complaint_procedure. The campus police will investigate all complaints filed in a timely manner. The information is communicated to the public using the campus' annual Public Safety Campus Crime Report, which is posted to the university's home page. Also, as crimes are reported in and around the surrounding community, the Campus Police sends e-mail blasts describing the crimes and requested the community to always exercise caution. The public remains aware of any crimes primarily through this process. Students can report crimes through the Division of Student Affairs as well as Academic Affairs. Students involved in such incidents have access to the campus' judicial process, the campus police, and if necessary, Baltimore City's Police Department. Faculty and Staff can report crimes through the Office of Human Resources. This information is communicated to them through orientation processes as well as through professional development and training offered during the academic year. V. Summary of Resources Needed to Recruit and Retain a Culturally Diverse Student Body The Diversity and Inclusion Committee is in the process of examining resources and expenditures to determine resources needed to recruit and retain a culturally diverse student 35613 body.

The report contains the following four sections: SECTION I: How Frostburg State University Defines Diversity SECTION II: Successful Ongoing and New Institutional DEI Initiatives SECTION III: COVID-19's Effects on Efforts to Enhance Diversity APPENDIX: Frostburg State University Cultural Diversity Plan Additionally, an USM Addendum has been forwarded to the University System of Maryland, which describes Frostburg State University's top two or three areas of growth and/or challenge as it pertains to diversity, equity, inclusion, and/or combating structural racism. 3602 SECTION I HOW FROSTBURG STATE UNIVERSITY DEFINES DIVERSITY The Frostburg State University p olicy on Diversity states: \"The entire Frostburg State University community -- including the student body, the faculty and staff, the President of the University and its administration -- affirms its commitment to a campus environment which values human diversity and respects individuals who represent that div ersity. The community declares fostering diversity and respect for difference to be a fundamental goal of higher education, ranking among the highest priorities of this institution.\" Frostburg State University is a multicultural campus where diversity is highly valued. This is affirmed in the University's Core Values Statement : \"Frostburg State University is committed to developing cultural competence and cultivating understanding of and respect for a diversity of experiences and worldviews that encourage each person's ability to 'take the perspective of the other.'\" The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) works collaboratively with campus and local communities to foster a sense of inclusion among students of all ages, economic classes, ethnicities, gender identities, races, religions, sexual orientation and national origins. The University Council on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (UCDEI), which includes students, faculty , and staff who work together to provide oversight of DEI areas of concern , definitions of key terms related to diversity, and successes in an effort to close any gaps. The University provides professional development to employees and students to increase cultural competency through membership in professional organizations such as the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U); the Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education (NASPA) and the National Coalition Building In stitute (NCBI); utilizing the Linke dIn Learning platform to allow employees to increase learning through an online platform (recently establishing a DEI requirement to be met by all employees by March 2022 ); and cultivating internal stakeholder expertise in DEI through efforts such as the F SU Professional Development Conference. SECTION II SUCCESSFUL ONGOING AND NEW INSTITUTIONAL DEI INITIATIVES 1. Development of Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs, as the Diversity , Equity and Inclusion Officer/Officer and ongoing efforts of the UCDEI The UCDEI confirmed its mission and developed goals and for the 2020 -2021 academic year the council had made the needed adjustments to make action plan progress. Before being interrupted by COVID -19, focus groups were held in the spring 2020 semester to get input from the greater campus. A campus climate survey was conducted during the fall semester 2020 followed by additional focus groups in spring 2021. Meetings with stakeholder groups have been completed and are ongoing to assess achievements and needs to realize a more cohesive approach in improving equity. Recommendations are currently being compiled by the council to submit to the University Advisory Council (UAC) for a comprehensiv e plan for the 2021 -2022 academic year. Some of the notable progress of the council include : Conducted campus conversations and focus groups, \"Can We Talk?\" to further develop goals and action plans. Administered the HEDS Campus Climate and Equity Survey. Began developing plans and seeking funding to support the needed building and property renovations, and programming needed for a campus/community multicultural center (projected opening fall, 2021). Developed and administered a campus Safe Zone training pr ogram. Developing a plan to create racial justice on campus (in progress) Shifted the responsibility of the Cultural Diversity Plan from the Provost Off ice to the UCDEI and the 3613 Assistant Vice President (AVP) for Student Affairs, Diversity, Equity and Inclu sion Officer (DEIO) . 2. Recruit and Enroll a Growing Number of Undergraduate Minority and First -Generation Students Continuing s trategies under this goal include enhancing marketing and recruitment efforts that target members of underrepresented groups as well as expanding college -readiness and bridge programs offered by the University. 3. Increase the Retention and Graduation Rates of Undergraduate Minority and First -Generation Students Strengthening and expanding student support, mentoring, and advising programs are continuing strategies under this goal. Graduation rates amongst African Americans (56%) and all mino rity students (53%) improved and were greater than the overall graduation rate for the 2014 cohort (52%). However, retention rates, were slightly less (African Americans: 70% and 71% for all minority ) as compared to the all first -time/full -time (71%) . 4. Enhance the Cultural Diversity of Faculty and Staff Frostburg's Cultural Diversity Plan and its Equity and Inclusion Plan articulate a number of strategies for increasing the diversity of faculty and staff at the institution : All searches for faculty and staff positions at Frostburg target as broad and diverse an applicant pool as possible. Advertisements are posted nationally, and the University utilizes the diversity resources offered by various recruitment sites, e.g., the D iversity and Inclusion Package offered by HigherEdJobs. All searches in the Academic Affairs division require applicants to submit a statement outlining their commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, signaling Frostburg's commitment to these values and letting all qualified candidates know they are welcome at the University. All search committees for faculty and staff positions at Frostburg require one member of the committee to be responsible for ensuring that minority outreach is a priority. All search committees must submit documentation of minority recruitment efforts to FSU's Office of Human Resources and FSU's Director of ADA/EEO Compliance. Such efforts typically include: o Identifying discipline -specific advertising sites visible to minority candidates, e.g., MinorityNurse.com. o Contacting colleagues at other institutions to seek nominations of minority students nearing graduation, recipients of fellowships and awards, or other interested persons. o Making personal contacts with minorities at pro fessional conferences and inviting them to apply to FSU positions. 5. Create a Campus Environment that Promotes the Valuing of Cultural Diversity Providing campus- wide cultural and gender diversity programming and activities through the President's Advisory Council on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, Frostburg's Center for Student Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and the Office of Gender Equity; supporting campus student organizations that focus on diversity; and providing for the multicultural quality of the curriculum are important strategies designed to help the University attain this goal. 6. Promote the Understanding of International Cultures Continuing strategies under this goal are increasing the number of international students on campus, enhancing international programming, increasing international opportunities for students and faculty, and promoting intercultural knowledge at all levels of the campus. 3624 SECTION III COVID-19's EFFECTS ON EFFORTS TO ENHANCE DIVERSITY 1. A hindrance to the admissions' recruitment effort as we were limited in our ability to provide targeted recruitment this year due to the pandemic and staff turnover. 2. Increased difficulty in diversifying the faculty of staff. o Decreased hiring due to budgetary cuts. o Reluctance or inability of potential candidates to travel to or relocate to the campus. 3. Disproportionate economic impact on marginalized student populations. Applications to the CARES Act funding reflect: An increase in students needing to work, up to full-time status, to provide or support the family's income due to parents losing jobs. Difficulty in students securing reliable devices and/or internet service to complete online coursework. Several students obligated to provide care and support family members infected with the virus. 4. In contrast, the move to increase blended/online education has resulted in: The piloting of an online DEI platform for all first-year students. This program will be required for all first-year students in the 2021-2022 academic year and more effective and convenient for connecting with students whose participation was hindered by time conflicts with athletics, work schedules, and family obligations. Asynchronous online courses providing more flexibility in schedules for students to meet family and work obligations. The move to online and blended courses resulted in more faculty diversifying their curriculum and teaching modality with numerous professional development opportunities provided by the University. Student activities continued to engage students through a robust program of online programming. 3635 Required APPENDIX: Frostburg State University's Cultural Diversity Plan PREPARED BY THE CENTER FOR STUDENT DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION USM Goal 1: Increase the Numerical Representation of Traditionally Underrepresented Groups among Students, Administrative Staff, and Faculty.

The College of Business and the CIE have a formal draft agreement with HUEL and we expect students to begin transfer to FSU within the next academic year. The CIE expects to enroll 25-50 students from this new partner during the 2021/22 academic year. Assess the effectiveness of cooperative -degree programs as a recruitment strategy for international students and evaluate its impact on sustaining international education at FSU. The presence of study abroad opportunities for students and the level of participation in those programs During the academic year 2019/20, 40 FSU students participated in study abroad programs conducted or sponsored by the university. Originally 47 students were planning to study abroad; however, seven students withdrew due to the pandemic. These students were able to bring a wealth of experiences back to their classes and perhaps changed their outlook on the world. 37921 b) Plan and implement recruitment activities for students to study abroad. The presence of recruitment activities designed to encourage students to participate in study abroad. To encourage students to study abroad, the CIE engaged in the following recruitment activities in FY 2020: Conducted classroom visits Hosted bi-annual study abroad and international fairs Planned bi -weekly information sessions with prospective and former study abroad students to share experiences Held information tables in the Lane University Center Provided presentations to multiple Greek organizations Promoted study abroad at admissions open house events t o encourage prospective students to get excited about FSU and plan for their future study abroad opportunities. CIE will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of Horizons , as a software system to track applications of students interested in studying abroad, and assess its impact on meeting the CIE goals. c) Design and implement student abroad opportunities for students led by faculty members. The presence of faculty led study abroad opportunities for students As mentioned above, the CIE had recruited four FSU faculty to lead students on faculty -led experiences. Unfortunately, the trips were canceled due to the pandemic. d) Sustain the University President's Leadership Circle As an institutional program designed to provide students with opportunities to represent the university at key events, participate in intercultural experiences, and travel abroad to be part of cultural projects engaging exploited populations in different countries around the world. Presence of international experience for student members of the President's Leadership Circle. The students in the President's Leadership Circle did not participate in a service -learning trip to Uganda this year due to COVID -19 and funding. The circle continues to meet with the President, Dr. Travis and other special guest. There will be an Around the World program with food from various areas in the world that include Spain, Germany, Kenya, Italy and Australia. Some of the PLC members have aided in the planning of the event. Promote a more consistent use of the University's Leadership Competency Model to assess the student learning outcomes of the experiential learning opportunities provided to the PLC members. Provide a direct source of funding to continue the international, intercultural experience. 380 USM Goal 3: Provide a statement regarding the process for the reporting of campus -based crimes as consistent with federal requirements under Clery. Frostburg State University's Process for Reporting Campus- Based Hate Crimes and Bias-Motivated Incidents Hate crimes and bias -motivated incidents are violations of the University Student Code of Conduct as well as violations of law. Any such crimes that are reported to the University are handled by several offices of the University. Initial reports are handled by University Police, who conduct an investigation to determine if the incident is a hate crime or bias -motivated incident. If there is a victim involv ed, the determination of whether a hate crime has occurred is determined by the victim. If there is no victim, University Police will make the determination. When a perpetrator can be identified, University Police can charge the individual(s) criminally as well as refer them through the University Judicial System. Student cases that are reported to the Judicial Board for violations of University policy are reviewed. If students are found responsible, sanctions can include disciplinary action up to and including expulsion from the University. At the end of each month, University Police complete the hate crime report form and submit it as part of the Uniform Crime Report (UCR). At the end of each year, hate crimes and bias- motivated incidents are reported as required by the Clery Act and the Campus Crime Statistics Act (CCSA). 381 SALISBURY UNIVERSITY 3822020 -2021 Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Annual Progress Report Institution: Salisbury University Date Submitted: April 2021 Point of Contact: Joan Williams, Chief Diversity Officer and Associate Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion; jjwilliams@salisbury.edu 383Salisbury University (SU) Description of Diversity The following is the SU Diversity Statement. \"Diversity and inclusion are core values of Salisbury University. A diverse and inclusive campus community brings irreplaceable value to our educational experience and work environment, and strengthens us all. Diversity encompasses more dimensions than just the legally protected categories. All people have talent and potential that are spread across communities and groups, locally and globally. Inclusion means creating an environment of respect, connection and involvement among people with different experiences and perspectives. We strive to create a truly diverse and inclusive environment where the richness of ideas, backgrounds and perspectives of our community is harnessed to create value for our institution, today and in the future.\" This statement was adopted in 2015 when the SU Shared Governance's Cultural Diversity and Inclusion Consortium Committee (CD&ICC) was re constituted. The CD&ICC is comprised of diverse stakeholders from across campus who represent various constituent groups. The purpose of the committee is to assist campus leadership in weaving the diversity strategy throughout the University through providing advice, monitoring the campus climate as it relates to diversity, inclusion and equity, advocating for diversity and inclusion throughout the institution, advising on the recruitment and retention of a diverse faculty, staff and student body, developing programs and initiatives to promote the University's diversity goals and support community members, building network s to support the diversity mission, monitoring implementation of diversity goals of the Strategic Plan, and assessing progress and setting goals for improvement. The CD&ICC allowed for a collaborative process to be used in creating the diversity stateme nt that provided the opportunity for various campus stakeholders representing constituent groups to have input in the development of a campus statement; the statement was recommended to the President in 2015 for adoption. The committee created a digital w orking document to develop the key themes that committee members felt captured the comprehensive perspective that represents diversity at SU . The SU Office of Diversity and Inclusion added the following definition to it's webpage for further guidance. T his definition was developed after research and guidance from the SU Diversity Statement. \" Diversity refers to the variety of personal experiences, values and world views that arise from differences of culture and circumstance. Such differences include race, ethnicity, gender, age, religion, language, abilities/disabilities, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, geographic region and more. \" 384Highlight of the most successful ongoing and new institutional initiatives designed to address issues related to cultural diversity within the campus and the broader community, and how their efficacy is measured . In 2019, Salisbury University Office of Institutional Equity established a Campus Climate Study Workgroup. The group's work included acquiring an external consulting company, Rankin and Associates to conduct a campus -wide study of the campus climate. The company conducted focus groups and a campus -wide survey in spring 2020. Rankin and Associates presented a report of the findings in October 2020. December 2020 President Wight implemented a Campus Climate Study Implementation Committee comprised of members representing Shared Governance constituent groups. The committee was charged with reviewing the report for recommendation s that could be im plemented immediately. The committee recommended 18 actions to be considered for immediate implementation in April 2021 that were directly tied to information from the Campus Climate Study Report. Metrics will be developed for the recommendations. In sup port of a major objective in the Salisbury University's Strategic Plan, the Provost's Office has worked with a variety of stakeholders on a draft plan to recruit and retain diverse faculty in tenure- track positions. The plan is based on best practices and details planned activities from initial position justification, to recruitment, selection and hiring, onboarding, professional development and mentoring, preparing for tenure and promotion and post -tenure growth and success. This project has benefitted fr om the expertise available through Maryland's AGEP Promise Academy Alliance . Measures of efficacy will include number of faculty from under -represented groups hired into tenure- track positions, improvement in faculty retention, and, ultimately, increases in enrollment and retention of students from historically minoritized populations. Multicultural Student Services continues to operate the Powerful Connections pre- orientation and transition program for m ulticultural students to assist with recruitment, retention and creating a sense of belonging for students participating in the program. The program matches upper class students with first -time freshmen from diverse backgrounds to assist in the transition to college. Efficacy has been based on first-year retention data along with annual surveys of the program. The program has recently expanded to include collaborations with TRIO and the Disability Resource Center. May 2020, SU hired a Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) and Associate Vice President to lead strategic diversity efforts. Fall 2020 the CDO implemented campus -wide diversity training for employees and students to establish a baseline of common knowledge to build upon to assist in educating the campus community around topics to create a more inclusive campus environment . All employees took two courses, Diversity in the Modern Workplace and Managing Bias and Supervisors took an additional course, Accommodating Disabilities . 100 percent of em ployees completed the training. All new students will be required to complete diversity training starting in fall 2021. Efficacy will 385be measured through surveys regarding campus climate. Student training is still in progress until April 21, 2021. Ways in which the institution anticipates COVID -19 most affecting - either negatively or positively - efforts to enhance diversity on campus . Part of the preparation for COVID -19 included establishing and COVID -19 Inclusive Excellence Committee. The commi ttee included members from various constituent groups, including students and administrators. The committee identified potential challenges to maintaining inclusive excellence during the pandemic and made recommendations, including establishing an COVID -19 Inclusive Excellence Statement that was included in the training for all employees and students. We believe the pandemic will have a disproportionate negative impact on students of color due to the economic challenges it created. We believe this will result in decreased enrollment from traditionally under -represented populations. We believe that distance education has created greater inequities in various ways that will impact our retention of first year students of color. Due to Zoom fatigue, it has been more difficult to attract students to attend voluntary diversity programming. Diversity programming has continued to be offered for the community and the campus, especially around the Cultural Heritage Months. The pandemic created restrictions for student organizations to convene, which has impeded engagement during this academic year. This lack of engagement this year is predicted to yield challenges in reconvening student organizations and their operations next academic year. The pandemic will also impact negatively the college- readiness of new students of color, as well as increase their anxiety towards entering college, especially for first generation students. 386 TOWSON UNIVERSITY 3872020- 2021 Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Annual Progress Report Towson University Submitted April 12, 2021 Point of Contact: Dr Leah Cox, Vice President of Inclusion & Institutional Equity. lcox@towson.edu Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Annual Progress Report - Towson University I. Definition of Diversity Towson University (TU) has historically measured its diversity using key demographic data such as race, gender, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender identity, gender expression, religion, national origin, ability, political affiliation, military or veteran sta tus, and socioeconomic background. The institution has also recognized the difference in beliefs; values and ideologies contribute to the greater concept of diversity. For purposes of moving the institution in a more strategic and inclusive direction, we r ely on a common understanding that diversity is variety or difference within a collective. It is not an individual characteristic: A person is not diverse, but a group, team, office, community, or other collective can be diverse. While many may define dive rsity by race, it is crucial to acknowledge a more complex view of the wide range of variety in our campus community, which should be more inclusive and not limite d to any one specific identity. The plan for a More Inclusive TU relies on the shared understanding that diversity, equity, and inclusion are related terms, but they are not interchangeable. Equity refers to fairness in access, treatment, and opportunity. Equity is not the same as equality. Equity requires that we regu larly examine what supports and resources our diverse communities and populations need to have opportunities to achieve our stated goals and outcomes. In order for TU to achieve its mission for more inclusion, we must actively address and encourage the participation and contributions of all members of a community. Inclusion is not an automatic result of diversity. TU continues to strive to be the most diverse institution in the Maryland system. It also recognizes that it must also include in this goal the m ission to become equitable and inclusive so that all membe rs of our community can thrive. II. Successful Ongoing & New Institutional Initiatives In the past year, TU has responded promptly and intentionally to the wide range of current events that led to heightened attention to diversity, equity, inclusion, antiracism, and social justice. Before the senseless and violent deaths of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and countless others, TU had already prioritized building our capacity and skills a t engaging in necessary and challenging conversations around diversity, equity, and inclusion and systemic and structural inequities, including systemic racism. Since 2020, every new employee receives this information within one month of their start at TU. Last summer we welcomed our inaugural hate and bias coordinator who is proactively meeting with groups and providing education and sup port where they're most needed. The Office of Inclusion and Insti tutional Equity (OIIE) is nearing completion of its preliminary goal to engage with every Division and College across TU on foundational concepts \u2014diversity, equity, inclusion, cultural competency, unconscious bias \u2014as well as highlighting the skills our cam pus needs to further develop to increase our capacity for necessary and challenging conversations. TU continues to expand the scope and reach of Dialogue@TU to engage more of our campus on necessary and uncomfortable conversations about our identities, their intersections, and systems and structures of power. This work is already paying off through several new opportunities: 388 College Deans, chairs, and faculty: we are engaging f aculty at the department and college level in ongoing dialogues on race, de -centering whiteness, and structural racism. Senior leadership: education and training on structural racism and implicit bias. Virtual dialogue spaces: in response to the past year of current events of anti -Black and anti -Asian racism, we began offering virtual, race -alike affinity spaces for students, staff, and faculty to come together in support, community, healing, reflection, education, and action. We also launched a series of d irected discussion groups that will continue into the fall, linked with some of the many useful books, podcasts, and other readings tied to critically examining whiteness, systemic racism, and engaging with anti -racism. We have begun to transform the hiring process for faculty and staff by incorporating education on de - biasing the search process and relying on trained inclusion advocates to support each faculty search. TRHT: Last summer a team from TU was selected to attend AAC&U's Truth, Racial Healin g & Transformation (TRHT) Campus Centers Institute. The TRHT framework relies on racial healing circles, which involve many of the same skills involved in dialogue. TU's BTU Presidential Priority continues to strengthen connections with local communities a nd organizations, further strengthening TU's role as an anchor institution for the Baltimore metropolitan area. Most recently, BTU hosted a discussion on the history of gentrification in Baltimore City. III. Effects of COVID -19 When the institution was for ced to reconsider our approach to learning and programs due to COVID -19, it became extremely important to pivot how we planned and approached the continuance of DEI work at TU. While it was important to continue fulling the mission of the institution, the transition exposed the inequities among students, faculty, and employees at all levels. We were pushed to recognize and address as many inequities as possible, and to find strategies and solutions. The most prominent reoccurring issues ex perienced during COVID- 19 were: Our women, transgender, and gender diverse students, experienced higher levels of stress, anxiety, and need for emotional support. The inability to form a community, to live in a supportive environment, and the ability to access mental health services regularly highlighted the inequities these students experienced. It also suggested the need for additional services and programs on our campus. Our Black, multiracial, and Asian students experienced emotional distress during the time of social un rest related to anti -black and anti -Asian violence. The financial burdens experienced by our students and their families forced the university to consider how to address food insecurities, student loss of campus employment, and the disparities created because of the socioeconomic status of their families. Freshman and transfer students who chose not to live on campus have not gained a sense of community. Disabled students struggled in multiple ways to receive accommodations, having never identified or registered with the Office of Accessibility and Disability Services (ADS) . Specialists attempted to address student need for support and student success. These students also suffered emotional and mental health issues that required specialized counseling support. The difficulties of our students who also were managing families during the pandemic. It reminded all of us that our students are diverse and have different needs. One size does not fit all. The pandemic also allowed us to reach out to provide education, training, and dialogue to faculty and staff members of the community that had not taken part in the past. 389 Provision of multiple instructional and informati on videos on ally ship , addressing stereotypes during COVID- 19, the development of faculty resources, and policies. Attendance of faculty and staff at multiple DEI programs, activities, and trainings that were accessible with zoom. Providing training and e ducation to faculty on inclusive online teaching practices that address inequities in technology access, unconscious bias involving camera usage, as well as issues of discrimination, harassment, and microaggressions experienced by our students in virtual learning spaces. Our faculty are learning to provide culturally competent advising, heightening their attentiveness and care to the lived experiences of their diverse students. Many of the disparities that existed before are now more visible . Understanding how the structural and socioeconomic status of our students can affect their ability to be successful. Many of the faculty requested and engaged in workshops, trainings, and book groups, to understand beyond their own privilege. IV.

This plan provides a critical piece of the roadmap for the future of T owson University as we enter our 155 th year. The completion of this plan has taken place during a time where the nation is addressing and focusing on the issues of institutional and systemic racism, inequality and social justice using an anti-racist lens. This plan is designed to meet TU's aspiration to become a more inclusive and equitable institution of distinction. We know and are proud of the fact that TU is already one of the most diverse higher education institutions in the nation and is staunchly committed to building an inclusive, equitable and diverse campus community. Since 2016, diversity, equity and inclusion have been at the forefront of our mission as we strive to become an institution of inclusive excellence. This plan, A More Inclusive TU: Advancing Equity and Diversity, represents the next phase in our pursuit of being recognized as a distinguished public institution thatadvances equitable access, inclusive learning and engagement in a diverse community. The goals outlined in this document, along with our vision and collective voice for change, will provide a pathway to achieving this goal. This plan is consistent with our university-wide strategic plan, building upon our most important goals. It should be acknowledged that this plan does not represent the sum total of all that we are and all that we need to do or will do. Conversations with more than 250 members of the campus revealed the numerous programs, activities, initiatives and efforts already underway that are shaping and changing TU. These conversations also revealed the need to continue to address and remove structural inequities. In order to focus our efforts and resource them appropriately, we have limited the number of initiatives, programs and efforts elevated herein. The goal of this plan builds upon the investments and intentions made by many members of the campus to create positive change. Lastly, as a community we must hold ourselves accountable for the change we seek to realize. We will assess our progress, adjust to the results, listen to new ideas and continue to facilitate frank conversations about issues on our campus. Thank you for working to create a more inclusive and equitable Towson University. Leah Cox, Ph.D. Vice President, Inclusion and Institutional Equity Kim Schatzel, Ph.D. President 394TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 3Towson University is one of the most diverse higher education institutions in the nation. TU is staunchly committed to building a campus community that embraces a wide spectrum of human and academic experiences. With that in mind, T owson University is Welcome to TU intentionally engaged in proactively transforming the culture and climate of the university to reflect the changing society in which we study, live and work. This strategic plan is grounded firmly in the belief that TU's ongoing success is dependent on our capacity to shift perspectives and approaches and strategically place diversity, equity and inclusion at the core of our mission through academic programs and environment, leadership and mentoring, community engagement, day-to-day decision-making, interpersonal relation-ships, collaborations and organizational culture. This document, A More Inclusive TU: Advancing Equity and Diversity, seeks to advance Towson University as a nationally recognized leader in diversity, equity and inclusion within the higher education sector. The success of this plan requires every member of our community to actively contribute in its implementation. Towson University has historically mea- sured its diversity using key demographic data such as race, gender, ethnicity, sexual identity, gender identity, gender expression, religion, national origin, ability, political affiliation, military or veteran status and socioeconomic background. We also recognize that differences in beliefs, values and ideologies are a part of the greater concept of diversity. Focusing solely on diversity doesn't acknowledge the importance of an equitable, inclusive and supportive environment where historically marginalized, underrepresented and underserved members of our community can succeed. It is imperative we make an intentional commitment to explore and support new strategies that will enable every member of the TU community to thrive and reach their fullest potential. The Diversity Strategic Plan Task Force (\"task force\") convened in December 2018 and was charged with articulating recom-mendations to President Kim Schatzel for a bold vision and implementation plan for diversity, equity and inclusion at TU over the next five years. The eight Presidential Priorities 1, the university's Diversity Initiatives Progress Report 2 and this document build a comprehensive strategy for inclusive excellence at TU and are a collective outgrowth of the president's core values, strategic diversity actions and deep commitment to inclusion and equity. The Towson University of today is not the Towson State College of years ago. TU is poised and equipped to take on this opportunity to implement a bold strategic plan to create a more diverse, equitable and inclusive institution where all feel welcome, valued and supported to succeed. 1 https://www.towson.edu/about/administration/president/priorities/ 2 https://www.towson.edu/inclusionequity/diversity/diversity-progress.html 395TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 4Our Vision This document provides a vision for the institution that clearly and deliberately maps a progressive plan that advances inclusive excellence while implementing and maintaining a focus on equity. We clarify our working definitions of inclusive excellence and TU's equity toolkit along with our other key terms: diversity , equity and inclusion. We can't assume nor expect all members of our community to understand our institution's history or make sense of it in the same way. In fact, we recognize reconciliation is an ongoing process and must acknowledge a diversity of perspec-tives on and lived experiences with any singular moment in time. In developing this five-year strategic plan, the Towson University leadership looks to strengthen its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion across our institution while also acknowledging that this work has its roots in a past rich with complex stories of success, pain, accomplishment, struggle and, ultimately, hope that TU will continue to move forward with a reconciled and more inclusive history. This report presents information on the current state of Towson University in terms of diversity, equity and inclusion and puts forth recommendations based on quantitative and qualitative data from constituents across the institution. The development of the plan was informed by an inclusive strategic planning process. 3 Over a 15-month period the task force engaged hundreds of students, staff, faculty, alumni and community partners. We convened working groups, held campus forums, provided presentations and asked participants to share, both in person and online, their ideas and dreams for TU's mission and strategic priorities related to diversity, equity and inclusion. A number of other system and campus initiatives and reports complemented the task force's work, including TU's overall Strategic Planning process; the Middle States Commission on Higher Education Self Study process at TU and innovative initiatives such as the one created with a $1 million grant from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute spearheaded by Jess & Mildred Fisher College of Science & Mathematics faculty Laura Gough and Matthew Hemm. We referred to the work of other institutions of higher education 4, leading organizations in equity and inclusion metrics, prominent scholars in the field of diversity in higher education and reports produced by such entities as the American Council on Education, the Harvard Business Review and the Race and Equity Center at The University of Southern California. 3 Williams, D.

Only by engaging at college, department and unit levels can strategies be prioritized, translated or adapted into relevant and consequential activities. The implementation of this plan is dynamic and will continually evolve; data will be reviewed each year to support decision-making and organizational change. The plan provides actionable timelines, responsible parties and metrics to help assess our advancement of diversity, equity and inclusion in the short and long term.\"TU is not stuck and is moving forward. I think the past at Towson University is what is helping to propel us forward. ASIAN FACULTY & STAFF ASSOCIATION FOCUS GROUP 398SECTION 2 Key Terms and Concepts | DIVERSITY STRATEGIC PLAN | 399TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 8Key Terms Diversity Diversity is variety or difference within a collective. It is not an individual characteristic: A person is not diverse, but a group, team, office, community or other collective can be diverse. While discussions around diversity often focus on race, it is crucial to consistently take a fuller and more complex view of the wide range of variety in our campus community, including but not limited to: Ability status Age Ancestry Body size Citizenship status Economic status Educational status Employment status Ethnicity Food security Gender identity Gender expression Housing security Incarceration experience Language Marital/partnership status Military/veteran status National origin Neurodiversity Political affiliation Pregnancy/reproductive status Race/racial identity Religious affiliation/ spiritual practice Sex assigned at birth Sexual identity KEEP IN MIND This plan relies on a common understanding that diversity, equity and inclusion are related terms, but they are not interchangeable. One of the foundations for the success of this plan is for the TU community to consistently and accurately use and distinguish between them. 400TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 9Equity Equity refers to fairness in access, treatment and opportunity. Equity is NOT the same as equality. Equality implies sameness, two or more members of a community being identical or having identical identities, cultures and experiences. Equity requires we regularly examine what supports and resources our diverse communities and populations need to have the opportunity to achieve our stated goals and outcomes ( SEE FIGURE 1 ). Ongoing efforts to strive for equity may, in fact, appear to some as treating people or groups differently. Putting equity into practice requires a shift of perspective from an external focus on individuals and communities (achievement gap) to an internal focus on our institution and its policies, practices and programs (opportunity gap). Equality Equity 5 https://www.rwjf.org/en/library/infographics/visualizing-health-equity.html\"I have worked here for 11 years, and we hav e a long way to go, but I also see TU working hard and am encouraged by that. I see the change in students. STAFF/FACULTY FOCUS GROUP ON RETENTIONFIGURE 1 / DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN EQUALITY AND EQUITY (COURTESY OF THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUND ATION)35 401TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 10Inclusion Inclusion refers to active participation and contribution by all members of a community and is NOT an automatic result of diversity. A department, organization, college, team, division or other unit may be diverse while still not necessarily fostering inclusion, as depicted in FIGURE 2 below. It is crucial to distinguish between and accurately use our key terms of diversity, equity and inclusion. Remembering these terms and ideas are different means we need to regularly assess whether all of them have been achieved at every level (e.g., team, organization, department, unit, college, division). The simultaneous presence of all three fosters a TU culture grounded in belonging and fairness ( SEE FIGURE 3 ). \"We have diversity\" ...and \"We have diversity\" ...and integration \"...AND inclusion \"KEEP IN MIND Having diversity does not guarantee also having inclusion. FIGURE 2 / THE PRESENCE OF DIVERSITY DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE PRESENCE OF INCLUSION. 402TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 11Inclusive Excellence Inclusive excellence is often defined as a range of concepts ranging from a mindset, to a planning process, to a framework, to a goal, to a vision. In prioritizing it as a central component of this plan, we needed to start with its core definition as used within higher education and then adapt it to TU's specific needs and vision. The Association of American Colleges and Universities (AACU) change model for inclusive excellence 6 proposes four primary elements: Focus on student intellectual and social development Purposeful development and utilization of resources to enhance student learning Attention to cultural difference Welcoming community Their newly released vision statement of excellence in undergraduate education is grounded specifically in equity and inclusion and stresses two priorities: 1) the what and why of undergraduate learning and 2) the importance of helping all students achieve those. Inclusive e x cellence takes direct aim at educational disparities and patterns of systemic disadvantage\u2014especially those resulting from historical and contemporary effects of racism. 7 Our commitment to inclusive excellence does not focus solely on outcomes but also the process, which must be highly collaborative and equipped to engage thoughtfully and respectfully in challenging conversations. 6 Williams, D.

Think of social identity markers as the conscious and unconscious ways we view each other with perceived or actual status based on the wide range of diversity. This toolkit should be applied in many ways at the institution: Communities and cultures (groups, networks, traditions) Climate (classroom, academic department, division/department/unit) Mission (teaching, research and scholarship, outreach) Policies, practices, procedures Collaborations with internal and external constituencies TU's equity toolkit is a foundational resource for implementing this plan. It recognizes that everyone does not have access to the same opportunities, and it is important to identify and address inequities by removing systemic barriers and accommodating differences. The ultimate goal of the toolkit is to support an intentional, university- wide process where each division, college, department or unit can embark upon an ongoing process that identifies new opportunities to support TU's transformation to a campus community where people from diverse backgrounds can participate fully, thrive and contribute at TU. The implementation process typically begins from a university-wide foundation of guiding/reflection questions followed by additional prompts specific to any office, department, division or other area of work within the university. In early stages, consider the following as a guide: What is the current norm, practice or tradition? Whose interests are being served? Whose interests are being underserved? Which individuals or groups are currently equipped and empowered to make decisions? What assumptions need to be critically re-examined? What mechanisms do we use or can we implement to assess equity and inclusion in our work regularly? What is the most appropriate next step? What are the risks if we do nothing? What will the impact be if equity toolkit resources are not implemented in this case? The challenge of identifying, educating, motivating and measuring progress in each of these elements has guided our strategies, timelines and action plan. We lay out in a separate section below the specific guidelines that ground this plan in inclusive excellence and equity.I enjoy having the opportunity to collaborate across offices to connect students with resources they might need. STAFF/FACULTY FOCUS GROUP ON RETENTION\" 404TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 13Our task force goes further to frame inclusive excellence at TU as an ongoing commitment to build our capacity to embed diversity, equity and inclusion in everything we do; to assess regularly; and to adapt. This strategic plan calls for a commitment to inclusive excellence and equity. Our ongoing success is dependent on centering equity as a key component of this work, and it will set TU apart nationally. Diversity Strategic Plan Objective 405SECTION 3 Our Past, Present and Progress | DIVERSITY STRATEGIC PLAN | 406TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 15In the past 50 years Towson University has experienced demographic shifts in both size and diversity (SEE FIGURE 4 ). This growth has led to the creation of new programs, majors, positions and development of policies and plans that have helped lead TU to achieve important milestones in diversity and inclusion that set us apart at the state and national levels.Where We Are Now Demographics In the 2019 \"Chronicle of Higher Education Almanac,\" Towson University was among the top 15 four-year public institutions in the nation in \"Colleges with the Greatest Percentage Gains and Losses in the Number of Black Students, 2010 to 20178.\" Further, from 2010-2018, the proportion of racial/ethnic minority students increased 19%9, the largest increase at any Maryland public institution and the largest among any Maryland institution with 500 or more students 10. 8 Towson University saw a 64.7% increase in Black enrollment from 2010-2017 9 The proportion of racial/ethnic minority students in overall head count enrollment increased from 21% in fall 2010 to 40% in fall 2018. 10 U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics, Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), 2010 and 2018 Fall Enrollments, Retrieved on March 4, 2020.

This rate has been increasing steadily from around 59% in 1998 to at or above 70% for the past four years. In the last two years, there has not been an achievement gap for African American students. Hispanic/Latinx and Asian students have also been very close to the overall rate. However, there are some differences when we look at gender and four-year rates. Women Cohort White African American Cohort White African American majority of cases, men did not achieve the same level of success as women from the same racial/ethnic group. Also, Asian men were the only male group to meet or ex ceed the overall graduation rate. Another area of concern is the gap at four years. While most racial/ethnic groups of students caught up, or came close, to the overall graduation rate of six years, there were noticeably larger gaps when looking at the four-year rates. Again, this is the same group of students, the fall 2012 cohort, measured in summer 2016.FIGURE 5 / FIGURE 5 / RA RACE/ETHNICITY AND GENDER OF ALL TCE/ETHNICITY AND GENDER OF ALL T OOWSON UNIVERSITY EMPLWSON UNIVERSITY EMPL OOYEES 2018YEES 2018 FIGURE 6 / SIX-YEAR GRADUATION RATES - RACE/ETHNICITY FIGURE 7 / SIX-YEAR GRADUATION RATES OF FIRST-TIME STUDENTS - RACE/ETHNICITY/GENDER FIGURE 8 / FOUR-YEAR GRADUATION RATES OF FIRST-TIME STUDENTS - RACE/ETHNICITY White - 73% (1660) African American / Black - 77% (306)3 Hispanic / L atino - 68% (127)3 Asian - 69% (123) Other URM - 66% (87) Other - 68% (157) Total Cohort - 73%FIGURE 5 / RACE/ETHNICITY AND GENDER OF ALL TOWSON UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES 2018 408TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 17Graduation Rates Although many public universities continue to struggle to address demonstrable gaps between racial and ethnic groups in student learning, Towson University has much of which to be proud. The term achievement gap alludes to outputs, including the unequal or inequitable distribution of educational results. Learning gaps are the disparities between actual learning and expected learning for students11 and can be the result of achievement gaps. Unlike many institutions across the country, TU does not have a demonstrative racial achievement or learning gap even in the face of the increasing enrollment of racial minorities. Of particular note: while the national six-year graduation rate is 43%, it is 73% for all TU students and for A frican American TU students, it is 77%.12 Our commitment to equitable access to and support for a TU education continues to extend beyond race and ethnicity and prioritizes all historically underserved student populations\u2014grounded in the more expansive way we define diversity above. In fact, through the implementation of our equity toolkit resources, the conversations shift from a sole focus on individual student performance\u2014achievement and learning gaps\u2014to a more complex examination of systemic, structural and institutional barriers and the ways in which TU can further transform our policies, procedures and practices\u2014 opportunity gaps\u2014that prioritize inclusive excellence and equity. Strategic Diversity and Inclusion Leadership In 2017 President Kim Schatzel created the Office of Inclusion & Institutional Equity (OIIE) and the position of vice president of inclusion & institutional equity. This key role established a vision of creating a more inclusive TU, positioning OIIE as a hub that intentionally works collaboratively across all divisions and rejecting conventional notions of working exclusively in silos. 11 Coleman, J.

UNIVERSITY ACCESSIBILITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOCUS GROUP\" 409TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 18Milestones In the past 50 years TU has supported programs and offices that have integrated the campus and supported underrepresented students in their academic pursuits. The Center for Student Diversity\u2014formally known as the Office of Minority Affairs, Office of Multicultural Student Life and Office of Diversity Resources\u2014was established in 1969 to facilitate the access and integration of Black students into the university and advocate on their behalf. Soon after, the Black Student Union also was founded. The center now provides advocacy, support, mentoring and programming for diverse students across the campus. Diversity and Inclusion Faculty Fellows Academic Affairs has instituted initiatives to support faculty in further developing inclusive classrooms and diverse research agendas. For example, in 2014 TU's Diversity and Inclusion Faculty Fellows program was established to support TU faculty who are already engaged or interested in the development or redesign of courses for major or core curriculum, curricular practices to support inclusive classroom environments, research and teaching projects, pedagogy and research toolkits, scholar-practitioner collaborations and/or building collaborations to enhance diversity and inclusion. 410SECTION 4 Strategic Plan Methods | DIVERSITY STRATEGIC PLAN | 411TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 20The Charge In late September 2018, President Kim Schatzel provided a charge and goals for the task force. This initiated an institution-wide planning process that sought input from the entire campus community, including students, faculty, staff, administrators and alumni. The year-long process employed a social justice framework and solicited feedback from across the campus as well as intentionally seeking voices who are often overshadowed\u2014ultimately striving for the representation of all entities who are integral to the work of providing a world-class education through a holistic experience. The task force was charged by President Schatzel with four primary questions: How do we further promote the president's Model for Campus Diversity? What is the climate on campus related to diversity and inclusion, and how is it experienced by individuals and members of the community? What is needed to recruit and retain a diverse faculty, senior administration and student population? How do we further cultivate a culturally responsive campus where all community members feel a sense of belonging? Priority areas included: education and scholarship, recruitment, retention and campus climate.Strategic Plan Methods 412TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 21Data Collection From March through September 2019, all stakeholders in the TU community were invited via the following methods to participate in the data collection process: The task force website TU news article The task force video The task force web page online feedback form The task force email account, inclusion@towson.edu In an effort to include many voices across the Towson University community,the task force scheduled data collection opportunities based on the aforementioned priority areas, TU affiliations and intentional focus groups, which were identified in response to the earlier data collection to ensure representation of all communities and populations. A total of 278 people participated in the focus groups. TU stakeholders were able to participate in: Focus groups moderated by a team of two facilitators One-on-one interviews with a designee from OIIE Anonymous online submissions via the OIIE website Data Analysis and Coding From September through October 2019, a nine-member task force coding subcommittee of students, faculty, staff and administrators reviewed the raw data, identified patterns of concerns and determined common language. The coding process included: Reflecting and acknowledging one's own personal biases Accessing the raw data as organized by the four priority areas Drafting a list of major themes and patterns of belief Noting unexpected themes, words and responses\"If we want to change the culture, we need training, new policies and to say we are starting in a place that acknowledges the issues at hand and [the importance of] being proactive. LGBTQ+ FACULTY & STAFF ASSOCIATION FOCUS GROUP 413TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 22Outcomes As a result of this process, three major themes emerged as a launching point for decisions concerning proposed goals, initiatives and actions. Work climate Exclusion/inclusion Initiatives and programs An overarching theme of mentoring cut across all other areas. Implementation Guidelines for Equity and Inclusive Excellence The task force reviewed sample diversity plans from other institutions, national best practices for strategic diversity leadership in higher education and the most recent institutional data in order to identify current and cutting-edge approaches, knowing that our history propels Towson University to invoke a radical culture shift with bold and measurable actions that are both aspirational and actionable. The American Council on Education's (ACE) 2018 report, \"Speaking Truth and Acting with Integrity: Confronting Challenges of Campus Racial Climate,\" offers a useful framework for campus capacity building and resiliency, specifically in response to racial tensions on campuses. 414TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 23The ACE report finds \"high diversity and inclusion capacity 13 \" schools pursue the following priorities: Strong diversity plans, mission statements and guiding values for diversity and inclusion work Leaders exhibiting knowledge of diversity and inclusion practices and research Leaders working to build trust and respect across stakeholder groups Investment in continual learning, education and training at all levels Regular assessment of campus progress with feedback loops Active disruption of oppressive practices and systems Opportunities and support provided to marginalized communities Value placed on individuals/units that provide diversity and inclusion leadership on campus This strategic plan considers how these priorities can be implemented beyond just race and culminates in a series of overarching, evidenced-based goals with corresponding action items and specific and measurable steps laid out to help transform TU as well as the unit(s) responsible for implementation. By centering equity along with inclusion and diversity at the core of TU's mission, this plan goes even further by relying on newer research (Chun & Feagin, 2020) that rethinks higher education diversity frameworks and offers specific leadership strategies for implementation such as: Conducting an institutional diversity audit Establishing top-level strategies and expected outcomes based on equity, diversity and inclusion principles Calling out the difficult issues Proactively addressing underrepresentation of nondominant faculty Monitoring institutional processes for equitable outcomes Investing in systematic and sustained diversity education Creating an institutional safety net of resources and support Assessing the impact of admissions criteria and financial aid on underrepresented students Critically evaluating faculty workload models Conducting research on demographic changes and inclusion.14 These guidelines taken together serve as the foundation for the specific action items included in this plan. 13 The ACE Report identifies three categories of institutions: low, moderate and high diversity and inclusion capacity. 14 Chun, E. B., & Feagin, J. R. (2020). Rethinking Diversity Frameworks in Higher Education. New York: Routledge.\"Institutions demonstrating high levels of capacity for [diversity and inclusion] work to include racial incidents and campus racial climate have moved beyond the rhetoric of diversity to investing significant resources and time in developing a strategic plan for diversity and inclusion.\" AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION (ACE) 415TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 24In the development of this plan, we realize the entire university must work with urgency yet exercise patience regarding outcomes. Given this balanced perspective, TU will continue to measure short-term action items while anticipating long-term results. Towson University leadership will draw on simple, clear metrics to determine progress on goals and action items.Working with Urgency and Patience Our Approach The following approach to measuring progress from the University of California, Davis (2017)15 was used to determine measurement, timelines and responsible units: Create multidimensional benchmarks to track real progress, facilitate data-driven decision-making and support the Presidential Priorities Disaggregate demographic data to better identify populations that need attention Show trends over time Support benchmarking against peers where valid and useful Reflect, as much as possible, the current ways we understand ourselves individually, our university and our world Tell the story of diversity, equity and inclusion at T owson University by dispelling myths, highlighting data and advancing critical strategies Provide enough fle xibility for bold, innovative ideas for which no current benchmark exists Specific oversight responsibilities will be assigned throughout the university, especially within divisions, colleges and departments to encourage campus support for this progress and evolution of the TU culture. Recognizing that inclusive excellence has been typically measured by scorecard tools 16 (Williams, 2005), this plan relies on applying our definition of inclusive excellence along with our equity toolkit. A robust and adept equity and inclusion measurement and assessment working group will prompt and support campus-wide measurement, reporting and monitoring. 15 University of California, Davis. (2017).

Toward a model of inclusive excellence and change in higher education. Washington, DC: AAC&U. 416TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 25Strategic Measurement and Assessment Questions The task force developed assessment questions that spanned the institution. For students, we have considered categories of ethnicity, race, gender identity, gender expression, sexual identity, ability status, military/veteran status, age, income, national origin, citizenship status, educational attainment ofparents, food security, housing security and residency status. For our employees, we considered educational level, rank, salary, duration of employment, citizenship and nation of earned degree(s). We also examined our current and aspirational peers for their strategic priorities and actions related to diversity, equity and inclusion. STUDENTS Are certain colleges/schools/majors more welcoming to diversity than others? What colleges/schools/majors are growing, and is that growth sufficient to make an impact on needed shifts in demographics ? What relationships e xist between our diversity and degree completion rates, including time to degree? Are underrepresented or disadvantaged undergraduate students falling out of the pipeline to graduation ? If so , where? Are graduate and professional students falling out of the pipeline to degree completion ? If so , where? Where are native born, underrepresented graduate students in their field coming from ? How can we make the social and academic environments more conducive to emotionally and physically healthy, insightful, aware and successful students? WORKFORCE Are we experiencing diversity across all positions ? Are certain positions and classifications more diverse than others? How are demographics changing in colleges and departments ? Are the changes significant enough to make a sufficient impact on demographics of faculty and staff ? Are colleges and departments retaining student employees, faculty and staff, and is that sufficient to mak e an impact on demographics ? What can retention rates, turnover rates, duration of hire, vacancy rate and turnover quotients tell us about who is leaving and when?\"There are people who have taken a special interest in elevating me, and, once I start to get burned out, I am given the opportunity to move up or grow in professional development. LATINX FACULTY & STAFF ASSOCIATION FOCUS GROUP 417TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 26 Where are opportunities for providing greater stability in the workforce, particularly among underrepresented or historically marginalized groups? Who is advancing and being promoted more quickly? Are there differences in who receives tenure and in what positions? How equitably are financial resources distributed in terms of salary , benefits and professional development support? PEER BENCHMARKING How does Towson University compare to institutions in the University System of Maryland and peer institutions across the country in terms of strategic diversity , equity and inclusion goals and initiatives ? 418SECTION 5 Strategic Plan Action Items | DIVERSITY STRATEGIC PLAN | 419TU | DIVERSITY S TRATEGIC PLAN 28 Action Items Four Overarching Goals: 1 EDUCATION AND SCHOLARSHIP: Provide ongoing teaching, learning, research and service opportunities to prepare and support students, alumni, current and retired staff and faculty to address diversity , equity and inclusion issues in disciplinary and interdisciplinary fields and all areas of work at T owson University . 2 RECRUITMENT, RETENTION AND SUCCESS: Create or revise protocols, policies, procedures and practices that create a pipeline for high-caliber students, staff and faculty to join, stay and succeed at T owson University .

In accordance with this, each institutional submission should include a brief narrative (no more than three pages), consisting of the sections outlined below. Please ensure all submissions adhere to these guidelines. Additional supplemental information such as data analysis or more comprehensive programmatic information may be provided as an appendix, but the core narrative should not exceed this three -page limit.\" The sections of the narrative pertain to: (1) how the institution defines diversity; (2) successful ongoing and new institutional DEI initiatives; and (3) COVID -19's effects on efforts to enhance diversity. The sections are fully described (copied and pasted from MHEC's memo) in the attached file. In addition , you must provide, as an appendix, a copy of the diversity plan currently in place at your institution. Finally, we are requesting a USM Addendum in which you should briefly describe your institution's top two or three areas of growth and/or challenge as it pertains to diversity, equity, inclusion, and/or combating structural racism . As was the case last year, you do not have to submit demographic tables. \" 4381. Describe how the University defines d iversity and how the definition is developed : The University of Baltimore defines and describes the \"diversity\" of our campus environment in the following ways. These referenced definitions are the outcome of the University's unit leadership and its governance process, which includes campus -wide representation of students, faculty and staff. In general, UBalt describes \"diversity\" as: \"A situation that includes representation of multiple (ideally all) groups within a prescribed environment, such as a university or a workplace. This word most commonly refers to differences between cultural groups, although it is also used to describe differences within cultural groups, e.g. diversity within the Asian -American culture includes Korean Americans and Japanese Americans. An emphasis on accepting and respecting cultural differences by recognizing that no one culture is intrinsically superior to another underlies the current usage of the term. \" http://www.ubalt.edu/campus - life/diversity -and-international -services/diversity -dictionary.cfm In addition, the UB Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Committee is one of several committees of the UBalt Governance Steering Council. This committee , by virtue of its role, has defined diversity at UBalt within the committee's mission , which is to advance and champion the University's DEI goals and strategies . The committee's efforts exemplify how UB defines diversity to strengthen the professional, intell ectual, and cultural experiences of all members of the UB community. The DEI Committee is charged with recommending actions to the University's Governance Steering Council that help promote a university -wide appreciation and integration of diverse and inclusive ideas, practices and capabilities at all levels of the University. Specifically, the committee may maintain a progressive action plan for University -wide diversity, equity, and inclusion measures, communicate to UB audiences the University's diversity objectives and initiatives, make policy recommendations and, when necessary, contribute to the preparation of various University reports. The definition of diversity can change over time; therefore, the Committee members serve as DEI ambassadors for faculty, staff, students and facilitators of campus diversity -related news in order to stay current and abreast of campus developments . The committee membership is composed of representatives of each governance body as well as university volunteers. The committee meets regularly and discusses timely topics that support the University's mission and advance the committee's charge , and produces information that is helpful to the Council and University leadership for decision making. The committee members , through its process of document review, meeting , and discussion, are the means by which agreement is reached and refreshed for the definition of terms used. All of these efforts together throughout the year continuously refine UBalt' s definition of the term \"diversity ,\" which is embedded in the work of the University offices, academic units and DEI Committee. It is further noted that University units may have specific plans and policies for diversity in faculty hiring, which may also include a statement of values, definitions, and principles (e.g., see University of Baltimore School of Law Plan for Diversity in Faculty Hiring: Recruitment and Retention). 4392. Highlight the most successful ongoing or new institutional initiatives (one page) The University's work on DEI matters is expressed through a wide range of efforts under way across the University. Two areas are highlighted to serve as exemplary succ essful institutional initiatives for reporting year 2020 -2021 . Effectiveness of these initiatives are measured by various means, including student response, campus climate surveys, media coverage, course evaluations, performance measures for office units, etc. The first area highlighted is the University's longstanding and continued support for s tudent engagement and student i nitiatives . For example, U Balt's active Student Government Association led several activities during the fall 2020 semester. Among them, in September 2020, prior to the fall U.S. presidential election, the SGA issued Resolution #10, requesting the University of Baltimore and USM to take a stance against the Sept. 2020 White House Executive Order on Combating Race and Sex Stereo typing. This leadership action joined with other national calls by access, equity and diversity focused organizations. The University 's president shared the Resolution with Chancellor Jay Perman and provided key information alongside the SG A's leadership o n the topic . This information included the USM's (July 2020) statement, reputable national organization news release s, as well as his knowledge of anticipated national next -level actions with the SGA 's leadership . The UBalt DEI Committee was notified of Resolution #10 and asked to monitor it on behalf of SGA. The federal Executive Order was subsequently rescinded post -election by the new federal administration in January 2021. Together, the U Balt community addressed this con cern. Additionally, i n recognition of UBalt's diverse community, the SGA -led a banner rainbow painting of an on - campus alleyway to represent different cultures and faces of our community , held an afternoon vigil and participated with testimony before the M aryland General Assembly on related topics to help inform policymakers. These are just some examples of the enthusiasm and commitment of the SGA, whose work the UBalt community greatly values. Administrative offices also led activities in FY 20 -21. For example, t he UB Student Support Services ' Office of Diversity and International Services hosted the following events: monthly forums (with trained facilitators) in recognition of months or days of heritage, history, and special holidays; safe spaces for Black, International and Latino/a and Latinx students ; the School of Law's strong commitment to advancing diversity initiatives , which continues to provide diversity an d inclusion student programming while engaging with student input and ideas . Additionally, to support the employees of UBalt with diversity dialogues, the JEDI (Justice, Equity, Diversity, Inclusion) series was created - a partnership between the Office of Human Resources and University Library. The second area highlighted is UBalt's ongoing a nd highly active faculty scholarship, a cademic courses and programs that support the essence of DEI principles. Examples for the AY 20 -21 programs include: the Fannie Angelos P rogram , which focuses on increas ing diversity in legal education through comprehensive preparation for interested graduates of Maryland's historically black colleges ; the Second Chance Pell Program, which provides higher education opportunity to incarcerated men, the majority of whom are pe rsons of color, and provid es advising and support to help the se individuals as they transition to degree completion ; the UB Community Fellows Program , which places graduate students in local community -based nonprofits to help them build capacity while also preparing students by engaging them in meaningful work ; and the Hoffberger Center for Professional Ethics , which sponsors events and panels that address relevant topics. Examples of exciting academically -centered activities include the addition of a new history course, \"Black Europe ,\" that will meet one of UBalt's Global and Diverse Perspectives graduation requirement. This history course recontextualizes European history to include the stories of persons of color , who have largely been ignored in histori cal narratives. Also, the outstanding work UB's Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance faculty continues as an international model for providing data on the deep diversity of the city and showing how that data demonstrates the impacts of policy on peop le. 4403. Describe how CVOID -19 affected efforts to enhance campus diversity (one page) ? During the COVID -19 pandemic, the UBalt's facilities were closed during AY 20 -21 to in -person instruction and offices operations , with the exception of some hybrid law clinics . The University remained open and operating in an online capacity for learning and remote working environment. As a result, UBalt's typically robust on-campus activities to enhance diversity were reduced, including its ongoing role as a central pl ace for the Baltimore City community to discuss timely topics in a safe, public for um. UBalt focused on other forms of communication for sharing diversity and inclusion matters , such as social media, email messaging, and website messaging. Keeping notices and information current was a challenge given the rapid changes occurring. But t he president and senior leadership team, governance groups, faculty, staff and students work ed together to strengthen and m aintain open and frequent lines of communication . Disappointing impacts of the pandemic on UBalt activities included a negative impact on the recruitment of international students who were directly affected by restrictions associated with the pandemic. Dual enrollment initiatives typically held in person at UB were offered online instead , and UB's diversely populated college summer prep program has been temporarily suspended (as of summer 2020). Despite the challenges and impact to UBalt's operation s, the pandemic did not deter UBalt's attention from enga ging in the nation's calls for solutions to social and racial injustice. As mentioned in response to question number two , the UBalt community held events where diversity, equity and inclusion were central and amplified topics for online programs and activi ties. The president issued campus -wide statements , faculty provided expertise to external requests for comments, articles were written and virtual campus discussion forums were held. More positive outcomes included UBalt's retention of its diverse student population , which held steady amid the pandemic's negative impact and the abrupt changes it brought to our learning environment. Overall, the University forged ahead with related organizational initiatives. UBalt reconstituted its campus wide diversity group into a newly formed, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) Committee that expeditiously orga nized itself and started producing meaningful results within a short timeframe , all achieved while being limited to a telework, virtual environment. The DEI committee champions diversity a nd inclusion topics from a campus -wide prospective. The UB Governance Steering Council appointed 18 members , given the high level of interest, inclu ding representative s from all corners of the UBalt community . The committee started its work in November 2020, established organizational systems for remote working , meetings, and communicating . They identified and agreed upon a refreshed platform for the committee 's vision, mission and principles based on the University 's existin g 2019 - 2023 Institutional P lan, and supportive of UB alt's current Strategic Plan , Goal 6. The committee recognized that the current Institutional Pl an's action items needed revisions with consideration of university priorities of today , as well as current national events . The members performed an initial audit of UBalt initiatives . Guided by a committee w orking document prepared by the co -chairs , the members are now on track to produce new, tailored action items to help UBalt fulfill time -sensitive priorities and needs working through five priority areas: student mentorship enhancement, student career advancement, faculty, staff and student ongoing education, communication and committee reporting and feedback . The plan is organized around short -term (6 month) and long -term action items for realizable results , with emphasis on student enrollment in addition to recruitment and retention of both students and employees . For UB, our institution's commitment to DEI is best represented through this inclusive, collaborative committee and its work. The University community supports this committee's efforts and its forthcoming plan through active participation and ongoing input . 4414. Appendix of Diversity Plan (Attachment) UB's 2019 -2023 diversity plan is attached. The Plan is iterative; therefore, the action items and timelines are currently under review by the University's DEI Committee for any necessary adjustments to keep the plan relevant and current. The DEI Committee is currently working on a revised action plan expected for approval by fall AY 2021 -22. A STRONG FOU NDATION: A STRATEGY FOR ENHANCING UB'S LEADERSHIP IN DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION FY 2019 - FY 2023 BACKGROUND and ALIGNMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S STRATEGIC PRIORITIES Stud ents, faculty and staff live and work in a world that is global, connected, and dive rse. As such, our individual and collectiv e responsibility is to foster understanding and acceptan ce of differ ences in race, ethnicity, culture, religion , preference, and ability. It is fo r this reason that th e University of Baltimore's strategic plan, Re-Imagining UB: 2018-2023 , has solidified its commitm ent to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The sixth goal of the plan states : \"UB fosters a diverse community of students, faculty , and staff. The experiences, perspectives, and contributions of all individuals are valued and deemed critical to intellectual growth. We will continue our commitment to supporting diverse ideas, experiences, and perspectives that strengthen professional, intellectual, and cultural agility.\" Integral to this goal is an insistence on academic rigor, accountability, and assessment coupled with an unwavering commitment to serve students from all backgrounds support ed by a highly diverse and qualified faculty and staff. A campus community rich in intellectual, cultural, and ethnic diversity promotes the exchange of ideas and knowledge, provides a profound learning experience for students, creates a better teaching and scholarly experience for faculty, leads to a more productive and supportive working experience for staff, and strengthens community engagement and outreach. Diversity is defined at UB in its fullest scope, embracing not only racial and ethnic groups and individuals who are or have been underrepresented in higher education, but also including religious affiliation, sexual orientation and gender identity, disability, foreign nationality, economic status, non-traditional student status, and other important characteristics. Inclusion describes the active, intentional, and ongoing engagement with diversity - in people, in the curriculum, in the co-curriculum, and i n communities (e.g. intellectual, social, cultural, geographic) with which individuals might connect. Creating a culture that is free from discrimination, appreciative of new ideas and capabilities, and is attentive to the need to deliver innovative, targeted and, as appropriate, corrective approaches to learning, teaching, research, and support services is central to UB's mission and success . Equally important is the preparation of our students to become resilient in leading and managing a diverse and changing workplace and society. This diversity plan, therefore, seeks to develop a strategic framework to identify and address practices and policies that are barriers to diversity, equity, and inclusion, particularly in the integral areas of student success and a diversified employee talent pool. In order to foster diversity and create inclusive excellence, the University embraces the following principles: 1.A shared understanding of a comprehensive, innovative, integrated approach to inclusivity in all aspects of university operations and a culture of shared responsibility, making all members of 443the university community integral to fostering the achievement of a diverse, equitable, supportive, and inclusive community. 2. A campus climate that acknowledges, welcomes, supports, and celebrates diversity, equity and inclusion among students, faculty and staff. 3. Recognizing that we are part of a global community, a commitment to strengthen and support programs and activities that promote cro ss-cultural understanding and global perspectives. 4. Diversifying the University's workforce through the development and implementation of a strategy for the recruitment, retention, and advancement of underrepresented and culturally competent faculty and staff. 5. The infusion of diversity-content in the academic curriculum and co-curricular programs. THE UNIVERSITY'S DIVERSITY PROFILE There has been significant racial and ethnic diversification in UB's student body over the last ten years. The number of undergraduate students who identify as one of the racial and ethnic groups that we count as underrepresented has increased from 63% to 68%, with African-American students now representing 48% of the undergradua te student body. Hiring and maintaining a diverse workforce remains one of the most difficult diversity-related challenges at the University, particularly in regard to tenure and tenure-track faculty, only 24 % are from underrepresented minorities. The st aff's racial and ethnic distribution largely reflects that of the State of Maryland. The racial and ethnic profile of our students, faculty, and staff is provided below. A. Student Demographics Enrollment at the University of Baltimore is the mo st diverse of Maryland 's public 4-year universities, as measured by the Campus Diversity Index1, attracting an exceptionally diverse student body relative to race and socio-economic circumstances. UB serves the working-age population of Baltimore and Maryland (average age for undergraduate students is 27; graduate, 32; and law 28) with a majority of students (90%) living in Maryland. Female students represent the majority of students ; 58% at the undergraduate level and 60% at the graduate level. The majority of students are Pell-eligible. There has been a remarkable increase in the percentage of undergraduate African American students from almost 35% in 2008 to 48% in 2017 . The percentage of Hispanic students remains small at less than four percent . Additionally, the percentage of students identifying as two or more races has increased to 4.6% in 2017, making it nearly as prevalent as the Hispanic (3.9%) and Asian (4.6%) populations . The growth in the percentage of African American students at the graduate level, while not as steep as the undergraduate level, still recorded remarkable gains from almost 22% in 2008 to approximately 39% in 2017, a 17% point gain. Tables 1A and 1B profile the racial and ethnic diversity of UB's undergraduate and gradua te student population over the last ten years, respectively. 1 UB's Diversity Index is 49.6% in Fall 2016. A score of 50% shows an equal balance among the racial groups; a score of 0% shows only a single racial group. Scores in Maryland public 4-year universities range from 5.2% to 49.6%. 444 Table 1A: Student Race and Ethnicity Report Undergraduate % Fall '08 Fall '12 or More and Ethnicity Report Graduate % Fall '08 Fall '12 or More Demographics The employment of African-American staff over the last 10 years has decreased slightly from 39.1% in 2008 to 36.5% in 2017. The staff racial and ethnic distribution largely reflects that of the State of Maryland. At 63%, female employees continue to fill the majority of staff roles. Table 2: Staff Race and Ethnicity Staff % Fall '08 Fall '12 Underrepresented minority groups represent 58 percent of UB's undergraduate a nd graduate student populations. As such, UB must do a better job of preparing and hiring more persons from these groups for faculty positions in order to provide diverse role models for our students. More compelling, however, is the argument that all students are better educated and better prepared for leadership, citizenship, and professional competitiveness when they are exposed to diverse perspectives in their classrooms. National data indicate that only 12% of the full-time faculty in U.S. degree granting universities are from underrepresented minorities (Digest of Educational Statistics, 2017). While the percent of underrepresented faculty at UB exceeds the national average, it is evident that more work needs to be done to more closely align the diversity of faculty to that of our students. Table 3A shows that less than 24% of tenured/tenure track (T/TT) faculty are from underrepresented groups. This percentage differs significantly across the academic divisions with minority faculty representing 54% of MSB faculty, 23% of CPA faculty, 16% of law faculty, 10% of CAS faculty, and 9% of Langsdale Librarians. African-Americans represent 8.4% of the T/TT faculty at UB, though this percentage varies across the university; 14% in CPA, 12% in law school, 8% in MSB, 5% in CAS and 1% in Langsdale Library. Table 3B, however, shows that the percentage of underrepresented faculty with other tenured status (i.e., adjunct, lecturers) saw a significant increase from 16.0% in 2008 to 35.8% in 2017. Continued diversification of our full-time and part-time faculty is an important goal moving forward . The faculty distribution by gender for the tenure/tenure track faculty has recorded significant changes. The percentage of female faculty increased from 36% in 2008 to 45% in 2017. Table 3A: Faculty Race and Ethnicity Tenured/Tenured Track # Fall '08 and Ethnicity Other Tenured Status Fall '08 Fall '12 GOALS AND STRATEGIES Although the University can point to numerous diversity and inclusion indicators of success, its goal is to be an innovative diversity leader within the University System of Maryland. To support this objective, five goals have been established. The first is to intentionally create a University that is respectful of differences and inclusive of all people. The second commits the University to strengthening faculty diversity, given the disparity between the profile of students and tenure/tenure-track faculty. Ensuring that UB's staff profile continues to reflect the diversity of Maryland's demographics is th e cornerstone of the third goal. The fourth goal focuses on improving inclusivity by incorporating diversity and inclusion in significant ways in teaching, learning, and research and support services. The final goal builds on UB's legacy of community engagement by building upon existing partnerships with community and alumni to enhance the University's commitment to and work with diverse populations. Implementation of the plan will begin AY 2018-19, continuing through AY 2022-23. Senior leadership, in collaboration with the campus community, will establish annual priorities from this plan. Goal 1: Intentionally foster and sustain a welcoming campus environment based on the principles of equity and inclusion to create an environment that is respectful of differences and promotes the safety and security of all people. Strategy 1: Build and maintain an infrastructure that supports and promotes inclusion Assign the Director of the Diversity and Culture Center and the University Culture and Diversity Committee with the responsibility to sustain diversity and inclusion initiatives and support the implementation and monitoring of the diversity and inclusion plan. Analyze USM Data Journal and Maryland demographic data annually to assess achievement of goals to diversify faculty and staff, and develop metrics and trend data to monitor progress . Enhance the physical and technological infrastructure to provide accessibility for all members. Update existing, and create new, university procedures and policies to better meet the needs of students, faculty and staff in underrepresented groups that are not well-served by current systems. Develop a healthier, collegial working environment through better communication of and training in system, university and college-level policies; ensure mandatory training for all supervisors and academic leaders (e.g., deans, chairs, directors). Identify Ombudsperson(s) to serve as an impartial intermediary to mediate disputes and investigate and address complaints. Strategy 2: Develop quantitative and qualitative metrics to better understand the state of diversity and inclusion at UB. Assess UB with regard to the Multicultural Organization Development Model2 and identify areas of deficiencies. Design and conduct periodic campus-wide climate surveys (faculty, staff and students) to frame and direct future action on diversity and inclusion. 2 Jackson, B.W. (2006). Theory and practice of multicultural organizational development. In Jones, B.B. & Brazzel, M. (Eds.), The NTL Handbook of Organizational Development and Change (pp. 139-154). San Francisco, CA, Pfeiffer. 447 Strategy 3 : Initiate cultural competence training for UB faculty, staff, and students. Cultural competence is a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes , and policies that enable one to function effecti vely across cultural difference while being respectful and responsive to the beliefs of diverse population groups. Include training in onboarding processes and/or orientation of new faculty, staff, and student employees. Offer training through Human Resource Training and Development Program or CELTT for existing faculty and staff on topics ranging from recognizing and reducing implicit bias in the application review process to best practices for inclusive interviewing and mentoring. Offer training via New Student Orientation of new students and via Student Affairs activities and programming for existing students. Train UB management and supervisory personnel in best practices that promote diversity and inclusiveness across all functions. Include training on the process for reporting hate crime and UB's response protocol in the onboarding of new faculty and staff, and the orientation for all new students. Incorporate informal and formal diversity, equity , and inclusion goals into Performance Management Process (PMP) and provide feedback regarding individual and unit -level d iversity efforts and struggles. Strategy 4: Address gains, opportunities, and challenges of becoming a diverse campus by providing \"Our UB Students\" data and information. Information will provide a narrative beyond demographic data to enhance knowledge of UB students' unique backgrounds, histories and lived experiences. Include student data and information in recruitment profiles and interview documents. Provide student data and information during New Faculty and Staff Orientation. Offer student data and information through Human Resource Training and Development Program. Offer student data and information as a part of CELTT professional development series. Offer student data and information through Student Affairs activities and trainings. Strategy 5: Promote a more inclusive and welcoming environment. Add 'Preferred' name to class and grade roster through the revision of the formal \"Name Change\" form . Create online resource for transitioning individuals and their allies. Conduct physical inventory to create, identify and promote gender-neutral restrooms, private rooms for lactating mothers, space for meditation/prayer, etc. Foster an atmosphere of linguistic inclusion that empowers multilingual students to speak and write without ridicule and supports them as they attempt to expand their language acquisition. Find sustainable ways to support parents as they strive to advance their education. 448Goal 2: Recruit, employ, and retain a diverse faculty Strategy 1: Expand outreach to build applicant pool Hold an adjunct Job Fair to promote teaching opportunities. In conjunction with the USM PROMISE initiative, host an Annual Preparing Future Faculty Institute for underrepresented doctoral students and postdoctoral students from USM institutions who wish to pursue careers in the professoriate. Attend fairs and conferences frequented by underrepresented faculty candidates (e.g., Compact for Faculty Diversity, the Leadership Alliance). Develop a collegial mentoring initiative for adjuncts of underrepresented background in effort to transition some into full-time positions at the university or elsewhere. Create courses and programs that support scholarship in diverse areas, such as Women and Gender Studies, African American Studies, Critical Race Theory, etc. Strategy 2: Develop focused recruitment plans t o increase the percentage of faculty fro m underrepresented groups by 35 percent within five years. In conjunction with faculty leadership, engage faculty in authentic discussions around diversity and inclusion to identify priorities and opportunities for building a more inclusive culture. Developing a clear and consistent message to administration, faculty, and staff that having a diverse workforce is an institutional priority; therefore each division will develop a plan to increase diversity approved by the Dean and Provost. Use strategic advertisement and identify outlets to maximize diversity in candidate pools and provide needed resources for expanded targeted recruitment (e.g., Diverse Issues in Higher Education, Hispanic Outlook). Enhance training for search committees, including mandatory diversity recruitment training and implicit bias training and, when appropriate, include student representation on search committees. Develop and include diversity statement and definition in job descriptions. Require applicants to submit a brief statement reflecting their commitment to diversity and inclusivene ss. Create shared evaluation criteria for application review, interviews, and campus visits. Strategy 3: Improve transition of underrepresented faculty to foster a smooth and welcoming entry into the University and campus community. Pair a new hire with early mentoring before arrival to campus; assign mentor immediately after hire. Develop an 'on -boarding program' to facilitate sense of belonging and community by helping new hire build connections in community (e.g., housing support, childcare resources, locate potential religious community). Reframe New Faculty Orientation and include quarterly meetings. 449Strategy 3: Develop a faculty retention and advancement plan for women and underrepresented groups Educate chairs, program directors, and faculty mentors to ensure support for female and other underrepresented faculty groups. Secure funding for Welcome Fellowship Grants: A competitive fellowship program for new tenure-track faculty from underrepresented groups. Each award provides $10,000 to support the faculty member's research and scholarship over their first three years as an Assistant Professor. Secure funding to attract visiting scholars from underrepresented groups. Offer targeted professional development workshops, which focus on issues of interest to underrepresented faculty. Develop a leadership training program for recently tenured and promoted faculty to support their advancement in their professions and in the academy. Develop a University Faculty Award that recognizes faculty engagement in research, creative expression and/or service to promote diversity, equity, justice, and inclusion. Goal 3: Recruit and retain a diverse workforce and e nsure that UB's staff profile reflects the diversity of Maryland's demographics. Strategy 1: Develop a staff diversity recruitment and retention plan Developing a clear and consistent message to administration, faculty, and staff that having a diverse workforce an institutional priority, therefore each division will develop a plan to increase diversity. Enhance training for search committees, including mandatory diversity recruitment training and implicit bias training. Include diversity statement and definition in job descriptions. Enhance recruitment plans to expand the number of qualified minorities in applicant pools. Strategy 2: Develop a retention and advancement plan for underrepresented groups Find and create opportunities for career advancement and professional development of women and members of underrepresented groups, such as succession planning, job shadowing, interim appointments, and mentoring. Offer enhanced coaching and advice regarding career opportunities, planning and development. Develop a University Staff Award that recognizes staff efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Support the professional development of staff at a level of parity with faculty development. Goal 4: Prepare our students to lead and manage in a diverse and changing society by incorporating diversity and inclusion in significant ways in teaching, learning, and research Strategy 1: Support continued development of curriculum and service that address issues of structural diversity, equity, and inclusion. Recognize diversity and inclusion contributions in annual performance evaluations for all. 450 CELTT will sponsor a series on culturally responsive and inclusive teaching and employment of relevant pedagogy. Evaluate other mechanisms to promote diversity (e.g., Diversity and Inclusion Certificate, online resources to share successful inclusive teaching strategies; \"Difficult Dialogues\" series) . Support the development of courses that meet the diversity and global perspectives requirement. Develop applied research opportunities in collaboration with university partners to provide meaningful undergraduate and graduate research opportunities based upon diverse communities. Strategy 2: Build on co-curricular programming that engages campus community members in the challenges and rewards of valuing diversity. Support capacity building and high-quality training for professionals who work in student services. Strengthen and expand student leadership training related to diversity, equity, and inclusion; and explore the development of a USM badge. Redesign the current student organization training to include a diversity and inclusion module that will address diversity from a broad perspectiv e. Strategy 3: Monitor and continue to invest in closing the achievement gap and increasing the retention and graduation rates of underrepresented groups in undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree programs. (Note: See Student Success Plan for details) Goal 5 : Build upon existing partnerships and create new partnerships that enhance the University's commitment to and work with diverse populations Strategy 1: Work to develop opportunities for alumni to contribute in multiple ways to increase access, cultivate a culture of inclusive learning, support systemic transformation, and strengthen relationships with alumni from underrepresented groups. Acknowledge and affirm the diversity of experiences among UB alumni, including injustices in need of reconciliation. Implement inclusive customer service training for all staff members to equip them with tools to support prospective students and community members from all identities and backgrounds. Build institutional identity among underrepresented students as future UB alumni and support and strengthen mentorship opportunities for alumni and students. Develop active affinity groups and cultivate alumni financial giving culture that enhances diversity efforts. Strategy 2: Enhance partnerships with local organizations to provide information and community resource materials to new faculty, administrators, and staff that may address the needs of potential employers (e.g., employment opportunities for spouse/partners, housing, religious affiliation, and soci al integration in the region). Strategy 3: Build B-Power initiative to intentionally provide greater access to higher education to students from underrepresented groups. 451THE UNIVERSITY OF BALTIMORE BUILDING ON A STRONG FOU NDATION: A STRATEGY FOR ENHANCING UB'S LEADERSHIP IN DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION FY 2019 - FY 2023 BACKGROUND and ALIGNMENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S STRATEGIC PRIORITIES Stud ents, faculty and staff live and work in a world that is global, connected, and dive rse. As such, our individual and collectiv e responsibility is to foster understanding and acceptan ce of differ ences in race, ethnicity, culture, religion , preference, and ability. It is fo r this reason that th e University of Baltimore's strategic plan, Re-Imagining UB: 2018-2023 , has solidified its commitm ent to diversity, equity, and inclusion. The sixth goal of the plan states : \"UB fosters a diverse community of students, faculty , and staff. The experiences, perspectives, and contributions of all individuals are valued and deemed critical to intellectual growth. We will continue our commitment to supporting diverse ideas, experiences, and perspectives that strengthen professional, intellectual, and cultural agility.\" Integral to this goal is an insistence on academic rigor, accountability, and assessment coupled with an unwavering commitment to serve students from all backgrounds support ed by a highly diverse and qualified faculty and staff. A campus community rich in intellectual, cultural, and ethnic diversity promotes the exchange of ideas and knowledge, provides a profound learning experience for students, creates a better teaching and scholarly experience for faculty, leads to a more productive and supportive working experience for staff, and strengthens community engagement and outreach. Diversity is defined at UB in its fullest scope, embracing not only racial and ethnic groups and individuals who are or have been underrepresented in higher education, but also including religious affiliation, sexual orientation and gender identity, disability, foreign nationality, economic status, non-traditional student status, and other important characteristics. Inclusion describes the active, intentional, and ongoing engagement with diversity - in people, in the curriculum, in the co-curriculum, and i n communities (e.g. intellectual, social, cultural, geographic) with which individuals might connect. Creating a culture that is free from discrimination, appreciative of new ideas and capabilities, and is attentive to the need to deliver innovative, targeted and, as appropriate, corrective approaches to learning, teaching, research, and support services is central to UB's mission and success . Equally important is the preparation of our students to become resilient in leading and managing a diverse and changing workplace and society. This diversity plan, therefore, seeks to develop a strategic framework to identify and address practices and policies that are barriers to diversity, equity, and inclusion, particularly in the integral areas of student success and a diversified employee talent pool. In order to foster diversity and create inclusive excellence, the University embraces the following principles: 1.A shared understanding of a comprehensive, innovative, integrated approach to inclusivity in all aspects of university operations and a culture of shared responsibility, making all members of 452the university community integral to fostering the achievement of a diverse, equitable, supportive, and inclusive community. 2. A campus climate that acknowledges, welcomes, supports, and celebrates diversity, equity and inclusion among students, faculty and staff. 3. Recognizing that we are part of a global community, a commitment to strengthen and support programs and activities that promote cro ss-cultural understanding and global perspectives. 4. Diversifying the University's workforce through the development and implementation of a strategy for the recruitment, retention, and advancement of underrepresented and culturally competent faculty and staff. 5. The infusion of diversity-content in the academic curriculum and co-curricular programs. THE UNIVERSITY'S DIVERSITY PROFILE There has been significant racial and ethnic diversification in UB's student body over the last ten years. The number of undergraduate students who identify as one of the racial and ethnic groups that we count as underrepresented has increased from 63% to 68%, with African-American students now representing 48% of the undergradua te student body. Hiring and maintaining a diverse workforce remains one of the most difficult diversity-related challenges at the University, particularly in regard to tenure and tenure-track faculty, only 24 % are from underrepresented minorities. The st aff's racial and ethnic distribution largely reflects that of the State of Maryland. The racial and ethnic profile of our students, faculty, and staff is provided below. A. Student Demographics Enrollment at the University of Baltimore is the mo st diverse of Maryland 's public 4-year universities, as measured by the Campus Diversity Index1, attracting an exceptionally diverse student body relative to race and socio-economic circumstances. UB serves the working-age population of Baltimore and Maryland (average age for undergraduate students is 27; graduate, 32; and law 28) with a majority of students (90%) living in Maryland. Female students represent the majority of students ; 58% at the undergraduate level and 60% at the graduate level. The majority of students are Pell-eligible. There has been a remarkable increase in the percentage of undergraduate African American students from almost 35% in 2008 to 48% in 2017 . The percentage of Hispanic students remains small at less than four percent . Additionally, the percentage of students identifying as two or more races has increased to 4.6% in 2017, making it nearly as prevalent as the Hispanic (3.9%) and Asian (4.6%) populations . The growth in the percentage of African American students at the graduate level, while not as steep as the undergraduate level, still recorded remarkable gains from almost 22% in 2008 to approximately 39% in 2017, a 17% point gain. Tables 1A and 1B profile the racial and ethnic diversity of UB's undergraduate and gradua te student population over the last ten years, respectively. 1 UB's Diversity Index is 49.6% in Fall 2016. A score of 50% shows an equal balance among the racial groups; a score of 0% shows only a single racial group. Scores in Maryland public 4-year universities range from 5.2% to 49.6%. 453 Table 1A: Student Race and Ethnicity Report Undergraduate % Fall '08 Fall '12 or More and Ethnicity Report Graduate % Fall '08 Fall '12 or More Demographics The employment of African-American staff over the last 10 years has decreased slightly from 39.1% in 2008 to 36.5% in 2017. The staff racial and ethnic distribution largely reflects that of the State of Maryland. At 63%, female employees continue to fill the majority of staff roles. Table 2: Staff Race and Ethnicity Staff % Fall '08 Fall '12 Underrepresented minority groups represent 58 percent of UB's undergraduate a nd graduate student populations. As such, UB must do a better job of preparing and hiring more persons from these groups for faculty positions in order to provide diverse role models for our students. More compelling, however, is the argument that all students are better educated and better prepared for leadership, citizenship, and professional competitiveness when they are exposed to diverse perspectives in their classrooms. National data indicate that only 12% of the full-time faculty in U.S. degree granting universities are from underrepresented minorities (Digest of Educational Statistics, 2017). While the percent of underrepresented faculty at UB exceeds the national average, it is evident that more work needs to be done to more closely align the diversity of faculty to that of our students. Table 3A shows that less than 24% of tenured/tenure track (T/TT) faculty are from underrepresented groups. This percentage differs significantly across the academic divisions with minority faculty representing 54% of MSB faculty, 23% of CPA faculty, 16% of law faculty, 10% of CAS faculty, and 9% of Langsdale Librarians. African-Americans represent 8.4% of the T/TT faculty at UB, though this percentage varies across the university; 14% in CPA, 12% in law school, 8% in MSB, 5% in CAS and 1% in Langsdale Library. Table 3B, however, shows that the percentage of underrepresented faculty with other tenured status (i.e., adjunct, lecturers) saw a significant increase from 16.0% in 2008 to 35.8% in 2017. Continued diversification of our full-time and part-time faculty is an important goal moving forward . The faculty distribution by gender for the tenure/tenure track faculty has recorded significant changes. The percentage of female faculty increased from 36% in 2008 to 45% in 2017. Table 3A: Faculty Race and Ethnicity Tenured/Tenured Track # Fall '08 and Ethnicity Other Tenured Status Fall '08 Fall '12 GOALS AND STRATEGIES Although the University can point to numerous diversity and inclusion indicators of success, its goal is to be an innovative diversity leader within the University System of Maryland. To support this objective, five goals have been established. The first is to intentionally create a University that is respectful of differences and inclusive of all people. The second commits the University to strengthening faculty diversity, given the disparity between the profile of students and tenure/tenure-track faculty. Ensuring that UB's staff profile continues to reflect the diversity of Maryland's demographics is th e cornerstone of the third goal. The fourth goal focuses on improving inclusivity by incorporating diversity and inclusion in significant ways in teaching, learning, and research and support services. The final goal builds on UB's legacy of community engagement by building upon existing partnerships with community and alumni to enhance the University's commitment to and work with diverse populations. Implementation of the plan will begin AY 2018-19, continuing through AY 2022-23. Senior leadership, in collaboration with the campus community, will establish annual priorities from this plan. Goal 1: Intentionally foster and sustain a welcoming campus environment based on the principles of equity and inclusion to create an environment that is respectful of differences and promotes the safety and security of all people. Strategy 1: Build and maintain an infrastructure that supports and promotes inclusion Assign the Director of the Diversity and Culture Center and the University Culture and Diversity Committee with the responsibility to sustain diversity and inclusion initiatives and support the implementation and monitoring of the diversity and inclusion plan. Analyze USM Data Journal and Maryland demographic data annually to assess achievement of goals to diversify faculty and staff, and develop metrics and trend data to monitor progress . Enhance the physical and technological infrastructure to provide accessibility for all members. Update existing, and create new, university procedures and policies to better meet the needs of students, faculty and staff in underrepresented groups that are not well-served by current systems. Develop a healthier, collegial working environment through better communication of and training in system, university and college-level policies; ensure mandatory training for all supervisors and academic leaders (e.g., deans, chairs, directors). Identify Ombudsperson(s) to serve as an impartial intermediary to mediate disputes and investigate and address complaints. Strategy 2: Develop quantitative and qualitative metrics to better understand the state of diversity and inclusion at UB. Assess UB with regard to the Multicultural Organization Development Model2 and identify areas of deficiencies. Design and conduct periodic campus-wide climate surveys (faculty, staff and students) to frame and direct future action on diversity and inclusion. 2 Jackson, B.W. (2006). Theory and practice of multicultural organizational development. In Jones, B.B. & Brazzel, M. (Eds.), The NTL Handbook of Organizational Development and Change (pp. 139-154). San Francisco, CA, Pfeiffer. 456 Strategy 3 : Initiate cultural competence training for UB faculty, staff, and students. Cultural competence is a set of congruent behaviors, attitudes , and policies that enable one to function effecti vely across cultural difference while being respectful and responsive to the beliefs of diverse population groups. Include training in onboarding processes and/or orientation of new faculty, staff, and student employees. Offer training through Human Resource Training and Development Program or CELTT for existing faculty and staff on topics ranging from recognizing and reducing implicit bias in the application review process to best practices for inclusive interviewing and mentoring. Offer training via New Student Orientation of new students and via Student Affairs activities and programming for existing students. Train UB management and supervisory personnel in best practices that promote diversity and inclusiveness across all functions. Include training on the process for reporting hate crime and UB's response protocol in the onboarding of new faculty and staff, and the orientation for all new students. Incorporate informal and formal diversity, equity , and inclusion goals into Performance Management Process (PMP) and provide feedback regarding individual and unit -level d iversity efforts and struggles. Strategy 4: Address gains, opportunities, and challenges of becoming a diverse campus by providing \"Our UB Students\" data and information. Information will provide a narrative beyond demographic data to enhance knowledge of UB students' unique backgrounds, histories and lived experiences. Include student data and information in recruitment profiles and interview documents. Provide student data and information during New Faculty and Staff Orientation. Offer student data and information through Human Resource Training and Development Program. Offer student data and information as a part of CELTT professional development series. Offer student data and information through Student Affairs activities and trainings. Strategy 5: Promote a more inclusive and welcoming environment. Add 'Preferred' name to class and grade roster through the revision of the formal \"Name Change\" form . Create online resource for transitioning individuals and their allies. Conduct physical inventory to create, identify and promote gender-neutral restrooms, private rooms for lactating mothers, space for meditation/prayer, etc. Foster an atmosphere of linguistic inclusion that empowers multilingual students to speak and write without ridicule and supports them as they attempt to expand their language acquisition. Find sustainable ways to support parents as they strive to advance their education. 457Goal 2: Recruit, employ, and retain a diverse faculty Strategy 1: Expand outreach to build applicant pool Hold an adjunct Job Fair to promote teaching opportunities. In conjunction with the USM PROMISE initiative, host an Annual Preparing Future Faculty Institute for underrepresented doctoral students and postdoctoral students from USM institutions who wish to pursue careers in the professoriate. Attend fairs and conferences frequented by underrepresented faculty candidates (e.g., Compact for Faculty Diversity, the Leadership Alliance). Develop a collegial mentoring initiative for adjuncts of underrepresented background in effort to transition some into full-time positions at the university or elsewhere. Create courses and programs that support scholarship in diverse areas, such as Women and Gender Studies, African American Studies, Critical Race Theory, etc. Strategy 2: Develop focused recruitment plans t o increase the percentage of faculty fro m underrepresented groups by 35 percent within five years. In conjunction with faculty leadership, engage faculty in authentic discussions around diversity and inclusion to identify priorities and opportunities for building a more inclusive culture. Developing a clear and consistent message to administration, faculty, and staff that having a diverse workforce is an institutional priority; therefore each division will develop a plan to increase diversity approved by the Dean and Provost. Use strategic advertisement and identify outlets to maximize diversity in candidate pools and provide needed resources for expanded targeted recruitment (e.g., Diverse Issues in Higher Education, Hispanic Outlook). Enhance training for search committees, including mandatory diversity recruitment training and implicit bias training and, when appropriate, include student representation on search committees. Develop and include diversity statement and definition in job descriptions. Require applicants to submit a brief statement reflecting their commitment to diversity and inclusivene ss. Create shared evaluation criteria for application review, interviews, and campus visits. Strategy 3: Improve transition of underrepresented faculty to foster a smooth and welcoming entry into the University and campus community. Pair a new hire with early mentoring before arrival to campus; assign mentor immediately after hire. Develop an 'on -boarding program' to facilitate sense of belonging and community by helping new hire build connections in community (e.g., housing support, childcare resources, locate potential religious community). Reframe New Faculty Orientation and include quarterly meetings. 458Strategy 3: Develop a faculty retention and advancement plan for women and underrepresented groups Educate chairs, program directors, and faculty mentors to ensure support for female and other underrepresented faculty groups. Secure funding for Welcome Fellowship Grants: A competitive fellowship program for new tenure-track faculty from underrepresented groups. Each award provides $10,000 to support the faculty member's research and scholarship over their first three years as an Assistant Professor. Secure funding to attract visiting scholars from underrepresented groups. Offer targeted professional development workshops, which focus on issues of interest to underrepresented faculty. Develop a leadership training program for recently tenured and promoted faculty to support their advancement in their professions and in the academy. Develop a University Faculty Award that recognizes faculty engagement in research, creative expression and/or service to promote diversity, equity, justice, and inclusion. Goal 3: Recruit and retain a diverse workforce and e nsure that UB's staff profile reflects the diversity of Maryland's demographics. Strategy 1: Develop a staff diversity recruitment and retention plan Developing a clear and consistent message to administration, faculty, and staff that having a diverse workforce an institutional priority, therefore each division will develop a plan to increase diversity. Enhance training for search committees, including mandatory diversity recruitment training and implicit bias training. Include diversity statement and definition in job descriptions. Enhance recruitment plans to expand the number of qualified minorities in applicant pools. Strategy 2: Develop a retention and advancement plan for underrepresented groups Find and create opportunities for career advancement and professional development of women and members of underrepresented groups, such as succession planning, job shadowing, interim appointments, and mentoring. Offer enhanced coaching and advice regarding career opportunities, planning and development. Develop a University Staff Award that recognizes staff efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Support the professional development of staff at a level of parity with faculty development. Goal 4: Prepare our students to lead and manage in a diverse and changing society by incorporating diversity and inclusion in significant ways in teaching, learning, and research Strategy 1: Support continued development of curriculum and service that address issues of structural diversity, equity, and inclusion. Recognize diversity and inclusion contributions in annual performance evaluations for all. 459 CELTT will sponsor a series on culturally responsive and inclusive teaching and employment of relevant pedagogy. Evaluate other mechanisms to promote diversity (e.g., Diversity and Inclusion Certificate, online resources to share successful inclusive teaching strategies; \"Difficult Dialogues\" series) . Support the development of courses that meet the diversity and global perspectives requirement. Develop applied research opportunities in collaboration with university partners to provide meaningful undergraduate and graduate research opportunities based upon diverse communities. Strategy 2: Build on co-curricular programming that engages campus community members in the challenges and rewards of valuing diversity. Support capacity building and high-quality training for professionals who work in student services. Strengthen and expand student leadership training related to diversity, equity, and inclusion; and explore the development of a USM badge. Redesign the current student organization training to include a diversity and inclusion module that will address diversity from a broad perspectiv e. Strategy 3: Monitor and continue to invest in closing the achievement gap and increasing the retention and graduation rates of underrepresented groups in undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree programs. (Note: See Student Success Plan for details) Goal 5 : Build upon existing partnerships and create new partnerships that enhance the University's commitment to and work with diverse populations Strategy 1: Work to develop opportunities for alumni to contribute in multiple ways to increase access, cultivate a culture of inclusive learning, support systemic transformation, and strengthen relationships with alumni from underrepresented groups. Acknowledge and affirm the diversity of experiences among UB alumni, including injustices in need of reconciliation. Implement inclusive customer service training for all staff members to equip them with tools to support prospective students and community members from all identities and backgrounds. Build institutional identity among underrepresented students as future UB alumni and support and strengthen mentorship opportunities for alumni and students. Develop active affinity groups and cultivate alumni financial giving culture that enhances diversity efforts. Strategy 2: Enhance partnerships with local organizations to provide information and community resource materials to new faculty, administrators, and staff that may address the needs of potential employers (e.g., employment opportunities for spouse/partners, housing, religious affiliation, and soci al integration in the region). Strategy 3: Build B-Power initiative to intentionally provide greater access to higher education to students from underrepresented groups. 460 UNIVERSIT Y OF MARYLAND , BALTIMORE 461UMB - Spring 2021 Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Report - Page 1 University of Maryland, Baltimore Spring 2021 Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Report April 12, 2021 1. A description of how the institution defines diversity (no more than one page ); how did the institution develop that definition (e.g., processes, sources, and guidance used)? Diversity is a UMB Core Value. The University is committed to a culture enriched by diversity and inclusion, in the broadest sense, in its thoughts, actions, and leadership. The University is engaging in an inclusive process to update the Core Values as a part of the 202 2-2026 Strategic Planning process. In 2020, UMB convened a workgroup, counseled by Norman Augustine, former Chairman and CEO of the Lockheed Martin Corporation board, to review the core values before the planning process commenced. Mr. Augustine's efforts also include advising the 2019 -2020 President's Fellows on developing a white paper exploring how to institutionalize the core values into the UMB culture. A subgroup of the Diversity Advisory Council (DAC) developed a statement on cultural competence . The original purpose of the statement was to develop a common definition across the university . The subgroup used the definition of cultural competence established by the National Association of Social Work's (NASW) National Committee (2001) and endorsed b y the NASW standards of \"cultural competence\" in social work practice, with some small modifications. In November 2018, the Deans discussed the statement on cultural competence developed by the subgroup. The subgroup considered the feedback and shared the new draft with the DAC in February 2019. The following is the final statement on cultural competence adopted: The University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB) is committed and pledges to embrace cultural competence at all organizational levels and programs to improve outcomes for students, faculty, staff, and the community at large. \"Cultural competence responds respectfully and effectively to all people in a manner that recognizes, affirms, and values the worth of individuals, families, and communities and protects and preserves the dignity of each (all).\"1 The University will develop policies and engage in education, scholarship, and service delivery that promote and support cultural knowledge, s kills, and attitudes. Together as a university community we commit to self -assessing and strengthening our own cultural competence by creating a climate that celebrates diversity and inclusion. We propose that as a university we engage in the following ac tivities to be able to implement this statement and achieve its purpose and outcomes: 1. Develop a process to engage each school at the leadership level and as a whole to implement and execute this statement within their respective schools. 2. Encourage the Cen ter for Interprofessional Education (IPE) to develop IPE experiences for students of all schools in the area of cultural competence. 3. Create a clear message to the University community about this statement and the expectations for each member of the organiz ation. 1 This is the definition of cultural competence by the National Association of Social Work's (NASW) National Committee (2001) and endorsed by the NASW standards of \"cultural competence\" in social work practice with some small modifications. 462UMB - Spring 2021 Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Report - Page 2 2. A brief (no more than one page ) highlight of the most successful ongoing and new institutional initiatives designed to address issues related to cultural diversity within the campus and the broader community and how their efficacy is measured; UMB conducted a national search for its inaugural chief diversity, equity, and inclusion offic er. Reporting to the president, the CDEIO/VP will begin on July 1 to serve as an advisor, leader, and catalyst for institutional change focused on diver sity, equity , and inclusion . In June 2020, UMB established an Intercultural Center and hired an inaugural Executive Director based on University task force recommendations. The Center provide s support for students from marginalized and underrepresented communities a nd co-curricular experiences that positively influence students' cultural knowledge, skills, and attitudes and the U MB community. In summer 2020, the School of Social Work hired an inaugural Assistant Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and established an Office for Diversity, Equity , and Inclusion to build and foster diversity, equity, inclusion, social justice, anti-racism, anti -discrimination, restoration, reconciliation, and acce ssibility . The Graduate School established an inaugural Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in July 2020 , and appoint ed an inaugu ral Chief Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Officer in spring 2021. In March 2021, the Graduate School received approval from the Board of Regents to offer a Master of Science in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Leadership (MS -DEIL), the first in Maryland. The program will be an extensio n of the existing Intercultural Leadership post- baccalaureate certificate (PBC) , established in fall 20 19. The MS -DEIL will consist of 11 courses for 31 credits and will launch in fall 2022. A New Center of Excellence on LGBTQ+ Behavioral Health Equity launched in spring 2021 out of the Institute for Innovation & Implementation in Social Work , provid ing health care practitioners with best and evidence- based practices and strategies that reduce disparities among the LGBTQ+ population across mental health and substance use disord er treatment. Grant funded by U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. The Diversity Advisory Council advises University leadership and consists of representatives across each School and the central administrative units. . The DAC established an Anti-Racism Action Committee in summer 2020. The School of Social Work, HeartSmiles, and the Black Mental Health Alliance collaborate to offer the Healing Youth Alliance to work with youth from the community to teach them about Healing Centered Engagement, the African Philosophy of Ubuntu, Trauma, and Mental Health in the African American Community. Several students met with President Biden's team to discuss issues facing today's youth. In fall 2020, t he Communit y Engageme nt Center relocated to a fully renovated historic property in the Hollins Market neighborhood to expand programming space by more than seven times the original location. Additional staff hired to increase the effectiveness of engaging neighbors t hroughout Southwest and West Baltimore. Programs, services, support, training, and activities center on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Nursing received the 2020 Health Professions Higher Education Excellence in Diversity Award from INSIGHT Into Diversity magazine in recognition of annual learning objectives focused on cultural competence, education , and training included in faculty and staff performance reviews, integration of Restorati ve Justice practices , and facilitating dialogue and cultural and racial awareness through a Booked for Lunch Club. UMB CURE (Continuing Umbrella of Research Experiences Program) Scholars , launched in fall 2015, is a comprehensive science pipeline initiative that excites students from three middle schools in the unde rserved neighborhoods of West Baltimore about science and exposes them to careers in health care, cancer research, and STEM. UMB CURE d iffers from the National Cancer Institute's CURE Program, from which it was modeled and originally funded, by engaging students early in their academic caree rs - beginning in 6th grade through college. UMB CURE has an annual student retention rate of over 9 2%, a weekly after -school attendance rate over 85% , and Saturday attendance rate of 78% . The program improved standardized math scores for 80% of the participants. In fall 2020 , all Social Work students required completion of the Structural Oppression and Its Implications for Social Work course, encouraging students to understand the causes, impacts, and strategies that address all forms of structural oppression based on race, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, ability , etc. The Francis King Carey School of Law received a $5 million gift from biotech entrepreneurs Marco and Debbie Chac\u00f3n to establish the Chac\u00f3n Center for Immigrant Justice, dedicated to improving immigrants' lives and their families while providing invaluable training for future lawyers. Efficacy measured using varying methods, including quantitative and qualitative assessments and evaluations, and the achievement of priorities and learning outcomes . 463UMB - Spring 2021 Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Report - Page 3 3. A brief (no more than one page ) discussion of the ways in which the institution anticipates COVID -19 most affecting - either negatively or positively - efforts to enhance diversity on campus. This may include, for example, acknowledgement of issues such as disproportionate impacts on ret ention and graduation among certain populations; the shift to distance education modalities limiting the ability to provide in-person programming; or, in contrast, the shift to online education providing opportunity for more students to access diversit y programming. Positive Impacts: Increased access due to the School of Medicine holding virtual admissions interviews. Not having travel and lodging barriers allowed for b roader diversity of applicants . Will consider virtual interviews in the future . Targeted admissions events held with HBCU's across the country. School of Medicine applicants would typically choose between attending the diversity dinner and the first look day due to personal financial constraints. Virtual events enabled students to particip ate in all events. Teaching online in the School of Dentistry allowed for diverse speakers with varying backgrounds, views , and geographic locations (e.g., Canada, Brazil, UK, NJ, FL ) in the virtual classroom . Graduation numbers do not show a decline. The pandemic has not seemed to negatively affect retention or graduat ion of students. Virtual academic experiences provided flexibility and helped decrease inequities for students who are parents or caregivers. P aying for or identifying care became less of an issue . Technology increase d student access due to the use of subtitles, captioning , and recording classes/events. In December 2020, UMB worked with the University of Maryland Medical Sys tem to open a clinic in the SMC Campus Cent er for health care workers and other front -line personnel to receive COVID -19 vaccination s beginning January 6. In March 2021, UMB took full responsibility for continuing the vaccine clinic . Key campus leaders included the Office of Emergency Management, School of Nursing, Student Affairs, School of Pharmacy, and Legal Affairs. UMB proactively contacted t he Baltimore City Health Department (BCHD) to express our intention to serve UMB's neighbors and get as many people vaccinated as possible. UMB is now vaccinating Baltimore City residents referred by BCHD and eligible faculty, staff, and students from UMB. UMB is instrumental in vaccinating the community through partnerships, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Se rvices, the Esperanza Center to reach Spanish -speaking individuals, and the Indian Health Service to reach Native American s. Over 30,000 vaccines administered at UMB thus far. UMB collaborated with Comcast to provide internet service for up to 1,000 famil ies from 14 different partner schools in West Baltimore for one year , beginning fall 2020. Since the end of September, UMB used its community school coordinators to contact families from its 14 partne r schools. UMB and Comcast identified around 600 families needing internet access and provided a self -installation kit. This collaboration resulted in the families setting up a router in their home safely . UM B hopes to expand this partnership with Comcast and is exploring opportunities to bring internet access to senior citizens in the community and extend the sponsorship beyond one year of coverage. A DAC representative appointed to each COVID -19 focus area . A COVID -19 diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) workgroup established to prioritize DEI during planning and response. Prioritize d UMB as a family -friendly institution. Offer ed caregiving resources for students and employees . Negative Impacts: Asian and Asian American members of the UMB community impacted by national anti -Asian hate. Flexible scheduling and telework not possible for all exempt and non- exempt staff . Underrepresented students and first- generation college students unable to benef it from building support networks and connections due to engaging in primarily virtual learning. Increased stress and m ental health issues for students and employees. Stress of balancing home, caregiving, and work responsibilities. Schools will need to orient two new classes in fall 2021. Possibility of student loan debt increase . The majority of students have not been able to hold a federal work -study position due to regulations in place. 464UMB - Spring 2021 Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Report - Page 4 4. Required Appendix : Each institution should provide, as an appendix, a copy of the diversity plan in place during the 2020 -2021 Academic Year. Education Article \u00a711 -406 mandates that each public institution of higher education in the State develop and implement a plan that enhances cultural diversity programming a nd sensitivity to cultural diversity through instruction and training of the student body, faculty, and staff at the institution of higher education. The plan should include : i. Implementation strategy and a timeline for meeting goals within the plan; The 2 017- 2021 Strategic Plan (the \"Plan\") embeds the UMB diversity plan. UMB requires e ach school dean and vice president to align its unit plan with a comprehensive strategy addressing six priority themes. All units completed this alignment by the conclusion of FY17 . Theme 1 - Health, Justice, and Social Impact and Theme 4 - Inclusive Excellence directs efforts to impact DEI outcomes in UMB's internal and external environment. Twice yearly, each unit updates the status of the goals in its aligned plan . Approximately 25% of the 314 Plan goals address the preceding themes, with the majority of the strategies fully implemented, nearing completion, or showing significant progress as of December 31, 2020. The Plan's annual reports and summaries are avai lable for plan/progress- report/ . UMB embarking on the planning process for its 2022 -2026 Strategic Plan, which will be in place by July 1, 2021. Steering and Logistics committees formed that include representation from across UMB's seven schools and University- wide departments and off ices. These committees will aid in seeking input and developing plan themes and goals; drafting, finalizing, and adopting the plan; and designing a process for its implementation. New initiatives will advance anti -racism, DEI, and social justice efforts. P lan developers will pay considerable attention to setting key performance indicators and measuring and reporting on these activities' impact. UMB commenced a national search for a chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer and vice president (CDEIO /VP) in July 2020. The CDEIO will be an advisor, leader, and catalyst for institutional change focused on DEI at the institutional level, and will help UMB continue to advance DEI. Dr. Diane Forbes Berthoud will begin in this inaugural role on July 1, 2021 an d will play an instrumental role in advancing DEI strategic initiatives . ii. A description of the way the institution addresses cultural diversity among its student, faculty, and staff populations; The University of Maryland, Baltimore remains committed to elevating and addressing issues impacting the well -being of faculty, staff, and student s and the campus climate for diversity. Evidence of UMB's commitment includes the recent recruitment and hiring of its inaugural Chief Diversity , Equity, an d Inclusion Officer /Vice President , a cabinet -level position reporting to President Bruce Jarrell. Dr. Forbes Berthoud joins UMB on July 1, 2021. Among Dr. Forbes Berthoud's charge is to deepen and strengthen UMB's commitment to DEI and anti -racism. She will design and operationalize a transparent accountability framework that measures and evaluates the impact of DEI initiatives. Students A variety of initiatives within UMB's seven Schools and across the university advance cultural d iversity among students . In addition to ongoing strategic initiatives, the university has been responsive, through messaging and actions, to critical societal issues impacting our student and campus community, including violence against the Black community and anti -Asian hate. Over the past year, significant initiatives that positively influenc ed the campus climate for diversity for students included the establishment of the following : inaugural Intercultural Center and Executive Director of the Intercultural Leadership and Engagement Center ; inaugural Assistant Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Office for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the School of Social Work ; and an inaugural Committee on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and Chief Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Officer in the Graduate School . The University Student Government Association established an equity committee and a div ersity, equity, and inclusion officer position. 465UMB - Spring 2021 Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Report - Page 5 UMB continues to assess the student campus climate for diversity every two years. The Edu cation Advisory Board Campus Climate Survey was administered to students in spring 2018 and 2020. The survey results inform our understanding of students' experiences, perceptions, and behaviors with diversity and inclusion at UMB. These data inform the development of action items within UMB Student Affairs, the Schools, and across the university. Student Affairs used the survey results to inform the development of support websites for diverse student populations (e.g., Transgender and Non -Binary Resources , Student Veterans , Student Parents and Caregivers , Off-Campus Housing Information during COVID -19, DACA and Undocumented Student Resources , online students ). Campus climate results will also inform diversity strategic planning using an anti -racism lens within UMB Student Affairs . During the pandemic, enhanced resources and programming focused on students who are caregivers . Student Affairs and Human Resources Services collaborated to c ontract with CompPsych to provide resources to students who are caregivers. Additionally , accessibility in digital communication and transcriptions enhanced during the pandemic . A Student Pantry will launch in fall 2021 to assist students experiencing food insecurity. A name administration form was implemented allowing students, faculty, and staff to indicate their preferred/primary name. The University provided best practices for faculty and staff displaying pronouns in email signature lines. Faculty/Staff Human Resource Services (HRS) works closely with the D iversity Advisory Council (DAC) and each of the s chools and vice president - led units to further make UMB a more diverse and inclusive environment. HRS established goals that include staffing and development action items created in collaboration with the DAC. HRS looks forward to collaborating with Dr. Forbes Be rthoud to improve UMB's DEI employment and employee -related outcomes. HRS fosters a diverse and inclusive environment at the University. HRS operations span the University. Through our people -related processes, we collaborate to impact the experiences of both staff and faculty. We will continue to share data and best practi ces across the University and provide expert input in critical areas, including staff and faculty training, organizational develo pment, employee relations, and recruitment. UMB has increased its efforts to recruit administrators with the expertise and lens to i mprove diversity outcomes throughout the institution. HRS demonstrates our commitment to DEI by seeking the most qualified candidates to fill positions regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or other under -represented designations. Consequently, senior leaders are diversifying their recruitment efforts to hire qualified individuals from underrepresented groups. Universi ty leadership, HRS, Institutional Effectiveness, Strategic Planning and Assessment, and the DAC's Anti -Racism Action Committee are examining trends, evaluating survey results, and other metrics to inform our diversity efforts and positively impact our dive rsity and inclusion goals. HRS continues its collaborative efforts with the DAC during the recent development of programs to combat Anti -Asian Hate and other emerging areas of concern during the COVID -19 pandemic. iii. A description of how the institution plans to enhance cultural diversity (if improvement is needed); Cultural diversity enhancement will continue to be addressed in UMB's 2022 -2026 Strategic Plan and will remain a foundational pillar of our core values. UMB has elevated DEI with the newly -appointed cabinet- level position, a CDEIO/VP reporting directly to the president. The DAC will continue its advisory role. Many UMB employees are members of underrepresented groups. Reducing barriers to employment and en couraging career mobility remain top priorities for HRS. The institution needs to improve and publicize its career development activities, particularly to employees with limited career paths or significant wage improvement chances . In June 2020, UMB established an Intercultural Center and hired an inaugural Executive Director to advance DEI and anti - racism priorities across the university. The Center is playing an integral role in providing support for students from marginalized and underrepresented communities and co -curricular experi ences, workshops, and trainings that positively influence the cultural knowledge, skills, and attitudes of students and the UMB community. DEI and anti -racism efforts have been elevated and advanced in the Schools and across the university due to many initiatives, which includes the appointment of inaugural diversity officer positions in many schools and the creation of new initiatives (e.g., committees, programming). 466UMB - Spring 2021 Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Report - Page 6 iv. A process for reporting campus -based hate crimes; The University of Maryland, Baltimore Police Department (UMBPD) adheres to interdepartmental policy and procedures outlined in Written Directive 807 entitled, \" Jeanne Clery Campus Security Act\". This policy states: It shall be the Department's policy to comply with federal laws impacting the daily administration and operation of the UMBPD and to comply with obligations and requirements of the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act). We publish and distribu te an annual Clery Report to the U.S. Department of Education. The report identifies campus -based hate crimes as consistent with federal and institutional requirements. The report is published and distributed no later than October 1 of each year by the agency's Technical Services, and R ecords Lieutenant or designee, consistent with the Clery Act mandates. An annual notice of the availability of the annual Clery Report generated and made available to all current students and employees by the Technical Service and Records Lieutenant or des ignee no later than 10 days from the date of publication of the report by the U.S. Department of Education. As a public safety organization, UMBPD provides policy disclosure s, collect, classify and count crime reports, crime statistics and issue emergency notifications, and timely warnings in addition to retaining certain records for the dissemination of information. The submission of all statistical data initiated annually by August 1 using an electronic online submission to the U.S. Departmen t of Education. The submission of all Clery Act reportable statistical data, including hate crimes, completed annually to comply with the 2008 Amendments to the Clery Act, which mandates that hate crimes are reported in the published annual Clery Report. In support of the mandated requirements for compliance by the UMBPD, the Clery Act; Title 20, USC, SS 1092 (f), the records section requests required reporting from the Baltimore Police Department's Central and Western Districts, which surround the Universi ty. The UMBPD makes crime logs available to all students, employees, prospective students, prospective employees, and members of the community. UMBPD also works with the Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator works closely with the Department's Clery and Victim Assistance Coordinators as needed. The Title IX Coordinator also manages policies and procedures that permit administrative r eview and response apart from law enforcement when there is a hate crime, including sexual violence. Where the alleged perpetrator is a member of the UMB community, the Title IX Office can establish a review process that includes assuring accountability for actions substantiated as having occurred. When the impacted party is a member of the UMB community, the Title IX Coordinator can provide support and assistance to assure ongoing access to work, school, and other services. 467UMB - Spring 2021 Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Report - Page 7 v. A summary of any resources, including State grants, needed by the institution to effectively recruit and retain a culturally diverse st udent body. UMB professional schools can recruit and retain some of the best underrepresented minorities, but often, students are selecti ng other institutions where they receive a scholarship offer that covers tuition. Our awards across the schools range from $2,000 to $35,000. Additional funding would allow us to increase awards to make a meaningful impact in the funding provided to this cohort of students whose presence in the classroom offers richness to human services and health care educational experience s. Minority students represented 3,192 (45%) of the 7,087 enrollment total during s pring 2021. UMB awarded $3,630,902 in state funds to 422 students to recruit and retain diverse students in the School of Medicine, School of Dentistry, Carey School of Law, School of Pharmacy, the School of Social Work, the School of Nursing, BSN, the School of Medicine, Doctor of Physical Therapy, and the Department of Medical and Research Technology. Forty -one percent of minority students enrolled in spring 2020 received diversity state funding. Minority diversity differs based on the school/program. 2020 - 2021 Academic Year Diversity Awards Unit Dollar Amount Number of Students School of Medicine - MD $2,325,000 86 School of Dentistry - DDS $472,000 86 School of Dentistry - BSDH $0.00 0 Carey School of Law - JD $367,000 26 School of Pharmacy - Pharm D $136,590 44 School of Social Work - MSW $179,045 77 Physical Therapy - DPT $18,283 10 School of Nursing - BSN $83,001 83 Department of Medical & Research Technology - BS-DMRT $24,940 10 Total Awarded $3,630,903 422 MARYLAND , BALTIMORE COUNTY 469Spring 2021 Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Report Institution : University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) Date Submitted : April 12, 2021 Point of Contact : Dr. Antonio Moreira, Vice Provost for Academic Affairs, moreira@umbc.edu Ever Hanna, Office of Equity and Inclusion, Training and Case Manager, everhan n@umbc.edu Section 1 At UMBC, diversity is defined in its fullest scope, embracing not only racial and ethnic groups and individuals who are or have been underrepresented in higher education, but also including religious affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, ability, nationality, non- traditional student status, as well as other important characteristics. The UMBC Strategic Plan included in its preface, \"[w]ith this plan, our UMBC community focuses on strategic steps toward the next level of inclusive excellence. The plan honors our founding commitment to serve the citizens of Maryland and welcome people of all backgrounds into the life of the university. It bui lds on our achievements as a selective, public research university strongly connected with the economic and civic life of the Baltimore region and the State of Maryland.\" In addition, UMBC's new vision statement which was adopted in 2016 states: \"Our UMBC community redefines excellence in higher education through an inclusive culture that connects innovative teaching and learning, research across disciplines, and civic engagement. We will advance knowledge, economic prosperity, and social justice by welcoming and inspiring inquisitive minds from all backgrounds.\" When developing UMBC's 2019 diversity plan, UMBC integrated the broad diversity and inclusion goals from its prior 2009 plan with the specific, diversity and inclusion- related goals originating from UMBC's 2016 strategic plan. This planning process was inclusive of all campus stakeholders and identifies inclusion and diversity as both goals and recommendations in each of the four focus areas: the student experience, curriculum and pedagogy, extended connections and community and engagement and collective impact in research, scholarship and creative activities. Founded on the strategic plan, UMBC's strategic planning implementation plan was developed by UMBC's President an d the Council of Vice Presidents and Deans, and published in 2018. UMBC's Diversity Plan contains an annual update portion that integrates the specific, diversity- related strategies and initiatives derived from this implementation plan (identified for 2018- 2020 and continuing from 2016-17 and 2017-18). It is important to note that UMBC frequently implements its plans for inclusion and diversity through programs and initiatives that form part of the normal course of daily operations of the University, with out specifically designating them as diversity programs. In this way, UMBC has integrated many of its diversity related programs into the fabric of how it supports all students, faculty, staff, and through community engagement. Many of these components are nevertheless an important part of UMBC's ongoing plan for supporting and enhancing cultural and racial diversity at UMBC. 470 Section 2 Some of the most successful institutional initiatives designed to address diversity include: Inclusion Council (UMBC's Office of Equity and Inclusion): An advisory body of 25 faculty, staff and students that represent diverse populations across our community. This body ha s divided into 10 subgroups. These subgroups include over 100 additional community members and have been working throughout the 2020-21 school year to provide recommendations in a variety of equity and inclusion issue areas to university leadership. Interfolio and Diverse Faculty Recruitment : UMBC requires each search committee to create a diversity hiring recruitment plan, which includes an active recruitment strategy, draft job advertisement, and preliminary evaluation criteria. Plans are reviewed and approved by the respective Dean and the Provost Office. Each Dean is also charged with using Interfolio: Faculty Search to monitor the diversity of the applicant pools and make adjustments to the search if necessary. The STRIDE Committee provides peer education to support colleagues in conducting searches that reflect UMBC's core values of diversity and inclusion. Gender Identity Workgroup: This group, formed in Spring 2018, has been working to implement changes to make our community more inclusive of people with diverse gender identities. In Summer 2020, the group launched a self-service tool for students to provide their gender identities and pronouns across university platforms. Moving forward, this information will be collected via the Common App for all incoming students. Office of Academi c Opportunity Programs (AOP) : Provides resources and support to students who are traditionally underrepresented such as: Educational Talent Search (provides exposure to postsecondary education options to low-income, first-gen middle and high school students in Baltimore County), Upward Bound (promotes enhancement of student skills in Baltimore City and County schools through academic and cultural enrichment including emphasis on STEM). AOP also houses the McNair's Scholars Program , the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation , the First Generation Network , U-RISE (increases representation in Ph.D programs and research careers in the biomedical sciences), and the Meyerhoff Scholars Program (nationally recognized for its success in increasing represen tation in science and engineering). Student retention and academic success: the Division of Undergraduate Academic Affairs offers the Returning Women Student Scholars program aiming to increase academic success. Additionally, UMBC offers the Discovery Scholars Living-Learning Community, First -Year Seminar , Introduction to an Honors University, New Student Book Experience, Summer Bridge Program , and Transfer Seminars . The Academic Success Center provides centralized support services to all undergraduate students at UMBC. Enrollment Management hosts reception events for academically talented African American and Latinx high schoolers, financial aid outreach 471with B uilding Steps (encourages first gen and minority students in Baltimore City to attend college, focus on STEM), Golden Ticket Pre-Orientation Advising (provides first gen students and families the opportunity to learn more about academic requirements and planning tools), and partners with Raise.me to offer micro -scholarships to promote higher education to low-income, first gen students. Section 3 Some of the ways UMBC anticipates COVID -19 will most affect efforts to enhance diversity on campus include: Diversity in Graduate and Undergraduate Enrollment: For both graduate and undergraduate recruitment and enrollment initiatives, the COVID -19 pandemic continues to have a serious financial impact on students and their families. Students and families are rethinking their academic plans, considering options and even delaying their education. This changing financial landscape will require not only additional financial resources to support both the recruitment and retention of students but also flexibility in our approach to the delivery of instruction and academic and support services as students and families balance their responsibilities. UMBC's move to mostly remote instruction in March 2020 and continuing through the spring 2021 semester has had a disproport ionate impact on students from low- income and other families with poor access to the internet and appropriate computing resources although we have developed comprehensive supports to mitigate such impacts. We continue to actively monitor, both individually and collectively the success of our students and provide a variety of intervention and support mechanisms such as those developed by our new Academic Success Center and Student Advocates. One positive impact of the move to remote instruction is our ability to serve over 120 returning students to complete their degrees through our Finish Line Program. Diversity in Faculty Hiring: During this pandemic and continuing movements for social justice and equality, UMBC is committed to the recruitment, retention, and advancement of underrepresented minority faculty, who are disproportionately affected by these crises. Due to COVID-19 and the resulting significant reduction of our State appropriation, our ability to hire new faculty and faculty replacements has been severely constrained. Notwithstanding these challenges, faculty diversity and inclusive excellence remains a guiding principle of our institution in any faculty hiring during FY21. We have prioritized faculty hiring through our Postdoctoral Fellowship for Faculty Diversity, we have successfully converted all three fellows from Cohort V to assistant professor positions at UMBC, and will welcome two new fellows, one of whom is the inaugural fellow for faculty diversity in the Arts, in Cohort VI in July 2021. Diversity in Student Affairs and Services: The Division of Student Affairs has been careful to take into consideration the various ways students are being impacted by COVID-19, ongoing racial unrest in our country, and the dramatic changes in employment and income across the 472nation. A long with health, sense of belonging, and safety, exploring access, equity, and inclusion remain at the forefront of our decision making. Office of Equity and Inclusion: The Office of Equity and Inclusion (OEI) continues to receive reports through the online reporting form. Office staff have pivoted to offering intake, providing ongoing support and conducting investigations remotely. The transition to remote work provides additional equity and inclusion challenges for students, faculty and staff, and OEI continues to engage in new and innovative methods for hearing, responding to and resolving equity and inclusion issues for our community. Section 4 Appendix: Diversity Plan 2019 Diversity Plan- UMBC INTRODUCTION The University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) has established a commitment to diversity as one of its core principles for the recruitment and retention of faculty, staff and students and for the quality of the academic and campus community. Founded in 1966, UMBC is a selective, historically -diverse, public research university with a total student enrollment of 13,767 for Fall 2018. Diversity is defined at UMBC in its fullest scope, embracing not only racial and ethnic groups and individuals who are or have been underrepresented in higher education, but also including religious affiliation, sexual orientation and gender identity, disability, foreign nationality, non-traditional student status, and other important characteristics. UMBC's first Diversi ty Plan was written in 2009, in response to a state mandate. The original plan articulated four overarching diversity goals for UMBC. Over the intervening years, UMBC's wealth of diversity initiatives has deepened and grown, while the four overarching institutional goals have remained constant. The 2019 Diversity Plan for UMBC retains the four overarching UMBC diversity goals and integrates them with the two guiding diversity goals from USM, as required in the Diversity Report UMBC is mandated to submit annually. In development of the 2019 plan, UMBC has integrated the broad diversity scaffolding with the specific, diversity -related goals from UMBC's recent strategic plan to form part one as the core of the plan. It is anticipated that part one of the 2019 Diversity Plan will warrant review for possible updating in 2024. Part two of the 2019 Diversity Plan is the annual update portion. This portion of the plan integrates the specific, diversity -related strategies (identified for 2018-2020 and continuing from 2016-17 and 2017-18) from UMBC's 2018 strategic planning implementation document. It is anticipated that part two of the Diversity Plan will be updated annually --as needed and based on 473continue d implementation of UMBC's strategic plan--at the time UMBC d evelops its annual Diversity Report. Finally, it is important to note that UMBC frequently implements its plans for diversity through programs executed in the normal course of daily operations of the U niversity, without designating them as diversity programs. For example, a large proportion of UMBC's transfer students are persons of color. Because UMBC is strongly committed to ensuring the success of its transfer students, UMBC actively supports the racial and cultural diversity in its student population through programs that support transfer students. Because UMBC has thus woven many of its diversity programs into the fabric of how it supports all students, faculty, and the campus community, some of the initiatives included in part two of this plan may n ot include descriptors such as \"diversity\" but are nevertheless an important part of UMBC's ongoing plan for supporting and enhancing cultural and racial diversity at UMBC. Overarching Diversity Goals of USM and UMBC USM Goal 1: Increase the numerical representation of traditionally underrepresented groups among students, staff, and faculty. UMBC Goals: To ensure access to educational and employment opportunities for a diverse, student, faculty, and staff community To encourage and support individual development and advancement To provide conditions for personal success USM Goal 2: Create positive interactions and cultural awareness among students, faculty, and staff on campus. UMBC Goal: To provide a culture of safety, inclusion and respect PART I Core Diversity Plan, 2019-24 Excerpts from Our UMBC, A Strategic Plan for Advancing Excellence that support and advance USM's and UMBC's overarching diversity goals 474Strat egic Plan Preface With this plan, our UMBC community focuses on strategic steps toward the next level of inclusive excellence.

A description of how the institution defines diversity (no more than one page); how did the institution develop that definition (e.g., processes, sources, and guidance used)? In the spring of 2020, the Vice President for Diversity and Inclusion convened a d epartmental working group comprised of members of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) and the Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM) to develop definitions that would provide guidance for the unit s and, by extension, for the Universit y of Maryland. Due to the revision of the units ' website s, which includes shifting to an accessible platform, those definitions have not yet been publicized, b ut I share the definition of \"diversity\" in anticipation. Diversity : The full spectrum of human identities, backgrounds, experiences, and their intersections. (Our work for diversity advocates a strategic balance of these factors as understood through the lens of institutional and societal power. ) Diversity is further defi ned through university policies that are based on state and federal laws and guided by system policies. Our policies ensure that university programs, activities, and facilities are available to all, and that prohibit discrimination or harassment based on r ace, color, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, marital status, age, national origin, political affiliation, physical or mental disability, religion, protected veteran status, genetic information, personal appearance, or any other legal ly protected class (VI -1.00(B)). The preceding diverse identities are also protected from discrimination with regard to employment practices, \"including recruitment, advertising, job application procedures, hiring, upgrading, training, promotion, transfer, compensation, job assignments, benefits, and/or other terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, provided the individual is qualified, with or without reasonable accommodations, to perform the essential functions of the job. This policy applies to all jobs at the University of Maryland (VI-1.00(A)) .\" 2. A brief (no more than one page) highlight of the most successful ongoing and new institutional initiatives designed to address issues related to cultural diversity within the campus and the broader community, and how their efficacy is measure d. Faculty Advancement at Maryland for Inclusive Learning and Excellence (FAMILE): Announced by the Interim Provost on March 9, 2021, FAMILE is a diversity initiative aimed at increasing the number of underrepresented tenured or tenure -track faculty at the university. The goal is to increase faculty diversity and add over 100 new tenured or tenure -track faculty in departments and units across campus based on demonstrated diversity objectives. This progr am has three components , including: 1) President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program; 2) Assistant Professor Targeted Hire Program; and 3) Senior Targeted Hire Program. A primary focus is the creation of a welcoming and embracing climate in which each recru it is incorporated into a collegial academic community and is exposed to a set of connections that will advance the person's expertise, career, and sense of agency. Thus, each unit/college in its request for funding for the specific programs will have to s ubmit a Faculty Retention Plan . The total commitment by the University with matching funds from the Deans is estimated at more than $40M over the next 10 years. Efficacy will be measured through institutional employment data and comparison to institutional peers. 486TerrapinSTRONG: Announced by President Pines when he assumed the presidency on July 1, 2020, TerrapinSTRONG is an affirmative set of shared values, actions, identity and agency that connects all University of Maryland community members. The vision of the program is to create an inclusive environment where every member of our community feels that they belong and are empowered to reach their full potential. To be TerrapinSTRONG is to: 1) Engage diversity to impact grand challenges of our times. We in vest in knowledge, skills and practices that enable us to work collaboratively in advancing our diverse, globally connected society ; 2) Acknowledge the role the University of Maryland has played throughout its history in denying access and full participati on. We rest on indigenous land that was stolen from the Piscataway People by European colonists, and plantation land granted to us by slaveholders. We recognize patterns of disenfranchisement and discrimination that have restricted participation based on i ndividuals' race, sex, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, socio - economic background, physical or mental disability, national origin, and religion ; 3) Celebrate University of Maryland traditions, trailblazers, and communities. We show Terrap in Pride ; 4) Take actions to advance diversity, equity, inclusion and social justice. We advocate for human rights within our personal lives, our fields or areas of study, and the university community. This new initiative remains in development, focusing o n an onboarding segment for incoming students and new employees. Elements of the program were initiated by academic colleges in spring 2021 and feedback from student evaluations indicate that students believe their participation increased their sense of be longing, which is particularly important during the pandemic and resulting online instruction and interaction. Efficacy will be measured by continuing surveys and other measures, including retention and community feedback. Diversity Education Task Force: Convened in 2018, DETF has issued recommendations to improve campus diversity and inclusion climate. These include modifying the existing diversity requirement category labels and learning outcomes, adding explicit diversity content to gateway courses, of fering diversity and civic engagement credentials and highlighting the value of micro -credentials to employers, and requiring all majors to include discipline -relevant diversity education. Each of these recommendations, in addition to others, will require different metrics for evaluation, and a primary consideration is that fulfilling these recommendations should not add more required credit hours to degrees. The 1856 Project: UMD has joined the national organization of Universities Studying Slavery, house d at the University of Virginia, and our chapter is titled The 1856 Project to coincide with the founding year of our institution. While still in formation, 1856 is poised to become an important contributor to the full understanding of the ways in which sl avery, segregation, and activism has impacted UMD since its very beginnings. A diversity of initiatives such as a digital historical database of the campus and community as well as courses in history and archeology have been proposed. Efficacy will be dete rmined through the appropriate metrics for each programming category. Bowie State University -University of Maryland Social Justice Alliance: Launched in October 2020 in partnership with the Lt. Richard Collins III Foundation, the BSU -UMD SJA honors the l egacy of BSU alumnus Lt. Collins and promotes social justice on both campuses through shared programs, courses, and other forms of cultural and intellectual partnership. The alliance address es critical issues facing campuses, communities and the nation by engaging our students and communities to bring about the social justice change we want to see. The alliance will host public programming, including symposiums and a national conference, to stimulate conversations and direct action for change. The alliance will provide learning opportunities for BSU and UMD students by infusing social justice education in the curriculum and experiential activitie s. Efficacy will be determined by appropriate measures, including evaluations, surveys, and participation counts. 487Record -breaking Applications: UMD has received a record -breaking achievement of 50,000 applications for admission, which includes record -high applications from Black and Latinx students. This milestone was achieved through the strategic approaches we have taken across campus to create an inclusive environment as well as increased outreach to BIPOC students. The following are some of the contributing factors to our success: Maryland Ascent Program helps high school students who are first -generation from Bal timore City and Prince Georges county navigate the college admission process, providing one -on-one counselling from start to finish ; SAT and ACT scores optional , which has been extended through 2023; Incentive Awards Program provides full academic scholarships and other wraparound support services to students from underserved communities in Prince George's County, Baltimore City, and Montgomery County. In addition, o ur Black students graduate at a much higher rate than many of our peer institutions. UMD is ranked among the top of our Big Ten peers in our 6 -year graduation rate for Black and African American students; our 6 -year graduation rate for Black and African American students is 81.3%, compared to a mean rate of 71.3% among our Big Ten peers. We are also ranked No. 1 among AAU universities for the number of bachelor's degrees conferred to African -American students. For Latinx students, our graduate rate is 81.5% compared to 76.6% for our peers. While we still have much more to accomplish, our data demonstrates that our strategies have had impact. 3. A brief (no more than one page) discussion of the ways in which the institution anticipates COVID -19 most affecting - either negatively or positively - efforts to enhance dive rsity on campus. This may include, for example, acknowledgement of issues such as disproportionate impacts on retention and graduation among certain populations; the shift to distance education modalities limiting the ability to provide in -person programmi ng; or, in contrast, the shift to online education providing opportunity for more students to access diversity programming. It is common knowledge that the loneliness and isolation enforced by the pandemic has been psychologically destructive to all membe rs of our campus community due to the lost physical connection and continuity of campus life. We have experienced two suicides this year, both of trans students who were vital and popular members of our community; their loss has reverberated across campus. Our faculty have been sensitive to these issues as well as others such as the lack of digital access experienced by some students, and we have emphasized the need to consider limitations that students may face due to technology, upheaval and loss in their personal lives, and overall mental health. It has been hard for students to remain invested, with Zoom awkwardness and fatigue taking its toll both in courses and in some diversity programming. That said, much of our program ming has generated new audience s and we have seen attendance increase x10 for our anti -racism series. The focus on racism resulting from George Floyd's death , anti - Asian attacks, and the disproportionate impact of the covid pandemic on Black and Brown communities has led to examinations of the country's legacy of racism and enabled us to start and sustain difficult conversations . The massive increase in demand for training, consultation, and other forms of professional and personal development around issues of diversi ty gives me hope that this current inflection point will provide guidance for our futures. 488APPEN DIX 4. Required Appendix: Each institution should provide, as an appendix, a copy of the diversity plan in place during the 2020 -2021 Academic Year. Education Article \u00a711 -406 mandates that each public institution of higher education in the State develop and implement a plan that enhances cultural diversity programming and sensitivity to cultural diversity through instruction and training of the student body, faculty, and s taff at the institution of higher education. The plan should include: i. Implementation strategy and a timeline for meeting goals within the plan; ii. A description of the way the institution addresses cultural diversity among its student, faculty, and staff populations; iii. A description of how the institution plans to enhance cultural diversity (if improvement is needed); iv. A process for reporting campus -based hate crimes; and v. A summary of any resources, including State grants, needed by the institution to effecti vely recruit and retain a culturally diverse student body. 4.i. Attached to this report is a copy of UMD 's 2010 diversity plan as well the recommendations of the 2018 reco mmendations of the Joint President/Senate Inclusion and Respect Task Force. Those recommendations have gui ded the activities and ini tiatives within the Office of Diversity and Inclusion. While we continue working to establish a more centralized delivery of DEI services , the recommendations of the Task Force have been predominantly met. The univer sity is pre pared to embar k on implementing a new str ategic p lan, and a new diversity plan will be developed s hortly thereafter. The alig nment between the two plans will be critica l, and the importan ce of having a standalon e diversity plan with timelines will enhance accountability. 4.ii. We address our cultur al diversity by em bracing it. During the past year, the V ice President for Diver sity and Inclu sion and the Vice Pres ident for Stu dent Aff airs, along with the P resident as m erited , have met with a gro up of approximately 30 Black student leaders to discuss student deman ds that have been brought f orward over the years. We have honed t hose demands to 25 action items that the university will pursue to address cu ltural diversity, and we have developed a website that promotes accountability and provides transparent information to the univer sity community: https://diversity.umd.edu/black -student -leaders/ . This partnership has been recognized nationally and was recently featured in an extended arti cle by our Dia mond meeting with Black graduat e stu dents as well as other consti tuency groups to better understand the i ssues groups encounter and how we can address them. We have held \"Community Conversations \" with small groups of stud ents, fa culty, and staff (separate groups for exempt and non -exempt) to discuss campus issues related to DEI . We will be con tinuing those con versati ons to gather more input on how we can address campus concerns. 4.iii. While this has been addressed in pre vious sections of this report, it is important to reiterate that our eff orts are as transparent as po ssible in order to ensure campus invo lvement. 4.iv. Hate crimes shou ld be reported to campus police and bias incidences report ed to Bias Inci dent Support Services (BISS). Our updated bias incident response protocol can be found here: https://diversity.umd.edu/bias/response/ , and a br ief overview document is attached . 4894.v. Additional fu nding for student fina ncial a id, inclu ding adequ ate increase s in Pell Grants , would be welcome. This in cludes s cholarships direct ed towards sta te and county re sidents. In additi on, ensur ing that s tudent support services are adequately funded through state budgeting w ould benefit retention efforts and contribute to closing the graduation gap. For ex ample, our Office of M ulti-ethnic Student Education (OMSE) , which provides academic and logistical support for predomina ntly Black and Latinx students, reli es heavily on fundraising rather than a base sta te budget. Providing additiona l state funding through the forms of grants focused specifically on supporting divers e students would cr eate a statewide recruitment campaig n that could then be supported by budgeted programming. 490A section name : section sub-head Expectations for Excellence in Diversity and Inclusion \u00bb Transforming Maryland 491B the university of maryland TABLE Maryland's strategic plan for diversity, Transforming Maryland: Expectations for Excellence in Diversity and Inclusion, was produced by University Marketing and Communications for the Diversity Steering Plan Committee. Special thanks go to the plan's editor, Joanna Schmeissner. 492The Strategic Plan for Diversity at the University of Maryland december 2010Endorsed by the University Senate on September 16, 2010Expectations for Excellence in Diversity and Inclusion \u00bbTransforming Maryland 4932 the university of maryland from the President The University of Maryland has long promoted diversity as a core value . We recognize a diverse educational community as one of our gr eatest strengths . I am proud to be continuing in the tradition of recent University of Maryland presidents who led us to outstanding accomplishments in this area, including Robert Gluckstern, John Slaughter, William Kirwan and C . D . Mote, Jr . Under their leadership, the university embraced a vigorous commitment to becoming a multiethnic, multiracial, and multicultural institution . The diversity plan presented here, Transforming M aryland: Expectations for Excellence in Diversity and Inclusion, is aligned with the university's strategic plan, which represents the aspirations of our community and calls for the University of Maryland to renew its efforts in diversity . The strategic plan articulates three principles for which we must strive as a preeminent r esearch university: impact, leadership, and excellence . The diversity of our faculty, staff, and students is a fundamental component of each of those principles . Our 10-year diversity plan is visionary, inspirational, and inclusive, and calls on our univ ersity to serve as a leader for the next generation of scholars . It clearly sets forth our aspiration and our determination to become a model diverse community of learning, exploration, and self-examination whose impact will be felt across the state of M aryland and the nation . I embrace the vision outlined in this document and ask that you read, review, and commit to implementing its strategies and goals . Wallace D . Loh President 4943 prefacefrom the Chair, Diversity Plan Steering Committee The strategic plan for diversity at the University of Maryland, Transforming Maryland: Expectations for Excellence in Diversity and Inclusion, is a document that represents the remarkable journey of the University of Maryland, College Park . The first 100 years in the history of the university reflect the challenges of our state and the nation . Many were excluded fr om obtaining an education and working here, and the curriculum made invisible the contributions of many in our society . However , the past 50 years at Maryland have been extraordinary, first as we integrated all populations into the student body, faculty, and staff, and then as we eagerly embraced the idea of diversity, transforming the institution into a national leader in this area . Today we are w ell on the path toward realizing our vision of being a \"model multiracial, multicultural, and multigenerational academic community .\" I am tremendously grateful to the members of the Diversity Plan Steering Committee for their har d work, diligence, and dedication to developing this plan over an 18-month period . I would also like to thank the hundreds of University of Mar yland community members who attended town hall meetings and listening sessions and submitted comments on the plan . The suggestions offered improved the document and expanded o wnership of the notion of diversity beyond any single community . I would also like to thank the University Senate and university leadership for endorsing and embracing the document . Those of us who worked together to develop the plan believe that Maryland is poised to become the univ ersity model for diversity and inclusive excellence in the nation . We have developed a 10-y ear document that lays a comprehensive roadmap for meeting this goal and calls on the University of Maryland to serve in a preeminent leadership role for the next generation of scholars . Robert Waters Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs and Assistant to the President Chair, Diversity Plan Steering Committee 4954 the university of maryland i. The University of Maryland's Commitment to Di versity \u00bb 4965 commitment to diversityThe University of Maryland, the flagship of the University System of Maryland and one of the nation's top research universities, has long embraced diversity as a core value and counts a diverse educational community among its great strengths . Our commitment to diversity rests on three tenets: 1 . We believe that living and working in a community that accepts and celebrates diversity is a joy and a privilege that contributes to the vitality and ex cellence of the educational experience . 2 . We believe that as a state university, we hav e a responsibility to assure all citizens access to the transformative experience of an outstanding higher education and the opportunity for success in this experience . 3 . We believe it is essential that our students have exposure to different perspectiv es, that they interact with people from different backgrounds, and that they explore ideas with those from different cultures in order to succeed in an increasingly diverse workplace and global community . 4976 the university of maryland In short, creating an educational and work environment that is rich in diversity, inclusive, and supportive of all students, faculty, and staff is morally right and educationally sound . We commit ourselves fully to implementing the strategies set forth in this plan to achiev e an optimal environment for all members of the university community . The university strategic plan of 2008, Transfor ming Maryland: Higher Expectations, clearly states the results we strive for as a preeminent university: impact, leadership, and excellence . We know without doubt that the diversity of our univ ersity faculty, staff, and students is a cornerstone of that excellence . This diversity plan is aligned with the goals of the university strategic plan . It calls for the university to energetically renew its effor ts in diversity . The results will be transformative . The strategic plan states the mission of the university with eloquence: \"As the flagship, its task is to look ov er the horizon, attract the most brilliant minds, advance the frontiers of knowledge, stimulate innovation and creativity, and educate those who will be leaders in business, public service, education, the arts, and many other fields .\" To succeed in this task we must have a community that acknowledges and celebrates div ersity in all its dimensions . Through the goals and strategies outlined in this plan, we intend to secure and maintain a working and learning envir onment in which all members of our community are welcomed and can flourish regardless of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, personal appearance, age, national origin, political affiliation, or hidden or visible disabilities . We are confident that we can meet the goals outlined in this document because the university has special str engths on which it can build: 1) a history of national leadership in diversity initiatives during the past three decades; 2) a substantial record of scholarship on diversity issues across the disciplines; 3) a location that offers opportunities to engage with a wealth of diverse communities, including large African American, Hispanic American/Latino/a, and Asian American populations, and thanks to the proximity of the federal government agencies and offices, a substantial international population; and 4) a conviction that a university community energized by diverse perspectives and experiences provides an enriching educational experience and strong competitive edge for our students, our faculty, and our state . We are uniquely positioned to influence the world outside the university based on the contributions and resear ch of our faculty, students, and staff . Our vision for the next decade is to become a model diverse community of learning, exploration, and self-examination whose impact is felt across the state and the region and thr oughout the nation and world . 4987 section name : section sub-head overview and background ii. The University's Transformation into a Leader in Di versity \u00bb 4998 the university of maryland University of Maryland Leaders Embrace Diversity The university undertakes this new diversity plan after three decades of successful initiatives that focus on diversity issues . We are confident in the university' s ability to meet new challenges in creating the community of the future . After an early history in which the university engaged in deplorable practices of discrimination and held destructive pr ejudices against women, we now have a keen appreciation of the moral imperative of equity and diversity . We know that at the time of its founding in 1856, 16 of the first 24 trustees of the M aryland Agricultural College were slave owners and that slaves labored, if not on campus, certainly throughout Prince George's County, in which it was built . White women were first admitted in 1916, and African Americans in 1951 . Though slower than we would wish in including all citizens and cr eating an appropriate climate for their success, in the past decades the university eagerly adopted the ideal of diversity and has worked diligently to transform the campus to become a national leader in this area . The University of Maryland 's strategies were among those highlighted in the Diversity Blueprint: A Planning Manual for Colleges and Universities, published with the American Association for Colleges and Universities (aac&u) in 1995 . Today we are on the path towar d realizing our vision of being a \"model multiracial, multicultural, and multigenerational academic community .\" We have been guided by many dedicated members of the campus community in this transformation, especially three exceptional leaders: Dr . John Slaughter, chancellor, 1982-88; D r . William E . Kirwan, Jr ., president, 1998-2010 . Under their leadership, the university embraced a commitment to div ersity with unwavering vigor . The journey toward a diverse and inclusiv e institution began with race and gender, but the imperative to address other identities became apparent as we undertook various initiatives . Indeed our terminology that today favors the word \" diversity\" evolved from a growing understanding of the complexity of this work . During his tenure as chancellor of the University of Mar yland, Dr . Slaughter, one of the first African American chancellors of a major state university, challenged the campus to become a \" model multiracial, multicultural, and multigenerational academic community .\" Under Dr . Slaughter's leadership, the univ ersity moved from being an institution focused merely on compliance with equity mandates, to an academic community that addressed diversity pro actively . Under the leadership of his successor, President Kir wan, the university made giant strides in its commitment to equity and inclusion for minorities . His administration supported major initiatives designed to involv e every campus unit and department in activities that supported minority faculty, staff, and students . University leaders raised expectations for recruitment of faculty , undergraduates, and graduate students from under represented groups; developed major initiatives to support and mentor minority members on our campus; and provided significant financial support for activities likely to increase the success of minority members of the university community . From 1990 through 1995, Pr esident Kirwan led the university's defense of a legal challenge to the university's Banneker scholarship, a program designed to enroll academically talented African American students . While the court eventually ruled against the race-ex clusive nature of the scholarship, the university's defense of the case was a first step in developing the now-widespread use of the diversity rationale to advance affirmative action goals in higher education . President Mote built on these efforts, deepened our understanding of the complexities of div erse backgrounds and identities, and expanded the focus of our commitment . He sponsored innovativ e and successful programs that reached into Maryland communities with large numbers of disadvantaged students, and created pipelines for students who had overcome adverse circumstances to obtain an affordable college education . In the past decade, the university significantly increased the graduation rates of undergraduates from all racial/ethnic backgr ounds, and made substantial progress in closing the achievement gap . In recognition of the university' s growing global impact, President Mote also vigorously supported programs that offer students life-changing international experiences . Led by the former president, the administration pushed aggressively to pr omote the rights of gays, lesbians, and women and fought to obtain benefits for domestic partners of university employees . The state began providing same-sex domestic partner health benefits to Mar yland state employees and retirees in July 2009 . Under President Mote 's leadership, the university also introduced new family-friendly policies and programs to help faculty, staff, and students balance their academic, work, and family responsibilities . 5009 Diversity and inclusiveness have, over time, become integral and ongoing components of the university's institutional identity . A quantitative sketch of our successes indicates how far the University of M aryland has progressed in recent decades . The diversity of our students: Students of color comprise 34% of the undergraduate student body . African American students constitute 12% of our undergraduates . Asian American students comprise 15% of Maryland's undergraduates . The Hispanic American/Latino/a student population increased 29% at the undergraduate level and 58% at the graduate level from 2001 to 2009 . The percentage of new minority graduate students increased from 16% in 2001 to 21% in 2009. The success of our students: The University of Maryland is one of the top degree- granting institutions for African American and other minority students in the United States . In 2009, our campus was rated No . 1 among aau institutions for the number of African American Ph .D .s . In a 2010 study by the Education Trust, the university had the fourth-highest ranking for 2007 graduation rates of minorities among public research universities . In the same study, the university was ranked 14th in improved graduation rates for minority students (2002-07) . Six-year graduation rates for African American students have increased from 46.3% to 70.4% in the past 10 years (Classes of Fall 1993 and Fall 2003) . Graduation rates for Hispanic American/Latino/a students rose from 49.3% to 72.0% in the same time period . The university has achieved parity between male and female bachelor's and master's degree r ecipients since 2001 . In fact, between 2001 and 2008 more women than men wer e awarded Bachelor's degrees . The gap between male and female doctorates is also narrowing, with women earning 48% of all doctoral degrees in 2009 . The diversity of our f aculty and staff: Between 2000 and 2009, the percentage of women in the tenured/tenure track faculty increased from 26% to 31% and the percentage of faculty of color in this group increased from 16% to 20%. In 2009, one-third of new tenured/tenure track faculty hires were women and 43% were members of ethnic minority groups . The number of women department chairs grew from six in 2004 to 15 in 2009, a 150% increase. The university's diverse staff is 16% African American, 7% Asian American, 5% Hispanic American/Latino/a, 17% from other nations, and 52% women. a leader in diversityWhere We Are Tod Ay: diversi Ty Accomplishmen Ts 50110 the university of maryland aking Diversity I nitiatives at Maryland \u00bb 50211 diversity initiativesUniversity Offices that Promote Equity and Diversity Several campus programs have been established that address diversity issues, and the dates of their inception reflect the growing understanding of the complexity of diversity and the variety of groups that need to be served . The Office of Human R elations Programs (1971), now known as the Office of Diversity and Inclusion (odi), is responsible for compliance with the Human Relations Code that contains our official nondiscrimination policy (1976; amended in 1992 to include sexual orientation) . The office also provides a variety of multicultural and diversity education pr ograms, including intergroup dialogues . Many other offices, centers, and programs address specific issues . These include the: Nyumburu Cultural Center (1971) Office of Multi-Ethnic Student Education (1971) Disability Support Services (1977) Office of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (lgbt ) Equity (1998) Maryland Incentive Awards Program (2000) Office of Multicultural Involvement and Community Advocacy (2006), formerly Student Involv ement and Minority Programs (1987) Special presidential commissions focus on eliminating inequity and fostering community for specific groups on campus . The four President's Commissions focus on: W omen's Issues (1973), Ethnic Minority Issues (1973), Disability Issues (1986), and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and T ransgender Issues (1997) . The Provost' s Conversations on Diversity, Democracy, and Higher Education, established in 2003, promote university- wide awareness and dialogue about nationally important diversity issues . Diversity in the Curriculum The university has been a leader in inter disciplinary programs, with its American Studies program (1945) one of the earliest in the nation . This history was a stepping-stone for academic programs and concentrations that focus on educational issues surrounding specific areas of div ersity . First introduced in the 1960s, these programs have helped to br oaden our understanding of diversity, cultivate community, and build support for various social identity groups . Many programs that began as concentrations in traditional departments led to the establishment of formal academic programs: African American Studies (1968) Women's Studies (1977) Jewish Studies (1980) Latin American Studies (1989) Asian American Studies (2000) Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies (2002) Persian Studies (2004) u.s. Latino Studies (2007) The university has also been a national leader in fostering div ersity as a serious topic for research and academic exploration . One of the most important and successful initiatives has been the Consortium on Race, G ender, and Ethnicity (1998) . Faculty members working through the Consortium hav e published groundbreaking studies on the complexity of issues surrounding self-identity and diversity . In 2008, the u.s. D epartment of Education granted the university status as a minority-serving institution for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, a gateway to targeted support for the growth of academic programs and support for student scholarships . The David C . Driskell Center for the Study of the Visual Ar ts and Culture of African Americans and the African Diaspora, established at umd in 2001, preserves the heritage of African American visual arts and culture . Existing and new courses within established disciplines have been infused with elements and principles of diversity with the assistance of the Curriculum T ransformation Project (1989) . Since 1990, undergraduate students have had a core diversity requirement, and they currently have co-curricular opportunities that address diversity such as Words of Engagement: Intergroup Dialogue Program (2000) and the Common Ground Multicultural Dialogue Program (2000) . There are far more activities, campus-wide, and locally, than we can include in this o verview, but the programs listed above represent the breadth of our commitment to building a diverse and inclusive campus community . 50312 the university of maryland 50413 section name : section sub-head recommendationsThe University of Maryland has laid a strong and broad foundation for diversity and equity over the past three decades . The recommendations in the diversity strategic plan aim to ensure that the university will build on this foundation and continue as one of the nation 's higher education leaders in diversity, equity, and inclusion . Clearly, the university has made great progr ess . However , building a community in which support for diversity permeates all levels is an ongoing process . The university still has much to do to create the optimal and inclusive learning and work envir onment to which it aspires . Vigorous efforts should be made to fur ther diversify the senior leadership, faculty, and student body; to create a more vibrant and inclusive campus community; to support diversity-related research; and to implement a curriculum that prepares our students to succeed in a multicultural, globally interconnected world . This plan sets forth strategies to take us to the next level . Our plan seeks to accomplish three goals: 1 . To ensure policies and structures are in place at all lev els of the university to support transformational leadership, recruitment, and inclusion efforts, and to institutionalize campus diversity goals; 2 . To foster a positive climate that promotes student success and encourages faculty and staff members to flourish; and 3 . To promote a vision across the university that fully appreciates div ersity as a core value and educational benefit to be studied, cultivated, and embraced as a vital component of personal development and growth . The plan includes many exciting, bold initiatives to help the university meet its goal of excellence in diversity . Highlights include: the appointment of a chief diversity officer and creation of an Office of Univ ersity Diversity; the establishment of a representative Diversity Advisory Council that will give a central voice to the needs and visions of diverse groups at all levels of the campus community; the introduction of new initiatives to assist with recruitment and retention, such as cluster faculty hires and work-family initiatives; the creation of a \"building community\" fund to support innovative approaches for enhancing the campus climate; and the emphasis on challenging new general education diversity requirements that will engage students in learning about plural societies and prepare them to be culturally competent leaders . Following are the major goals and strategies of the diversity strategic plan, organiz ed in six core areas: Leadership, Climate, Recruitment and Retention, Education, Research and Scholarship, and Community Engagement . A. leAdership Leadership is essential to building a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable institution . This plan proposes to strengthen the diversity leadership throughout the campus . The goals and strategies listed below recognize that leadership in diversity must come fr om senior leaders as well as from the ranks of students, faculty, and staff . First, the plan calls for leadership from the top . When the university' s senior administrators endorse diversity programs and initiatives, they affirm that diversity is a core value and set the tone for action throughout the university . The appointment of a chief diversity officer and establishment of a campus-wide Div ersity Advisory Council to replace the current Equity Council will be a visible signal of this commitment . With wide representation fr om campus groups, the new council will focus on major diversity initiatives that can help move the campus forward . IV . Recommendations \u00bb \u00bb 50514 Second, leadership in diversity requires a commitment to increasing the presence of individuals from diverse populations among those in charge at all levels . This plan proposes an energetic effort to increase their numbers through r obust recruitment strategies . In addition, the university should expand and strengthen programs of pr ofessional development that prepare individuals from underrepresented groups already on campus to move into positions of leadership . Students, faculty, and staff all benefit from a community in which those in charge reflect div ersity among their ranks . Finally, the university should support a vigor ous effort to inculcate the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all faculty, staff, and students so that leadership in diversity is something every member of the university community understands and for which each one feels responsible . GOAL A.1 The univer sity will provide strong leadership for diversity and inclusion at all campus levels. Strategies A . The president will appoint a chief diversity officer (preferably a vice president with faculty rank) who repor ts directly to the president and is a member of the President's Cabinet . B . The university will create an Office of University Div ersity led by the chief diversity officer . The officer and his or her staff will advocate for diversity and equity issues; provide activ e oversight, coordination, and evaluation of work in these areas; track university progress in meeting the goals of the diversity strategic plan; and encourage and support the efforts of units to achieve their diversity goals . 50615 recommendations The office will serve as a resource providing regular and accurate information on existing university equity and diversity programs, centers, academic units, and identity- based organizations . The office will develop a comprehensive communication plan and strong campus Web presence to: pro vide diversity and equity information; disseminate examples of best practices for promoting diversity and inclusion; and highlight the university's leadership in diversity research, academic, and co-curricular programming, minority graduation rates, and other accomplishments . The office will establish a resource center to share diversity materials (e .g ., curricula/syllabi, co-curricular programs, fellowships, funding opportunities) and pro vide a site for consultation and collaboration on diversity, equity, and climate issues . C . The university will create a campus-wide diversity advisory council with repr esentatives from all divisions, schools/ colleges, graduate and undergraduate student bodies, and other appropriate units, to play a key role in advising the chief diversity officer regarding diversity decision-making, planning, and training . Units represented on the diversity advisory council will appoint diversity officers who will be responsible for providing diversity education and training, o verseeing climate assessments, and supporting diversity-related recruitment/retention, programming, and evaluation efforts within the unit . Diversity officers will also collaborate on campus-wide diversity initiatives . Responsibilities, expectations, and accountability for diversity officers will be clearly defined and consistent across units . Although the diversity advisory council will replace the Equity Council as the major diversity leadership body, units may continue to appoint equity administrators to oversee all aspects of sear ch and selection procedures, including data collection . D . The president, vice presidents, and deans will take steps to increase the diversity of leadership ranks across all divisions, colleges/schools, and depar tments/units to support a diverse and inclusive institution . E . The university leadership will help each unit establish measurable goals for diversity and inclusion at the division, college or school, and department/unit lev els and help units meet their goals . Accountability mechanisms will be used to assess outcomes . Support for diversity and inclusion will be a uniform qualification for all leadership positions and a performance criterion in the annual reviews of all campus leaders . GOAL A.2: The university will incr ease opportunities for leadership training, mentoring, professional growth, and advancement of diverse faculty and staff in all divisions. Strategies A . The Provost' s Office will: Provide an annual leadership orientation for all new vice presidents, deans, and department chairs that includes a significant focus on fostering diversity and inclusion . This orientation should address such topics as supporting diversity resear ch/scholarship and teaching, creating an inclusive climate, dealing with sexual harassment, and recruiting and retaining diverse faculty, staff, and students . Offer leadership training and mentoring programs, such as 50716 the university of maryland the university's Leadership Education and Administrative Development (lead) program, which prepare tenured faculty to assume campus and professional leadership positions . Women, minorities, and faculty from diverse backgr ounds will be actively encouraged to apply for these programs . B . The university will establish leadership education and mentoring programs for talented staff from diverse groups that pr ovide avenues for professional growth, network development, and career advancement . C . The chief diversity officer will offer periodic training that prepares faculty and staff from all groups to be influential leaders, adv ocates, and spokespeople for diversity initiatives across the campus . B. climATe All individuals in a community need to feel that their individual worth is recognized, their work is respected, and they work in an environment in which they can flourish . If students feel marginalized because they are different fr om those in the mainstream, if faculty or staff members feel that their contributions are not valued, or if any individual feels isolated and excluded by a climate that is unfriendly or uninterested, the university community is diminished . A welcoming, supportive climate is essential in our academic community . The university has in place clearly defined policies and legal guidelines to deal with egregious problems such as sexual harassment, hate speech, or threats . The initiatives addressed in this plan aim to ensure that we go bey ond a neutral climate to one that is completely supportive and inclusive . This diversity plan focuses on ways to enhance day-to-day learning and working conditions . The creation of a climate that nurtures and supports all of its members r equires proactive acts of self-examination . Many useful tools are available for self-assessment of the workplace and classr oom climate . Exit surveys, for example, are accepted and v aluable ways to measure experiences . The plan proposes surveys and other formal assessments as initial steps, but units will also find it helpful to gauge climate issues through informal gr oup discussions, spontaneous interviews with individuals in the unit, and other activities . GOAL B.1: The univer sity will ensure a welcoming and inclusive learning community, workplace, and campus environment. Strategies A . Units will actively support and demonstrate adherence to the univ ersity's policies on equity, non-discrimination, compliance, and equal employment opportunity/affirmative action . 50817 recommendationsB . The chief diversity officer, in collaboration with the Diversity Advisor y Council, will: Create an online climate assessment survey that will be administered by all units to establish a baseline so they can assess their needs in creating a climate conducive to success . The results will be submitted to appropriate unit heads (e .g ., deans, vice presidents) for review and feedback . The climate assessment survey will be repeated periodically, maybe ev en annually, as dictated by the results . Create the framework for a climate enhancement plan and help units use the plan to identify strategies for responding to climate concerns and to create an inclusive, welcoming environment . Climate enhancement plans will be submitted to and discussed with appropriate unit heads and unit diversity officers . Develop a schedule for unit heads and the Diversity Advisory Council to reach out, work with units, and offer them support and advice as indicated b y the results of their climate assessment surveys and the outcomes of their climate enhancement plan activities . C . The university will survey graduating students on an annual basis concerning the impact of their diversity-related educational and co-curricular experiences, as w ell as their perceptions of the campus climate . GOAL B.2: The universit y will develop and implement innovative, cross-cutting programs to improve and enhance the campus climate for diverse students, faculty, staff, and visitors. Strategies A . The chief diversity officer, in consultation with the Diversity Advisor y Council, will identify common themes that arise from climate assessments and develop campus-wide programs to foster an inclusive, civil environment and to remedy climate-related problems . B . The university will create a \"building community\" fund administered by the chief div ersity officer to support innovative initiatives for enhancing the climate within and/or across units, and between social identity groups on campus . C . Across the university, in campus-wide social activities and campus offices designed to address issues of differ ent cultural and identity groups, the university will celebrate and promote a community based on inclusiveness and respect for 50918 the university of maryland differences, encouraging close interaction among individuals on campus with varying backgrounds, experiences, interests, and perspectives . D . The President's Office will continue to support the Commissions on Women's Issues, Ethnic and Minority Issues; Disability Issues; and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and T ransgender Issues in their work to identify campus diversity concerns, educate university constituencies, advocate for programmatic and policy improvements, and celebrate the achievements of diverse members of the campus community . With oversight fr om the chief diversity officer, the commissions may hold annual (or periodic) town meetings of their constituencies to identify issues that require university attention, evaluate progress in achieving equity and diversity goals, and make recommendations to the President . c. recrui TmenT And reTenTion Excellence at the university depends on the recruitment and retention of outstanding faculty and staff . Talented individuals with great potential are found among ev ery group . To build an academic community that is preeminent, the university will activ ely seek and aggressively recruit these outstanding and diverse individuals to our faculty, staff, administrative ranks, and student body . The university has taken action in recent years to remo ve impediments to effective recruiting and retention of faculty . For example, new policies recognize the needs of faculty inv olved in child-rearing, a concern that has disproportionately affected the careers of academic women . A newly established Family Care Resour ce and Referral Service will provide a variety of child and elder care services to facilitate greater work-life balance for faculty, staff, and students . In 2009-10, the university also instituted a policy for part-time status of tenured/tenur e-track faculty due to childrearing responsibilities, enabling faculty with young children to work part-time . Research and experience have shown that achieving a critical mass of colleagues is especially impor tant in recruiting individuals from groups who are not in the mainstream . If many individuals from a particular group find suppor t and success in a department or unit, others from that group will be more eager to join them . It will be our goal, at every level, to build the critical mass that signals the U niversity of Maryland is a welcoming home for every individual who aspires to reach his or her highest potential . The promotion of cluster hires and a renew ed emphasis on mentoring of junior faculty will help ensure success in building the corps of minority and women faculty across the university . Likewise, the university will support efforts to r ecruit, retain, and promote diverse staff members, and to overcome unfair barriers to their advancement . The university 's recruitment strategies over the past two decades at the undergraduate level have reaped rewards and successes . We are proud of the steady enr ollment of African Americans and Asian Americans, of the increasing numbers of Hispanic American/Latino/a students attending the university, and of the numbers of women in our programs . Innovative r ecruitment efforts at the undergraduate level will continue . The university's strategic plan set forth goals for suppor ting graduate students, casting a wide net in their recruitment that should greatly help to attract minority students and women, and offer them the highest level of mentoring and guidance . We expect steady increases in the enrollment and success of div erse graduate students as a result of these new measures . GOAL C.1: The univer sity will continue to recruit, promote, and work to retain a diverse faculty and staff. Strategies A . The Office of the Provost and college/schools will implement faculty recr uitment strategies, such as cluster hiring, faculty exchanges with minority-serving institutions, and programs that build the pipeline of future faculty, to increase faculty diversity and create an inclusive community that facilitates retention . A faculty recruitment fund will provide suppor t to enhance the diversity of the university's faculty . 51019 recommendations B . The university will join the Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (herc ) to incr ease its competitive advantage in recruiting talented and diverse faculty and staff, and to identify potential positions for their family members . C . The chief diversity officer will work with deans and department chairs to determine the availability of women and minorities in targeted fields, and to ensure that depar tments are making efforts to hire diverse faculty and staff in proportion to their availability in relevant job pools . D . The Office of the Provost, deans, and chairs will develop mentoring, pr ofessional growth, and other retention initiatives, such as collaboration caf\u00e9s, to reduce disparities in the retention rates of tenure-track and tenured faculty from diverse groups . Administrators should replicate best practice models from departments that hav e been successful in retaining and promoting faculty of color, and should provide mentorship training to faculty who choose to become mentors . E . The chief diversity officer will monitor faculty retention and promotion/tenure rates, identify impediments to retention and adv ancement, and make recommendations for remedying identified disparities . F . Deans and department chairs will carefully evaluate campus service assignments and mentoring activities of junior faculty , with a particular focus on women and minority faculty, and will ensure that they have time to successfully complete their teaching and research responsibilities required for promotion and tenure . G . The chief diversity officer will monitor staff retention, promotion, and turnover rates, identify barriers to car eer advancement, and make recommendations for remedying identified obstacles . H . The university will implement family-friendly policies and provide services to facilitate work-life balance as r etention incentives . GOAL C.2: The university will r ecruit, retain, and graduate a diverse student body. Strategies/Undergraduate Students A . The Division of Academic Affairs will adopt innovative, high-contact r ecruitment models, including those that employ alumni of color and international alumni, to attract a diverse student body from all areas of the state, the nation, and the world . The university will set appropriate goals for increasing enrollments . The university will increase the percentage of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups (African American, Asian American, Hispanic American/Latino/a, N ative American, and multiracial) to a target of at least 38% of the total enrollment by 2018 . 51120 the university of maryland The university will increase the percentage of international undergraduate students to a target of at least 8% of the total enrollment by 2018 . B . The university will continue to create scholarship and financial aid programs to ensure that higher education is accessible to diverse undergraduates, par ticularly low- income, first-generation students . C . The Division of Academic Affairs will support initiatives that enhance the academic preparation of lo w-income, first- generation students during their pre-college years, and that encourage their college attendance . D . The university will regularly review its 27 admission factors, including academic achievement, standar dized test scores, and other criteria, to ensure that admissions procedures do not negatively impact women, minority, and low- income students . Members of the university community should make every effor t to share information about the individualized, holistic evaluation of student applicants to the university . E . The university will work to close the academic achievement gap by bringing the graduation rates of African American, Hispanic American/Latino/a, and N ative American students in line with those of the general student body . Specifically, the university will reduce the discr epancy between the six- year graduation rate of students from the above groups and that of all students to 5% or lower by 2018.F . The university will continue to support offices and programs that facilitate undergraduate student success, progress to degr ee, and timely graduation, including those that provide smooth transitions to campus life, mentoring advising, and positive academic and co-curricular experiences . Strategies/Graduate Students A . The Graduate School and deans will develop innovative pr ograms to recruit, enroll, and retain diverse graduate students, and increase their degree completion rate . The Graduate School and colleges and schools will educate graduate directors and other interested faculty on best practices for recruiting, retaining, and graduating div erse students . Colleges and schools will periodically review and provide feedback on department plans for recruiting a diverse student body . B . The provost and Graduate School will consider the success of its programs in r ecruiting and graduating a diverse population of graduate students when allocating institutional financial support to programs, departments, and colleges and schools . 51221 section name : section sub-headrecommendations d. educATion Consistent with the goals of the strategic plan, the university strives to provide every student with an education that incorporates the values of diversity and inclusion and prepares its graduates for an increasingly diverse United States and evolving global society . Curricula should ensure that graduates have had significant engagement with different cultur es and global issues . The new general education plan spells out clearly the courses and curricula that will be required to broaden the vision of all undergraduates . Innovative ne w diversity courses will increase students' understanding of cultural pluralism, develop their cultural competencies, and provide exceptional opportunities to study abroad . In addition, the university has many outstanding scholars whose work has focused on diversity issues within their disciplines . To name just a few, our School of P ublic Health has a major research focus on the reduction of health disparities in Maryland's minority populations, our history faculty and students have traced historic connections between African American slavery and the Maryland Agricultural College (which grew into the University of Maryland), and our education scholars regularly conduct studies with urban schools in Prince George's County and Baltimore that have large minority populations . University faculty from many disciplines have made impor tant contributions to the scholarship on diversity and self-identity . These and many other programs can be given campus-wide publicity and tapped to provide educational experiences for undergraduates . Through a collaborative process, the university will consider ho w best to incorporate the study of diversity and different cultural perspectives in its academic programs, courses, and co-curricular programs . Students will gain knowledge of intellectual approaches and dimensions of diversity , develop an understanding of diverse people and perspectives, and recognize the benefits of working and problem-solving in diverse teams . Programs and activities that promote cross-cultural understanding will help to pr epare students for careers in a global economic environment and life in a multicultural society . GOAL D.1: T he university will ensure that undergraduate students acquire the knowledge, experience, and cultural competencies necessary to succeed in a multicultural, globally interconnected world.Strategies A . The university will implement the new general education plan with Diversity requir ements that increase undergraduates' knowledge of diversity issues, understanding of pluralistic societies, engagement with peers from diverse backgrounds, and multicultural competencies .

Faculty will work with colleagues from Student Affairs to develop innovative co-curricular experiences, such as ser vice- learning, common ground dialogue programs, internships, and international experiences that equip students to work and live in diverse communities . e. reseArch And schol Arship The university's record is filled with instances of ground- breaking scholarship that illuminate the experiences of women, minorities, and other diverse groups in America . In departments such as Women 's Studies, African American Studies, Government and Politics, and Family Science, as well as Journalism, Theatre, and Music (which recently commissioned Shadowboxer, an opera on the life of Joe Louis), research has investigated issues of ethnicity, culture, sexuality, religion, gender, age, disability, and a wide range of other identities . Other research focuses on application of theory to practical situations . In the College of Education and College of Computer, Mathematical and N atural Sciences, as well as the A . James Clark School of Engineering, resear chers are identifying the tools for mentoring and teaching specialists in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (stem ) fields, including methods for use in urban communities with large minority and first-generation college populations . Robert H . Smith School of Business scholars study how diversity in management teams contributes to inno vation . Such research is making a difference on campus and in the larger society . Communicating the outcomes of our diversity scholarship in lectures, programs, and events has the potential to energiz e the campus discussion of diversity issues and inspire research by other faculty and students . This plan calls for multiple strategies that will strengthen, augment, and enhance opportunities for research and scholarship in diversity fields . In addition, every academic and co-curricular unit will be encouraged to incorporate diversity- r elated topics, themes, and concerns into their curricula . Such efforts will greatly enrich the educational experience of faculty and students, as well as other members of the univ ersity community . GOAL E.1: The univer sity will commit itself to developing and supporting the production of nationally recognized research and scholarship on race, ethnicity, class, gender, and other dimensions of diversity.Strategies A .

The Graduate School will maintain and publicize an up-to- date list of fellowships and outside sources of support fr om funding agencies and foundations that are specifically for minority and female graduate students . 51625 section name : section sub-headrecommendationsF. communi Ty engAgemen T Community engagement has been an underlying theme in several of the goals listed above . The vision that animates this plan is of a university characterized by intellectual vitality and excitement, wher e individuals from different backgrounds, ethnic groups, national cultures, socioeconomic groups, and life experiences can share ideas and concerns . This would be a university in which students actively engage with other students, faculty, and staff in both formal and informal settings . The Diversity Advisory Council will pr omote community engagement by sharing examples of other successful campus models . For example, students on the university's S ustainability Council and its student subcommittee share environmental concerns and tackle sustainability issues with faculty and staff from the divisions of Academic Affairs, Administrative Affairs, Student Affairs, Research, and University Relations, and the Office of Information Technology . Such engagement enriches the educational experience and leads to personal growth . It builds trust among participants, supports cr eativity, enlivens intellectual life, and creates an ambiance that is characteristic of the great universities . The university's reach and involv ement extend beyond the physical boundaries of the campus . The neighboring communities and regions provide valuable r esources for learning and personal growth . For example, the Department of Public and Community H ealth has maintained a 10-year partnership with the City of Seat Pleasant, with faculty, staff, and students providing health education services to residents and residents offering feedback on the department's health education curriculum . College Park Scholars partners with the City of College Par k to provide weekly tutoring for children through the Lakeland Stars program serving Paint Branch Elementary School . Other community-based activities are described in the plan, but much, much more interaction takes place between the univ ersity and communities throughout the state . Learning experiences include departmental internships, alternative break programs, ser vice-learning, and field experiences for credit or for learning, such as Engineers Without Borders, which takes our students to other countries . Engagement in educational, research, and service activities in communities bey ond the campus is an important vehicle that broadens perspectives and increases understanding of the value of diversity . This plan supports university efforts to promote such engagement . GOAL F.1: The univ ersity will promote academic and co- curricular activities that facilitate positive interactions among students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Strategies A . The university will create and support opportunities that facilitate dialogue and engagement among diverse students, faculty , staff, and alumni, and that contribute to the professional, social, economic, and spiritual development of all participants . B .

Initiatives will reflect the university 's values of diversity, equity, inclusion, and citizenship with the goal of developing the \"whole student .\" The university will showcase innov ative and effective initiatives as models for replication . GOAL F.2: The univer sity will increase the number of part- nerships and the quality of engagement with the diverse external community. Strategies A . The colleges and schools, Institute for Internal Programs, and Division of S tudent Affairs will provide increased opportunities for students to participate in community- based internships, service learning, international exchange programs, and related activities that enhance their knowledge of diverse populations and their cultural competency . B . The university will create new community-based research, continuing education, and extension par tnerships, as well as leverage existing partnerships, that benefit diverse populations in the state and surrounding areas . 51726 the university of maryland 51827 implementationV . Implementation \u00bb This diversity plan proposes a leap forward at the University of Maryland over the next 10 years . Like the university's 2008 strategic plan, it sets high expectations and offers a framewor k and guide for the university as it fulfills aspirations for future excellence in becoming a model of diversity and inclusion . Its vision and initiatives represent a bold and ambitious agenda for the university . The goals and strategies recommended in this plan must be thoughtfully and carefully implemented . The role of the chief diversity officer and the Diversity A dvisory Council will be crucial to the success of the implementation . They will need to prioritize the proposed goals and strategies, develop a realistic timetable, and assign the plan 's specific tasks to offices or individuals responsible for executing them . Their success will depend, in part, on their ability to seek the advice and counsel of expert and engaged faculty, staff, and students from acr oss campus as they pursue these goals; their willingness to support bold initiatives; and their acceptance of patience and flexibility in finding ways to achieve their goals . Future, not yet anticipated opportunities or challenges may cr eate a need to modify individual goals and strategies, or create new ones . Yet the vision of a university community that thrives on div ersity, that uses diversity as an educational instrument for personal growth and enrichment, and that cultivates future leaders who embrace diversity will not change . It remains our fixed star . GOAL 1: There will be guiding principles developed for the implementation c omponent of the diversity strategic plan. These principles will be developed by the chief diversity officer in consultation with the Diversity Advisory Council. A . The president, provost, vice presidents, deans, depar tment chairs, directors, and the chief diversity officer should use the diversity strategic plan for planning and decision making related to campus diversity issues . B . The chief diversity officer should work with the university's senior leadership to dev elop incentives for implementing strategies presented in the plan . C . The chief diversity officer, in consultation with the Diversity Advisor y Council, should develop measures to monitor and evaluate the success of plan goals and strategies . GOAL 2: The university will prioritize and set a time line f or the goals and objectives of the diversity strategic plan. The chief diversity officer, president, and provost will: A . Annually identify high-priority strategic plan goals and strategies for implementation . B . Identify the individuals/units responsible for implementing and evaluating the progress of prioritiz ed goals and strategies . C . Establish realistic time lines and outcome measures for implementing high-priority goals and strategies . D . Work with the vice president for University R elations and appropriate development officers to seek financial sources to fund the goals and strategies of the plan . 51928 the university of maryland GOAL 3: The chief diversity officer will monitor imple- mentation of the diversity str ategic plan and will report annually on plan progress. A . The chief diversity officer will annually report on the progress of the div ersity strategic plan to the president and the president's Cabinet . B . After presentations to the president and Cabinet, the annual progress repor t of the diversity strategic plan will be posted on the university website and released to the university community, including the Student Government Association, the Graduate Student Government, the University Senate, and The Diamondback . GOAL 4: The universit y will develop processes for modify- ing the diversity strategic plan and updating it at least once every 10 years. A . Members of the university community will have an opportunity to petition for major and/or minor amendments to the diversity strategic plan . Major amendments will require r evisiting the goals and strategies of the plan or the basic assumptions that have provided direction for the plan . A major amendment would have an impact on many areas of the plan . Minor amendments might include a change in the wording of a goal or strategy, or changes in responsible leadership . B . The president will appoint a diversity strategic plan steering committee to complete a major review and update of the diversity strategic plan no less than once ev ery 10 years . C . The chief diversity officer will chair the diversity strategic plan steering committee . D .

Loh | President FROM Daniel Falvey | Chair, University Senate Approved: Date: UNIVERSITY SENATE LEGISLATION APPROVAL | # 17-18-03 Approved by the Senate on April 24, 2018 523 Inclusion and Respect at the University of Maryland ISSUE In the last few years, the University has been confronted with many of the same issues that have emerged across the country. Concerns about the infiltration of hate groups, incidents that have diminished the experience of many of the members of our campus community, and a significant tragedy that has forever changed our community have led to a collective call for action. Members of our community have expressed concerns about safety and security; transparency; and the impact of hate/bias incidents on our campus. In response to these concerns, President Loh and the University Senate created the Joint President/Senate Inclusion & Respect Task Force to review these concerns, consider our existing practices, and develop a comprehensive plan for initiatives on prevention and education, improving campus climate, responding to incidents motivated by hate, and upholding the pillars of our academic mission within legal guidelines. RECOMMENDATION (S) The Inclusion & Respect Task Force makes recommendations for a comprehensive diversity and inclusion initiative in nine areas: (I) Values of the University, (II) Prevention & Education, (III) Hate/Bias Incident Response, (IV) Centralization, (V) Communication, (VI) Evaluation & Assessment, (VII) Free Speech & Freedom of Expression, (VIII) Current Policies and Guidelines, and (IX) Resources & Implementation as shown in the attached report. TASK FORCE WORK The Task Force gathered information on campus climate, reviewed campus policies and procedures for response to hate/bias incidents, assessed efforts to provide prevention and education training and the effectiveness of those programs, reviewed scholarly research on bias in higher education, reviewed peer institution data, considered how to address the intersections of free speech and hate speech in campus policies, considered how campus messaging and communication could be used to promote an inclusive campus atmosphere , and explored strategies for fostering a campus environment that is intolerant of hate and bias. Throughout its work, the Task Force engaged members of the campus community, holding three campus-wide open forums, meeting with faculty, staff, and student groups, and consulting with a variety of administrative units involved in programming and implementation of diversity efforts. The Task Force deliberated on guiding PRESENTED BY Co-Chairs Ja'Nya Banks, Lucy Dalglish, Warren Kelley REVIEW DATES SEC - April 6, 2018 | SENATE - April 24 , 201 8 VOTING METHOD In a single vote RELEVANT POLICY/DOCUMENT See Report for More Information NECESSARY APPROVALS Senate, President UNIVERSITY SENATE TRANSMITTAL | #17-18-03 Joint President/Senate Inclusion & Respect Task Force 524 principles, developed and refined recommendations, and consulted with administrators and offices that may be impacted by the recommendations.

ALTERNATIVES The University could continue with its current efforts in the areas of diversity and inclusion programming, hate/bias response, and campus climate assessment. RISKS There are no known risks to the University if these recommendations are implemented. FINANCIAL IMPLICATIO NS The University will need to provide the necessary resources for the development and implementation of all of the elements of these recommendations. 525 INCLUSION AND RESPECT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND Ja'Nya Banks (Co-Chair , Undergraduate Student, SGA (Co-Chair , Dean , Philip of Journalism ) Warren Kelley (Co-Chair , Assistant Vice President, Division of Student Affairs ) Oscar Barbarin (Faculty , Department Chair, African -American Studies ) Lillia Damalouji (Undergraduate Student , College of & Social Sciences ) Zein El -Amine (Faculty , College ) Rosanne Hoaas (Non-Exempt Staff , University of Maryland Police Department ) Luke Jensen (Exempt Staff , LGBT Equity Center, Office of Diversity & Inclusion ) Diane Krejsa (Ex-Officio , Office of General Counsel ) Roz Moore (Exempt Staff , Division of Student Affairs ) Vincent Novara (Faculty , University Libraries ) Ishaan Parikh (Undergraduate Student , College of Computer, Mathematical, & Natural Sciences ) Melanie Pflucker (Graduate Student , GSG Diversity Rashawn Ray Sociolog y) Ana Sanchez -Rivera (Graduate Student , College of Behavioral & Social Sciences ) Timea Webster (Non-Exempt Staff , Office of Diversity & Inclusion ) Roger Worthington (Chief Diversity Officer , Office of Diversity & Inclusion ) March 30, 2018 2017-2018 Task Force Members Date of Submission UNIVERSITY SENATE REPORT | #17-18-03 Joint President/Senate Inclusion & Respect Task Force 526TABLE OF CONTENTS EXECUTIVE to Speech and Conduct ................................ ................................ ............................... 11 RESEARCH AND FINDING ................................ ................................ ........................... 18 Legal Framework on Speech and Conduct in Higher Education ................................ ................................ ...................... 19 ISSUES & CONCERNS ................................ ......... 21 Task Force to be Addressed ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ ........ 27 VII.

The Task Force gathered information on campus climate, reviewed campus policies and procedures for response to hate/bias incidents, assessed efforts to provide prevention and education training and the effectiveness of those programs, reviewed scholarly research on bias in higher education, considered how to address the intersections of free speech and hate speech in campus policies, considered how campus messaging and communication could be used to promote an inclusive campus atmosphere , and explored strategies for fostering a ca mpus environment that is intolerant of hate and bias. What we heard from the campus community Task Force members met with hundreds of faculty, staff, and students through town hall meetings, conversations with representative faculty, staff, and student g roups , and individual meetings with stakeholders. Among the consistent messages heard from those groups and individuals were: Recent campus hate/bias incidents have caused faculty, staff, and students to be concerned about their safety and the safety of others on campus. Despite data that show that the University provides a safe environment, there is a difference between being safe and feeling safe. There is a lack of understanding of the experiences of minority members of the campus community. Hate grou ps are increasingly targeting campus communities with propaganda and persuasion, largely using social media channels. Many students believe that campus leaders are not con cerned about hate/bias incident , nor do they understand student fears. Despite numero us administration efforts in recent years to address diversity and inclusion on campus, there is a lack of transparency in how the campus handles hate/bias incidents that gives the impression nothing has been done. Students, in particular, are frustrated t hat they hear about hate/bias incidents from outside sources before they receive information from the University. The University does not fully appreciate the importance of social media when communicating information about incidents. There is a lack of coo rdination between campus units and no central source of information, making it difficult to find information on current diversity and inclusion programming and resources. Faculty and staff do not have the tools necessary to facilitate dialogue on issues of hatred and bias in the classroom and in the workplace. Due to cultural differences, international students may need additional outreach. Faculty, staff, and students repeatedly voiced doubt that the Task Force recommendations would be implemented. 528Task Force members made the following conclusions There is no consistent understanding among faculty, staff, and students of what the University's values are or what it means when campus leaders say certain conduct or speech violates University values. There is substantial concern with the way the administration communicates with audiences and the tone it sets when hate/bias incidents occur on campus. Diversity programming is not comprehensive and does not have a broad overarching vision. The University must d o more to demonstrate its commitment to safety and must act assertively against threatening and intimidating conduct. At the same time, it must do more to promote civility and respect to foster an environment where free inquiry and debate can occur. There is a lack of understanding of how to balance free speech that is protected by state and federal laws with speech that is considered conduct that can be punished as a crime or as a violation of University policies. Our recommendations The Task Force recommends numerous actions, including those highlighted below. The University should: Policies, Guidelines, and Procedures Adopt the proposed Values of the University, which should be ingrained into the experience of each member of the campus community an d reinforced throughout their time at the institution. (p. 23) Adopt the proposed Policy on Threatening and Intimidating Conduct. (p. 3 1) Adopt the proposed Statement on Free Speech Values, promoting intellectual and academic freedom and recognizing that o ffensive speech that hurts, offends, or discredits may be protected by state and federal laws. (p. 28) Other recommended actions Develop a comprehensive prevention and education initiative on diversity, inclusion, and respect for all members of the campus community that includes content areas such as implicit bias, cultural competency, bystander intervention, and civic engagement. The initiative should draw upon expertise from campus scholars and should be administered by the Office of Diversity & Inclusion (ODI) . (p. 2 4) Develop a strategy for communicating information related to equity, diversity, and inclusion that is transparent, timely, and responsive to the concerns raised by the campus community. When serious verified hate incidents occur on campus, t he University's leadership should denounce offensive speech or conduct that does not align with its core values. Likewise, when outside speakers engender hatred, University leadership should make clear that the speakers' messages violate University values. (p. 26) Provide opportunities for faculty, staff, and students to engage in meaningful counterspeech. (p. 28) Use the ODI website as a central resource for information about diversity -related programming, events, policies, data, climate reports, and repor ting processes, as well as resources related to free speech, expression and demonstrations on campus. (p. 2 6) Consolidate all hate/bias incident reports and publish them on the ODI website, including the resolution of verified reports. (p. 2 6) Conduct biennial climate surveys of faculty, staff, and students. (p. 2 7) Refer review of campus policy and related guidelines on the use of physical facilities and demonstrations by outside groups to the Senate's Campus Affairs Committee. (p. 28) Develop a phased implementation plan and provide the necessary resources for implementation of the Task Force recommendations. (p. 3 0) 529INTRODUCTION The citizens of our country are diverse, and they reflect a variety of socioeconomic backgrounds, perspectives and outlooks, political viewpoints, and lived experiences. The diversity of perspectives in our nation is informed by our history of slavery and segregation as well as the subsequent struggles for civil rights and equality. While civility and respectful discourse have always been civic virtues, their use and role have been challenged in recent years. There has been a surge in hate crimes and bias incidents across the country, leading many to believe that our country has not progressed as far as it seemed. The changing p olitical landscape has emboldened some to engage in racially and religiously motivated acts and expressions of hate that undermine the pillars of our society. While free speech and freedom of expression have been major tenets of the constitutional rights a fforded to our citizens, some have used these rights to convey hatred without consideration of the impact that those statements have on their community. Institutions of higher education have not been immune to these issues. Colleges and universities have seen a significant increase in hate crimes and incidents motivated by biases related to an individual's protected class, as in their race, national origin, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, or disability (Bauman 2018). In addit ion, hate groups have increasingly targeted recruitment efforts and propaganda at campuses across the country (Kerr 2018). Higher education institutions are struggling with the balance between fostering civil discourse and promoting academic freedom with u pholding speech that is offensive but still protected under the First Amendment (Patton 2017; Kerr 2017). While we have made progress towards inclusion, we need to be informed by our past in order to move forward. Diversity alone does not create opportuni ties for inclusion or understanding across differences. The challenge that the country and the University of Maryland face is not just one of diversity, equity, and inclusion , but also one of unity and creating a greater sense of belongingness. BACKGROUND The University of Maryland is a world -class public research institution with a thriving community of faculty who are leaders in their fields, staff committed to supporting the University's mission, and 40,000 academically talented students. The University is committed to excellence through fostering education, critical thinking, and intellectual growth; creating and applying new knowledge via research, scholarship, and the creative arts; enhancing the economic development of the state; and improving the su rrounding community, nation, and world. The diversity of our faculty, staff, and students is a cornerstone of that excellence. The University's pursuit of excellence is bolstered by its strong commitment to secure and maintain a working and learning enviro nment in which all members of its community are welcomed, feel safe, and can flourish, regardless of race, color, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, political affiliation, socioeconomic background, or disability. In the last few years, the University has been confronted with many of the same issues that have emerged across the country. Concerns about the infiltration of hate groups, incidents that have diminished the experience of many of the members of our campus community, and a significant tragedy that has forever changed our community have led to a collective call for action. Members of our community have expressed concerns about safety and security; transparency; and the impact of hate/bias incidents on our cam pus. In response to these concerns, President Loh and the University Senate created the Joint President/Senate Inclusion & Respect Task Force (the \"Task Force\") to review these concerns, consider our existing practices, and develop a comprehensive plan for 530initiatives on prevention and education, improving campus climate, responding to incidents motivated by hate, and upholding the pillars of our academic mission within legal guidelines. The Task Force is led by Ja'Nya Banks, Student Government Association (SGA) Diversity Committee Chair; Lucy Dalglish, Dean of the Philip Merrill College of Journalism; and Warren Kelley, Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs. The membership of the T ask Force includes representatives of the major campus constituencies (undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty, staff, and alumni) and includes faculty and staff with expertise relevant to the work of the Task Force. While the Task Force is repr esentative of major constituencies, from its formation it acknowledged that it is not representative of the experiences of the entire campus community. The Task Force endeavored to incorporate the perspectives of a variety of campus stakeholders into its work in order to better understand their individual experiences and to develop recommendations that reflect their complex needs. DIVERSITY -RELATED IN ITIATIVES The University of Maryland has long embraced diversity as a core value and counts a diverse commu nity among its greatest strengths. The University is committed to building an inclusive community that is enriched by differences, brings together people from the widest array of backgrounds and perspectives, and recognizes that excellence cannot be achiev ed without diversity. In 2010, the University reaffirmed that commitment by establishing the Diversity Strategic Plan - Transforming Maryland: Expectations for Excell ence in Diversity and Inclusion . This P lan aligns with the University's Strategic Plan and sets forth strategies to achieve an environment for all members of the University community that acknowledges and celebrates diversity in all of its dimensions. Since 2010, the University has made great strides towards achieving the goals outlined in the Diversity Strategic Plan. These efforts were predicated on the establishment of the Office of Diversity & Inclusion (ODI) and the Chief Diversity Officer position. I n the past eight years, ODI has led the University's major diversity initiatives. In the past year, the University has continued its commitment to diversity by developing a variety of new initiatives and by committing significant resources into supportin g diversity efforts more fully. The Chief Diversity Officer position is being elevated to vice president status to emphasize the value that the University places in this role. In addition, the University has established the Center for Diversity and Inclusi on in Higher Education (CDIHE), which will serve as a national leader in research, policy, professional standards, and consultation for institutions across the country and abroad on critical issues related to diversity, inclusion, and social justice in hig her education. The University has also committed resources to diversity -related educational efforts such as expanding the cultural competency sections in the General Education curriculum, f inding ways to provide civics education, and developing training op portunities for incoming students. New systems to respond to hate/bias incidents have been developed, through the newly established Hate/Bias Incident Reporting Response Protocol and the Hate/Bias Response Team as well as the creation of the Hate/Bias Response Pro gram Manager role. The University has shown its commitment to developing diversity amongst the faculty ranks by establishing the Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship, whic h provides opportunities for underrepresented minorities to prepare for faculty roles in academia and improves the pipeline of diverse faculty available for faculty positions and the Senior Hire Program, which provides opportunities to recruit senior under represented minority faculty to Maryland. The University's 531leadership is also committed to learning how to identify the infiltration of hate groups through training opportunities from the Anti -Defamation League (ADL). In addition, the University has recent ly initiated a review of its General Education curriculum diversity requirement to ensure that it is meeting its intended goals. While we have made progress in these areas and the University has committed to action, the Task Force was formed to do a comprehensive review of University policies and practices to ensure that we have the tools and systems in place to address our current needs and develop future diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. CHARGE The President of the University and the Chair of the University Senate jointly charged the Task Force on August 25, 2017. The Task Force was asked to consider how best to nurture a campus climate that is respectful and inclusive, stands against hate, and reaffirms the values that define our University . Specifically, the Task Force was asked to gather information on the campus climate, including existing climate data and anecdotal information about campus concerns; review existing policies and procedures for the immediate response to an investigation of hate/bias incidents; assess current efforts to provide prevention and education programming to faculty, staff, and students and their effectiveness in creating an inclusive campus environment; review scholarly research on bias in higher education; review and assess best practices at peer institutions; consider how to address the difficult intersections of free speech, hate speech, and freedom of expression in University policy and practice; consider how messaging and communication should be used to promote an inclusive campus environment; develop a statement on the University's core values and consider how such values can be reinforced over time; and develop strategies for fostering a campus environment that is intolerant of hate and bias. The complete char ge to the Task Force is included in Appendix 1 . In developing the charge, the President and Chair of the Senate focused the Task Force's work on programming efforts and initiatives primarily outside of the classroom. Consider ation of opportunities to refine and better utilize diversity, equity, and inclusion themes in the curriculum, such as through General Education requirements, is an important task that should be led with singular focus by the faculty. A review of curricula r opportunities through General Education has been initiated and will move forward independent of the Task Force's work. TASK FORCE WORK The Task Force began its work in September 2017 and divided its work into two phases. In Fall 2017, the Task Force focused on gathering information related to its charge. The Task Force created five working groups on Climate, Policies & Procedures, Prevention & Education, Hate/Bias Response, and Free & Hate Speech, and began gathering information specific to each area, including scholarly research, guidance on legal frameworks, and best practices in higher education. The Working Groups began an exhaustive study of practices at peer institutions to inform their processes. During Fall 2017, each Working Group examined c urrent policies, procedures, and practices in their specific areas. The Climate Working Group gathered existing data from climate -related research conducted by the Campus Assessment Working Group (CAWG) and worked with the Office of Institutional Research, Planning, and Assessment (IRPA) to analyze and understand these data. The Prevention & Education Working Group conducted interviews with faculty and staff who design 532and deliver programming related to diversity, equity, and inclusion for the University co mmunity, in order to better understand current practices, goals, and challenges. The Hate/Bias Response Working Group consulted with administrators and offices who are currently involved in responding to and/or investigating reports of hate/bias incidents on our campus, including administrators in ODI, the Office of Civil Rights & Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM), the Office of Student Conduct (OSC), and the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD), as well as Resident Life. The Free & Hate Speech Working G roup worked closely with the Office of General Counsel (OGC) and reviewed all campus policies, procedures, and guidelines related to speech and expression. The Task Force held three open forums in the fall semester to hear the concerns of the campus comm unity and ask for suggestions on how it should address its charge. The Task Force solicited feedback through an online form for those who were unable to attend the open forums or who felt uncomfortable sharing their views and experiences publicly. The Task Force also reached out to and met with specific constituency -based groups for feedback, including the University Senate, Student Government Association (SGA), Graduate Student Government (GSG), Residence Hall Association (RHA), Black Faculty -Staff Associa tion (BFSA), and a group of non -exempt staff from Dining Services. The Task Force participated in a Design Thinking Workshop assisted by members of the Academy of Innovation & Entrepreneurship in order to use empathy to identify problems and to find creati ve ways to develop and test solutions to those problems. In the second phase of work beginning in January 2018, the Task Force began developing recommendations and consulting with faculty, staff, and students as well as relevant offices on its preliminar y directions. The Working Groups presented their findings and recommendations to the Task Force in late January 2018. The Task Force began refining the recommendations and deliberating on guiding principles that should be the basis of recommendations in ea ch of the relevant areas. In February and early March 2018, the Task Force presented initial reports on preliminary directions to the University Senate, SGA, GSG Executive Board, RHA Executive Board, the Academic Leadership Forum, and other stakeholder gro ups. The Task Force considered and incorporated feedback from each group as it refined its recommendations. In addition, the Task Force co -chairs and staff spent the beginning of the spring semester consulting with administrators and offices that may be impacted by the recommendations or that may have specialized information for the Task Force on how to reach pa rticular populations through the recommendations. These efforts included consultations with the Office of Faculty Affairs (OFA), University Human Resources (UHR) (including Learning and Talent Development as well as the Office of Staff Relations), the Teac hing and Learning Transformation Center (TLTC), the Office of International Student & Scholar Services (ISSS), the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, the Office of Undergraduate Studies (UGST), the Orientation Office, and the Graduate School (GRAD). The Task Force co -chairs updated the President and Chair of the Senate as it developed its recommendations, in order to ensure that its recommendations aligned with the charge, were reasonable, and could be implemented. The Task Force unanimously approved it s final recommendations on March 29, 2018. CURRENT PRACTICE Early in its review, the Task Force began gathering information on existing practices, policies, programming, and data related to diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts as well as on the University's initial response and investigation processes for hate/ bias incidents. A summary of its findings in various areas is included below. 533Prevention & Education The University currently offers a wide variety of opportunities to engage in diversity -related programming for members of the campus community. Academic a nd administrative units including the Department for Fraternity & Sorority Life (DFSL), the Division of Student Affairs, Multicultural Involvement & Community Advocacy (MICA), the University Health Center, and ODI among others across the campus, provide a variety of programs in this realm. In a large university such as ours, programming opportunities of this nature can be highly decentralized. This can foster creativity and ownership but can also lead to a lack of a cohesive vision or strategy for continual improvement in these types of initiatives. Many of those who develop and deliver existing programs raised concerns about programming assessment, decentralized registration, and follow -up for participants. Response to Hate/Bias Incidents Hate/bias inciden ts are acts that focus on a characteristic such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, political affiliation, or physical or mental disability, among others. Hate/bias incidents may involve offensive speech and expression that are protected by the First Amendment, and though not all hate/bias incidents include acts that rise to the level of a crime, they may involve conduct that can be addressed through administrative and/or legal action. The University es tablished the Hate/Bias Incident Reporting Response Protocol in November 2017 to establish practices for responding to hate/bias incidents, in order to provide support to the University comm unity in response to incidents and to take action on any conduct t hat is inconsistent with the University's policies and values. ODI recently established a new Hate/Bias Response Program Manager position to provide support to individuals affected by hate/bias incidents and to formulate action plans for responding to th e incident, working in partnership with the newly -established Hate/Bias Response Team. The Hate/Bias Response Program Manager will share data about incidents with UMPD and other campus units and maintain a log of hate/bias incidents online. Reports of su spected hate/bias incidents currently can be made online to the Office of Civil Rights & Sexual Misconduct (OCRSM) or to UMPD can be reached by calling 911 , 301-405-3333 , or dialing #3333 from a cell phone . Upon receiving a report, UMPD will begin an inves tigation and send confidential notifications to administrators who need to be aware and who may facilitate any necessary immediate action while UMPD conducts an investigation. During the investigation, UMPD considers whether there is an element of hate o r bias to the incident, using factors and indicators established in the Maryland State Police Protocols . After the investigation concludes, UMPD wil l classify the incident as to its status as a hate/bias incident. A \"verified\" incident means a reasonable person would conclude that the act was motivated in whole or in part by bias against a person or group due to their membership in a protected class. An \"inconclusive\" incident is where the evidence is incomplete or conflicted and the incident cannot be verified. \"Unfounded\" incidents are those where the incident did not occur or it was not motivated by bias. The status of the incident will be recorded on the daily crime log on the UMPD website. If UMPD finds a perpetrator and determines that the incident was a hate crime according to federal and state law, it will review the incident with the State's Attorney to consider criminal charges. If an incide nt involving faculty, staff, or students is classified as a verified or inconclusive hate/bias incident, UMPD refers the matter to the University through the Office of Faculty Affairs, University Human Resources, or the Office of Student Conduct for admini strative review. 534While processes for reviewing referrals involving hate/bias incidents are evolving, the Office of Student Conduct already has a well -defined administrative review procedure in place for cases involving students. Upon receiving a referral for student conduct associated with hate/bias incidents, the Office of Student Conduct (OSC) may pursue charges for violation of the Code of Student Conduct. The OSC will review the report for reasonable cause and to establish whether the conduct would be a violation of the Code . The OSC will conduct its own investigation to review any evidence or information in the referral or available from the UMPD or facult y, staff, or students impacted by the case. Cases are resolved through a disciplinary conference with an administrator or through a hearing by a student conduct board. Students have the right to appeal the finding and the sanction if their case was heard b y a board. During the sanctioning process, the Director considers any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, and will also consider whether the conduct was motivated by hate or bias - if so, that will be considered an aggravating factor, which may result in a stricter sanction. While hate/bias incidents can occur anywhere on campus, a number of reports have been made in residential communities, where reporting is encouraged and supported by the Department of Residence Life (Res Life). Since the vast maj ority of incidents in the residence halls are related to subtle bias, ignorance, or impulsivity, Res Life focuses on community restoration and coming together through dialogue in its response to incidents. In cases where a perpetrator can be found, Residen t Directors typically hear lower -level cases and the case is referred to the Office of Rights and Responsibilities (R&R) if it could result in a disciplinary action. The R&R team uses the Code , the Residence Hall Rules, and the same protocols as the OSC in resolving cases. Climate The University has regularly assessed faculty, staff, and student perceptions of the campus climate from a variety of dimensions over the years. These assessments have provided information on the status of the campus climate over time , and have in some cases provided data used for evaluating specific initiatives. A number of existing initiatives that provide data and assessment related to campus concerns have been used to study campus climate from a diversity perspective. The University's Campus Assessment Working Group (CAWG) was formed to develop a campus \"Culture of Evidence\" in which data and assessment play a key role in campus decision making. CAWG regularly gathers and exchanges information about the faculty, staff, a nd student experience at the University. The data can feed directly into program and campus improvement efforts. Departments and administrators take advantage of these data collection efforts to ask questions that are necessary to their own improvement eff orts. CAWG works on developing strategies for sustainable data collection to continue moving the University forward in its status as the flagship campus. In March 2016, the University launched the Thriving Workplace Initiative as a means to data to create a thriving work environment and a culture of engagement and inclusion among all University employees. This important ongoing initiative , led by the Office of the President and the University's Center for Leadership and O rganizational Change (CLOC), intend s to share survey results with academic and administrative units on campus; create an action plan that is based on best practices, research, and assessment; and implement that action plan through training, development, and personalized consultations in ord er to promote a thriving workplace. This important initiative examines inclusion in the workplace, broken down demographically, and seeks data on the drivers of more inclusive environments. The principles of this initiative recognize that engaged employees 535work with passion, feel a profound connection to their workplace, and are empowered to succeed while helping the University reach its full potential. In Spring 2017, the Graduate School initiated the Graduate Student Quality of Life survey to better understand multiple facets of the graduate student experience. The results from the survey were released in January 2018. These results provide an analysis of graduate student engagement with the University, other students, and faculty; an analysis of graduat e student interactions with and perceptions of the faculty and the department; and data on how well students felt that the program prepared them academically and professionally. In February 2018, the University initiated a Campus Climate Survey, an onlin e survey used to assess the campus living, working, and learning environment, including the level of equity and respect among faculty, staff, and students. This population -level comprehensive survey is the first of its kind at the University. The goal of t he survey is to use the results to help shape a more inclusive, diverse, and safe community. Policies and Procedures Related to Speech and Conduct The Task Force reviewed all University policies related to freedom of expression, use of space, and demonst rations. The University has several policies, procedures, and guidelines that support free speech and freedom of expression on our campus. The VI-4.10(A) University of Maryland Procedures for the Use of Physical Facilities provides guidance on procedures for the use of campus facilities by units within the University, members of the campus community, and student organizations, as well as public use by others outside the University. The University's Guidelines on Demonstrations and Leafletting recognize the right of indivi dual faculty, staff, students, and student organizations to demonstrate and leaflet, provided such activities do not disrupt normal activities or infringe upon the rights of others. The University's Chalking Guidelines provide guidance on approved surfaces at the University that can be used by faculty, staff, and students for creating chalk messages. The University's Freedom of Expression: Policy and the Law Resource Guide (1991) recognizes the particular importance that the University, as an institution of learning, places on the free exchange of ideas. It also states the University's commitment to open, vigorous deba te and speech. Additional relevant policies and procedures include the VI-1.10 University System of Maryland Policy on Acts of Violence and Extremism , VII-11.00(A) University of Maryland Faculty and Staff Workplace Violence Reporting and Risk Assessment Procedures , VI-1.00(B) University of Maryland Non -Discrimination Policy and Procedures , and the Division of Intercollegiate Athletics regulations on Prohibited Items & Behavior . RESEARCH AND FINDING S Scholarly Research The Task Force reviewed scholarly research from multiple perspectives as it considered the various elements of its charge. Research related to diversity and inclusion ha s focused on areas such as effective elements of diversity initiatives, efforts to promote racial climate, the balance of free and hate speech, and principles for diversity programming. 536Diversity & Inclusion Efforts in Higher Education Diversity in hig her education is no longer solely focused on affirmative action based on race. Research shows that a three -dimensional model of diversity in higher education with a broadened focus that recognizes characteristics of identity, constituency groups, and insti tutional initiatives is more applicable today (Antonio & Clark, 2011; Epperson, 2011). This model (Figure 1) serves as an organizational framework and conceptual guide for diversity research and practice in higher education. Figure 1. Three -dimensional model of higher education diversity (Worthington 2012) Research has focused on the keys to successful diversity and inclusion efforts and the impact of general diversity in higher education. Comprehensive diversity and inclusion efforts involve more than simply counting people; they address a multitude of iden tities; consider intersecting aspects of identity and include and benefit everyone. Diversity on college campuses is associated with greater learning; increased interpersonal competencies; greater self -confidence among students; fewer racial prejudices; gr eater gains in critical thinking; and greater involvement in civic and community service (Antonio, 2001; Chang, 1996; Gurin, 1999; Hurtado, 2001; Smith et al., 1997). The factors that are considered to be threats to diversity and inclusion efforts, as well as those that support diversity and inclusion efforts are identified in Figure 2 below. 537Figure 2. Keys and Threats to Diversity and Inclusion Efforts Positive Racial Climate Diversity has been shown to have an impact in promoting a positive racial climate on campuses in a variety of dimensions. The major contributing factors to a positive racial climate are the inclusion of students, faculty, and administrators of color; a cur riculum that reflects the historical and contemporary experiences of people of color; programs that support the recruitment, retention, and graduation of students of color; and an institutional mission that reinforces its commitment to pluralism. In additi on, four climate -related factors internal to and within the control of individual colleges and universities include compositional or structural diversity; the psychological and behavioral dimensions of the climate; and an institution's history and legacy o f inclusion (Hurtado, et al., 1998; 1999). The three thematic clusters of findings from an analysis of 15 years of institutional research on campus climate show differential perceptions of campus climate by race; minority student reports of prejudicial t reatment and racist campus environments; and benefits associated with campus climates that facilitate cross -racial engagement (Harper and Hurtado, 2007). The major themes from a multi -campus qualitative investigation shows cross -race consensus regarding in stitutional negligence; race as a four -letter word and avoidable topic; self -reports of racial segregation; gaps in social satisfaction by race; white student overestimation of minority student satisfaction; reputational legacies for racism of the institut ions; the pervasiveness of whiteness in space, curricula, and activities; the consciousness -powerlessness paradox among racial/ethnic minority staff; and the unexplored qualitative realities of race in institutional assessment (Harper and Hurtado, 2007). Research on Free Speech and Hate Speech Universities must work to balance free speech protections with other interests, such as creating an inclusive environment and educating the campus community about the difference between the 538intent of hate speech an d the impact of hate speech. It is important for campus community members to clearly understand the constitution, state laws, and individual rights, as well as the university's stance on these issues. Research shows that universities should \"explore non -disciplinary/punitive responses that would provide support and education to all parties involved\" (Miller et al. 2017: 7). Miller and colleagues (2017: 8) suggest that universities should engage in \"educ ational moments\" by helping students and the broader campus community have vehicles to respond to speech they consider offensive. Miller and colleagues (2017) found that: \"...administrators must carefully consider and evaluate their roles related to prote cting free expression while also working to create campus environments conducive to dialogue about diversity and bias.\" (p. 11) \"...bias response teams should provide ongoing education on legal issues in higher education with a specific focus on free spee ch as well as campus -level policies, which function as one component of regular training that could also address contemporary issues of diversity and bias on campus.\" (p. 11) Diversity Programs Scholarly research shows that most universities and organizat ions support diversity programs. Dobbin, Kalev, and Kelly (2007) found that nearly 40 percent of the 829 companies they surveyed have diversity training. Roughly 20 percent of the companies have diversity evaluations, diversity task forces, and networking programs. Only about 10 percent of the companies have a diversity manager and mentoring program. In developing diversity programs, research suggests that the following questions should be considered. Should Diversity Programs be Mandatory? Yes, if other programs are mandatory. Research shows that making training programs, whether diversity -focused or otherwise, required is an ineffective strategy (Dobbin and Kalev 2016; Johnson 2017). It should be noted that organizations and companies make programmatic e fforts mandatory all of the time. If mandatory trainings are the status quo, a diversity program should be no different. In fact, research shows that if something is included as a normal requirement, it is not perceived negatively. When diversity is incorp orated as a normal part of the organization, people are more accepting of it as a key component of the organization. In turn, they are more open to diversity training. After participating in diversity trainings, employees actually report that diversity is more important for their jobs and important for their organization (Hanover and Cellar 1998). What leads to the Success of Diversity Programs? Leadership participation. In a survey from 785 human resource professionals, Rynes and Rosen (1995) examined wha t factors determined the adoption of diversity programs and perceived training success. They found that top administrative support and administrators' belief in diversity initiatives increases the adoption of diversity program and perceived training succes s. Also, the existence of a diversity manager/liaison, diversity -related policies, and the clear prioritizing of diversity goals related to other priorities increases adoption and perceived success. Contrary to other research, Rynes and Rosen found that pe rceived training success increases when diversity programs are mandatory for upper management, when there is a long -term plan for evaluating training results, policy changes, and 539diversity goals, as well as a reward structure for administrators and departm ents for adhering to diversity goals. Subsequent research found similar results (Dobbin, Kalev, and Kelly 2007). Unfortunately, diversity trainings are typically disaggregated from policy changes that directly address organizational concerns (Dobbin and K alev 2016). Diversity has to be part of the entire organization for changes to be institutionalized. In addition to trainings, diversity has to be formally incorporated into strategic plans, mission statements, and award and incentive structures. An organi zational diversity program should include diversity trainings, internal communications, resource commitments, accountability for violating rules and regulations related to tolerance and respect, and comprehensive programs that can focus on a range of margi nalized identities. Are Bystander Intervention Strategies Effective? Yes, with the ability to practice strategies. Bystander intervention has been shown to be highly effective. In a large study including nearly 13,000 high school students, Polanin, Esplag e, and Pigott (2012) found that bystander intervention programs decreased bullying in schools. Allies and bystanders are frequently able to connect with perpetrators in ways that victims and survivors cannot. Unfortunately, bystanders often do not have enough data points or experiences to allow for them to practice implementing bystander intervention strategies. Analysis of National Trends Assessments conducted by national advocacy and research organizations generally indicate a recent rise in hate/bias incidents and hate crimes across the country, which is supported by assessments of FBI crime data. For instance, FBI crime data from the 201 6 reporting year indicate a 5 percent rise in hate crimes overall; hate crimes based on race, religion, and against the LGBTQ communities were the three protected statuses targeted most frequent ly in 2016 reports (ADL 2016; ADL 2017). Trends related to ha te/bias incidents indicate that there has been an increase in activity that promotes bias, especially related to white nationalism and racism, on college campuses. The Anti - Defamation League (ADL) Center on Extremism tracked 346 incidents of white supremac ist propaganda on colleges campuses from September 1, 2016 to February 1, 2018. The number of incidents during the fall 2017 semester alone demonstrated a dramatic rise, with an increase of 258 percent when compared to incidents in the same time period in fall 2016 (ADL 2018). Analysis by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) suggests that higher education has become a target for white nationalist groups because it tends to be very vocal about its commitment to diversity, tolerance, equality, and social justice. Racist propaganda seen on college campuses attempts to demonize these values as an attack on white identity and history in the name of political correctness. In addition, the SPLC suggests that college students are seen as prime targets for recrui tment, since they are typically inquisitive and open to accepting new and sometime s radical ideas (SPLC On Campus 2017). Both the SPLC and the ADL have advocated for more action by higher education administrators, faculty, staff, and students to prevent these incidents and provide more education and training to community members. The ADL provides a host of educational resources for university settings , including fact sheets, Q&A guidance documents, and training programs, and provides resources to help ins titutions identify and counter emerging threats. In October 2017, the SPLC developed a guide to bystander intervention, which provides training tools for individuals on how to step in when public harassment and violence occur on campus (SPLC On Campus 2017 ). The SPLC has also 540advocated for college leadership to be vocal about their institution's commitment to diversity & inclusion and to speak out against actions on their campuses that go against their values (Cohen 2017). Peer Institution Research In the course of its work , the Task Force conducted an extensive review of practices and policies at Big 10 and other peer institutions, seeking best practices and lessons learned from their experiences. The institutions included in the review were: University of Illinois Urbana -Champaign, University of Iowa, University of Michigan, Michigan State University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University, Ohio State University, Pennsylvania State University, Rutgers University, University of Nebraska, Univers ity of Wisconsin, University of California -Berkeley, University of California -Los Angeles, and University of North Carolina -Chapel Hill, among others. An overview of the Task Force's findings is included in Appendix 3 . Common themes and practices in multiple areas emerged in the review of Big 10 and peer institutions: Most peer institutions have incorporated some form of programming for incoming & transfer students. Programs range from a general overview of diversity, equity, and inclusion themes with an introduction to basic terms and concepts, to innovative workshops that explore some of the foundational skills needed to collaborate, learn, and work in diverse environments. Programs vary as to whether they are online or in p erson. Cultural competency education is a component of diversity training at many peer institutions, and often relies on dialogue programs and sharing lived experiences as a means of learning about and understanding systems of privilege and oppression whi le building community. Programs on bystander intervention, examination of implicit biases, and difficult dialogues in the classroom for instructors have been developed at some peer institutions. Some institutions are beginning to develop badging/certific ation programs for faculty, staff, and/or students that include a diversity component. These initiatives typically include a series of workshops or activities where strategic knowledge, skills, and competencies are developed, and after completion, particip ants receive some type of certificate to demonstrate their commitment and competence as a leader in diversity, equity, and inclusion. Most institutions have begun initiatives to survey campus climate in terms of diversity, equity, and inclusion on an annu al or biennial basis. As most institutions are in the early stages of developing and launching campus climate surveys, most are still developing their plans for how to utilize the information collected. Some institutions plan to share campus climate resul ts with the campus community and a few have made results public. A few institutions have defined core values and principles for its campus community, and use those values and principles in messaging and communications strategies in order to instill those values in the campus community. Every institution has a slightly different approach to reporting, investigating, and resolving reports of hate and bias incidents. Most universities have specific units or response teams dedicated to handle incidents of hat e and bias. Reporting an incident may be done via email, phone call, online, or face to face, depending on the institution. A few institutions allow reporting of incidents in more than one location on campus, including specific locations that are familiar service and support centers for specific identity and affinity groups. All of the institutions surveyed prohibit discrimination, harassment, and threats in some way through various campus policies on non -discrimination, student conduct, and/or workplace 541policies. Some institutions provide definitions of hate/bias incidents in online resources, but none give such definitions in policy documents. More than half the universities actively initiate outreach programs to help communities that may be impacted by a hate/bias incident, even if they were not directly targeted or involved in the incident. Some universities prepare detailed reports on hate/bias incidents on campus in order to provide timely and transparent information and to better understand the campus climate. These reports vary in the level of detail included - some institutions include o nly incidents that have been verified where an individual was found responsible, while others include all incidents that have been reported with an explanation of whether they were unfounded or verified to be hate/bias incidents. Nearly all institutions have policies or executive -level statements on protecting freedom of expression; academic freedom is often linked to freedom of expression in these statements. None of the institutions specifically ban hate speech, though some institutions are more specifi c about what types of speech are in fact conduct that may be actionable. All institutions reviewed have policies and procedures that guide the use of facilities and spaces on campus for assembly, discussion, or protest. Many have restrictions on who may reserve indoor or outdoor space and restrict the ability of outside groups to initiate or host events. Many institutions also have designated outdoor areas for free assembly by university or non -university groups for protests or demonstrations on campus. Some institutions provide guidance on counter -protests and/or appropriate/inappropriate ways to protest controversial speakers. A few provide guidance on how university police can support student groups that wish to protest. Nearly all institutions have polic ies or procedures on chalking, hanging posters, or otherwise writing messages on campus surfaces. Most institutions do not allow for the removal of messages based on content. Existing University Climate Data The Climate Working Group of the Task Force rev iewed existing data from past Campus Assessment Working Group (CAWG) climate surveys. The Working Group also reviewed preliminary results of the Graduate Student Life survey, including more detailed responses to diversity -themed questions in the survey. Th e recent Campus Climate Survey administered by ODI closed at the end of February 2018, so the full results were not available in time to inform the work of the Task Force. CAWG climate survey results included data on perceptions of the University's divers ity from freshmen (2015), juniors/seniors (2015), and alumni (2007 & 2015). In addition, the Working Group reviewed survey results on student perspectives on campus community climate (2003), LGBTQ environment (2014), student perception of cultural awarenes s and diversity (2010), senior experience on academics, diversity, and transition (2000), and alumni experiences on diversity & community responsibility (2006). The Working Group also requested further analysis of the data on student experiences to focus o n key settings in which the University effectively provides opportunities for its student to interact with diverse groups and opportunities that are most widely used by subgroups of students who differ by ethnicity, major, and experience with diversity pri or to attending the University. An analysis of the student survey data provided a variety of insights. The University provides students opportunities for interactions with individuals from different backgrounds through a variety of mechanisms, including h ousing arrangements and campus employment. Overall, the results of 542the survey suggest high prevalence of student interaction with diverse groups through each of these mechanisms. A majority of student respondents experienced interactions with other groups through these settings. Living and Learning programs seemed to offer less experience with diversity than other settings. Student respondents commonly reported involvement in discussion about racial issues in their courses at the University - 60 to 70 per cent of student respondents. However, student respondents in a few colleges such as the sciences reported less discussion of these issues , likely because the nature of these courses do not lend themselves naturally to such discussions. This suggests that alternative routes and approaches may be needed in order to increase the exposure of students in these disciplines to issu es of diversity (e.g., through General E ducation requirements). A high proportion of student respondents - about four out of every fi ve students - report personal efforts to get to know those belonging t o groups other than their own. At the same time, only about one in three respondents reported participation in events and activities sponsored by groups reflective of other cultures. Par ticipation in these events was reported by 27 percent of white respondents, 32 percent of Latino respondents, and 40 percent of African -American respondents. The personal or social barriers to this form of boundary -crossing deserve greater attention. Never theless, in almost all groups, a very high proportion of respondents reported feelings of comfort (89 percent) and a sense of belonging (82 percent) at the University of Maryland. The results from African -American students is an exception and deserves ad ditional attention and consideration. In results related to a sense of comfort and belonging, about 26 percent of African - American students did not feel that they belonged and 24 percent of African -American respondents reported that they have felt disrespe cted. By comparison, the frequency of disrespec t is only 4 percent among white students and 11 percent among Latino students. Although most African - American students did not feel disrespected, a substantial minority of them did. In addition to feeling as though they did not belong and were disrespected, a similar number felt that race was a barrier to their participation at the University of Maryland. Most students, two -thirds of respondents of all ethnicities, valued diversity as a goal and saw it as a benefit of attending the University of Maryland. The benefits of diversity discussed included developing comfort and interacting with other groups, empathy, perspective -taking, and the ability to work together to communicate and negotiate cross -cultural con flict. Hate/Bias Incidents in Higher Education In assessing incidents that occur on college campuses, it can be very difficult to determine whether an incident is motivated by hate or bias. The totality of the circumstances in the case are critical to determining if a hate/bias incident occurred; in two contexts, the same conduct could be viewed in vastly different ways. UMPD's investigation reviews indicators and factors that could prove or disprove a bias motivation for the alleged conduct. UMPD conside rs the perception of the victim, if they volunteer evidence or information that suggests the incident occurred because of their membership in a protected class. In order to confirm a hate/bias incident has occurred, there has to be evidence that would indi cate to a reasonable person that the perpetrator's motivation was related in whole or in part to the victim or target's protected status. In some cases, incidents at the University are reviewed for administrative action by the Office of Civil Rights and S exual Misconduct (OCRSM) as potential violations of the University's Non - Discrimination Policy, while others are addressed through other avenues. The Non -Discrimination 543Policy prohibits discrimination based on a protected class. However, in order for an in cident to be found to be discrimination under the Policy, certain elements need to present; the conduct has to be severe or pervasive, and it has to effectively deny an individual or group their right to a specific benefit or service at the University. Typ ically, discrimination has to involve conduct by an agent of the University in order to be reviewed under t he Non -Discrimination Policy , since actions by students would not constitute the University failing to provide an equitable learning and living envir onment. The Task Force felt it is not helpful to classify the hate/bias incidents that the University has seen in recent months using a discrimination paradigm o r the Non -Discrimination Policy for resolution. Hate/bias incidents may be isolated but impactful and involve actionable conduct such as threats or intimidation targeted in such a way that they create an immediate sense of harm or fear. Though it would likely not be possible to make a discrimination case for these incidents, other University policies and procedures can and should address this conduct. The Task Force determined that existing provisions in the Code of Student Conduct and the Policy on Workplace Violence touch on this type of conduct, and determined that the University would be b etter served by a policy that addresses threatening and intimidating conduct by faculty, staff, and students. While a new policy would address specific actionable conduct involving threats or intimidation, conduct that involves patterns of behavior, action s or inactions by faculty, staff, and administrators that deny services to individuals or groups, and conduct that is repeated and persistent would likely still be reviewed as discrimination by OCRSM. While several campus units are involved in responding to hate/bias incidents, there is a continuing need for greater coordination among these units, to ensure appropriate application of University policy as well as to provide an immediate and effective initial response to hate/bias incidents. In addition, sy stems are needed to address campus concerns that the University community is not adequately informed in a timely fashion about reported incidents and their disposition. Legal Framework on Speech and Conduct in Higher Education Free and Hate Speech Defi ned As a public institution, the University of Maryland is a state agency, and its actions must comply with the United States and Maryland constitutions and with Maryland statutes. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution ensures an individual's right to free speech and protects the right to express ideas and opinions without restriction. As a government agency, the University may not restrict or punish speech. Institutions of higher education are meant to be places where the exploration of new and challenging ideas is celebrated. An environment that fosters the free exchange of ideas and open, vigorous debate is critical to the educational mission of all universities, including the University of Maryland. It is impossible to nourish intellectual grow th, nurture innovation, and advance knowledge without engaging in dialogue, sharing different perspectives, and learning from each other. While the First Amendment is critical to ensuring this culture of inquiry thrives, it also protects an individual's ri ght to say offensive, insulting, and hateful things. Hate speech is defined as speech that offends or insults individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, political affiliation, o r phy sical or mental disability , or other characteristics. It is often characterized by the use of words which are deliberately abusive or insulting, directed at vulnerable minorities and calculated to stir up hatred. It can undermine self - 544esteem and cause isol ation. While hate speech should be discouraged, hate speech is also protected by state and federal law, and as such, cannot be restricted by the University. In cases involving hate speech, it is important to distinguish between speech that is protected an d conduct that can be actionable. Some speech is accompanied by conduct, such as assault, vandalism, or threats to incite violence, which may be actionable through administrative processes or criminal charges. Regulation of Hate Speech The First Amendment allows the regulation of threats of bodily harm or death; intimidation or harassment; speech that incites imminent lawless action, such as the use of fighting words; and libel and slander. In Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), the Supreme Cour t held that the constitutional guarantees of free speech permitted an exception where advocacy was directed to \"inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\" In other words, mere advocacy of hate cannot be banned unless it is an incitement to imminent lawless action. In Virginia v. Black (2003), the Supreme Court ruled that true threats are not protected by the First Amendment, such as when a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm. Courts have also allowed reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions of speech if there is a significant government interest in doing so. The restrictions must be content and viewpoint neutral and must leave open ample alternative means for speak ers to get their views across. The restrictions must also be clear enough for an ordinary person to understand. The restrictions must be tailored in a way that does not simply ban all speech, both protected and unprotected speech, or they will be struck down as overbroad. Speech and Expression on College Campuses Beginning in the 1990s, more than 350 colleges and universities adopted rules or codes restricting hate speech. To date, every court to consider a campus speech code has declared it unconstitutional. Attempts to create a speech code or otherwise sanction offensive speech would not be appropriate for the University. A classic example involved the rules at the University of Michigan, which in 1987 tried to enact a Hate Speech Code after a series of horrendous racial events on campus. The Court recognized this was a laudable university effort. Nevertheless, the policy was so broad and vague that it was impossible to discern any limitation on its reac h. The terms \"stigmatize\" or \"victimize\" in the policy were too vague and swept within its scope a significant amount of what was unquestionably protected speech. Moreover, simply because speech stigmatized or victimized an individual did not, in and of it self, strip it of protection under the First Amendment. Research and history show that in instances where speech codes were enforced, they were often used to silence marginalized groups. There have been many instances where the majority or those in power have used speech regulations intended to deter offensive speech to prevent those in the minority or in marginalized communities from using speech to promote their interests. There have also been many cases where marginalized communities have successfully m oved their agenda forward due in large part because of the protections of the First Amendment. Research shows that empowering marginalized communities to exercise their free speech rights has led to positive outcomes. Counterspeech has proven to be an effective method to oppose speech that advocates for hate. While hate speech is protected, individual faculty, staff, and 545students; the administrative leadership; and campus or student organizations should be empowered to engage in counterspeech on the issues that are important to them. The campus community should use the resources, locations, and methods outlined in University policy and in guidelines on demonstrations to promote their interests. ISSUES & CONCERNS Campus Community Concerns Throughout the course of its review, the Task Force solicited feedback from members of the campus community and key stakeholders to better understand major issues and concerns. The primary themes that emerged from multiple campus -wide op en forums, targeted meetings, and other sources of feedback are outlined below: General Faculty, staff, and students are concerned about their safety and the safety of others on our campus. There is a lack of understanding of the experiences of minority members of the campus community. Many are concerned about the prevalence of racist propaganda and the impact of recruitment efforts by hate groups. Hate/Bias Incidents There is a perception that while students are concerned about incidents that happen on campus , the administration is not concerned or does not understand student fears. There has been a lack of transparency in how the administration addresses hate/bias incidents, which can give the impression that nothing has been done. Inconsistent data an d information given to the campus community on incidents at the University gives the impression that these incidents are not taken seriously. There are concerns that those perpetrating hate/bias incidents are not being sanctioned. There are concerns about how to support those impacted by hate/bias incidents and the affected community. Programming It can be difficult to find information about current programming because there is no coordination between units and no centralized source of information about pr ogramming. There is no collaborative process for units to work together on programming. Training is not effective unless it is engaging and interactive. The University is not reaching students who are not already engaged in diversity efforts. Faculty and staff do not have the tools they need to be able to challenge and facilitate dialogue on hateful attitudes and statements that occur in their courses. International students may need additional outreach to understand what we consider to be hate speech , a hate symbol , or prohibited conduct . Free Speech It can be difficult to develop an objective standard that respects free speech on both sides of an issue. There are concerns about how to find a balance between the right to free speech and the need to restrict actions that incite violence and hate. 546Communication There is no consistent understanding among faculty, staff, and students of what the University's values are and what it means when the administration says that certain conduct or speech go against University values. There are concerns with the way that th e administration communicates with internal audiences and the tone that it sets when hate/bias incidents occur on campus. The University does not effectively speak out against hate/bias incidents and hateful speech, and often chooses to communicate in a wa y that indicates support for offensive ideas by labeling it as free speech. Students are not receiving information from the University but instead are hearing about it from other sources first. The University does not recognize the importance of social med ia when communicating information about incidents. Implementation There is a perception that the University will not follow through on implementing any of the Task Force's recommendations. Task Force Assessment of Issues to be Addressed The Task Force ac knowledges these concerns and understands the impact that hate/bias incidents have on our campus. Hate/bias incidents are insidious acts that can create fear, anger, and intimidation, for not only individuals directly affected, but also entire communities. Hate/bias incidents can create fractures in the social fabric of the campus, feed intolerance, and tarnish the University far beyond its borders. It is essential that the University act decisively and unequivocally in denouncing hate incidents, and take a ction where these acts are prohibited conduct. The University should assure the campus community that their safety and ability to pursue their academic and work -related goals is a high priority. Data shows that the University of Maryland is a safe environ ment, and the University has taken additional steps in the past few months and years to increase safety measures on campus. However, there is a distinction between being safe and feeling safe, and the Task Force recognizes that many members of our campus c ommunity do not feel safe due to the rise in hate/bias incidents. The University needs to do more to demonstrate its commitment to safety and must act assertively against threatening and intimidating conduct. The University must act just as assertively t o ensure that intellectual and academic freedom, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression are protected on our campus. The University's mission is to discover and disseminate knowledge, which requires the ability to challenge norms and engage in dialog ue across differences. To sustain its mission, the University should vigorously support the marketplace of ideas. At the same time, the University must do more to promote civility and respect to foster an environment where free inquiry and debate can occur . The University should be committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment to enable all of its members to pursue their academic, personal, and professional goals. 547GUIDING PRINCIPLES The Task Force believes the University should make a strong commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion through its words and actions. The following principles should provide the foundation for the University's efforts to achieve this goal. Active engagement in creating a safe environment where i ndividual opinions are valued and free and open exchange of ideas is without retribution. A University -wide commitment to values common to us all, with opportunities for continued reexamination and contemplation throughout an individual's time at the Unive rsity. Engagement of all members of the campus community, including University leadership, in embracing and communicating the importance of the University's values. Understanding the critical role that free speech and freedom of expression play in an educational environment, as well as of our role in using speech as an instrument of civic engagement . A commitment to promote civility and respectful treatment of all members of the campus. A comprehensive a nd coordinated approach to diversity, equity, and inclusion programming that is a part of the University experience for every member of the campus community. Programming that includes a blend of mandatory and voluntary engagements, offered in a variety of formats and through different modes, that complements curricular and professional learning and development objectives. A coordinated response strategy to hate/bias incidents that provides support to affected communities while assuring all faculty, staff, and students the ability to pursue their academic and professional goals in a safe environment. Policies and protocols that enable the University to take action against threatening and intimidating conduct. An engaged communication strategy that encoura ges campus leaders to speak out against hate speech that does not align with the University's values. Education and tools that empower faculty, staff, and students to use speech to combat hate and bias on campus. Centralization and alignment of informatio n in one comprehensive website. Transparent structures for sharing hate/bias incidents and climate survey data. Accountability and engagement by campus leaders at all levels. Ongoing evaluation and assessment of diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts t o enable continuous growth. 548TASK FORCE RECOMMEND ATIONS The Inclusion & Respect Task Force makes the following recommendations in nine areas: (I) Values of the University, (II) Prevention & Education, (III) Hate/Bias Incident Response, (IV) Centralization, (V) Communication, (VI) Evaluation & Assessment, (VII) Free Speech & Freedom of Expression, (VIII) Current Policies and Guidel ines, and (IX) Resources & Implementation. I. Values of the University The University should adopt the following values statement, which should be ingrained into the experience of each member of the campus community and reinforced throughout their time at t he institution. The University of Maryland (UMD) is a community of individuals living and working together to support and advance the educational and research mission of the institution. We aspire to become a community that is: United, Respectful , Secure and Safe , Inclusive , Accountable , and Empowered and Open to Growth . United We are diverse but have much in common. Members of the UMD community foster a sense of belonging based on acceptance and a unity of purpose. We strive toward overlapping goals, sharing resources, and spending some of the most significant and productive times of our lives together in a common space. To that extent we depend on one another and are our best selves when we support one another. Accordingly, our actions are guided not only by what is good for self but also by what is good for all. Respectful Members of the UMD community interact with others in ways that promote feelings of respect. All members of the UMD community are valued equally and deserving of respect without reg ard to their status, their educational attainment or their social position. We reject denigration of any member through words or actions and resist stereotyping of members that undermines personal dignity though slurs, slights, insults or other acts that d isparage individuals or groups. Secure and Safe Members of the UMD community refrain from injustice, violence, harassment, intimidation, and aggression. We do all that is possible to protect and defend members of the UMD community from anyone who would ha rm them physically or psychologically. We promote individual agency and responsibility in contributing to personal safety, avoidance of harm and staving off the effects of insults, slander, intimidation, or symbolic intimation of violence. Inclusive The UMD community strives to achieve the highest levels of excellence in our work and our studies that accrue through inclusive practices. We recognize that as a thriving and striving community, the success of our institution and our members is dependent on h ow well we value, include, and engage all members. This belief must be actively and consistently embedded in every aspect and practice of the UMD community. 549Accountable All members of the UMD community are equally responsible and committed to uphold th e University's values to the best of their ability, as well as hold the rest of the UMD community to those responsibilities. We must be transparent in our mistakes, and learn to reflect and continue to strive toward inclusive excellence. Empowered and Op en to Growth Members of the UMD community embrace learning as essential for bettering ourselves as individuals and as a community. We encourage and assist one another to become our best selves. II. Prevention & Education The University should develop a compr ehensive prevention and education initiative on diversity, inclusion, and respect that involves all members of the campus community (faculty, staff, students). The initiative should include a broad vision for diversity programs for the University and shoul d be overseen by ODI. Programming should consist of a blend of mandatory programs and voluntary learning opportunities offered at multiple points throughout a faculty/staff/student's time at the University. This programming should use different modalities and approaches with va rying levels of complexity. Programming content areas should include implicit bias, cultural competence, bystander intervention, navigating difficult dialogues, civics education, effective methods for engaging in counterspeech, and reflection and dialogu e on the University's values. The University should consider utilizing existing models at the University, such as: Sticks+StonesUMD, Speak Up and Speak Out Virtual Reality Bystander Intervention Program, TLTC workshops on difficult dialogues in the classro om, Common Ground, Words of Engagement Intergroup Dialogues, and best practices at peer institutions on implicit association tests, activities at orientation, and badging/e -portfolio systems while developing programming opportunities. The University shou ld consider developing opportunities for members of the campus community to track diversity -related skills and trainings throughout their time at the University. ODI should consider developing a diversity -related suite of training options for faculty and staff in partnership with UHR, OFA, and TLTC using existing trainings as a way to develop a more robust program. ODI should consider developing training opportunities for those in instructional roles including instructional faculty and undergraduate and graduate teaching assistants in partnership with relevant administrative units, including TLTC and the Graduate School. ODI should work with ISSS to incorporate information about our values into existing efforts to help international students and scholars acclimate to our campus culture. ODI should consider ways to partner with ISSS to increase opportunities for peer to peer interaction among international and domestic students, and should consider mechanisms that have been successful in the past, such as ESOL mentorship programs and Language House partners programs. ODI should also consider how educational and programming opportunities could incorporate global perspectives in order to broaden understanding of differences across cultures. 550ODI should contin ue to develop and deliver programming as part of the University's comprehensive prevention and education initiative. ODI should also work collaboratively with representatives from existing University diversity programs in the development and delivery of th e comprehensive prevention and education initiative. The University should utilize existing resources and expertise within our faculty in the development of the comprehensive prevention and education initiative on diversity, inclusion, and respect. The University should provide tools to enable students, faculty, and staff groups to create and sponsor diversity -related programs. III. Hate/Bias Incident Response The Task Force recommends that the proposed Policy on Threatening and Intimidating Conduct immedi ately following this report be approved. The University should develop administrative review procedures to consider UMPD referrals of potential bias -related conduct involving faculty and staff. The University should conduct a review of the VII -11.00(A) U niversity of Maryland Faculty and Staff Workplace Violence Reporting and Risk Assessment Procedures to ensure that it aligns with the Policy on Threatening and Intimidating Conduct and current procedures for responding to hate/bias incidents. The Univers ity should conduct a review of the implementation of the Policy on Threatening and Intimidating Conduct in Fall 2019 to assess its efficacy and make any necessary adjustments. The University should develop a plan to ensure appropriate coordination between the primary units responding to reports of hate/bias incidents that complements the new Hate/Bias Response Protocol and the Policy on Threatening and Intimidating Conduct. Hate/Bias incidents should be reported to UMPD. The University should designate sp ecific offices or units, including ODI, as entry points where m embers of the campus community may disclose incidents prior to engaging with the formal reporting mechanisms through UMPD. The University should provide training for support staff in those unit s to ensure that they are knowledgeable about available resources and how to facilitate reporting to UMPD. IV. Centralization The University should work to achieve a balance between centralization and decentralization of equity, diversity, and inclusion efforts on our campus. Efforts to achieve equity, diversity, and inclusion goals are a responsibility of the entire campus. The ODI website should serve as a central resource for information about the University's diversity - related programming, events, relevant policies and guidelines, data, climate reports, reporting processes, and resources related to free speech, expression, and demonstration on campus in order to increase transparency, accessibility, and discovery of opportunities for engagement. The University should consolidate and centralize information on all hate/bias incidents reported at the University and the outco me of any review of these incidents. The University should consider 551what types of information should be included on each incident and how that information should be communicated to members of the campus community, as well as the mode and the frequency with which it is communicated. V. Communication The University should develop a comprehensive multi -platform communication strategy that prioritizes the dissemination of information related to equity, diversity, and inclusion to the entire campus community in a manner that is transparent, timely, and sensitive to all constituents. The University should consider how to prominently communicate information about diversity programs, events, and trainings and how diversity themes are integrated into the University 's culture. The University should develop a communications and marketing strategy focused on promoting the University's values. The University should consider ways to promote the values to all members of the campus community through different modes and h ow to reinforce them over time. For example, admitted students could receive information about the values in their admission packet and new employees could receive them as part of their appointment information. In addition, themes from the values could be incorporated into social media campaigns, marketing materials, or other existing activities to reinforce what it means to be a Terp over time. The University's leadership should communicate its viewpoint, when appropriate, using messaging that aligns with its core values. In particular, the University's leadership should denounce offensive speech or conduct that does not align with its core values and express that it is not appropriate or welcome in our community. The University should consider how best t o communicate the national context on hate/bias incidents to the campus community. VI. Evaluation & Assessment Programming ODI should develop a strategy for evaluating and assessing diversity -related education and training programs to assess efficacy and mak e necessary changes over time. All diversity -related training programs should have an evaluative component to collect feedback from participants. Climate assessment data should be used to inform and refine programming content. Climate Surveys ODI should conduct biennial climate surveys of faculty, staff, and students to better understand individual experiences in a variety of dimensions. Climate surveys should assess the impact of activities and the outcome of efforts to improve diversity, as well as changes in beliefs and attitudes about race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, political affiliation, or physical or mental disability, over time. Survey design for future climate surveys should be guided by the highest standards, draw upon conceptual frameworks and best practices, and incorporate multiple designs to data collection and 552analyses, including qualitative approaches as well as longitudin al and scientifically valid samples so that robust conclusions can be drawn from its findings. Climate surveys should identify and oversample for specific identity and affinity groups so as to enable the development of targeted interventions that meet th eir unique needs (i.e. ethnicity, residential experiences, students who do not identify or participate with any campus group, and participants of Greek life and student government). Climate surveys should consider paying special attention to evaluating th e experiences of students in majors where the curriculum may not provide opportunities for addressing and understanding issues of diversity. Climate surveys should consider assessing the social impediment to an individual's comfort in attending or taking part in events sponsored by a cultural or affinity group other than their own. The University's leadership should be apprised of and reflect on climate survey results in establishing their agendas and priorities. Existing survey data and feedback from me mbers of the campus community indicate that the African -American population may be more vulnerable in terms of comfort and respect at the University. The University should consider developing specific programs that support vulnerable populations identified in existing and future survey data by integrating them into the University, promoting a sense of safety, and recognizing their contributions. VII. Free Speech & Freedom of Expression The University should adopt the proposed Statement on Free Speech Values as follows: The primary purpose of a university is to discover and disseminate knowledge through teaching, research, and service. To fulfill these functions, a free exchange of ideas is necessary not only within its walls but with the world beyond. The his tory of intellectual discovery and growth clearly demonstrates the need for freedom; the right to think the unthinkable, discuss the unmentionable, and challenge the unchallengeable. Whenever someone is deprived of the right to state unmentionable views, o thers are necessarily deprived of the right to listen to and evaluate those views. Few institutions in our society have this same central purpose. It follows that a university must protect and guarantee intellectual and academic freedom. To do so it must p romote an environment in which any and all ideas are presented. Through open exchange, vigorous debate, and rational discernment, the campus community can evaluate ideas. Every member of the campus community has an obligation to support the right of free expression at the university, and to refrain from actions that reduce intellectual discussion. No member shall prevent such expression, which is protected under the constitutions of the United States and the State of Maryland. The University does not have a speech code. History shows that marginalized communities have successfully promoted their interests because of the right to express their views. In fact, marginalized communities have been silenced by speech codes and other r egulations against \"offensive\" speech. 553In addition to the obligation to promote and protect free expression, individuals assume further responsibilities as members of the university. The campus expects each individual community member to consider the har m that may result from the use of slurs or disparaging epithets intended to malign, for example, another's race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, political affiliation, o r physical or mental disability . While legal protections for free expression may sometimes supersede the values of civility and mutual respect, members of the university community should weigh these values carefully in exercising their fundamental right to free expression. The University value s and embraces the ideals of freedom of inquiry, freedom of thought and freedom of expression, all of which must be sustained in a community of scholars. While these freedoms protect controversial ideas and differing views, and sometimes offensive and hurt ful words and symbols, they do not protect conduct that violates criminal law or university policy. The University should recognize the rights of faculty, staff, and students to engage in counterspeech. VIII. Current Policies & Guidelines The University Sena te should charge its Campus Affairs Committee with an overall review of the Policies and Procedures on the Use of Physical Facilities and the associated guidelines on chalking, demonstrations, and leafletting, working in concert with affected stakeholders. The Campus Affairs Committee should consider how the University can support allowing the rental of facilities within the campus as a way of supporting speech and dialogue. The Campus Affairs Committee should also consider how requests from outside groups should be reviewed and approved. The following revisions to the Non -Discrimination Policy & Procedures (VI -1.00[B]) should be approved to clarify the jurisdiction of the Policy on Threatening and Intimidating Conduct. VI-1.00(B) UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND NON -DISCRIMINATION POLICY AND PROCEDURES (Approved on an Interim Basis by the President October 1, 2015, Amended March 22, 2016, Amended May 6, 2016) II. APPLICABILITY This policy applies to members of the University community, including studen ts, trainees, faculty, staff, and certain third parties (e.g., visitors, volunteers, applicants for admission or employment, vendors, and contractors) while on University property or while participating in University sponsored activities who either carry o ut discrimination or are subject to it. This policy applies to discrimination, harassment, or retaliation: on University premises, in any University facility, or on University property; and/or at any University sponsored, recognized, or approved program, visit, or activity, regardless of location; and that impedes equal access to any University education program or activity or that adversely impacts the education or employment of a member of t he University community regardless of where the conduct occurred .; or that otherwise threatens the health or safety of a member of the University community. 554III.DEFINITIONS \"Discrimination\" is unequal treatment based on a legally protected status that is sufficiently serious to unreasonably interfere with or limit an individual's opportunity to participate in or benefit from a University program or activity, or that otherwise adversely affects a term or condition of the individual's employment or educa tion. \"Harassment\" is a form of discrimination (as defined above) that encompasses unwelcome conduct based on a person's protected status. Harassment is severe or pervasive conduct that negatively affects the particular individual and also would negatively affect a reasonable person under the same circumstances. Harassment in violation of this Policy depends on the totality of the circumstances, including the nature, frequen cy, and duration of the conduct in question, the location and context in which it occurs, and the status of the individuals involved. Harassing behaviors may include, but are not limited to, the following, when based on a person's protected status: The University Senate should charge its Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Committee with a comprehensive review of the Non -Discrimination Policy & Procedures (Appendix 2 ) to consider whether broader changes are needed. IX.Resour ces & Implementation The Task Force recommends that the University provide the necessary resources for the development and implementation of all the elements of a successful comprehensive diversity and inclusion initiative. Specifically, resources will be required to develop programming activities, purchase and/or develop new online training, support expanded education and training, develop an overall communication plan and centralized website, and develop/conduct assessments of programming activities. The Task Force recognizes that the scope of these activities is broad and will require time to fully implement. The Task Force recommends that ODI develop a phased implementation approach for aspects of the recommendations that require significant developme nt, to allow the University the time needed to design and implement various components of the recommendations. ODI should provide an annual report on the implementation of these recommendations to the University Senate and the President's Cabinet. ODI sho uld also track the progress of implementation on its website as a way of communicating to University faculty, staff, and students what actions are being taken to actively develop the institution's efforts on diversity and inclusion. In the spirit of continuous improvement, the University should consider innovative ways to engage faculty, staff, and students in the implementation of these recommendations and future development of diversity efforts on an annual basis. Specifically, the Univ ersity should consider facilitating design thinking workshops through a partnership with the Academy for Innovation & Entrepreneurship and ODI as a way of engaging members of the campus community in generating new ideas for addressing specific problems or questions. 555 Proposed New Policy from the Joint President/Senate Inclusion & Respect Task Force VI-1.00(F) UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND POLICY ON THREATENING AND INTIMIDATING CONDUCT I. Purpose The University of Maryland promotes civility and respectful treatment among all members of its diverse campus community, and fosters the discovery and dissemination of knowledge through the free and open exchange of ideas. The University values and protect s the intellectual and academic freedom, freedom of speech, and freedom of expression of all students, faculty, and staff. The University provides a welcoming and inclusive environment to enable all members of the University community to pursue their acad emic, personal, and professional goals. Threatening or intimid ating conduct directed toward member s of the University community that is motivated by their actual or perceived protected status interferes with these values and commitments, and is therefore p rohibited. II. Prohibited Conduct The University prohibits threatening or intimidating acts motivated in whole or in part because of an individual or group's actual or perceived protected status, including the following: Threats: An expression of inte nt to commit an act or acts of physical violence to a particular individual or group of individuals or to cause damage to their property; or to engage in an act or acts which endangers the health and safety of another person. Intimidation: An act or acts t hat is intended to or that recklessly frightens or coerces and that places another person or persons in reasonable fear of imminent harm. Protected status is defined in state and federal law as well as in the University of Maryland Non -Discrimination Policy and Procedures VI -1.00(B). The Code of Student Conduct V-1.00(B) addresses prohibited conduct by students, including the conduct outlined above. The University of Maryland Faculty and Staff Workplace Violence Reporting and Risk Assessment Procedures VII -11.00(A) addresses conduct prohibited by this policy by faculty and staff. III. Reporting Any member of the University who witnesses or has information related to threatening or intimidating conduct should immediately report it to the University of Maryland Police Department (UMPD). This is especially important because the University's response is limited when it cannot identify those responsible. Reports should be made in good faith. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion (ODI) or other University -designated units and cultural centers can assist faculty, staff, and students with reporting to UM PD. Emergencies and ongoing incidents that require an immediate response should be reported to UMPD at 301-405-3333 Non-emergencies can be reported to UMPD at 301 -405-3555. Reports made online at go.umd.edu/reporthatebias will be responded to within 48 hours. 556 Anonymous tips about reports and ongoing investigations can be submitted online at http://www.umpd.umd.edu/contact/anonymous_tip.cfm . IV. Response to Reports Reports made directly to UMPD will be taken as soon as they are received, and an investigation w ill begin immediately. UMPD will immediately notify relevant campus administrators including ODI to provide necessary information. A. Response from ODI . ODI will coordinate relevant units to respond to the community(s) affected by the incident, develop a n action plan, and provide support. ODI will serve as an immediate resource for students, faculty, and staff, regardless of whether UMPD's investigation indicates that an incident was motivated by protected status. B. Investigation by UMPD. UMPD will con duct an investigation on all reports it receives. In determining whether a specific act or incident constitutes prohibited conduct, the totality of the circumstances will be considered, including whether the motivation for the conduct was based on actual o r perceived protected status and the impact of the conduct on the perceived target. Depending on the outcome of UMPD's investigation, reports will be classified according to Maryland State Police procedures. UMPD will also assess whether a hate crime has occurred, as defined under Maryland state law, and will take steps to initiate criminal charges if appropriate. UMPD will share its findings with ODI and all relevant University offices for consideration of appropriate administrative action. V. Unive rsity Administrative Review Procedures After its investigation is completed, UMPD will make any necessary referrals to relevant University offices for administrative review and will share the facts of the case found through the investigation. University review of referrals from UMPD will be assessed through appropriate processes depending on whether the individual or group identified in the referral is a student, faculty, or staff member . The University's review should determine whether or not the individ ual or group is responsible for engaging in prohibited conduct. A. Students. A student, a group of students, or a student organization identified by UMPD as potentially engaging in prohibited conduct will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct (OSC) for investigation and adjudication. University student disciplinary procedure s and procedural rights established in the Code of Student Conduct will be followed. B. Faculty. A faculty member or a group of faculty members identified by UMPD as potentially engaging in prohibited conduct will be referred to the Office of Faculty Aff airs (OFA), in accordance with VII -11.00(A) University of Maryland Faculty and Staff Workplace Violence Reporting and Risk Assessment Procedures. If an incident is classified by UMPD as verified, OFA will relay the matter to the relevant administrator(s), who will initiate a review of the information from UMPD. C. Staff. A staff member or a group of staff members identified by UMPD as potentially engaging in prohibited conduct will be referred to the Office of Staff Relations within University Human Resources (UHR) in accordance with VII -11.00(A) University of Maryland Faculty and Staff Workplace Violence Reporting and Risk Assessment Procedures. If an incident is classified by UMPD as verified, UHR will relay the matter to the relevant administrator( s), who will initiate a review of the information from UMPD. 557VI. Sanctions If there is a finding of responsibility, sanctions, including discipline, may be imposed. Based on the severity of the prohibited conduct, various actions should be considered, ranging from educational and remedial actions to discipline up to and including dismissal from the University. The University shall endeavor to educate and support students, faculty, and staff in reaching their academic, personal, and professional goals w hile fostering a climate of accountability and responsibility for individual actions. The University's goals are to protect the campus community, deter future offenses, and promote individual accountability. A. Students. Students, student groups, and stu dent organizations found res ponsible for prohibited conduct will face disciplinary and/or educational sanctions as specified in the Code of Student Conduct . B. Faculty. After a finding of responsibility, the relevant administrator(s) will initiate approp riate action. Depending on the circumstances of the case, educational opportunities may be considered. If warranted, disciplinary action may range from termination or suspension to reassignment of duties, in accordance with University policies and employme nt contracts. The relevant administrator(s) should consult with OFA as it determines any appropriate sanctions. C. Staff. After a finding of responsibility, the relevant administrator(s) will initiate appropriate action. Depending on the circumstances of the case, educational opportunities may be considered. If warranted, disciplinary action or corrective measures may range from termination or suspension to workplace modifications, in accordance with University policies and employment contracts. The relev ant administrator(s) should consult with UHR as it determines any appropriate sanctions. VII. Retaliation Retaliation against any individual who makes a report in good faith or participates in an investigation in relation to threatening or intimidatin g conduct is strictly prohibited. Retaliation means an adverse action taken against an individual, where there is a clear causal link between the adverse action and their participation in this process. A report is not made in good faith if it is false or m isleading; was made with the intention to harass; appears to be frivolous; or is otherwise an abuse of the reporting process. Individuals who are alleged to have engaged in retaliation may be subject to disciplinary action. VIII. Resources All members of the University community have access to campus resources to address the effects of threatening or intimidating conduct, including: University of Maryland Police Department. UMPD receives and assesses all reports of prohibited conduct motivated in w hole or in part by actual or perceived protected status. UMPD investigates reports of such prohibited conduct by gathering details, collecting evidence, sharing information with law enforcement partners, and consulting with legal experts. UMPD will communi cate with relevant administrative offices to facilitate the University's response and to make appropriate referrals to begin University disciplinary processes.

III. DEFINITIONS \"Discrimination\" is unequal treatment based on a legally protected status that is sufficiently serious to unreasonably interfere with or limit an individual's opportunity to participate in or benefit from a University program or activity, or that otherwise adversely affects a term or condition of the individual's employment or education. \"Harassment\" is a form of discrimination (as defined above) that encompasses unwelcome conduct based on a person's protected status. Harassment is severe or pervasive conduct that negatively affects the particular individual and also would negatively affect a reasonable person under the same circumstances. Harassment in violation of this Policy depends on the totality of the circumstances, including the nature, frequency, and duration of the conduct in question, the location and context in which it occurs, and the status of the individuals involved. Harassing behaviors may include, but are not limited to, the following, when based on a person's protected status: \u00a7conduct, whether verbal, physical, written, graphic, or electronic that threatens, intimidates, offends, belittles, denigrates, or shows an aversion toward an individual or group; \u00a7epithets, slurs, or negative stereotyping, jokes, or nicknames; \u00a7written, printed, or graphic material that contains offensive, denigrating, or demeaning comments, or pictures; and \u00a7the display of offensive, denigrating, or demeaning objects, e-mails, text messages, orcell phone pictures. \"Personal appearance\" means the outward appearance of any person irrespective of sex with regard to hairstyle, beards, or manner of dress. It shall not relate, however, to the requirement of cleanliness, uniforms, or prescribed attire when uniformly applied for admittance to a public accommodation or a class of employees for a customary or reasonable business-related purpose. \"Retaliation\" refers to action that is taken against an individual because they reported discrimination, filed a complaint of discrimination, or participated in an investigation or proceeding concerning a discrimination complaint. IV. COMPLAINT PROCEDURES Generally, a complaint filed under another University policy or Maryland statute cannot also be addressed under this Policy. Students, staff, and faculty must choose between the different complaint processes available to them. Report for Senate Document #17- 18-03 42 of 56 567VI-1.00(B) page 3A.Reporting Individuals who experience violations of this Policy are encouraged to promptly file a complaint with the OCRSM or bring it directly to the attention of their supervisor. Supervisors, faculty, and University administrators who receive or become aware of a complaint of conduct in violation of this Policy are encouraged to report it to the OCRSM. This does not apply to confidential resources on campus, such as the University Counseling Center, Health Center, Mental Health Services, and University Chaplains. B. Timeliness Complaints must be made within ninety (90) business days of the incident(s). The OCRSM may waive the time limit upon a showing of good cause. C.Initial Assessment Written complaints are encouraged, but not required. If a verbal complaint is made, the OCRSM will prepare a written statement of the allegations and the Complainant will be required to acknowledge its accuracy in writing. The OCRSM will acknowledge receipt of the complaint by sending a notification letter or contacting the Complainant directly within five (5) business days of receipt. The OCRSM will then conduct an initial assessment of the complaint to determine whether the complaint should be investigated, and will consider the Complainant's request that the complaint be investigated or not investigated. The OCRSM will then notify the complainant whether: \u00a7the complaint is appropriately filed with the OCRSM and the OCRSM has jurisdiction over the alleged conduct and the Respondent; \u00a7the complaint has previously been filed under another University policy or Marylandstatute; \u00a7the complaint is suitable for alternative resolution; and \u00a7the allegations, if true, would constitute a Policy violation. If it is determined that the complaint is not appropriately filed with the OCRSM, the Complainant will be informed of the reason. Report for Senate Document #17- 18-03 43 of 56 568VI-1.00(B) page 4D.Alternative Resolution Process When determined appropriate by the OCRSM, the Complainant may elect to resolve a complaint through Alternative Resolution. The purpose of Alternative Resolution is to resolve the complaint by conference and conciliation. The OCRSM will notify and advise supervisors and other administrators, as appropriate, of the complaint and efforts by the parties to proceed with Alternative Resolution. The OCRSM shall document efforts to resolve the complaint and whether or not those efforts were successful. When Alternative Resolution is successful, the OCRSM shall summarize the resolution in writing, have it signed by the parties, and provide signed copies to the respective parties and supervisors and administrators, as appropriate. The OCRSM will also monitor implementation of the resolution agreement and/or close the case. When Alternative Resolution does not succeed within forty-five (45) business days of the date the complaint is filed, the OCRSM will cease that process and begin the investigation process. E. Investigation When the Initial Assessment or a failure of the Alternative Resolution process results in a determination that the OCRSM will investigate the complaint, the OCRSM shall advise the Complainant and Respondent of their rights under this Policy, including the following: \u00a7both parties have a right to an impartial investigation; \u00a7both parties have a right to produce relevant documents, witnesses, and other materialthey would like the investigation to include; and \u00a7both parties may have an advisor of their choice present to provide advice during theinvestigative interview; however, the advisor may not speak or act on behalf of the party. The OCRSM will assign an investigator 3 who will conduct an adequate, reliable, and impartial investigation of the complaint. The investigator will interview the Complainant and the Respondent and any other available relevant witnesses, and review available relevant documents. 1. Standard of Review In making the determination of whether a Policy violation has occurred, the standardof review is \"preponderance of the evidence,\" which means it is more likely than not that a Policy violation occurred. 2. Expectation of Cooperation Absent good cause, all parties and identified witnesses shall cooperate during theinvestigation by being available during reasonable business hours to discuss the 3 An investigator in the OCRSM, for purposes of state employment regulations, is also considered to be the Fair Practices Officer. Report for Senate Document #17- 18-03 44 of 56 569VI-1.00(B) page 5complaint and by making available any relevant information requested by the investigator. 3. Investigation Timeline The OCRSM seeks to complete an investigation within sixty (60) business days andmay extend the time frames set forth in this Policy for good cause. Exceptions to this timeframe may vary depending on the complexity of the investigation, access to relevant parties, and the severity and extent of the alleged discrimination. 4. False Information Anyone who knowingly files a false complaint under this Policy or who knowinglyprovides false information to the OCRSM during an investigation will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action. 5. Written Investigation Report and Findings The OCRSM shall complete a written report of its investigation, including a summaryof the allegations, evidence reviewed and witness statements, findings of material fact and an analysis of those facts, and a conclusion stating whether the Policy was violated, based on the preponderance of evidence standard. The OCRSM then will issue a Notice of Findings and/or provide a copy of the investigation report to the parties and to the appropriate supervisors or department/unit heads, or the Office of Student Conduct, depending on the status of the parties. Copies of the investigation report may be redacted to comply with applicable law. V. APPEAL The Complainant and/or Respondent may appeal the investigation finding within five (5) business days of the date of receipt of the Notice of Findings by submitting to the OCRSM at civilrights@umd.edu a written statement of their intent to appeal and the stated grounds. The scope of the appeal is limited to the grounds set forth below. Mere dissatisfaction with the finding is not a valid basis for appeal. If an appeal is received by the OCRSM, the other party will be notified and given five (5) business days from the date of receipt of that notice to respond by submitting a written statement to the OCRSM at civilrights@umd.edu. All appeals and responses shall include the case name, number, and the party's name and contact information. Appeals filed by more than one party will be considered together in one appeal review process. All appeal documents submitted by a party will be shared with the other party. If neither party submits an appeal, the decision will be considered final five (5) business days after the last date either party received the Notice of Findings. Appeals submitted after five (5) business days shall be denied, except upon a showing of good cause. A. Grounds for Appeal Either party may appeal the Finding only on the following grounds: Report for Senate Document #17- 18-03 45 of 56 570VI-1.00(B) page 61. Substantial Procedural Error Procedural errors or errors in interpretation of University policy were so substantial as to effectively deny a Complainant or Respondent notice or a fair opportunity to b e heard. 2. New Evidence New relevant, material evidence that a reasonably diligent person could not have discovered prior to the issuance of the Notice of Findings has become available. B. Review The appealing party has the burden of proof, and the standard of proof is preponderance of the evidence. Appeals are not intended to allow for a review of the entire investigation, with the exception of new evidence, as referenced above. The appellate review will be based on the written record; parties are not entitled to a hearing or meeting with the reviewing administrator or designee. Appeals will be reviewed in accordance with the Respondent's status as listed below: \u00a7appeals involving a Staff Respondent shall be reviewed by the Vice President for Administration & Finance or designee; \u00a7appeals involving a Faculty Respondent shall be reviewed by the Senior VicePresident and Provost or designee; \u00a7appeals involving a Student Respondent shall be reviewed by the Vice President forStudent Affairs or designee; \u00a7appeals that do not directly involve a faculty, staff, or student Respondent shall bereviewed by the Vice President for Administration & Finance or designee. C.Outcome Upon receipt of the appeal and response, the OCRSM will forward them to the respective Vice President's Office. Within five (5) business days, the Vice President will issue a written determination stating whether the Appeal was granted or denied, including a summary of its rationale (the \"Appeal Outcome\"). The Appeal Outcome shall either: \u00a7affirm the Finding, \u00a7overturn and Reverse Finding, or \u00a7send the Case Back to the Special Investigator with specific directions to reconsider the Finding. The decision of the Vice President or designee as set forth in the Appeal Outcome sha ll be final. The Vice President shall forward a copy of the Appeal Outcome to the OCRSM via email to civilrights@umd.edu. The OCRSM will forward a copy of the Appeal Outcome to the parties and respective supervisor/unit head/department chair or dean/Director of Student Conduct as soon as possible. Report for Senate Document #17- 18-03 46 of 56 571VI-1.00(B) page 7VI. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CORRECTIVE ACTIO N The OCRSM may provide the appropriate Vice President, supervisor, and department chair dean with a Recommendation for Corrective Action. The final decision for determining and implementing any necessary corrective action shall remain the responsibility of the appropriate Vice President or designee. The Vice President or designee will notify the OCRSM within ten (10) business days of any corrective action that has been implemented. The OCRSM is responsible for monitoring efforts to ensure that any ongoing violations of the Policy cease. In the event corrective action requires specific anti-discrimination training not readily available to the parties, the OCRSM will work with the supervisor and/or department/unit head to ensure training occurs as soon as feasible. VII. DISCIPLINARY ACTION A.Students With respect to Student Respondents, the Director of the Office of Student Conduct (OSC) in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Student Conduct is responsible for imposing disciplinary action. 1. Discipline that impacts a student's status with the University includes: expulsion, suspension for a definite or indefinite period, and disciplinary probation for a definite or indefinite period. Expulsion, suspension, and disciplinary probation will be noted on a student's transcript. Disciplinary suspensions and expulsions are subject to the approval of the Vice President for Student Affairs. 2. Discipline that does not impact a student's status with the University includes but is not limited to: educational requirements, \"no contact\" orders, housing restrictions, community service, and disciplinary reprimand. Failure to comply with any of the sanctions listed above may result in further disciplinary action that could impact a student's disciplinary status with the University. The OCRSM may provide other remedies, in consultation with the OSC, as appropriate. These remedies will identify reasonable long-term or permanent remedies to address the effects of the conduct on the Complainant, restore the Complainant's safety and well - being and maximize the Complainant's educational and employment opportunities. Remedies may also be identified to address the effects of the conduct on the University community. Students may appeal discipline imposed as a result of a violation of this Policy in accordance with the Code of Student Conduct. Report for Senate Document #17- 18-03 47 of 56 572VI-1.00(B) page 8B. Staff With respect to Staff Respondents, any disciplinary action or corrective measures will be imposed by the appropriate supervisor and unit head, in consultation with the Assistant Vice President for Human Resources, the Director of the OCRSM, and other relevant administrators, as needed. This may include of removal; and \u00a7termination. Staff may grieve discipline imposed as a result of a violation of this Policy in accordance with their respective grievance rights. C.Faculty With respect to Faculty Respondents, disciplinary action or corrective measures will be imposed by the appropriate supervisor and unit head, in consultation with the Office of the Senior Vice President and Provost, the Director of the OCRSM, and other relevant administrators, as needed. This may include pay; and \u00a7termination. Faculty may grieve discipline imposed as a result of a violation of this Policy in accordance with their respective grievance rights. D.Records Retention The OCRSM will maintain the records relating to the investigation. The respective unit responsible for issuing any discipline will maintain any disciplinary records in accordance with the University's records retention schedule. The respective unit shall also provide a copy of the disciplinary records to the OCRSM. Report for Senate Document #17- 18-03 48 of 56 573VI-1.00(B) page 9VIII. EXTERNAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES THAT ADDRESS DISCRIMINATION COMPLAINTS Filing an employment discrimination complaint under this Policy or an alternative campus procedure does not preclude an employee from filing a complaint with the Maryland Commission on Civil Rights, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or the Office for Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education. Complainants who wish to file discrimination complaints that are not connected with the official functions of the University or not falling within the scope of this Policy, will be referred to appropriate University, County, State, or Federal agencies by the OCRSM. Office for Civil Rights U.S. Department of Education Philadelphia Office (Regional Office for Maryland) The Wanamaker Building 100 Penn Square East, Suite 515 Website: https://egov.eeoc.gov/eas/ It is important to note that in order to protect certain legal rights and remedies, Complainants must comply with certain time limits and deadlines. Affected persons should contact the relevant agencies listed above to verify time limits for filing. Failure to meet required deadlines may result in a loss of rights to seek a legal remedy. Replacement for: Policy VI-1.00(B) University of Maryland Code on Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Report for Senate Document #17- 18-03 49 of 56 574Appendix 3 - Peer Institution Overview The Task Force reviewed Big 10 and other peer institution data and best practices on diversity - related initiatives on prevention & education, campus climate, hate/bias response, and free/hate speech. An overview of the Task Force's findings and highlights from several institutions are provided below and should be consider ed while developing the University's comprehensive diversity and inclusion initiative. Prevention & Education Through its review, the Task Force identified best practices related to diversity and inclusion. Much of the focus of diversity -related program ming is on initiatives for students. Several institutions focus programming on incoming and transfer students through a blend of required and optional activities that can be offered through online modules or in -person workshops. Some institutions provide t raining for faculty on difficult dialogues in the classroom. Institutions varied in the types of content areas provided in programming, such as implicit bias and bystander intervention. Some institutions also provided badging/certificate programs that reco gnize core competencies and skills. Peers also provided cultural competency education through a variety of co -curricular activities or through specific courses. There were also some institutions that provided a comprehensive diversity website that includes resources, upcoming events, resources on communities and affinity groups, programs, trainings, awards & scholarships, etc. Programming examples from peer institutions are highlighted below. Programming for Incoming & Transfer Students Michigan State University requires that all incoming undergraduates and transfer students complete an 30 -45 minute online \" Diversity & Inclusion@MSU eLearning \" program, which gives a gener al overview of diversity and inclusion at MSU, an introduction to basic terms and concepts, and a sense of how students can engage with each other more deeply at MSU. The University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign requires all first year students to attend IConnect , an innovative workshop that explores some of the foundational skills needed to collaborate, learn, and work in diverse environments during a student' s years at Illinois and beyond. The University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign requires first -year students to take DiversityEDU30 , an online training module used to provide a common understanding of diversity terminology, introduce diversity concepts students will face during their time at the University of Illinois, and challenge students to embrace the opportunity to engage with difference as part of their Illinois experience. The University of Iowa provides students with an opportunity to attend a 45-minute welcome and information session presented by the Center for Diversity and Enrichment during Orientation. This session is required for Advantage Iowa Scholars (historically underrepresented minorities) and students receiving military benefits. Workshops on Difficult Dialogues in the Classroom Michiga n State University offers resources for Difficult Dialogues in the Classroom . The University of Minnesota offers workshops and trainings, which inc ludes a session on Teaching with Intention: Facilitating Challenging Conversations in the Classroom . 575Implicit Bias Programs Michigan State University offers an Understanding Implicit Bias Certification Program , a series of three courses that will allow participants to experience thoroughly examined implicit bias and begin the work of interrupting their own biases as well as those embedded within systems at MSU. Bystander Intervention Programs Northwestern University offers bystander intervention traini ng to students, faculty, and staff. Step Up is a bystander intervention training program that aims to create a more engaged Northwestern community by providing students, faculty, and staff with the basic tools to safely and effectively intervene in situati ons where someone might be in danger. Step Up includes a topic on discrimination. Cultural Competency Education Northwestern University offers a variety of dialogue programs, leadership programs, and other training opportunities to include Cultural Competency Education . The University of Wisconsin offers a course to students called Student SEED , a non - traditional, grass -roots developed social justice course which uses \"the textbook of students lives\" as the main teaching tool. Students explore and share their own individual experiences with race, class, gender, sexual ori entation, religion, and ability in order to learn about and understand the large systems of privilege and oppression. The course facilitators strive to create a safe and respectful environment for students to reflect on an share their own experiences, lear n from their peers' experiences and build community while engaging in deep critical thinking around issues that are pervasive in our society and daily lives. Badging/Certification Programs The University of Iowa has created a badging type of system called Building University of Iowa Leadership for Diversity (BUILD) . The BUILD initiative is an opportunity for UI faculty and staff to gain strategic knowledge and skills to contribute to a welcoming and inclusive environment for all. By completing a series of workshops, participants will earn a certificate demonstrating their commitment as leaders for diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace and classroom. Purdue University offers a badging program that is called DiversiKey . The DiversiKey Certificate Program is a competencies -based program of curricular, co -curricular, and field experiences i n diversity and leadership. Core competencies, skills, and cognition areas are organized into three clusters, personal growth, interpersonal development, and community involvement . The use of these competency clusters offers skills based progression to gui de development and assess achievement. The University of Minnesota offers an Equity and Diversity Certificate program that helps participants develop the tools necessary for advan cing equity and diversity in all aspects of their personal and professional lives. It's free of charge and open to students, faculty, staff, and alumni on all campuses of the University of Minnesota. Comprehensive Diversity Website \"Diversity at Iowa \" is an example of a comprehensive website that includes resources, upcoming events, communities and affinity groups, programs, trainings, awards & scholarships, etc. 576Campus Climate Climate Surveys Nearly all peer institutions reviewed engage in efforts to survey the campus climate for diversity and inclusion purposes, or are beginning to develop such efforts. Campus climate is typically measured on an annual or biennial basis through the online dist ribution of surveys to the entire campus community. Half of the institutions use surveys that they developed, while a couple institutions use outside vendors to develop or provide survey instruments. Some institutions utilize the SERU survey, which is a su rvey focused on academic and civic engagement that originated at University of California -Berkeley and has been made available to institutions in the Association of American Universities (AAU). In most cases, the results of the survey are analyzed by the office responsible for institutional diversity initiatives and/or the Office of the Provost, and results are used to create new initiatives. Some institutions share the results with the campus community, and a few have made results public. As most institu tions are still in the beginning stages of surveying campus climate, most are still developing their plans for how to utilize the information collected. Principles & Values A few peer institutions have engaged in efforts to clearly articulate the principl es and values that define the University and its community. Institutions with statements of core values include Penn State University, The Ohio State University, University of Illinois at Urbana -Champaign, and Michigan State University. Of these institutio ns, Penn State has gone the furthest in developing tools and strategies for continually articulating and emphasizing the values of its community. Each value identified in the statement has an associated video that helps explain what that value means to Pen n State. Penn State has developed tools such as tips for including values statements in syllabi, conversation starters focused on the values, and media materials such as posters that are available to faculty and staff. All materials related to Penn State's values can be found online at https://universityethics.psu.edu/penn -state -values . Hate/Bias Response Reporting an Incident All institutions surveyed are committed to creating a safe, equitable, and inclusive environment for students, staff, and faculty, one that is free from discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. Every institution has a slightly different approach to reporting, investigating, and resolving conflicts of hate and bias. Most universities have units or teams dedicated to handle incidents of hate and bias, such as the Campus Inclusion Team (University of Iowa), Inclusion and Anti -Bias Unit (MSU), and Bias Response and Referral Network (University of Minnesota). In gen eral, every institution relies on its analogs to the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, Human Resources, Office of the Dean of Students, and the Police Department to partner with other necessary units to respond to hate/bias incidents. To report hate/bias incidents, faculty and staff are generally asked to contact Human Resources or resolve their conflicts internally with their supervisors. Students are typically encouraged to report either directly or indirectly to the Office of the Dean of Students, the Office of the Provost, or another academic or student -focused unit. Reporting an incident may be done via email, phone call, online, or face to face. Almost all universities prefer online reporting. One peer institution prefers reporting via email or phon e call in order to respond promptly. 577 Institutions vary on whether they accept anonymous reports. Some do not accept anonymous incident reports, while other institutions may accept the report and proceed with an investigation as long as sufficient informat ion is provided. Many institutions encourage reporting an incident even if the victim does not wish to move forward with a formal investigation, in order to allow the institution to be aware of the situation, and to take steps to ensure the safety of the v ictim and others in the community. Reporting also allows the institution to keep accurate records of the number of incidents, assess incident reports to identify patterns, and alert the campus community of potential danger when incidents or patterns are on going. Initial Response to a Report Upon receiving the incident report, those impacted by or perceived to be targets of the incident are typically contacted within 48 hours. Based upon the severity of the incident, almost all institutions take steps to provide support to those affected as n ecessary. Support measures may include, but are not limited to: referrals for medical attention or psychological support, connecting the individual with other impacted community members, academic or workplace accommodations (extension for an exam or assign ment, excused time off from class or work), transportation assistance, housing accommodations, or providing appropriate support through University Police if there is a continuing threat. Policy Structure and Adjudication Procedures All of the institutions surveyed prohibit discrimination, harassment, and threats in some way, many through non -discrimination or equal opportunity policies. Some institutions provide definitions of hate/bias incidents online and in informal guidance, but none provide such definitions in policy documents. \"The related conduct that is classified as a bias incident is defined as an act of conduct, speech, or expression to which a bias motive is evident as a contributing factor (regardless of whether the act is criminal). A hate crime is a bias incident that has risen to the level of a crime. ...All hate crimes are bias incidents, but not all bias incidents are hate crimes.\" (See p. 9-10: http://www.northwestern.edu/up/docs/NorthwesternUniversityCampusViolencePreventionPlan. pdf) \"An event that has the effect of demeaning or degrading an individual or a group and is motivated in whole or in part by the p erpetrator's bias against a particular group. Experiencing prejudice, stigma, or discriminatory attitudes and/or behavior.\" (See: https://bias.unl.edu/bias - faqs-terminology ) In cases where hate /bias incidents violate University policies on discrimination, harassment, and threats and a perpetrator is able to be identified, the institution will pursue action. For these types of conduct, half of our peer institutions have a single policy that appli es to all members of the university community (students, faculty, and staff); the other half of our peers have separate policies for separate constituencies. Seven institutions have policies that allow for adjudication of complaints regarding discriminati on, harassment, or threats by a committee. At most institutions where adjudication by committee is not the norm, it is possible to adjudicate by committee in certain cases (such as for students but not for faculty, or for especially complex cases). At inst itutions where cases are not adjudicated by committee, the responsible unit is often the Office of Student Affairs (if the respondent is a student) or the unit through which the respondent is employed (if faculty or staff). 578After adjudication, the respons ible unit typically enacts the sanctions, if any. Sanctions for students typically range from required diversity training, loss of privileges (such as library access or on -campus housing), do -not-contact orders, suspension, and separation from the institut ion. Possible sanctions for faculty and staff can range from a letter of reprimand, recommended counseling, suspension or leave of absence without pay, reassignment of teaching or other responsibilities, probation, demotion, or termination. University R esponse to Non -Conduct Incidents Hate/bias incidents are often disruptive, but they may not always be in violation of University policy or the law. In many cases, hate/bias incidents that will not result in discipline still warrant a response from the Univ ersity, in terms of opportunities for discussion or education on how the incident affected members of the University community. Possible options for resolution may include one of the following actions, as suggested by Rutgers University: Initiating contact with any group(s) affected by the hate/bias incident (e.g., a residence hall, a student organization, recreation center, class, etc.) Ensuring that any offending material, such as graffiti or defaced posters, have been removed. Note: materials should be removed only after police have been contacted and have come to the scene to take a report. Making contact with persons identified or persons suspected of committing the hate/bias incident to talk about the incident and the impact on the community. Recommen dation of an educational program or initiative to alleviate the impact on the community from the hate/bias incident. Communicating with Students, Faculty, and Staff Regarding Hate/Bias Incidents In the immediate aftermath of a hate/bias incident, or duri ng ongoing incidents, institutions will typically alert the campus community of any serious or continuing threats on or near campus, to provide the community with enough time and information to take safety precautions. In the aftermath of hate/bias incide nts, very few universities provide information about hate and bias incidents openly unless there is a continuing threat. At some institutions, the only acknowledgement of statistics related to hate/bias incidents appear in the Annual Security Report requir ed by the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act). Some institutions do prepare detailed reports and provide data on hate/bias incidents and hate crimes to their campus community on an annual or more frequen t basis. The University of Illinois at Urbana -Champaign bias assessment website http://bart.illinois.edu/ aggregates information about the institution's policies and procedures, as well as reporting information . Illinois's approach is comprehensive, in that it provides a form for reporting bias incidents and two types of reports - an annual report with description of hate/bias incidents and associated follow -up, and a statistical breakdown of incidents. The University of Wisconsin also has a comprehensive bias reporting website at https://doso.students.wisc.edu/services/bias -reporting -process/ . The website includes an online incident report form, resources for those affected by hate/bias incidents, data on current incidents, and data on incidents from past semesters. Incident data includes information on the type of incident, the targeted identity, and the action taken. The Ohio State University includes records of bias reports received by the Bias Assessment and Response Team on its website and provides summary reports from each academic year. https://studentlife.osu.edu/bias/policies -and-reports.aspx The University of Michigan provides information about hate crimes and bias -related incidents at https://deanofstudents .umich.edu/bias -incident -report -log 579 The University of Iowa collects data on the types of concerns that are raised in each incident reported on campus and shares this information with the campus community (https://dos.uiowa.edu/assistance/annual -reports/ ). Rutgers University, Penn State University collect information for each incident and the final report is preserved in a private online database. Free/Hate Speech Policies Related to Fre e and Hate Speech None of the institutions surveyed specifically ban hate speech, although some institutions have created restrictions on speech based on the time, place, and manner of the speech. Many institutions designate specific areas on campus where free speech, demonstrations, may be held, either spontaneously or with prior approval. Some have separate regulations or processes for members of the campus community and those from outside groups who wish to speak or demonstrate on campus. Many institutio ns include language in policies or guidelines that indicates that those exercising their free speech rights are not to violate established University policies and procedures or interfere with campus operations. Most institutions make a distinction between free expression or free speech and conduct that is actionable in some way. For instance, while free speech rights are protected, they do not protect an individual's right to threaten another individual in a way that suggests they may be subject to imminen t harm. Nearly all institutions have policies or executive -level statements on protecting freedom of expression; academic freedom is often linked to freedom of expression in these policies and statements. Purdue University's Statement of Commitment to Fr eedom of Expression includes the following: \"The University's fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation may not be suppressed because the ideas put forth are thought by some or even by most members of the University community t o be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong - headed... It is for the individual members of the University community, not for the University as an institution, to make those judgments for themselves, and to act on those judgments not by seeking to suppress speec h, but by openly and vigorously contesting the ideas that they oppose. Indeed, fostering the ability of members of the University community to engage in such debate and deliberation in an effective and responsible manner is an essential part of the Univers ity's educational University's President's Statement on Free Speech Rights and Responsibilities states the following: \"The basic purposes of the University are the advancement, dissemination, and application of knowledge. The most basic condition for the achievement of these purposes is freedom of expression and communication. Without this freedom, eff ective sifting and testing of ideas cease, and research, teaching, and learning are stifled...The robust exchange of ideas and perspectives can be indicative of a healthy intellectual environment. However, actions which directly or indirectly inhibit the f reedoms and rights enjoyed by others are anathema to maintenance of a collegial environment.\" (see: https://cabs.msu.edu/news/key -issues/issue -docs/free -speech.html ) Policies on Demonstrations/Protests and Use of Campus Facilities All institutions have policies and procedures that guide the use of facilities and spaces on campus for assembly, discussion, or protest: 580 Ten have restrictions on who may reserve indoor or ou tdoor space; these restrictions range from pre -approval to gaining sponsorship from a campus club/organization. Nine institutions restrict the ability of outside groups to initiate or host protests/demonstrations on campus. The restrictions range from goin g through pre -approval processes for the event to finding an on -campus sponsor and providing proof of insurance. Eleven of the institutions have a content -neutral policy; they do not specify restrictions for the content of protests, demonstrations, or outd oor activities. When restrictions are specified, as in the case of Indiana University, they are generally related to providing equal opportunities for political candidates running for office to hold campaign events on campus. Eight institutions have design ated outdoor areas for free assembly by University or non - University groups. In addition, nearly all of our peer institutions provide guidance on protest activities that prevent normal operations from taking place. Five of these institutions provide guidance on counter -protests or appropriate/inappropriate ways to protest controversial speakers. Four institutions provide guidance on University police support for student groups who wish to protest; two do not specify this in policy; and seven do not ha ve any guidance on University police support for student groups who wish to protest. Policies on Leaflets and Posters Nearly all of our peer institutions require pre -approval of materials for hanging posters on campus; nine of them provide content -neutral rules and four do not. When leaflets and other materials are distributed on campus, four universities require prior approval, two do not require prior -approval, and seven institutions do not specify any guidelines. Policies on Chalking Nearly all inst itutions have policies/procedures on chalking or otherwise writing messages on campus surfaces. Seven institutions do not have a procedure for removing messages based on content; three did not indicate whether they do or do not have such a procedure. Three institutions have a procedure for removing messages based on content. Aside from regular chalking, some institutions specifically state that waterproof and spray chalk are prohibited. The extent to which these policies regulate chalking and writing messa ges on campus surfaces range from complete prohibition to allowing chalking on specific areas. 581Possible outcomesBISS Reporting Protocol Share information: Daily website updates showing incident numbers & trends Bi-weekly response team meetings & monthly student advisory group meetings Other reporting options: UMPD (criminal activity) 301-405-3555 or #3333 (from most cell phones) Office of Student Conduct (student policy violation) studentconduct@umd.edu go.umd.edu/oscreport Office of Civil Rights and Sexual Misconduct civilrights@umd.edu Confidential campus resources: Counseling Center 301-314-7651 CARE to Stop Violence 301-741-3442 uhc-care@umd.edu BIAS INCIDENT SUPP SERVIC ESBias incident BISS will... resolution 1-on-1 ongoing supportRefer (as needed) *Note: BISS is not a sanctioning body and does not determine or implement consequencesSupport: Intake conversation(s) centering impacted person & exploring options Outreach to support others impacted Ongoing support & check-ins Engage person impacting others Engage leaders to address systemic issues 582 UNIVERSIT Y OF MARYLAND CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE 583Spring 2021 Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Report Guidance DUE: Monday, April 12, 2021 Institution: University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) Date Submitted: April 12, 2021 Point(s) of Contact (names and email Larry Sanford ( lsanford@umces.edu ), Amy Griffin ( agriffin@umces.edu ) 1. A description of how the institution defines diversity (no more than one page); how did the institution develop that definition (e.g., processes, sources, and guidance used)? Traditionally, the geosciences have t railed other sciences for true representation and diversity, with a 2018 report published in Nature revealing that there has been little to no progress in diversity efforts in higher education for the earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences . As such, this is an area where UMCES has struggled. We recognize that having diverse voices and perspectives is imp ortant in both research and campus culture, as diversity leads to innovation and more comprehensive research. UMCES is committed to being in the vanguard of efforts to make geosciences more diverse, equitable, and inclusive. Our commitment will involve con scious actions to attract, recruit, and retain faculty, students, and staff from underrepresented minorities as well as creating an institutional environment where we can all thrive. While diversity efforts at UMCES have been ongoing, but sporadic, over th e past few years, UMCES' first discussions as an institution of how our institution defines diversity occurred in June 2020 at the first meeting of our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Collaborative (DEIC). For UMCES, not only is diversity important, but a s an environmental institution, environmental justice is also an important element. When discussing the title of the new Collaborative, faculty, staff, and students jointly identified three areas of focus for the group: Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and noted how these are all separate, but intertwined issues that need addressing. The group drafted shared definitions of these terms: Diversity means the range of human differences, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, socioeconomic status, physical ability or attributes, religious or ethical values systems, national origin, political beliefs, a nd cultures. Diversity means more than just acknowledging and/or tolerating difference. It's a set of conscious practices that seek to understand, appreciate and value the interdependence of humanity, cultures, and the natural environment. Equity means ensuring that everyone has support and access to the resources needed to be successful and identifying and eliminating barriers that have prevented the full participation of communities most impacted by systemic exclusion . This involves increasing justice an d fairness within the procedures and processes of institutions and systems, as well as in the distribution of resources. Tackling equity issues requires an understanding of the root causes of outcome disparities within our society and institution . Inclusion means ensuring that people of all backgrounds, identities, abilities, perspectives, and beliefs have an equal opportunity to belong, achieve, and contribute to their communities. An inclusive institution promotes and sustains a sense of belonging; it val ues and practices respect where all people are recognized for their inherent worth and dignity, talents, beliefs, backgrounds, and ways of living. 584UMCES also feels it is important to note that our shared understanding of these definitions will likely change as we evolve as an institution. 2. A brief (no more than one page) highlight of the most successful ongoing and new institutional initiatives designed to address issues related to cultural diversity within the campus and the broader community, and how their efficacy is measured; UMCES has participated in a variety of ongoing institutional initiatives de signed to address issues related to cultural diversity: PROMISE AGEP: UMCES has actively participated in the Summer Success Institute over the last few years. NOAA Living Marine Resources Cooperative Science Center (LMRCSC): IMET, our Baltimore campus, supports 3 -4 graduate fellows per year, for up to three years each, using funds from the NOAA -supported LMRCSC. The LMRCSC aims to train the next generation of marine scientists from underrepresented communities. Current LMRCSC graduate fellows are working with mentors at IMET and CBL. IMET Undergraduate Summer Internship: Annually, IMET hosts a nine -week summer internship program for students from backgrounds that are underrepresented in the marine sciences. The program includes laboratory work and a variety of science seminars. Maryland Sea Grant Research Experience for Undergrads (REU): The REU Program has intentionally diversified over the last few years, pullin g in more students from backgrounds underrepresented in the marine sciences. Of note, LatinX students have been increasingly represented and as have other students of color. Additionally, women now represent the majority of REU interns . UMCES has also tak en on a variety of new institutional initiatives related to cultural diversity within our campus: Establishment of a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Collaborative (DEIC) in June 2020. The DEIC meets monthly as a group and occasionally opens meetings to th e entire UMCES community. The group is a forum of practice, engaging faculty, staff, and students to tackle and discuss initiatives related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. This group has enabled UMCES to centralize and better track DEI efforts across our geographically dispersed units. The UMCES Graduate Student Council has spearheaded a variety of initiatives, including the drafting of an UMCES Code of Conduct (see below), the facilitation of a variety of diversity seminars, and actively participating in the DEIC. An array of groups around our campuses have been created or have refocused their efforts around DEI initiatives. These include a chapter of the American Association of University Women, a chapter of the Society for Women in Marine Science, a variety of localized URGE (Unlearning Racism in the Geosciences) pods, as well as local laboratory DEI groups. UMCES Code of Conduct: In conjunction with the GSC, the UMCES DEIC has drafted a comprehensive Code of Conduct, to be adopted by the Executive Co uncil for the University for use at all of our campuses. We hope it helps foster an atmosphere of mutual respect and cooperation to encourage the free and open exchange of ideas. Campus Climate Survey: UMCES is actively working with two outside organizati ons to conduct a comprehensive campus climate survey. We hope to utilize this dat a to make recommendations for improvement, including potential future trainings. 585For our broad, more recent initiatives, we recognize the need to track the efficacy of the group efforts. We plan to bi ennially assess these changes through a qualitative survey and adjust as necessary. Our HR Department also keeps track of employment numb ers related to diversity, thus allowing for a more quantitative look at our progress. 3. A brief (no more than one page) discussion of the ways in which the institution anticipates COVID - 19 most affecting - either negatively or positively - efforts to enhance diversity on campus. This may include, for example, acknowledgement of issues such as disproportionate impacts on retention and graduation among certain populations; the shift to distance education modalities limiting the ability to provide in person pro gramming; or, in contrast, the shift to online education providing opportunity for more students to access diversity programming. Due to our distributed nature, UMCES courses were taught online prior to the COVID -19 pandemic, so the transition to all -online synchronous teaching was relatively seamless for UMCES. COVID- 19 Downsides: Efforts to implement some diversity initiatives a nd their assessment procedures from our official submitted diversity plan have been slowed due to COVID -19. Recent cuts in state budgets have limited our ability to move forward with some initiatives that involve substantial financial commitments. Addition ally, COVID-related meetings have increased over the past year, pulling time away from other important diversity efforts. Due to visa restrictions, some international students have been unable to physically participate at our campuses. We have engaged with them through online learning and have utilized UMD fellowships to support their tuition costs . COVID- 19 Upsides: As many of us have moved to remote tele -work environments, this has increased access and meeting attendance/involvement for a variety of topics, including diversity. UMCES also made support available to students who needed computer, internet resources, or other technology resources while working from home. UMCES also had some financial support for students via CARES Act funding; we provided thi s to our students on an as -needed basis. 4. See attached appendix. 586 APPALACHIAN LABORATORY CHESAPEAKE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY HORN POINT LABORATORY INSTITUTE OF MARINE AND ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY MARYLAND SEA GRANT COLLEGE AN INSTITUTION OF THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM OF MARYLAND University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Cultural Diversity Programs and Planning 2020- 2021 Introduction The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) operates under specific statutory mandates and a revised Mission Statement approved by the University System of Maryland (USM) Board of Regents and the Maryland Higher Education Commission in early 2012. Its statutory mandate is to \"conduct a comprehensive program to develop and apply a predictive ecology for Maryland to the improvement and preservation of the physical environment through a program of research, public service, and education.\" This revised mission included a path for accreditation to award joint degrees with other USM partners and to assume an expanded role in graduate and professional education. UMCES completed its accreditation review by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and was awarded accreditation in March 2016. Through collaborations with other USM institutions, including the Maryland Sea Grant College that it administers, UMCES leads, coordinates, and catalyzes environmental research and education wi thin the USM. The 2019 UMCES Strategic Initiatives Plan, Environmental Intelligence for Resilient Environments and Communities, defines UMCES' commitment to cultural diversity and future goals and plans. The Strategic Plan emphasizes our commitment to engage students from groups underrepresented in the environmental sciences as well as training and inspiring the nation's next generation of environmental scientists. The Strategic directions defined in the plan regarding cultural diversity include the fo llowing statement: UMCES will be an exemplar of environmental science professionals reflecting the face of the communities served by its work. Knowledge discovery accelerates and the societal relevance of scientific research improves when supported by a diverse workforce. Building this culture requires new commitments. We will enhance diversity of interns, graduate students, faculty, and staff. We will cultivate inclusivity through professional development and innovative mentoring. We will incentivize change via individual and institutional performance metrics.

Outreach and training will continue throughout the next year, and periodic campus climate surveys will help to assess and monitor our progress in this area. 590 UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE 591 University of Maryland Eastern Shore April 2021 1 | Page DIVISION of ACADEMIC AFFAIRS Office of the Provost and Vice President Spring 2021 Institutional Programs of Cultural Diversity Report Guidance DUE: Monday, April 12, 2021 Institution: University of Maryland Eastern Shore Date Submitted: April 12, 20 21 Point(s) of Contact (names and email addresses): Nancy Niemi, Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs ( nsniemi@umes.edu) Latoya Jenkins Interim Vice President for Enrollment Management and Student E xperience (ljenkins@umes.edu ) Jason Casares Director, Office of Institutional Equity/ Campus Compliance Officer (jacasares @umes.edu ) 1. A description of how the institution defines diversity (no more than one page); how did the institution develop that definition (e.g., processes, sources, and guidance used)? The University of Maryland Eastern Shore 's (UMES') definition of diversity is broad -based, emphasizing the identities and experiences of groups that have been historically under -represented in higher education, and encompassing age, class, culture, (dis)ability, ethnicity, gender identity, gender expression, immigration status, national origin, race, religion and spirituality, sex and sexual identity, veteran status, among others. We affirm that diverse experiences and perspectives in the classroom and across campus enhance everyone's educational experience. Further, UMES considers diversity as essential to our academic mission, purpose and viability. Fully embracing the concept of diversity is necessary for achieving a vibrant, inclusive community that reflects the world beyond the Eastern Shore, challenges and encourages us to broaden our perspectives and worldviews and helps to fully prepare students to make valuable contributions as citizens of a diverse and globally integrated society. Our efforts broaden and deepen our personal and intellectual understanding, preparing all of us - students, staff, and faculty - to make thoughtful, responsible contributions as individuals, community members, and professionals in a diverse and globally integrated world. The University developed this definition of diversity as universit y members worked in accordance with Senate Bill 438 and House Bill 905, identical bills entitled \"Institutions of Higher Education - Plans for Program of Cultural Div ersity\" in 2008. With the initiation of the plans for an institution -wide cultural diversi ty program, UMES' then -diversity task force created this definition , surveying all constituent groups on campus, using a variety of means (polls, small -group discussions, listening sessions) to engage its stakeholders' views on the meaning of diversity, bo th at UMES and in its external communities. 592 University of Maryland Eastern Shore April 2021 2 | Page At that same time, the diversity task force created a Diversity Vision Statement , which reads as follows: Diversity is one of the UMES core values. In developing and nurturing a diverse and inclusive community, we respect and engage across difference. We face and respond thoughtfully and responsibly to difficult questions. We build bridges and establish relationships. Individually and as a community, we critically examine and challenge our biases, assumptions, institutional structures and worldviews. We understand and seek to mitigate inequities through meaningful diversity experiences. Finally, UMES' understanding of diversity is embedded in who we and who we will be: we are driven to honor our past by buildin g our future as an institution at which all students achieve beyond their potential, and where all faculty and staff know and act to realize this goal. This is only possible if our campus culture is genuinely inclusive of each person's role in such an ach ievement, and perhaps more importantly, if everyone believes that our students, largely first -generation and under -represented minorities, are equal to any other in contributing to scientific research and discovery. This continues to be our overriding goal and challenge, and it is reaffirmed in our institutional development, through our faculty, students, and staff. 2. Highlight of the most successful ongoing and new institutional initiatives designed to address issues related to cultural diversity within the campus and the broader community, and how their efficacy is measured The following are UMES' most successful new and ongoing institutional initiatives, designed to address issues related to cultural diversity: Men of Color in Education (ongoing): Educa tion program started in early 2020, focusing on the development of Black male teachers in K -12 Education. Through three components: the Man the Shore Network, the University Cohort, and the High School Teacher University, this program is committed to usi ng UMES as a powerful vehicle for increasing cultural diversity in the Delmarva and greater Maryland teaching labor force. Efficacy is measured by student participation numbers, completers, and by community school engagement numbers. MADE -- Preparing, Enc ouraging & Inspiring Our Future Leaders For Success (ongoing): The mission of UMES MADE is to empower, inspire, and encourage the personal maturation and intellectual development of our campus men. UMES MADE provides an array of activities and workshops ai med at promoting and providing access to achievement in the areas of social responsibility, academics, and professional development. UMES MADE's holistic goal is to bring voice to vision by encouraging a philosophical and cultural shift within the mental f ramework of UMES's male students in order to assist them in the attainment of success in life through selfless service, acuity, and integrity. Efficacy is measured by number of participants, longevity of program, and the actions in which participants engag e. New American Democracy Project -- Collaboratory (new): UMES' efforts toward civic engagement strive to make a difference in the lives of our students and community by supporting the development of knowledge, skills, values, and motivation. Our mission is to promote a culture of civic engagement by implementing service learning as a component of the academic experience and expanding our current program of university outreach initiatives. To that end, we applied for and were accepted for participation in the Understanding Engagement in Times of Crisis partnership with the New American Democracy Project and Collaboratory. UMES is committed to empowering the immediate and surrounding campus community through creating political awareness and influencing positive change through communal and campus civic 593 University of Maryland Eastern Shore April 2021 3 | Page engagement. By joining \"Understanding Engagement in Times of Crisis,\" we are establish ing and build ing an infrastructure that highlights our engagement and documents our diverse initiatives across campus. Currently our campus offers a variety of ways for students, staff, and faculty to engage with our local and global communities, but we lack a central organizing body to keep track of the myriad events, promotions, initiatives, and outreach strategies. Like wise, we lack a data -collection body to track how many members of our campus community participate or how far -reaching our effects may be in the broader community. By establishing this organizational body, are creating new campus -community partnerships and expand the reach of our existing ones. We hope to integrate these initiatives into our campus identity in a permanent way and enfold academic opportunities into them. We hope, finally, to prepare our campus to apply for Carnegie's Community Engagement Classification to help ensure our work is continued well into the next decade and beyond. In short, by broadening UMES' participation and expanding our visibility on the Eastern Shore and beyond, we hope to increase the kinds of opportunities that will empower students, faculty, staff, and our community to address social issues, share resources, and drive cultural discourse that eradicates oppressive practices, economic inequities, and social injustices. 3. Discuss the ways in which the institution antic ipates COVID -19 most affecting - either negatively or positively - efforts to enhance diversity on campus. This may include, for example, acknowledgement of issues such as disproportionate impacts on retention and graduation among certain populations; the shift to distance education modalities limiting the ability to provide in -person programming; or, in contrast, the shif t to online education providing opportunity for more students to access diversity programming. UMES is already experiencing the effects of COVID -19 on its efforts to enhance diversity on our campus. Our efforts, for example, to increase our transfer student numbers have been severely interrupted because of our lack of in-person visits to community college partners, and to our Wes tern Shore sites. Further, fewer students are enrolling in our community college partners' programs, which has slowed the pipeline of our potential transfer student population for the upcoming year. Undergraduate graduation and retention effects are already being felt, although the real impacts will not be seen until after the end of AY2020 -21. The majority of our student population is high need even in a non -COVID year; with the ripple effects of the pandemic on our student population's families, we have had ma ny more students postpone enrollment for a semester or a year in order to be home with their families and support them if they can. We do not yet know if they will return to school and when they might do so. Equally as importantly, while our student popu lation largely had access to a computer, many of them did not have adequate - or any - access to adequate broadband, which made remote education extremely complicated, if not impossible. Many students tried (and are still trying) to study using their phone s as learning devices, with less -than -effective results. Our student population largely desires, and thrives in, a face- to-face, high -support learning environment; even with our faculty and staff providing extraordinary support (which they have), our alre ady- diverse student population is suffering and, as a whole, is disproportionally affected by the COVID -19 pandemic. 594 Revised: April 2021 1 2021- 2025 DIVERSITY PLAN UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND EASTERN SHORE 595 Revised: April 2021 2 2021 Update to the UMES Cultural Diversity Plan I. Implementation strategy and a timeline for meeting goals within the plan; We are still in the process of assigning e ach core principle/goal (listed below) the measurable outcomes to effectively tell a data driven story about cultural diversity at UMES. The mechanisms for measurement are embedded in the goals, which begin on page five, but the specific numerical goals ha ve not been established (COVID delayed.) The institution has create d a committee composed of various professionals to assist with implementing the goals, including creating the specific strategies and monitoring them . Committee composition include s Instit utional Equity and Compliance, Academic Affairs, Enrollment Management and Student Experience, and Human Resources. II. A description of the way the institution addresses cultural diversity among its student, faculty, and staff populations; COVID -19 limited the University ability to host too many in -person events with faculty, staff, and/or students. Cultural awareness events were held with small groups of 5 -10 students in -person and/or online during various cultural celebrations including but not lim ited to Hispanic Heritage Month, Coming Out Day, Women's History Month, etc. The University has contracted with SafeColleges to develop, create, and generate learning content/training for faculty, staff, and students. Training modules focus on various are as of protected class including race, ethnicity, ADA, civil rights, etc . will be shared in the fall 2021 for the campus community. Frequent research briefs regarding cultural diversity shared with faculty, via Academic Affairs Frequent academic programming by departments, addressing cultural diversity within their disciplines (specific plans for each School are being developed). III. A description of how the institution plans to enhance cultural diversity (if improvement is needed); Actualization of the diversity council that will meet monthly to review, manage, and centralize diversity/inclusion efforts for the campus and through the Diversity Strategic Plan. Promotion of training and education through online tools and increased in -person educational sessions. Development of an intentional plan regarding recruitment, hiring, and retention of diverse staff/faculty. Development of an intentional plan regarding recruitment strategy to increase efforts for a diverse student body. Development of intentio nally planned budget dollars to support an inclusive and accessible campus community. Development of diversity/inclusion goal in the University's strategic plan. . 596 Revised: April 2021 3 IV. Process for reporting campus -based hate crimes The University of Maryland Eastern Shore p rovides a number of options to report crimes and serious incidents and emergencies, to include hate crimes. All students, faculty, staff, and visitors are encouraged to make prompt and accurate reports to the University Police if they are a victim or witness a crime. It is critical for the safety of the community that you report all crimes and other incidents immediately so that the University Police can respond and investigate the situation as soon as possible to determine if a timely warning or emergency notification to the community or a portion thereof, is required. Reporting Crimes to the University Police We strongly encourage all members of the University community to report all crimes and other emergencies to the UMES Police in a timely manner. Police Officers are on duty 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. To contact the University Police in an emergency situation dial (410) 651 -3300 from a public phone, Ext. 3300 from a University phone, or dial 9-1- 1. University extension phones are situated at various locations in academic buildings and in the residence halls throughout the campus. You may also use the \"blue light\" emergency phones which are placed at various strategic locations on the campus grounds. Non-emergency calls to the University Police should utilize (410) 651 -6590. The \"Tip line\" telephone number to report information anonymously is 410-651-8484. The TDD (Telecommunications Device for the Deaf) telephone number is 410-621-2552. If the crime occurred off campus, University Police will direct you to the appropriate law enforcement agency. Crimes occurring at the Arden's Run apartments or the Talons apartments, both public -private housing partnerships located on UMES Boulevard, should be reported to the Princess Anne Police Department at (410) 651- 1822. For emergencies you should call 9 -1-1. For crimes occurring within the boundaries of Somerset County contact the Somerset County Sheriff's Department at (410) 651 -9225 or the Maryland State Police, Princess Anne Barrack, at (410) 651 -3101. All reports may be made in per son at the Police Department, which is located at the Department of Public Safety, 30737 University Blvd South, Princess Anne, MD. 21853 (Across from Waters Hall). Although there are many resources available, University Police should be notified of any crime, whether or not an investigation continues, to assure the University can address any and all security concerns and inform the community if there is a significant threat. V. A summary of any resources, including State grants, needed by the institution t o effectively recruit and retain a culturally diverse student body. UMES effectively recruits a racially diverse student body, in large part due to its HBCU status; its gender diversity (defined as male and female) is largely balanced as well, though we need to make room for 597 Revised: April 2021 4 broadened definitions of gender diversity (LBGTQIA+). Also, our Pell- eligible levels tell us that we are effective in recruiting first -generation students, but less so from families with more financial resources. The resources UMES needs to effectively recruit and retain all students, however, lie in the area of foundational program development and student success support. We need the following: 1-2 full time personnel in transfer support (recruitment and in advis ing) 2-3 student advisors, who are highly skilled in working with the needs of first -generation students Development of a central international student center, whose focus is to work with admissions, with advising, and with faculty to support international students at the school, as well as to encourage native students to travel outside the country We are developing a new co -requisite Mathematics Program to serve first- year students' needs so that our DFW rates in bottleneck Mathematics courses do not preve nt students from advancing in their STEM majors; we are in need of more infrastructural help to make the necessary tutorial support run well. The University of Maryland Eastern Shore Cultural Diversity Plan An intentional focus on diversity at all levels of the University is essential to our academic mission, purpose and viability. Fully embracing the concept of diversity is necessary for achieving a vibrant, inclusive community that reflects the world beyond the Eastern Shore, challenges and encourages us to broaden our perspectives and worldviews and helps to fully prepare students to make valuable contributions as citizens of a diverse and globally integrated society. The University has developed this \"Di versity Plan\" in accordance with Senate Bill 438 and House Bill 905, identical bills entitled \"Institutions of Higher Education - Plans for Program of Cultural Diversity.\" According to a letter from Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler, dated May 15 th, 2008, to the Honorable Martin J. O'Malley, Governor of Maryland: \"The bills also require public institutions to develop and implement a wide range of elements to be included in the plans, including processes for reporting campus -based hate crimes, program ming to enhance cultural diversity sensitivity through training of students faculty and staff, and a summary of resources needed to effectively recruit and retain a culturally diverse student body.\" Diversity Vision Statement Diversity is one of the UM ES core values. In developing and nurturing a diverse and inclusive community, we respect and engage across difference. We face and respond thoughtfully and responsibly to difficult questions. We build bridges and establish relationships. Individually and as a community, we critically examine and challenge our biases, assumptions, institutional structures and worldviews. We understand and seek to mitigate inequities through meaningful diversity experiences. 598 Revised: April 2021 5 Commitment to Diversity The University of Maryl and Eastern Shore's diversity efforts broaden and deepen our personal and intellectual understanding, preparing all of us - students, staff, and faculty - to make thoughtful, responsible contributions as individuals, community members, and professionals in a diverse and globally integrated world. The UMES understanding of diversity is broad -based, emphasizing the identities and experiences of groups that have been historically under-represented in higher education, and encompassing age, class, culture, (dis )ability, ethnicity, gender identity, gender expression, immigration status, national origin, race, religion and spirituality, sex and sexual identity, veteran status, among others. We affirm that diverse experiences and perspectives in the classroom and across campus enhance everyone's educational experience. Diversity Goals Core Principle/Goal #1 : Improve the diversity of the UMES campus community. Core Principle/Goal #2 : Develop and maintain a campus climate and culture in which embracing diversity is a core value enacted by all members of the UMES community. Core Principle/Goal #3 : Enhance students' diversity related educational opportunities and experiences to ensure that all students graduate with knowledge and skills necessary for living and working effectively as members of a diverse, global society. Core Principle/Goal #4 : Reflect institutional commitment to diversity by establishing a culture of accountability around diversity initiatives, practices, and policies. Plan of Action UMES started the process of re-imagining our diversity strategic plan. Phase One : In 2019, the University submitted a framework to update and enhance our plan. Phase Two : In 2020, UMES utilized the Standards of Professional Practices for Chief Diversity Officers from the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education as a guide and foundation for best practices to create and develop core goals, objectives, strategies, and methods for accomplishing areas in the plan. Phase Three : In 2021-22, UMES will work to finalize the plan through a Diversity Council complete with members of the University community. 599 Revised: April 2021 6 University of Maryland Eastern Shore Institutional Plan for Cultural Diversity Interim Plan for 2020- 2021 (Phase 1) Strategic Diversity Goals : The broad goals and framework are structured around four core diversity principles that have been central to developing a sustainable institutional frame work and set of initiatives focused on cultural diversity.

Note : Information developed through the Standards of Professional Practices for Chief Diversity Officers from the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. Multiple diversity strategic plans were reviewed from various colleges and universities. Common core principles and goals were utilized in the updated plan 605UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND GLOBAL CAMPUS 606 3501 University Boulevard Office of Diversity and Equity Cultural Diversity Report University of Maryland Global Campus April 12, 2021 Description of how the institution defines diversity (no more than one page); how did the institution develop that definition (e.g. processes, sources, and guidance used)? At the University of Maryland Global Campus diversity is defined as all of the visible and invisible characteristics that make each of our staff, faculty, and students unique. It is believed that organizational diversity has an impact on performance, innovation, and adaptability, and how individuals will respond during their organizational life (Pfeffer, 1983). The Equal Employment Act initially defined diversity in terms of race, gender, ethnicity, age, national origin, religion, or disabi lity. At UMGC, the definition has been broadened to treat diversity as a celebration of differences related to a wide -range of diversity characteristics and identities. UMGC Diversity Characteristics and Identities race gender age language physical characteristics disability sexual orientation gender identity economic status parental status education geographic origin profession lifestyle religion veteran status (Hollister & Hodgson, 1996) UMGC's diversity efforts are divided into programming focused on diversity and programming focused on inclusion. Diversity is considered to be valuing individual differences through action and ensuring that we are doing the right thing for the UMGC Communi ty. UMGC Inclusion efforts focus on all the ways we respect and welcome people who are different from us into the UMGC Community through the removal of systemic barriers and through promoting equity and fairness for all. 607 3501 University Boulevard Office of Diversity and Equity Brief highlight of the most successful ongoing and new institutional initiatives designed to address issues related to cultural diversity within the campus and the broader community, and how their efficacy is measured UMGC's Heritage Month Celebrations are at the heart of our efforts to rec ognize, celebrate, and raise awareness of the cultures and heritages that comprise the UMGC Community. During monthly events, UMGC's Diversity and Equity Office invites speakers to address the community and will also host documentary viewings that aim to increase the knowledge and understanding of diversity and culture. These themes and cultures are further celebrated by the distribution of the diversity poster series that includes monthly posters that are shared across the university. Over the course of th e past year, social and racial justice initiatives have been at the forefront of diversity programs. At UMGC, the Diversity Dialogue Series has been implemented to provide a forum for staff and faculty to discuss issues that they are experiencing in their communities and at work. These sessions are facilitated by the Chief Diversity Officer and the only ask is that individuals come prepared to be vulnerable and visible during the conversations. Topics that have been explored include empathy vs sympathy; allyship; race at work; privilege; and using one's voice to support your community. The Diversity and Equity Office has also launched the Inclusion Networks program. Inclusion Networks are UMGC's version of an Employee Resource or Affinity Group that are based on race, gender, and gender identity and orientation as part of our plan and mission to create and cultivate a culture where everyone feels welcome to bring their full selves . These networks throughout the university are grassroots groups led by staff and supported by the Diversity and Equity Office with resources and guidance. The networks allow staff across the university to take ownership of diversity programs that are geared towards their constituent members. The Networks have become a valuable resour ce for providing feedback to leadership and building community. 608 3501 University Boulevard East, Office of Diversity and Equity A brief discussion of the ways in which the institution anticipates COVID -19 most affecting - either negatively or positively - efforts to enhance diversity on campus. COVID- 19 has required us to shift the delivery of diversity training and awareness programs from in -person to virtual platforms. While this initially had some individuals feeling disconnected from one another, it ultimately resulted in the ability for more training and programmin g to reach individuals who previously may have been unavailable to attend in person sessions. Additionally, it increased the reach of the programs to individuals that live outside of the DC Metropolitan Area. Specifically, it allowed UMGC staff and faculty located in offices in the United States, Europe, and Asia to participate in diversity sessions alongside one another. That opportunity had rarely (if ever) presented itself previously. As we prepare for a return to campus, university leadership is closely monitoring the impact that any return will have on individuals with ongoing health concerns and those with school -age children. The 'Future of Work' team has ensured that the remote working and tele -work options will remain in place for some staff who may have extenuating circumstances. Additionally, there is still a good deal of uncertainty regarding how school -aged children will be returning to school in the fall. This could potentially have an impact on how those with school -aged children will need to s upport students who could still be learning virtually or for those who are unable to secure child care. Flexibility will remain part of the planning going forward and there will not be a one -size fits all approach to what returning to work will look like a cross departments, offices, or regions. 609 3501 University Boulevard East, Office of Diversity and Equity Institutional Plan for Cultural Diversity University of Maryland Global Campus 2020- 2021 I. Implementation strategy and a timeline for meeting goals within the plan The Office of Diversity and Equity was established in April 2000 to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion for students, fa culty, and staff across the University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC). The office is responsible for ensu ring compliance with Equ al Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and Americans with Disabilities (ADA) policies. We assist all university departments and divisions to resol ve affirmative action, discrimination, sexual misconduct, and ADA issues that may interfere with employees' ability to participate in programs and activities, perform work, and provide services in the workplace. This office drives UMGC 's commitment to foster diverse and inclusive working and learning environments. Our office also offers diversity and compliance training so that the UMGC community will have the skills and insights necessary to promote engagement, inclusion, productivity, and professionalism. The Office of Diversity and Equity Office includes the following units: 610 3501 University Boulevard Diversity and Equity UMGC has long recognized that cultural diversity of students, faculty and staff must be an institution -wide characteristic. With that in mind, UMGC has, through the Office of Diversity and Equity and the Organizational Development Unit , developed and regularly conducts training and development, and awareness programs that address cultural divers ity (Appendix 1). The programs ensure that UMGC maintains high standards in its recruiting, cultivation and development of staff and faculty while promoting cultural diversity. In addition to the training programs, the University has adopted and implemented core values that promote cultural diversity, creativity and respect of all individuals. These core values permeate all activities within the University. Together with our ever improving practices these 611 3501 University Boulevard Office of Diversity and Equity core values serve as the underpinning of the successes UMGC has achieved in cultural diversity of its students, faculty and staff. UMGC 's Core Values may best be described as Small Acts or attitudes that we enact in our everyday work lives. Here are some everyday acts that convey UMGC's core values: 1. Students First : Educating students is our purpose. 2. Excellence : Outstanding quality is the hallmark of our work. 3. Accountability: We are each responsible for our actions and UMGC 's success. 4. Integrity: Our principles and standards are never compromised. 5. Innovation : We advance so others can benefit from our leadership. 6. Diversity: Each individual brings value to our University and our results. 7. Respect: The rights and feelings of others are always considered. 8. People Always : Our faculty and staff represent our differentiator and competitive advantage Overall, UMGC 's Diversity Plan is one that actively monitors the diversity of its staff, students, and faculty to ensure that cultural diversity, and healthy and respectful workplaces are maintained, and that practices and policies are fairly and equitably applied across all levels within the organization. Our intent i s to ensure that we continue to attract and hire diverse employees; that we create a learning environment that allows students from all backgrounds to succeed; that we maintain a p ositive human relations climate; and that we respect our cultural diversity. Where necessary our programs and practices will be adjusted, updated and improved using current information and prudent judgments. UMGC's focus on diversity growth and cultural inclusivity will continue to position us as a leader in higher education by: Advancing women and ethnic minorities Ensuring that talent pipelines contain strong, diverse candidates Curtailing turnover of diverse staff, particularly at senior levels, which tends to be highly visible and demoralizing to oth er diverse staff Strengthen ing visible leadership commitment to diversity 612 3501 University Boulevard Office of Diversity and Equity Aligning diversity with business goals and current initiatives Fostering enthusiasm for diversity change across the university Our mission aims to support the UMGC community through strategic planning and oversight 613 3501 University Boulevard East, Office of Diversity and Equity II. A description of the way the institution addresses cultural diversity among its student, faculty, and staff populations A. Monitoring and Reporting The University will continue to monitor the demographics of staff, students and faculty on a regular basis. Additionally, student success data, and program evaluations will be monitored to ensure the University is meeting its expectations. The offices of Human Re sources and Diversity and Equity will monitor training and e mployee development programs to ensure that cultural and human relations issues are address proactively. Currently, the office utilizes Workday analytics to maintain tracking and trend analysis of demographic data. Additionally, a nnual affirmative action p lanning allows us to determine where there may be opportunities for improvements in hiring and recruitment. The offices of Legal Affairs, Human Resources, and Diversity and Equity will also monitor the human relations climate, to include the number and types of complaints submitted, and whether hate crimes or other cultural issues are factors. These offices will prepare a combined report on the Human Relations Climate at the University for review by senior university leaders. The report will address, at a minimum, whether cultural issues affect the human relations climate of the University, the status of recruitments, demographics of employees a nd identify where under representation exists and propose both long- and short -term corrective actions. Academic an d student diversity issues will be monitored and reported by the Office of the Provost and Chief Academic Officer. B. Students In part because of its mission as a public comprehensive institution dedicated solely to meeting the higher education needs o f adult, \"non- traditional\" students, UMGC enjoys one of the most diverse student body of any USM institution. A glance at some characteristics of UMGC 's worldwide undergradu ate student body of more than 55,000 will give a sense of the extent to which they dif fer from the students of more traditional institutions. UMGC 's students are: 47% women 53% under -represented minorities 28% African- Americans The University's ongoing student retention initiatives show that, in terms of student retention and success, it is the adult, part -time, working nature of UMGC's students that constitutes the principal risk factor for failure to succeed. UMGC has in place progra ms and ini tiatives to increase the success of its culturally diverse student body. It also has educational offerings geared toward raising awarenes s of diversity issues among students pursuing a variety of careers. The UMGC Strategic Plan also addresses UMGC's commi tment to providing quality educational programs that meet the career goals of its students across the globe. C. Academic Programs The Behavioral Sciences Programs have developed courses to increase and expand knowledge a round diversity and inclusion. Stude nts across the university participate in these elective courses to increase their awareness of diversity and to prepare them for their future careers. These courses include: BEHS 220 - Diversity Awareness BEHS 320 - Disability Studies BEHS 34 - Parenting Today BEHS 380 - End of Life: Issues and Perspectives (formerly Gerontology) BEHS 453 - Domestic Violence BEHS 343 - Parenting Today D. Faculty In addition to the programs offered by UMGC's Office of Diversity and Equity, faculty members also receive supp ort from the Faculty Development Office. Faculty Development host Lunch and Learn webinars and Community Meet -ups to address and discuss a wide range of 615 3501 University Boulevard East, Office of Diversity and Equity topics that faculty need to consider when working with the diverse UMGC student body . These live sessions are hosted in Zoom and discuss relevant topics for higher education, technology, and pedagogy. The Faculty Development Unit ensures that staff receive regular training and development opportunities. Programming include s workshops and webinars including, but not limited to : Digital Rights and the Americ an with Disabilities Act (ADA) Military Spouse Motivation Military initiatives - Overview of Success \"Understanding and Working with Students with Disabilities \" Title IX Avoiding Sexual Harassment in Preventing Sexual Violence EEO and Fostering Inclusive Practices in the classroom E. Staff UMGC is committed to the hiring and retention of diverse employees from a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. Ongoing review of the representation of diverse staff reporting to and/or working throughout the State of Maryland suggests that the University is maintaining a culturally diverse workforce. Through Affirmative Action planning and consistent review of internal recruitment practices we are able to identify areas where the diversity of UMGC staff may need improvement. Minorities and women are not significantly under represented or concentrated in any particular organizational unit. This does not mean that there is not more work to be done. The University continues to explore hiring, retention, and promotion trends while ens uring that there is a sufficient talent pipeline to ensure that all staff have the ability to advance throughout their careers at the University. F. Recruitment of Staff and Faculty The University uses an interactive process for recruiting faculty and staff. The objective of this interactive process is to determine what human resources are required, ensuring that position description accurately reflect the skills needed and to recruit in the widest possib le areas and using a combination of electronic, print media, and face to face recruiting methodologies. 616 3501 University Boulevard East, Diversity and Equity Staff recruitment sources i nclude, but are not limited to, various job fairs, local newspapers, professional publications, and organizations. The University prepares and maintains a Faculty Recruitment Plan in its efforts to recruit a diverse body of faculty. 617 3501 University Boulevard East, Office of Diversity and Equity III. Description of how the institution plans to enhance cultural diversity (if improvement is needed); As we review current diversity training and programming, we have instituted new training criteria to ensure that diversity tr aining will be rolled out at all levels of the university. Executive Committee, President's Cabinet, and staff across the university will all be offered training to further their diversity knowledge and education. This training will consist of workshops and webinars related to Microaggressions, Unconscious Bias, Race and Social Justice in Higher Education, etc. Further, we will be engaging staff and faculty in conversations designed to further their exploration and understanding of ra ce, social justice, inclusivity, and racial inequities . These are designed to be small group facilitated discussions that require courage, vulnerability, and transparency. IV. Addressing Hate Crimes: The University is keenly aware of the possibility that hate crimes may occur on its campuses and facilities. The cultural diversity programs in place serve as preventive measures to hate crimes. However, in the event an incident occurs, the University is pr epared to respond and take immediate corrective actions. The University's response team consists of the Fair Practices Unit (comprised of the Fair practices Officer, EEO, and the Office of Legal Affairs), Office of Human Resources, the Resolution Emergency Assessment Crisis team (REACT), the University Security Team and the University of Maryland Police. These gr oups form a primary and secondary response approach to any incident depending on the severity of the incident. Public spaces of UMGC 's facilities are periodically inspected to determine if hate graffiti in any form have been posted. When detected immediate action is taken to report and eradicate such graffiti. The University plans to continue its vigilant monitoring of hate crimes, respond to incidents immediately upon having knowled ge, to investigate, resolve, and take appropriate corrective actions as nee d. V. Summary of Resources UMGC will continue to develop and enhance its programs through prudent use of current budgets and available grants. Key recommendations outside of the current plan are regularly considered in the context of the University strategic priorities. T he President's Office 618 3501 University Boulevard Office of Diversity and Equity and Executive Committee support the use of investment dollars to further the diversity and inclusion effo rts as part of the strategic investment into the people that make up the University community. 619 3501 University Boulevard East, Diversity and Equity Appendix 1.

' f- 1 HI-'l\"l1RIO Morgan State University Cultural Diversity Report AV 2020-2021 Submitted to: Maryland Higher Education Commission 6232 INTRODUCTION By action of the 2017, Maryland Legislature, Morgan State University {Morgan) has been designated as Maryland's Preeminent Public Urban Research University with the responsibility of addressing the needs of residents, schools, and organizations within the Baltimore Metropolitan Area. Morgan has been an important part of the higher education system in Baltimore City, the State of Maryland, and the nation. Throughout its history, Morgan has served the community with distinction while meeting the educational needs of an increasingly diverse society. I. Morgan's Definition of Diversity and How It Was Developed Diversity is embraced at Morgan as one of its institutional core values. \"A broad diversity of people and ideas are welcomed and supported at Morgan as essential to quality education in a global interdependent society. Students will have reasonable and affordable access to a comprehensive range of high quality educational programs and services.\" This core value stems from Morgan's mission to encourage the pursuit of knowledge informed by a free marketplace of ideas. The knowledge acquired in that marketplace comes closest to truth when a diverse assembly of faculty, students, and staff are able to compare their personal as well as professional information, data, and beliefs against a community comprised of people of all races, ethnicities, colors, genders, religions, and socio-economic statuses. Morgan's motto, \"Growing the Future, Leading the World,\" also highlights the importance that diversity plays in its mission to educate and impact the global community. Morgan serves as an intellectual and creative resource to the community, state, nation, and world, by supporting, empowering and preparing high-quality, diverse graduates to lead the world. Considering its core value and motto, Morgan embraces cultural diversity in its broadest sense. Its diversity efforts focus attention to underrepresented racial and ethnic groups who have been marginalized. Additionally, diversity at Morgan also encompasses a commitment to enhancing the equity and inclusion of women, those who are economically disadvantaged, and those of different sexual orientations, religions, and abilities. In summary, Morgan's mission is to serve a multi-ethnic and multi-racial student body and to help ensure that the benefits of higher education are enjoyed by a broad segment of the population. Achieving and maintaining a diverse student body, faculty, and staff, is a compelling interest and important goal for Morgan. Thus, Morgan's Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity {Diversity Plan) sets forth 33 goals in six core areas: 1) Students (undergraduate, graduate, and non-traditional); 2) Faculty and Staff; 3) Curricular; 4) Socio-economic; 5) Disability; and 6) Community Engagement. An assessment plan with goals, objectives, anticipated outcomes, measurements/benchmarks, assessment methods, and responsibility was developed for each core area and goal. (See Attachment #1). Successful implementation of the goals in the Diversity Plan requires the coordinated and sustained efforts of all members of the University community and the systematic assessment of progress toward the goals. 6243 2. Morgan's Most Successful Ongoing and New Initiatives Ongoing Initiatives Morgan's Center for Continuing and Professional Studies (CCPS) is designed to serve the lifelong educational needs of traditional and non-traditional students from culturally diverse populations in Baltimore City, Maryland, nationally, and internationally who are pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees as well as professional and personal growth. CCPS offers the Bernard Osher Scholarship Program which provides scholarships to promising students, ages 25-50, who have experienced an educational gap of five years or more and are returning to complete a bachelor's degree on a full-time or part-time basis. Since receiving the initial award in 2008, CCPS secured a $1M endowment from the Bernard Osher Foundation to provide financial support to adult students. To date, 107 students have graduated as Bernard Osher Scholars. The success of the Osher Scholarship Program has resulted in the funding of another award, the Crankstart Reentry Scholarship Program, in November 2016. This scholarship funds an additional 20 adult students, ages 25-50 who have experienced a break in their education of five years or more and are returning to complete undergraduate degrees. From 2016 to the present, the Crankstart Foundation has continued its support of non-traditional students by renewing the two-year agreement in 2018-2020 awarding $200,000, and awarding $220,000 in 2020- 2021. In total, 29 students who have received Crankstart scholarships have earned bachelor's degrees. Morgan's Improved Opportunities for Parents (IOP) Program was initiated in 1983 to assist low-income Maryland residents, especially parents, who meet established criteria in obtaining a bachelor's degree. A bridge grant in the amount of approximately $40,000 is provided by Morgan each year. This program offers the nontraditional adult student a support system and access to University resources. To date, 205 parent-students have graduated from Morgan. Twenty (20) student-parents, 17 females and 3 males received IOP funds during AV 2020-2021, and eight (8) of those students graduated. New Initiatives The Office of Student Disability Support Services, a unit under the auspices of Academic Affairs, promotes diversity, equal access for students with disabilities, disability awareness, and self-advocacy skills to create an inclusive environment allowing students to reach their academic and career goals. In AV 2020-2021, SDSS launched and maintained a social media presence on lnstagram to reach and stay connected with current and prospective Morgan students and the public. With the establishment of the LBGTOA Advisory Council in 2013, Morgan has taken proactive steps to provide a safe and inclusive environment for LBGTOA students, faculty and staff. To further these efforts, Morgan honored International Transgender Day of Visibility on March 31, 2021, with an inaugural celebration, \"A Day in Their Shoes\" hosted by Latinx, Latin American, and Caribbean Studies; Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies, and the Office of Diversity & EEO. This year's event, conducted online and attended by students and faculty, featured a foreign film about a transwomen's experience followed by an audience discussion. Using the theme \"A Day in Their Shoes\" every year, Morgan will host a day of programs, activities, and events geared towards raising awareness and being inclusive of all gender identities and expressions. 6254 3. The Anticipated Impact on Morgan's Efforts to Enhance Cultural Diversity Morgan has experienced marked increases in the total number of undergraduate and graduate students who identify as international, Hispanic, or White between AV 2010 to AV 2021. (See attached Table). The Covid-19 pandemic caused a drastic shift from face-to-face learning to online/remote learning for all students, resulting in a surge in the number of online/remote instructors, and a sharp increase in online enrollment. Three hundred twenty-four (324) faculty members were trained to provide quality online instruction. The impact of Morgan Online, Maryland Online, and required competency training is reflected in the surge in student enrollment in online courses since the 2013-2014 academic year where enrollment increased from 176 students in hybrid courses and 1,807 students in online courses during the 2013-2014 academic year to 541 students in hybrid courses and 5379 students in on line courses during AV 20120-2021 . The Morgan Online director, an African American woman, serves as the President of Maryland Online. (www.Marylandonline .org) A notable impact occurred in the Division of International Affairs/ the Center for Global Studies and International Education , which supports the exchange of visiting scholars who participate in work-and study-based exchange visitor programs . This exchange of visitors promotes interchange, mutual enrichme nt, and linkages between research and educational institutions in U.S. and foreign countries . Particularly at Morgan, it helps to diversify our research interests and increase mutual understanding between populations of the United States and those of other countries through educationa l and cultural exchanges . Due to the global pandemic, an average of 6 participants was reduced to three individuals , emanating from Ghana, India, and Turkey. Additionally, due to the global pandemic, the Division of International Affairs/ the Office of Study Abroad (OSA) halted all in-person study abroad until Summer 2022. However, through innovation and leadership, OSA continued to engage students by developing virtual study abroad opportunit ies and virtual exchange/ collaborative online international learning programming with the Office of Global Cross Cultural Programs. Seventy-seven (77) students, total from Spring 2020 to Spring 2021, have participated in experiential learning experiences in Guatemala, Japan, the Middle East, North Africa, and Spain. Additional virtual exchange programs are planned for Summer 2021 and Fall 2021. Even with the impact of COVID, Morgan has maintained its core value and mission of diversity by adapting in ways, not only to survive, but to thrive in this global pandemic . Morgan's Cultural Diversity Plan was set to expire in Academic Year (AV) 2020-2021. However, constructing a new Diversity Plan, during a global pandemic causing such uncertainty, would be counterintuitive to how Morgan operates as a leader in diversity. As such, the Board of Regents has approved a one-year extension of Morgan's current Diversity Plan with the intention that this additional year will enable Morgan to better assess its diversity goals and programs with an eye towards achieving diversity and excellence in a post-vaccinated world. 626Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan State University Presented to David Wilson President Morgan State University Board of Regents Academic and Student Affairs Committee May 3, 2011 627Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University Table of Contents Introduction to Morgan State University Maryland's Diversity Mandate The Demographic Context for Diversity in Maryland Morgan State University's Diversity Mission Growing Diversity at Morgan Faculty.

As such, achieving and maintaining a diverse student body as well as a diverse faculty and staff is a compelling interest and important goal for Morgan. Among the chief strategies employed by Morgan to enhance diversity is offering a comprehensive program of studies leading to the awarding of degrees at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral levels. Morgan is one of the few HBCUs offering such an expansive range of academic programs from the bachelor's degree through the doctorate. Morgan currently awards degrees in fifteen doctoral programs, thirty master's programs, and more than forty baccalaureate programs. Morgan also houses a number of research programs and offers a variety of public services to the larger Baltimore metropolitan community. The University enrolls approximately 7,000 students from throughout the United States and numerous foreign countries. The Academic Division of the University is organized around the College of Liberal Arts, the School of Architecture and Planning, the Earl Graves School of Business and Management, the School of Computer, Mathematical and Natural Sciences, the School of Community Health and Policy, the School of Education and Urban Studies, the School of Engineering, the School of Social Work, and the School of Graduate Studies. Morgan is also fully accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and by the Maryland State Department of Education. Maryland's Diversity Mandate As required in the Education Article, Annotated Code of Maryland,\u00a7 11-406 (b)(1)(i) each public institution of higher education in the State shall develop and implement a plan for a program of cultural diversity. Within the meaning of the statute, \"cultural diversity\" means the inclusion of those racial and ethnic groups and individuals that are or have been underrepresented in higher education\u00a7 11-406 (a). The plan shall enhance cultural diversity programming and sensitivity to cultural diversity through instruction and training of the student body, faculty, and staff at the institution of higher education\u00a7 11-406 (b)(3). Specifically, the statute requires that the cultural diversity plan include: a description of the way the institution addresses cultural diversity among its students, faculty and staff populations; a description of how the institution plans to enhance cultural diversity, if improvement is needed; a process for reporting campus-based hate crimes consistent with federal requirements under the Clery Act; a summary of resources needed, including State grants, to effectively recruit and retain a culturally diverse student body; and, 41Page 630Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University the enhancement of cultural diversity programming and sensitivity to cultural diversity through instruction and training of the student body, faculty, and staff of the institution\u00a7 11-406 (b)(2)(i)-(iv). The cultural diversity plan must be submitted to the institution's governing board for its review by May 1st\u00a7 11-406 (c)(1 ). Following its review of the plan, the governing board must submit a progress report on the institution's implementation of the plan to the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC) by August 111 \u00a7 11-406 (c)(2). The Demographic Context for Diversity in Maryland The pursuit of diversity occurs, however, in the context of the demographic and socio\u00ad economic trends in the State of Maryland. Census data show that from 2000 to 2008 Maryland lost about 15% of its white population. These data also show that the minority population comprises 42.3% of the 5.6 million 2008 Maryland residents up from a 37 .6% minority population in 2000. The percent minority population is greatest in the Suburban Washington region (58.1%), the Baltimore region (37.9%), and the Lower Eastern Shore region (29.6%). According to census data analyzed by Mark Goldstein, Principal Planner for the Maryland Department of Planning (MDP), Maryland's non-Hispanic white population declined by 18,350 (-0.6%) between July 1, 2007 and July 1, 2008, the fifth successive annual loss, although slightly below the declines in the previous two years. With the latest loss in non-Hispanic whites, minority population gains once again accounted for all of the State's population growth for the fifth year in a row. In addition, for the fourth year in a row, Hispanics (of any race) made up the largest share of the State's population gains. mgoldstein@mdp.state.md.us Maryland's general population is 29% African American, the fourth highest percent of any state. Its public school system is 40% African American and its college age population holding a high school diploma is 33% African American. The Hispanic and Asian-American populations of the State are considerably smaller but they are young and growing rapidly. Meanwhile, the white public school population in Maryland is declining and the white college-age population, which currently is at a peak, is about to begin a long-term decline and be replaced by minority students with distinctly different educational and socioeconomic characteristics. Morgan State University's Diversity Mission Morgan's mission is to serve a multi-ethnic and multi-racial student body and to help ensure that the benefits of higher education are enjoyed by a broad segment of the population. As approved by the Board of Regents (M-1 ), the mission statement provides in relevant part that SI Page 631Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University These characteristics as well as its tradition of serving an academically and demographically diverse student body place it in a unique position among Maryland institutions to serve the increasingly heterogeneous population of the state and the special needs of Baltimore City. While committed to educating a culturally diverse and multi-racial population, the University also makes an important contribution to increasing the educational attainment of Maryland's rapidly-growing African-American population in fields and at degree levels where it is under-represented. Board policies, www.morgancounsel.org/policies procedures.html, reinforce Morgan's diversity mission including, but not necessarily limited to: A-6 University Guidelines Governing AIDS N-3 Policy on Nondiscrimination S-2 Policy on Sexual Assault S-3 Policy Prohibiting Sexual Harassment and Procedures for Complaints of Sexual Harassment The core value in Morgan's diversity mission is the pursuit of knowledge informed by a free marketplace of ideas. The knowledge acquired in that marketplace comes closest to truth when a diverse assembly of faculty, students, and staff are able to compare their personal as well as professional information, data, and beliefs against a community comprised of people of all races, ethnicities, colors, genders, religions, and socio\u00ad economic statuses. Towards that end, Morgan has a compelling interest in pursuing its diversity mission. Morgan's Strategic Plan, 2008-2012, reflects goals and strategies approved by the Board of Regents in 2007 to enhance cultural diversity in the context of Morgan's mission, vision and core values. Of the eight strategic goals identified in the 2008-2012 Strategic Plan, for example, the specific focus of goal 6 is attracting a racially diverse student body. Extend recruitment and community service programs beyond the University's traditional service areas to strengthen its competitive position and attract a racially diverse student body. The strategic plan identifies several strategies needed to realize goal 6, attracting a racially diverse student body, including: Broaden student recruitment and service programs to parts of the state experiencing significant changes in the demographics of their population. Increase the number of freshmen and transfer students enrolling from outside of Baltimore City. GI Page 632Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University Increase the percentage of non-African-Americans enrolling at the University. Develop off-campus programs and courses in rapidly-growing areas of the state Market University strengths in promoting student success and in offering a student-centered environment. Market high school-to-college transition programs. Utilize, effectively, the alumni network for marketing and recruitment (pgs. 35 and 36). Morgan has undertaken the development of Growing the Future, Leading the World: A Strategic Plan for Morgan State University, 2011 -2021. This strategic plan, like its predecessor, will incorporate cultural diversity as one of Morgan's enduring values. The new strategic plan's focus on Growing the Future and Leading the World will necessarily include goals and strategies that promote cultural diversity at Morgan not only among faculty, students, and staff who are citizens of Maryland and the nation but the new plan will also, of necessity, include goals and strategies that promote a more global understanding of diversity. In contrast to Morgan's 2008-2012 five year strategic plan, however, the new strategic plan anticipates a longer time frame (i.e., 10 years) in which to achieve plan goals and incorporates a capital campaign. Growing Diversity at Morgan Faculty. Among the topics discussed by the faculty in their review of strategic plan goals at their spring 2011 Faculty Institute was the meaning of diversity at Morgan. The faculty acknowledged the existing cultural diversity present throughout the University community. As of the fall 2010 semester, for example, forty (40%) percent of the total faculty were women; and they were fifty-one (51 %) percent of the faculty holding the rank of assistant professor. Caucasians, Asians and Native Americans comprised forty\u00ad seven (4 7%) of the faculty. See Table 1: MSU Fall 2010 Full-Time Faculty by Race, Tenure Status, and Rank (Appendix 1 ). The diversity of the faculty could be improved, however, with the addition of Hispanics at all ranks and tenured female faculty, particularly native Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. Goal 1: Encourage and monitor the recruitment of Hispanic faculty at all ranks from Instructor through Professor. Goal 2: Encourage and monitor the recruitment of Native American female faculty at all ranks from Instructor through Professor. 71Page 633Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University Undergraduate Students. Table 2 depicts MSU fall 2010 Undergraduate Enrollment by Race and Class Status. Table 2 reveals that of the six thousand, six hundred and twenty-two (6622) undergraduate students enrolled during fall 2010 semester, five thousand, nine hundred and one (5,901) or eighty-nine (89%) percent were enrolled full\u00ad time. Women comprised fifty-six (56%) percent of the undergraduates. Professional Women's Magazine (www.professionalwomanmag.com) ranked Morgan the Best of the Best in 2010 among colleges and universities in providing instructional and support services to women. African Americans represent eighty-two (82%) percent of the total undergraduate students enrolled at Morgan. Seven (7%) percent of the undergraduates identify themselves as multiracial, about one (1.3%) percent as Caucasian, and about two (1.8%) percent as an Asian. See Table 2 attached as Appendix 2. Three (3%) percent of undergraduate students enrolled in the fall 2010 semester report their ethnicity as Hispanic. The Hispanic Network, a lifestyle business and employment magazine (www.hnmagazine.com) has recognized the University's welcoming and supportive environment for a diverse student body ranking Morgan among the \"Top 25 Colleges and Universities for Hispanics.\" As part of its diversity mission and consistent with its 2011-2021 strategic plan, Morgan has established several goals related to increasing enrollment among a diverse undergraduate student body and providing support services to enhance undergraduate student success. Goal 3: Continue to recruit, admit, retain and graduate greater numbers of Caucasian undergraduate students. Goal 4: Continue to recruit, admit, retain and graduate greater numbers of Hispanic undergraduate students. Goal 5: Continue to recruit, admit, retain and graduate greater numbers of Asian undergraduate students. Socio-Economic Diversity. A free marketplace of ideas that contributes to a university's storehouse of knowledge about cultural diversity contains faculty, staff, and students who are not only of different races and ethnicities but who are also from diverse economic backgrounds. The data in Tables 3 through 5 below present the median family income, Pell grant status, and single family household status of Morgan students as compared to their State and/or National cohorts. These data reveal that the median family income of students attending Morgan is almost half that of other families in Maryland and over $15,000 less than the median family income for the United States (Table 3). The Federal Pell Grant program was instituted to give students that could not otherwise afford it the financial aid they need to attend a college or university. Table 4 demonstrates that students at Morgan are almost twice as likely to qualify for Pell grants as other Maryland students. Nationally, about a third of students qualify for Pell grants as compared to half of the students attending Morgan. Additionally, more than half the SI Page 634Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University \u00b7freshmen enrolling in Morgan are from single parent households (Table 5) while less than a quarter of the freshmen enrolling nationally in a college or university were from a single parent household. Table 3 Median Income 2008 Data Morgan* Marvland National *Adjusted gross income Sources: Morgan data: Financial Aid Information System Maryland and National data: U.S. Census Bureau Table4 P t P II R . . t 2008 2009 D t ercen e ecI0Ien s -aa Moroan Maryland National $70,545 $52,029 50% 28% 35% Maryland and National data: Pell Grant Recipients as a Percentage of Pell-Eligible Undergraduate Enrollment by Institutional Type/Control and State 1993-4 to 2008-09 http://www.postsecondary.org/topicslist.asp?page=1&od=&search=Pell%20grant s Table 5 Percent Freshmen from Single Parent Households 2008 Data I Morgan National Source: 157% 22% UCLA Higher Education Research Institute Freshmen Survey In summary, these data demonstrate that a majority of Morgan's undergraduate students are from low income families. Both the University and the students would benefit from a more economically diverse student body. Morgan's balance sheet would benefit from a larger number of students who could afford to pay more for their instructional services. The students would benefit from association with peers whose financial status offers a different picture of economic realities and occupational or vocational possibilities. Thus, Morgan has established the goal of increasing enrollment of undergraduate students from among a higher socioeconomic status. 9IPage 635Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University Goal 6: Increase the percent enrollment of undergraduate students at Morgan from families whose income is at or above the 2008 -2009 national median income level of $52,029. Disability Diversity. Morgan embraces the contribution that persons with disabilities make to the marketplace of ideas and to a community's storehouse of knowledge. In addition to compliance with section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 19731 and Title 112 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), Morgan is a full partner with the State's Skills2Compete3 goals as it relates to preparing students with disabilities with \"the skills and credentials they need to get good jobs with family supporting wages.\" Morgan's Policy on Nondiscrimination (i.e., Board of Regent Policy N-3) prohibits, in relevant part, conduct (oral, written, graphic, or physical) directed against any person or group of persons because of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status or disability and that has the purpose or reasonably foreseeable effect of creating an offensive, demeaning, intimidating, or hostile environment for that person or group of persons. Beyond federal and state regulatory requirements, Morgan has taken affirmative steps to enhance the presence of and support for disabled students on campus. Notably, the Office of Student Accessibility and Support Services (SASS) has received an AT&T - NAFEO Inclusion Scholars Program-ISP grant to award an incoming freshman with disabilities a scholarship of $9,000 per year, for each of four years of their matriculation, for a total of $36,000 in scholarship assistance. See award letter attached as Appendix 3. Consistent with the AT&T -NAFEO ISP grant, the SASS office and the Center for Career Development (CCD) have established several goals designed to enhance employment opportunities for students with disabilities. Goal 7: Encourage better self advocacy of students with disabilities by helping to build resume and interviewing skills, and by assisting in the creation of an organization for students with disabilities run by students with disabilities with support from CCD. Goal 8: Create an environment that encourages reluctant students to self-identify, which in turn will help the CCD staff to determine how to improve the delivery of career planning and placement services to students with disabilities. 1 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits recipients of federal funds from discriminating on the basis of disability. 2 Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in state and local government services by state and local governmental entities. 3 Skills2Compete Maryland (S2C) is Governor O'Malley's vision for Marylanders to gain the skills and credentials they need to get good jobs with family supporting wages. See http://www.skills.maryland.gov/ . 10 I Page 636Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University Goal 9: Expand opportunities for participation of students with disabilities in professional conferences and workshops sponsored by CCD. Goal 10: Develop and implement intentional marketing strategies and outreach programming to promote awareness and encourage use of the CCD services by students with disabilities. Goal 11: Create and present career planning sessions that address issues and concerns that may be pertinent to students with disabilities. Goal 12: Insure physical and program access at CCD sponsored activities for students with disabilities. Goal 13: Designate specific CCD staff to work with disabled students and serve as a liaison between CCD and the students with disabilities and insure that the designated staff are trained and well informed on the legal, ethical, and sensitivity issues related to providing career services to students with disabilities. Graduate Student Diversity. Table 6 depicts MSU fall 2010 Graduate Enrollment by Classification Status. Table 6 reveals that of the one thousand, one hundred and eighty-three ( 1,183) graduate students enrolled during fall 2010 semester, slightly more than half, six hundred and twenty-three (623) or fifty-three (53%), percent were enrolled full-time. At sixty-one (61%) percent of graduate students, females comprise a slightly higher percentage than the fifty-six (56%) percent they comprise of the undergraduate population. Graduate students are also generally more racially and ethnically diverse than the undergraduate students. African Americans represent seventy-four (74%) percent of the total graduate students enrolled at Morgan. Caucasian and International students each comprise ten (10%) percent of graduate student enrollment. Only two percent (N=23) identify themselves as multiracial. Similarly, Asian graduate students represent about two percent (N=23) of the total graduate student population. See Table 6 attached as Appendix 4. As part of its diversity mission and consistent with its 2011-2021 strategic plan, Morgan has established several goals related to increasing enrollment among a diverse graduate student body and providing support services to enhance graduate student success. Goal 14: Continue to recruit, admit, retain and graduate greater numbers of Hispanic graduate students. Goal 15: Continue to recruit, admit, retain and graduate greater numbers of Asian graduate students. Goal 16: Over the next ten years, increase the percent of Caucasian graduate students enrolled at Morgan. 11 I Page 637Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University Goal 17: Over the next ten years, increase the percent of International graduate students enrolled at Morgan. Nontraditional Student Diversity. An America.gov Archive (2008) article4 notes that nontraditional college-age students (age 25 or older) represent 37 percent of all United States college students. Women, in particular, constitute a majority (58 percent) of nontraditional college-age students. Military veterans also represent an increasingly important component of nontraditional students attending colleges and universities. As part of its commitment to cultural diversity, Morgan has established several goals related to providing a supportive educational environment for nontraditional students. Goal 18: Continue to recruit, admit, retain and graduate greater numbers of nontraditional undergraduate students. Goal 19: Expand academic program opportunities, including evening, weekend, and online courses and degree programs for nontraditional students. Goal 20: In collaboration with the Center for Career Development, provide professional development program sessions that meet the career needs of nontraditional students completing undergraduate programs. Goal 21: In collaboration with Morgan's Office of Veteran Services, continue to recruit, admit, retain and graduate greater numbers of military veterans in both undergraduate and graduate programs. Creating a More Diverse Community In addition to the diversity goals reflected above, this Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan also outlines a general path forward in the pursuit of initiatives that will enhance the support for a more diverse community of students and scholars. These initiatives are reflected in the following goals. University Diversity Initiatives Goal 22: Provide a nurturing environment to support academic achievement among both faculty and students at Morgan regardless of their race, color, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, age, marital status or disability. Goal 23: Create a campus-wide Diversity Advisory Group with appropriate departmental representation so that measureable goals for diversity and inclusion can be discussed and implemented and develop accountability mechanisms to assess outcomes. http://www.america.gov/st/educ-english/2008/ April/200804281212291CJsamohT0.3335382.html 12 I Page 638Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University Goal 24: Establish a Center for Conflict Resolution to support students, faculty and staff in understanding, learning, and addressing interpersonal, group, international and cross-cultural conflict. Goal 25: Collaborate with the Department of International Studies to celebrate the diversity of Morgan's campus including celebrations of the African Culture, Hispanic Awareness, and Caribbean Festivals. Curriculum Diversity Initiatives Goal 26: Establish a study abroad office within the Department of International Studies and Modern Foreign Languages .. Goal 27: Diversify the educational experiences available to undergraduate as well as graduate students by increasing opportunities for study abroad. Goal 28: Diversify the educational experiences available to faculty and students by increasing the number of exchange programs Morgan has with other colleges and universities. Goal 29: Assess whether the University's General Education requirements and courses are meeting the educational goals of increasing: Undergraduates' knowledge of diversity issues, understanding of pluralistic societies, engagement with peers from diverse backgrounds, and the development of competencies for success in a multicultural world. Interpersonal communication and acquiring the abilities to relate to and work effectively with diverse groups of people. Social responsibility and tolerance and respect for diverse groups of people and a disposition towards responsible citizenship and building a connection to the community. Faculty and Staff Diversity Initiatives Goal 30: Create a President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, available in all academic fields, for scholars whose presence will contribute to the diversity of the academic community. Goal 31: Develop an on-line training module in order to expand the knowledge of faculty and staff with regards to cultural diversity and cultural sensitivity with possible mandatory on-line training. 13 I Page 639Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University Goal 32: Support faculty and staff development opportunities to explore issues of cultural diversity in the context of teaching pedagogy, classroom dynamics, and faculty/student relations. Goal 33: Provide professional development activities that assist staff and faculty to understand their own and other cultures. Ongoing Diversity and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Activities Office of Diversity and EEO. Morgan engages in extensive programming and implements a variety of activities to support its diversity mission. Specifically, Morgan has established an Office of Diversity and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO). The Office of Diversity & EEO is charged with the day-to-day implementation of the nondiscrimination policies of Morgan State University. On an annual basis, the Diversity and EEO officer at Morgan is actively engaged in either initiating or providing active support for: implementing diversity initiatives with an emphasis on recruiting and retaining underrepresented faculty and staff. refining the hiring process for faculty and staff to increase the pool of diverse applicants. exploring with the Office of Human Resources new ways to advertise to underrepresented groups. developing a certificate system to recognize the trainee's completion of the course and to establish a record of the successful training in the Office of Human Resources. collaborating with other state and federal offices/agencies in an effort to provide any needed information and to gain additional knowledge in an effort to be most useful to the University and to the surrounding community. investigating all charges of discrimination filed by employees, staff or students informing the campus and community about the University's effort to value Diversity and Equal Employment Opportunity. promoting cultural diversity programming and sensitivity to cultural diversity through instruction and training of the student body, faculty, and staff of the institution by partnering with other established organizations on and off-campus and though a series of panel discussions offered through the University. 14 IP age 640Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University creating a Virtual Women's Center on the Diversity and EEO website to include all information, programs and activities designed and dedicated for and about women's services and issues provided on campus. partnering with student services to help ensure that students and employees with disabilities receive reasonable accommodations in the classroom and in the workplace. working with the Counseling Center to help Morgan's diverse population balance their personal lives with the rigors of academics. Jeanne Cleary Act. In compliance with the Jeanne Cleary Act and in an effort to promote the personal safety of the college community, Morgan State University produces and distributes annual reports containing crime statistics and statements of security policy. The following categories of crime for the campus, certain non-campus properties and certain public property areas that have been reported to local Police (Baltimore City Northeast District) and the MSU Police Department are disclosed for the most recent 3 years. I. Homicide II. Sex Offenses -Forcible Any sexual act directed against another person, forcibly and/or against that person's will; or not forcibly or against the person's will where the victim is incapable of giving consent. (i) Forcible Rapes (ii) Forcible Sodomy (iii) Sexual Assault with an object (iv) Forcible Fondling Ill. Sex Offenses -Non-Forcible Unlawful, non-forcible sexual intercourse. (i) Incest (ii) Statutory Rape IV. Robbery V. Aggravated Assault VI. Burglary VII. Motor Vehicle Theft 15 I Page 641Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University (i) Weapon Law Violations (ii) Drug Abuse Violations (iii) Liquor Law Violations VIII. Hate Crimes Hate crimes must also be reported by category of prejudice based on the following: race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity, or disability. Crime statistics are also compiled concerning locations: on campus, non-campus building or property; public property; and dorms/ residential. (i) On-Campus (ii) On-Campus Building or Property (iii) Public Property For the purpose of paragraph \"i\" above, on campus is defined as all main travel corridors to and from the college and the perimeter around each of Morgan's buildings. Challenges to Diversity Significant Financial Investment. The fundamental challenge to enhancing cultural diversity as reflected in the goals of this strategic plan is that the curriculum and the campus, including the facilities and infrastructure are not attractive, comparable to and competitive with other doctoral research universities that students and faculty have a choice to attend. The diversity chapter (Goal 3, pgs. 22 -30) in the 2009 Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education, for example, notes that substantial additional resources are needed to ensure that the State's public HBls with their dual missions are comparable to Maryland's TWls in their capacity to be competitive with respect to the following areas: Recruiting, retaining, and graduating an academically, racially, culturally, and ethnically diverse student body; Attracting and retaining quality faculty able to teach, conduct scholarly activities, and perform services consistent with each institution's mission; Generating external revenue by securing contracts and grants from federal and State agencies that support instructional services and enhance institutional infrastructure and facilities; and Forming partnerships with businesses and foundations that expand educational opportunities for students and that promote development in the communities proximate to the institutions. The Panel on the Comparability and Competiveness of Historically Black Institutions in Maryland established in 2008 by the Commission to Develop the Maryland Model for 16 I Page 642Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University Funding Higher Education also concluded that the HBls institutional platforms \"must provide students, faculty, and administrative staff with an attractive, safe, and administratively effective environment in which to live and work\" (pg. 113). The HBI Panel's observation that strengthening the institutional platform is also a critical element in enhancing targeted doctoral programs at the public HBls so that they achieve a very high level of excellence is particularly relevant to Morgan and its efforts to attract a diverse faculty and student body to teach and study, respectively, across its undergraduate and graduate, particularly its doctoral, programs. In summary, a major challenge in achieving the goals of cultural diversity outlined in this strategic plan is the significant financial commitment and investment in people and programs, most notably in the areas of faculty recruitment and the academic development of minority students that must be made by the State and by Morgan. Thus, consistent with the 2009 Maryland State Plan for Postsecondary Education, in order to promote a diverse student body Morgan recommends that the State expand Diversity Grants and internships awarded to eligible enrollees who are residents of the State of Maryland. Assessment of Diversity Goals. The successful implementation of the goals in this diversity strategic plan requires the coordinated and sustained efforts of all members of the University community and the systematic assessment of progress toward the goals. While all members of the Morgan community are expected to contribute to the enhancement of cultural diversity on campus, some members are more responsible than others in monitoring the initiatives and outcomes related to the diversity goals. Towards that end, an assessment plan (See Appendix 5) has been developed to facilitate the successful implementation of the goals of the Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan State University. 17 I Page 643Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan 2011 State University List of Appendices Appendix 1 Table 1: MSU Fall 2010 Full-Time Faculty by Race, Tenure Status, and Rank ........... 16 Appendix 2 Table 2: MSU Fall 2010 Undergraduate Enrollment by Race and Class Status .......... 17 Appendix 3 NAFEO Inclusion Scholars Program Award Letter ................................................ 18 Appendix4 Table 6: MSU Fall 2010 Graduate Enrollment by Race and Classification Status ........ 20 Appendix 5 Cultural Diversity Assessment Plan ................................................................... 21 18 IP age 644Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan I 2011 State University Appendix 1 Table 1 MSU Fall 2010 Full-Time Faculty byRace, Tenure Status, and Rank African- Native American caucasian Asian American Rank Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Professor 23 7 3 2 2 1 4 2 Associate Professor 38 25 22 14 8 1 11 3 Assistant Professor 26 40 14 12 10 3 3 0 Instructor 2 2 1 0 0 1 0 1 Lecture r 73 54 28 13 7 2 2 4 Total (N = 464) 162 128 68 41 27 8 20 10 Percent of Total 35 28 15 9 6 2 4 2 Totals Female Males s 32 12 79 43 53 55 3 4 110 73 277 187 60 40 source: www.morgan.edu/Documents/ADMINISTRATION/Planning%20and%201nfo%20Tech/lnstitutionalResearch/Fall2010FacultyDemographics(1).pdf 19 IP age 645Strategic Plan for Enhancing Cultural Diversity at Morgan I 2011 State University Appendix2 Table 2 MSU Fall 2010 Undergraduate Enrollment by Race and Class Status African-American caucasian Asian Am Ind/Alaskan Multi-Race Female Status Male Female Male Female Male Female Male Female Males s First Time 421 455 1 2 17 64 23 48 28 29 Other First Year 264 311 1 6 2 2 3 0 15 15 Second Year 523 728 7 6 4 3 0 3 40 43 Third Year sos 707 12 7 5 4 0 0 57 59 Fourth Year & + 392 563 13 16 3 3 1 1 64 67 Unclassified 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 TOTAL FULL-TIME 2105 2766 34 37 31 76 27 52 204 213 Total Part Time 294 325 8 5 4 5 2 0 12 15 Totai Enrollment 2399 3091 42 42 35 81 29 52 216 228 source: www.morgan.edu/Documents/ADMINISTRATION/Planning%20and%201nfo%20Tech/lnstitutiona1Research/ Fall2010%20Undergraduate%20Enrollment%20by%20Program%20and%20Race(0).pdf Hispanic Unkn/Other Female Female Males s Males s TOTAL 16 30 43 48 1225 9 7 11 8 654 17 19 14 15 1422 17 21 16 15 1425 15 23 3 9 1173 0 0 0 0 2 74 100 87 95 5901 2 12 12 25 721 76 112 99 120 6622 20 IP age 646fiiNAF:O National Association For Equal Opportunity In Higher Education November 8, 2010 Denicia Fowler Retention Specialist/Coordinator Morgan State University Dear Ms. Fowler: On behalf of NAFEO and AT&T, I am pleased to inform you that Morgan State University has been selected to participate in the first phase of NAFEO's Inclusion Scholars Program-ISP (formerly known as the Inclusion in Higher Education Program-lHEP). We received over 20 applications from HBCUs for participation in this AT&T funded program. Following the review process, your institution was selected by NAFEO as a finalist, and will be able to offer one incoming freshman with disabilities a scholarship of $9,000 per year, for each of four years of their matriculation at your institution, for a total of $36,000 in scholarship assistance. Through AT&T's generous one-time contribution to NAFEO, we are able to provide this program over the next four years. NAFEO president Lezli Baskerville recently contacted the office of your president Dr. David Wilson via telephone to inform him of the scholarship award. As this is a new program, we want to work closely with your office to lay a strong foundation for the Inclusion Scholars Program. We hope that you or someone designated by you will be available to participate on periodic conference calls with the planning team, which is comprised of myself representing NAFEO; Kevin Parker and Jennifer Pyka representing AT&T; and disability consultants Carmen Jones and Alan Muir. The planning team will have a call on Thursday, November 11, 3PM EST. Please let me know if you are available to join the call on Thursday. We look forward to working with you to make this program a success and to continuing promoting inclusion on HBCU campuses.

This goes to the founding of St. Mary's College as a monument to the Freedom of Conscience that was devel oped at the English settlement that stood on the same grounds as the College. The genesis of the College's founding was to be a living monument to this unique idea. St. Mary's College has always been celebrated for its diverse and vibrant students and faculty. As a way to capture this tradition of celebrating the peculiar life at St. Mary's, the College processed the history and tradition into a document. Working together, the College community developed the St. Mary's Way. The St. Mary's Way is a communal pledge that all members of the College agree that they will join in the work to develop the College as a community. This pledge builds on the history and environment of the land and the responsibility of those associated with the College to be s tewards of both of these. In addition to the support of the history and the environment, College citizens pledge to \"engage in an ongoing dialogue that values differences and unique contributions of others' talent, backgrounds, customs, and worldviews.\" This line established the College's approach and base diversity definition. To operationalize the tenants of the St. Mary's Way, the College adopted the following language from the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) as its definit ion of diversity: \" Individual differences (e.g., personality, prior knowledge, and life experiences) and group/social differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, country of origin, and ability, as well as cultural, political, rel igious, or other affiliations) .\" This adoption of a common definition of diversity allows for all members of the College community to have the same understanding of this important issue. The College administration has taken the approach to incorporate equ ity and diversity into all of its planning and activities. Diversity was woven into each goal of the College's most recent strategic plan in 2016 and multiple metrics were established to assess progress in meeting these goals (see Appendix 1) . Due to COVID -19, the Colleg e continued with its existing strategic plan. The planning process for a new strategic plan is scheduled for the upcoming academic year with the goal of a new plan being in place for the 2022 -2023 academic year. 665Answer to Item 2: Six years ago, St. Mary's College of Maryland embarked on directly addressing the diversity, inclusion, and equity on campus with the creation of an ad hoc committee of students, faculty, and staff. Through the hard work of this group and the vision of Dr. Tuajua nda C. Jordan, President of St. Mary's College of Maryland, the Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity Office was created to address the issues associated with cultural diversity. However, this was just the beginning of the College's journey into this important work. Over the next several years, the operations were refined to address the complex nature of cultural diversity. In October 2020, the office was reorganized to address diversity with a cross -cutting approach. Through the last iteration of Inclusive Diversity and Equity (IDE), the Board of Trustees and President Jordan have already acted on our public responsibility to have a diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible community where all can flourish and succeed. We have not and will not shy away from diving into the campus thicket when these challenges and opportunities concerning diversity, equity, and inclusion -related issues arise. One of the hallmarks of this is recently dedicated Commemorative to the Enslaved Peoples of Southern Maryland. The physical celebration of perseverance is the first step toward changing the way that we discuss this stain on our collective history. The College is in the process of developing programming and curriculum around this magnificent piece. With this as the physical dedication to diversity, the next was to change the approach to how IDE work was done at the College. It is with that strong sense of community and resolve that the office steps into this new chapter as IDEAA: The Division of Inclusive Diversity , Equity, Access and Accountability. During President Jordan's State of the College remarks, she said, \"What we've learned over the years is that the job [Inclusive Diversity and Equity] is much too complex for a single individual to address with the sense of urgency we need.... SMCM needs a different approach - one that incorporates a number of individuals with different yet complementary areas of expertise and who are familiar with our College, to help build a solid foundation, from which to grow our IDE ef forts.\" To this end, President Jordan has tasked Michael Dunn, Assistant Vice President of Equity and Inclusion, Jos\u00e9 Ballesteros, Director of Equity Programming, and Kelsey Bush, Interim Chief Diversity Officer, to develop and implement the procedures, pr ograms and policies to move the initiatives of IDEAA forward while making us a community accountable for our efforts. As mentioned in the previous section, the College includes diversity in its strategic plan. In that plan, success is measured by the se veral metrics that are outlined in each section. A copy of this plan is included in the appendix. In addition to the measurements in the strategic plan, the unit monitors yearly retention numbers of faculty, staff, and students; follows persistence of students through graduation; uses survey data from multiple satisfaction and safety surveys; and works with different departments and student groups to identify areas of improvement and to collaborate on new initiatives to celebrate and highlight the diversi ty on campus. 666Answer to Item 3: As the world changed a year ago, St. Mary's College of Maryland shifted its toward the online platform to prevent the spread of COVID 19. The College's leadership led the campus on a shift toward a fully online experience for the remainder of the Spring 2 020 semester. Over the summer the first of many positives occurred. The first -year learning experience began with an overhaul of the summer orientation process, Seahawk Orientation Advising and Registration (SOAR). SOAR was moved to an online format and rechristened eSOAR to reflect the electronic format. The first part of eSOAR was the orientation leaders communicating with first - year students via web -based platforms. This created a sense of community early and alleviated the travel cost usually associ ated with this program. To augment this process, a weekly webinar series \"Hawk Talks\" was created in summer 2020, in which a featured office gave an overview of their campus role and answered questions from attendees. These practices have been adopted for the upcoming year as a way to allow all first -year families to receive information and participate in these important activities without barriers of travel or the associated costs. Leadership at the College understood that even with positive outcome s of an online learning environment, many students relied on the College for food, shelter, therapy, and other services. To address those needs, the College utilized the hybrid learning model to allow students that choose or needed to be on campus the opp ortunity to be here. They would have to adhere to strict guidelines but they would be able to have the support they needed without disruption. Currently, student success data for the entire 2020 -21 academic year is not yet available. However, based on mu ltiple student surveys administered during the Fall 2020 semester, both BIPOC and White students were adjusting fairly well to the altered academic experience (Appendix 2). Also, students indicated that they were satisfied with the processes and procedures that the College had in place with online learning. Many online programs were developed by Student Affairs to meet co -curricular needs of the campus. Additionally, many programs that have been or would have been in -person events became more impactful as online activities. Two examples of this were the dedication of the Commemorative to Enslaved Peoples of Southern Maryland and the Annual Martin Luther King Jr. Prayer Breakfast. Because both events live online, they can be used to celebrate diversity on campus beyond the day of the event. This allows for further discussion and reflection on the information presented during them. The pandemic has also led to the creation of new programming such as a film series celebrating diversity and a cross commu nity speaker series to discuss and bring the community closer together in light of all of the social and political events of the past year. The Bridging our Gaps program is a partnership between St. Mary's College of Mary's IDEAA unit, The Center for the Study of Democracy, and the College of Southern Maryland that provide an opportunity for the community at both institutions and the community at large to discuss several critical issues that affect our community. These topics ranged from election integrit y to race. 667Appendix 1 Cultural Diversity Plan St. Mary's College of Maryland Academic Year 2020 -2021 Inclusive Diversity at St. Mary's College of Maryland (SMCM) is a foundational tenet of the overall institutional mission. Our work is marked by our intention to \"foster... a community dedicated to honesty, civility, and integrity\" as stated in the SMCM mis sion statement. The Division of Inclusive Diversity and Equity (IDE) is committed to engaging the entire campus with a robust slate of activities aimed at program design, curriculum reform, alumni engagement, policy creation and general campus climate refo rm. Additionally, promoting and embracing cultural diversity and cultural competence among SMCM constituents is essential to the success of the institution as the nation's public honors college; hence, inclusion, diversity, equity, accountability and acces s are prominent themes that recur throughout the College's Strategic Plan. The IDE -related objectives in the Strategic Plan serve as the foundation of College's Cultural Diver sity Plan, which is as follows: Goal 1: Attract intellectually ambitious students who thrive in and respect a diverse, collaborative learning community. This will be partially accomplished through increasing diversity among the student body (Obje ctive 1); diversifying course offerings related to wellness, diversity, leadership, and financial literacy (Objective 2); and enhancing the academic and social integration of students in the campus environment (Objective 3). Goal 2: Engage studen ts in a rigorous, experiential, flexible, and innovative academic environment that capitalizes on our unique geographical location. This will be partially accomplished by promoting a community and academic environment that embodies the principles of divers ity and inclusion on which we were founded (Objective 4). In doing so, the campus will inventory its learning opportunities (via course offerings and workshop/training opportunities) for diversity -related content and pedagogical strategies as well as creat e a system for developing additional opportunities/offerings and a long -term plan for institution - wide IDE efforts. Goal 3: Attract and retain a diverse staff and faculty who achieve excellence across the liberal arts in the teaching, scholarsh ip, creative works, and practice of their disciplines. Toward this end, SMCM will increase its efforts to recruit/hire a diverse employee population (Objective 1) along with expanding efforts to create an inclusive environment that values and optimizes the strengths of a diverse workplace while supporting employees' professional excellence, personal well -being, and ability to thrive on campus (Objective 2). 668 Goal 4: Graduate prepared, responsible, and thoughtful global citizens. To accomplish this, SMCM will promote inclusion, diversity, and equity (via increased IDE initiatives and professional development opportunities) to engage students in (and assist employees in working with each other and students while) challenging and abating injustice cons istent with the St. Mary's Way (Objectives 3 and 4). Increase the four -year graduation rate for underrepresented (racial/ethnic minority and first-generation college) students. Note: Although this objective is not explicitly listed in the Strateg ic Plan, SMCM is committed to supporting efforts aimed at enhancing retention and graduation rates of these student populations. 669Appendix 2 Selected Student Survey Results Students were surveyed multiple times during Fall 2020 to check in on their experiences with remote or hybrid learning, and to assess their need for further support. Selected results are shown bel ow. In an early survey (September), students were asked \"Overall, how would you say this semester is going for you so far\"? Of 1,498 undergraduate students surveyed, 799 answered this question. Results shown below indicate a very similar pattern of respon ses between white students and BIPOC students. On a mid -semester (October) survey, students were asked to self -assess their academic performance in the Fall 2020 semester so far. Of 1,490 students surveyed, 787 answered this question. As seen below, a gain, BIPOC students showed a very similar pattern of responses to white students. 670 On that mid -semester survey, students were also asked about their satisfaction with various campus offices and services. Satisfaction results did not appear to vary ba sed on whether students were studying remotely, or were on campus, suggesting that campus offices were able to maintain their effectiveness while operating virtually. 671Cultural Diversity Plan St. Mary's College of Maryland Academic Year 2020 -2021 Inclusive Diversity at St. Mary's College of Maryland (SMCM) is a foundational tenet of the overall institutional mission. Our work is marked by our intention to \"foster... a community dedicated to honesty, civility, and integrity\" as stated in the SMCM mission statement. The Division of Inclusive Diversity and Equity (IDE) is committed to engaging the entire campus with a robust slate of activities aimed at program design, curriculum reform, alumni engagement, policy creation and general campus climate reform. Additionally, promoting and embracing cultural diversity and cultural competence among SMCM constituents is essential to the success of the institution as the nation's public honors college; hence, inclusion, diversity, equity, accountability and access are prominent themes that recur throughout the College's Strategic Plan. The IDE -related objectives in the Strategic Plan serve as the foundation of College's Cultural Diversity Plan, which is as follows: Goal 1: Attract intellectually ambitious students who thrive in and respect a diverse, collaborative learning community. This will b e partially accomplished through increasing diversity among the student body (Objective 1); diversifying course offerings related to wellness, diversity, leadership, and financial literacy (Objective 2); and enhancing the academic and social integration of students in the campus environment (Objective 3). Goal 2: Engage students in a rigorous, experiential, flexible, and innovative academic environment that capitalizes on our unique geographical location. This will be partially accomplished by promoting a community and academic environment that embodies the principles of diversity and inclusion on which we were founded (Objective 4). In doing so, the campus will inventory its learning opportunities (via course offerings and workshop/training opport unities) for diversity -related content and pedagogical strategies as well as create a system for developing additional opportunities/offerings and a long -term plan for institution- wide IDE efforts. Goal 3: Attract and retain a diverse staff and faculty who achieve excellence across the liberal arts in the teaching, scholarship, creative works, and practice of their disciplines. Toward this end, SMCM will increase its efforts to recruit/hire a diverse employee population (Objective 1) along with expanding efforts to create an inclusive environment that values and optimizes the strengths of a diverse workplace while supporting employees' professional excellence, personal well -being, and ability to thrive on campus (Objective 2). Goal 4: Graduate prepared, responsible, and thoughtful global citizens. To accomplish this, SMCM will promote inclusion, diversity, and equity (via increased IDE initiatives and professional development opportunities) to engage students in (and assist employees in 672working with each other and students while) challenging and abating injustice consistent with the St. Mary's Way (Objectives 3 and 4). Increase the four -year graduation rate for underrepresented (racial/ethnic minority and first-generation college) students. Note: Although this objective is not explicitly listed in the Strategic Plan, SMCM is committed to supporting efforts aimed at enhancing retention and graduation rates of these student populations. 6731The Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion ReportMaryland Independent College and University Association MICUA Capitol Technology University Goucher College Hood College Johns Hopkins University Loyola University Maryland Maryland Institute College of Art McDaniel College Mount St. Mary's University Notre Dame of Maryland University St. John's College Stevenson University Washington Adventist University Washington College 2021 6742About MICUA THE MARYLAND INDEPENDENT COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY ASSOCIATION is a member-driven organization devoted to serving the interests of independent higher education and supporting the work of campus leaders throughout the State. Established in 1971, the Association provides services to meet the needs of independent higher education and fosters cooperative efforts among its member institutions and all segments of higher education. As the voice of independent higher education in Maryland, MICUA seeks to inform the broader public about its member institutions and the vital importance of independent colleges and universities to the future of our State and nation. The State of Maryland has maintained a partnership with its independent colleges and universities for 239 years, beginning with the charters granted to Washington College in 1782 and St. John's College in 1784. The first State operating grant for higher education was awarded to Washington College in 1782. For more than two centuries, the State has provided line-item appropriations for land, campus buildings, operating expenses, and equipment. Today, the primary State support for independent higher education is through the Joseph A. Sellinger Aid Program, which was established in 1973. A diverse and distinctive group of 13 State-aided institutions constitutes MICUA's membership. These public-purpose institutions offer students a broad spectrum of educational opportunities. Some common features stand out. From the smallest to the largest, Maryland's independent colleges and universities offer an education characterized by small classes and close interaction between skilled faculty and motivated students. Every MICUA institution offers quality undergraduate education to a diverse student body, and increasingly institutions are expanding programs of graduate and continuing study to meet ongoing needs for lifelong learning. Sara Fidler PresidentIrnande AltemaAssociate Vice President for Government and Business Affairs Cover photo: Johns Hopkins University Angela Sherman Vice President for Academic Affairs 6753THE MARYLAND GENERAL ASSEMBLY passed legislation in 2008 that requires each independent institution that receives State Sellinger funds to report annually to MICUA on programs and practices that promote and enhance cultural diversity. As defined in statute, \"cultural diversity\" means the inclusion of those racial and ethnic groups that traditionally have been underrepresented in higher education. In consultation with its member institutions, MICUA developed a survey instrument for independent colleges and universities to report annually on their cultural diversity programs and practices. MICUA is charged with compiling the information received from its member institutions and submitting a report to the Maryland Higher Education Commission (MHEC). For the past 13 years, MICUA has surveyed Maryland's independent colleges and universities to identify new and ongoing programs and activities that promote cultural understanding, build on impactful policies, and create a blueprint for success in fostering inclusive campus communities. With information collected from these surveys, MICUA publishes an annual Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report. MICUA's 2021 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Report is a compilation of the results of its most recent survey. The Report does not list every initiative or effort on each campus, but provides a general overview of common activities, unique programs, and best practices to enhance the campus climate and support cultural competency. Many of the examples provided in the Report are ongoing, multi-year practices and programs that have proven effective. Other examples reflect new and emerging initiatives over the past year as campuses have responded to racial injustice, violence and brutality, and social disparities further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Report also highlights meetings, lectures, discussions, ad hoc events, and other activities held to promote learning about and continued discussions of race, gender, and equity. MICUA's Commitment to Diversity St. John's College 6764MICUA MEMBER INSTITUTIONS SERVE nearly 55,000 students every year. The student population is racially diverse, economically diverse, and demographically diverse in other ways, including adult learners and non-traditional students, students who speak English as a second language, students who are first to go to college in their families, and transfer students from community colleges. While the overall tuition of an independent college or university is often higher than that of a public college or university, private colleges work hard to meet the financial needs of their admitted students, often resulting in lower \"out of pocket\" expenses for families. Almost 90 percent of full-time undergraduate students at MICUA colleges and universities receive one or more types of financial aid to make their enrollment possible.Enrolling Diverse Students Combining State and federal scholarships and grant programs, low-interest loans, institutional aid, private scholarships, and on-campus employment gives most students with financial need the necessary resources to enroll at their top choice institution. Attending a Maryland independent college or university is possible for students from all economic circumstances. MICUA member institutions target financial aid to students with the greatest need. In fiscal year 2020, MICUA institutions granted $285 million in institutional-based aid to Maryland students. Eighty-five to ninety percent of State Sellinger funding, or $51 million, was used directly for financial aid for Maryland students, with the remaining funds used for innovative academic programs and support services that promote student access and success. Pell Grant Recipients (low-income) 23% 77%One in four undergraduate students enrolled at a MICUA institution is economically disadvantaged. Notre Dame of Maryland University Pell Recipients Source: IPEDS Unit Data 2021.FY 2020 Sources of Undergraduate Student Financial Aid at MICUA Institutions Source: FAIS 2018 2019 Segment Data. 6775ALL INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION are required to report enrollment and graduation rates through the federal Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS). The figures for students are disaggregated by race and ethnicity. Based on 2020 IPEDS enrollment data, 34 percent of undergraduate students enrolled at MICUA member institutions are underrepresented minority students. Between fall 2010 and fall 2020, there was an 89 percent increase in the enrollment of these students. Institutions also report the race and ethnicity of full-time faculty. Based on the most recent IPEDS data available, 28 percent of full-time faculty at MICUA institutions are faculty of color. Four MICUA member institutions are majority minority institutions, while 11 MICUA member institutions enjoy undergraduate minority representation of 30 percent or more. MICUA Diversity at a Glance 89% Increase in Undergraduate Underrepresented Minority Students Since 2010 Source: NCES-IPEDSUnderrepresented Minority Students McDaniel College 6786Mission Statements MICUA MEMBER INSTITUTIONS are committed to providing an inclusive community. The belief that diversity is essential to a quality education is affirmed in institutional mission statements, values statements, and diversity statements. Goucher College's Mission Statement, Diversity Statement, and Community Principles affirm that diversity and racial equity are central to a liberal arts education and to the institution's core values. The College's Diversity Statement follows: \"We at Goucher College are dedicated to social justice, diversity, and equity and inclusion as fundamental components of our mission and ethos. We champion an inclusive community, embrace and respect different perspectives, and value diversity in all its forms and intersections, including ability, age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, nationality, race, religious and spiritual belief, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. Understanding that power, privilege, and other forces of inequality play a role in shaping our individual and collective experiences and identities, we are committed to productive dialogue and meaningful action in addressing our differences. We approach this ongoing work with courage, integrity, care, and respect.\" Founded as one of the nation's first independent, coeducational institutions of higher learning, McDaniel College's evolution is characterized by academic excellence, extraordinary administrative and faculty dedication and resourcefulness, and increasing student selectivity and diversity. This past year McDaniel has made a conscious effort to strengthen its commitment to equity and inclusion by creating and implementing a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Statement. An excerpt from this Statement follows: \"We are a community dedicated to excellence in the liberal arts, and as such, we welcome the contributions of divergent perspectives and experiences that strengthen the educational experience. Our community is fully committed to breaking down the walls of division, rejecting acts of exclusion, and challenging injustice, prejudice, and ethnocentrism. We seek to promote the presence and expressions of all groups, including those historically and/or currently marginalized.\" St. John's College's Diversity Statement, adopted in 2007 and later revised, is included in the Statement of St. John's Program of Instruction: \"The aim of the education offered by St. John's College is the liberation of the human intellect. This is an education for all, regardless of a person's race, ethnicity, sex, religious beliefs, country of origin, economic background, age, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. By reading great books and struggling together with the fundamental questions that they raise, students and their teachers learn from their differences and discover more deeply their shared humanity. In this and other ways, a diversity of background and experience enriches our community of learning. Because it offers an education for all, St. John's College has sought and continues to seek to make its program of study known and available to people of diverse backgrounds.\" Washington College's Mission Statement reflects commitment to challenging and inspiring \"emerging citizen leaders to discover lives of purpose and passion.\" The College values a campus culture that welcomes diversity in thought, identity, and opportunity. In alignment with the College's mission, a new Diversity Statement was written in May 2019. An excerpt from this Statement follows: \"In the pursuit of academic excellence, we endeavor to be a community made up of people from a variety of backgrounds with differing perspectives, life experiences, religious, philosophical and political beliefs, lifestyles, and ideologies. We pledge to create a respectful and supportive environment for collaboration, empathy, and the building of meaningful relationships among members of Washington College. We commit to fostering a more equitable, inclusive, and engaged community that embraces all the complexity that each person brings to campus.\" 6797Strategic Plans & Goals MICUA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES RECOGNIZE diversity as a goal in their long-range strategic plans to create inclusive and welcoming environments, increase engagement, sponsor cultural activities, and foster inclusive communities. In 2016, Johns Hopkins University published the \"Roadmap on Diversity and Inclusion,\" a university-wide effort that highlighted the ways in which diversity of people, thought, and experiences is essential to the University's mission and long-term success. Annual reports provide a transparent accounting of progress; the most recent was published in Summer 2020. While the University recognizes that it has much more work to do, it is proud of the measured progress it has made, such as increasing the diversity of faculty, students, and staff; broadening the support and networks available to mentor faculty, graduate students, and diverse cohorts of undergraduate students; and increasing training related to unconscious bias, sexual assault, and other key issues. Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) has been involved in an institutional strategic planning process since 2015. In 2018, a Presidential Task Force issued a final report to investigate meaningful ways to integrate diversity, equity, and inclusion across the campus. This step is part of the vision for MICA to thrive with Baltimore, model a community of care, embrace difference, and champion equity. In 2019, the goals set in the Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, Globalization (DEIG) Workplan were underway; however, although the COVID-19 public health emergency continues to halt action on the strategic plan, MICA has still made strides.In 2019-2020, Notre Dame of Maryland University underwent a comprehensive yearlong process to develop the University's new five-year strategic plan, \"Going Beyond: Vision 2025.\" The University has identified five goals and three themes of diversity and inclusion, service and social responsibility, and a local to global perspective to guide and advance the institution. As a part of its first goal, the University established a sub-goal to \"cultivate a culture of diversity and inclusion.\" This sub-goal reinforces the University's commitment to building inclusive communities through programs and training focused on implicit bias and anti-racism; opportunities for discussion on issues related to race, diversity, and inclusion; reactivation of the University's Diversity and Inclusion Committee; faculty professional development; and recruitment and retention of a diverse faculty and staff. In Washington Adventist University's \"Vision 2030: Distinctive Excellence in Student Success\" strategic plan, diversity remains an important focus. The University has prioritized diversity in the \"People\" pillar of its plan to \"intentionally embrace diversity and intercultural understanding\" and create \"invigorating programs that cultivate diversity, celebrating the variety of cultures, preferences, and backgrounds represented at WAU.\" The University has received external recognition for these commitments, having been ranked #1 Most Diverse School in Maryland, #50 Most Diverse Colleges in America (Niche, 2020); #1 Association of Independent Institutions (AII) Ethnic Diversity (College Raptor, 2020); and #35 Top Colleges & Universities for Racial & Cultural Diversity-Nationally (Study.com, 2019).Mount St. Mary's University 6808OFFICES OF DIVERSITY and multicultural affairs demonstrate MICUA members' commitment to enhancing cultural diversity. Many institutions have created councils, committees, and workgroups to complement this work. They have also developed collaborative initiatives to foster inclusivity and hired staff to coordinate and oversee the range of programs and issues related to diversity. Hood College's Office of Diversity and Inclusion supports diverse student organizations, creates retention initiatives for students from underrepresented populations, and coordinates campus programming around diversity, equity, and inclusion. In December 2020, a new senior leadership position, Vice President of Community and Inclusivity, was created. The primary role is to ensure the well-being of every member of the Hood community and to build a healthy, safe, empowering and inclusive campus environment. In 2020-2021, the College's diversity, equity, and inclusion training sessions addressed topics such as racial inequities rooted in the electoral college; black women political activism; best practices for a trans-inclusive campus; support for military students; discussions on anti-Asian hate incidents; conversations about race, inclusion, intersectionality, diversity, and equity; and race caf\u00e9s for faculty, staff, and students. In prior years, topics have included mentoring students of color; creating a culturally relevant bystander intervention curriculum; overcoming unconscious bias and racial tensions; and bridging the gap between Islam, Islamophobia, and contemplative pedagogy. In January 2020, Loyola University Maryland hired a Chief Equity and Inclusion Officer and established the Office of Equity and Inclusion. The office uses an integrative approach that recognizes the strength of embedded partnerships for diversity, equity, and inclusion that span across the University. The President's Council for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion along with students and alumni boards support and monitor university-wide initiatives and the strategic plan for diversity, equity, and inclusion. In 2020-2021, special campus initiatives and working groups included: Karson Institute on Race, Peace, and Social Justice; Transgender Inclusion Working Group; ADA Compliance Team; and Voices on Equity, in which faculty and other community leaders led summer webinars on various topics of diversity, equity, inclusion, and antiracism.At Mount St. Mary's University, the chief diversity officer, Vice President for Equity and Success, is a cabinet-level position. This role oversees the Center for Student Engagement and Success. The Center for Student Diversity fosters inclusion, collaboration, and relationship-building across campus. The Center provides academic, social, and transitional support in addition to programming, leadership training, and inclusive workshops for all students. In Spring 2020, the President created a university-wide Task Force to develop a framework for a holistic review to address racism on campus and in the community. This framework consists of 10 initiatives: professional development, prevention of and responses to incidents of racism on campus, campus climate, physical display of diverse human experiences, diversifying the curriculum, dealing with trauma and healing from racism, institutional racism, workforce diversity, community partnerships, and data analysis. Specific outcomes and workgroups with members from across campus were identified for each initiative. Leadership to Foster Diversity Loyola University Maryland 6819Stevenson University's Center for Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) conducts workshops, retreats, presentations, and seminars to develop awareness of other cultures and beliefs; advises student groups that have a diversity focused mission; creates events that highlight the University's commitment to diversity and inclusion; and sponsors events that commemorate religious, spiritual, and national observances. The University's Diversity and Inclusion Committee, a group of presidentially appointed faculty and staff members, is made up of four sub-committees: programming and events, training and professional development, marketing and communication, and assessment. The Committee's leadership team, called the \"working group,\" includes the Vice President for Human Resources, Vice President for Student Affairs, Director of Diversity and Inclusion, Director of Talent Management, and Chair of Business Communications. In January 2021, Notre Dame of Maryland University launched a revitalized Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee led by the Associate Dean of Inclusion and Community Standards and a faculty co-chair. The committee consists of four faculty, the Director for Human Resources, Director for Accessibility and Health Promotion, Director of Athletics, Director of Institutional Research, Chief of Staff, and the Associate Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students. The Committee is responsible for providing coordination of diversity, equity, and inclusion related strategic, policy, and operational objectives; facilitating collaboration, feedback, and communication on University DEI initiatives; and identifying and recommending best practices and metrics to enhance DEI and anti-racism activities at NDMU. The Committee began planning in spring 2021 with several initiatives to be launched in the 2021-22 academic year.Hood College 68210CROSS-CULTURAL COMPONENTS are included in MICUA members' general education requirements, which students satisfy by taking courses in areas such as ethnic studies, non-western civilizations, foreign languages, diversity, and inclusion. Described below are a few examples of courses and programs that promote diversity. One of Capitol Technology University's assessment principles is that \"graduates will be able to demonstrate an understanding of different cultures and values.\" Cultural diversity is incorporated in some of the curriculum, i.e., the business department embeds cultural diversity in their program and classroom instruction through a global lens. Where appropriate, case studies are discussed to examine the issues associated with a lack of cultural diversity. Course materials further facilitate the dialogue around multicultural affairs and around improving the diversity in technical fields. At Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), cultural literacy is woven into the undergraduate and graduate programs and is an especially pronounced aspect of MICA's liberal arts offerings. In response to student demands to decolonize the course materials and teaching strategies, various departments at MICA shifted beyond cultural literacy to a complete redesign. For example, \"UNMAKING RACISM\" is a new academic program designed to deliver on MICA's commitment to \"transcend its racist past,\" to \"make fundamental change,\" and contribute to MICA's goal of being a worthy destination for all students, staff, and faculty by \"diversifying academics\" (MICA DEIG Action Plan, 2020). Moreover, as part of its institution-wide strategic plan, MICA launched The Space for Creative Black Imagination, an interdisciplinary Making and Research institute. The institute is the first of its kind to be established and hosted by an art and design college, and builds on MICA's legacy as the first independent, continuously degree granting college of art and design. McDaniel College's general education requirements are part of the \"McDaniel Plan.\" This curriculum represents the College's commitment to integrated studies in the liberal arts. \"Global Citizenship\" is a required area of study, designed to help students obtain an understanding of the world within and beyond the U.S. to develop into critical, sensitive, respectful, and compassionate global citizens. To fulfill this requirement, students must take one course with a multicultural focus and two courses with an international or cross-cultural focus. The College also offers the \"Global Fellows Program,\" a curricular/co-curricular program for students from all academic programs designed to deepen and broaden their understanding of global issues and cultivate the skills necessary to lead successful lives in a global context. With a strong emphasis on intercultural competency, students are required to study abroad and attend workshops each semester for three years. As espoused in Notre Dame of Maryland University's (NDMU) mission statement and general education learning outcomes, one of the general education goals for NDMU is \"Development of a Global Perspective.\" As part of the current general education requirements, at least one course must be focused on gender studies and one on cross-cultural studies. The Curriculum and Academic Policy Committee and faculty revised the general education requirements to further incorporate diversity education. The forthcoming curriculum has a nine-credit \"Understanding and Valuing Diverse Identities and Perspectives\" requirement and is expected to launch during the 2021-2022 academic year. In addition to the formal curriculum, students engage in service to their local communities as part of their educational experience. Beginning with NDMU100 (freshmen orientation course), to the University's Bonner Leaders program, to individual majors and classes, cultural literacy through service is ingrained throughout the educational experience. Washington College believes that global education is necessary to prepare citizen-leaders in the 21st century. All students are required to take one to two foreign language courses. In addition to basic language instruction, courses introduce students to the literature, customs, music, art, religion, history, and politics of the countries and regions where the language is spoken. Further, many disciplines and interdisciplinary fields of inquiry offered as majors and minors at the College focus on social forces that maintain structures of entrenched power and dominance: Sociology (e.g., courses related to social stratification); Political Science and International Studies (e.g., courses that cultivate understanding of power structures across the globe); Philosophy and Religion (e.g., courses that extend beyond the Western philosophical canon and beyond the Christian experience); Black Studies; and Gender Studies. Inclusion of Cultural Diversity in the Curriculum 68311MICUA MEMBER INSTITUTIONS TAKE ACTIVE measures to create a welcoming environment for students both inside and outside of the classroom. Student organizations, activities, lectures, and campus events are an important part of these efforts to make students from all backgrounds feel welcome while exposing students to different perspectives. Hood College actively encourages culturally enriching experiences for all students. Diversity programs, including student organization dialogues, Race Caf\u00e9s, and presentations promote cross-cultural collaboration and increase understanding among student organizations and the campus community. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion works closely with the Office of Student Engagement and Orientation and the Residence Life Office to support programs and activities sponsored by the Diversity Coalition and other student organizations such as All About Modeling and Etiquette, Hillel/Jewish Student Union, Muslim Student Association, and the Global Citizens Club, plus the Military Student Committee and Delta Lambda Pi (students with disabilities honor society). Other celebrations include Holidays Around the World, which showcases foods and activities from various locations; the Diversity Block Party, which highlights activities and foods from multiple cultural populations; and the Diversity Leadership Recognition Ceremony, which recognizes student leaders from all underrepresented populations. Every year, Loyola University Maryland invites the campus and Baltimore community to launch the spring semester with the Martin Luther King, Jr. Convocation, which features a speaker providing meaningful inquiry into race and legacies of racism in America. In 2021, the annual MLK Convocation featured Dr. Ibram Kendi, noted author and scholar. The lecture was attended by well over 1,000 students, staff, faculty, and members of the Baltimore community. While many programs and events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and shift of Loyola's instructional program to an online format, key efforts over the past year included: Racial Justice Training, Common Text Panel, Ignatian Family Teach-In, Messina Anti-Racism Program, Speak-Up! To Microaggressions, Disability Justice in Action, Diversity Reading Groups, and the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Action Steps Website.Activities & Organizations Goucher College 68412Maryland Institute College of Art At Notre Dame of Maryland University, all Student Government Association organizations are required to hold at least three events each semester, with one being of service to either the Notre Dame community or the community beyond campus. In 2019-20, the University launched its IMPRINT program as its distinctive Women's College experience - that prepares students to lead in all aspects of their life. One of the four pillars of IMPRINT focuses on Global Understanding; Diversity and Inclusion: Adopt a global mindset, develop a deeper appreciation for the value of diversity, and learn how to build inclusive communities. Successful women leaders understand and value diversity through adopting a global mindset. IMPRINT emphasizes the global experience as an integral part of women's education for recognizing perspectives other than one's own, communicating across different cultures, and taking action based on global knowledge. Further, Housing and Residence Life continued to offer a number of programs focusing on community citizenship and multi-racial/cultural awareness, including a natural hair party, living in dual cultures, Muslim Student Association interactive lecture and discussion, intersectionality & perfectionism, Latin Dance night, and Zuzu acrobats. Johns Hopkins University's Office of Diversity and Inclusion provided central support for JHU divisions around the inequitable impact of COVID-19 and targeted racial and ethnic violence impacting our communities. Key activities of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion included: participating in COVID-19 response planning; advising on DEI implications of institutional decision-making; hosting the first in JHU's Bearing Witness series, Addressing Hate During COVID-19, the largest DEI related event at JHU to date, with more than 630 faculty, staff, students, alumni, and Baltimore community neighbors participating; partnering with Johns Hopkins Medicine (JHM) for the Journeys in Healing town hall series in response to the Black Lives Matter movement; and providing training and technical support to divisions, units, and programs seeking to increase their capacity around DEI issues. 68513The contributions of Stevenson University's students, faculty, and staff, and some of the region's best-known artists, entertainers, and speakers, enhance campus life in the areas of diversity, inclusion, multiculturalism, cultural competency, and equity. Events were hosted in collaboration with student groups to celebrate National Women's History Month, National Hispanic Heritage Month, Black History Month, and Asian American Pacific Islander Month. A monthly \"Open Mic Coffee House\" allowed students to showcase their diverse talents during awareness and celebration months. For example, this past year Student Activities hosted an event during Women's History Month that highlighted women students on campus who are business owners. This very successful event allowed these businesswomen to showcase their products. The Association of Black Psychologists is a recently formed group on campus that hosts events and talks to focus on mental health in the black community. Sister-to-Sister programs, Coffee House series, and Friday Night Flicks programs continued this year, offering space for dialogue about issues of race and ethnicity and introducing students to films that deal with issues of identity. While shifting to remote instruction in Fall 2020 posed challenges to cultural programming, St. John's College has been able to offer many of its activities online. St. John's has a new student group, Johnnies of Color, with members from both the Annapolis and Santa Fe campuses. Students participated in a dinner that invited international students to cook food from their home countries. The College has a tutor-led study group dedicated to studying works from the tradition of African American thought and music. Ongoing student clubs and activities include Pangaea (international student club), Black Student Union Pink Triangle Society (LGBTQIT alliance on campus), Spanish poetry/literature club, and student groups to study, practice, and explore various religions. At Washington Adventist University , the University Student Unions (clubs representing ethnic backgrounds, countries, and cultures) plan and implement cultural awareness programs every semester, in collaboration with the Director of International Student Programs, Vice President for Student Life, and Vice President for Ministry. Activities recognizing and celebrating diverse populations include: Student Union days showcasing cultures through displays, music, and food; International Day celebrating the diversity of Latin culture; diversity experiences and education during missions week, including a cultural focused convocation; various music styles in Campus Ministry programs and services including gospel, classical, jazz, and dance; specific cultural foods in the dining hall; and cultural nights, fashion shows, and a myriad of other social activities. Additional plans for 2020-2021 included a campus wide event featuring diverse cultures, with a special focus on celebrating similarities and common ground with the new Saudi Student Union, leading in integration and understanding of Muslim culture on campus. Recently, the University created the Drum Major for Justice Award, which recognizes an individual who has an exemplary record for social justice activism. The inaugural recipient was named during the Martin Luther King, Jr. Birthday Commemoration on January 18, 2021. Johns Hopkins University 68614Publications & Promotional Materials MICUA MEMBER INSTITUTIONS utilize print publications and electronic materials to reach students, prospective students, faculty and staff, and the community. To create a welcoming environment and encourage respect for diversity, MICUA schools ensure that all publications, promotional materials, and websites reflect diverse populations that span ethnicity, race, national origin, age, and gender groups. At Capitol Technology University , students of color make up over 48% of undergraduate students. The marketing and communications department works to ensure that the University's print and electronic promotional materials reflect the diversity of the student population. As part of its inclusion strategies, Capitol Tech publishes blog posts on its website and in social media highlighting accomplished individuals. During Black History Month in February, the University published 13 blog posts about Black scientists. During Women's History Month in March, the University produced nine blog posts about women trailblazers in the STEM fields. During Pride Month in June, Capitol Tech featured a spotlight on English mathematician Alan Turing, a pioneer in the fields of computer science, cryptanalysis, and artificial intelligence. Turing's codebreaking work\u2014including the previously unbreakable Enigma code used by the German armed forces\u2014was crucial to the Allied forces victory in World War II. The Office of Communications strives to represent Goucher College's diverse student body in all its print and electronic publications and on its website. Goucher ensures that the College's series of student, faculty, and alumni profiles online and in print reflects the rich diversity in the community in terms of academic and extracurricular interests, ethnicity, gender, and geography. The \"Experience Goucher\" section of the website includes a page titled \"Equity & Identity at Goucher\" that emphasizes the College's commitment to diversity while also providing information and resources to prospective students. A section of Goucher's student life website contains information and resources designed to demonstrate Goucher's commitment to diversity and to help answer questions. From there, links can be found to the Maryland Scholars Program; International Student Support; President's Council for Race Equity; Cultural Programming; and the Center for Race, Equity, and Identity. Stevenson University 68715St. John's College McDaniel College ensures that all printed communications depict persons from diverse backgrounds in words and images. The College's online newsletter, News@McDaniel, features stories on all aspects of diversity including invited speakers, international students, and coverage of events by campus organizations such as Africa's Legacy, Black Student Union, Hispano-Latinx Alliance, Asian Community Coalition, Jewish Student Union, Gender and Sexuality Alliance, Belly Dancing Club, and more. This past year, McDaniel highlighted several students, staff, faculty, and alumni from diverse backgrounds for their accomplishments: the virtual senior capstone exhibition showcased the work of five art students; two outstanding members of the Class of 2021 were recognized during a virtual senior awards ceremony for activity and leadership awards; a senior was honored with the Arthur Ashe Jr. Sports Scholar Award; and McDaniel-College Bound Scholarships were awarded to five Baltimore City high school seniors. 68816Recruitment, College Preparation, Intervention, & Community Outreach MICUA MEMBERS TAKE ACTION during each aspect of the application and admissions process to provide students from all backgrounds the opportunity to attend and succeed at an inclusive institution of higher education. Capitol Technology University was a founding member of First Generation College Bound (FGCB). FGCB's mission is to empower youth from low to moderate income families to achieve social and economic success by providing guidance, encouragement, and support in earning a college degree. Capitol maintains active ties with CollegeBound Foundation, which works in Baltimore City to encourage and enable students to pursue postsecondary education. Capitol holds an annual STEM career expo for high school juniors, which provides opportunities to experience hands-on STEM experiments and learn about careers in STEM fields. Capitol partners with Black Girls Code (BGC) and over the past year provided Cyber Saturday activities to over 150 members of BGC. The components of Goucher College's cultural diversity recruitment plan include in-person and virtual student recruitment in 30 states, Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and internationally. Goucher's Maryland Scholars Program is a four-year academic and financial support program for college-bound Maryland residents who have been awarded the Howard P . Rawlings Guaranteed Access Grant. The Goucher Summer Academy, a two-week residential pre-orientation for Maryland Scholars, is expected to launch for the incoming fall 2021 class. The Goucher Prison Education Partnership (GPEP) extends post-secondary learning to two additional locations of the College within the state prison system. GPEP relies on strong partnerships cultivated with students, the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS), and several other partners to build on its longstanding commitment to attract, support, and educate talented students, regardless of need or background, eager to obtain a liberal arts education.McDaniel College 68917At Notre Dame of Maryland University , the admission/ recruitment staffs for all divisions are ethnically diverse. The undergraduate Women's College specifically recruits at majority minority high schools, especially in the Baltimore City region. The University's efforts to recruit a diverse population have been successful. In 2020-2021, the Women's College population identified as 55% minority; 35% first generation; and 55% Pell eligible. The University's Trailblazers Program is designed to support first generation college students via personalized meetings to assess student needs, workshops, collaborations with campus departments/services, and guest speakers. The Trailblazers program has a new initiative, Primeras, whose mission is to assist first generation Latina students as they navigate the academic journey at Notre Dame. St. John's College is committed to diversity in the recruitment process, including fly-in programs and special tours. The College offers a need-based financial aid program that enables students from all income levels to attend. St. John's has developed and initiated a Pell Bridge program to help support incoming Pell-eligible first-year students. In Fall 2021, the College will introduce its Pritzker pre-orientation program for first-year students from historically underrepresented groups to help them adjust to the college experience. The College emphasizes diversity in its Summer Academy, an annual on-campus summer college experience for high school students. There is also an emphasis on diversity in orientation seminars for first-year students, including topics such as Women in Homer and Frederick Douglass's \"The Nature of Slavery.\" The College is conducting a historical study of the relationships between St. John's College and African Americans in Annapolis, especially regarding enslaved peoples.

In testament to this cause, each college and university has put programs and offices in place to assist students in the transition to college life through graduation. At Hood College, all new first-year and transfer students participate in a mandatory diversity program during new student orientation. This three-hour interactive program informs, empowers, and challenges participants to explore cultural norms and unintended biases, and helps create community standards for the upcoming academic year. The College's Student Success Center evaluates all incoming students for academic skills. Students who need additional support are encouraged to enroll in an elective, two-credit GNST 101: Seminar for Academic Success. Student Success Peer Mentors are assigned to new students enrolled in GNST 101 and they co-teach the class and provide additional out-of-class engagement. Hood's First-Year Seminar, FYS 101, offers students an opportunity to sharpen reading, writing, and presentation skills in a small class setting. Seminar topics are designed to have broad appeal to students while reflecting the varied interests and expertise of the faculty who teach the topics. First-year students are advised by their FYS 101 instructor, ensuring they have at least twice-weekly contact during the critical initial adjustment and major decision-making period. Loyola University Maryland offers a range of curricular and co- curricular programs that support student success, including the Multicultural Awareness Program and African, Latinx, Asian, and Native American (ALANA) Services' pre-fall program that is designed to assist first-year students acclimate to campus life at Loyola. Specific aims of the program are academic enhancement, intercultural exploration, social adjustment, and community service. The ALANA Mentoring Program pairs first-year ALANA students with upper-class students to assist them with acclimating to campus life and achieving academic and personal growth. The Ignatius Scholars Program is designed to assist in the academic and social transition for 30 first-year students who identify as first-generation college students, demonstrate significant financial need, or come from diverse backgrounds. MAN2MAN & Sister to Sister are two gender-based racial identity groups coordinated through ALANA Services. These groups encourage the exploration and discussion of the intersectionality of gender and race/ethnicity on a predominantly White institution's campus through wellness workshops, discussion circles, informal mentoring, and academic challenges. 69119St. John's CollegeAt Mount St. Mary's University , the Mount Cares Committee represents every professional segment of the campus community (Academic Affairs, Residence Life, Public Safety, Campus Ministry, Center for Student Diversity, Center for Student Engagement and Success, and Learning Services). This group meets on a bi-weekly basis to review and discuss students identified as at-risk by professors or other staff members. Every student is assigned a contact person from the Committee, who offers resources and support where needed. In September 2019, the Center for Student Engagement and Success hired a Third Century Scholars Student Success Coach. This professional staff member: advises, mentors, and advocates for the needs of minority students enrolled in the Scholars programs, including St. Labre Native Scholars and Milton Hershey Scholars; teaches one of the University's First Year Symposium courses; and provides opportunities to expand the scholars' involvement on campus and enhance their academic and social well-being. The Mount hired a new Assistant Dean and Director of New Student Programs who works closely with the Center for Student Engagement and Success (to develop first-year student programs) and is responsible for organizing freshman and transfer orientation, as well as first-generation programs. Washington College utilizes CARE, an online case management system that allows faculty, staff, and students to instantly report student well-being concerns. Reports are reviewed daily by the Dean of Students Office, and bi-monthly, a cross-campus team reviews student cases to determine appropriate follow-up and support. Students may also use CARE to report bias incidents. The First-Year Career Awareness Program provides guidance and information to assist students in making important career and educational decisions. The First-Year Seminar Program introduces students to the excitement of critical inquiry and learning, and to key academic skills required for success. The Office of Academic Skills offers peer tutoring, course mentoring, individual academic support, and seminars on a range of topics including time management, procrastination, test taking strategies, note taking strategies, study habits, learning styles, and goal setting. The Office also supports students who are struggling academically through the Academic Recovery Program, which involves weekly meetings with mentors, study hall sessions and success seminars, and on-campus supports such as tutoring. St. John's College 69220 IN 2016 LEADERS OF THE 13 MICUA MEMBER INSTITUTIONS announced the launch of the Guaranteed Access Partnership Program (GAPP). This first-of-its-kind program was created to reduce college costs and moderate student debt for Maryland high school students who lack the financial resources to afford higher education. Students who receive a State Guaranteed Access grant and a GAPP grant may receive up to $38,800 each year for four years. MICUA member institutions also offer individual need- and merit-based grants and scholarships to promote diversity. Capitol Technology University has a commitment to providing access to underserved students. Capitol makes full tuition scholarships available for high ability students who demonstrate financial need. Other high need students can qualify for institutional grant funds from $2,000-$12,000. Capitol also offers an annual $5,000 scholarship, renewable for a maximum of $20,000, to a high school senior who participated in the Future Kings STEM after school program. Capitol offers a $2,000 annually renewable scholarship to Chesapeake Math and IT high school graduates. This school, located in Prince George's County, has a total minority student enrollment of 95% and low-income student enrollment of 33%. In addition, based on donor specifications, Capitol awards scholarship funds in cybersecurity specifically for Baltimore City students, Prince George's County students, and women. At Johns Hopkins University , an extraordinary $1.8 billion gift from alumnus and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2019 had an immediate effect on undergraduate admissions and supports for first-generation and low-income students. Over the past decade, the University had already seen a dramatic upward trajectory in the diversity of the incoming freshman class. The University's ability to announce permanently need-blind admissions while meeting full demonstrated need and eliminating federal loans led to an unprecedented one-year jump in the number of Pell-eligible students, from 15.4% to 19.1% for the class entering in Fall 2019. At the same time, the percentage of undergraduate students on the Homewood campus identifying as underrepresented minorities increased in one year from 25.0% to 27.4%, and those who were among the first generation in their families to attend college increased from 11.9% to 15.1%. Maryland Institute College of Art's (MICA) renewable Da Vinci Scholarship program provides approximately $400,000 in annual scholarships to underrepresented students and students with financial need in the entering class. A range of other scholarship programs are available, including the Ruth Jenkins Bristor Scholarship, Leslie King-Hammond Scholarship, Marwen Scholarship, McMillan Stewart Scholarship, ACT-SO Scholarship, Latino Beat Scholarship, C.V. Starr Scholarship, and Distinguished International Scholarship. MICA's Art & Design College Accelerator Program (ADCAP) provides a pathway to MICA for Baltimore City students who face financial challenges and are from diverse backgrounds. In Fall 2020, MICA welcomed its first class of eight ADCAP students and provided each with a full-ride scholarship covering tuition, fees, housing, and room and board. Additionally, the Eddie C. and C. Sylvia Brown Family Foundation International Study Abroad Grant provides support for underrepresented MICA students to pursue international study abroad opportunities. Targeted Financial Aid Programs Guaranteed Access Partnership Program $38,200 4EACH YEAR FOR YEARS bridgingGAPP is the gap to college access and affordability 69321Student Leadership INVOLVING STUDENTS IN LEADERSHIP positions is an important goal for MICUA members, all of which offer many opportunities for students to influence decision making. At McDaniel College, students of color are involved in all aspects of campus life and are leaders in the Student Government Association, Greek organizations, and all student-led organizations on campus. The Black Student Union, Africa's Legacy, Hispanic Latinx Alliance, and Asian Community Coalition are among the most active student organizations on campus. The Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (ODEI) works with students to develop leadership skills and meets regularly with the presidents of the organizations that fall under its umbrella. The ODEI has implemented a Cultural Leadership Council (CLC) with representatives from all cultural organizations. The CLC meets monthly to discuss upcoming programs, collaborations, and initiatives. The CLC has an elected executive board and it selects two members as representatives to the College's Board of Trustees. At Mount St. Mary's University, the Center for Student Diversity and other offices in the division of Student Affairs strive to encourage leadership involvement from all students. Out of the 300+ student leaders typically active in Student Affairs, 30-40% of those students identify as students of color. The Center for Student Diversity houses seven culturally based clubs and a peer educator program all led by students of color. The campus has a commitment to leadership and Mount students are involved in everything from academic clubs to athletics and ministry. Students of color serve on the President's Advisory Council for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion as well as on Mount's Inclusive Excellence Committee. At Stevenson University, involvement with organizations on campus provides students with leadership opportunities, and the University specifically encourages students to join, and eventually lead, cultural groups on campus. Students of color who regularly attend the Center for Diversity & Inclusion programs and events are always privy to campus leadership opportunities. The Center for Diversity & Inclusion Student Advisory Board was newly formed during the 2019-2020 academic year and continues to partner with the school on issues of diversity, equity and inclusion. The Board is comprised of six students from various class years, racial/ethnic identities, residential and commuter students, and multiple faith traditions. This Board meets with the Director of Diversity & Inclusion monthly to provide insights on campus climate, student programming needs and interests, and feedback on the efforts of the Center. At Washington Adventist University, the Office of Student Life is a welcoming and inclusive department representing the students to the greater campus community. The office is responsible for a variety of student leadership roles, including Student Association officers, student senators, resident assistants, and student professionals. In Fall 2020, the University's student body was 50% African American, 19% Hispanic, and 11% International. Student Life leadership roles, whether elected or appointed, have a balanced representation of the student body. The Office of Student Life uses various modes of communication to encourage student involvement. Faculty, staff, and student representatives are asked to submit recommendations as well as posters, flyers, newsletters, and advertisements on the WAU app promoting student leadership opportunities. Notre Dame of Maryland University 69422Diverse Faculty & Administrators\u2014Recruitment, Professional Development, & Retention A CRITICAL OBJECTIVE FOR MICUA members is to increase diversity among faculty and administrators. First launched in Fall 2015, Johns Hopkins University's Faculty Diversity Initiative (FDI) remains a cornerstone of the University's work around diversity and inclusion. All divisions have plans that specifically focus on diversity in faculty hiring with strategies that may include proactive recruitment of underrepresented minorities, diversity advocates on hiring committees, unconscious bias training for committee members, and final reports for all faculty searches. Most divisions have hired dedicated assistant deans for diversity and inclusion, implemented mentoring practices that focus on the needs of women and minorities, and conducted surveys of both current and former faculty, illuminating areas requiring increased attention. Every department continues to develop specific, discipline-appropriate mentoring plans for junior faculty members, assisted by a vice dean and the Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty Affairs. In July 2020, JHU formed the Anti-racism, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (ADEI) Steering Committee. The ADEI Steering Committee established the Community Conversations series, featuring conversations with the Vice Provost for Institutional Equity, the Vice Provost for Diversity and Inclusion, the Dean of the Peabody Institute, and listening sessions with the community. At Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA) , recruitment and retention of full- and part-time BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) faculty is a pillar of the College's Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Globalization agenda. Of the 42 full-time faculty recruited over the past five years, 24 identify as BIPOC; this past year, four of the five full-time faculty hires identify as BIPOC. Key strategies for 2019-2020 included implicit bias and anti-discrimination training for all search committees for faculty and academic leadership positions, updated trainings and recruitment guidelines, and further diversification of faculty search committees by including staff and student members. MICA established the Center for Teaching Innovation and Exchange to provide professional development in areas such as anti-discriminatory and inclusive teaching, multiculturalism, and other contemporary pedagogical practices; and to advance innovative teaching in the arts with a focus on diversity, inclusivity, and public engagement. During the Fall 2019 semester, Mount St. Mary's University's Inclusive Excellence Committee (MIEC) offered a Faculty and Administrative/Staff Professional Development Series including a four-part series on Inclusive Teaching and Learning; two reading/discussion groups using The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas, followed by a movie presentation and facilitated discussion; and a curriculum workshop on \"Facilitating Difficult Dialogue\" to assist and support the University's third annual TEACH-IN on Race. After the onset of COVID-19, MIEC facilitated a Zoom discussion session called \"Meeting Our Mount Students' Needs\" for faculty, administrators, and staff. Members of MIEC and Counseling Center staff shared how campus responses to the pandemic aligned with the University's commitment to Catholic Social Teaching and sought questions and suggestions from the community about next steps. Stevenson University has a formal mentoring program open to all faculty. The Faculty Peer Program: Supporting Diversity and Inclusion in the Classroom was developed as part of the University's 2018-2019 faculty development series and is still in place. The Diversity & Inclusion Committee has co-sponsored diversity events on campus and partnered with Human Resources, Faculty Development, the School of Humanities and Social Sciences, and the School of Design for various programs, including Ouch! That Stereotype Hurts, Understanding Unconscious Bias, Finding and Nurturing a Mentor Relationship, Decoding Diversity, Safe Space Training, Why Diversity is Upside Down, Racism and Black Lives Matter, The Fight for Civil Rights and Freedom, and Feminism: Why it's Still Important. Stevenson is currently completing year three as part of a Baltimore consortium receiving a Title IX grant, which has had a further impact on the University's diversity and inclusion efforts. Training topics have included content on engaging men, intersectionality and adaptation across subgroups, and first-generation students. When St. John's College advertises for faculty applicants, it does so in publications with a wide distribution, including diversity targeted jobsites and The Chronicle of Higher Education. The St. John's curriculum is interdisciplinary, and faculty teach across the curriculum, not only and not principally in their field of study. All faculty members receive support in appropriate ways to teach the College's various classes, including weekly faculty meetings with targeted purposes; team teaching with tenured, experienced faculty; and auditing classes. Professional development at St. John's is focused on small study groups to which new faculty belong. A series of faculty seminars were held during the 2020-2021 academic year on W.E.B. Dubois' The Souls of Black Folk. 69523MICUA INSTITUTIONS CONTINUALLY EVALUATE cultural diversity programs and practices using a range of internal campus assessments and outside resources. Goucher College has built a culture of using data to inform decision-making and accountability and understands the importance of assessing the campus environment and progress made toward building an equitable and inclusive community. To support these efforts, the following surveys were administered over the past two academic years: First-year Experience, ACE Feedback Form, COVID-19 Online Instruction, Student Needs Assessment, Faculty Needs Assessment, Staff Needs Assessment, Graduating Senior Survey, Exit Survey, and Returning Student Laptop Requirement Survey. In the College's past work with Baltimore Racial Justice Action (BRJA), a set of ongoing systematic assessments were developed and implemented, which included incorporating equity and diversity into strategic cascades and collecting information through focus groups and surveys. At Hood College, national surveys such as National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE), internal assessments/surveys, climate surveys, and student club and organization evaluations are used to provide feedback regarding the College's commitment and progress in promoting cultural diversity. Student leaders use these tools to plan future programs and events. The College adopted a standard set of competencies that overarch learning outcomes for all academic programs. The undergraduate competencies include diversity and global awareness\u2014challenging students to compare historical processes, cultural practices, ideological frameworks, and/or institutional structures across varying local or global communities. The competencies were approved by the Curriculum Committee and adopted by the faculty in Fall 2019; the collection of assessments for the competencies began in Spring 2020. Evaluation in Promoting Diversity Washington Adventist University 69624At Loyola University Maryland, Human Resources collaborates with Institutional Research and Academic Affairs on a periodic campus climate survey of students, faculty, staff, and administrators. Under the leadership of the Provost, the academic division sets and monitors annual goals aimed to enhance equity and make Loyola more fully inclusive as the required path for academic excellence. Goals and strategies for the year focused on culture, curriculum, ALANA faculty recruitment and retention, and ALANA student recruitment and retention. The Division of Student Development utilizes a range of approaches to assess performance in promoting cultural diversity, including the Resident Student Survey, The History of the Association of College and University Housing Officers-International/Educational Benchmarking Inc. (ACUHO-I/EBI), Multi-Institutional Survey on Leadership, Education Advisory Board (EAB) Climate Survey, National College Health Assessment (NCHA)-II Survey, and focus groups. Washington College's Diversity Committee, a standing group comprised of faculty, staff, and students, created a campus climate survey to help determine diversity agenda items for discussion and implementation in subsequent semesters and years. The climate survey will be conducted every three years to continue to shape the College's diversity agenda. The Diversity Committee and Equity and Inclusion in Athletics Committee have developed surveys to better understand the campus climate and any factors that could cause members of the community to feel excluded from full participation in campus life. The Office of Intercultural Affairs reports annually on its work, including quantitative and qualitative data, with regards to its impact on students across lines of difference. Survey results not only assess satisfaction with services, but also learning outcomes that provide the basis for measuring progress. In Spring 2020, students of color and other underrepresented students submitted a letter of grievances and an outline for the administration to address their concerns. The outcomes included establishment of the Intercultural Student Center, designation of gender-neutral bathrooms in all academic buildings, revisions to the bias incident protocol, discussions on diversifying the curriculum, formation of departmental diversity task forces, mandated diversity trainings for first year students, and intentional campus conversations about race and the state of diversity on campus. Capitol Technology University Johns Hopkins University 69725Best Practices IN THE INTEREST OF building on successful policies and creating a blueprint for success, MICUA has identified the following best practices related to the campus environment, students, faculty and administrators, and assessment and evaluation: Improving the Campus Environment (1) Inclusion of cultural diversity in the institution's mission statement and strategic plan serves as a constant reminder of the commitment of the institution to create an inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. Institutions seek to eliminate discrimination, foster positive relations between members of different racial and ethnic groups, and promote the ideals of social justice and equity. Phrases such as \"build inclusive communities\" and \"promote social responsibility\" are common in institutional mission statements. Strategic goals related to diversity positively impact enrollment, hiring practices, curriculum, and the community of learners. Cultural diversity must be a component of the general education rubric. (2) An office of diversity or a senior administrator responsible for diversity issues ensures that the institution's commitment to cultural diversity is implemented and is a central consideration in a broad range of campus activities. (3) Campus publications and classroom presentations reflect diversity in photos and articles. In addition, displays of artwork in various locations on campus include works by diverse artists. Campuses can support this effort by creating a database of resources available to faculty, staff, and administrators. (4) Librarians ensure that the library holdings include diverse materials, and faculty ensure that instructional materials cover diverse populations and perspectives. (5) Colleges and universities sponsor cultural events throughout the year to recognize diverse populations. The cultural events may include film and book discussions; guest speakers from a broad range of backgrounds; visual art displays; music, theater, and dance productions; and food-tasting experiences that reflect various cultures. Effective events are planned in a collaborative manner by students, faculty, and staff. Best Practices Related to Students (6) Effective strategies to recruit diverse students include: hosting college fairs in geographic areas with multi-cultural student populations, engaging high school guidance counselors to identify and recruit these students, and employing admissions counselors who are responsible for multicultural recruitment. (7) Partnerships with elementary and secondary schools with high minority enrollment are an excellent way to reach out to prospective students who may not be considering college. Institutional representatives invite prospective students to visit the campus and introduce them to students of color who are successful at the institution. Hood College 69826(8) Colleges and universities that embrace need-blind admissions policies and provide substantial need-based financial aid are more likely to attract diverse students. Endowed scholarship funds\u2014though not exclusively for minority students\u2014may be targeted toward high-ability students of color. Such scholarships reduce the dependence on loans and make an independent college or university affordable to low-income students. As a result of these efforts, the number of student applications increases and diversity improves. (9) Remove barriers that preclude low-income and first- generation students from considering college. Waive the application fee for underrepresented students, especially those who have participated in summer internships during high school. Provide scholarships or tuition waivers for academically talented and at-risk high school students who take college courses. Eliminate the requirement for SAT/ACT scores as part of the application process. By waiving fees, providing scholarships, and making standardized tests optional, institutions improve access and foster a welcoming environment. (10) A year-long first-year experience program helps students transition from high school to college. Guest speakers, book discussions, films, and other activities that focus on issues of race, oppression, power, and privilege, provide an opportunity for dialogue about these issues. In small group settings, students share, explore, and learn about each other's cultural, religious, or ethnic similarities and differences. This is vital in fostering unity throughout the college experience. (11) Students who participate in orientation programs as freshmen often become mentors to future classes. This gives students an opportunity to give back to the institution and to assist new students, especially those from underrepresented groups, to make a successful transition to college life. Institutions recruit a diverse group of experienced students to serve as orientation leaders. These student leaders can have discussions around issues of cultural diversity, its relationship to the mission of the institution, and implications for working with students of diverse cultures. (12) Summer bridge programs help students who have the ability to attain a college degree but require additional skills to succeed. These programs are also critical for students who are the first in their family to attend college. Students enhance their skills during the summer and eliminate the need for remedial or developmental courses once they matriculate into college. (13) Institutions offer tutoring, mentoring, and support programs for beginning students, particularly those whose high school academic program did not adequately prepare them for college-level work. These services are particularly important in the areas of study skills, time management, and stress reduction. Diversity is an important consideration in assigning tutors and mentors. (14) Grouping students together in a \"family\" (i.e., cohort) of individuals who mentor and support one another throughout their college experience is an effective practice. If one individual in the \"family\" falls behind in a course or program, the remaining members can assist to bring the student back on track. (15) Effective curriculum is infused with courses that address cultural diversity. Course content and delivery are sensitive to and promote diverse points of view and experiences among students. Institutions ensure that textbooks include the global and cultural diversity issues appropriate to the topic of study. Institutions offer courses and majors in ethnic studies and encourage students to enroll in courses about non-western civilizations to learn the history, language, and customs of other cultures. Educational programs such as teaching and nursing embed community-based projects into the curriculum. These field experiences may be in schools or other settings that include disadvantaged children and/or adults. 69927(16) Culturally competent colleges and universities include service learning as part of the curriculum. Community service projects offer students, faculty, and staff an opportunity to reach out to areas of the State that are underserved by providing services, such as after-school enrichment activities, tutoring, mentoring, English-language training, health care screening, and home repairs. Effective service-learning programs allow students to work alongside professionals to rebuild communities. Community outreach efforts are designed to promote cross-cultural exchange and provide support for underrepresented ethnic groups. Participation in such activities helps broaden understanding of economic, social, and cultural issues. Students reflect on their experiences, which often have a profound impact on their lives and social consciousness. (17) Institutions make a commitment to human rights for all citizens by making social responsibility an integral part of the educational experience. This goes beyond students and faculty on campus to the surrounding community and the world. Higher education has a responsibility to teach best practices\u2014whether in providing health care for disadvantaged citizens or creating a sustainable environment\u2014that students take with them throughout their lives. (18) Study abroad programs that provide immersion in other cultures, customs, and languages are important for participating students and the campus at large. When students return to campus, the insights they gained help to enrich classroom discussions as they reflect upon their experiences in other countries. Study abroad opportunities influence future leaders in a global learning community that promotes justice, health, sustainability, and peace. (19) Leadership development is an important aspect of campus life. Effective institutions make certain that student leaders on campus represent a diverse population, and that students of color are nominated for leadership positions, including student government, club leaders, campus-wide committees, resident assistants, and new student orientation leaders. Leadership training helps students develop their potential and incorporates themes including what it means to be a leader in a community of diverse populations. (20) To ensure diverse viewpoints are represented, institutions should encourage all students to contribute ideas and articles to the student newspaper. (21) Student affairs professionals should make certain that diversity is part of the residential life experience. This includes ensuring that a diverse pool of resident assistants is selected to interact with students in the residence halls. In addition, training for resident assistants should include matters related to cultural differences. Best Practices Related to Faculty and Administrators (22) Diversity among faculty and administrators enhances the educational experiences of all students and enriches intellectual discourse among the faculty. Institutions recruiting for faculty and administrator positions should target media outlets with diverse viewers. Efforts should be made to ensure that the institution has not used language in an advertisement that would narrow the field of eligible applicants. Effective institutions participate in career fairs sponsored by minority associations, such as the Association of Black Psychologists or the Society of Women Engineers. These activities have been successful in helping institutions to increase minority hires. (23) Some institutions have successfully used fellowships to attract faculty of color to campus. These institutions have fostered an environment of inclusion during the fellowship year, which has encouraged visiting faculty to remain on a permanent basis after the conclusion of the fellowship. (24) Effective institutions foster ongoing collaborations with historically Black colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions to attract diverse students to graduate programs. These students may serve as college faculty upon completion of their graduate programs. 70028(25) Several institutions have worked collaboratively with similar institutions in the region to address the recruitment of diverse faculty. The consortium approach has been successful in expanding opportunities and improving the retention of faculty of color. This helps to increase representation of specific ethnic groups and create a critical mass, which is especially important for small and rural campuses. (26) Institutions should offer training seminars designed to enhance the ability of colleges and universities to hire diverse faculty. The strategies learned in the seminars have proven to be successful in increasing the percentage of faculty of color. (27) To prepare educators for leadership at the next level, institutions should offer professional development to diverse faculty and administrators. (28) Effective faculty orientation includes information about issues impacting culturally diverse students. It is important that faculty understand cultural differences to create a supportive learning environment. (29) Diversity awareness training for faculty, staff, and administrators helps create an inclusive working environment. Effective programs include components for coaching and mentoring that emphasize diversity-minded institutional leadership, supervision strategies, and policy development. (30) Institutions may benefit by sponsoring local chapters of formal organizations of faculty and administrators who share a particular ethnic or gender identity, such as Women in Science and Engineering or the Black Faculty and Staff Association. Such groups advocate and provide a unifying voice for their members, offer networking and professional development opportunities, and serve as an information resource to the college or university administration. In addition, the organizations work to recruit colleagues into fields that have been historically underrepresented by women and minorities. The local chapters often host regional or national meetings of the association.(31) Flexible scheduling options provide incentives, especially for faculty and staff with young children. Some examples are job sharing, teleworking, on-site child care, shift compression, and liberal make-up policies. Assessment and Evaluation (32) An effective part of evaluation is measuring success. Institutions that are successful in closing the achievement gap in retention and graduation rates between minority and majority populations are more likely to attract students and faculty of color.
