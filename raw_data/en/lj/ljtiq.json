After her appointment, Jacob personally made a follow-up phone call to Emma on Friday to see if everything met her expectations on the first visit. Dr. Jacob asked her if there was anything else he could do to help. He also answered her questions and provided additional information on exercises that can help Emma relieve her back pain. Emma was impressed by his follow-up and appreciated the extra care and attention he gave her. As a result, she told at least five people about her positive experience with Dr. Jacob. It was a gold star move by the doctor. His patients appreciated the extra effort he put into their care and felt valued and heard. With word-of-mouth referrals, Dr. Jacob increased his business by three-fold within a few months. Just like Dr. Jacob, chiropractors who follow up with their patients are sure to see success in their practice and make a positive impact on the lives of those they treat.
