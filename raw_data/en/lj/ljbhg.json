The naturopathic physician seeks to identify and remove the underlying causes of illness, rather than eliminate or merely suppress symptoms. Naturopathic diagnosis focuses on identifying the underlying causes of disease, while naturopathic therapies are supported by research drawn from peer-reviewed journals from many disciplines.The therapeutic modalities used in naturopathic medicine (including physical manipulation, clinical nutrition, botanical medicine, homeopathy, and hydrotherapy) integrate conventional, scientific, and empirical methodology with the ancient laws of nature. OWM's Naturopathic Medicine doctor, Kim Howes ND, is a member of the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ilads.org), the leading international medical society devoted to treatment of Lyme and Associated tick-borne diseases with evidence-based medicine. She is a graduate of National University of Natural Medicine, Portland, Oregon. "}
