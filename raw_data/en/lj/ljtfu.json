Though required as a basis for teacher education, it can be attended separately. It focusses on the written work of Rudolf Steiner, courses in a variety of arts, an introduction to a contemporary path of inner development, and other fruits of anthroposophy presented by distinguished guest speakers. The goal of these courses is to awaken participants to an awareness of the spiritual basis of our own humanity and its relationship to nature and society in which we are embedded. Such knowledge can guide us to positive actions within our own lives and help us find truly creative solutions to the pressing issues that face us. Foundations Studies classes run on Saturday mornings from 8:30 am to 1:35 pm over a period of one year, with an additional week of courses in late June. A Certificate of Completion is conferred once all classes have been fulfilled, and course credits would be honored at any of the North American Waldorf teacher education institutes towards further training. [The day continues through the afternoon until 4:55 for those fully enrolled in the 2 year Teacher Ed. or Early Childhood programs.] Courses Foundation Studies at the Alkion Center is taught for a total of 28 Saturdays over the course of the school year from mid-Sept. - mid-May., plus the one full week in June.
