Officials, civilians, traditional or religious authorities, women, elderly people and children gathered to participate in the official launch ceremony of the Local Polio Vaccination Days. The DRC declared a polio-free country The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) was certified polio-free in November 2015. Since March 2017, the country has seen 9 cases of the polio virus, of which two were in Maniema and seven were in Haut Lomami. A case of polio classified as \"ambiguous\" was also noted in the Province of Tanganyika. The most recent case was reported in July 2017 in the Province of Haut Lomami. It concerned a 17 month-old child who had never received a dose of OPV (Oral Polio Vaccine), although two vaccination drives had been organised in the area. This child was part of the main groups resistant to vaccination (Philadelphia, Postolo alliance party, Kishila and the African Black Church) and lives in an unstable area controlled by the Mai Mai. This would suggest that polio could have spread. Vaccinate to save In the Haut Lomami Province, many children are not vaccinated because their parents refuse, due to religious beliefs and the absence of - or no return - of households. Many towns remain poorly vaccinated and the children are not collected by the vaccination drives. In order to strengthen immunity in children from 0 to 5 years old, the vaccination campaign was launched on 12th October 2017 under the leadership of His Excellency Mr Ngoy Mwaka, cabinet director representing the Governor of the Haut Lomami Province. A lot of people engaged with the event. A day for social mobilisation in favour of the vaccination Beyond its festive character, this launch day was the time to convey a key message to the population - that the vaccine is crucial to allow every child to grow up in good health. It is a child's right and the parents' duty. All the parents were invited to vaccinate their children while the vaccinators were there. These messages were addressed to the Mwitobwe populations in the local language to promote their participation in the polio vaccination scheme. The children themselves were messengers, telling parents their feelings about the vaccination with a heartfelt cry - \"We are children. We have the right to health and it is your duty to vaccinate us!\" A drama demonstration showed the behaviour of the head of a family who was against vaccination. One of his children suddenly became ill with polio, and he regretted never having vaccinated the child. The audience remembered that \"prevention is better than a cure.\" This message was supported by the story of D\u00e9sir\u00e9, who suffers from polio. The aim: to reassure the people The aim of the launch ceremony was to create big social mobilisation around health actions in general - particularly around vaccination - and to spread key messages through the highest authorities in order to reassure the people about participating. The population of Mwitobwe did not remain on the sidelines, because it had lessons full of educational value in order to change behaviour. Community development rests on the vaccination of its children. "}
