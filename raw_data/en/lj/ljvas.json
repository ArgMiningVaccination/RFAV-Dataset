More and more families are discovering that periodic chiropractic checkups and adjustments promote health and healing without drugs and dangerous medical treatments. More and more people are turning away from symptom treatment and choosing natural way s of achieving and maintaining health. Tired of taking drugs and the medical runaround? Welcome to the world of chiropractic - discover how natural health can be! Stay healthy: don't get a flu shot We are approaching flu shot season again. Drug companies spend millions advertising the not only useless but dangerous flu shot that causes brain and nervous system damage. Not many people know this, the media doesn't report it, but the U.S. government records vaccine injuries and deaths and the flu vaccine has been linked to both. Government records show the flu vaccine kills and damages more people than all the other vaccines combined. The mercury in the shot has been linked to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, MS and autism. (2) There is no proof that pregnant women, children, babies or adults (especially asthmatics) get any benefit from it. Send this information to those you care about. 1. The flu shot actually makes you sick to begin with Have you ever noticed how vaccinated children get sick almost immediately following a vaccination? This is because the flu virus is introduced into their bodies. So rat her than immunize, the flu shot actually only sensitizes the body against the virus. And the fact that it causes individuals to get ill following a shot indicates immuno-suppression (i.e. lowering of the immunity). 2. Flu vaccines contain other dangerous ingredients such as mercury The pharmaceutical industry, medical experts and the mainstream media are candid in telling us that flu vaccine s contain strains of the flu virus. What they are less likely to reveal though is the long list of other ingredients that come with the vaccine. It is now a known fact that flu vaccines contain mercury, a heavy metal known to be hazardous for human health. Mercury toxicity can cause depression, memory loss, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory problems, ADD, oral health problems, digestive imbalances and other serious health issues. 3. The flu shot can cause Alzheimer's disease 3 Evidence now suggests that flu vaccines can cause Alzheimer's disease. Research conducte d by Dr. Hugh Fudenberg, a leading immunogeneticist, shows that those who consistently get the flu v accine increase their risk of Alzheimer's disease by 10-fold. He believes this is due to the toxic combination of aluminum and mercury in the vaccine. Additionally, introducing the flu virus to an elderly person (who with age will naturally have a w eaker immune system) will only increase the chances of that individual becoming susceptible to more se rious illness. 4. The very people pushing flu vaccinations are making billions of dollars each year In August 1999, the Committee on Government Reform initiated an investigation into Fe deral vaccine policy. This investigation focused on possible conflicts of interest on the part of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The investigation concluded that many indiv iduals serving on two key advisory committees had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture vaccines. Often, these individuals were granted waivers to fully participate in the discussions that led to recommend ations on vaccine licensing and adding vaccines to the Childhood Immunization Schedule. This in itself creates se rious doubt as to how effective flu vaccines really are. 5. Lack of real evidence that young children even benefit from flu shots 51 studies involving 260,000 children age 6 to 23 months established no evidenc e that the flu vaccine is any more effective than a placebo. Additionally, flu shots only protect against certain strains of the virus meaning that you can still easily get the flu if you come into contact with a different strain of virus. 6. Makes you more susceptible to pneumonia and other contagious diseases For someone with an already suppressed immune system, injecting strains of the flu virus can have devastating consequences. If your body is already working to fight off a virus or simply operating with low immunity, a vaccine injection could put your body in serious danger of contracting influenza with stronger symptoms, or even w orse pneumonia and other contagious diseases. 7. Vascular disorders Medical research shows flu shots are associated with an increased risk of vascular inflammation. Sympt oms include fever, jaw pain, muscle aches, pain and stiffness in the neck, upper arms, shoulder and hips and headache. 8. Children under the age of 1 are at risk Children under 1 years of age are highly vulnerable to a neurotoxic breach of the delicate nerve c enter surrounding the brain and central nervous system. The first round of the flu vaccine is administered at age 6 mont hs. A child under the age of 1 lacks sufficient protection to guard against premature damage to the blood barrier in the brain. 9. Increased risk of narcolepsy There have been dozens of reported cases of children in 12 different countries who have deve loped narcolepsy (a chronic sleep disorder) after receiving the flu vaccine. The study, which took place betw een October 2009 and the December 2011, compared 3.3 million vaccinated Swedes with 2.5 million who were not vaccinated. The risk was found to be highest among the youngest people who took the vaccines. For those under the age of 21, the risk of contracting narcolepsy was three times higher. 10. Weakens immunological responses There have been literally thousands of medical journal articles published that show injecting vaccines can lead to harmful immunological responses and a host of other infections. Moreover, weak immunological responses only decrease a person's ability to fight the diseases that the vaccine was supposed to pr otect against in the first place. 4 11. Serious neurological disorders Evidence now suggests that ingredients in flu vaccinations can actually cause serious neurological disorders. In 1976 a significant number of those who received the flu vaccine acquired Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (G BS), a disorder characterized by permanent nerve damage and even paralysis. Flu vaccines can contain many harmful materials including detergent, mercury, formaldehyde, and strains of live flu virus. The flu shot: useless and dangerous J. Anthony Morris, Ph.D. former Chief Vaccine Control Officer, US Food and Drug Administration and flu vaccine expert: There is no evidence that any influenza vaccine thus far developed is effective in preventing or mitigating any attack of influenza. The producers of these vaccines know that they are worthless, but they go on selling them anyway. (3) NATURAL FLU FIGHTER GET ADJUSTED! Any subluxations in your spine interferes with your nervous system and lowers your body's abiity to maintain its own health. Regular chiropractic adjustments keep your immune system strong! 5 Stay healthy this Fall with traditional foods Marrow to the rescue . If there is one ideal food for health and healing, it's bone marro w - the key ingredient in soups and broths. Bone marrow seems to have the right stuff for healing and rejuvenati on. Because it hides deep in our bones few people realize marrow is one of the largest organs in the human bo dy ... it is considered a primary lymphatic organ. [Bone marrow] performs hemopoiesis - the process by w hich stem cells generate the platelets, leukocytes, and erythrocytes needed for coagulation, immunit y, and oxygen transport. (7) 6 With cold and flu season upon us, you might want to learn how to make bone broth so you can stock up on this superliquid. For those, not in the know, bone broth is stock on steroids (not literally, of course). Back before meat and vegetables came already cut up and wrapped in styrofoam and plastic, our grandparents used to make mineral rich bone broth from bones, scraps and other leftover bits. Nothing was allowed to go to waste. Unfortunately, we lost the knowledge to make this nourishing foo d. What Is Bone Broth? Everyone knows what stock is, right? Stock is the base for any good soup o r stew made from simmering bits of meat, vegetables and aromatics in water for 4-6 hours. Many people buy alre ady made meat stock from the grocery store, but the homemade stuff is the best. Bone broth is simply st ock that is cooked for a much longer period of time -as long as 24-48 hours. Bone broth is rich in vitamins, minerals, good fats and tissue-restora tive collagen. Each bowl of bone broth is a boost to the immune system. Bone broth is a favorite among those who choose to eat the Paleo diet and is also beneficial for those with digestive disorders and autoimmune con ditions. Do't take y ord for it though; read hy oe roth is osidered a superfood fro The Paleo Mom, the Whole 9 and Wellness Mama. How to Make Bone Broth I make two kinds of bone broth -chicken and beef. The process is the same for both, but the coo king length is different. Chicken bone broth is done after 24 hours of cooking, will beef bone broth needs 48 hours to cook. Ingredients: 2 pounds of good quality beef bones (I usually get knuckles and rib bones from a local butcher. The bones do need to be sliced open to expose the marrow. Ask your butch er to do this). 2 carrots, roughly chopped 2 stalks of celery, roughly chopped 1 onion, roughly chopped (if tolerated) fresh herbs like parsley, thyme, rosemary 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar (helps break down the bones and marrow) filtered water How-to make bone broth: 1. Place bones in a crock pot. A slow cooker is necessary because you will be cooki ng this for stock for 48 hours, ad I' assuig you pla to sleep ad leae the house. 2. Add carrots, celery, onions and herbs. 3. Fill the slow cooker up with water so the bones and vegetables are covered. 4. Pour in the apple cider vinegar. 5. Turn slow cooker on high for 8 hours. Turn down to low after that. 7 6. Cook for a total of 48 hours. 7. Spoon out and discard the vegetables and bones. 8. Strain the broth with a fine mesh strainer to catch any bones or other bits you may have missed. The final product can be stored in freezer safe containers for up to 6 months ( I use mason jars leaving an 1- 2 inches of room for the liquid to expand). To make chicken bone broth, simply substitute chicken bones (they do not need to cut open as they will break down on their own) and cook for 24 hours. Use in soups or stews, add to mashed potatoes or mashed cauliflower or simply drink a mug in the morning with breakfast. How Fluoride lowers your IQ A new study published in the Institute of Environmental Health Sciencesjournal Environmental Health Perspectives has found that fluoride damages brain development and leads to significantly lower IQ levels in humans. A 2008 Scientific American report stated that \"Scientific attitudes toward fluoridation may be starting to shift\" as new evidence revealed the link between fluoride and disorders affecting, bones, teeth, the thyroid gland, and brain. The study also \"Concluded that fluoride can subtly alter endocrine function, especially in the thyroid \u2014 the gland that produces hormones regulating growth and metabolism.\" Fluoride can be found not only in water and toothpaste, but also in processed foods made with fluoridated water. Next time you brush your teeth, take a look at the back label of your tooth paste. Most of the conventional toothpastes tell you to \"contact a poison control center immediately\" if you swallow your toothpaste. Really? And this is something that we use daily! 12 Strategies to Strengthen Your Immune System Modern medicine can help if you get sick, but for the most part it's up to you whether you maintain good health. If you want good health, here are some tips to strengthen your immu ne system naturally. 8 Eating a variety of colorful vegetables is just one easy (and delicious!) way to naturally strengthen your immune system. Infections are as inevitable as death and taxes. You spend your first years catching colds, influenza and strep throat. You sniffle, scratch, cough, vomit, ache, sweat and shiver. Your immune system remembers the microbes it has encountered and protects you the next go around. At the other end of life, your immune system wearies from years of fighting. In that great expanse of active, productive life in between, you still get colds and flus and \"stomach bugs.\" You may wonder why you are sick more or less often than your partner, co-workers and neighbors. You may wonder why one person hacking on the airplane successfully sickens the passenger to his right but not the one to his left. The answe r is that not all immune systems function alike. A number of factors affect immune system health. S ome you can't control: The very young and the very old are vulnerable. Surgery and wounds give microb es a chance to sneak into the inner sanctum. Other risks include chronic disease, poverty, stress, living with lots of other people (dormitories, low-income housing), and drinking tap water (with its local microbe s) in many foreign countries. Fortunately, there are ways you can strengthen your immune system. 1: Eat Like Peter Rabbit. Malnutrition impairs immune function. French fries, soft drinks and bourbon don't build strong white blood cells either. No, it's those virtuous, self -righteous diets high in fruits, vegetables and nuts that promote immune health, presumably because they're rich in nutrients the immune system requires. Adequate protein intake is also important; the source can be plant or animal. Medicinal mushrooms such as shiitake, maitake and reishi contain beta-glucans (complex carbohydrates) that enhance immune activity against infections and cancer and reduce allergies (cases of inappropriate immune system activity). While studies have focused on purified mushroom extracts, fresh shiitake and maitake (also called \"hen of the woods\") mushrooms are delicious saut\u00e9ed in a little olive oil. One substance to avoid is simple sugar. Brigitte Mars, herbalist and author of The Desktop Guide to Herbal Medicines , notes that sugary foods and juices impair immune function; research bears her out. If you're a new mother, breast milk provides essential nutrients and immune system components to your developing child. Compared with formula-fed babies, those nourished at the breast have fewer serious infections. 2: Stress Less. When you're stressed, your adrenal glands churn out epinephrine (aka, adrenaline) and cortisol. While acute stress pumps up the immune system, grinding long-term duress taxes it. For instance, psychological stress raises the risk for the common cold and other viruses. Less often, chronic stress can promote a hyper- reactive immune system and aggravate conditions such as allergies, asthma and autoimmune disease. While most of us can't move into a spa, we can learn to save our stress responses for true emerge ncies and not fire them up over stalled traffic, bad hair days and aphids on the begonias. Stress-reducing activities such as meditation produce positive changes in the immune system. Massage has shown to improve immune function in studies of Dominican children with HIV. Quiet music can aid recovery from everyday hassles and may therefore buttress immune function. 9 3: Move Your Body. Moderate exercise discharges tension and stress and enhances immune function. In a 2006 study, researchers took 115 obese, sedentary, postmenopausal women and assigned half of them to stretching exercises once a week and the other half to at least 45 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise five days a week. At the end of the year-long study, the stretchers had three times the rate of colds as the moderate- exercise group. 4: Sleep Soundly. Sleep is a time when growth-promoting and reparative hormones knit up the raveled sleeve of daily life. Sleep deprivation activates the stress response, depresses immune function and elevates inflammatory chemicals (which cause you to feel ill). Chronic sleep deprivation raises the risk of the common cold. Mothers whose small children interrupt their sleep have more respiratory infections, particularly if those wee ones go to day care. In one study, after researchers inoculated volunteers' noses with cold viruses (a reward was involved), men and women who habitually slept less than seven hours a night were almost three times more likely to develop a cold than those who slept eight hours or more. 5: Socialize More. People with richer social lives enjoy better health and longevity than loners do. You may think that the more people you interact with, the more chances you have for picking something up. Not so. Again, researchers blew cold viruses up peop le's noses and sent them into the world. Compared with the lone wolves, the social butterflies were less susceptible to developing common colds, and, if they did get sick, they had fewer symptoms for a shorter period of time. Many of us count furred and feathered companions as friends, and it turns out they do us a world of good. Animals such as dogs and horses get us outside exercising. Stroking an animal stirs feelings of well-being, lowers blood pressure and, according to recent research, boosts the immune system. Researchers assigned college students to pet either a stuffed dog or a live dog. Those who petted a real dog had a significant increase in levels of salivary IgG, an antibody (immune protein) that fights infection. Those who petted the stuffed dog just felt silly. 6: Make more love. While having lots of friends is healthy, science also shows that intimate, sexual relationships have immune system perks. Michael Castleman, renowned health writer and publisher of Great Sex After 40 , writes, \"A 2004 study shows that the close contact of lovemaking reduces the risk of colds.\" Specifically, this study found that college students who had sex once or twice a week had 30 percent more salivary IgA antibody than those who had sex infrequently. 7: Shun Tobacco Smoke. Tobacco smoke triggers inflammation, increases respiratory mucus, and inhibits the hairlike projections inside your nose (cilia) from clearing that mucus. Children and adults exposed to tobacco smoke are more at risk for respiratory infections, including colds, bronchitis, pneumonia, sinusitis and middle ear infections. 8: Consume Friendly Bacteria. Beneficial microorganisms colonize our intestinal, lower urinary and upper respiratory trac ts. They outcompete bad \"bugs\" and enhance immune function. You can consume such bacteria in the form of live-cultured products such as yogurt, sauerkraut and kimchi. Probiotic supplements, available at natural food stores, may reduce the risk of antibiotic-induced diarrhea, viral diarrhea, vaginitis and respiratory infections. 9: Expose Yourself. Vitamin D plays a number of roles in promoting normal immune function. Vitamin D deficiency correlates with asthma, cancer, several autoimmune diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis), and 10 susceptibility to infection (including viral respiratory infections). One study linked deficiency to a greater likelihood of carrying MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) in the nose. Unfortunately, nearly one-third of the U.S. population is vitamin D deficient. Because few foods contain much vitamin D, your best bet is to regularly spend short periods of time in the sun (without sunscreen), and to take supplements in northern climes during the colder months. Guidelines for the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of vitamin D, currently set at 400 IU/day, are being revised. Experts predict that the new RDA will be about 1,000 IU/day (25 ug/day). 10: Choose Vitamin and Mineral Supplements Wisely. Studies link deficiencies of zinc, selenium, folic acid, and vitamins A, B6, C, D and E to reduced immune function. But scientists have yet to pinpoint exact levels of these nutrients for optimal immune function, much less whether dietary supplementation really helps the average, well-fed American. For instance, research on vitamin C for prevention and treatment of the common cold has been inconclusive. Some micronutrients, notably vitamin A, can be toxic in overdose. Excessive levels of zinc paradoxically suppress immune function. A varied, plant-based diet and a good multivitamin supplement should meet your needs. 11: Immunize Yourself. Routine vaccinations have had a huge impact on reducing, and in many cases nearly eradicating, a number of infectious diseases. Most immunizations occur during childhood. Vaccinations for adults to consider include yearly influenza vaccines, tetanus boosters, the shingles vaccine for people 60 and up, and the pneumococcus vaccine for people over the age of 65. For more information, check with the Centers for Disease Control. 12: Familiarize Yourself With Immune-Enhancing Herbs. A long list of medicinal plants contain chemicals that enhance immune system activity, including echinacea, eleuthero (also called Siberian ginseng), ginseng (Asian and American), astragalus, garlic, and shiitake, reishi and maitake mushrooms. Garlic is t he favorite choice of many. In addition to boosting the immune system, it's anticancer and antimicrobial against a variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. Key ingredients don't survive cooking, so add a clove or two of raw, minced garlic to meals just before serving. When someone in my family sniffles, I make an immune soup based on a recipe Brigitte Mars shared with me years ago: Pretend you're making chicken soup. Saut\u00e9 onions, shiitake mushrooms and chicken, adding just enough water to keep the chicken from drying out. Remove the chicken when it's cooked and set aside. Add fresh vegetables such as carrots and celery. Cover with plenty of water. Toss in three or four astragalus roots (the pressed roots, available in natural foods stores or from online herb retailers such as Mountain Rose Herbs and Pacific Botanicals). Toward the end of cooking, add Italian seasonings (thyme, rosemary, oregano), which are tasty and antimicrobial, and the chopped, cooked chicken. Before serving, add fresh, pressed garlic (one to two cloves per person) and remove the astragalus roots. The Hygiene Hypothesis 11 Some people respond to front-page news about microbes \u2014 bird flu, flesh-eating bacteria, pathogenic E. coli \u2014 with excessive soap, water and hand-sanitizer use, along with avoidance of fun activities such as dining out, hugging dogs, camping, French kissing and mud wrestling. But the science says to get a little dirty. Some exposure to \"germs\" will mature and strengthen your immune system. Some experts even point to evidence that an over-sanitized environment is bad for your health, increasing the risk of allergic, autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. The so-called Hygiene Hypothesis posits that exposure to microbes early in life flexes and shapes the immune system to do what it was designed to do, like fight off the ebola virus. Growing up in an ultra-clean environment, though, may produce an immune system that attacks innocuous things (animal dander, ragweed pollen, your own cells), leading to chronic inflammation. In support of that hypothesis, children who grow up in larger families (blessed with germy siblings), live in the country (around barnyard animals), or attend day care have lower rates of conditions such as asthma, hay fever and eczema. On the other hand, improved sanitation (along with vaccinations and antibiotics) has clearly decreased the death rate from infections and lengthened our lives. Infections, however, continue to challenge us, which means that the Hygiene Hypothesis (and other immunity-boosting practices) remains a hot topic in immunology circles.
