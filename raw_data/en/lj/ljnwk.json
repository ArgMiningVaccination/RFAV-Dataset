If you have had a major burn injury, you may have been fed through a feeding tube for a while (see glossary on page 1). This enables us to meet your high nutritional needs during the early stages of your recovery. The reason for this is because having a major burn significantly increases your body's metabolic rate for many months following your injury (see glossary on page 1). Your body's need for protein and calories is much increased, even after your injury has first healed (see glossary below). Even smaller burn injuries may require a higher protein and energy diet. In this case, eating and drinking can be done by mouth. Changing from tube feeding to feeding by mouth When changing from being tube fed to having food by mouth, sometimes you may have your tube removed to help with swallowing. You must be wide awake and be able to manage to cough up your saliva properly. Start off with small amounts of pureed foods (see glossary below) and take sips of nutritional supplement drinks. These drinks can be prescribed by your dietitian (see 'nutritional supplements'). A change in the sound of your voice or coughing when first drinking or eating indicates that you may not be ready to drink or eat yet. However, if you find you have managed pureed textures well, trialling soft, mashable foods for your first meal would be recommended. It is important to chew more than you normally would. You may feel full very quickly when you first start to eat solid food again. You may start to feel more thirsty than usual. Drinking nutritional supplement drinks can provide a good source of nutrition at this time. Poor appetite A poor appetite is very common following a burn injury. This can be for many reasons some of which include: being in hospital, worrying, restrictive dressings, pain, pain on dressing changes, constipation, dislike of hospital food, feeling sick, feeling weak and taste changes. However, at this time in hospital after your injury, your body's nutritional needs tend to be much higher. Therefore it is important to view food as an essential part of the healing process and make as much effort with your eating and drinking as you can. To help stimulate the appetite you can try: - Eating more frequently; \"little & often\", eg. 5-6 small meals or snacks, rather than 2-3 larger meals; try something every few hours. This is because not eating in itself can cause low appetite - Eat what you want, whenever you want. Whilst in hospital, it can be useful to ask family and/or friends to bring in foods from outside the hospital - If you've lost interest in food: Think of a food where the smell or sight of it usually makes you look forward to tasting it, then try a small portion - Make eating easy; choose simple meals & snacks, and when at home, ensure cupboards/fridge are well stocked; choose favourite foods - Choose nutritious fluids: do not fill up on water, tea, coffee; remember that drinking before a meal can fill you up - If taking supplement drinks, only have these after a meal, otherwise they may fill you up Nutritional supplements prescribed by dietitian Sometimes high energy/high protein supplement drinks will be suggested by your dietitian. These are easy ways to take in a concentrated amount of energy and are available on prescription. - Only use supplements when your appetite / weight is low - Use to 'supplement the diet', not as meal replacements - Try to take after or between meals, not before or with meals - Juice based drinks(eg Ensure plus juice) can be made into jellies or sorbets/slushes. If too thick, they can be diluted with fizzy drinks - lemonade, ginger ale, Fanta, tango (try not to dilute with water alone). - Milk based drinks (eg Ensure Plus, Fortisip Extra) can be frozen to make ice cream or heated, (remove from packet if heating in a microwave). They can be added to custards or yoghurts. If too thick, they can be diluted with milk. - Food Fortifiers (eg, Protifar powder) can be added to foods and drinks to increase protein. - Supplements can be mixed with alcohol after you have been discharged from hospital (if alcohol allowed and does not interfere with medication). Drinks Liquids are important but can be filling. Try to ensure drinks provide calories by possibly substituting water/coffee/tea with some of the following: - Cocoa, drinking chocolate, coffee (made with all milk, i.e. latt\u00e9 or cappuccino, cream, evaporated milk) - Full fat milk (fortified) and milkshakes (fortified) - Lucozade or energy drinks - Fruit juices and full sugar squashes eg. Ribena / Robinsons - Drinking yoghurt - Fizzy drinks, include ginger ale (NB. can cause bloating) - Fruit smoothies (bought or homemade with fortified milk) Food and fluid fortification Choose high energy, high protein foods. Eating more of these will help you to gain/maintain weight. This means avoiding diet / slimline / low fat / no added sugar products. Fats and oil have the highest amount of energy per gram compared with all other foods in our diet & are therefore invaluable in food fortification. Fortify foods & fluids using the methods below whenever possible to add extra energy: - Fortified milk - Add 3-4 tablespoons skimmed milk powder, (e.g. Marvel) to 1 pint full fat milk. Use this in soups, sauces, puddings, drinks, and on cereal - Add butter or margarine spreads liberally on bread, toast, crackers, vegetables & potatoes - Fry or add oil to dishes like rice and pasta - Add yoghurt / fromage frais / cream cheese / cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche / cream to stews, soups, drinks (use full fat products) - Add grated cheese, cream / sour cream, fortified milk to soups & sauces. Have sauces on meats, potatoes and pasta - Add evaporated milk to soup, sauces, milk & other puddings (eg jelly) If you have been told by your Doctor / Dietitian that you have high cholesterol or heart problems, try using poly or mono-unsaturated oils/spreads whenever possible. This are better for heart health. High calorie foods good for heart health include: - Oils & Spreads: olive, vegetable (rapeseed), sunflower, safflower, soya, corn. Olive oil based spread - Oily Fish: Mackerel, salmon, sardines, herring, pistachio, pecans - Avocado: use in salads, sandwiches or as a snack Long Term Diet With larger burns, your energy needs for healing continue to be very high, sometimes up until 12 months from the date of injury. Some people with very large burns have shown to have had high energy needs for up to 2 years after they have healed, however, this is quite rare. Generally, you will need to eat a diet high in protein and energy up until your burn is fully healed or as advised by your burns dietitian. Once your burn is fully healed and your weight is stable, then you can switch to a healthier balanced diet that the general population are advised to follow. Please refer to pages 14 and 15 for guidance regarding this. Vitamin and Mineral Supplementation You may be prescribed vitamin and mineral supplements or a nutritional supplement whilst you are in hospital and after discharge from hospital. Copper, selenium, zinc, vitamin C are regularly given to patients with a larger burn injury. This is because they help with wound healing. Please ask your Dietitian how long you need to take them after you are discharged from hospital. Generally, supplements are no longer necessary when your burns have healed and you start to maintain your weight. Breakfast Ideas - Cereals - Use fortified milk (see recipe). Porridge/Ready Brek, made with fortified milk, cream, evaporated milk, yoghurt. Try adding dried fruit, fresh fruit or nuts.
