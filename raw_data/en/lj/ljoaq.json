Our primary goal is to help our patients naturally eliminate their pain once and for all, instead of masking it with painkillers! Dr. Rinaldi delivers effective treatments and lasting results. At Amplify Chiropractic & Wellness, Dr. Rinaldi takes a 360\u00ba approach with each and every patient. A comprehensive examination helps him identify and correct the source of your pain - going beyond Chiropractic adjustments to address problem areas in the soft tissue surrounding the spine that are pulling the spine out of alignment. Dr. Rinaldi examines each patient's symptoms individually, taking into account the circumstances that led to the injury and/or impairment. He will then determine the best course of treatment by assessing the position of your spine and pinpointing the source(s) of your pain. Orthopedic and neurological tests help him to determine your range of motion and overall muscle tone and a thorough scan allows him to detect any scar tissue that might be impeding proper function and movement in the muscles/fascia. Restore mobility. Relieve pain. Regain the lifestyle you deserve. With the aid of hands-on spinal manipulation and targeted adjunct therapies, Dr. Rinaldi can achieve proper alignment of your musculoskeletal structure - particularly the spine which allows your body to heal itself without surgery or medication. Focused manipulation is used to restore mobility to joints restricted by tissue injury caused by a traumatic event (such as falling or a motor vehicle accident), or repetitive stress (such as sitting without proper back support). At Amplify Chiropractic & Wellness, we take into account the many factors that can affect your health, including exercise, nutrition, sleep, environment and heredity. We focus on maintaining your health naturally to help your body resist disease, rather than simply treating the symptoms of disease.
