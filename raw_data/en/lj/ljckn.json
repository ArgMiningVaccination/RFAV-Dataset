The post in question dealt with one Michael J.

In truth, I probably let that thread go on far longer than I should have. Also, I probably should have banned Mr. Dochniak a couple of months ago for repeating the same arguments again and again and again after being thoroughly slapped down by my science-based readers again and again and again and again. But I didn't. And Mr. Dochniak is still not banned. Hopefully, given his level of discourse, he is not savvy enough to find this new post and thread, but you never know. Maybe he has a Google search set to his name. To all my regulars who took part in refuting Mr. Dochniak, I salute you. I couldn't do it and still write new posts. It just goes to show how a community can develop around a blog like this, and how I couldn't really do it anymore without you. "}
