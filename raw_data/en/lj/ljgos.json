For a complex disease such as cancer, a complex treatment regime that is well structured and multifactorial is indispensable. In the present day, Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) therapies are being used frequently for cancer, alongside modern biological therapies and allopathic medicine, in what is called integrative oncology. In all conscience, the use of natural, less invasive interventions whenever possible is ideal. However, a comprehensive understanding of not only the etiopathology of individual cancers, but also the detailed genetic and epigenetic characteristics, the cancer hallmarks, that clearly show the blueprint of the cancer phenotype is a requisite. Different tumors have a common behavioral pattern, but their specific features at the genetic and epigenetic levels vary to a great extent. Henceforth, with so many failed attempts to therapy, drug formulations and combinations need a focused pre-assessment of the inherent features of individual cancers to destroy the tumors holistically by targeting these features. This review therefore presents innocuous therapeutic regimes by means of CAM and integrative medicine approaches that can specifically target the hallmarks of cancer, using the case of cervical cancer.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2021-04-28", "cleaned_text": "Biological Therapy with Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Innocuous Integrative Oncology: A Case of Cervical Therapies]( /journal/pharmaceutics/special_issues/cancer_therapies )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [2](#B2-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. To minimize the occurrence of detrimental side effects and poor treatment outcomes, a team of health professionals including oncologists, physicians, surgeons, nurses and other allied health professionals perform a careful assessment of individual cases to develop the most logical therapeutic option. In the present day, this team of professionals now includes Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) specialists to integrate allopathic medicine with CAM for cancer treatment. This is commonly referred to as integrative medicine and has, in many studies, shown improved post-therapy quality of life than when allopathic medicine is used alone [ [3](#B3-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. [4](#B4-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. The increased attention given to CAM therapies now stems back from these ancient discoveries and, to date, there is a promising future in the use of these therapies, especially alongside standard treatments. In addition to CAM and as a part of alternatives to conventional chemo and radiation therapy, modern cancer research has focused on the use of biological therapies to remove tumors with the least risk of side effects. The application of these, requires a deep understanding of not only the etiopathology of cancer but also the genomic and epigenetic characteristics of the cancer to clearly describe its inherent features. Beyond the intrinsic characteristics of the cancer cells, other considerations at the tissue level including the tumor microenvironment and immune environment are important factors in tumor survival and consequently therapeutic outcome. Existing biological and physiological cancer therapies are being considered for integration with CAM and allopathic medicine, with the aim of maximizing tumor eradication while reducing side effects. [5](#B5-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. CaCx arises from neoplastic transformation of cells at the squamocolumnar junction after initial infection of the basal layer of the cervix by the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is well established as the main causative agent of CaCx, reported in nearly all of diagnosed cases [ [6](#B6-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. The integration of HPV into the host's cell genome leads to disruption of the normal cell cycle and immortalization. Since the first description of CaCx by Hippocrates, extensive studies have clarified the mechanisms of growth and maintenance of CaCx, and today CaCx is one of the few cancers whose etiopathology is exceptionally studied and understood. This knowledge has since provided very useful technologies for the prevention, diagnosis and management of the disease. 2. The Hallmarks of Cancer [Figure 1](#pharmaceutics-13-00626-f001)below are the hallmarks of cancer, characteristics of cancer cells that determine their survival and maintenance in the body. [7](#B7-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [8](#B8-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Furthermore, tumor cell maintenance has been explained by other colleagues including Otto Warburg, who in 1926 explained the metabolism of cancer cells using aerobic glycolysis [ [9](#B9-pharmaceutics-13-00626)], a phenomenon commonly referred to as \"the Warburg effect\", where energy is acquired form aerobic glycolysis through the increase in the rate of glucose uptake and preferential production of lactate [ [10](#B10-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [11](#B11-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. The microenvironment of tumor cells has also been extensively studied [ [12](#B12-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [13](#B13-pharmaceutics-13-00626)], and shown to be acidic, in which cancer cells tend to thrive better. In CaCx, the integration of the HPV genome into the host's genetic material is another important hallmark that has therapeutic implications [ [14](#B14-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Specific targeting of these characteristics, therefore, is essential in order to ensure maximum cancer eradication with minimal, if any, effect on normal cells. The following section therefore discusses cervical carcinogenesis to pinpoint the characteristics that can be targeted by CAM and biological therapies. 3. Cervical Carcinogenesis [15](#B15-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. [15](#B15-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. for Cervical Cancer [Figure 1](#pharmaceutics-13-00626-f001)above, it is evidently not easy to develop a therapy that completely destroys the tumor without affecting normal tissue. To date, the acceptability of approved therapies other than surgery depends on their capacity to reduce cancer growth at doses that have noticeable but with the least side effects. Although the decision for therapy is made having considered many variables including the size and shape of the tumor at diagnosis, the stage of the cancer, the woman's age and general medical conditions, the individual's desire to have children later in life, there are still numerous side effects during and after treatment. These have been substantially reviewed elsewhere [ [18](#B18-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [19](#B19-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [20](#B20-pharmaceutics-13-00626)] and summarized in [Table 1](#pharmaceutics-13-00626-t001)below. 4.1. Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Therapies [21](#B21-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. This definition denotes a very broad part of medicine that includes mind-body interventions, manipulative and body-based procedures, energy therapies, biologically-based treatments, and alternative medical systems. The common use of complementary therapies in oncology is not necessary with the attempt to cure but rather as supportive therapies and hence mainly used to alleviate symptoms of conventional therapy and also in palliative care. Shown in [Table 2](#pharmaceutics-13-00626-t002)below are common CAM therapies used as part of cancer therapy. [36](#B36-pharmaceutics-13-00626)] details of which are given in proceeding sections below. However, these need very careful administration when used alongside allopathic medicine, which is the case when treating cancer. When used alongside chemo agents, certain compounds in these natural products can affect how the drug works [ [37](#B37-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Additionally, cancer is a complex disease with many molecular processes that are responsible for the tumor phenotype and different compounds can slow down or speed up the cancer growth. Hence, a careful assessment is utterly important. In all conscience, for complex diseases such as cancer, even allopathic therapies to date have many limitations in eradicating the tumor. Likewise CAM therapies cannot be used alone to treat cancer. Therefore, integrative medicine is the common practice in the modern day, where CAM therapies are used alongside allopathic medicine to treat cancer. The correct use of integrative medicine enables a holistic approach to therapy that ensures that the body's innate healing response works together with medical interventions to effect on not only the disease but also the other aspect of the body, e.g., mind, spirit and overall health, things that do have so much influence on the outcome of mainstream therapies [ [38](#B38-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. 4.2. Biological Therapies [39](#B39-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [40](#B40-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. 4.2.1. Immunotherapies [41](#B41-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Immune checkpoints are therefore conveyed and represented by two different forms of signals including (1) co-stimulatory immune checkpoints, those that stimulate the progression of immune reactions, and (2) co-inhibitory immune checkpoints, those that inhibit the progression of immune reactions. Among the co-inhibitory immune checkpoints are cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), V-domain Ig suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA), lymphocyte-activation gene (LAG)-3 [ [42](#B42-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [43](#B43-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. [44](#B44-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. The cancer cells also change their antigen structures, downregulate important MHC molecules and/or secrete substance that suppress the action of the immune system. Most cancer cells including cervical, upregulate PD1 ligands which target the PD-1 on T cells, thereby suppressing the antitumor actions of T cells ( [Figure 3](#pharmaceutics-13-00626-f003)). Because of this observed phenomenon, immunotherapies have over the years been a commonly used biological therapy. The application of immunotherapies is therefore based on the principle that blocking or modulating the ligands and receptors that are necessary for the interaction of the cancer cell and immune cell for immune tolerance does prevent the cancer cell from evading the immune reaction. The immune checkpoints are initiated by ligand-receptor interactions that can be blocked using mAbs, or recombinant technology. 4.2.2. Oncolytic Virus (OV) Therapy [45](#B45-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. The OVs are genetically modified to achieve tumor selectivity plus oncolysis. Over the years, different types of OVs have been modified from viruses including the common Retroviruses, Paramyxoviruses, Adenoviruses and Herpes simplex viruses (HSV). laherparepvec (T-VEC), adenovirus, and an HSV, most OVs are still on the road to approval, currently in clinical trials and in vitro [ [46](#B46-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. [47](#B47-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. In the presence of such a response, the hormetic zone would refer to the range where there is an favorable biological response to low exposures with no effect at high doses. This means that the OVs injected in the body should not exceed the dose of the hormetic zone and that requires enough information about the tumor including tumor mass, site and features of its microenvironment. 4.2.3. Anticancer Vaccines [48](#B48-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. A common example is the sipuleucel-T vaccine for the prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) in prostate cancer, formerly approved by the American FDA [ [49](#B49-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [50](#B50-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. In the case of virally induced cancer including CaCx, viral proteins and oncoproteins can also be used as targets for therapeutic vaccines. However, hormesis as described previous is also an issue with the use of anticancer vaccines. 4.2.4. Targeted Therapies [51](#B51-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Certain immunological agents are also categorized as targeted therapies. A common targeted therapy that uses mAbs produced from a single clone of B lymphocyte, also called monoclonal antibody therapy, employs the principle of specific Ab binding to specific antigens and hence achieving directed/targeted tumor destruction specific enough to reduce severe side effects [ [52](#B52-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Because of the unique antigen-Ab interactions, the Abs can only recognize and bind to the cancer cell that has the corresponding antigen, leading to antitumor reactions by either blocking cell growth, preventing metastasis or inducing immunological reactions that cause cytotoxicity. These mAbs can be used alone due to their immunological nature, or can be used as carrier molecules for antitumor drugs, toxins, or radioactive materials directly to cancer cells [ [53](#B53-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. [53](#B53-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [54](#B54-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Pharmacologically, PDT uses not one, but two principles of selectivity and specificity to maximally target the tumor cells with no effect on distant organs and very minimal or rather negligible effects on surrounding cells [ [55](#B55-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [56](#B56-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. This phenomenon is so because PDT uses a couple of individual substances that are dependent on each other to attain reactivity, and these independent substance are administered separately. In the first step, a photosensitizing compound (photosensitizer or PS) is administered intravenously, intramuscularly or topically and given time to selectively localized in the tumor because of the tumors affinity to the drug. Once the drug has localized in the tumor, the second step involves light irradiation, usually using a laser, specifically directed at the tumor in a single beam. The light then activates the internalized drug and in the presence of tissue oxygen, cytotoxic oxygen species and radicals are formed, which destroy the tumor cells from within, and also from external effects upon destruction of the vasculature and activation of the immune system [ [54](#B54-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [55](#B55-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [56](#B56-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. The way PDT is delivered gives it not just one but two levels of specificity, where the PS is selectively localized in the tumor tissue, and light is only directed to the cancer region as shown in [Figure 4](#pharmaceutics-13-00626-f004)below. 2](#sec2-pharmaceutics-13-00626)are necessary for cancer maintenance and survival. Attacking these features using innocuous biological therapies and CAM not only maximizes therapeutic efficacy, but also minimizes the risk of side effects since these features are either not found on normal tissues, or are expressed differently. These features therefore provide many opportunities for designing therapies that have the highest potential in eradicating tumor cells. The section below reviews how these features can be targeted in CaCx. 5.1. Targeting the Genomic Instability [57](#B57-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [58](#B58-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. This mechanism is the common initiation step for most cancers and is a significant tool that has therapeutic implications. [59](#B59-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. During cervical tumorigenesis, many specific gene alterations directly related to the initial integration of HPV viral genome lead to a number of significantly mutated genes (SMGs) that provide data that are useful for designing gene-targeted therapies and immunotherapies. Most commonly affected genes in CaCx include HLA-A, Transforming Growth Factor Receptor 2 (TGFBR2), Caspase 8 (CASP8). These have prominent opportunities for therapy, for example the ERBB3 (HER3), which can be targeted using mAbs [ [60](#B60-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. [61](#B61-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [62](#B62-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [63](#B63-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. However, many issues regarding their applications, pharmacology and ethical implications have been debated for decades [ [64](#B64-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. The idea of gene therapies is to use a method that directly affects the function of a gene in order to archive a therapeutic target. Different ways of approaching gene therapy have been described especially those that use a viral vector [ [65](#B65-pharmaceutics-13-00626)], or nanoparticles [ [66](#B66-pharmaceutics-13-00626)] to effect cancer causing genes, e.g., p53, or to effect on immune T cells that boosts immune reaction against cancer also called immunogenic therapy. The constitutive role of HPV and its direct association with p53 and members of the RB gene suggests the use of gene therapies [ [67](#B67-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Because of the restricted access to genetic material in the body and the fact that most cancers are noted during the progression and advanced stages, targeting the genetic material can be somewhat problematic unless in cases where screening results in the confirmation of mutations at the initiation stage before acquisition of alterations in SMGs. However, these mutations lead to the impairment of molecular activities of the cell, the stage at which other therapeutic regimes can have much effect, as describe in the following section. 5.2. Targeting Cell Signaling [24](#B24-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. 5.2.1. Wnt Signaling Pathway [65](#B65-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Activation of the Wnt signaling pathway leads to a series of events that culminate to the accumulation of b-catenin in the cytoplasm, which promotes its entrancement to the nucleus, finally activating the transcription of c-myc and cyclin D. Although it is not feasible to target the Wnt/b-catenin pathway using a single forward approach due to its complexity and the varying associated conduits within the pathway, numerous compounds with significant effects on the pathway are available. Naturally occurring polyphenols attenuate Wnt/b-catenin signaling via the induction of cellular degradation of the b-catenin alongside a reduction in the nuclear accumulation of b-catenin. The advantage of polyphenols is that they are abundant in nature, are found in a variety of foods and can be extracted and used with less alteration. These compounds have both defensive and therapeutic properties against most tumors. In CaCx, polyphenols have been qualified for the sensitization of cancer cells to chemo and radiation [ [23](#B23-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Polyphenols are categorized using five separate subgroups namely phenolic acids, curcuminoids flavonoids, stilbenes, and lignans. Specific mAbs and peptides directed against different parts of the Wnt/b-catenin pathway can be used [ [66](#B66-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. For the purpose of maximally effecting on this pathway therefore, an integrative approach using nutraceutical containing polyphenols and mAb therapy can potentially produce better outcomes. To date, there are no reported cases of a possible antagonistic mechanism between natural polyphenols and mAbs. 5.2.2. EGFR/VEGF Pathway [68](#B68-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Because of its role in neoangiogenesis, this pathway is vital for tumor maintenance and metastasis. Opportunely, there are numerous EGFR/VEGF blockers that effectively target components of this pathway in use, in clinical trials and in vitro. Bevacizumab is an FDA-approved CaCx targeted therapeutic agent for the treatment of advanced/metastic CaCx, and recurrent disease [ [69](#B69-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [70](#B70-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. This drug is a recombinant humanized mAb, that immunologically targets VEGF-A in the EGFR/VEGF pathway. Bevacizumab has been used for CaCx treatment in many clinical trials that led to its approval, and continues to be used, with good patient prognosis despite its high toxicity levels in some cases according to expert opinion. A tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), pazopanib also directly affects VEGF and is currently used for renal cell carcinoma and other soft-tissue tumors though not currently approved for CaCx [ [71](#B71-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [72](#B72-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. [72](#B72-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Other TIKs at Erlotinib, Matuzumab and Gefitinib. Nimotuzumab is a mAb that shows very significant anti-EGFR activity and has been studied in many CaCx clinical trials, with promising results in limiting the progression of cancer [ [73](#B73-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. A similar drug in action, Cetuximab, a chimeric mAb that blocks this pathway by binding to the receptor causing it dimerization and downregulation, also has promising anticancer effects [ Pathway [75](#B75-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. [76](#B76-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. However, unlike Wm, LY294002 possesses a very short life span with a higher off-target activity and high toxicity, which restricts its clinical application. Several naturally occurring compounds have anti-PI3K/Akt activity. Common ones include, genistein found in Soy Streptomyces hygroscopicus, which targets and inhibits a downstream component of the PI3K/Akt pathway known as the mammalian target of rapamycin [77](#B77-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [78](#B78-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. 5.2.4. Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK Signaling Pathway [79](#B79-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. EGF also plays an important role in the activation of this pathway, leading to tumorigenesis and tumor maintenance. Briefly, EGF-associated complexes involving RAF lead to the induction of MEK1 and MEK2, which in turn phosphorylate and activate ERK1 and ERK2. Eventually, ERK1/2 acts on a vast number of cell regulator substrates in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, including cell cycle kinases, transcription factors and gene expression. In addition, Raf family members are upstream activators of the ERK, which, when activated, induce the signaling of ERK1/2 [ [80](#B80-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. With so many intermediate signal regulators in Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling comes numerous inhibitor molecules that can be directed at different stages of this pathway. Highly specific MEK1/2 inhibitors are under review including ERK1/2 antisense oligonucleotides, PD98059 and U0126 [ [81](#B81-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. The first inhibits ERK1/2 protein expression and reduces its concentration in the cell and the other two inhibitors suppress ERK1/2 phosphorylation without changing the concentration of ERK1/2 in the cell. Because Raf is an important upstream regulator, drugs that inhibit Raf, e.g., BAY43-9006 and Sorafenib, are being considered for treating CaCx. Importantly, since the EGF is an important regulator for this pathway, drugs that inhibit EGFR are similarly useful in preventing activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, which includes the possible incorporation of the nutraceuticals previously described. 5.3. Targeting Immune Evasion [44](#B44-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. At present, mAbs against CTLA4 are used for treatment of certain cancers in most countries and blockers of PD1 are very close to being approved because of the many clinical trials that have shown promising results. As shown previously, PD-L1 molecules on the cancer cells stop the T cell from killing the cancer cell by attaching to the PD-1, a protein on the surface of T cells [ [82](#B82-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. With immune checkpoint inhibitors, ligands to prevent the action on PD-L1 are used to activate T cells by blocking the PD-1 on the surface of the T cells. A novel PD-1 checkpoint blocker used for most cancers including CaCx, called Pembrolizumab, has shown promising results for treatment of recurrent tumors [ [83](#B83-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [84](#B84-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. While nutraceuticals and mAbs inhibit angiogenesis at the molecular level, PDT can cause damage to intact blood vessels via its cytotoxicity. Targeted therapies including PDT and mAb therapy have also been useful in effecting cytotoxicity and tissue damage. [85](#B85-pharmaceutics-13-00626)] studied the cytos 7ine-phosphate-guanosine oligodeoxynucleotide and demonstrated that this vaccine had substantial effects on systemic immune responses and the tumor microenvironment (TME) in a mouse model of cervical cancer. Their results indicated a significant increase in interferon (IFN)--producing CD4 and CD8 T cells and tumor-infiltrating CD4 and CD8 T cells. Additionally, there was a marked decrease in splenic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), regulatory T Angiogenesis [86](#B86-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [87](#B87-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. In most cases, angiogenesis inhibitors have also been used alongside conventional chemo and radiation therapies. In addition to these combinations, inhibition synergism can also be achieved by the integration of a mAb and certain nutraceuticals. Such compounds include but are not limited to the polyphenols previously described, curcumin and epigallocatechin-3-gallate from green tea [ [88](#B88-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. The integrative medicine approach using angiogenesis inhibitors and nutraceuticals has previously been examined [ [89](#B89-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Although there is limited understanding of the pharmacological interactions between these two regimes, their combination for a possible synergistic action is pertinent. [90](#B90-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. This technique has the most potential for the least side effects, if any, since the vaccine can only induce an immune response specifically targeting the mutated cancer cells without cross effects on normal cells unless there is a secondary impact. 5.5. Targeting Oncoproteins [91](#B91-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [92](#B92-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. The E6 and E7 oncoproteins have been studied substantially and have been shown to localize inside the cell in high concentrations, the site and concentration of which depends on many factors including the stage of cell cycle and cell confluence in vitro. The presence of the E6 and E7 oncoproteins in the nucleus, perinuclear region, cytoplasm and cell membrane, provides an opportunity for targeting using mAbs, therapeutic vaccines and nutraceutical described previous [ [93](#B93-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. 5.6. Targeting the Tumor Microenvironment [94](#B94-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. [95](#B95-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Visser et al. [ [96](#B96-pharmaceutics-13-00626)] examined the frequencies, phenotype and activity of (Tregs) in patients with cervical neoplasia and showed that both CIN and cervical cancer patients had increased Tregs in the peripheral blood. In the tumor microenvironment, these cells interfere with the action of the immune system by suppressing antigen-presenting cells (APCs) through depletion of immune-stimulating cytokines followed by the expression of CTLA-4, which inhibits the APCs [ [97](#B97-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Additionally, they also limit the efficiency of cancer immunotherapy. Using anti-CTLA-4 antibodies including ipilimumab (FDA approved for treatment of advanced melanoma) effectively reduces the action and number of Tregs in the blood, with subsequent activation of cytotoxic T cells [ [98](#B98-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Although there are no approved anti-CTLA-4-Treg inhibitors for CaCx to date, the presence of Tregs in HPV-induced cancers including CaCx, suggests the use of monoclonal antibodies to act as check point inhibitors in CaCx, but this remains to be an area of research [ [99](#B99-pharmaceutics-13-00626), [100](#B100-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. Ji et al investigated the combination of radiotherapy and suppression of Tregs in rectal cancer and observed that this dual approach enhanced the efficacy of therapy with inhibition of metastasis [ [101](#B101-pharmaceutics-13-00626)]. 5.7.
