He utilizes knowledge from a number of different modalities and schools of thought to base his information on including Historical Use and Folklore; Herbal; Aromatherapy; Anthroposophy; Traditional Chinese Medicine; Homeopathy and the Jewish Kabbalah. His information is further based on the homeopathic concept of Miasms; the Anthroposophical concepts of the Three Fold Organism and Constitutional Elements of humans and the Kabbalah Tree of Life and its 10 Sefirot. Today I am highlighting the next sefirah, Malkhut. Malkhut is the receptacle for the gathered forces of Yesod. It is the Sefirah of the world of phenomena and earthly being, the physical palace of God. In its highest manifestation, it is the Creator's Presence, exhibiting itself to us as the female aspect known as the Shekhinah. It has the attributes of Sovereignty and Kingdom and is associated with the female Reproductive organs, the Lower Mother, the Seventh Day of Creation, the Moon and the Desire to Receive. In her book, Kabbalah of Prayer, Shulamit Elson says \"Malkhut is the mirror of Keter, a place where the glory of the Creator, the purely spiritual and ineffable, is received and projected as the material manifestation of reality and then reflected back to Keter itself. While Keter sits above the head of Adam Kadmon, Malkhut lies just beneath the torso.\" Malkhut is the gateway through which the Or Ein Sof, originating in the Infinite and shaped by the higher Sefirot, flowers from the hidden, inner-realm of pure potential into the outer, material world. Malkhut not only sustains us in the material world but serves as the point of embarkation for ascent to the non-material realm of unitary and enlightenment. The light which emanates from Malkhut is reflected light, which is one of the reasons why it is associated with the moon. For this reason, it is portrayed in images of privation and darkness. Malkhut is the only Sefirah that does not emanate light itself, but rather receives the light from the Sefirot above. Malkhut is the Sefirah closest to us, and it is our starting point for the return to God. All colors are contained in Malkhut, it is associated with the planet Earth, the astrological sign of Aries (March 21 - April 20) and the Archangel Sandalphon, Angel of Prayer and Life.
