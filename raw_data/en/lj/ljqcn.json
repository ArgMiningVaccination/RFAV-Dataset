Contemporary clinical trials have also shown significant improvement on a number of diseases, as evidenced by a great amount of peer-reviewed papers published in prestigious medical journals such as Lancet. Actually, the World Health Organization (WHO) has concluded that 31 diseases/disorders can be effectively treated by acupuncture, based on controlled clinical trials reported in the recent scientific literature. Click [here](http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/pdf/s4926e/s4926e.pdf) for more information about the WHO's review and report. Heat Therapy uses special medical heat lamps designed for acupuncture to apply heat to the areas where needles are inserted. The heat warms the needles and transmits the warmth inside the body. It also acts to bring down inflammation and increase circulation. The heat is relaxing for the patient, making it easier to rest during treatment. Electro-Acupuncture is when the acupuncture needles are inserted and then attached to a small device that puts out a tiny electrical current. This current runs through the needles and increases the efficacy of the treatment. It feels like a light pulse and is not painful or uncomfortable. It acts to increase the strength of the treatment. Auricular acupuncture, or ear acupuncture, is a diagnostic and treatment system based on normalizing the body's dysfunction through stimulation of points on the ear. It is based on the idea that the ear is a microsystem which reflects the entire body represented on the auricle. Moxibustion is a form of heat therapy in which dried herbal materials called \"moxa\" are burned on or very near the surface of the skin. The intention is to warm and invigorate the flow of Qi in the body and dispel certain pathogenic influences. Cupping is an ancient Chinese method of causing local congestion. A partial vacuum is created in cups placed on the skin either by means of heat or suction. It mobilizes blood flow in order to promote healing. In our clinic, following conditions can be treated effectively by acupuncture: Acupuncture works by helping the body to heal itself. It stimulates one's natural and internal resources, healing from the inside-out. Our bodies produce a wide range of natural pain-relieving substances, natural anti-inflammatory chemistry, hormones, immune system enhancers, and so forth, all without the need for outside drugs. In fact, some of our most effective drugs are man-made synthetic copies of the chemicals our bodies make naturally, such as cortisone. However, usually we don't utilize our full inside self-healing resources, just like only a fraction of our brains' potential is used at any given time. Acupuncture helps us squeeze more out of our natural ability to heal ourselves - to get us closer to our full potential. A well-trained acupuncturist can perform a series of treatments to give a good boost to the self-healing resources, which will make the difference needed to help our bodies to finish the job. Acupuncture originated in China and is one of the oldest and most commonly used natural traditional medicine in the world - dating back at least 3,000 years. Based on traditional Chinese medicine and meridian theory, acupuncture stimulates specific points on the body to normalize physiological function, modify the perception of pain, and treat certain disorders of the body. The stimulation may be produced by needles, heat, local pressure, electrical currents, or other means, but most frequently by needling. Meridian theory in Traditional Chinese Medicine emphasizes the connection among acu-points, and considers the human body -holistically (mind, body, and soul). Not only does acpuncture treat the presenting symptoms, but the underlying cause of the conditions.
