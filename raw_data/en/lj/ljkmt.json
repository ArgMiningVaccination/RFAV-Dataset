These toxins force the muscles to remain rigid.

DT/tD (Diphtheria and Tetanus), DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus and acellular Pertussis), and TDaP, all protect you from tetanus as well as other infectious diseases such as diphtheria Vaccine Safety5 Reviews of VAERS reports associated with [DTaP](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/dtap-tdap-vaccine.html) and [TDaP](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X09007403?via%3Dihub) vaccines found the vaccines to be safe. Studies looked into some specific neurological problems or seizures and found no association between these complications and the vaccines. If you are unsure about vaccine safety, you should always speak with your doctor about any potential risks. Vaccine Effectiveness Thanks to improved hygiene and the introduction of tetanus vaccinations, reported tetanus cases have dropped significantly since the 1950s. Vaccines are most effective as long as individuals receive the recommended number of doses as well as regular boosters. The CDC estimates that tetanus vaccines virtually have 100% effectiveness in preventing tetanus in individuals who have follow dosage and booster recommendations. Vaccine Schedules6 DTaP Vaccine Schedule dT Vaccine Schedule TDaP Vaccine Schedule TD Vaccine Schedule Which vaccine should I get? This depends on multiple factors, such as your age, pre-existing medical conditions, and pregnancy status. Speak with your physician about options and recommendations. How do I know if I am protected against tetanus? Your vaccination records are the best way of knowing if you have been vaccinated. If these records cannot be found, your doctor may perform a blood test. Speak with your doctor if you are unsure about your immune status. Types of tetanus vaccines7 Many different manufacturers produce many different vaccines to protect from not only tetanus, but also several other infectious diseases as well.

Always speak with your doctor about concerns you may have. Injection site redness or rash Fever Joint or muscle stiffness Injection site pain or soreness Severe Allergic Reactions In very rare cases, severe allergic reactions have been observed. Let your doctor know if you have ever experienced any allergic reactions to vaccines.
