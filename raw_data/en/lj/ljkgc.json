This is a review for alternative medicine in Temecula, CA: \"I have finally found the most awesome Doctor. After nearly 20 years of dealing with autoimmune issues that never seemed to be addressed, I have answers. Doctor Briggs is amazing, she knows her stuff and she cares. The offices at the Briggs Institute are comfortable and crisp. The staff is on point and very nice. There is a Phlebotomist on site, which is very handy. She does take a myriad of different insurances, a quick phone call can determine which. I am glad mine is accepted, but I would stay with her even if it wasn't. She has helped me greatly. Thank you Dr. Briggs, I feel better now than I have "}
