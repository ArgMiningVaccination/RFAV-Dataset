And even harder to find effective ones that don't cost a fortune. That's why I'm really excited to share one of my favorite natural deodorant recipes with you! It stops odor, keeping me smelling fresh & clean all day. It's a super easy and cheap DIY made with essential oils and milk of magnesia. Yep, just 2 ingredients. But it REALLY DOES WORK. Why I love this deodorant - super cheap \u2014 least expensive natural deodorant I've ever bought or made. One bottle of milk of magnesia only costs about $3 and lasts me 3-5 months. - incredibly easy to make \u2014 just pour essential oil and milk of magnesia into a bottle and shake. That's it! It takes less than 1 minute to make. - effective \u2014 it really works! It stops odor before it starts. No more stink. This keeps me smelling fresh & clean all day long. - natural - I love eliminating harsh chemicals and toxins from my home. And deodorant is one of the best places to start. Store-bought deodorant can be full of so many damaging chemicals (like aluminum, parabens, pesticides, and other carcinogens). - no baking soda or other harsh ingredients - I have sensitive skin in general, and my underarms are even more sensitive. Baking soda can cause my skin to turn red and break out in a rash of bumpy, prickly discomfort. So I love that this deodorant doesn't have baking soda, and that it is gentle on my sensitive skin.

This is the same milk of magnesia that's generally used as a laxative. Turns out, it's also an excellent deodorant! Just be sure to look for a natural milk of magnesia ( [like this](http://amzn.to/2GBxEqe)). Some brands have added bleach, and of course, you don't want to be putting bleach onto your underarm skin. yuck! You can [find it online here](http://amzn.to/2FBMeNa)or at stores like Dollar General, Krogers, Walgreens, and CVS. Check the ingredients list before purchasing to confirm that it doesn't have bleach (sodium hypochlorite). - essential oils (see below for a list of great essential oil combinations for making natural deodorant) - funnel - for roll-on deodorant (option 1): large 30 ml roller bottle (find them [here](http://amzn.to/2Evzt7F)or [here](http://amzn.to/2FBcS8X)) - for spray deodorant (option 2): 4 oz spray bottle - look for one with a [great trigger sprayer like this](http://amzn.to/2DTfpLo)so that the deodorant sprays easily. Because you'll be using essential oils in this deodorant, use either a glass spray bottle or a type of plastic that's safe for diluted essential oils (PET plastic #1 or HDPE plastic #2) Why does milk of magnesia work so well for deodorant? Milk of magnesia (MOM) is generally used as a laxative, but when it's used topically, it turns out it is also an excellent natural deodorant. Why is that? It's because milk of magnesia is made of magnesium hydroxide suspended in water, and magnesium has excellent antibacterial and antimicrobial properties. It's the magnesium that works so well as a deodorant. It inhibits bacteria from growing on your underarms. And since it's bacteria that causes stink and body odor, if there isn't bacteria, then there isn't stink or body odor. Magnesium works so well as a deodorant that some people will use [magnesium oil (magnesium chloride)](http://amzn.to/2DUBYiI) as their deodorant. If you're not sensitive to magnesium chloride, then this can be another great option. But many people find this too strong, and using magnesium oil straight irritates their underarms causing stinging, redness, and itching. Diluting magnesium into a cream (like my [magnesium cream deodorant - recipe here](https://oneessentialcommunity.com/diy-essential-oil-deodorant-really-works/) or my [calming magnesium body butter - recipe here](https://oneessentialcommunity.com/calming-magnesium-body-butter-essential-oils/)) is a great way to lessen these negative effects. Which essential oils are good for making natural DIY deodorant? With their antibacterial and antimicrobial properties and pleasant scents, many essential oils are great for making natural deodorant. Here are some of my favorites: - lavender - clary sage - geranium - cedarwood - cypress - lemongrass - eucalyptus - tea tree - coriander - sandalwood - patchouli - peppermint or spearmint - citrus essential oils like bergamot, lemon, lime, tangerine, orange, and grapefruit (don't use if your skin will be exposed to the sun, because citrus essential oils can cause photosensitivity) 15 Essential oil blends for making DIY deodorant Even more fun than just using a single essential oil is making your own custom essential oil blend. Do you have a favorite deodorant scent? Here are some of mine. There are a mix of scents that are floral, woodsy, crisp & clean, bright & sunny \u2014 find one that you love and then use it in the recipes below. - eucalyptus and lemongrass - lavender and clary sage - cedarwood and juniper berry - bergamot and lime - lavender and bergamot - lavender, lime, and spearmint - lavender, cedarwood, tea tree, lemon, and eucalyptus - coriander, lemongrass, lavender, tea tree, and cypress - ylang ylang and frankincense - lime, vetiver, and lemongrass - sandalwood, patchouli, and cypress - basil, cypress, orange, and rosemary - coriander, cypress, geranium, and ylang ylang - orange and eucalyptus - lavender and vanilla (there isn't vanilla essential oil, but [vanilla oleoresin like this](http://amzn.to/2FBLDv6)works well) option 1: How to make essential oil roll-on deodorant step 1: use a funnel to fill a large 30ml roller bottle most of the way full with milk of magnesia tip: see the supplies section above for where to find great natural milk of magnesia without any added toxin ingredients step 2: add 5-6 drops of essential oil tip: see above for some essential oil combinations that are great for making natural deodorant step 3: put the rollerball on and shake to mix well tip: make sure it is snapped down securely option 2: How to make essential oil spray deodorant step 1: use a funnel to fill a 4 ounce spray bottle most of the way full with milk of magnesia tip: see the supplies section above for where to find great natural milk of magnesia without any added toxin ingredients tip: because you'll be adding essential oils, be sure to use a glass spray bottle or a plastic spray bottle made from PET #1 plastic or HDPE #2 plastic step 2: add 15-20 drops of essential oil tip: see above for some essential oil combinations that are great for making natural deodorant step 3: put on the spray top and shake well How to use - start with clean and dry underarms - roll or spray on - allow to dry for 30 seconds or so before putting on shirt - reapply as needed note: This a not an antiperspirant.
