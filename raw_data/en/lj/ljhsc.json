HiPAM: COVID -19 FORECAST MODELS Director Victoria Fan, Thomas Blamey and Dr. Monique Chyba of Hawai i Pandemic Applied Modeling (HiPAM) provided the committee with the current forecast on COVID -19 transmission and other relevant data. Honolulu is experiencing an increase in test positivity and a decrease in the number of tests being administered indicating that there is likely a large underreporting of cases. Forecast models also indicated that hospitalization on O ahu for COVID -19 would surpass by 500 by September 13 (448 individuals were hospitalized as of Friday, September 3). There is a risk of a flu and COVID -19 co -occurring epidemic this fall. Waning vaccine efficacy and increased susceptible population will increase transmission of COVID -19. Impacts of the coronavirus on pregnant women and children can be long -lasting due to development impacts, not only of COVID -19 but also from co -occurring stress, economic and educational conditions. Risk of ongoing variants that are not preventable by vaccine. DEPARTMENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL: ENFORCING COVID -19 VIOLATIONS Attorney General Clare Conners provided the committee with information on her department's effort to enforce the current Safe Travel's program for visitors. Seven individuals have been arrested who entered the state using fraudulent vaccination cards and 60 individu- als for violating quarantine rules. Over 4,000 compliance checks have been conducted since the beginning of the pandemic. Lack of personnel available to help with enforcement efforts DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATION OF HAWAI I: HOSPITAL CAPACITY AND OXYGEN Hilton Raethel of the Health Care Association of Hawai i (HAH) and Dr. Libby Char of the Department of the Health provided the committee with information regarding the State's hospital capacity and the current medical oxygen situation. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is deploying 650 registered nurses, respiratory therapists and other technicians to healthcare facilities across the State. Most of these personnel will be in Hawai i by mid - September. There is a staffing shortage in long -term health (LTC) care facilities, assisted living facilities, home healthcare and hospice care. To address this issue, HAH presented a $10,628,000 proposal for an eight -week deployment of 242 post -acute personnel to increase capacity at various facilities statewide. HAH is currently seeking funding for this proposal. FEMA has tentatively approved a request from the State Department of Health (DOH) to provide six teams to support subcutaneous monoclonal antibody (MOAB) treatment at various hospitals, which can be used for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID -19 symptoms and help to limit the number of hospitalizations for indi- viduals with COVID -19. The State's two oxygen producers, Matheson and Air Gas Hawai i are operating at maximum capacity. Demand for medical oxygen has increased significantly due to the number of individuals hospitalized with COVID - 19. While oxygen conservation measures are being implemented statewide, there is enough medical oxygen in the State to meet the demand should Hawaii reach its peak of cases in the coming weeks. Hospitals are near the point where they may not be able to provide ICU care for all patients needing it; leaving patients with the possibility of not receiving the optimal level of care that they need.
