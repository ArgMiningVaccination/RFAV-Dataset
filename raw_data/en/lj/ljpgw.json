Open doors, release energies that are blocking you and gain clarity about negative self-beliefs with a Psychic Healing.", "sitename": "kasamba.com", "date": "2016-01-01", "cleaned_text": "Spiritual healing is our birthright - to feel better and more at one with the world, to find appreciation for the single biggest opportunity the Universe has given us - that of being alive, being here and now, in this wonderful moment in time. Unlike what most people assume, this is in fact the best time to be alive, compared to any other era in the past. Many doors have opened - doors that were thought to be permanently closed. Today, psychics can openly and freely offer their services without being burnt for witchcraft, and seekers can openly search for the Truth, trying different spiritual methods. All is possible. But even this hopeful setting, we lose hope. It is easy to get stressed out by unpaid bills, feel abandoned and unwanted by lovers who don't return our calls, get annoyed by our mother's comments, or get destabilized by toxic coworkers. Spiritual healing helps us get firmly grounded and stronger in our core, so that whatever happens outside of us is perceived by us as fleeting and completely manageable events. We can't stop life's events. Life means movement, positive and negative. Life means change. When we transform in the soul level, none of life's vicissitudes gets to us. A spiritually well person will still feel all the negative emotions, such as anger, hatred, jealousy, and sadness. But won't get carried away by them. Won't identify with them, but rather treat them as passing endeavors. Welcome them as guests, who will come and go. Accept them as such, embrace them while they are there, and then let go. This is exactly what spiritual healing does - help us be bigger, stronger than our emotions. But not deny them. Accept life's events that are outside of us, but not let them define us. Understand that our present situation does not have to shape our future. No matter how much we strive to change, some of us are just really sensitive. We find it very difficult to tune out the influences of others, or the environment. This is actually a more psychic issue than a spiritual one. We all know people who suck the energy out of us every time we see them. Those are energy vampires engaging in subtle psychic attacks. For this kind of psychic healing to last, we must attend to our deeper soul - always. This can include spiritual brain training, i.e. retraining our minds to think more positively, to stop attacking ourselves with our own thoughts. To be there for ourselves in the deepest sense possible, we must be mindful of the different aspects of our healing process - emotions, thoughts, and bad energies around us. One way to make ourselves more spiritually evolved and strong is to work with spirit guides. Our spirit guides accompany us throughout all our years and they can guide us to a better inner place anytime we contact them. An advisor with psychic healing powers and who can contact the spirit world can be your best friend during this time. On our own, what we can do is limited, not because we are not attentive or knowledgeable, but because only in the mirror of another we recognize more of our own traits, desirable and undesirable. Others are meant to walk by our side as we move forward. We let go of those forcefully trying to control our direction, voicing suggestions when we didn't ask, or those who try to hold us back. We keep only those who can be by our side, as we make new choices every day. A good psychic healing practitioner will show you newer and more things on your road, but the choice to go forward or change your direction will remain yours. Sometimes when we talk about a situation we casually or carelessly make statements, such as \"oh I hate myself for this,\" or \"oh no, I shouldn't complain.\" These are our underlying beliefs. They are \"script\" statements that we don't challenge. A good psychic healer will point them to you. They will show you that there is a difference between your subjective beliefs and the objective reality. Because, who says we can't complain? Or, why should you hate yourself for anything you might have done? Good psychic healers also sense and see our energy. Sometimes we pretend we are fine when we are not. Or we act all strong when we're falling apart inside. Some of these behaviors are defense mechanisms we've been employing since childhood. A good healer will help us realize how hard we work on our facades when we should really work on our inner, real face. There are many psychic healers on Kasamba.
