MMR VACCINE So in order for my 5 year old to start kinder I have to do the MMR vaccine. I have been trying to avoid it for so long. Now we have to. My question is what can I do give her in order to decrease the side effects. I'm so scared of these vaccines. They are combing chicken pox to it as well. Any advice will be greatly appreciated!! [20+ Similar Discussions Found](//www.whattoexpect.com/search?tab=community&q=MMR+VACCINE) can you get an exemption form where you're from? if you are still tying to avoid it while you gather more info, see about an exemption to buy yourself the time Side effects from vaccines are extremely rare. They are mostly mild and include fever, aches at the injection site etc. The risks of getting the vaccines are orders of magnitude lower than the risks of side effects from the diseases they prevent. @love being a mommy, Side effects are rare and usually very mild. Have Tylenol on hand about a week later in case of fever. Measles is one of the most infectious diseases known to man and particularly dangerous for children. It is really important to protect your child. Just went through this! I'm working with a naturopath who recommended the following: Prior to shot and continuing for at least 30 days post shot: daily probiotic (recommend megaspore or Bio K) and cod liver oil (recommend Rosita) (probiotic supports and protects gut health and the cod liver oil has vitamin A which helps their immune system fight the virus). Also silvercilin (recommend Designs for Health) helps with immune function. Day of shot: extra vitamin C (kiwis, fresh oranges or orange juice, also liposomal vitamin C (recommend quicksilver scientific)), right after shot put paste of bentonite clay and water on injection (helps keep the heavy metal mercury and aluminum preservatives out of their bloodstream), then immediately put ice pack on injection site. When you get home you can give babe a detox bath with epsom salt, apple cider vinegar. The measles vaccine is live and \"sheds\" in their poo for up to 30 days. So take extra care with that. Continue the extra vitamin C with the cod liver oil and probiotics. My naturopath said making popsicles out of the fresh orange juice or other high C source would be fun for LO. Look up proper dosages for all things based on weight. Hope this helps! I also asked my Dr to only do MMR and scheduled the chicken pox and other scheduled vaccines in one month after MMR. very helpful information! Thank you. you're awesome!!! haha. No worries at all and they are so cute. I'm sorry, I totally arsed up your username in my post. hippo to be square is fun too though, right? Lol they are awfully cute. you're absolutely right. I need to update that list but I've been lazy. The list saved on my phone and was compiled by another user. I totally respect anyone's right to seek out homeopathy as a supplement to western medicine if they can afford it. I think my issue with your initial post is the implication (though not explicitly stated, I recognize) that MMR is not safe without these interventions. You're absolutely right, a modest dose of vitamin C and probiotics aren't going to be harmful, but they probably aren't going to do much other than cost you money. They don't make vaccines safer than they already are, or they'd be universally recommended. As well, you do make somewhat anti-vaccine statements in your initial post, which would absolutely serve to scare someone who was uninformed away from vaccinating their kids, like \"right after shot put paste of bentonite clay and water on injection (helps keep the heavy metal mercury and aluminum preservatives out of their bloodstream)\". As was already pointed out by @hippotobesquare, these are not MMR ingredients. Vaccines are not injected into the blood stream, and even if they were, a clay and water compress is going to do nothing to remove it. Removing material from blood needs things like dialysis or plasmapheresis, not clay on the skin. Finally, did you have a chance to read the 50 studies from that Vaccine Safety Commission document? I will admit, I did not read them all. I did click a few at random, though - the first one that I clicked was not actually about vaccines - it was about exposure to environmental toxins like vehicle emissions being a potential contributor to autism. The next one I clicked was about vaccines, but the authors recommend that families continue to vaccinate as per the CDC guidelines. Another discussed a possible association between Thimerosol in DtaP and higher risk for an ASD diagnosis, when from everything I understand, the only vaccine that still contains thimerosal is the multi-dose vials of flu vaccine (and you can easily request a different form of this not containing thimerosal if you are that worried about it). And weren't we just talking about MMR? It's also generally accepted in academic communities that only studies done in the last 5 years should be strongly considered. Only the first 11 studies on this list are recent. I guess what I'm saying is that the Vaccine Safety Commission was rather scraping the bottom of the barrel to put this list together, and probably hoping/assuming that most people would just say, \"wow, 50 peer-reviewed studies? I'm going to trust that this is all legit and supports the poster's argument\". There is a whole lot more current research out there that should be looked at first. To be fair, many of @hippotobesquare's list is pretty out of date, too - but they are at least applicable to the discussion. If you are truly pro-vaccine, and I believe you when you say you are, please be mindful of the language that you use around them. I agree that homeopathy is not going to harm your child, but not everyone can afford this extra stuff and visits to alternative practitioners - please don't scare them into thinking they need it. You're right, we all want what's best for our kids, and keeping infectious disease at bay is the best (and greenest!) thing out there. sorry but the vaccine safety commission is not a reputable source of information. As someone with a me as level IQ should be able to understand. I would think. I e read through some of the \"studies\" posted in your copied info from this extremely biased source and many of them have absolutely nothing to do with what you think they do. If you'd taken the time to read them for yourself instead of just copying and pasting from a propaganda site you might know that. Hi, here are 50 peer-reviewed studies to consider: [https://vaccinesafetycommission.org/pdfs/50-Studies.pdf](//vaccinesafetycommission.org/pdfs/50-Studies.pdf) I'm certainly not trying to scare anyone out of vaccinating their children, but I do disagree with your statements. you said \"heavy metal mercury\" was in vaccines. You also said that the body needs help \"detoxing\" them. These things are all blatantly false. They may cause a person to be fearful of a life-saving vaccine. I'm an environmental scientist. Oh dear, we clearly have a misunderstanding here. I'm not sure what \"harmful misinformation\" I have provided, but it seems you are deeply triggered by something I said. Probiotics, cod liver oil, and vitamin C from oranges and kiwi are pretty innocuous immune system support suggestions. Again, I fully appreciate vaccinations and only posted what I believe to be holistic support of their important health benefits. BTW, what are your credentials? let me get this straight, you have a Mensa IQ and you cannot write a grammatically correct sentence? You have a Mensa IQ and lack a very basic understanding of how vaccines work? Your initial response to this post indicated that you lack even a high school level understanding of science. Okay. I was not trying to be negative I was trying to correct the misinformation you were spreading on the internet which is indeed harmful should someone follow that advice. I'm glad you've got lots of cash to throw away on quackery. FYI the fever that develops after a vaccine is the body's immune response, it's not an actual viral infection. Hello @hipptobesquare You are of course welcome to have your opinions on the matter, as am I. Nothing I shared in my post is harmful and regardless of the vaccine would be helpful to anyone's immune response, especially to an injected foreign matter. I'm a big believer in vaccinations and am so thankful for the protection they provide against horrific diseases. Not sure why you responded with such negativity. We are all mamas trying to do the best we can for our babes. Have a great evening. Your comments on the vaccine not making the recipient sick contradicts what my son's (western medicine) pediatrician said, which is that he may develop a fever and/or rash 14+ days after the injection - and that this is \"normal.\" Regarding your financial advice - I have a Mensa IQ, am a CFO, and am financially savvy.. so can spare the expense of various medical opinions. \"naturopath who recommended the following\" This is all whoey. If someone recommends this to you, back away slowly and never return. \"Prior to shot and continuing for at least 30 days post shot: daily probiotic (recommend megaspore or Bio K) and cod liver oil (recommend Rosita) (probiotic supports and protects gut health and the cod liver oil has vitamin A which helps their immune system fight the virus).\" The body doesn't have to fight the virus and the virus cannot make you sick. It is only a portion of the virus so the body develops an immune response without having to be sick. \"Also silvercilin (recommend Designs for Health) helps with immune function.\" No help is needed. The body is perfectly capable. \"right after shot put paste of bentonite clay and water on injection (helps keep the heavy metal mercury and aluminum preservatives out of their bloodstream)\" First of all there is no mercury in vaccines and they don't go into the bloodstream. \"The measles vaccine is live and \"sheds\" in their poo for up to 30 days. So take extra care with that.\" No it's not and no it doesn't. Please reconsider giving this person your money. Remember, this is a green parenting board - not an anti-vaccine board.

While innate immunity can provide some protection from infection it is not nearly as robust as adaptive immunity [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21070/.](//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21070/.) Vaccination initiates an adaptive immunological response whereby the child not only produces his/her own antibodies, but also activates cell mediated responses where immune system cells differentiate and actively seek out pathogens. Breastfeeding will not afford a child this level of protection, while vaccination will. Furthermore, the main antibodies present in breast milk are secretory IgA antibodies, which bind to mucosal secretions along epithelial cells. Now this can certainly help inhibit respiratory infections like measles, but the child still lacks any humoral or cell mediated response to infection. And, unfortunately, measles IgA antibody levels in breast milk drop below protective levels after the first two weeks of life. Research examining the concentration of measles antibodies in breast milk have shown that, while antibodies may be present, they are present in insufficient quantities to protect the child from infection [http://tropej.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/1/45.short.](//tropej.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/1/45.short.) While breast milk absolutely is beneficial in helping protect children from infection, it is dangerous to overestimate the degree of protection conferred by antibodies in breast milk Compiled by cinchi please just do it!! I am pregnant and found out at a check up that I'm not immune and can't get vaccinated while pregnant. If I catch something there is a chance of deformation or death for the fetus. Think of everyone you're effecting by NOT having her vaccinated and that should help! Isn't this a green space not an anti vacc space?? I'm confused. Who doesn't vaccinate?

The GI tract is an excellent barrier (when healthy) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) states that only 0.1-0.4% of aluminum ingested is actually absorbed. Therefore, up to 99.9% of aluminum is not absorbed when ingested (through breastmilk or food), and is eliminated/removed from the body before it ever reaches the bloodstream. In contrast of course, most vaccines are injected.The contents of an injected vaccine are not subject to the gastrointestinal tract. Aluminum, along with other ingredients, are injected intramuscularly in order to intentionally bypass the natural barriers of the body (skin, mucus membranes, etc. which exist to help to prevent absorption). Blood flows to and from our muscles, so the contents of a vaccine can enter the bloodstream rapidly. First, elimination from the blood does not equal elimination from the body. Depending on the individual, blood levels may drop as the aluminum becomes deposited in organs and tissues, or aluminum may get trapped at the injection site. Second, there is evidence from in vivo scientific research that once aluminum is injected via vaccine, it is not quickly eliminated from the blood. One study sought to measure the amount of aluminum eliminated from the body 28 days after injection. Urine and blood samples were taken daily. After 28 days, only 6% of the total aluminum injected had been eliminated. Blood levels demonstrated the persistence of aluminum as well. \"The blood concentration of aluminum was fairly steady from days 2 to 28 indicating a relatively constant absorption rate...\" According to what was found, up to 94% of the aluminum injected remains in the body (tissues, organs, and bloodstream), even 28 days post-vaccination. The study concluded at 28 days, so there's no way to know how much longer it might persist in the blood, however studies have found that in rare cases, aluminum injected via vaccine can remain at the injection site for ten years.
