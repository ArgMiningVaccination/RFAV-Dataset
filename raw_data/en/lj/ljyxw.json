Appendix A (01 -22) Surprise Billing \u2014 Know your rights Beginning January 1, 2020, Colorado state law protects you from \"surprise billing .\" This is sometimes called \"balance billing\" and it may happen when you receive covered services, other than ambulance services, from an out -of-network provider in Colorado. This law does not apply to all health plans and may not apply to out- of-network pr oviders located outside of Colorado. Check to see if you have a \"CO -DOI\" on your ID card; if not, this law may not apply to your health plan. What is surprise/balance billing and when does it happen? You are responsible for the cost -sharing amounts required by your health plan, including copayments, deductibles , and/or coinsurance. If you are seen by a provider or use services in a hospital or other type of facility that are not in your health plan's network, you may have to pay additional costs associated with that care. These providers or services at hospitals and other facilities are sometimes referred to as \"out -of-network .\" Out-of-network hospitals, facilities , or providers often bill you the difference between what Kaiser Permanente decides is the eligible charge and what the out -of-network provider bills as the total charge. This is called \" surprise\" or \"balance\" billing. When you CANNOT be balance -billed: Emergency Services When you receive services for emergency medical care, usual ly the most you can be billed for emergency services is your plan's in -network cost -sharing amounts, which are copayments, deductibles, and/or coinsurance. You cannot be balance- billed for any other amount. This includes both the emergency facility and any providers you may see for emergency care. Non- emergency Services at an In- Network or Out -of-Network Facility The hospital or facility must tell you if you are at an out -of-network location or at an in- network location that is using out - of-network providers. It must also tell you what types of services may be provided by any out -of-network provider. You have the right to request that in -network providers perform all covered medical services. However, you may have to receive medical se rvices from an out -of-network provider if an in -network provider is not available. When this happens, the most you can be billed for covered services is your in -network cost -sharing amount (copayments, deductibles, and/or coinsurance). These providers cannot balance bill you. Additional Protections Kaiser Permanente will pay out -of-network providers and facilities directly. Again, you are responsible only for paying your in- network cost -sharing for covered services. Kaiser Permanente will count any amount you pay for emergency services or certain out -of-network services (described above) toward your in -network deductible and out -of-pocket limit. Your provider, hospital, or facility must refund any amount you overpay within 60 days of y our reporting the overpayment to them. A provider, hospital, or other type of facility cannot ask you to limit or give up these rights. If you receive services from an out -of-network provider, hospital , or facility in any OTHER situation, you may still be balance- billed, or you may be responsible for the entire bill. If you intentionally receive non -emergency services from an out -of-network provider or facility, you may also be balance- billed. If you do receive a bill for amounts other than your co payments, deductibles , and/or coinsurance, please contact us at the number on your ID card, or the Division of Insurance at 303-894-7490 or 1-800-930-3745 (TTY 711) . Ambulance Information: You may be balance- billed for emergency ambulance services you receive if the ambulance service provider is a publicly funded fire agency, but state law against balance billing does apply to private companies that are not publicly funded fire agencies. Non -emergency ambulance services, such as ambulance transport betw een hospitals, are not subject to the state law against balance billing, so if you receive such services and they are not a service covered by Kaiser Permanente, you may receive a balance bill. 60577108_ACA_1557_MarCom_CO_2017_Taglines NONDISCRIMINATION NOTICE Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of Colorado (Kaiser Health Plan) complies with applicable Federal civil rights laws and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, or sex.

If your Plan Pro vider decides you need specialty care that is not eligible for a self- referral, they will request a referral for you to see a specialty -care Plan Provider. (See the \"Specialty Referrals\" section below.) These referral request s result in an Authorization or a denial. However, there may be circumstances where Health Plan will partially authorize your provider's referral request . An Authorization is a referral request that has received approval from Health Plan. An Authorization is limited to a specific Service, treatment or series of treatments, and period of time. The provider or facility to whom you are referred will receive a notice of the Authorization, and you will receive a written notice of the Authorization. This notice w ill tell you the provider's information. It will also tell you the Services authorized and the time period that the Authorization is valid. An Authorization is required for Services provided by Out -of-Plan Providers or Out -of-Plan Facilities. If your prov ider refers you to a n Out-of-Plan Provider or Out -of-Plan Facility, inside or outside our Service Area, you must have a written Authorization in order for us to cover the Services. All referral Services must be requested and authorized in advance. We will not pay for any care rendered by a provider unless the care is specifically authorized in advance by Health Plan.

This notice will tell you the provider's information. It will also tell you the Services authorized and the time period that the Authorization is valid. A Plan Provider can directly refer you for some laboratory or radiology Services and for specialty procedures such as a CT scan or MRI. However, certain laboratory or radiology Services and specialty procedures will still require an Authorization. 3.

The patient's medical condition may be so critical that you cannot call or come to one of our Plan Facilities or the emergency room of a Plan Hospital , or the patient may need Emergency Services while traveling outside our Service Area. When you receive Emergency Services from Out -of-Plan Providers, Post Stabilization Care may qualify as Emergency Services pursuant to federal law.

We shall have a first priority lien o n the proceeds of any judgment or settlement, whether by compromise or otherwise, you obtain against or from any other party, entity or insurer, regardless of whether the other party, entity or insurer admits fault.

You may request expedited external review simul taneously with your expedited internal appeal as permitted under this Membership Agreement. A request for an expedited external review must be accompanied by a written statement from your physician that your condition meets the expedited criteria.
