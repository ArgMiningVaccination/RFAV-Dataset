Read on to learn about toxic release after chiropractic adjustments.", "sitename": "losgatoschiro.com", "date": "2023-09-10", "cleaned_text": "Chiropractic adjustments can benefit you in many ways, including helping your body and mind find balance. But what about toxin release? If what appears to be detox symptoms took you by surprise after your chiropractic visit, we're here to tell you that these sensations are perfectly normal. To clear any questions you might have regarding detoxification, we'll explain why your body needs to cleanse itself to function well. We'll also look at how, and up to what point chiropractic treatments help promote that. The most common health problems people visit a chiropractor for include neck and lower back pain or headaches. But although these are called spinal adjustments, chiropractic manipulations aren't only beneficial for your spine or neck. In fact, chiropractic is a science that focuses on the body as a whole. It can help relieve pain, increase energy, correct alignment, and improve both your body's and your mind's overall function. Being a non-invasive and natural solution to many conditions, chiropractic care is a good alternative to painkillers or surgery. And when modern medicine is sometimes left powerless, a chiropractic adjustment can improve a patient's health and wellness in as little as one visit. For those new to chiropractic, the way you feel after adjustments might come as a bit of a surprise. Some of you might even get worried by the way your body reacts. But are the feelings people describe, such as discomfort, cold or flu-like symptoms, dizziness and lightheadedness, real detox symptoms? And does toxin release indeed happen following a chiropractic treatment? Keep reading to discover what you can truly expect from chiropractic adjustments. We'll also tell you the real benefits of chiropractic care and what is just a hoax. Some people state that the detox symptoms some patients experience after chiropractic adjustments are caused by their bodies' releasing toxins. To see if that is true or not, let's first look at what toxins are. Toxins are all the harmful substances around us that, when in high concentrations, can cause our bodies to get sick. Amongst the ones the majority of us deal with daily, pollutants occupy a leading position. We are talking about the pesticides, flame retardants, or polychlorinated biphenyls we are exposed to non-stop. These come from traffic, accessories like perfumes or candles, and even the foods we consume. Our bodies are built to deal with the chemical substances that might damage our health in many ways and most get secreted or recycled. What many of you don't know is that our organs have a complex and perfectly orchestrated chemistry to get rid of toxins in the body. Metabolic wastes are constantly being produced and recycled. No external help can ever replace the perfection to which our liver and kidneys keep the body functioning. The detox symptoms chiropractic patients might feel after adjustments are caused by releasing normal body chemicals and hormones. These substances generally accumulate in the capsules surrounding spinal misalignments or subluxations. During a chiropractic session, negative subluxations get realigned and in turn, those encapsulated chemicals are released. Ok, but what about the popping noise? Many patients ask us what the deal is with the popping sensations and noises they sometimes hear during chiropractic adjustments. These noises are not caused by toxic release either. What you're hearing are the tiny air pockets that naturally exist in your spinal joints releasing nitrogen oxide when manipulated. As shown above, the body doesn't need any help in detoxifying itself from harmful substances. And even if it did, no diet, pill, medical treatment, or chiropractic adjustment could ever come close to our bodies' natural processes. At least when it comes to toxin release. And since we've clarified that detox symptoms after a chiropractic adjustment aren't caused by the body detoxifying itself, let's look at what you can do to help yourself stay healthy. Our modern society doesn't entirely support people living healthy lives. Most of us have to deal with huge amounts of stress daily, supermarkets are full of processed foods, and the air we breathe is incredibly polluted. If you want to support optimal liver function, and as a result, a perfect natural detox, certain things might help though. Amongst them: Getting [the right amount of sleep](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/benefits-sleep-more) is essential for people of all ages. Even more so following chiropractic adjustments, when the body needs to restore. Most people need around 7- 8 hours of sleep each night. If you stick to this routine, you'll be less stressed, your overall performance will improve, and you'll find it much easier to fight diseases or recuperate from injuries. Our bodies are 60 % made of water. To keep all organs functioning properly we need to [stay well hydrated](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/290814) throughout the day. Make sure to drink the amount of water recommended for your age and body weight and supplement when it's very hot outside or when you exercise. Regular forms of [exercise are essential for our well-being](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/10-benefits-of-exercise) and help improve balance, flexibility, strength, mobility, and cardiovascular health. Don't think you need to run a marathon to get the positive benefits of sport though. Light exercise like walking, climbing stairs, or yoga is as good as intensive workouts, and can instantly improve how you feel. The right foods and nutrients can bring your body systems back in balance and help them stay that way. Try to eat as many vegetables and fruits as possible. Avoid refined carbohydrates, sugar, chemical additives, processed meats, fried foods, and soft drinks as much as you can. It's not uncommon to experience certain [sensations in your body after a chiropractic adjustment](https://www.spine-health.com/treatment/chiropractic/reactions-following-a-chiropractic-adjustment). When muscles and ligaments get readjusted, this can cause some temporary discomfort. Just rest assured that your body knows how to react to these new circumstances, and the symptoms will soon pass after an adjustment period. And although these strange sensations you might feel aren't caused by detox or toxic release, a chiropractic adjustment will clear the blockages preventing energy flow across your body. When your body functions well you won't have to worry about toxins and getting rid of them. Whatever symptoms you have, let your chiropractors know how you feel so that they can adjust your treatment accordingly. Also, don't forget to ask them to recommend a treatment plan tailored to your specific condition and body needs.
