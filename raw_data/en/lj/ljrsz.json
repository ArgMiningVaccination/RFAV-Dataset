A broad definition of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) is \"a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health-care system\" (The World Health Organisation, n.d.). Expanding on this definition it is important to address the variable similarities of CAM modalities. CAM therapies across the various modalities have in common a shared, in varying degrees, holistic approach and subscribe to some form of vitality - a contrast from the science-based view point of conventional medicine prevalent in western society. In spite of CAM therapies empirical nature and efficacies, it is suggested that dissatisfaction of conventional medicine underpins the popularity it has garnered, thus, it will be examined further as to how and why. A further discussion will be made to related dangers of both alternative and science-based medicine; providing an opportunity to constructively educate the public on the differences between the two systems. Throughout the years there have been two traditions within the practice of medicine. One is the 'art of healing ' which involves its own specialised brand of training. The art of healing is dependent on the prescriber 's foreknowledge and the clients' viewpoint of the prosperous results. The 'Science of healing ' is based on scientific and technological ideas. This tradition results in a lower liability for practitioners regarding the showing of an original approach to medicine, however the results of this method are more calculable (Kayne 2002). It is believed that the tradition of the 'art of healing' is increasing in popularity. The World Health Organisation states ' 'that the terms ' 'complementary medicine ' ' or ' 'alternative medicine' ' are used interchangeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country 's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system\" (World Health Organization 2000). This type of treatment, is commonly known as 'Complementary and alternative medicine' (CAM). The word complementary derives from the meaning 'together with' established practices and the word alternative refers to 'in place' of established practices. Some patients choose to participate in complementary therapies along with the medication prescribed by their general practitioner whilst others prefer complementary therapies as opposed to the medications Complementary and alternative medicine, or CAM, can be characterized as a gathering of restorative, human services, and healing systems other than those incorporated into health care in the United States. CAM incorporates the perspectives, speculations, modalities, items, and practices connected with these systems and their utilization to treat disease and advance health and prosperity (McKenzie, 2012). Even though heterogeneous, the significant CAM frameworks have numerous normal attributes, including an attention on individualizing medications, treating the entire individual, advancing self-consideration and self-recuperating, and perceiving the otherworldly way of every person. What's more, numerous CAM frameworks have attributes generally found in standard human services, for example, an emphasis on great sustenance and preventive practices. Dissimilar to standard medication, CAM frequently needs or has just restricted trial and clinical concentrate; then again, experimental examination of CAM is starting to address this learning crevice. In this manner, limits in the As complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) grows more popular with the American public, the question arises whether we should consolidate aspects of unorthodox medicine with standard care. Many, such as Dr. Andrew Weil, swear by CAM's effectiveness and urge for a more patient-centered approach to care (Relman). While CAM has no shortage of critics, a growing body of research is indicating the effectiveness of many CAM therapies in treating a variety of conditions. Patients, physicians, and researchers sometimes find that CAM therapies are more Physical changes of the body associated with pregnancy can increase the workload on various parts of the body. Many women experience symptoms of anxiety and depression during pregnancy. Unfortunately, it is not recommended that pregnant women consume medication during pregnancy. As an alternative ways to improve increased stress levels with anxiety and depression, massage therapy has been proven to be an effective treatment option for pregnant women. The following article in Infant Behavior and Development analyzed pregnant women diagnosed with major depression were given 12 weeks of twice per week massage therapy by their significant other or only standard treatment as a control group. The massage therapy group women versus the control group women not only had reduced depression by the end of the therapy period, but they also had reduced depression and cortisol levels during the postpartum period. Their newborns were also less likely to be born prematurely and low birthweight, and they had lower cortisol levels and performed better on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment habituation, orientation and motor scales (Field, Diego, Hernandez-Reif, &Figueiredo, 2009).Many women endure increased stress levels during pregnancy due to hormonal changes within the body. In this scenario, it is extremely important to manage stress effectively as the unborn child may also be effected Through the enthusiasm of alternative medicine by patients, the health and social care sector comes across to:\" ethical issues of efficacy, training, competence and patient safety, \"according to (Nursing times ,2005). Therefore, it is important to understand the principles behind complementary therapies and their usage. Aromatherapy can be used to treat many problems such as nausea, body aches, anxiety, depression, fatigue, headaches, labour pain and hormonal problems (Lane et al., 2011; Medicalnewstoday.com, 2018). Aromatherapy can be used in addition to other medicine practises including those performed by allied health professionals, or on its own (Medicalnewstoday.com, 2018). For example, a study conducted by (Olapour et al., 2013) has found that aromatherapy can provide pain relief to women who have recently had a Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a term that describes health and wellness therapies that have not been part of conventional medicine. Complementary treatments is with conventional medicine, and alternative treatments is used in place of conventional medicine. It can include treatments and therapies such as massage, natural products, meditation, yoga, vitamin supplements, herbs, chiropractic, acupuncture, and lots more. But problems arise when CAM is questioned if it scientifically helps patients overcome a disease. Is there really health benefits? Are some of the products natural? Do they come with risks? These are questions that can be asked when looking into CAM. -Peppermint -Spearmint -Wintergreen -Bergamot mint -Cloves -Rosemary -Cinnamon Second Trimester But it is still best to avoid the above mentioned essential oils during the second trimester because they could cause a baby to be born prematurely. However, a few essential oils that are very gentle can start to be introduced to help an expectant mother alleviate some of the symptoms of pregnancy. For example, chamomile essential oil can be diluted with coconut oil to use on the skin of the belly to prevent stretchmarks. It is also helpful for treating any acne that has developed on the face from fluctuations in hormone levels. Ylang ylang and lavender can also be used topically in homemade lotions, cool baths, and foot Like it or not, people are going to get sick. There will always be a need for medicine; however, recently people have been seeking complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) before going straight to conventional medical treatments. CAM is a nontraditional way to diagnose, prevent, or treat a specific problem and its symptoms. It differs from the more mainstream options in healthcare, and is not commonly used by medical practitioners. Complementary and alternative medicine is becoming more popular and accepted within the medical field by the various treatments and therapies used to promote and restore health. Complementary Alternative Therapy The National Health Institute defines complementary alternative therapy as a health care methodology used outside of or in addition to mainstream medicine (National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), 2013). CAM is divided into five groups: (1) oral based product, such as supplements, (2) body manipulation, such as massage, chiropractic, reflexing and osteopathy, (3) mind and body therapies, consisting of yoga, tai chi, meditation, biofeedback and hypnosis, (4) energy touches, which includes Reiki, Gigong, and prayer; and (5) holistic approaches, such as homeopathy, naturopathy, traditional Chinese and Indian medicine. According to Efthimiou, Kukar, and Mackenzie (2009) there has been exponential growth in those who seek CAM. In 2010, data demonstrates that 40-60% of Americans use CAM to cope with medical conditions. This growth trend is attributed to increased public awareness through social media and patient's desires to try something new and promising. Barnes and Bloom (2008) determined that individuals decided to use CAM therapies because they were frustrated by the lack of response This article is to describe writer's shadowing and clinical experience at the Robert Schad Naturopathic Clinic. On the first day, I got the opportunity to observe functioning of Robert Schad Naturopathic Clinic with Dr. Dylan. It was not a busy day, only two patients were seen. I arrived at the clinic at 2.00 pm and explained the purpose of my visit; Supervisor acknowledged my presence and requested me to give a brief introduction about myself. The surroundings were very pleasant; the interns were very friendly and the supervisor was very obliging and knowledgeable. He told me that he is available to assist me with any kind of concern I might have during my visit. So, I didn 't feel isolated during the observer ship. Introduction Today 's modern health care is ever evolving in its approach to health and care of a patient revolves around being culturally and ethnically competent in their treatment. In the United States (US), the growing aging population, brings an increasing public awareness of the major risk factors that are contributing to chronic illness. The availability of knowledgeable healthcare practitioners is also growing to meet the needs of this growing population. Complementary alternative medicine (CAM) is aimed to provide a multidisciplinary and educational health care experience. In this project, it will be explained about being culturally and ethnically competent and the use of alternative medicine as an adjunct therapy or a In this essay, I will determine how and to what extent aromatherapy should be tested to see its scientific validity. Science is ever changing, hypothesis built on top on ranging hypotheses, theory after theory continually being ratified and disproved, never-ending ideas of experiments, case studies, and surveys; these all furthering of human understanding of this world. Mainstream science can also often be classified as pseudoscience because it has hence been disproven, but not to the extent where the general public accepts or even realizes its apocryphalness. Aromatherapy is partially under this category because there is no definitive research proving either way because of the challenges in research, but in order to be determined scientifically Alternative Medicine Although \"Alternative\" or \"Complementary\" medicine has been kept on the fringes of the medical sciences in the past, it is becoming increasingly more popular, and more reputable. Alternative medicines are those medical systems which are not taught to or practiced by most conventional medical doctors. Alternative medicines seemingly have always existed, changing and conforming to the current climate of society. There seems to be an almost endless number of alternative medicines, each with their own method of gaining perfect health. Often people who are dissatisfied with conventional medicine turn to alternative medicine for their medical needs. Many similarities link the diverse extremities of alternative medicine. "}
