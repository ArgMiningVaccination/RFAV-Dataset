Jane Dunn and Linda Grant , June 2021 An interesting thing happened several times during the past few months of folks deciding and acting upon getting the Covid 19 vaccination. This was the thing...we both experienced the following reaction from several people...\"You got the vaccine! I thought you were holistic\". Yes folks, HOLISTIC is an adjective that describes things related to the idea that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. In other words, that the entirety of something must be considered instead of just considering its parts. So if one considers themselves HOLISTIC, then one would have to consider ALL options for keep, staying and being healthy. Now, having said that, we do not fault anyone who has considered their options for caring for their health, done their research, some critical thinking, and come to the conclusion that the vaccine is not for them. That too is HOLISTIC as one considers the entire picture and not just one part! There 5 aspects of HOLISTIC HEALTH: physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and mental. When it comes to holistic health we are looking beyond the physical body to include emotional, social, spiritual, and intellectual health. As we did our critical thinking and research about the vaccine, we took into account all 5 of these aspects. We will start with intellectual analysis. There is plenty of research on the vaccine put out by the manufacturers. After completely reading the information, we came to the conclusion that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine was the one that made the most sense for us. This moves us into the physical analysis which allowed for us to look at our general immune health and experience. We both have had the good fortune to rarely have experiences with any virus or infections in general. We seem to be doing enough things, and with some good genetics, we are pretty healthy most of the time! The social and emotional analysis were somewhat lumped together. The tension and fear in our society concerning Covid was palpable! We felt that the fear itself was in some ways more detrimental than the virus. Being part of community, whether our own town or this country, there are certain responsibilities that are expected of each member. As long as we knew that the vaccine was not going to hurt us, it was a loving thing for us to do to put the fears of family, clients and friends to rest. Finally, the spiritual analysis. This really takes into account all of the other 4 aspects of Holistic Health. It is no surprise that for both of us, a sense of interconnectedness with our divine source and others is at the forefront of most of our life decisions. When in doubt, do unto others, love others, love yourself and ultimately... ALL "}
