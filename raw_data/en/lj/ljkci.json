Welcome back to Renew Inspiration! Here's to another beautiful and blessed day! Michigan is still under the Stay-At-Home order due to the coronavirus (covid 19) outbreak. I don't know about you, but I am really scared. Our government leaders do not care about the needs and well-being of the people. The government is only focused on money and getting the economy back up and running. Rushing to open up businesses and become normal again. It doesn't matter about how many of us are still dying alone from this awful virus. I've taken this time to overcome my personal spiritual imbalance. Instead of focusing on the fear of the unknown, I am choosing to pray, read God's Word, and write in my journal. This process has helped me shift my mindset so I can improve my spiritual well-being. SPIRITUAL JOURNEY Thy word is thy lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. (Psalm 119:105) How often do you read and study God's Word? Do you just read your favorite Bible verse, pray, then move on with your day? In order to overcome spiritual imbalance in our lives, it is important to schedule quality time to not only read God's Word, but also to write down our personal thoughts about the scriptures read and to determine how we can apply the scriptures to our own lives. Here's some ways to begin your spiritual journey: Set a time to better engage in God's Word and stick to your plan. Gather your materials, such as Bible, Notebook/Journal, Pens, Highlighters, Sticky Notes, Bible Concordance, Dictionary, etc. Designate a quiet space with no distractions. Play soft music in the background to set a relaxing mood. Make sure your study area is free of clutter and well lit. Pray and meditate while studying God's Word to open your mind and heart. Speak to God often to strengthen your relationship. Ask God to direct your Bible study time. AMAZON RESOURCES #1 SPIRITUAL BALANCE Life is all about balance. You don't always need to be getting stuff done. Sometimes it's perfectly okay, and absolutely necessary, to shut down, kick back, and do nothing. - Lori Deschene To strive for spiritual balance within your life, it is important to face each day with a positive attitude. Dig deep inside to strive for new opportunities that surround us every day. Focus on right now and not what ifs. Believe it or not, even as I type these words, it seems easier said than done. I realize it will not be easy for some, but to move to a better place in life, we sometimes need to place ourselves in uncomfortable situations and/or conversations. Involve yourself with like-minded individuals who build you up and not tear you down. Here's some ways to help you find spiritual balance within your life: Write your thoughts and feelings in a journal. Read and be grounded in God's Word. Meditate and be prayerful often. Practice yoga and stretch routines. Read inspirational and spiritual books. Set some attainable goals for yourself. Post positive quotes where you can read them daily. Recite positive affirmations throughout your day. AMAZON RESOURCES #2 MIND, BODY & SPIRIT - MEDITATION My mind and body are in perfect balance. I am a harmonious being. - Louise Hay When thinking about spiritual balance, it is important to prepare your mind, body and spirit for your spiritual journey. From experience, it is difficult to have spiritual balance without first getting the mind ready to receive our spiritual gifts from God. So, in addition to reading and studying God's Word, it is also important to practice meditation regularly. Meditation can be defined as a practice where an individual focuses his or her mind on a particular object, thought, or activity to achieve a mentally clear and emotionally calm state. Remember, practice makes perfect so make sure to plan for meditation every day. It's important to start with good breathing techniques when doing your meditation. In addition, create a peaceful and safe space where you will not be distracted during your meditation. It is important to let go of any and all frustrations throughout the meditation process. Meditation, when done correctly, offers many benefits throughout your life. Here's some helpful benefits of meditation: Reduces stress and anxiety. Reduces impulsivity, cravings, and addictions. Increases resilience in hard times. Increases happiness and optimism. Helps create loving, harmonious relationships. Increases focus, creativity, and life satisfaction. Increases memory, compassion, and productivity. Produces a deep state of peace and well-being. AMAZON RESOURCES #3 LET'S PRAY Pray. Wait. Trust. - Unknown Author When life gives you more than you can stand, take a moment to close your eyes, bow your head, and kneel. Open your heart, then open your mouth. Allow true words to flow from your lips. Prayer is the world's greatest wireless connection. Prayer is more powerful than any level of education, wealth or status. Simply put, prayer changes everything! Dear God, Enlighten what's dark in me. Mend what's broken in me. Bind what's bruised in me. Heal what's sick in me. And lastly, Revive whatever peace and love has died in me. Amen. Written by Winston Porter Each day I need to let God's Word interrupt me, rearrange me and redirect me. My prayer today is that you start taking this time to focus on overcoming spiritual imbalance within your own life. Remember, if it doesn't challenge you, it won't change you. Water your roots, so your soul can blossom. Peace and blessings! AMAZON RESOURCES #4 JOURNAL PROMPTS Balance your life with spiritual experiences that remind and prepare you for continued, daily ministering to others. - M. Russell Ballard I love journaling because it is a safe place for me to put my feelings and emotions into words, then put my words into action. Remember, journaling is your very own personal journey throughout life, your ups and downs, your successes and failures. In addition, journaling is a powerful way to process events in your life, build self-awareness, get more clarity, and keep yourself on track. Journaling also allows for past reflection, future insight, and present surrender. Keep in mind that this is a journey. Everyone takes their own path. Ready, set, write!
