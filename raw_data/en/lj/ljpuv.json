The Rolfing process enables the body to regain natural integrity of its form, thus enhancing postural efficiency and freedom of movement and expression. Clients who have difficulty with posture, chronic pain, restriction, or a sense of unease often feel Rolfing helps them find integration. The Rolf practitioner maintains a holistic view of the client's entire system during each session, thus ensuring the transformation process is harmonious.

For example, a runner who is in training would have little use for getting deep work in their arms. On the other hand, if they were a climber, that would be where they would want the most attention. I am happy to put together a session specific to your needs. It is important to note that no two therapy sessions are the same.
