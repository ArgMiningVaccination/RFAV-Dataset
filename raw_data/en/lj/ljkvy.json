Illness Experience of Chinese Immigrants with Chronic Fatigue and Weakness. The Institute of Medical Science, University of Toronto. Chmnic fatigue and weakness are common complaints afflicting patients seeking relief fiom physicians wodd-wide. People of Chinese decent comprise the largest visible minority and fastest growing language group in Canada (Stathics Canada, 1996). Traditional Chinese health beliefs and practices are vady different Eom the biomedical mode1 on which the Canadian health care system is based. Purpose: To clariQ the illness experience of Chinese immigrants suffering from chronic fatigue and weakness and to determine its practical clinical significance. Theontical Framework: Kleinman's (1980) Explanatory Model of Illness, Gohan (1 963) and Kleinrnan and colleagues' (1995) theories on stigma Method: Ethnographic study with a quantitative component. 50 Chinese patients referred by theu fdly physicians were interviewed using the EMIC (Explanatory Model interview Catalogue) a semistnictured instrument, for studying illness experience (Weiss, 1997). Results: The impact of migration is a dominant theme in most patients' narratives of their health problems. Patients reported multiple symptoms, predominantly somatic. Due to the \"mknown nature\" of their illness and the inability to'live up to the Chinese ethos of hard work and family glory, participants felt stigrnatized not just for themselves but for their families. Avoid disclosure was their prefemd strategy for minimizing the pain of perceived stigma. Social and contextual issues, such as interpersonal confiict and underemployment were the most prominant perceived causes of the\u00f9 fatigue. Mormants sought help \u20acrom multiple sources for their iliness, with the majority relying on self-help, family, and fiiends. Despite limited efficacy of treatrnent ftom Western physicians, participants were satisfied with doctoa who were supportive and showed interest in theu concerns. Practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine were regarded as healen who could \"get to the root\" of their illness, but financial constraints deterred help-seeking fiom this group of caregivers. Conclusion: Findings of this study indicate the complexity of patients' explanatory models of illness. The practical significance of illness experience and its impact on stigrna, heip-seeking, course and outcome should be studied fiuther in the context of the Canadian mdticultural mosaic. Clinicians need to pay attention to adjustment issues confionting immigrant patients who suffer from an il1-defined chronic illness, as well as other disorders. I wish to express my most sincere gratitude to my thesis supervisor, Dr. Gary Rodin, for his wisdom, guidance and his gift of king a great teacher and researcher. His genuine interest in this study is much appreciated. To rny committee members, Dr. Jerry Devins, Dr. Wsevolod Isajiw and my mentor in Transcuiturai Nursing, Professor May Yoshida, 1 extend great thanks for their howledge, scholarly advice and stimulating perspectives. A special thank you is extended to Dr. Mitchell Weiss for his expertise and unf\u00e0iling support thtoughout this study. He has taught me how to leam through cyberspace where he coached me every step of the way of the entire research process of this study. Further thanks go to Dr. Catherine Whiteside, Ms. bsie Chapman-Smith and Ms. Sharon Wright for their kindness and understanding at moments when 1 needed them the most. To the participants of this study, 1 am indebted and gratefiil to theu trust and sharuig of their lived experience with me. My appreciation also goes to the fady physicians who had screened and refemd patients to this cescarch. Their kind assistance was essentiai to the completion of this study . Finaily, 1 would like to th& my parents, femily, many dear fiends and coileagues for their encouragement and faith in me. My utmost admiration and gratefulness go to my husband, Richard Chan, without his love, patience and support, the study would not have been possibIe. TABLE OF CONTENTS ..

CFS is a persistent, often debilitathg disorder of unknown cause characterized by fatigue, pain and cognitive disorden. NeUrasthenia, similarly, denotes a constellation of symptoms including lassitude, poor concentration, headache and sleep disturbance (Lee, S., 1998). While extensive information dealing with the illness experience of patients suiTering fiom CF has been gathered, relatively linle is known about patients fiom specific ethnocultural groups. Studies conducted rarely examine the cultural origins of their subjects and non-English speaking patients are usually excluded from research protocols. Culture, however, has a profound influence on people's health belief system, illness management and helpseeking bebviour (Kleinrnan, 1980). Fnquently, the attitudes of ethaic minorities towards illness are different fiom the values embodied in the heaith care system of the host society; this situation can lead to ineffective \u00fbeatment and dissatisfaction both on the part of the clients and health care providers (Anderson, 1986; Chan, F., Lam, Wang* Leung, & Fang, 1988; Eisenbmch & Handelman, 1990). According to Statistics Canada, the 1996 census reported that mughly 11 -2% of aU Canadians and 15.8% of Ontsrians consider thernselves to be members of a visible miwrity group. In the Grriita Toronto Am, where this study was conducted, visible minorities account for about 31.6% of the population of 4.2 milrion. The Chcse population has a 150 y- 2 pnsence and history in Canada, including the most ment infiux of immigrants which contribute to make the Chinese the largest visible minority group in Canada and Toronto (Statistics Canada, 1996). Furthemore, the Chinese are known to have a health belief system and a value system that are distinct from that of the larger Canadian society. \"If you wish to help a commuuity improve its bealth, you mut leam to think like the people of that community\" (Paul, 1955, p. 1). The goal of this shidy is to present to health care workers a clinical ethnography of Chinese immigrants who suffer fiom CF and weakness. This study will provide a better understanding of the illness experience of this group of patients, and more specifically will aid health care workers in (1) gaining a better appreciation of how Chinese patients cope with an illness that is not well defined and (2) improving their ability in the promotion of culhirally sensitive and appropriate care for patients from the cdW1y diverse Canadian mosaic. This is an ethnographie snidy with a quantitative component. Its prirnaq focus is on how culture shapes the illness expenences of the Chinese immigrants. However, it is imperative to understand how their experiences intersect with the\u00f9 status as an ethnic minority and the Cdan (Western) health care system which may be vastly different fiom the one they are familiar with. To that end, background information and a literatwe review on medically unexplaineci CF and CFS, had\u00eetional Chinese philosophy, and, health beliefs in relation to CF are presented. Kleinman's (1980) Explanatory Mode1 of Illness, which was developed through extensive research with the Chinese population in China and Taiwan, is the theoreticai hmework use\u00e2 to guide this snidy. Pmfound stigma has been imposed by the Chinese population on ilinesses with poorly understood etiology and is the curnt issue with CF and weaioress. Therefore, t&e collceptua\u00fczations of stigma by \u00fboffmsn (1963), and by Kieinman and CO-workers (1995) were employed to cornplanent Kieaman's (1980) Expbatoty Modei of 3 Illness. Data were collected by meam of a cultural epidemiological instnunent for use in clinid or field setting - the Explanatory Mode1 Interview Catalogue (EMIC) - a semi-stnictured interview schedule developed with reference to Kleinman's (1980) Explmatory Mode1 of Illness (Weiss, 1997). A Chinese immigrant sample was selected, so that an ethnic minority perspective could be elicited. Both qualitative and quantitative data analysis methods were used to help interpret the rich data set genenited through the EMIC. This thesis consists of seven chaptem. This first chapter presents the problem and objectives of this study. The second chapter describes the background of the topics pertinent to the study, namely, CF and CFS and cultural factors pertahhg to the Chinese population and stigma. The third chapter presents the theoretical frsmework and a review of the literature of the study. The fourth chapter outlines the methodology of this study. The fifth chapter presents the results of the study with reference to the research questions and objectives of the study. The sixth chapter discusses research fmdings in relation to other research as well as Chinese culture and philosophy. A discussion of methodological issues is also included. The concluding chapter discusses the implications of the nsuh and provides recommendations. Cbapter II BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFJICANCE This chapter presents the background and significance of the study and is divided into six major sections. The first two sections provide the historic and current overviews of CF and CFS. In the third section, the reiationship between CF and neurasthenia is described. The fourth and the fifth sections address cultural factors and the impact of migration on patients. In the last section, the traditional Chinese concepts of health and illness are explored. Finally, the objectives of this study are outlined. Historie Ovewiew of Cbronic Fatigue and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Historically, me\u00e0ically unexplained CF and its nlated Epstein-Bair virus syndrome, Icelandic disease, Royal Free Epidemic and the 'yuppie Bu' (Abbey & Garfinkel, 1991; The Magazine, 1987; Wessely, 1990). Reports of CF date back to 1869 when an American neurologist, George Beard, reported the first cases which he labelled nedenia in the Boston Medical and Surgical Jod (Yan, H., 1989). Conceptual and Methodologid Issucs CFS has ken amibuted to a variety of causes including chronic bruceliosis, chronic candidiasis, and allergies. Although some immunological abnonnalities are detectable in a mlliority of patients dering hm fatigue, the sippincance of this is uncertain, as the immune abnonnalities do not exist in all patients or correlate with the patients' mire patients suggested tha\u00ee the Epstein- 5 Barr virus is only rarely responsible for CFS; other studies reported that almost 90% of the healthy adult population have ckculating Epstein-Barr virus, and that not al1 patients meeting the criteria of CFS have a history of elevated Epstein-Barr virus level (Buchwald, Sullivan, & Komaroff, 1987; Kroenke, Wood, Mangelsdorff, Meier, & Powell, 1988; Straus, 1991). Laboratory tests are of limited usefiilness in the diagnosis of the syndrome (Buchwald, Wener, Pearhan, & Kith, 1997b; KomarofX, 1993; Kroenke et al., 1988). A prospective cohort study in primary care of 1,199 patients with symptomatic infections showed no evidence that common idective episodes an related to the onset of CF or CFS (Wessely, Chalder, Hirsch, Pawilkowska, Wallace, & Wright, 1995). in order to improve the compbility and reproducibility of research and to provide a rational basis for evaiuating patients with medically undetermineci CF, the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) developed a working case definition for this complex of symptoms which they temed Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS). Under this definition, patients suffering fiom CFS experience severe, persistent, and unexplained fatigue in combination with other cornplaints, such as muscle and joint pain, headache, sore throat, fever, weakness, dizziness, concentration difficulties and memory loss. This definition describes the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, and excludes any chmnic or active physical or psychiatrie ilInesses that can produce chronic fatigue (Holmes, Kaplan, Gantz, Komaroff, Schonberger, Straus, Jones, Dubois, & Brus, 1988). Psychiatrie conditions, such as major depression, @c disorder and somatintion have been found to be common in patients suffeRng hm CFS, at a fkquency five times greater than in the general population (Manu, Lane, & Matthews, 1993; Schulberg, Sad, & McCleliand, ta& of identifYine the issues. Some 6 researchers have argued that different conditions, rather than a defined disease entity, are being grouped together under the label of CFS (Holmes, 1991; Sharpe, Aichard, Banatvala, Borysiewicz, Clare, et al., 1991). Despite extensive research there is no defulltive diagnostic test or effective treatrnent for this syndrome (Wessely et al., 1995); interventions are only directed at the relief of specific symptoms and maintenance of the patient's level of fiulctioning (Buchwald, Defmition of Chronic Fatigue and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome The complexities associated with the \u00e2iagnosis and study of CFS prove the need for a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the problem. The International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group proposed guidelines for the clinical evaluation and study of CFS and other illnesses associated with unexplaineci CF (Fukuda, Straus, Hickie, Sharpe, Dobbins, Komaroff, & the International Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group, 1994). These guidelines provide specific parameters to allow differentiation of CFS fkom other fatigue-related illnesses, as well as an integrated approach to the sndy of \"persans with this condition and other fatiguing ilinesses\" (p.953). Psychiatrie disorders, such as anxiety disorders and less severe forms of depression, werc recognized as being highly pmalent in patients with CFS and, therefore, were not used as a basis for exclusion (Appendix A, p.237). Medicaily unexplained CF is defined as \"self-reported, persistent or relapsing fatigue lasting six or more consecutive months\" (Fukda et ai., 1994, p.954) and its sufferet is not a patient of any active or chronic medicai or psychological ihess hcludhg substance abuse. CFS, as a subset of unexplained CF, is defined as \"ciinicai1y evaluated, unexplained, persistent or nlapsing chronic fatigue that is of new or definite onset\" (p.956). It is not the redt of ongohg exertion nor can it be niieved by mst, and it naden the derer with a substantial decnase in the level of f\u00f9nctioning. Four or more of tht foiiowing symptoms pcrsist over a Grnonth paiod as 7 coIiSfiniting the cliaical profile of CFS: muscle and joint pain, headache, sore throat, fever, weakness, dizhess, concentration difficulties, and memory loss, (Fukuda et al., 1994). The present study incorporated these guidelines in focmulating the criteria for the selection of its subjects, including both CF and CFS patients. Pmalence of Chrooic Fati ye and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Fatigue is the chef cornplaint of at least 5% of patients in primary care and is responsible for over 10 million visits to physicians every year in the United States (The National Ambulatory Medicai Care Survey, 1978). Studies have estimateci the prevalence of fatigue in general medical practice to be 2 1 % to 47% (Buchwald et al., 1987; Jemt, 198 1 ; Kroenke et ai., 1988; Sugarman & Berg, 1984). In a swey of a community sample of 13,538 people, 23% reported having experienced the symptom of persistent fatigue sometime during their lives; for 59% of this group, fatigue was unexplained by medicd causes (Rice, North, Wessely, & Fraser, 1992). Another survey, sampling 18,571, found a lifetime prevalence of fatipe of 24.4% in the general population with medicaily unexplained CF (Waker, Katon, & Jemeka, 1993). A swey of a randorn sarnple of 4,000 members of a US health maintenance organhtion reported the prevalence of CF as ranging hm L .775 to 6,321 cases per 100,000 (Buchwaid, Umali, P.. Umali, J., Kith, Pearh, & Komaroff, 1995). Researchers have also found that women have a risk ratio that is 1.5 times greater than men, and that only one out of every 400 episodes of fatigue or mess experienced by young women is brought to the attention of a physician (Banks, Beresforci, Mod, Walker, & Watk\u00efns, 1975; 8 Chen, M., 1986). This suggests that the symptom of fatigue may be much more prevalent than is reflected in studies of general practice. While medically unexplained CF is relatively common in primary care, debilitating cases of CFS, as defined by the CDC critena, have been found to be quite rare both in the general public and in medical outpatients. However, cnteria fiom Amencan, British and Australian case def~tions al1 generate diffierent prevalence rates (3 to 10 per 1,000) of the syndrome (Bates, Schmitt, Buchwald, Ware, Lee, Thoyer, Komish, & Komaroff, 1993; Gunn, Connell, & Randall, 1993; Pnce et al., 1992). An estimated crude point prevalence of CFS ranghg fiom 75 to 267 cases per 100,000 has also been reported (Buchwald et al., 1995). About 30,000 Canadians are said to saer from the illness (Bouw, 1998). Social and Financial Impact Although there is Me agreement on the prevalence of CF and CFS, the social and financial impact fkom both are sigaificant. Patients with fatigue have a significantly higher utilization of hedth care services than patients without current episodes of fatigue (Walket et al., 1993). This contributes to a serious strain on sauce health care resources. AMU~ charges for ambulatory medical care averaged US\u00e2356 for patients who are suffering fkom fatigue compared to USS126 for patients who are not suffe~g fiom fatigue, with hospital admissions twice as common for fatigue patients. More than USS300 million in annual medical care costs were incurred by patients dering fiom fatigue in the United States (Momson, JafYe, f 988). A British study also reported an overall prevalence of fatigue of 1.3 per 1,000 patients, with aimost half rqwring signifiant or excessive amounts of the hm thek general practitioneis (Ho-Yen & McNamata, 199 1). in the US, the mean number of health cm visits per year has ken reported to be 21 for CFS patients, 38% of whom are disabled by their illness (Buchwald & Garrity, 1994). An Australian study was conducted to estimate the economic impact of CFS on the individual, the goverment, and the community. It was found that, with a prevalence of 37.1 cases per 100,000 people of a total general population of 16,956,800, that CFS generated an annual cost of at least $59 million Australian (Lloyd & Pender, 1992). The prognosis for CF and CFS patients has not ken encouraging, with only 3% of the patients reporting complete recovery, and 17% to 35% reporting improvement (Clark, Meer, & Bleijenbery, 1996). Buchwald and CO-workers (1996) reported that patients with CF and CFS have marked impairment in hctional status. They tended to be severely disabled, particularly in role functioning, social functioning and vitality. In a case controlled study comparing two groups of 64 primary care patients with and without CF, Cope and CO-workers (1996) reported diat CF patients experienced significantly more physical and psychological distress than their 'kithout CF\" counterparts. Almost 86% claimed that fatigue interfered with their social activities, 75% with their work performance, and 67.2% said that they had stopped one or more activities because of fatigue. Disruptions in employment were reported by Yeomans aMi Conway (1991). Only 13% of their sample were able to maintain full-time employment, and 47% had become unemployed because of CFS. A IO-year follow-up of 23 patients in Australia found that 7 patients still deced hm the illness. Aithough 16 of them were able to retum to a premorbid level of activity, d of them dered a length of disability, hm one to eight years (Levine, Snow, Ranum, Paul, & Holmes, 1997). The socid and financial impact due to human mffeting and loss in pmductivity are yet to be calculated. Neurasthenia CFS has ken suggested by some to be \"an old wine in a new bottle,\" that it is actually neurasthenia renamed for the 1980's (Abbey & Garnnkel, 1991; Greenberg, 1990; McSheny, 1993; Wessley, 1990). A British study reported that the World Heaith Organization's International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition's (ICD- 1 O) dennition of neurasthenia identifies almost al1 (97%) of th eir subjects with the CDC's definition of CFS (Farmer, Jones, Hillier, Llewelyn, Borysiewicz, & Smith, 1995). However, neurasthenia is not recognized by the American Psychiatric Association as a diagnosis. In 1979 it was excluded fiom the publication of the Amcrican Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition @SM-III). Neurasthenia remains listed in the ICD-10 (World Health Organization, 1992), and is widely used in many Asian codes (Altshuler, Xida, Haiging, et al., 1988; Chang, 1987; Cheung, F., 1989; Lin, T., 1989; Yao, H., 1989). Despite its Western roots, neUrasthenia is a diagnosis well accepted by physicians, patients and the generai public in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan (Cheung, F., 1989; Lin, T., 1989; Rin Br Huang, 1989; hang, M., 1989, Zhong, 1992). Rin and Huang (1989) reported that even pmtitioners of traditional Chinese medicine have adopted this terni and use it frequently. Neurasthenia is conceived in traditional Chinese medicine as a decrease in vital energy (qi) caused by harmf\u00f9i faors in the physical and social environment, as well as by the patient's bodily constitution. These factors affect the f'unctioning of the five interna1 organ systems which, in hua, cause a deficiency of qi, and lower bodily resistance (Cbinese-English Terrninology of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 1983 cited in Kleinman, 1986). Furthemore, nemuthenia is ofkn describeci in conjunction with the concept of shen kuei (kidney weakness), which is characteriad by weabiess, fatigue, insoda, anxiety and hypochondria (Lin, T., 1985). II Chewg (1989) noted that in the popular books on nedenia in Hong Kong, weakness, fatigue, insuficiency of qi or blood, poor appetite, backache and weak limbs, difficdties in thinking and memory, were ail cited as major symptoms of neurasthenia. The recommended treatment was tonics indicated for symptoms of \"weakness.\" Treatment modalities with resemblance to treatrnents for neurasthenia in the George Beard era (1869) aimed ai restoring depleted nerve force and bolstering the body's natural healing processes, including Est, special diets, and medicine that would stimulate the body and rid it of toxic substances (Stea & Fried, 1993). Chinese newspapers in Canada abound with health columns that discuss etiologies and treatments for neurasthenia &au, 1996). \"Stasis of liver qf' and the stress associated with being a new immigrant are often cited as causes of neurasthenia (Tm, 1995). The concept of neurasthenia shares similar fahires with the concepts of vitalism (qi) and weakness (xu) in traditional Chinese medicine. The Chinese term, shen-jing shuai-ruo (shenjing means neurological and shuai-ruo means weakness), conveys the same vague idea of organic pathology that the term murasthenia connotes in English. The patient would sser fiom non- specific sigm and symptoms associated with the weakness of the neurological system, resulting in a gened weakness in the body (Kieinrnan & Mendelsohn, 1978; Lee, S., 1998). A longitudinal community study, conducted in Switzerland of fifty-one 20-year-old neurasfhenic patients, reported that over a 10-year-period half of them continued to exhibit the disorder at an averaged dwation of 4 years (Merikangan & Angst, 1994). As expressed in the Chinese language, symptoms associated with neurasfhenia resemble mmy ailments in traditional Chinese medicine. For example, the main symptoms of neurasthenia - fatigue and weakness - share the same ciinicai features of xu (deficiency or weakness) in Wtional Chinese medicine; other symptoms, such as Uisomnia, poor concentration and poor memory correspond to the main symptoms ofshon hei (kidney weahess) in traditionai Chinese 12 medicine (Zhang, M., 1989). In fact, it has also been argued that nedenia has remained a popular diagnosis in the Chinese community because of the non-stigmatizing nature of the term. It carries the connotation of weakness due to overwork, thus allowing the patient and his or her family to be fiee of psychiatrie labels that suggest insanity. Chinese practitioners may tend to imply that neusthenia and CF have a benign prognosis, and in a clinical setting this fnunework may impmve the rapport between practitioners and patients and enhance the effectiveness of therapeutic relationships (Cheung, F. & Lau 1982; Rin & Huang 1989; Zhang, M., 1989). Therefore, in Chinese culture, patients with CF and weakness may experience less stigma than the\u00f9 Western counterparts (Yeh, 1992). A study of neurasthenic patients in China reports that, like most patients in non-Western cultures, Chinese patients tend to have a somatic orientation for their illness when psychological cornplaints are stigmatized (Kleinrnan, 1982)+ As a result, treatrnents targeting somatic syrnptoms usdly sought by Chinese patients who suffer fiom neUrasthenia (Lin, T., 1989). Thus, it is important to explore perceived stigma and how it exerts its effects on patients' hel p-seeking behaviours. Cultural Factors Culture influences the way patients view h&h, health tare and how they present, explain and deal with their illnesses (Hm&, 198 1; Kleinman, Eisenberg, & Good, 1978; Pachter, 1987). Cultural health beliefs may be so powemil as to influence mortality rates. Phillips and CO-workers (1993) reviewed death certificates of 28,169 Chinese and 412,632 White Americans and found that the Chinese gmup died 1.3 to 4.9 years eariier than their Amencan comterparts if they had a combination of disease and biah year which Chiaese as\u00eerology and medicine consider iU-faied. The of iives lost is didy popmional to how sirongly the group is attacheci to Chinese traditions. Chinese astrology and medicine consider a person's f\u00e0te is influenced by year of bkth 13 which is associated with one of the following five phases: metal (years ending in O or l), water ending in 8 or 9). It is believed that a person bom in a particular year is more affected than othea by the element associated with that year. Since the astrology pdctions hold most strongly for the most traditional Chinese, these researchers concluded that their findings result at least partly from psychosomatic processes. Health care outcornes, such as cornpliance and satisfaction with care, are directly related to how closely patients' perceptions of their health problem nsemble those of their caregivers' (Kleinman, 1980). Caregivers' lack of cultural sensitivity or racial bias in treatment recommendations may compromise the quaiity of cm and possibly lead to misdiagnosis in ethaic minority patients (Lewis-Fernandez & Kleinman, 1995). A difference in the prevalence of fatigue among cultural groups was found by Cathebras and CO-workers (1 992); these researchers reported a higher rate of fatigue among French-Canadians compared to their English speaking counterparts. A community epidemiologic survey of 1,747 Chinese Arneficans in California showed a 12-month prevalence rate of nemuthenia at 3.66% (Zheng, Lin, Takeuchi, Kurasaki, Wang, & Cheung, 1997). Lee, S. and CO-workers (2000) in their study of 100 primary care patients with chronic fatigue in Hong Kong reported a CFS prevalence rate of 3%. However, most of the research subjects in CF and CFS studies are White, and prevalence rates are found to be higher for the White population than for the non-Whites (Buchwald, Pearlman, Kith, Katon, 1997; Ware, 1993). It is wt certain whether this difference is a ceflection of an achial miai diBennce in prevalence, an under-representation of non-Whites in the selected sample, or diffig heaith are utiliziition 14 patterns of non-Whites compared to Whites. Buchwald and CO-worken (1995) conducted a swey on the prevalence of CF and found that over 10% of the patients were unable to participate because they did not speak English. Impact of Migration \"Immigration represents an interruption and hstration of natural life expectancies, with al1 the related anxieties and potential damage to self-concepty7 (Suh, 1980, p. 207). Research conducted over the past six decades indicates that migration and the resulting confrontation with an unfamiliar culture are stressful life events that cm affect a migrant's psychological well-being (Mirdal, 1984). The ethnic configuration of Canada has diversified over ment years as a result of Unmigration. Statistics Canada (1996) indicated that this country is ww home to over 100 different cultural groups. Although Eastern and Northem Europe was the main source of immigration during the poa World War II era, forty-eight percent of Canada's immigrants today are of Asian ongin. Adjustulg to a society with a vastly different value system than one's own and the difficulty of leaming English for a tonal laquage speaker, may pose tremendous stress on immigrants from Asian codes (Nicassio, Solomon, Ouest, & McCullough, 1986). The pater dissimilarity between culture of origin and culture of destination, the greater the dificuity for the newcomer in adjusting to hidher new environment. Values embedded in the host country's social and governmental agencies, such as the health care system, may lead to confision and ambiguity for some immigrants hm cultures that are very different fiom their host country (Westemeyer, 1989). The wony of an uncertain future due to the transf\u00e9r of Hong Kong to Comtnunist China has bileci waves of migration hm Hong Kong in the past decade (Holroyd & Mackenzie, 1995). Avoiding political uncertainty in theu place of origh, obtauiing a beaa qdty of Ke, and 15 attaining better educational opportunities and upward social mobility for theu children, have been cited as main reasons for migration by Chinese immigrants (Wong, L. & Ng, 1998). Canada is, by far, the most desirable destination for these immigrants. According to the 1996 census (Statistics Canada, 1996), Chinese is the third most-common language spoken in Canada after English and French. Over 40% of the Chinese in Canada reside in Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area. The Chinese have been immigrating to Canada since 1858 and the pattern of migration has largely been shaped by the political, social and economic conditions of both countries (Li, P., 1992). Unlike the immigrants of the 19th century, who were rnainly railway workers hm rural China, Chinese immigrants today are mainly fiom Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Vietnam and include people fiom al1 walks of Me - fiom the highly professional to manual labourers (Statistics Canada, 1996). Because of the current economic hardships and the fact that their overseas credentials are ofien not recognized in Canada, many bread-winners feel obligated to retain their employrnent in their countries of origin, while theu families stay in Canada in order to fullil1 the requkments for Canadian citizenship (Kendall, 1989). Resdts hm the pilot study of this research indicated that subjects' immigration experience affectecl the way they perceived and coped with theu illness. The impact of migration on these \"single\" or \"astronaut\" families in a foreign land is yet to be assessed. This study was cognizant of the issues related to the immigration experience of the subjects, as they were al1 f\u00efrst generation immigrants. Traditional Chinese Concepts of Health and Ikem in Western medicine, the primary explanatory mode1 of ihess focuses on abnonnalities in the structure and hction of body orgaiis and systems. As one of the oldest civihtions in the world, the Chinese cidhat\u00efon has a decply rooted phiiosophical, value and heaith belief system 16 that is vastly different fkom the West (Kleinman, 1980). Thus, Chinese patients who der from CF and weakness may have very different perceptions and illness experiences compared to their Western counterparts who are familiar with the Western biomedical illness model. A brief overview of Chinese philosophical and religious teachings, history and the development of traditional Chinese medicine, its theoretical concepts, especially those focusing on fatigue and weakness, is presented below. This background information can provide an explanation for the respoases and help-seeking behaviours of Chinese patients with CF and their families. Chinae Pbiiosophical and ReliBous Teachings Conf\u00f9cianism, Taoism and Buddhism are the three major philosophical and religious teachings that have guided Chinese moral and ethical considerations for centuries. The impact of these beliefs on the Chinese people can still be felt in various Chinese communities around the world. To a great extent, these three major philosophies overlap and most Chimse have intemalized these teachings during the course of their upbringing. Traditional Chinese medicine is based on the principles of Taoism, and therefore sets the framework for Chinese patients' perceptions of their symptoms, the causes of these symptoms and directions of theu help-seeking behaviour. Confucianism has had the greatest impact on Chinese society and has influenced the practice of medicine for the past two thousand years. Brief descriptions of each philosophy lay the foundation for a discussion of Chinese medical history and help to put into perspective the illness experience of the Chinese immigrants studied hem. Conhicirinism Confuciianism is concemed with the proper way of conducting a puson's social Me. Since the First Han Dynasty (200 BC), the Chinese empemrs rrspected only Confucianism and rejected al1 other schools of philosophy. Thus, Confucianism became the dominant ideology infonning the minds of Chinese people, stnicturing their society, and becoming a vital component of the Chinese culture (Qui, 1988). Through theoretical and structural imperatives to develop a relation- oriented self, that is not only, \"socially responsive and dependent but also capable of asserting a selfdirected role in constnicting a social world\" (p. 30), Confucian values exerted the rnost pervasive influence in the shaping of Chinese character and behaviour (King & Bond. 1985). Confucianism sets the des and regulations for social interaction, stressing reciprocity and loyalty, benevoience and righteousness, self-respect, self-reliance, self-control, and face-saving. Reciprocity means that one treats others as one would like to be treated. Loyaity is the unquestionhg allegiance and total subordination to one's superion and eldea. Reciprocity and loyalty are the foundations on which is built the authoritarianisrn, filial piety and the closely-knit family structure of the Chinese. Benevolence is an awareness of others: one should tmt othen in a kind-hearted rnanner. To act righteously requires one to do what is appropriate according to benevolence. In the building of character, the exertion of res&a.int over emotions and an avoidance of extremes demonstrate self-respect and self-celiance. Face-saving, keeping an honourable family name, is a behavioural duty expected by both the family and community (Yang, C., 1967). In the Confucian tradition, people exist in relationship to others. In such a family oriented state, when the central unit of society is the family not the individual, authonty is autocratie and hierarchical. Confucius stresses five cardinal relationships (those between sovereign and subject, father and son, elder brother and younger brother, husband and de, and fnend and niend) and defines des of correct behavbur in te- of rights and responsibilities within each nlationship (Andecfs, 1938). Patemalism demands that a woman be obedient to her father when single, to her husband after dage, and to her son in old age (Song, 1985). 18 Three of the five cardinal relationships pertain to the faaiily with parents haviag the highest authority (Bond & Hwang, 1993). The principle of filial piety States: \"The body with its hair and skin is received fiom parents; do not cause it hm'' (Hsiao Ching, 1908, p. 16). One is indebted to one's parents for one's king and is responsible to the well-king of one's body. Status and authority in the Chinese fmily are not only based on filial piety, but also on age and the p~ciple of kinship proximity. Family members are amuiged into a hierarchic order by age, both, according to generation and chronological age (King Br Bond, 1985). Familial hierarchy determines nsponsibilities and obligations to othea in the farnily. Confucian philosophy strongly advocates the virtue of sacrificing individual needs for the good of the group (Bond & Hwang, 1993). Self-cultivation and self-discipline are the pillars of social identity and moral behaviour. The keys to survival. peace and happiness are hamiony, interdependence and loyalty to farnily (Xingwu, 1991). Because the family rather than the individual is the basic unit of society, the individual's actions are not his own and are, in fact, considered to be representative of the farnily, past, present and fiiture. It is a serious criticism to be told, \"There is a lack of virtue in your past eight generations of ancestors\" (Hsu, J., 1985). Thus, honour or stigma is not an individuai but rather a family matter. Face (lien in Chinese) is an important Conhician teaching that has a profound impact on the daily life of the Chinese people. Hu (1944) defined face in the Chinese culture as \"the confidence of society in the integrity of ego's moral chmcter, the loss of which makes it impossible for him to hction properly within the community. Lien is both a social sanction for enforcing moral standards and an intemaiized sanction\" (p. 45) [cited in Ho, D., 19761. Although the concept of fiice has long been recognized as a human universal by prominent scholars sudi as Go* (1955) and Ho (1976). the de- of concem is much higher for the Chinese thm other cultures (Redduig & Wong, 1993). \"A man neds a fece Lice a \u00fbce needs bark\" is stiil a cornmon saying 19 today and illustrates its importance. In contrast to the Western concept of face, which is oriented towards the individual, the Chinese concept of face is more concemed with the fmily (King & Bond, 1985). Children are taught at a young age that, \"Family shame should not spread outside,\" and the father is responsible for any face-losing incurred by his children because \"(Children being) fed but not taught (discipline) is the fault of the father.\" Over time, Confucius' rigidly defined behavioural codes of social relationship were reinforced through tradition and custom and the Chinese people became enmeshed in the Confufian doctrines. More than ever, after over two thousand years, Confician philosophy continues to be a potent force in shaping Chinese social behaviour. Chinese values and nomis contrast sharply with the North American culture which value competitiveness, independence and change (Arensberg & Niehoff, 1975; Song, 1985). These differences may render the Chinese immigrant at odds with the Canadian value system. Taoism Tao is the truth, the way of nature. Tao manifests itself in the change of night to day, the recurrence of seasons and the decay and growth that govems the universe. Taoism advocates the adherence to the way of nature in order to achieve harmony with the universe or macrocosm. 'nie principle of Yin and Yang is the basis of the universe .... Heaven was created by an accumulation of Yang; the Earth was created by an accumulation of Yin\" (Veith, 1967, p. 15). Yin is the ferninine qua\u00eeity - cold shady, passive and Yang is mascuiine - hot, bright and active. These two opposite, yet complementary, forces grow hm and with each other. Everythhg in the universe is believed to ociginate fiom them. The movement of the Yin and Yang forces fomis the vitai energy - 'qi' - in the universe. Qi (vital energy) is the foundation of Me and the motivating force for ai\u00ee organs to fiinction pmperiy, and it can be ciassified hto Yin and Yang with the 20 former having a conservation and maintenance fiinction and the later a defence and protective function (Zhang, E., 1990). Man, who is part of the universe, a microcosm, is aiso govemed by nature's two opposing forces and owes his life and health to the hamony and balance of natural forces. Following Tao and achieving harmony with Yin and Yang, man can attain good health and long life (Zhang, E., 1991). Taoism pmmoies non-action, detachment from the world and a harmonious personai life in relation to cosmological, nahiral and social environments (Lin, K. M., 1981). Taoist views of nature emphasize cyclical changes; for example, the cycle of birth and death and belief in spirits. Taoism advocates the search for the optimal way for an individual to live a harmonious personal life in relation to cosmological and natural spheres (Hsu, T. S., 1934). Taoist teaching provided the hdamental principles of traditionai Chinese medicine. Iiinesses are explained in tems of the balance of the Yin and Yang forces. Fatigue and weakness are symptoms resembling iiinesses that dted from a deficiency of the yang force. Due to the mode of diagnosis king ben@ or relatively social connotation fke, patients may readily accept an explanation of their illness in Taoist tems to avoid king stigmatize\u00e2 as lazy (resulting hm not able to work) or mentally ill (resulting hm lack of an organic medical diagnosis). Buddhism Buddhism, a religion originating in India, stresses the temporary nature and emptiness of life. Reincarnation and the cause and efKect of one's deeds are core beliefs. It is vital to accumulate good deeds in order to mach a higher state of king in the next life (Chen-Louie, 1983). Suffiering is considered to be the dinct effact of bad deed(s) committed eik in one's past, or in a previous life or lives. Bad deeds cornmittesi by one's ancestors may also be the cause 21 of suffiering. Unless this (or these) bad deed(s) are being \"worked cut\" 5y doing good deeds during one's own lifetime, the suffe~g is likely to continue in the next life (Qui, 1991). Suffering fiom a medically unexplained illness such as CF could be perceived by others as a punishment of bad deeds comrnitted by oneself or one's ancestors, thus rendering upon the individual and their family the stigma of moral corruption. Both individual and family efforts in working out bad deeds and perfomiing good deeds, including offerings in Buddhist temples to enlist help of a greater power to overcome karma, may be considered as appropriate ways in restoring one's health. History of Traditional Chineae Medicine The history of traditional Chinese medicine is an integral part of China's five-thousand-year old docurnented history. Like Chinese culture, it has constantly been influenced by religious, philosophical, environmental, and political changes over the centuries. Chinese history recorded that a great farmer by the name of Shen Ning (Iiterally translated into the God of agriculture) tasted different herbs in 2698 BC and this is believed to be the beginning of traditional Chinese medicine. He taught the people about the art of healing, and personally tested the properties of up to 70 medicinal herbs daily. Based on this selfsxperimentation and then tests on his patients, he wrote prescriptions to treat illnesses. in his old age, he composed Pen-Tsao Ching (Book of Herbs) in four volumes to keep a record of the herbai prescriptions for various ilinesses (Wang & Wu, 1973). The Chou dynasty. 722 BC, is one of the most glorious pends in Chinese history. Literature. art, religion, philosophy, governent and all the necessary elements for civilisation flourished and rieached a high degree of development This pefiod is caiied the Age of Philosophy in Chinese history* The study of medicine at tbat time was domlliated by the 22 scholastic subtleties of visionary philosophers: Lao Tm - founder of Taoisrn, Confucius - founder of Confucianism, and many othea. Various specuiations on the theory and causation of diseases were proposed, but the principle of Yin and Yang based on Taoism and its theory of cosmogony was by far the most influentid in Chinese medical history (Morse, 1978). The pnnciple of Yin and Yang which fomed the foundation of the theoretical and therapeutic practices of traditional Chinese medicine, was well illustrated in one of the oldest works of Chinese medical literature - The Yellow Emperor 's Classic of lh\u00eeernal Medicine (Veith, 1967). Even today this work dominates the thinl\u00fcng of traditionai Chinese medicine practitioners and lay people (Wu, 1982). The Yellow Emperor (2696-2598 BC) was one of China's most famous legendary den. The Yellow Emperor f Clossic, which consists of 18 volumes, is estimated to have been written around 3 BC by several prominent physicians over a long period of time, and was antedated to the the of the Yellow Emperor to enhance its value (Veith, 1967; Chan, S., 1981). Due to Confucian teaching in the Filial Classic, that the body is a sacred inheritance fiom one's parents and therefore not to be mutilated in any way, dissection of the human body was seldom practised by ancient Chinese physicians (Veith, 1967; Wang & Wu, 1973). Ancient drawings of human anatomy were usuaily a by-product of acts of cruelty and curiosity of an emperor's misde, especially during the Shen Dynasty (1800-1 122 BC) and the Later Han Dynasty (206 BC- AD 100). During the First Han Dynasty (2nd Century, BC), Coafucianism was established as the political orthodoxy of the Chinese state. Thus, medicai writings were ent\u00fcely philosophical (Porket, 1976). Chg Chung-Ching (AD 196-220), later known as the Hippocrates of China, inaugurated a new era h Chinese medicine. Diseases were studied more hm a clinid standpoint, with empbasis behg laid on the physical si- symptoms and course of an illness, 23 the methods of treatment, and the action of dmgs. Chang Chung-Ching was the author of ten medical books with topics ranging fiom typhoid fever remedies to prescriptions for women's diseases. Ingredients of traditional Chinese medicine include not oniy herbs but also insects, animal parts, and even Stones (Sivin, 1987). Around the same period as Chang Chung-Ching, another physician, Hua T'o (circa 190), was well known as a very skilful surgeon. He discovered the use of anaesthetics through acupuncture by first Qing them on himself, then on his farnily . Even today, he is often wonhipped as the God of Surgery; \"An alive again Hua T'o\" is a compliment Chinese would bestow on a brilliant physician. The practice of traditional Chinese medicine has continwd to the present day, without major changes, since the writing of the Yellow Emperor 's Classic of Interna1 Medicine, and the death of Chang Chung-Ching and Hua T'o. The standard methods of diagnosis relied solely on observation, auscultation (with the physician's senses only, rather than the use of any instrument), interrogation, and palpation. Treatments were primariiy herbs used internally or externally, acupuncture and massage (Liu, 1974; Unschuld, 1985; Veith, 1967). This Iack of progress in Chinese medicine over a period of more than 2,000 years is largely the result of the veneration of age and tradition, embodied in Confucian teaching. Anything old and traditional was respected and anything new was never considered better than the old (Pak, 1977). Physicians looked backwards, drawing on their basic texts for knowledge and allowed knowledge to accumulate through the\u00f9 experience treating patients. They celied on tirne-tested medicine, rather than trying to accelenite this process through artificial situations, such as clinid trials in Western medicine (Christakis, 1992). Traditional Chinese medicine received a major blow in the early nineteenth century when China's door was fod open by Western countnes (Latourette, 1929). Medical missionaries hm couniries fbt au\u00efved in China in 1834, introduc\u00eeng Westem medicine to China 24 (Young, 1973). The dying Ching Dynasty suddenly realized that China was not the centre of the world, as the Chinese were led to believe for 4,000 years. The old empire was actually quite behind in the areas of defence, industry and science. With the founding of the Republic of China in 1912, al1 the old traditions of China were forsaken and radical changes (westemization) occurred in every walk of life. Western medicine was adopted as the oniy officia1 medicine for China by the new govemment. Traditional medicine was deemed as unscientific by Western- trained Chinese physicians. There were numerous attempts on the part of a number of the leaders in the National Medical Association in 1929 and the Chinese Medical Association in 1949 to ban traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, but these were met with strong tesistance fiom traditional medicine groups and users (Wu, 1959; Yip, 1983). However, despite its loss in status in the professionai community, traditional medicine is st\u00fcl favoured by most people in China (Holden, 1964). Because of the lack of Western-trained physicians and uIsufficient medical resources for a large population, the total abandonment of Chinese traditional medicine was impossible. Mer the Cornmunists took over in 1949 and established the People's Repubiic of China, the movement to combine ttaditional and Western medicine begm with unprecedented support fiom the government (Lee, R., 1980; Li, C., 1975). As for nationalist Taiwan, Westem medicine is still the only official health care system, and traditional Chinese medicine is kept as a subordinate system. Nevertheless, the steady demand for traditional Chinese mediciw and the promotion of the World Health Organhtion to integrate both systems led to the recent examination of the possibility of integrating both systems in Taiwan (Chi, 1994). Plura\u00fcsm in heakh beliefs and practices has become normative in Chinese perspectives on illness (Kleinman, 1980) and this approach has ban cornmonplace in most Cbinese communities where traditionai and Western medicine are both available. The Evolution of Traditional Chinese Medicine Philosophical Framework Just as Conf\u00f9cianism dictated the social structure, Taoism infonned the development of tradi tional C hinese medicine. Traditional C hinese health beliefs and practices have continued to the present day without major changes since the wnting of the Yellow Emperor S Classic of Irz\u00eeernal Medicine. With major influences hm Taoism, this Classic provided a theoretical fnunework for the interpretation and treatment for illnesses (Veith, 1967). Traditional Chinese medicine is holistic and focuses mainly on function rather than structure. \"Disease is nirely localized but genemlly affects the entire human being\" (Veith 1975, p. 665). In traditional Chinese medicine, qi (vital energy) and blood are two important concepts within the theory of Yin and Yang. Qi is the energy extracted from food ingested and air inhaled. It circulates through the Ching-lo system (the meridian tracts) to provide vital energy to al1 parts of the body and is regarded as the motivating force for ail organs to hinction properly (Zhang, E., 1990). Blood is the solvent of qi and it brings nutrients to different parts of the body by circulation. Qi is the 'controller' of blood and the two are not separable; qi improves the function of blood and aids in the proper circulation of blood (Qin, 1992). Blood is regarded as the more substantive fonn of the qi circulation (Lin. T., 1989), while qi can only be detected through its hctions (Qin, 1 992). Deficiency of blood will not produce pi, and vice versa (Zhang, E., 1 990). The mind-body dichotomy is a product of Western culture and is uot pervasive in Chinese culture (Kuo & Hopkins Kavanagh, 1994). Unlike Western medicine, traditional Chinese medicine does not differentiate physiological fiom psychologicai f\u00f9nctions and organs are not viewed ana\u00eeomicai sense. Orgm are comidered as anatomie-physiological- psychologicai systems that comtitute the total existence of an individual as a biopsychosocial system (Lin, K. M.. 1981). The internai organs in traditionai Chinese medicine have the same 26 mes as in Western medicine but are not viewed as having the same composition and hction (Porkert, 1974). Intemal organs are viewed as centres for both psychological and physical functions; thus, emotional disturbances are closely associated with dysfunction of organs (Xu, 1987). The heart, kidneys and lungs are of special importance in the regulation of both physical and psychologicai functions. The heart holds shen (spirit or Mnd) which govems al1 psychological functions. The kidneys are the reservoir of ching (essence or the purified, concentrated qi) which play a vital role in reproduction and growth, and the lungs are involved in the formation of qi (Lin, K. M., 198 1; Yam, 1997). Each of the five major emotions is purportcd to be located in a specific interna1 organ: happiness in the heart, desire in the kidneys, worry in the lungs, anger in the liver, and fear in the spleen. Any imbalance of emotions wodd dishub the f'uaction of the parallel organ, and a dysf'unctional organ explains an ernotional imbalance (Kuo & Hopkins Kavanagh, 1994). Etiology of ILlness In general, ilhess, or the imbaiance of Yin and Yang, cm be the cesult of one or more of the Following three main causes: extemai, intemal and neither extemai not intemal. Extemal refers to environmental factors, such as poor living conditions, climate changes and invasion by the six licentious elements (Liuy0n) - wind, cold heat, darnpness, aridity and fk (the presence of these elements are not restricted to the extemal enntonrnent but embedded in many foods). Intemal refers to physical factors, both hereditary and congenital, and experiences involving dishmony in sociai activities or extrernes in the seven emotions (qiqing) - joy (xi), anger (mu), wony (si), Neithet to injuries and poisoning (Chen, 1986; Veith, 1967; Yam, 1997). Any of the above causes cm lead to a pattern of dishamony or imMauce of Yin and Ymg. When Yin and Yang are unbaIanced for prolonged @ods of time or in an extnme mannet the 27 resulting transformations may be quite drastic. An extreme dishannony means that the deficiency of one force cannot continue to support the excess of the other force to allow the formation of qi. The resulting change rnay be a rebalancing, or, if that is not possible, either the transformation into opposites or the cessation of existence. For example, when a patient has a very high fever with much perspiration (considered to be an excess of Yang or fire), the patient may be in danger of suddenly going into shock (an extreme Yin or cold condition). This is because it is believed that Yang cannot continue to exist in such an extreme relationship to Yin without some transformation occurring. Either a rebalancing must take place with medical intervention or a radical transformation, i.e. shock, will occur. If a rebalancing is not accomplished, Yin and Yang will separate and existence will cease - i.e. death (Veith, 1967; Zhang, E., 199 1). Symptom and Dialnosiil Symptoms of the dydhction of Yin and Yang, the circulation of qi in particular, are organized and recognized according to the meridian system which serves as a base for the diagnosis and treatment of ilinesses (Lin, K. M., 1981). The standard methods of diagnosis relied solely on observation, auscultation (with the physician's senses only, without the use of any instrument), interrogation, and palpation (Yan, B., L 99 1). The interrogation and proper interpretation of patients' explanations and the expressions of their symptoms play an important role in the diagnosis of theu illness. Since traditionai Chinese medicine and the Chinese language's expression of illness are characterized by concepts of viscerai organs, patients kquently describe their problems in terms of organs, even when it may be emotional in nature. Among the commonly used expressions are \"injured hem\" meanhg 1973). Effive caregivers 28 familiarize themselves with the \u00fbue meaning of these expressions, rather than taking them at face value. Treatment The pattern of disharmony - the deficiency or excesses of Yin and Yang - provides the framework for treatment, which attempts to restore harmony or baiance to the individual (Wu, J. & Chen, 1993; Zhang, E., 1991). The Yia and Yang theory has broad application into the daily life of Chinese health maintenance where herbs and foods are classified and extremes of emotions are avoided (Lin, T., 1989). Ail treatments are aimed at restoring the human body to harmony and balance, as opposed to correcthg specific pathological changes (Lin, K. M., 198 1). Major types of treatment include herbs wd internally or extemaiiy, acupuncture, moxa (application of buming herbs over acupuncture points tather than use of a needie) and qi-hg (massage, exercise, and \u00fcansfer of qi corn therapist to patient). Depending on the nature of illness, these treatments can be used alone or in combination with othen. With the help of family or fnends, self-medication or the use of other treatment modalities is common practice amoag the Chinese. This usually takes place with or without assistance fiom tra\u00eened practitioners (Qin, 1 992; Yan, B ., 1 99 1 ; Zhang , E., 1 990). in addition, none of these treatments are regulated by the Canadian govenunent; none, except acupuncture (if ac\u00f9ninistered by an Ontario licensed physician who has added acupuncture to their Western medical knowledge), is covered by govemment health insurance. Fatigue and Weakness /II Tditional Chinese Medicine Fatigue and weakness are the symptoms of the n< (deficiency) of qi and blood, or the imbdance of the Yin and Yang forces. A lack in Ymg would especidy deprive the body of the positive energy it requires and hatha weaken it. Deficiency of qi would lead to th Wod 29 . . decline of the organs which could be caused by overstrainuig or aging, irregular Ag habits, prolonged consumption of cold drinks or foods, extremes in emotions, overthinkhg, excessive sexual activities and chronic illness, resulting in the symptoms of listlessness, lassitude, fatigue and weakness (Yan, B., 199 1 ; Zhang, E., 1990). Among the organs, the kicheys, are responsible for the preservation of qi and essence. Excessive sexual activity and prolonged illness can lead to the impairment of the reinforcing and astringent functions of the kidneys and, in tum, the deficiency of qi. Malfunction of the kidneys would lead to impotence, infertility, growth retardation, lack of strength, fatigue and weakness (Yam, 1997). A deficiency of blood would lead to fatigue, vertigo, and insomnia which can be a result of overseaining one's body and mind through overwork, \"overthinking\" (Zhang, E., 199 1, p. 328) and wonying, overstrain of organs throug& over eating and Urepuiar diet, or the deficiency in the Yang force due to over indulgence in sexual activities by the male (hg, E., 199 1). Based on the traditional Chinese medicina1 interpretation of the cause of fatigue and weakness, and the influence of traditional Chinese medicine on the Chinese, it is postdated in this study that Chinese patients who der fiom CF and weakness may adopt some of the traditional interpretations of their condition. Summarizing Conclusioii A review of the development of CF and CFS, culanal factors, impact of migration, and traditionai Chinese values and beliefs reveaied the potential influences of these issues on the illness experience of immigrant Chinese patients. Research bas shown that hedth professionais who understand local interpretations of the cause, course and treatment of ilinesses have better communication with their patients and increased cornpliance by them. Tky are also better able to buiid alliances with the comm~ties they serve (Weiss, 1988). With the inauence of both 30 traditional and Westem health belief systems, it is anticipated that Chinese immigrants may hold health beliefs and practices of both systems, and, in tum, may seek help for their ailments fiom both traditional Chinese and Westem health practitioners simultaneously. Not only may this render them at odds with the Canadian health care system, but, adjusting to a new environment with different cultural values and languages, may also pose tremendous stress on this group of patients. Certain illnesses Ieave patients and their families with unbearable stigma. Understanding the health beliefs, meanings of illness, stigma and help-seeking behaviour of this population could enhance the health care worker's ability io provide culnually sensitive and appropriate care to this large group of new Canadians. An appreciation of patients' needs with respect to how they perceive and define syrnptoms will dso enable health care plannea and educatoa to design health prograrns that are culturally congruent and meaningf\u00fbl to their clients of Chinese ongin and the multiculairal community as a whole. Research Objectives The objectives of this study were to explore in Chinese immigrants with CF and weakness: The patterns of distress (symptoms), stigrna, perceived cause(s) and help-seeking behaviour. The intluence and impact of Chinese cultural concepts on the patterns of distress, stigma, perceived causes and help-seeking behaviour. The impact of migration on perceived caw(s), stigma and help-seeking behaviour. The interreiationships among their pattern of distress, stigma, perceived cause and help seekhg behaviour. Chapter \u00efI\u00ef THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK AND REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE The cluucal features associated with medically unexplained CF and CFS, such as severe and persistent fatigue, muscle and joint pain, headache, sore throat, fever, weakness, dizziness, concentration difficulties, and memory loss, are largely subjective (Holmes et al., 1988). If health care workers are to understand and help patients with the\u00f9 sufEering, they will need to attend to this subjective iiiness experience. The work of Kleinman (1980), Gofian (1963) and Kleinman and CO-workers (1995) on the explanatory model of illness, and on stigma were chosen as the theoretical fiamework for this study because they take into account the cultural context of research participants' subjective illness experience. This is piuucularly relevant in this study in which ail participants are first generation Chinese immigrants to Canada. The theoretical \u00fbamework and selected variables in the EMIC (Weiss, 1997) - an instrument based on Kleinrnan's (1980) explanatory model of iliness - also served as a guide for the liteniture review of this study. Theoretical Framework The theoreticai fhmework of this study is grounded in Neinman's (1980) Explanatory Mode1 of lllness - a mode1 developed hm extensive research with the Chinese population over a decade. The work of Gofnnan (1963). and Kleinman and CO-workers (1995) on individual stigma/fdy stigma aiso contributeci to t&e theoretical framwork dirreting this research. To k consistent with the tenet of qualitative research which aims at discovery, the theoreticai f'tsmewodc serves as an inpuiry guide stnicture. Illness Explanatory Mode1 Eliciting patients' explanatory models of illness is a means of analyzing their understanding of their condition, and can serve as a base to teach clinicians to elicit the \"native's point of view\" during their clinical work (Kleinrnan et al., 1978). Kleinman (1980) defines explanatory mode1 as the meaning people attribute to their illness as they try to explain it. Explanatory models contain explanations of any or al1 of the following aspects of an illness episode: (1) etiology; (2) time and mode of onset of symptoms, (3) pathophysiology, (4) course of sickness, and (5) treatment of illness episodes (Kleinman, 1978). The cultural construction of illness produces different interpretations of the causes of ihesses, which influence the presentation of symptoms and the helpseeking behaviours of patients and families (Kleinman, 1980). To obtain help for their illness, Kleinman (1978) purports that patients and families often must deal with the three social arenas of the health care systems: the populat, the professional and the folk. The popular arena is comprised mainly of the farnily context of sickness and cm, as well as social and community ne\u00eeworks. Most ilinesses are managed in this anna as are the decisions reganiing treatment choices. The mass media of the Canadian Chinese community, play a significant role in this arena in the distribution of health related information to their community. The professional arena consists of professional scientific medicine. The folk arena consists of non-professional healing specialists. Traditionai Chinese medicine practitionea in Caiiada coastitute this arena. Theu practice is often part of the indigenous culture and weli accepted with\u00f9i the community (se+ section on Traditionid Chinese Concepts of Health and Iliness, p. 16 ) Kleinman (1980) maintains that the heaith aire system is an integral part of al1 cultures, and that illness is articdated as a culturai idiom in al1 three hdth cm system. Culaires establish pystematic relationsbips among beW of disease don, the ercpaience of 33 symptoms, specific patterns of illness behaviour, decisions concerning helpseeking, actual therapeutic practices and evaluations of therapeutic outcomes. The ideologies of al1 three arenas contribute to the patients' general beliefs about sickness and health care in different social and cultural systems. General heaith beliefs, therefore, exist independent of and prior to a given e pisode of sichess; explanatory models, although infiuenced by these beliefs, are speci fic responses to a particular illness episode (Kleinman, 1978). A patient's explanatory model is partly conscious and partly unconscious. It is based on a cognitive system that directs reasoning dong certain lines. In responding to an illness episode, the individual integrates views fiom the health ideologies of the popular, professiional and folk arenas. Therefore, a patient's explanatory model contains the often changing, ambiguous, tacit meanings of their illness, shaped by the nature of the illness, its impact on the sick person and family, and beliefs, noms and interests that constitute the day-to-day world of the sick person in his particular social situation. Illness is situated in both a culnual and social context (Kleinman, 1980, 1988). As demonstrated in the f\u00efndings of the pilot study of the curent research the adaptation to Canadian life as an immigrant influences the participants' illness experience. Therefore, the impact of migration was included in the theoretical fnunework of this study. Ind\u00eevidual and Family Stigma Gohan (1963) notes that the Greeks, \"originated the term stigrna to refer to bodily signs designed to expose somethhg unusud and bad about the mord status of the signifier.\" Stigma is iaherent in a relationship between the 'aod' and the substandard 'other' (p.1). From a sociologicai perspective, Gofnnan (1963) fodated the concept of stigma as a psychological alteration which produces a \"spoiled identityn and he outlines the subtieties of how this process proceeds. He focuses his attention on the idea of share\u00e2 or tramferreci stigma, which affects not just the individual, but .Ise hidm hmily. Gofian (1963) defined a person who is stigmatized as: \"possessing an attribute that makes hun different nom othen in the category of persons available for him to be, and of a less desirable kind - in the extreme, a person who is quite thoroughly bad, or dangerous, or weak. He is thus reduced in our minds from a whole and usual person to a tainted, discounted one. Such an attribute is a stigma\" (p. 2-3). It is not the attribute, per se, that is a stigma, but the \"definition of the situation\" or the social perception of the attribute which deems it a stigma Stigma must be seen in tems of what Gofnnan (1963) calls \"language of relationships,\" that is, in the social context. Goffman (1963) suggested that there are three types of stigma: (1) physical stigma of defonnity, (2) \"tribal stigma of race, nation, and religion,\" and (3) \"blemishes of individual chanicter perceived as weak will, domineering or unnaturd passions, treacherous and rigid beliefs, and dishonesty, these king inferred fiom a known record of, for example, mental disorder, imprisonment, addiction, alcoholism, homosexuality, unemployment, suicida1 attempts, and radical political behaviour\" u.4). The effect of these stigmata are the same; they interfere with what othetwise might have been a normal social relationship, because of their \"undesired differentness from what we had anticipated\" (p.5). \"By definition, of course, we believe the puson with a stigma is not quite humant' (p.6). SufEerers of CF and weakness within the Chinese culture fit well into this typology since there is stigma associated with the perceived lack of self- discipline and laziness at\u00fbibuted to moral weakness, and king an immigrant and visible minority who nias the risk of having hisrnet ethnic group labelled as lazy or king a burden to KIeinman and coiieagues' (1995) research on epilepsy in China has shed new light on the concept of stigma, especially in Cbinese commuaities. uistead of viewiag it as a psychological alteration of 'spoiled identityt) this reformuiation of stigma is embedded in social and cultural processes. These mearchers contend tha\u00ee stigma is an individuai morai category in the W\u00abd but 35 that moral blame is not applied to the Chinese patient alone. It extends to the entire family in the Chinese context. They argue that since the individual is culhirally constnicted as a relational-self, the indigenous Chinese mode1 is \"a sociosomatic one that hes intersubjective delegitimation. not spoiled identity, as the central process\" @. 1328). Since the person is cons\u00fbucted as a relational-self in the Chinese culture, delegitimation of the person and the family can affect the whole family's chances of marriage, livelihood, and al1 aspects of social life. Over the long-terni, patient and fmily are delegitimatized, regarded as morally bankrupt, and viewed as capable of bankrupting othea. The ruins of social relations can lead to ruined lives. Renqing, favour, the affect central to social exchange, cari neither be given nor ceceived. To lose face, to be unable to allocate renqing, to experience delegitimation means that the patients and their families are ostmcized (Kleinman et al., 1995). Responses to Stigma Gofnnan (1963) maintains that stigmatized individuals share many problems and utilize common strategies to overcome these problems. He discusses three options open to them to avoid interacting with bbnormals\" in situations in which they are at a disadvantage. One option to avoid derogation is to associate only with those who possess the same stigma, or to associate only with those \"normals\" who are sympathetic to their problems, and for whom the stigma is of no consequence. Another option is for the stigrnatized individuai to hide his stigrnatized identity, Le. to pess for 'homiai\" (the extent to which this is possible depends on the nature of the stigma). A third option is to \"manage\" the \"audience\" by playing on the meanings that bbnonnals'' give to his condition (p.9). For example, by agreeing with \"nomals\" that one's fatigue is the result of hard work. One of the key cuitmai values of the Chinese is that of avoiding \"shame\" or \"loss of ftce.\" Fnw a very early age, Chinese behaviours are mouidcd by what it is believed people WU view as 36 \"good\" rather than what the individual believes to be \"right.\" One is expected to act in a way that brings glory and respect to one's family, clan and country (Kendall, 1989). Cbese people have a tradition of bearing hardships and withstanding hard work. They tend to have a close knit family and social system, and a strong sense of interdependence (Xu, 1987). The Chinese consider leisure tirne a lwury and remaining idle a cardinai sin (Kendall, 1989). Thus, fatigue may be perceived as weakness in one's character or as laziness, which could reflect badly on the family. Concluding Comments For the purpose of this study, there are merits in both Gofhan's (1963) and Kleinman and colleagues' (1995) concephializations of stigma. Both Gofian (1963) and Kleinman and colleagues (1995)' address the social dimension of stigma, though the latter emphasize a more indigenous view of stigma pertaining to the Chinese culture. Chinese patients who sufEer fiom CF and weakness fit well into the three types of stigma proposed by Goffinan (1963). Unlike the Christian teaching that stresses individual responsibility to bring glory to God, the ultimate responsibilities for a Chinese, based on the four steps outlined in Confucius' teaching, are (1) improving oneself, (2) looking &er one's family, (3) serwig one's country and (4) bringing peace to the world. Thus, bringing glory to one's family and kinship is fiuidarnental to other vhes. Delegitimation of fdly and the social network is, therefore, the biggest assault the person cm experience. This research incorporated both Gohan's (1963) and Kleinman and colleagues' (1995) views of stigma as a guide to study subjects' perceived stigma. Review of the Literature The theoreticai fiamework describai above and selected variables in the EMIC (Weiss, 1997). an instrument developed based on Neinman's (1980) Explanatory Mode1 of IUness, serveci as an organizing Eramework for the literature review of ihis dy. Both the KIejnman 37 (1980) and the Weiss (1997) fhmeworks were developed hm research with patients in Eastern cultures. Kieinman's (1980) mode1 consolidated his extensive research and clinical experience for over a decade with Chinese patients in Taiwan, China, and the US. The EMIC (Weiss, 1997) was the product of comprehensive studies in South Asia, with an adaptation for researching the Chinese population deveioped by a group of experts in the Chinese culture. Therefore, the KleiNnan (1980) Model and the EMIC (Weiss, 1997) are most suited to serve as an organizing fiamework for the literature review of this study. The major headhgs chosen were: patterns of distress, stigma, perceived cause. and help-seeking behaviour. Research in CF has largely focused on its etiology, prevaience, the psychological characteristics of iis sufferers, its relationship with other medicd and psychiatrie ilinesses, and its diagnostic and treatment modalities. Almost al1 subjects in these studies are Caucasians froni North Amenca or Europe. Only a few studies have investigated variables such as the patterns of distress, stigma, perceived causes and help-seeking behaviour of patients sutTering fiom CF. No previous research was found concemhg the problems to be addressed in this study in the Chinese immigrant population. Therefore, for the ppurpse of this study, research that explores the patterns of distress, stigma, perceived causes, and heIp-seeking behaviour of non-Chinese patients dering from CF and weakness (includhg studies of CFS and nemasthenia) and studies that explore the Chinese experience with other illnesses were reviewed. Dwelling amongst members of the same ethnic rninority group cm buffer direct prejudice fiom the larger community through social support, Nevertheless, the experiences of being a member of an immigrant and cultural minority group can produce adverse effects on one's mental health (Halpern, 1993). Despite the strong presence of Chinese immigrants in the Orrater Toronto Am, redts fiam this study's pilot test of 10 patients indicated that their experiences as new immigrants played an important mie in how they paccived aad CO@ with theh iiiness. 38 Research on the impact of migration was included in the literature review of the present study, in as much as it is an integral feature of their social context. Patterns of Distress A review of the literature, which follows showed that patients with CF and weakness suffer fiom multiple symptoms of physical and psychosocial distress. Those patients who reported more medically unexplained physicai distress were bund to be more likely to have cumnt or lifetime psychiatric disorders. A qualitative study on nedenia was conducted by Arthur and Joan Kleinman (1982; 1985a) at Changsha, the People's Republic of China, shortly after the conclusion of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). One hunbd patients with a diagnosis of neurasthenia (52 men, 48 women) were interviewed at their first visit to a psychiatric out-patient clinic. Patients' narrative accounts of their illness experiences and explanatory models of illness (includuig cause, course, treatrnent and anticipated consequences) were elicited with a semi-stnictured questionnaire, called the Illmss Narrative inte~ew. A mean number of 6.8 cornplaints were reported by each patient, of which 5 were somatic, and 1.8 was psychological. Seventy-eight percent of the patients held that their disorder was wholly or partially organic and only 22% regarded their illness as wholly or partialiy psychological. Most of the subjects ascribed the cause of their illness to the terror, oppression and loss they had experienced during the Cultural Revolution. Symptoms were expressed ditough the symbolic nature of bodily complaints, and the centrai cultural metaphor of 'qi'. The Cultural Revolution was perceived to have caused a deprivation of this vital energy to the social fabric as a whole. Somatic symptoms, such as pain, were consi\u00e2ered to be both in the body and in sttrained relationships in families and the worlrplace. Since traditional Chinese medicine attri'butes health to the harmonious baiance 39 between macrocosmic environment and the microcosm of the body, symptoms such as dizziness and malaise were interpreted as a disturbance of this balance by these neurasthenic patients - a symbol of their alienation tiom their bodies, their social contexts and the political process. This study articulated the indigenous view of the Chinese patients through their narratives. However, questions rnay be raiseci about the validity of the data because of the following: (1) the political climate at the time of the study. The study was conducted shortly afler the Cultural Revolution, in which millions were persecuted because they held politically incorrect ideologies. Research participants might have limited the\u00f9 revelations to the researchers to what they considered to be politically safe. (2) The perceived role of Kleinman and his colleague by the Chinese at the research site. The researchers were foreigners hm the US who came to an impoverished part of China, which had once benefited fiom the US, especially in medical care (Holden, 1964). The US, at that time, was perceived to be the world's most capitalist country, long held as the enemy of the communist ideal state. Based on the high degree of co-operation the Kleinmans obtained fiom their Chinese research collaborators, one could speculate that they were perceived by the Chinese more as saviours who could rescue them from their derings, like theu predecessors at the tum of the century, than as researchers, which is an unfhmiliar role in many underdeveloped parts of the world. In a study of the psychia\u00fbic morbidity and ethnography of subjects with CF and weakness in Hong Kong, Yu (1994) intervieweci 100 (75 female) Chinese outpatients with medically unexplained fatigue in a primary care setting. She reported that 72 of them claimed that they suffered hm wurasthenia None of her subjects cailed their problem CFS, and nearly ail of them stated that they had never heard of CFS before. hmnia (20%), somatic pains (20%) and headache (16%) were the most fkequently cited symptoms. Fatigue was an iafiepuent cornplaint and not udy thought of as a medicd pmblem. In f~t oniy 5 patients reporteci fatigue and only 40 2 patients indicated weakness as their most troubling symptom. Those subjects who did not cite fatigue as one of the most troubling symptoms believed that it might reasonably be expected in a busy city such as Hong Kong, where the determined acquisition of financiai security and power through the application of hard work was normative. When asked, they usually identified fatigue as the consequence of insomnia or pain, rather than as a primary problem. Fifty percent of the patients attributed their fatigue to a physical cause, 32% identified a psychological cause and 18% to an interpersonal or social reason. Subjects' perceived stigma associated with their CF and weakness or help-seeking behaviour were not assessed. Subjects of this study were outpatients of a govemment furided hospital where fiee medical care was provided; these patients were mainly fiom a lower socio-economic neighbourhood and were less educated than the general population in Hong Kong. Thus, fmdings from this study may not be generalizable to other Chinese communities, but can serve as a reference for the present study, in which al1 subjects were boni in China, Hong Kong or Southeast Asia. Research with largely Caucasian CF subjects shows that dificulty with sleep is one of the most dishubing syrnptoms. Farmer and colleagues (1995) found that 79% of the 100 CFS patients they studied suffered nom sleep disorder. Moldofsky (1989) reported that patients with CF were awake more than twice as long as controis and took more than twice as long as controis to fd asleep. A case-control snidy of 12 patients with CF and 12 healthy controls conducted by Momss and CO-workers (1993) showed that the rnajority (7) with CF had sleep disorders, which might have contributed to their daytime fatigue. hpp and colleagues (1993) studied 72 CF patients and found that they had much more sleep disturbances compared to patients with multiple sclerosis and healthy controls. CF patients slept more Iightly and felt drowsy upon awakening. However, ditlierences in measurement metbods in these studies affect the actuai sevetity of observed sleep difncuities and Limit comparability of findings. 41 Studies have also showed that CF patients with medically unexplained physical symptoms are vulnerable to psychiatric disorders. Wessely and CO-worken (1996) compared 214 CF patients with their \"non-fatigued\" counterparts in a primary care setting. These researchers assessed relationships among psychological symptoms, past and current psychiatric disorder, functional impairment, somatic symptoms and CF, using instruments such as the Fatigue Questio~aire, General Health Questionnaire, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Checklist, Revised Clinical Interview Schedule, and Somatic Symptom Checklist. The subjects were also asked about previous episodes of possible psychiatric disorder and treatment. The researchers reported that patients with CF were at greater risk for psychiatric disorders, mainly depression (60% versus 19%). Amongst CF patients, there was a \u00fcnear relationship between somatic and psychological symptoms (r0.34, n=185, p<O,OO 1). In an earlier study by Katon and Russo (1992), 285 CF patients were assessed with the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic interview Schedule and four self-rating questionnaires assessing psychological distress, functional disability, and the tendency to ampli@ symptoms. This study also found that patients with the highest number of medically unexplained physical symptoms had an exceptionally high rate of current and lifethe psychiatric disorders. Both of these studies employed well validated instruments, but the experience and the impact of their illness on the lives of the subjects were not assessed. A study was conducted by Buchwald and CO-workers (1997a) in a CF referral clinic to deterrnine the efficacy of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), to detect psychological distress. Two hundred and eighty-one (95% Caucasian) CF patients with a psychiatnc illness of duration between 6 months and 39 years (med.2) were screened using the sefireport GHQ and a stntctuted psychiatric interview. It was found that 35% of these patients had a cunent psychiatric disorder and 82% had a Wehe psychiatric disoldcr. A longer illacss duration was 42 associated with a greater severity of fatigue and a shorter length of illness was associated with greater psychological distress. The researchen postulated that patients had developed strategies over the to cope with the psychological distress associated with their CF. They reported that the GHQ showed excellent intemal consistency with an alpha coefficient of 0.93. The GHQ achieved the best sensitivity (0.69-0.76) and specificity (0.5 1-0.62) for current psychiatnc diagnosis using a threshold score of 12; indicating that patients scoting 42 are less likely to have a psychiatric disorder. These researchen concluded that the GHQ is a quick and inexpensive tool to assess psychiatric disorden among patients with CF. However, the applicability of GHQ to different culturai or language groups has not been established, and how much the findings fiorn this study can be generalized to CF patients who are wn-Caucasian Arne~can is yet to be detemined. Furthemore, meames such as the GHQ do assess psychological distress, but they do not reveai the qualitative nature of the patient's experience. There is an abundance of literature which addresses the symptoms of CF. However, most studies have not explored the meaning of such symptoms to the patients or how these symptoms affect theu lives, particularly, in patients who are immigrants. Stigma A review of the literature pertaining to the Chinese perception of illness-related stigma showed that mental illness, rather than physical illness, dominated the literature. Mental iliness carries a tremendous stigma in different Chinese communities. in mainland China, people are reluctant to discuss their feelings and reveal mood symptoms to others because mental disorders are st\u00fci highiy stigmatized (Young & Xia, 1993; Xu, 1987). Pearson and Phillips (1994) purporteci that there is Little community tolerance for mentaily il1 people in China, and that such patients and thtK fdes are heavily stismatipd. This stigma particuiarly affi the Mie 4 3 chances of young unmarried people, and families often go to great lengths to hide the illness. Compared to the Arnerican general public, American Chinese immigrants have been reported to be particuiarly negative in their attitudes toward people with mental disorders (Chan, F. et al., 1988). To date, the causes of CF lack a concrete physiological explanation; one may speculate that Chinese CF patients are prone to the kind of perceived stigma endured by their counterparts who sufEer fiom mental iHnesses. In a study of depressed Chinese patients in general practice in Hong Kong, Cheung, F. and colleagues (1980-1981) noted that a majority of patients complained primarily of somatic symptoms. The researchers suggest that Chinese patients conceal their feelings because of the powerful social stigma that attaches to mental illness in their culture. Physical symptoms are substituted for depressive symptoms, so as to be less stigrnatizing and therefoce more tolerable. However, when directly asked, these patients oh admitted to the presence of affective symptoms. These researchers maintain that for most working class Chinese who are used to more concrete modes of expression, conceptualization at the psychic level may seem too abstract. They contend that there is no systematic data to support the alleged Chinese tendency for somatization, as suggested by Kleinman ( L 977). Epilepsy is a condition which is stigmatized and its etiology remains controversial in China. Meinman and CO-workers (1995) studied 80 patients suffering fkom epilepsy in China. A semi- structured interview scheduie was used to elicit the ewriences of mess and treatment, as well as the impact of the iilness on the patient and family. Perceived causes of epilepsy reportecl by patients and their families included: heredity, head injury, king possessed by dernoos, geomaacy, poverty, overwork and fright. These perceived causes carry impiications about the moral statu of the fhly, and thus contribute to the \u00fcemendous stigma attached to the ilines. The bunkn of epilepsy on the motional, fmancial and f\u00e9miiial, maritai and interpersonal 44 relationships is severe. Stigrna (afFecting both the patient and family) and shame, associated with loss of mord status and low selfssteem, were wide-spread among those who participated in the research. Because of the fear that their entire family would be disgraced, family members oflen concealed the diagnosis, dropped out of treatment and hid their epileptic members at home. Although the researchea contended that the findings of this study could be applied to other chronic conditions, they should be applied to CF with caution, as epilepsy may be a far more \"visible\" illness than CF. More study is needed to examine the role of stigma in the illness expenence of patients with a poorly defuicd illness such as CF. Studies reviewed thus far suggest that the impact of stigma on patients' illness expenence is severe with illnesses that lack a somatic etiology. However, the influence of a culturally defined concept such as stigrna on how patients perceive fatigue or seek help is not well researched, especially with the Chinese immigrant population. Perceived Cause Although most patients with CF and wealcness hold pluralistic views and multiple attributions of their illness, as demonstrated in the studies of Kleinman and CO-workers (1982, 1985a) and Yu (1994), they still tend to attribute the\u00f9 illness to a physical cause, and to minimizc the mle of psychosocial factors in their ilhess. Physical Bot. quantitative and qualitative research reviewed indicated that most subjects, predominantly White and Amencan, attribute the cause of their CF to a physical cause. Lane and CO-workers (199 1) compared 60 general medicine patients to a control group of 60 CFS patients with a chief wmp1aint of chnic fatigice using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule, version IiI-A. T'hey found that CFS patients were mort iikely th^ conmis to be diagnosed with 45 a somatization disorder and to attribute their illness to physical causes, such as viral and yeast infections, and hormonal imbalances. Al1 participants in this study were mainsiream Arnencans, and the causes they reported were consistent with those prevalent in North American mass media (Bouw, 1998; The Globe & Mail, 1998, Time Magazine, 1987). The extent to which the mass media shaped these patients' perceived causes were not assessed. Whether patients from ethnoculturai minority groups share these views has yet to be nsearched. In a postal questio~aire survey of 208 hospital out-patients with pst-viral fatigue syndrome, with a return rate of 84%. Ray and CO-worken (1992) examined the relationship between symptoms and patients' perceptions of theu illness. Participants in ihis survey were \"invited\" to describe their illness expenence. A majority of the subjects associated the onset of their illness with an Uifection or stress (84%). Only 3% perceived their illness to have a psychological cause, while 54% reported that the cause of their illness was physical. Patients with a high level of fatigue reported greater levels of disability and severity of symptoms. The researchers concluded that primarily fatigue, and to a lesser extent somatic symptoms and cognitive dificulties, play an important role in detenn\u00eening the perceived severity of the illness. However, there were some limitations to the validity of this study. Participants had to be able to read and write English, and because it was a mail survey, participants were left to interpret the questions on their own or to solicit assistance fiom others beyond the investigators' control. Another mrvey of 243 American patients by the Dartmouth COOP Pmject (Nelson et al., 1987), a primary care research network, reported that 65% of those who reported fatigue as their chief cornplaint indiated a physical cause, 23% psychological and 12% a work-celated cause. Patients who did not present their fatigue as the chief cornplaint cited psychologid problems more frrquentiy as the cause of this symptom. When cornpanxi with an agelsex matched patient group, fatigue patients were more oAni found to bave multiple physicai wrnplaints, difficulties 46 in many areas of living and a higher health care utilization rate than their non-fatigue counterparts. A prospective study by members of the Dartmouth COOP Project (Kirk, Douglass, Nelson, JafEe, Lopez, Ohler, Blanchard, Chapman, McHugo, & Stone, 1990) also found that half of the 71 patients who completed their study, attributed their fatigue to a physical cause while the rest attnbuted it to psychological factors. Another questionnaire survey of 61 1 primary care patients (444 female, 167 male) found that the majority (over 50%) of the subjects considered physical il1 hedth to be the cause of their fatigue and that these subjects also had higher total fatigue scores than those who attributed family, social, or emotional difficulties or poor sleep to be the cause of their fatigue (David, Pelosi, MacDonald, Stephens, Ledge, Rathbone & Mann, 1990). Al1 studies reviewed above, except the one by Ray and CO-workers (1992), did not solicit participants' opinion as to the cause of their illness in their own words; thus, the qualitative nature of their perception was not unveiled. A qualitative study was conducted by Clements and CO-workers (1997) to investigate patients' beliefs about their CF. Patients were asked open-ended questions about the cause and course of the\u00f9 illness. Aimost al1 (64 out of 66) patients believed their illness was caused by physical factors, mainiy non-specific viral infections; 45% of them cited physical factors as the sole cause of their fatigue and the nmainder reported a combination of physical, social and lifestyle issues. Physicai and social stresses accounted for 36% of the combinations. Although citing stress as playing a mle in theu iliness, patients in this study beiieved that the cause of their iliness was not c'psycholog\u00eecai.\" The majonty of the patients (70%) cclaimed that they had identified the cause of their illness through theu illness experience and reading; oniy 300h cited information hm heaith care professionais. Reduction of activity was the coping strategy empioyed by most patients (76%). Clements and coileagws concluded that stress-induced illness 47 is commonly seen as blameless, whereas labelhg an ihess as psychogenic may raise doubts about both the reality of the illness and even the character of the sufferer [cited in Ware, 19921. Whether such values are universally embraced, however, is highly questionable, especially among patients fiorn cultutally diverse North America. Psyc hosocial In contrast to reports in which subjects attributed their CF to a predominant physical cause, in the following studies most subjects attributed their ilhess to a psychosocial cause. Patients with psychosocial attributions reported less fatigue than their \"physical cause\" counterparts. In a British community survey, 116 out of 15,283 geneial practice patients indicated that they were suffiering nom CF (Chalder, Power, & Wessely, 1996). niirty-eight patients attributed their fatigue to a physical cause of myalgic encephalomyelitis. These 38 patients were matched randomly to a group of 40 patients who attributed their fatigue to psychological factors and another group of 38 who attributed their fatigue to social factors. Their levels of fatigue, psychological distress, symptoms, style of attribution and levels of disability were compared. Those citing a social attribution (such as excessive work pressures) were less fatigued, experienced less symptoms and were less handicapped in regard to their work, home, social and private leisure activities than the other two groups, and appeared to be most protected fkom distressing symptorns. The researchers concluded that patients who attributed their fatigue to social reasons, such as \"excessive work pressures\" expected themselves to be fatigwd and claimed to know the cause of theu fatigue. Hence, these patients were less anxious and depressed than the psychologid cause group, and felt more accepted by othen. especially their physicians, than the physical cause group. Although psychosocial perceived caws wuld be considemi as the prllnary instigator of CF. Ware (1992, 1993) prirportcd that a \"biopsychosocial\" one kst capaucd the jmtients' chah 48 of thought in explaining their fatigue. Ware (1992; 1993) conducted a qualitative study of 50 patients (80% female, 92% White) who suffered from CFS in the United States. Negative life events, chronic life difficulties (e.g. illness in the fmily, marital problems), a family history of psychiatrie problem(s) and an abusive childhood were cited by subjects as events leading to the onset of their illness. Almost half of the subjects identified stress as the most probable cause of their fatigue. Stress (the feeling of being ovenvhelmed by cornrnitments, loss, loneliness and isolation or fears of displeasing othets) was blamed for igniting a chah reaction which led to a \"cause of their CF.\" This \"biopsychosociai\" perceived cause postulated that the immune system was weakened by stress, resulting in a viral infection which constituted the symptoms of CF. Fifty-four percent of the subjects reported a \"biopsychosocial\" cause of their CF, and only 26% attributed their illness to a physical cause of viral infection. The sample under investigation was English speaking, with a minimal amount of ethnic diversity. Nevenheless, Ware's (1992; 1993) research provides a useful cornparison to the present study as they elicited the subjective illness experience of their subjects. As immigrants, Chinese patients in the current study may be confionted by many social issues in their adjustment to the host country, as well as the stigma associated with srnering fiom a medically uaexplained illness. Based on the findings of this study, it may be asked whether patients who articulate their fatigue to social causes, wouid be protected hm distresshg symptoms? HelpSeeking Bebaviour Patients' perceived causes of their ihess been recognized as an important detefminaflt of thcir helpseeking behaviour (Cheung, F., Lee, & Chan, 1983; Kleinman, 1982). The existence of severai distinct thenapeutic systems is a cornmon fw of hdth me in developing countries. Traditional medicine is of'ten pcrceived as more, or at Ieast no les, effdve than Western 49 medicine (Christakis, Ware, & Kleinman, 1994; Lee, R., 1980). In most Asian countries, both traditional and Westem forms of health care systems are often available to those who seek help. Multiple usage of both systems is comrnon among Chinese patients depending on their perception of the nature of their illness (Ho, Lun, & Ng, 1984; Koo, 1987). It has been reported that 60% of a sample of Southeast Asian immigrants in the US used traditional health practices before tuming to Westem medicine when they were il1 (Buchwald, Panwala, & Hooton, 1992). However, despite the growing literature on folk practices cross-culturally, there is little published material on traditional healing in Canadian ethnic communities (Beiser, Gill, & Edwards, 1993). Ying (1990) explored the opinions of 40 US Chinese female immigrants on major depression. Subjects were non-patients and they were presented with a vignette of a clinical case which met the DSM-III diagnostic cnteria of major depression. These women were then asked questions which were adapted fiom Kleinman (1980), to elicit an explanatory mode1 of major depression. Results indicated that 57.5% conceptualized the problem in the vignette as psychologically based. A majority of them suggested the cause of the problem that the subject of the vignette was experiencing was due to their migration. Thirty-three percent (33%) suggested a physical cause to the problem. Those who provided a psychologicai cause, because of stigma associated with such an attribution, opted to tum to themselves, family or tnends rather than seek help from Westem medicine, while those who provided a physical conceptuaiization were more likely to seek Westem professionel medical attention. Although the subjects of this study were not actual patients and their actuai helpseeking behaviour might dBer fiom speculation based on a vignette, these findings may nevertheless reflect the general thinluig of the Chinese population. Anderson and CO-workers (1991, 1992) conducteci a comparative ethnograpbic study to investigate the expaie- of chronic illness of fht gencntion Chiacse unmigrant women in 50 Canada and their Euro-Canadiaa counterparts. Two to three in-depth interviews were conducted with 30 women, 15 Chinese and 15 Euro-Canadian. Major difficulties were identified in the Chinese immigrant group's help-seeking experience. Health professionals' disregard of the obstacles presented by the circumstances of the patients' everyday life, language barriers and lack of \u00fbained medical interpeters in most health care facilities were cited as major problems. Aiso exacerbating the immigrant women's difficulties in living with a chronic illness, was their migration experience. These included being without a familiar social support system, the cornfort and confidence of living in one's own culture and the ability to speak fkeely in their own language. This study illustrates the unique experience of Chinese immigrant women who are managing a chronic illness in an unfimiliar land with a vastly different social environment than their own, Lee, L. (1992) surveyed a comrnunity sample of 100 Australian Chinese to elicit their methods of illness prevention and treatment. Of the 42 subjects who retunied their survey (26 femaie, 16 male), 63% of female and 60% of male subjects indicated that they used Chinese traditionai medicine. Sixty-seven percent of al1 subjects used both Chinese and Western treatments. Since not al1 participants of this study were patients suffering fiom an iliness or CF, their responses may not represent what they would acnially do should they become patients. However, these subjects' plurialistic approach to help-seeking is consistent with other reports on Chinese helpseeking behaviour (Kleinman, 1980; Cheung, F., 1989). Another survey which compared Chinese immigrants' experience with priaiary health care and their health behaviour to their British counterparts was conducted by Watt and CO-workers (1993) in Engiand. Anonymous questionnaires were baad delivereci by the researchers and explaimd in the language of the respondents. Eighty Chinese immigrants (either hm China or Hong Kong) and 73 \"White\" respondents, al1 employed in the catering indusfiy participated* 51 Completed sunreys were returned in pre-paid envelopes. The most likely action when unwell was to consult a general practitioner, which was reported by 84% of the Chinese compared to 65% of the \"White\" respondents. The \"White\" respondents also sought help fkom other allied health workers such as pbamacists and nurses. Even when there were no traditional Chinese medicine practitioners available in the area they resided, two Chinese respondents indicated that they would seek help fiom aaditional Chinese rnedicine practitioners. Dificulty in being understood by their family doctor was reported by 71% of the Chinese cornpared to 33% by the \"Whites,\" and almost the same proportion (73% Chinese, 35% \"Whites\") reported that they were having dificulty in understanding what their doctor was telling them. More than half (57%) of the Chinese needed to use an interpreter to communicate with their caregiver. The researchers concluded that the language barrier denied the Chinese full benefit fiom the British hedth service which was only provided in English. The Chinese respondents' poor knowledge of the hinction and availability of other health cate workers and their cultural preference to consult doctors, because of their perceived higher status than other health care workers, rendered them sub- optimal heaith service use. Since 90% of the Chinese immigrants in England are in the cate~g industry, the researchers claim that results fkom this study have applications for health cate of Chinese in other parts of England. The homogeneous nature of the occupation of the Chinese immigrants in England limits this study's generalizability to their counterparts in other Western countries such as Canada, where Chinese immigrants are employed in al1 waks of life. Although indicated by the resemhers as important, Chinese cultural and health beliefs were not addressed in this saidy. To assess the hem practices and help-seeking behaviours of Chinese residing in the City of Toronto, Yuan and CO-worlas (1998) sweyed 720 (52.9% female and 47.1% male) members of the Chimse general pubk \u00fbniy 8% of the participants were Cenadian bom; most were bom in China (59%) reported that and migrated to during the year 52 Canada more than 20 years ago (83.6%). The majority (90%) prior to the survey they had used the seMces of a general practitioner of Western medicine, and 21.4% had seen a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner. For those participants who only spoke Chinese, 52.3% reported that the language barrier hindered them in accessing health care. This was the first health survey of this magnitude in the City of Toronto, although the researchers acknowledged that the exclusion of the mental hedth issue was one of the limitations of the survey. Other limitations of the study include that recrui\u00fbnent of subjects was restricted to the City of Toronto where most Chinese residents who came to Canada prior to 1980, established themselves. The ment wave of Chinese immigrants, who maialy reside in the Greater Toronto Ana, were not included proportionally. In sumrnary, research indicates that Chinese immigrants are receptive to Western medicine, but their success in help-seeking and receiving good quality of care is often hampered by the language barrier between them and their care providers. Psychosocial Impact of Migration and Minoiity Status Despite inevitable stresses, the migration process does not necessarily threaten the psychosocial well king of the migrants. It is when additionai risk factors combine with the stress of migration that the mental health of migrants becomes a concem (Canadian Task Force on Mental Health Issues Affecting Immigrants and Refugees, l988a). The intensity of the negative psychosocial impact on the migrants often depends on the amount of adjutment they must make to survive. The more alike the source and host communities are in culture, social structure, language, and racial composition, the less stressfiil it w\u00fcl be for the migrant to adapt (Verdonk, 1979). hter culturai dissim\u00fcarity between culture of ongin and culture of destinaton is a pathogenic factor that thteatens migrants' mental health (Westermeyer, 1989). Minority statu 53 refers to \"social position that is less than that ascribed io members of another group\" (Kavanagh & Kemedy, 1992, p. 16). Respect is usually withheld from this group as a result of limited status, power, ador weaith. Although the Ontario Human Rights' Code (1993), prohibits any discrimination on the grounds of race or ethnic origin, there is no shortage of reports of racism against ethnic minority (The Toronto Star, 1999). For those immigrants who enjoyed being part of the majority in their home country, being reduced to a minority status and subjected to racism may render them feeling disoriented and resentful. Chinese immigrants who participated in this study were confronted with the stress associated with their migration to a culture vastly different than their own, being reduced to a minority status as weil as having to cope with an illdefined illness of CF and weakness. The combination of these two factors renders their mental health at An extensive literature review on migrant mental health conducted by the Canadian Task Force on Mental Health Issues Affecting Immigrants and Refugees (1988b) reported that unemployment and underemployrnent affect the mental health of male irnmigraats more severely than their female countezparts. English proficiency is positively associated with personal well- being, while education is negatively associated with adjustment. Perceived racism and lack of acceptance by the larger society had negative effects on the migrants' ability to adapt. Although the presence of extended family enables the migrant to cope better with the stress associated with daily living, it also leaves one more prone to familial and inteigenerational conflicts. Overly optimistic expectations of the\u00f9 f\u00f9tute aiso raise ~cuities for the migrants in adapting to life in their new homeland. Residence in an \"ethnic enclave,\" which allows migrants to have a sense of belonging and support, was found to enhance their mental bealth. The Task Force concluded that migrants whose stanis remaias constant d wbose familial, commuaal d societal support are intact in the host country, are at much lowet mental health ri& \u00eehan tho~ migrants who lack 54 these elements. This review provided a comprehensive overview of issues related to pst- migration mental health of migrants. However, the findings are dated, as such a comprehensive review has not been repeated for over a decade. In order to understand the cul tue-speci fic emplo y ment and socio-emotional needs of Chinese male immigrants, Wong, S. (1997) surveyed a convenience sarnple of 547 Chinese male immigrants between the ages of 25 to 50 in \"local rnalls\" known to have a large Chinese clientele in the Greater Toronto Area. Compared to the national unemployrnent rate of 9%, 26.9% of those interviewed were unemployed. They cited systematic bacriers such as their overseas credentials not king recognized, the requirement of Canadian working experience, and their lack of English proficiency as major hindrances to obtaining gaifi employment. Those who were employed indicated that they were not able to make use of their education and skills, because their overseas credentids and work experiences were not recognized, and because of their difficulties with the English language. Those who managed to get their credentiai recognized reported obstacles in acquiring the needed Canadian experience, to land any kind of professional job. Most of them were underemploye\u00fb and in unskilied laborious jobs. \"Work\" and b'fiaancia\u00ee\" problems were cited as major sources of stresses in their lives. The instrument of this survey was not validated, the methodology far from rigorous, and the location of the survey (popular Chinese mails cater to Chinese shoppers fiom the same neighbowhood) was hardly conducive to the generation of confidentid and private data, such as one's financial and emotional status. However, this survey provided a bird's eye view of some of the hardships encountered by Chinese male immigrants. A study of two generations of Chinese immigrants in Britain (first generation who were non- British born n=43, second generation who were British bom n=27) found that there was a signifiaint wmla\u00eeion between proficiency in English and psychologid symptoms (H.29, p4l.01). and depression (14.23, pdI.05) among these subjects. Pronciency in Engiish was 55 significantly correlated with occupational prestige (r=0.46, p<0.001) with the less proficient individuals more likely to be ernployed in the Chinese cate~g occupations, unemployed or housewives (Fumham & Li, 1993). These fmdings suggest that subjects who were immigrants were socially and psychologically disadvantaged because of their language proficiency. Since participants in the present study were al1 ht generation immigrants to Canada, Furnham and Li's (1993) finding serves as a reference. Sham and Jackson (1994) reported that the British national unemployment rate was 24% for Asian immigrants and 8.5% for Whites. In order to explore the impact of unemployment on the psychological well-being of British Asians, these researchers compared 71 unemployed and 68 ernployed, semi-skilled or unskilled South Asian men who were between 18 and 55 years of age. Subjects' psychological well-king was assessed using the Cimeral Health Questionnaire, Zung Anxiety and Depression Scales, Employment Commitment Scale, Locus of Control and Self- esteem Scales. The unemployed group was found to have lower levels of psychological well- being and self-esteem than those employed. Length of unemployment was inversely proportional to psychological well-being, suggesting that the longer one was unempioyed the worse the psychological well-king. Since this study did not assess the pre-migration employment or educational -tus of the subjects, the impact of migration on their employment status cannot be determined. Furthemore, neither of the \"standardized psychological questionnaires\" used in this study were tested for validity or celiability in the South Asian population, nor was the generalizability of the findhgs fiorn this stu\u00e0y to other ethnoculhiral group established. Ethnic cornmunities usually are able to provide emotional support by reinforcing their immigrant members' sense of identity and self-worth, and providing opportunity for fnendship. However, Lock (1990) ais0 cautions that ethnic communities are not \"naturai\" un\u00efts, that migrants can be subjected to exploitation, especUy as a work force by their \"own W. Summay The literature reviewed suggests that patients' symptoms are often presented in the manner most acceptable within the confines of their culture and, that perceived causes of illness are culturally and socially determined. Although some research has indicated that CF patients tend to have perceived the cause of their illness to be physically based, other studies present different and even contrasting findings. With the priority of social harmony in the Chinese culture, stigma, which also extends to the family, is a major concem affecthg dl facets of a patient's illness experience. Like patients with epilepsy h China (Kleuiman et ai., 1995), Chinese immigrants who saet fiom an iliness which is poorly understood, are prone to be stigmatized in their own ethnic community. Studies of help-seeking behaviour of Chinese immigrants indicate that they tend to use traditional Chinese medicine or both traditional Chinese and Western medicine concurrently to deal with their illness. They tend to be more receptive to Western medicine if they perceive their iliness to be physically based. However, lack of proficiency in English and feeling not understood by health care workers create significant difficulties for Chinese immigrants seeking help. The process of migration entails a seme of loss and the wed to adapt to the new country. Factors such as the dispanty between the home and host countries in culture, language, and social systems, and the drop in social and economic status put the migrant at a psychosocial disadvantage in adjusting to a new Me. The studies discussed above clarify some of the issues related to CF and weakness, as well as the illness experience of the Chinese immigrent population. However, none of the studies adequately addresses the cultural component of CF or investigates the ihess experience of Chuiese immigrants with CF and weakness. Good (1994) The literature on ibess representations is volumlliou - in history, literary studies, the social sciences, and the medical humanities, whether analyzed as beliefs or cultural models or illness narratives or mystified social relations. But detailed, ethnographie accounts of illness experience, or a well wrought theoretical vocabulary for the study of illness as human experience, are Iargely absent (p.117). In order to better understand and serve the increasingly strong presence of the Unmigrant patient population in the Canadian health care system, it is best to solicit the Mmigrant patients' point of view. Therefore, this study is aimed at the gap in the literature related to the iliness experience of Chinese immigrants who saer fiom CF and how they perceive and manage their illness. Chapter IV METHODOLOGY In this chapter, the methodology of this study is illustrated in five sections. The first section is an overview of the siudy design. In the second and third sections, the sample and site of the study are described. The data management plan is outlined in the fourth section. and the iast section addresses the protection of subjects' rights. Shidy Design The goal of qualitative research is to provide an account of a culture fiom the inside (Hammersley, 1992), and in the present context to gain access to the health beliefs and practices of a culture (Robertson & Boyle, 1984). Quantitative methodology was used to examine the occurrence, distribution and fiequency of data, and to explore relationships between variables (Leininger, 1985). The ties between quantitative and qualitative methods reflect a recognition that diseases are more than biological, and that subjective experience infiuences the outcornes of illness (Agar, 19%). Using both methodological approaches pursue simultaneously the goals of culturai vaiidity and research reliability (Lewis-Femandez d\u00e9 Kleinman, 1995). It also serves as a vehicle to cross-reference and validate both qualitative and quantitative data, and to unravel the complex relationship between meaning and action. \"Ethnographie research is ofien a necessary fitst step for generating culturally informed hypotheses that are appropriate for testing with the quantitative methods of anaiytic epidemiology\" (Weiss, 1988, p. 7). Ediaography, which is concemed with the context of discovery and interpretations of cuiturai phenornena, aims to pdu a detailed narrative account of what actually happens in a given social system or process (Atkuison & Hammersley, 1994; Robertson & Boyle, 1984). This is the qualitative method chosen to generate descriptive data and to elicit the meaning weakness. nirough 59 and context of the iliness experience of Chinese Unmigrants with CF and participants' direct accounts and narratives, ethnogtaphy ailows the researcher to understand the situation fiom the participants' perspective, to capture rich data, discover patterns, to see ways in which somatic symptoms fit culturai codes or idioms of distress, and how new meaning may be improviseci through metaphors grounded in bodily experience (Kleinman, 1 986; Leininger, 1 99 1 ). A non-experimental descriptive design was the quantitative method of choice for this study. Numeric summaries and descriptions of data, as well as the delineation of nlationships arnong variables were explored using statistical tools. These results were then used to elaboraie meaning of categories and associations, and determine the conpence of findings fiom the content andysis of qualitative data. Simple Family physicians practising in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) or those who are known to have a large Chinese patient population were contacteci to refer patients to this study. Prior to undertaking the cumnt study, the investigator had a. very close professional working relation with members of the Chinatown Physicians' Journal Club throughout her eight-year-tenure as the co-ordinator of a health se~ce catered to the Chinese Cornmunity. The availability of subjects and these physicians' willingness to cefer subjects were assesseci. Thirty physicians wrote support letters for this snidy, and the investigator was invited to present the study proposal to over 50 Club members at one of their regular meetings. After the presentation, the president of the Club took the iiberty to soiicit support hm other member physicians on the investigator's behalfciting the potential contribution of this stu\u00e2y in the understaoding of migrant heaith. Ali those attendecl the presentation agreed to refa subjccts shodd any of theu patients meet the 60 study criteria. As the pre-test indicated the need of expanding the recmitment of subjects to the GTA, the CO-operation of these physicians was sought. They recommended over 70 of their colleague, who were practising in the GTA, to the investigator to communicate for the purpose of the study. A total of 125 physicians were contacted and they al1 agreed to refer subjects; 45 actually referred, of whom one referred 3 and thm others each referred 2 subjects. Al1 except 3 (these 3 were Caucasians and fkiends of the Chinese-speaking physicians) cefemng physicians were fmt generation Chinese immigrants graduated fiom Canadian medical schools. Most Chinese patients in Toronto consuit family physicians when they encounter health problems (Yuan et ai., 1998). The ratiode for recruiting subjects in such a large geographic area was to include patients fiom al1 socio-economic classes and diveaity, such as clan, age, ocigin and time of immigration. A convenience sarnple of 50 subjects was drawn through referrais fiom farnily physicians. The subjects who met the following criteria, as detemined by theit family physicians, were selected for the sample: Inclusion Criteria 1. Criterion \"A\" of the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10) of netuasthenia: \"Either persistent and distressing complaints of hcreased fatigue &et mental effort, or persistent and distresshg complaints of bodily weakness and exhaustion afkr minimal effort\". 2. Above symptoms of prominent fatigue or weakness of at least 6 months' duration. 3. Adult men and women aged 1 8-65 with at least 6 years of education. 4. Self identification of Chinese ethnicity and have immigrated to Canada after age 5 from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnarn or Southeast Asia Exclusion Criteria 1. Any medical discase that accounts for their symptoms, basexi on piofessional judgement and f\u00efndings clinically appropriate by th& nfeiriag physicians. 2. History of schizophrenia, delusional disorders, bipolar disordea, or dementia. 3. Alcohol or other substance abuse or dependence. Site of Study The GTA was selected as the site of the shidy, as it contains the highest concentration of Chinese people outside of Asia. There are four Chinatoms or Chinese shopping centres in the GTA characterized by the many shops selling Chinese medicina1 material. In many of these shops there is a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. In addition, there are five major Chinese language newspapers, with an equal number of weekly joumals published in Toronto; nearly every one of them has Chinese medicinai advertisements and aiso special columns discussing the nature and use of Chinese medicine. The Canadian government, with a policy of multiculturalism, bas been receptive to the practice of traditional Chinese medicine; acupuncture is well accepted by and integrated into the major health care system. Chinese herbalists (usually called Chang-i or Chinese medicine doctors with the Chinese community) are free to advertise their services through the Chhese mass media. Like many of their counterparts al1 over the world, herbalists are not regulated and their training often varies hm years of formai training in an educationai institution to infocmal appcenticeships in Asia (Lee, R., 1980). Therefore, the standard of theu services vary; patients ofien rely on recommendations of family and friends who have sought help fiom Chinese herbalists when they decided to see one. This study was conducted in a hospital located at the heart of the oldest and largest Chinatown in kter Toronto. The hospital offers health educatiod programs in Chinese which attract large ambers of the Chinese general public hm the GTA. AU interviews took place in a private and quiet area at the hospital. Data Management Plan Data collection and analysis are not neutral activities, rather they are shaped by, and in tum, shape the theoretical fnunework of a study (Driscoll & McFarIand, 1989). The theoretical framework of this study was used to guide the data management plan of the study. Aarnodt (1982) purports that the ethnographer derives culhual data fiom abstractions of what people do and what people say they do. In this process the researcherlethnographer becomes an active participant in data collection and data analysis. Aaalysis of data is focused on generating categories and discove~g the relationships between these categories. These fiindamentai tenets of ethnography were employed throughout this study. Data Coilection Data collection involved in-depth face-to-face semi-structured interviews with participants, in an attempt to describe and understand the illness or topic of interest corn the participant's perspective. Upon the nferrai of the subject by hisher family physician, the investigator telephoned the potential subject to discuss and explain the goals and nature of the project. The subject was also encouraged to ask questions pertaining to the project. An appointment was then made to conduct the interview. The purpose of the interview was to achieve an understanding of how the participants perceive and interpret certain aspects of their \u00fcfe and the world around them; infonaants were probed beyond their initiai answers, and additionai questions were asked based on their mers (Herman & Bentley, 1992). Prior to the interview, the nature of the study was again explained to the participant and any concems helshe might have were discussed. The participant was aiso informed that helsbe was fke to stop the inte~ew at any the. Written consent was obtained pnor to the interview (Appendix B, p. 238). Instrumentation Data were collected using the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue (EMIC) - a semi- stmctured p.239). Despite its usehlness in providing a guide for research in the understanding and cornparhg of illness expenences, Kleinrnan's (1980) mode1 lacks operational precision which makes systematic comparisons difficult (Weiss, 1997). The Explanatory Model hte~ew Catalogue (EMIC) was developed based on the conceptualization of Kleinman's (1980) Explanatory Model of Illness to provide a method to assess and compare explanatory models, illness experience and outcome of treatment within and across groups. Recognizing that both qualitative and quantitative methods have limitations in exploring illness experiences and the impact of these experiences on patients' lives, the EMIC combines both approaches to facilitate an in-depth study of the indigenous concepts of illness and patterns of help-seeking (Weiss, Shanna, Gaur, Sharma, Desai, & ~ooqgaji, 1986; Weiss, 1997). nie EMIC provides clinical ethnographic insights and a means for comparing cross-cultural studies as well as studying intracultural diversity. It enables researchers to operationalize and compare explanatory models of local experience of ihesses (Choprapawon, Chuosutiwat, Kachondham, & Weiss, 1991). Responses generated from the EMIC produce a data set for both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the local expezience of iilness (Weiss, Desai, ladbav, Gupta, Channabasavanna, 1988). Guideci ethnogtsphic interviews of the EMIC produce a qualitative data set of rich desaiptive iaformation. S\u00fbuctwed sections of the interviews result in a quantitative data set tha\u00ee pmvides Monnation conceming the distribution 64 pattern of major variables. This combined data set can then be integrated to allow a systematic way to evaluate cultural models of illness, and analyze relationships between cultural context and outcornes of practical clinicai significance (Channabasavanna et al., 1993). This instnunent offea a framework for studying illness experience; different versions of the EMIC have been developed based on this framework (Weiss, 1997). The current version was developed by a tearn of international bilingual and bicultural experts specifically for Chinese patients who suffer fiom CF and weakness. It operationalizes Kleinman's (1980) Explanatory Model of Illness to allow a systematic elicitation of the following aspects of the Model: (1) demographic background, (2) patterns of distress (including stigma), (3) perceived causes, (4) help-seeking and treatment, (5) general illness beliefs, and (6) significant life events. These six aspects of Kleinman's Model (1980) form comsponding sections of the EMIC; each section covers a defined group of variables with quantifiable categoricaf ratings and is supplemented by extensive qualitative prose elaboration (Channabasavanna et al., 1993). \"Patterns of distress\" refer to the full range of problems resulting fiom the patient's condition. These problems include: experience of symptoms, social and economic difficulties, and stigma. In this section the persmal illness experience as perceived by the patient was assessed. Since stigma creates tremendous distress, and often impacts on patients' help-seeking behaviour in coping with chronic physical and mental illnesses, specific questions pertaining to stigrna have been included in the patterns of distress section of the EMIC (Weiss, 1997). These questions emphasise the social experience of iliness, thereby incorporating Goffinan's (1963) views on stigma (Raguram, Weiss, Channabasavanna, & Devins, 1996). \"Perceived causes,\" which may influence how a patient seeh help, refers to the patient's intqretation of the reasons and situations that have bought hisihet \u00eeilaess about. Help-seeking \u00fbehaviours are a\u00eei the forms of assistance the patient sought to alleviate the d\u00e9ring dting bm his/her iilness. These 65 hclude information that enables the patient to perfom selfsare, family, fnends and various kinds of health caregivers available to the patient. The section on \"general illness beliefs\" inquires into the patient's generaiized ideas about other illnesses, apart from the current problems that are af5ecting the patient, and their own and their families' opinions about the management of these ihesses. Epilepsy, depression and schizophrenia - illnesses that are stigmatized and poorly understood in Chinese culture - were chosen by a team of clinicians and nsearchers who are experts of the Chinese culture to be included in this section of the EMIC (Weiss, 1997). Data obtained in this section provide a back\u00e2rop against which explanatory models of CF can be interpreted. The section on \"significant life events\" elicits incidents tint have occurred pnor to and after the onset of the patient's illness. Data obtained fiom this section were incorporateci into the data set for analysis. The impact of these events was assessed. Narrative accounts from al1 sections of the EMIC were studied qualitatively to identify recurrent social and cultural themes concerning patterns of distress, stigma, perceived causes, help-seeking behaviours and their intemlationships. These intemlationships were Mer explored and substantiated through quantitative analysis. Pearson r was empl'oyed to examine the relationships among these variables. To allow grouping of similar themes into one variable, total stigma scores and summary scores of patterns of distress, perceived cause, and help-seeking behaviours, instead of individual scores, were wd for analysis. Structure of the EMIC The EMK begins with an empowering introduction, whereby intonnants are given the reassurance that what they have to say is Unportant and relevant. Short vignettes and metaphors are also used to help subjects understand the purpose of each section and reiaforce the leama mle of the interviewer. The foliowing is extracteci hm the introduction to the section on perceived causes: \"Each of us may explain something that happeas in various ways. For example. if their television suddenly went blank, some people might imxnediately think it was a picm tube or something inside their set. They might also consider whether the antennae had broken or whether the station stopped broadcasting. It might occur to them that they should have been maintaining or se~cing the set more regularly, or perhaps they just weren't meant to see the next program. Similady, people have different ideas about what hurts them or makes them sick. We would like to understand your own ideas about this problem, even if they are different from ideas of your fiiends, family or your doctors.\" Mer introducing each section with an effort to keep the informant at ease as much as possible in a hospital setting, each section of the EMIC begins the inquiry with an open-ended question which aixns to solicit a spontaneous response fiorn the informant. For example, in the section on perceived cause, an open-ended question: \"What do you think is the cause of this problem?\" would be asked to start the section. Screening queries are used to help infonnants to organize their thoughts and address particdar areas of interest. Prose elaboration is also utilized in these queries to help in understanding the relationships or associations, if any, among categones. Each section concludes with a summary query to help cl&& and validate the informant's ideas. Summary quenes, especidy in the section on perceived cause, can help the researcher to have a better understanding of how an Uiformant's explanatory mode1 may change over the. The semi-stnictured interview is structured to cover a full agenda, but enables a trained interviewer to proceed with patients with different response styles. Not al1 questions are necessarily asked of each informant. It may only take one question to stimulate substantive details of the informant's experience (Weiss, 1997). Ethnographie Intervku The posture of the ethnographie interview, which can best be described as conversations with a purpose, was employed thughout the EMIC. Agar and MacDoaald (1995) purport that 67 an ethnographie interview typically involves two people, the ignorant interviewer and the knowing interviewee. During the interview, the interviewer mostly listens and the interviewee mostly talks. However, the ethnographer does not start out intellectually \"empty-handed,\" but rather, the interview schedule should be based on the knowledge of cultural patterns and native language, so that the information obtained is relevant and is based on shared understandings between the interviewer and informant (Robertson & Boyle, 1984). The interviewer conveys to the interviewee that what helshe has to Say is important and the use of his/her every day or native language is imperative (Marshall & Rossman, 1989; Schatnan & Strauss, 1973; Spradley, 1979; Wilson, 1989). The investigator conducted dl interviews of this study in a language of the subject's choice: Cantonese, Mandarin (the two most widely spoken dialects of the Chinese language) or English. Establishing rapport is very important in a lengthy interview such as the one that was required by this study. Rapport implies a harmonious, trusting, positive relationship, but does not require friendship or intimacy (Spradley, 1979). The researcher made a continuous effort to deveiop and maintain rapport with the respondents. The researcher began the rapport building process by first engaging the respondent in casual conversation at the beginning of the interview, then telling the respondent the researcher's role in the process and that the conversation between the respondent and the researcher would be kept in strict confidence. The cespondent was assured that should a break or termination fiom the interview be required, hidher wish would be respected. The investigator's background, appearance, experience and manaer may affect the responses of the infocmants and the investigator's interpretation of the data. This investigator is a female health care worker who was bom in China in the early 1%09s, at the age of 7, she escs~ped to Hong Kong with her gmdmother as a cefbg to be reunited with her parents. ARct wmpleting 68 her secondary education ui an American missionary school in colonial Hong Kong, she migrated to Canada where she obtained her post-secondary education and subsequently worked in large teachlng hospitais in Toronto. For the first ten years in Canada, with al1 her family memben living in Hong Kong, the investigator shared accommodations and socialized with mainly Canadians fiom the larger society. The investigator speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, and three other Chinese diaiects in addition to English. With this cultural background, the investigator is able to relate to the Chinese and the larger Canadian cultures at ease. However, due to her professional training in Western health care and this study was conducted in a hospital environment, the investigator was very conscious about her subjectivity and potential Euro-centric interpretation of the data. in order to affirm that the correct interpretations of the data were made, the investigator verified her understanding of their narratives with the infamants during and at the end of each section of the interview. Although the EMK guide was adhered to throughout the interview, since it was designed to be generative, a great deal of personal narrative came forward fiom respondents. These narratives enriched the data and led to a \"thick description,\" a thorough description of the context in which the inquiry was concerned (Crabtree, 1992). Interviews lasted fiom 45 minutes CO 4 hours and the average interview length was one and a haif hours. Over half of the interview were over 2 hours, and one (#28) took a total 4 hours broken into 3 different days. Another respondent (#38) retumed to the hospitai twice to complete her interview lasted a total of 3 hours. Al1 abjects required 15 to 30-minute breaks during the interview because of fatigue and concentration difficulties. Accompanied by the interviewer, they took short walks outside the interview area or had some juice or tea while resting in the inte~ew room. Despite the Uitensity of their fatigue, al1 were eager to sham their experience with the interviewer. They aii meaied that the interview pmvided them with the fht opportuaity to tell their \"sto~es'' to somwne (the interviewer) who 69 shown genuine interest in what they had endmd since the onset of theu illness. Furthemore, the repeated reassurance of confidentiality allowed the respondents to express themselves cornfortably . Al1 interviews were recorded with the subject's permission, and those transcripts in Chinese (al1 except 3) were translated into English for data entry and aoalysis. The investigator translated al 1 \u00fbanscri pts re ferencing the glossaries of translated Chinese term into English b y Kleinman (1980) and Lin, K. M. (1981) to maintain consistence and accuracy of the translation. For ternis that were expressed in Cantonese and not included in the above glossaries, the investigator would translate the terms in the language of the participants who used the tenns. For example, Mo Ching Shen is the Cantonese expression of Yack of vitality\". Validity and Reliabiiity Validity For the quantitative camponent of this study, validity refers to the degree to which a measurement represents the actuai phenomenon king measured (Hammersley, 1987). To ensure validity, an adaptation of the EMIC especiaily suited to the study of Chinese patients with CF and weakness, was used for this study. It was developed, translated and back-translated by a team of bi-culniral researchea fiom China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, US and Canada at two separate collaboraton' meetings in 1992 and 1993 to ensure accuracy (Brislin, 1970). The questions and coding options of this version of the EMIC bad also ben tested and validated by pilot tests done in Hong Kong, China, Taiwan and Los Angeles. Content validity bad also been established by a panel of resemhers hm China, Hong Kong and Taiwan (Weiss, personal communication, 1995). 70 Validity in qualitative research is \"the gaining of knowledge and understanding of the tme nature, essence, meanings, attributes, and characteristics of a particulai phenornenon\" (Leininger, L985, p. 68). Although the researcher is very much a part of the instrument for qualitative research, which brings bias to data collection, Lincoln and Guba (1985) argue that human instrumentation can actually enhance validity through improved responsiveness, adaptability, holistic emphasis, knowledge, and, opportunities for clarification and exploration of atypical responses. Sharing of insights, consultation with memben of the thesis cornmittee, and reviewing the first 14 transcripts and their coding with Dr. M. Weiss provided additional checks on validity. The following qualitative validity bas been established for this study : 1. Descriptive validity, which is the accurate pnsentation of participants' narratives (Maxwell, 1992), was enhanced by the utilization of data fiom the following multiple sources: transcripts and observations fiom ethnographie interviews, quantitative findings and field notes. 2. Interpretive validity, which is \"a matter of inference fiom the words and actions of participants in the situations studied,\" was assureci by conductiag the interviews in the \"participants' own language,\" \"nly as much as possible on their own words and concepts,\" (Maxwell, 1992, p.289-290), and continuous verification of the investigator's understanding of the data with the participants throughout the interview. 3. Criterion-related validity is \"the establishment of the existence and nature of thc phenomenon with its meanings, attributes, and contextuai features\" (Leinioger, 1985, p.68). The delineation of the phenomenon: king an immigrant with CF and weakness involves the suffering of multiple symptoms, searching for meanings and amibutions of these symptoms and trying to survive contextual and social advdes in a new lad, reflected the establishment of t&is vaiidity. 71 4. Cons\u00fcuct validity which \"focuses on identify\u00f9ig and howing the nature, essence, and underlying attributes of the phenomenon under study\" (p.68) has also been attained as participants' shared similar distress and experiences with subjects in other CF and immigrant issue focused research (Leininger, 1985). 5. Concurrent validity refers to the congruency and syntacticai dationships of findings with respect to subjective, inferential, intuitive, objective (empirical), and other quality factors under consideration (Leininger. 1985). Detailed content analysis of participants' narratives and cross-reference to the quantitative data of this study demonstrated the attainrnent of this validi\u00eey . Reiiab\u00fcity Harnmersley (1987) defhed reliability as the ability of a study to generate consistent information of the same phenomenon given the same circumstances. The EMIC has ken used in many different cultural settings for assessing various medical and psychological disorden (Channabasavama et al. 1993; Weiss et al., 1988; Weiss et al., 1992; Weiss, 1997) and it has demonstrated good interrater reliability. Kappa statistics were perfomed on selected key items of the EMIC (Channabasavanna et al., 1993). For 19 items (included: most troubling symptoms, beiief in efficacy of doctors, self-esteem, body, mind and social effects, summary of these effects, body, miad, social, environmental and magico-religious sources of illness, sumrnary of these sources, most troubling perceived cause, perceived cause of madness, tirst help-seeking, acknowledging family help, satisfaction with this clinic and cnind/body relationship), Kappa scores ranged hm 0.32 to 0.91. Ody one seon was below 0.5, indicatiag interrater agreement was in the f& to excellent range of kappa values. The overall SUWIMEY Kappa for ali key items was 0.75 indicating excciient reliability ofthe EMIC (C-vanna et al., 1993). 72 To enhance reliability for this study, the investigator was given extensive training by Dr. M. Weiss in the proper administration of the EMIC dong with training on effective qualitative research skills and techniques. This training included: (1) one-to-one discussions with Dr. Weiss, (2) viewing of videotaped interview demonstrations by Dr. Weiss, (3) listening to audio taped interviews by researchers at another research site, (4) observing actual interviews by Dr. Weiss, (5) conducting interviews under the direct supervision of Dr. Weiss and comparing data ratings with Dr. Weiss, (6) reviewing of completed interviews fiom pretests of this study with Dr. Weiss, and (7) participating at a one week collaborators' working conference, with representatives fiom Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, India, Korea, Los Angeles, Boston and Toronto, to cornplete the development and validation of the EMIC for this study. Dr. Weiss also imparted extra training during the development of the specific EMIC's for three other sues at The Toronto Hospital. nie investigator's ability in obtaining valid data with the EMIC had been assessed and assured by Dr. Weiss (Weiss, personal communication, 1995). Reliability in qualitative study is the identification and documentation of recutrent, accurate, consistent or inconsistent features, as patterns, themes, values, and experiences in similar or different contexts. The phenomena under study consistently reveal meaninghil and accurate truths about particular phenomena (Leininger, 1985). Two types of reliability periaining to content analysis are pertinent to the cumnt study. They are stability and accuracy (Weber, 1990). Stability is the extent the results of content classification are consistent over tirne. Stability can be determined when the same content is coded more than once by the same coder. The same person (investigator) did d the coding of narratives referencing the EMIC codes and reviewing coding Weiss enhaacod stab\u00fcity ofthe findings. Aceuracy refm to the extent the classification of text of fjndings co~esponds to a stsadard. 73 The EMIC (Weiss, 1997) provided extensive pre-coded categones, thus decreased the amount of ke-fom coding needed and enhanced reliability . The reliability of the data was also enhanced by having verbatim accounts of what participants said, detailed field notes of their behaviour throughout the interview, having the same person (investigator) conducted al1 interviews and in the same location (Lecompte & Goetz, 1982). Field Notes Field notes enhance the contextualization of data obtained and the data analysis process (Fischer, 1994), and improved the validity and reliability of this study. Field notes were taken during and a\u00eeter each interview. They documented non-verbal observations such as the tone of voice, gesnire, posture and facial expressions of the respondent, and, the investigator's thoughts and problems. Four types of notes were written including: observational notes, theoretical notes, methodological notes, and personal notes (Schatzman & Strauss, 1973). Observational notes consisted of ail events experienced through watching and inte~ewing, such as postures, behaviours, tone of voice and expressions (Schatzman & Strauss, 1973; Wilson, 1989). Theoretical notes were interpretations, inferences, and conjectures derived fiom the observational notes. Methodological notes consisted of instructions to oneself (the researcher), critiques of tactics and ideas about methodologicai approaches (Schatzman & Strauss, 1973). Personal notes were written to describe how the researcher's age, sex, culture, status, role and even appearance might be inauencing the data collection ad anaiysis. Feelings, both positive and negative, during the interview were ais0 reconied. Personai notes add notatons Miller, 1990; Spradley, 1979). These notes were Uiserted into the text of the transcriaed interviews and incorporateci into the 74 data to Som the interpretation of findings by providing a context to the verbal data obtained. For exarnple, observational notes would provide the information that the participant was crying when she was illustrating how difficult it was for her to care for her family when suffering fiom CF. Data Analysis Both qualitative and quantitative data were checked for completeness before entering into theu respective computer prograrns for analysis. NUD*IST, a fiee-form prosesriented database, was used to assist the analysis of qualitative data. Quantitative data were entered into a data en\u00fby program written in DataEase, a database management soAware program which incorporates appropriate range and logic checks to minimize data entry erroa. After quantitative data were entered, the sarne data were entered again and the \"double entry\" feature of DataEase was used to detect any discrepancies fiom the initial entry. Al1 errors were corrected, once any discrepancies were detected. These data were then imported into SPSS for MS Windows Release 6. 1. for statistical analysis. Qualitative Data Analysis Aaalysis of the ethnographie data involves exp\u00fccit interpretation of the meanings and functioas of human actions in verbal descriptions and explanations; as well as rebuilding and presenting the processed data set in a thematic or conceptuaiiy relevant whole (Knafl& Webster, 1988). Quantitative and statisticai anaiysis usually play a subordinate de in this endeavour (Atlrllison & Hammersley, 1994). Data dysis began after the nrst intewiew and ran concunently with data wiicction. As soon as an interview was completed, qualitative data were traasiated, transcn'bed and dyzed immedhtely. This presc~ved the htegr\u00eety of the data which 75 might othewise be jeopardized by ciifficulty in wollection due to time lapse, and also identified emergiag ideas that could be checked or tested in other interviews (Marshall & Rossman, 1989; Miles & Huberman, 1984). Each section of the EMIC consists of several descriptive categories with predetermined codes for data dysis (Weiss, 1997). Ah data were inputted into the NUDWT program, they were coded using the descriptive categories and coding schemes of the EMIC. If specific data did not belong to any categories of the EMIC, ke-fom coding judgements were made, and new categories and codes were developed. Al1 qualitative data, including observational data obtained during each interview were analyzed using content and thematic anaiyses. Content Anaiysis Content analysis is the isolation, counting, and interpretation of themes, issues, and recurring features of the data (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994). The followhg steps, proposed by Singleton and colleagues (1993), were used as a guide for content analysis: (1) def~g a set of content categories, (2) sampling data described by the categories, (3) quantifying the categories by fkquency of occurrence, and (4) relating category fkequencies to one another or to other variables. Al1 qualitative data were dyzed, sentence by sentence, to facilitate proper content categorization. Ideas were reduced to numbers or an eaumeration of specific variables. Analysis summaries were written on each subcategory. These summaries were used to describe the content of each major category. Thematic analyW Themes are the manifest generalized statements by informants about beliefs, attitudes, values, or sentiments (Luborsky, 1994). The following steps proposed by LeUiUiger (1985), were employed in thematic dysis: (1) identifying patterns (or pieces of pat\u00eeem) hm idormants' narratives and researcher's ob~mations, (2) aggregating related hto meaningful units acco~ to similarities, (3) identifying mbthemes and their relationship 76 to the larger themes, (4) synthesizing of small themes into a comprehensive view of the data, and, (5) fonnulating theme statements to test or reaffirm phenornena. Themes were delineated within and across categones of data to facilitate the extraction of meanhg fiom the data set. The raw data of this study were analyzed; components or hagments of ideas and experiences were brought together to fom meaningful units or categories. Broad topics for the fmdings, such as perceived cause and help-seeking behaviour, were described in major categories; subcategories, such as physical cause and \u00fbaditional health practitioners, were developed to reflect narrower topical areas within the major categories. The coded data in these major and subcategories were reconstnicted into a thematic whole. Relevant quotations hom interviews were employed to illustrate the themes and the impact that Uiformants' illness had on their lives. Quantitative Data Analysis Descriptive statistics were performed for al1 quantitative data, such as for the demographic data, fiequency of a particular symptom, stigma, perceived cause and help-seeking behaviour categories. Nominal, ordinal and intervai data were aiso obtained f?om the demographic questions. Interval data were extracted fiom the patterns of distress, stigma, perceived cause and help-seeking behaviour sections of the EMIC. Responses to spontaneous, scnening and summary questions hm each section of the EMIC were tabdated. Based on related meanings, responses were collapsed into summary groupings. For instance, the category of psychological perceived cause was fod by collapshg perceived causes of mind-thoughts-worry (refers to concerns and experience of negative emotions), familiai upbringing (refers to how one was brought up) and pe~oaaiity attributes (&ers to nature of one's cbsractct) (Weiss, 1997). 77 The significance of each category was rated using a relative weighting system. Scores were assigned based on the importance of a particulai nsponse as perceived by the informant. For example, if the informant specified a particular cause of hidher problem as king the most important, a maximum score of 5 was assigned. If the idionnant responded without pmmpting to an initial openended question, a score of 4 was given. A score of 3 was given to a response that was obtahed through a specific question. \"Possible\" attributions or \"fust\" attributions to the informant's problem were assigned scores of 2 and 1 cespectively. Total values for each perceived cause cm range fiom O (if the cause were not mentioned at dl) to 10 [by adding the following values: mentioned initially (value of 4), most important (value of 5), and first (value of 1)] (Weiss, 1997). Details of computation of grouped patterns of distress scores are described in Appendix D @.DL), clustered perceived cause scores in Appendix E (p.295) ami prominence scores of help-seeking in Appendix F (p.299). A section of the EMIC explores issues related to stigma, including concems about disclosure of illness and social rejection of self and family, and the impact on self esteem (Raguram et al, 1996). In this study, these concems were assessed by asking 12 diffecent questions, and a sumrnary indicator of stigrna was calculateci based on responses to these questions. The response to each question was coded on a scale fiom O to 3, where a higher numeric value indicated greater stigma. Stigma scores that could range fiom O to 36, were obtained by adding responses fiom al1 12 questions. Reliability of this stigma sale was estabiished by assessing its intemai consistency using Cmnbach's alpha. Details of computation of these scores are described in Appendix G (p.304). Each of these categories cepresented vm*ables that were components of the iafoiniant's explanatory mo\u00e2el. AU categories were summerized and Mer dypd by using descriptive 78 between different variables. Differences between two independent groups were exarnined using t- test to examine relationships between nominal and interval data, such as gender, marital status, religion, place of emigration, place of birth, years of education, years of migration and major variables in the EMIC. Aaalysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to examine within group and between group differences for variables with interval data in the sections of (a) patterns of distress, (b) perceived causes and (c) help-seeking bchaviour. For significant ANOVA's, a post- hoc cornpaison test, Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference, was used to determine the source of the difference (Norman & Streiner, 1994). Levene's tests were perforxned to confirm homogeneity of variance (Norusis, 1993). The Pearson conelation was used to examine the nlationships among variables with interval data within and between sections. Due to the exploratory nature of this study, an alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine the statistical significance of the comlation coefficient obtained (Norman & Streiner, 1994). These results were then used to determine their congruence with the findings fiom the content analysis of qualitative data. Advantiges of In tegrrithg Quantitative and Qualitative Methods Integrating quantitative and qualitative methods in data analysis gives the researcher a much clearer picture of the data. Using both methods concumntly allows a two-way ceference of patterns of data obtained from each methd. Thus, quantitative &ta are enriched by qualitative data and vice versa. For example, sections of the interview that address particular components of the explanatory model (e.g., kidmy weakness as a cause of one's CF and weakness) or themes of social con- (e-g. engage in phys\u00eecal labour as a result of king a new immigrant contributes to one's CF and weskness) yield categorical ratings of quantifiable explanatory model variabies and 79 qualitative narratives suitable for thematic coding by topic. A tabdation of quantitative data, such as the percentage of subjects who refer kidwy weakness as a cause, may then be clarified with prose accounts that clan@ the meaning and experience behind the percentages reported in quantitative data. The perceived cause of kidney weakness will then be undentood fiom the patient's perspective (e.g., why he thinks it is a cause, how it works to affect his body and other aspects of life). Should the theme of 'overwork' be recurring in the qualitative data, the researcher can easily refer back to the quantitative data set to identify how many individuals cite overwork as a cause. Subcategories can also be created to delineate how many people attribute their ovenvork to 'not adjusting to physical labour as a new immigrant'. Furthemore, cross- tabulations of quantitative categoricd data cm also enable the researcher \"to identi& patients fiom celis with many responses, and for whom prose detail is likely to clarify the meauing of a strong association. On the other hand, exarnining the prose fiom a ce11 with a small number of responses may clari@ the nature of exceptions to the typical pattern, fiom which there may also be much to learn (Weiss, 1997). A pretest of the EMIC was conducted using a sample of ten subjects who met the sample selection criteria The pretea was used to determine the adequacy of the procedure for assessing the abjects and the clarity and ease of administration of the EMIC. The pretest provided an opportunity for detecting any gross inadequacies or unforeseen problems before the acnial data collection began. The length of time required to recniit the 10 subjects for the pretest helped conth the decision to extend the ncruitment of subjects to the Greater Toronto Area, and not res\u00fbict it to the City of Toronto, as large numbers of Chinese had moved to the suburbs of 80 Toronto. Physicians who had a large composition of Chinese immigrants in theu practice were recmited to refer their patients to the study. Despite their extreme fatigue, al1 10 subjects completed the interviews which took one and a half to three hours with one to three short breaks in between. Results of the interviews were anaiyzed. Al1 of the subjects found the questions comprehensible and appreciated the opporhinity to \"do a self-analysis of their illness.\" Since no major difficulties were encountered in the pretest, no alteration in the intewiew schedule or the EMIC was required. Findings fiom these 10 subjects were included in the fuial study sample of 50 subjects. Protection of Subject Rights Al1 subjects were assured of anonymity. Each subject was assigned a code number. Subjects' code numben and data were kept in a locked file accessed ody by the investigator for conf\u00efdentiality. To ensure as much privacy as possible for the subjects, the interviews took place in a room within the hospitai, away from the hospital's heavy tmffic areas. Only the investigator had the security code to access the data on computer. Only group statistics have kn reported and no individual subject has been identified fiom reported results. Permission to conduct this study was obtained fiom the Office of Research Administration at the University of Toronto. Risks and Benefits There was no known risk to participants. It was not anticipated that the information asked would jeopardue the etnotionai well king of the participants and they answered questions willingly. Where participants were experiencing extreme fatigue or discornfort, the inte~ew was paused to dow for a rest Participants wm encourageci to rathr tbaa the interviewer. The etbaogmpher is not an 81 interventionist; her role was to observe and record (Srivastava, 1991). There was no immediate benefit for the subjects other than having an oppoctunity to verbalize their feelings and illness experiences. All 10 subjects in the pretest stated that they enjoyed the opportunity to share their expenence with the researcher, as many of them felt that they had not been heard by others. The investigator anticipates that the knowledge gained will assist health care workers in providing culturally sensitive and appropriate care to Chinese patients suffering fiom CF. Summaty The methodology of this study has been outlined with ceference to the literature in order to accurately describe the study design, sample selection and data management plan. Data collection using the EMIC as an instrument has been explained in detail. Validity and reliability of the Uisaunent, as well as in qualitative research were addressed. Finally, strategies in protecting study participants' rights were proposed. Chapter V RESULTS The goal of this study is to provide a better understanding to health caregivea of the illness experience of Chinese immigrants who suffer fiom CF and weakness. The objectives of this study are (a) to elicit Chinese patients' patterns of distress, stigma, perceived cause(s) and help- seeking behaviour. This chapter is divided into five major sections. The fust section describes the characteristics of the participants. In the second section, descriptive qualitative and quantitative fmdings are presented with nference to the fm three objectives of this stu\u00e2y depicted in Chapter Ii (~1.30). Thematic categories delineated fiom the analysis of data related to the patterns of distress, stigma, perceived cause and help-seeking experience of participants, as well as the influence of Chinese cultural concepts and migration on their illness experience are described. The third section addresses the research questions which explore the relationships of individual variables as outlined in the fourth research objective (p.30). In the fourth section, participant's general iliness beliefs which provided a backdrop to their explanatory mode1 of illness are introduced. Finally, two brief case vignettes are presented in the last section of this chapter to illustrate the lived iliness experience of two participants. Characteristics of Simple All 50 participants, 28 (56%) women and 22 (44%) men, were fhst generation Chinese immigrants to Canada. Their mean age was 40.44 years (standard deviation 10.74, range 20 - 64); 80% were between 20 to 50 years ofage. Participants' mean age at immigration to Canada was 30.94 years (standard deviation 10.17, range 15 - 52), with 82% younger than age 40. The average number of years living in Canada was 9.5 years (standard deviation 6.3 1, range 1 - 23), with 64% less thaa 10 years. AU of them completed at least 6 years of education, 60% (30) achieved pst-secondary level and 6 had graduate depnes, mostiy hm their places of origin. Their average personal monthiy incorne was $875, with 18 (36%) of them claiming that they were either living on swings or were supported by thek families. Their average totai monthly household income was $2453, with 3 (6%) conveying that they had no income but had to rely on their savings. The majority (58%) was mamieci, while 24% were single, 12% separated or divorced, and 6% widowed. As for occupation, aimost half (46%) were unemployed, 16% were students @ost secondary or graduate), 14% were professionals or ownen of smdl businesses, and 6% were clerical workea or laborers respectively. Slightiy more than one-third (36%) of the participants had no religious affiliation. while 28% were Protestant, 22% worshipped Chinese gods and ancestors, 10% Buddhist, and 4% Catholic. Although half of the inte~ewees (50%) wen bom in China, Unmigrants nom Hong Kong comprised 54% of the total (some participants onginally fiom China immigrated to Hong Kong many years ago). The demographic data are indicated in Table 1.

They told stories of shattered drearns and ambition, loss of status and opportunities, and threats to family honour, al1 of which were part of the experience of suffering fiom CF. Although each patient unveiled a unique experience, the impact of migration was the ovemding theme in al1 interviews. Their narratives were grouped into the following major categor\u00eees: (1) patterns of distress, (2) stigma, (3) perceived cause, and (4) help-seeking behaviour. Many themes emerged fiom the participants' narratives of the\u00fb illness experience and their lives as immigrants. There was considerable overlap across these themes and ali the themes within a category are intercomected. Relevant quotations fiom face-to-face interviews are used to illustrate the themes and convey their coacrete significance for the lives of the participants. Descriptive statistics are employed to present the quantitative data, which help summarize the qualitative findings. Patterns of Distress AU 50 participants descnbed the omet of their distress as graduai. Fortyeight (96%) of them had considered their fatigue as a health pmblem for two years or less. They reported 4 to 12 symptoms with the majority (72%) suffering hm 6 to 8 symptoms. Fatigue was identified by 17 (34%) participants as the syrnptom that brought them to the awareness that they had a health problem, while 14 (28%) cited somatic symptoms and 12 (24%) sleep disturbances. Twenty- three (46%) perceived their problcms as very serious and 20 (4W) as moderately serious. Despite the overlapping and htetco~e~tdness of themes within the major category of patterns of distress, narratives in this category can mugbly be grouped into three sukategories of somatic, psychofogicai and social distress. Somatic distress, \u00fciw\u00fbakd in both physicai aad 8 6 traditional Chinese medicine terms, was reported by al1 the participants. Amongst the numerous symptoms of somatic distress reported, fatigue and weakness, as expected, were the most fiequently reported symptoms and had the greatest impact on participants' lives. Psychological distress was alleged to a lesser extent. Within the category of social distress, stigma and difficulties with social nlationships were explored. Stigrna was indicated to be their sole social distress. Social relations played a significant role in participants' perceived cause of their illness (see fmdings presented under heading of perceived cause), but were not considered a major distress to participants. Somatic Distress Analyses of open-ended questions on somatic distress revealed three generai symptom complexes that were patticularly salient for the participants: (1) fatigue andfor weakness, (2) sleep disturbances and somatic discomfort, such as pain, and gastrointestinai discomfort and (3) dininess. Participants' narratives moved fiom their description of somatic distress to difficult situations that confronted them on a daiiy basis, as immigrants. Fatigue and weakness made the participants feel helpless in fulNling their obligations to their families, and threatened their swival in what was a recession-battered Canadian economy. The following are descriptions of the salience and explanation of the three symptom complexes: (A) Fatigue and weakness are the most distresshg symptoms, (B) Sleep disturbance is both a distress and a source of fatigue, (C) Somatic disconifort is incorporated as part of one's life. A: Fatigue and weakness are the most diatmsing symptoms This theme emerges hm the @tathe \u00e2ata of A50 participants. There is a strong sense of Losing contml of one's body. A participant (#23) conveyed, \"tkre Lr this c011stantfceling cf 87 tiredness and even sleeping more doesn 't help. \" \"Fatigue, \" \"tiredness, \" \"exhaustion, \" \"lack of energy. \" \"no s\u00eerength, \" \"xu ruo \" (deficient and weak), and \"mo ching shen\" (no vitality) were terms used inter-changeably to describe their feelings of fatigue and weakness. The disabling nature of their fatigue, not only prevented them fiorn functioning at their normai level, but also transfonned the simplest daily activities hto difficult and even overwhelming tasks. Some had difficulties even in clirnbing stain in their own homes, while othea, such as a 56-year-old femde participant, who claimed not having sick leave during her 20-year ernployment at a bank, expressed that their fatigue and weakness had tumed normal simple tasks into insurmountable challenges. The following remarks were made by this employee: I cannot take if any more. It is not because I am facing a work problem (as a teller) or anything 1ike th, just ordinary work, right? I just fiel thar I camot stand it anymore. So ruo (weak). So ru0 (weak). (#37) ' Some participants illustnited the severity of their fatigue and weakness by comparing hem to a feeling of dying or king \"dead\", as they did not even want to move their limbs. Tired to the point thut I only lay down, but could not fail asleep. Tired to the point that I did not want to move my arms and legs. 11ay there as ifl were dead (#38) B: Sieep disturbance W both a distress and a source of fatigue Forty-three (86%) out of 50 participants indicated that they suffered fiom various degrees of sleep disturbances. Insomnia and subsequent difficulty waking up in the moming were reported by 28 (56%) participants. The majority of them were fceling extremely htrated and helpless as they \"tossed and med\" in bed for hours, feeling exhausted but not able to fa11 asleep. Some even said that they actually felt anxious as the night went by; worrying that it was going to be another long, long sleepless night. They blemed insoda for their fatigue the specinc participant- Fifteen (15) participants reported that sleepiness and the desire to sleep al1 the the affected their activities of daily living, especially work performance, and in some cases, sleepiness rnight even have endangered their lives. Some stated that they had a difficult tirne getting up in the moming. Even if they managed to leave their bed, they would have an urge to sleep throughout the day. Those who were still in the work force, felt so sleepy that they had no motivation to work. Most of hem spent al1 their spare time sleeping and this afFected theu self esteem and interpersonal relationships. For those who worked with machinery or had to drive on their jobs, their sleep disturbances subjected them to the risk of injury and life threatening situations. A 38- year-old male industrial engineer illustnited: I had 3 consecutive car accidents within o Cweek period. On one occasion, Ifell adeep when I was driving; if was in the afiernoon .... I used to have insomnia und hated to go to bed, but now I want to sleep .... I can sleep 16 to 17 hours ut a time. (#39) C: Somatic discomfort is incorporated as part of one's iife Almoa al1 the participants suffered fiom a certain amount of somatic discomfort. They revealed that they had learned to live with multiple somatic symptoms and accepted them as part of life. Forty-one (82%) of them SUnered fkom pain or headaches. Common symptoms included: Pain (27/50 or 54%), mainly joint and muscle (14150 28%); GI discornfort (10150 or 20%) varying hm dianhea, abdominal pain, stomachache, bloating, poor appetite and dry mouth; dizziness (960 or 18%); cold symptoms (4150 or 8%); sexuaI dysbction (360 or 6%). Most participants suffiered hm a combination of these symptoms which, they claimed, developed grriduaiiy after they Unmigrated to Canada. Many reported that these symptoms intensified with their fatigue. Some said that they felt as if they had never recovered hm a severe cold winter years ago, and that they were having a prolonged flu without the sneezing and coughing. The narrative below is repcesentative of the somatic distress dered by most \u00effeel very tired, and have joint pain and experience mo ching shen (lack cfvitali~. Every night I cannot fa11 asleep. (M7) Psyc hological Distress Functional impairment (especially social and personal functioning), depression and cognitive impairment were the most common forms of psychological distress the participants reported. Three interrelated themes in this category were identified: (A) Impainnent in social functioning and feeling depressed hinder Mfillment of family obligations and personal goals, (B) Cognitive impairment hampers self confidence, particularly with regard to social and occupational roles, (C) Living in a foreign land produces feelings of anxiety. A: Impainnent in social functioning and feeling depressed hinder fu\u00fciment of famiiy obligations and personal goals Twenty-nine (58%) participants reported symptoms of hinctional impaiments (social and personal f\u00f9nctioning), and 25 (50%) reported symptoms of deptession. These individuais stated that they suffered tremendous psychological distress, because they were losing interest in doing things they uscd to enjoy and avoiding social fiinctions. Consequently, they were unable to fulfill obligations to their elderly parents and/or young children. Those who were parents felt mistrated and ashamed as they were too listiess to play or spend tirne with their children. Those who were children felt very \"inadequate\" and guilty as they not only did not have the mina to pay respect or care for their elderly parents as dictated by the Chinese culture, but cather they required the assistance of the\u00fc parents to cope with their illness. The patients' sufEe~g was compounded by the\u00f9 loved ones who failed to understand or accept their ilhess. As this 34-year- old receptionist who lives with her parents illustrateci her feeling of furstration and helplessness when hei mother would talk to herseif but made sure wbatevet she said was within the patient's earshot : My mother would say (to herse& 1 have never seen anyone us lazy ar her (the patient)). Afer eating rice (dinner), she would go to sleep jus like a pig. It is ridiculoics, afler eating rice then to go to sleep, I have never seen anyone Iike her, then get up fo wash dishes, have a shower fhen back fo sleep again. Don't know what she is doing.\" She (mother) thinks thot I am ridiculous, but I do not want to be like tluir either. Honestly, I don 't want to.. . . I am nor happy with my mother's comment. I am honestly not lary. I am not a lazy person. (#KI) Some felt depressed and \"nan-Ruo \" (sad, miserable) because the goals they had set for thernselves probably couid never be achieved and their dreams of settling comfortably in a new land could never corne tme, theit hopes dashed and dreams broken. For instance, a 47-year-old mother, who escaped fiom maialand China to Hong Kong at the age of 13 and thought that she had fuially found a permanent home in Canada for herself and her family, alleged: Ifeef depressed I have studied English* a long time. In my mit4 I hope that I cun learn fluent English here (Canada) und cm speuk and understand others in English. Now it seenrs that I cannot achieve this. (#44) This participant felt that without the blessing of English proficiency, she could never fully participate in the Canadian society, or communicate with her two daughters who were \"losing their Chinese.\" She rernarked that ber fatigue had robbed her of her hop of a new life in Canada. B: Cognitive impairment hampeia self contidence, particularly with regard to social and occu~ational roles Cognitive impairment was reported by 19 (38%) participants. Inability to concentrate and pr memory were the symptoms of psychological distress that the participants had to contend with on a daily basis. Their self esteem was severely eroded; some even lost confidence in themselves. The\u00f9 activities of \u00e2aily living were affectecl; some had to give up dtivhg, because they were not able to concentrate when behind the wheel and on the mad Mers could not even prepare a med because they might forget to ami on the rice cooker or complete the mhg 91 process. Lack of concentration aiso made leaming difficult for the participants. Poor memory could dso be a fiightening experience, as illustrated by a 53-year-old sewing machine operator, who was dismissed \"due to fack of concentration und fafling asleep several times ut work \": Sometimes I forget how to write my address when others ask me to do so. I have poor memory. 1 keep forgetting when I try to do something. I have to devote tirne to reealling what I want to do al1 the time. I have to go back to the original spot to figure out whar I wanted to do. When I go out. I always forget to bring my keys. 1 have to go back to the house to get ail the things I forgot. ... Sumetimes. when l am walking on the slreet, I forgel which wuy I shouid go. (W7) Lack of concentration and poor memory created tremendous concem for the participants as many feared that even if their energy level improved and fatigue eliminated, they would not be able to hold on to a job with their cognitive impairment, and in tum, their ability to support themselves and the\u00f9 family. C: Living in a foreign land produces feelings of anxiety Anxiety symptoms were reported by 18 (36%) participants. They attnbuted their awiety to the decrease in their level of hctioning as a result of their illness and maladjustment to Canadian life. Many felt anxious as they envisioned their f\u00fbture. They dreaded possible permanent unemployrnent shouid their illness not improve. Unfamiliarity with the Canadian social protocol and lack of English proficiency also made these individuals feel anvious in their interaction with the larger society. Most participants sought help fiom Chinese-speaking sources if at al1 possible; many became anxious when they needed to communicate in the English language. Such as applying for sickness beneh or gohg to see a medicai specialist who is non Chinese-speaking. As revealed by a 40-year-old, male, factory worker who immigrated to Cana\u00e2a hm China 7 years ago: I became very amious. Even with little stress. My heart beats faster. For example, raiking wirh a stranger. seeking help Fom others in Canada. due to language barriers (Ifeel very anxious). V49) Social Distress - -- Stigma associated with fatigue is the main theme in the category of social distress. Thirty six (72%) participants claimed that stigma constituted part of their distress in coping with their illness. Participants did not considered dificulty with social relationships to be a social distress, but aileged social discord as a major cause of their problems. Specific questions pertaining to stigma have been included in the patterns of c\u00fcstress section of the EMIC to elicit patients' distress in coping with theu illness (Weiss, 1997). Findings on stigma will be presented under a subsequent heading entitied stigma. Numeric Summary of Patterns of Distress Table 2 below shows the mean scores of individual symptoms that condtuted the participants' patterns of distress. The possible range of scores of both the grouped and individual patterns of distress are from O to 5. The scores of the participants ranged from O to 5 indicating high level of distress to no distress. As illustrated in the qualitative findings, somatic distress, especiaily fatigue and weakness, played an important mle in the participants' dering. Table 2 f attems of Distress Individual Scores Fatigue Weakness Sleep Somatic Stigma Functional Impairment Hypochondriwis De pression Cognitive Impairment Anxiety Amotivation Lonely Social Relation Other Standard Deviation Maximum Minimum These individual symptoms were categorized into grouped patterns of distress scores. Figure 2 depicts the grouped patterns of distress mean scons. The participants saered fiom a combination of symptoms. Somatic distress was responsible for the major part of the participants' suffering, followed by psychological and social distress. Grolped Pattern d Distress Fatigue Funct Impair Stigma Other Weakness Depress Sxs Social Rel Grouped patterns of distress mean scores Most Troub\u00fcng Aspect of Problem The participants were asked to id&& the one most troubling aspect of their problems. Forty-two (84%) out of 50 who responded were able to pinpoint what troubled them the most: 32 (64%) cited somatic, 6 (12%) psychological and only 4 (8%) social (ail cited stigma). The remaining 8 (16%) claimed that a combination of somatic, psychological and social dimptions constituted the most troubhg aspects of their problems. Name of the Problem The following were names the participants gave to their problem of chronic fatigue and weakness. Only two participants calkd their problem Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and only one Yuppie Flu. These three patients explained that they found their symptoms to match what they lem about Chronic Fatigue Syndrome from the mass media. SU( declhed to give a Nune as they felt that only doctoa were quaiifmi to name an \u00fchess. Table 3 shows the names patients used to depict their problem.

These themes are: (A) Avoid disclosure if at al1 possible, (B) Others' knowledge of one's illness would affect one's chance of getting married or one's marr\u00efage. (C) Family preferred concealing patient's condition, (D) Feeling ashamed and Serior, and (E) Fear of negative effects on the family. A: Avoid disclosure if at al1 ~ossible Thirty-five (70%) informants indicated that they would avoid letting others know about their fatigue. Those who did not live with their families said they would keep it from them. Fourteen (14/35) participants felt that since there was no practical gain fiom telling others, \"other people could not help anyway,\" it wodd wt be necessary to disclose their fatigue. Another reason for keeping their condition secret was the feeling that other people would not understand their problems. Some (9/35) participants felt that even the\u00f9 family members and physicians did not understand their problems and thus it was futile to tell them. They also feared that if told, they would be labeled as ''1.y\" rather than having a health problem. A 24-year-old male university student hm Hong Kong explainad: Not just ordinary people, even doctors do not recognize it as rr problem. Ordinmy people would think I am Iosy and use this as an exme not to work ... I do not want to explain to thern since they will not understmd ... They will not look down on me but think that I am lazy instead ... Basically, how should I say if, she (mother) will hep othersfiom iknow\u00efng the bad things in the fmily. She dws not accept my problem as m illness. She does not (understond me). She would think tht I am Zay and use this (illness) as an excuse. (#18) 97 Fourteen (14135) participants repotted that there were certain people they would wish not to tell about their fatigue. They were afraid of adverse effects such as: (1) the tmth might jeopardize their jobs or might hinder them tiom landing a job, (2) other people might dislike those who had problems, (3) they would feel \"worthless\" if their conditions became known, and (4) the disclosure would make their family womed. These individuals also commented that it was \"a culniral thing\" not to tell others about one's failure or disgrace. They added that culturally, Chinese people did not wash their dirty linen in public. Such sentiment becarne more intense when they thought their illnesses might be iinked to mental illness. People to avoid fiom disctosure included CO-workers, employers and old fiiends. For instance, a 47-year-old housewi fe from Hong Kong, did not even want the nurse (who is Chinese) in her doctor's office to leam of her illness for fear of stigma associated with mental illness. She stated: Yes, of course. I do not want others to know about my problem. I seldom tell others of my problem. I recently told my husband about my problem. But he does not agree with me. I want to tell Dr. W. (about my conditions and ask him) to refer me to a psychiatrist. h@ husband thinks that I do not need to see one. This is a Chinese thing. For the Chinese, they think that it is not a good fhing to have mental illness. It is a taboo amongst the Chinese .... Most Chinese do not Iike others to know. It is not just me, but al1 Chinose. The Chinese are ajiad of mental disorders and think they (who sufer mental illness) are terrible. The person who goes to see a psychiatrist will be regarded as useless. (#44) B: Others' knowldge of one's illness would affbct one's chance of gettiag married or one's Thirty (60%) participants felt that their illness would jeopardize their chance of getting marr\u00eeed if they were looking for a mate, and 26 (52%) said that their manied life wodd be affected. These individuais saw thexnselves as a burden to their spouses, and others, especially women, felt ashamed of not king able to assume their responsibilities in meeting the day to day needs of their families. Some participants (1 1/30) considemi themselves suffig hm poor health and specuiated t&at their chance of finding a mate was diminished, because in pend, 98 people prefer to marry someone healthy. The follow\u00f9ig quote by a 41-year-old woman captured this sentiment: Fpeople know, it wifl affect ny chance of marriage. The potentiul partner would probabfy mind it is not a matter of discrimination. It is reality. Everybody is very reolistic these days. Exchange places, it does not matter ifit is man or woman. Ifyou are looking for a partner and the partner is like titis, you wouldprobably think rwice. (#48) C: Famiiy preferred concealhg patient's condition More than half of the participants (26) remarked that their farnilies felt strongly that their problem should be kept inside the family, in some cases even more so than the patients. They felt that it was a culturai (Chinese) thing that people wanted to keep things to the family. Lack of a concrete physiological explanation of patients' chronic fatigue, fear of king Iinked to a mentally il1 person and a common Chinese belief, mentioned by some participants: \"Famil'y shame should not spread outside\" might have hindered family memben fiom disclosing patients' illnesses. A 42-year-old man fiom China explained: I do not mind others howing about my problem, but my wije does not want other people to how. I may meet someone who hm the same condirion and he may be cured by tuking some medication or being treated by a guod doctor. I do not mind telling people. M) w@% thinks diferently. She thinks this is not something you shouldf\u00e9el proud oji.. She thinkir that others may think less of me ifthey kmw my problem. (#22) D: Feeling whamed and inferior Suffering hm fatigue had a major impact on some participants' self esteem. Fourteen felt asharned, 13 thought less of themselves and 7 also felt looked down on by oh. They were no longer able to do things that they used to do, \"achieve wht others can\" or fulfill family obligations. Feelings of king 'bweless,\" \"a failwe,\" and Yosing face \" intensified their suffering. Twelve (equai numbers of male and femaie) participants reportai that due to la& of understanding of theu ilinesses9 they hsd been mistakenly considaad by others (especially CO- workers) as king lay and as a result, they had lost face. Thoughts of king looked down upon by others rendered in the informants feelings of shame and resentment. The subjects also noticed that others had avoided them since they had the illness. A 40-year-old man fiom Hong Kong resented this avoidance, particularly nom his cousin whom he had helped prior to his illness: Yes, rny cousin used tu be quite close to me and I helped him tofhd a job when he first came to Canada. But as suon as he hadfound out about my problems, he pied to avoid me. He (cousin) would not even corne to our house fior a visit. (#8) E: Negative eflects on the family Twelve participants (24%) said that others knowing their illness would create problem for theu families. Ten (20%) were concerned that their families would be despised by others or theu family members' chances of rnarriage would be jeopardized as a result of their illness. A 52- year-old man fiom China felt that his daughter would pmbably marry a Chinese-Canadian who might be more acculturated into the Canadian culture than an immigrant fiom China, because more Westernized Chinese-Canadians might be more accepting of his condition: It may Mect my daughter a little bit. I think she will marry a Chinese-Canadian one dny, because when someone sees that herjbther is worhg as a manuui labourer, with illness of fatigue arusduw social siaius? you know. rhey muy Iwk down on her. (#20) Stigma Scores The possible individual stigrna scores range f?om O indicating no stigma to 3 indicating highest stigma in each category. The total stigma score is computed by adding the individuai scores for a total of 12 categories; the range of the total stigma score is O to 36. Table 4 and Figure 2 below show the individual stigma scores and total stigma score nom the quantitative data on stigma These scores srmimarize the personai experience of stigma iliustrated by the qualitative data presented. Table 4 Individual Stigma Scores Avoid Disclosure Problem to get Mamed Problem in Ongoing Mamage Famiiy Concern about Disclosure Self Esteem Sbame Others Think Less Others Avoid You Problems for Family Others Refuse to Visit Others Think Lem of Family Problem for Relative to Mary Standard Dev - Min 1.32 O 1.26 O 1.26 O 1.38 O 1.34 0 1.37 O 1 .17 O 1.20 O 1.31 O 1.12 O 1 .O3 O 0.99 O Max - 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 The criterion for judging the acceptability of a scaie's internai consistency is a Cronbach coefficient alpha of 0.70 (Frank-Stromborg, 1992). The stigma sale demonstrated good interna1 consistency with a Cronbach coefficient alpha of 0.8 14. The mean total stigma score is 14.52, with a standard deviation of 8.44, sum of 726, minimum score of O and maximum score of 35. Indicating that rnost subjects were sunering fiom a moderate level of stigma. Figure 2 shows the distribution of total stigrna scores of al1 the participants. Most feel they experience a fair amount of stigma as a result of their illness. With the highest score being 36, one participant (a 45-yew old unemployed machine operator, who was a teacher in China) has a scon of 35 indicathg a high level of puceived stigma suffieteci by the individual. Figure 2. Distribution of Total Stigma Scores Coping Strategies to Minimize Stigma Coping strategies to miaimize the impact of stigma experienced were formulated by the participants. These were mainly selfdirected. Strategies included: avoiding people and keeping to themselves, attributing their misfortune to fate, and nomalization. Most in\u00eeonnants seemcd to think that nomalization was the only strategy that would help them to keep their jobs in today's grim empioyment reality. A 46-year-old man hm Hong Kong expressed: 1 don? wan\u00ee people tu hw. I want to pmtend especiallj at work that there is nothing wrong with me. but my look offitigue @es me away..... I have this illness I dont want to have it in the open to let al1 my CO-worbrs know. Thar is why men when I was really Mering at work to the point that I didn T wem want to movet I still Mt on worhng. (HS) Perceived Cause Participants were asked to speculate about the cause of theu illness. Culture and their migration experience were believed to have precipitated their illness in many cases, although most participants reported that in fact, there were multiple contributhg factors for their fatigue. This was illustrated by the following quote from a 38-yearsld university educated male industrial engineer of Hong Kong descent: There are ltlultiple factors put together. It may be relnred to faeD cause and effect. The came can be my part, my famiiy re&tionsh@, educational backgroundD lifsryleD personality. and why my brother's wife liked Toronto su much that ny family moved here. Al1 and all, \"I woui\u00f9 not be like this. if1 was not stuc& in Toronto. \" (#39) Eight interrelateci themes can be identifieci from the participants' narratives as causes of thek perceive\u00e2 problem. Aithough the participants were never duectly asked about the impact of migration on their i\u00eelness, some of them gave accounts of theu iliness experience king shaped by their experiences as immigrants in a foreign land. The impact of migration was reported as one of the major causes of their illness. Many were grieving for their losses - quite a few could not find similar jobs in Canada, while a good number regretteci having sold their properties in Hong Kong since the value of pmperty there had incredibly increased 200% after their departure. Their fmcial difficulties in Canada resulted fiom downward social mobility, underemployment and unemployment, compounded with increased expenses stemmhg fiom the coa of treatments that are not covered by health insurance. A substantid number of the participants were unable to work and had to rely on savings they brought with them at the time of migration. Although they might still be able to put food on the table, they were womed when they thought of the\u00f9 grim futurr, and the slim chance for them to retum to theu old selves pnor a indicatcs patient's actual words in Engiish. to migration. The common theme of the impact of migration idtrated and influenced many of the other themes on the perceived cause. as illustrated below: (A) Social factors as the most significant perceived cause, (B) Overwork and adjustment to physically demaoding work exbaust one's body, (C) Psychological factors contribute to fatigue. (D) Medical and physical causes - leamhg the cause from the mass media, (E) Traditionallcultural explanations - one's body in disharmony, (F) Congenital or hereditary factors - getting the illness fkom birth, (O) Magical and supernatural forces that are beyond one's control, (JI) Being exposed to envuonmental pollution. A: Social factors as the most signifiant perceived cause Forty-seven participants (94%) attributed the cause of their fatigue to social issues. Coping with the challenges of an \"astronaut \" family , difficulties erromtered in interpersonal ancl familial relatioaships after migration, coming to terms with underemployment or unemployment, king victimized by racial discrimination especially at the workplace are the sub-themes of this theme. a: Coping wW the chailemes of an azistn,nautn fcunjy Participants cited coping in a new social milieu as an immigrant, especiaiiy withait the support of their spouse, as the major cause of their fatigue. Lack of employment opportunities due to Canadian economic downturn in recent years led to the creation of \"astronaut\" fpm\u00fciw, in whi\u00e7h OIW spouse (moBtly men) works in Asia to support his fimily in Canada and mes \u00f4ack and fordi to sec his famiiy a few tims a yeu; the othct spouse (&y women) 104 solely carry the burden of caring for young children and elderly parents or parents-in-law in their newly adopted home - Canada. As explained by a 41-year-old mother of two who previously worked as a secretary in Hong Kong, life as a \"single mother\" in a new land posed great challenges, requulng her to look after her children and manage the household al1 on her own without any support fiom her spouse. I think its (illness) omet has connection with the fact that my husban\u00e0 and I are living in 2 different colrntries (husband work in Hong Kong). Besides, my son's healrh problem aiso makes me very anxious. and other family members (mother- an\u00e2 brother-in-[mu) are not communicating with me. Moreover, I feel my life is very monotunous and boring. (#33) Other immigrants were left behiad in Canada to fulfill the immigration residency requirement, while their spouses retumed to their places of origin to continue to pursue thei. careers. These subjects okn found t\u00fbat such longdistance relationships created tremendous difficulties for theu marriage and negatively affecta their health. A 32-year-old secretary. who was previously employed as a marketing executive in Hong Kong, expressed: He (husbarui, an engineer) luis gone bock to Hong Kong (owing to lock of employment opportmity in CMadO) for a year and a hlf now. We are seporaed due to empluyment problems, but not because of incompatbilities. It is hard to say hm it wou\u00ee\u00fc tum out, because he is there and I M here. Xkre is uncertainry (&out our mumuge). Tlris b: encomterd in interpersonal and fsmilial reIationships after migration Interpersonai conflicts and tension developed amongst extended family members. In their home country, they udly did not live in the same household or have close contacts with each other. However, they hd to live under the sam roof in Canada for mutuai support, due to unfamiliarity with the ncw environment. The resdting tension was especially serious for patients hm Hong Kong and Guangzhou where spce is at a premium, and they were accustomeci to living in a nuciear My unit prior to migration. These participants tesented 105 having to share a house or an apartment with members of their extended farnilies &et comhg to Canada To the Chinese, the tem 'family' includes both members of their immediate and extended farnilies and such definition extends beyond the Western concept of a nuclear farnily unit. Participants felt obligated to Iive with members of their extended families because space was no longer in short supply. However, they found it extremely difficult to cope with conflicts arising fiom the day-to-day discord and lack of privacy. Subjects reported dificulty in expressing displeasure to senior family members since they feared this might be interpreted as a disrespectfbl gesture. A 36-year-old factory worker, who was on sick leave at the time of inte~ew, attributed her illness to family disharmony. She conveyed: Three years ago when nzy sister's fmiiy first came (to Cd) fro China, they lived with us. There were conflcts between my mother-in-iaw and my sister. I was very upset by the situation. but di&'? &re to say anything. I began to experience discornfort in my hem at th time. Mj husband told me it was because I kept everything to rnyself and tluu 1ed to my problem. I think he is right. The emotional upset during thoe 9 months pro- did something to me. (#5) Dinicukies in adjusring to Canadian life and changes in familial roles were reported as other causes of &ta1 problems, which in mm was perceived to have an impact on the participants' health and fatigue. The following quote is from a 38-year-old former fashion designer who was very fnistrated by her husband's inability to reestablish his gment manufacturing business in Canada. I've had lots of arguments with my hrcrband for these 3 years Mer we came to Cima&. We have lots of problemr. We men thought of getting a divorce .,... We paid a big price for inunigrmion. We had fewer probiems when we were in Hong Ko~g. In Canacia, Our mitrital rebtionship luis deteriorateci* (#38) job and wastage of their sk\u00fcls. A Wyear-old female jewelry salesclerk ftom Hong Kong, was very resenthil that she could w longer reswne her career as a successful jewelry merchandizer in Canada. She felt that her fatigue was caused by her change of lifestyle in Canada where her dreams were shattered and potential could not be developed. My irestyle wm forced to change after coining to Cana&. mis is not whot I hud in mind before I came here. IJind thor I have to make major changes to adjust, I con put up with the sewre climate, but absence of a challenging job is the most dincuit thing to adjut to. (#14) d: Behg victimized by raclai discrimination especinlly at the workplace Racism, especially discrimination in the workplace, was also perceived as a major contributing factor to their ilhess. A considerable number of participants felt that preferential treatment was given to their CO-workers who were fkom the major culture. They believed that they were often given the hardest tasks, and were targeted and even blamed for mistakes made by other workers. The\u00f9 inability to defend or express themselves fluently in English compounded thek problem and cornpelleci them to suffer in silence. They said that supervisors, who did not appreciate how dificult it is to lem a new language as an adult, often blamed them for what they thought was relucuure to lem English. Some participants Found it very fnistrating that they had tried th& kst to leam English after a day's hard work, but did not seem to be able to retain the English they learnt. A 42-year-old factory worker considered racism and interpersonal cod\u00eeicts as important causes for his fatigue. He said: There are racism and personal conficts in the factoty. I hovc wurked for 4 years in the facto ty.... I think it is more than overwork. I there, becaure the foreman aiways wms to find fault with me. II may be because my English is MO good enough. I don? btow what they think about nie.... I think tk poor English is a reuson for disctimrmrttat\u00eebn; peuple aIso aiieged: I am the factory since I do not speuk Engfish. Iney blame me for others' mistokes. I cannot defend myself because I do not speak English. I feel very miserable in CoMda because I cannot speak English. (#47) B: Overwork and adlus\u00e2nent to physicaliy demandin~ work exhaust one's body Fotty-two out of 50 (84%) participants felt that overwork was the cause of their fatigue. Lack of a support system in Canada, change fiom a sedentary position to a labour intensive job as a result of non-accreditation of their overseas credentials, limited English proficiency and hard work to support extended family members in the\u00f9 homeland were reported as causes for their fatigue. Many found the \"Canadian lifestyle\" of juggling a full tirne job, childcare and housework extremely demanding. This was especiaily so among fernale participants From Hong Kong who had maids do household chores prior to migration; some of them remarked ULat they did not even Lww where to begin. This problem became worse if they were members of an 'astronaut* family and had to perfonn \"a mm's work\" of shoveling the snow or mowing the lawn. As iilustrated by a 43-year-old mother of three young children: We have no relatives or fie& in Toronto. It is just the heu of us coping with al1 the chiMcare. Yes, dl the hrd work and lack of sleep over on mended pend Q finie have ahausted me and weakened my bu&. (#9) Others recounted a long history and cumulative efFect of ovemork on their bodies over the years. Their narratives refle\u00e7ted the politicpl Pnd social developmew of Cbina that greatly aff'ected or even uprooted their lives. Many felt that they were in an exodus al1 their lives - started by their parents - searching for the pmmiscd-lan\u00e2 where they couid hd political and sociai sec*. Trying to resettie in a new laad was a repeated experience for di the participants who were born in China, Iater emignied to Hong Kong and evemuPlly immigratesi to Canada. Perhps the oaly diffenoce this tirne was that they became the leaders of the second exodus. A 46-year-old male recalled: 1 think feeling tircd has a lot to do with me working night shiji since I came to Ca na&.... When we @utient and famiiy) went to Hong Kong @om Mainlan\u00e0 Chinu) in the 50's. Our living conditions were ve9 poor. Shek Kep Mei (a govemrnent housing project for refgees and new immigrants from China after the Conununists took over China in 1949) was a slum. My mother had to cany soi1 at comtruction sites for $2 smhing a dq. Afler that, she worked as a sewing machine operator, su even I hew how to operate a sewing machine. I had to work when I was 9 years old. She would rent a sewing machine home* she went ro work in the nzonUng and retunied home at 6 or 7 in the evening. We didn't hove electricity and on& used oil lumps, and we sewed with that light. Life was hard in Hong Kong at that tirne. My sister war about II to 12 years old Md she had to work as a child labourer on an arsembly fine in a factory. I sewed at home* the conrplicated items would be sewed by her (mother) and I would sew the simple ones. I would sew straight lines of a pocket, and I would do thut ar soon as I came home from school. ntcu might have some effects on my faigue now, because even at such a young age I had already ovenvorked. (V15) Many participants, especially those fiom China, felt that they had overworked themselves to meet expectations and demands fiom relatives. A lot of resentment was directed at the\u00f9 dernanding relatives who still held the belief that Canada was a \"gold mountain\" for anyone to dig, and that whomever had the opportunity to dig it was obligated to share the good fortune with their loved ones who were left behind in the home country. Despite feling treated unfairly, the participants did wt feel able to forsake this obligation, and they felt that they had to work bard to meet their relatives' demands. As tirne passed, they believed that the additional hard work took a toll and caused th& fatigue. A 50-year-old engineer fiom Shanghai voiced ber frustration: ney (brother an\u00e0 srrter-in-h) do not know how hard Iifc is in Cd. They think we have gone to the Gold Momain (&me Cltinese people cal1 North Americu by this name due to the gold wh ut the tum of the century), and that al1 we have to do is to pick up the gold wherever we go. In fua? we have tu wonk vety hrd. Ojh we work till mi'ight or 2 the morning. They won't un\u00e0erstd th. TIrcy Rrep \u00e0\u00e8manding things. Tky want this and th. mey want us to pay for long distance cd&. Endess FiHQIlyt I c~not take it anymore. mis the cuuse of niy problem. (r25) C: Psycho1olljcai factors contribute to fatirne A psychological cause was reported by 47 (94%) of the participants who stated that they were living with a tcemendous amount of stress. They stated that this stress was primarily \u20acmm uyiag to survive in a new land, having language problems and having lost the familiarity and security of living in their home country. Living with shattered dreams, some put enormous pressure on themselves to succeed in the new country. Tbeir self-esteem and confidence plummeted as they recailed theu \"glonous days\" prior to migration and now saw their former subordimites in their homeland take over their previous positions. The plunge in their financial and social stanis rendered them feeling helpless and hopeless, because they could not return to their place of origin, due to skyrocketing house prices or the inability to reclaim their previous jobs or seniority in employment. Moreover, they feand that going back wouid cause them to be lwked down on by others and to Iose the abiiity to acquire citizenship status in Canada. Many felt pilty and wonderd if they had made the right decision to corne to Canada. They considered stress and their inability to cope with it as the cause of their problem. A 28-year- oid mother of two daughters. aged 3 and 5, from China recounted a story of being abandoned by her abusive husband one and a half years pnor to the interview. 1 guess it is because of al1 the stress I have had mer since I came to Canado. I used IO lead a very shelfered and protected life when I was in China. I was single then. But mer since I was in CbllClCCa, I have had to face lots of misfortune in \u00fcfe by oyse~especi~Ily @er my separarion from my husband. (#3) Others regarded the\u00f9 personality as the contributing factor to their ilhess such as: having a negative outlook on life, wonying over trivial things, becoming anxious easiiy and possessing a rigid personaiity. A 40-year-old fatory worker Chh, dering from neurasthenia, explained: My personali\u00eey is that I & dot adj& eusi&, so the most important came is immigr~on to CoMda. A&o, there is pressure Pom leming Englistr. I cannot pick it (Eng\u00fcsh) up.... get nervous and leardng the cause hm the mass me\u00e0ia Perceived causes of a Western medical or physical nature were mentioned by 37 (74%) of the participants. It is surprising to note that their conception of Westem medicine was similar to that of their ancestors when Western medicine was fitst introduced to China more than a centwy ago. They felt that Westem medication was only effective in treating acute illnesses. but might have a negative effect on theit health in the long mn. Monnation from the mass media on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome also influenced their perception of the causes of the\u00fc illness. Some attributed their illness to acquiring the Epstein-Barr virus. This sentiment was expressed by a 56-year-old fernale bank telier and male owner of a fast food restaurant of the same age: Since I had an operation, hysterectoniy, I have not been sleeping well, maybe thot resulted in my fatigue sewral years later. (#37) I think niy cold causes the detetioration of my body. It is cwsed by the virus. (#43) E: Traditional and cultural explanations - one's body in disharmony Forty-five participants (90%), described the cause of their illmss in traditional Chinese medical terms. They clairned that they formu\u00eeate\u00e2 this cause by monitoring their own body sensations and associating these sensations with whnt they had learnt about traditional Chinese medicine when they were growhg up. They also consulteci family aad ftiends, and obtained a diagnosis of thek current illness by practitiows of traditional Cbse medicine. Cultural health beiiefs were reflected in the participants' use of terminology and in the perceived causes of their illness. The followirig were commoa traditional Chinme medicine tem which the participants used to describe the causes of their illatss: \"M-kou kt\" (not enough \" (kidney wealaiess), \"shen kuei \" mdoey deficieacy), \" Ching Lock (channels and collaterals) imba\u00ee\u00e0nce \". \"lack of qi, i, \" \"Yin Yang imbalonce. \" \"Mo Ching Shen\" (no vitality). Many blamed themselves for not observing rituals outlined by traditional Chinese medicine in maintaining good health, such as a 44-year-old woman with four ch\u00fcdren ranging from age 8 to 16, who expressed: I did not take precautions afler my pregnancies. For example, I came in contact with water a lot and I didn 't rest as I should have. I had ro do all the hoousework within a month Mer f gave binh, there was no one to help me. I'm sure if I did al1 the nghr things thaf mortth. I would k a lot healthier. Such as avoided water, heavy lifling and work. avoided cold foods. (#1) Several interviewas, especially those who called their problern neurasthenia, attributed their problem to shen xu or kidney weabiess which is a sign of aghg or deterioration of one's body due to overwork or lack of nutrients. Others used shen &uei' or kidney deficiency, which is nlated to excessive sema1 activity to accouat for their problem. A 32-year-old male whose wife was living in China at the thne of the interview illustratecl: \"M-hu huet\" (not enough blood) in nzy heart is probably the major cause (of my prubfem). Neurasthenia is certainly re\u00f9ued tu shen xu (kidney weakness). According to the principles of Chinese medicine. kidney is the source of Ching lick (vital energy). If a person is energetk for sure, the person's kidneys are strong. Aisu, when people ore apprwching their thinies or forties, when they start to grm old, thejirst organ to become weak is the kidnq. (n4) F: Congenitai or heredItPry factor - getting the Ulness from birtb Wf of the participants (25) felt that they were prone to fatigue and weakness because they were bom weak or not as saoag as others. They attributcd their illness to lack of nutrition as a chiid or before they were born, whik others thought that since members of their immediate family, such as mother or sister, suf\u00efered hm neurasthenia or kidney problem, they must have inherited it. Some felt frustrated rather than reiieved when they were told by Western mdicine practitiomxs that theh kidneys were healtby. Such worry and confusion 112 were indicated in the account of a 28-year-old, cornputer science graduate from a Canadian university : I suspect th? my waist @inring to lower bmk) problem is due to my kidneys. A long time ago, when I was still in my home town, someone told me, in a long distance call, that my sister hud kidney disease. I think if the diseare is hereditary. I may afro suffer from if. (#42) G: Magicai or supematwal forces that are beyond one's control A cause that was related to interpersonal difficulty was found amongst more than half of the participants (29 or 58%) with references to sorcery, bewitchment and spirit attack. Sorne interviewees held the belief that one could fa11 il1 merely by the envy, hatred and ill-will of another person who wanted one to die, suffer or fail. Others attributed causation of their illness to ancestral or their own wrongdoing in past or present lives. Moreover, some participants felt that supernaturai forces were responsible for their illness, such as king put under a \"Kong-Tau\" (a curse), in a period of bad luck in one's destiny cycle, or having bad feng shui (geomaacy). which can occur if one's anceston' tombs are dug in the wrong places or one's bouse faces the wrong direction. A 44-year-old very fashonably dressed jeweiry saleslady. suiteci that after she had moved out of her old house which had bad feng shui, she felt less tired, her son's academic performance had greatly improved, and her husband and she fought less over the phone (ber husband, based in Hong Kong is involved in China trade, and the family gathers together twi a yeu). Thc foi\u00eeowing is what she said about her house: I think the feng ski of niy OU house ~nar vety bad, becme the garage blocked the enmutce and that iniples there is no way out. Futtknnore, lwmbQr wos an wtIucky ruunber sowdrng likc everydoy is zero. (#14) Environmental pollution and sick building syndrome were cited as causes of their problem by 29 (58%) of the participants. A 56-year-old father of two (#43) had tremendous guilt for bringing a discarded but comparatively new vacuum cleaner home, because he and his family al1 sufiered from upper respiratory distress and fatigue atler inhaling dirt and feathers nom the vacuum cleaner. His wife and children recovered quickly, but his 90-year-old mother-in-law did not recover till she went back to Hong Kong for three months. However, the patient's symptoms persisted even after he had thrown the vacuum cleaner out for almost a year. He stated that his fatigue had affected his ability to work and his sexual perfonnaafe. Although his wife had ken very understanding, he was womed tbat his fatigue might eventualiy affect their marital relationship if it did not improve. Awther participant, a 31-year-old machine operator from China, considered that his fatigue was caused by the poor air quality at work. He alleged: There are chernica&s at work, especially in the area I work. Every place is closed ami there is no freslt air. Al& the glars doors ore shur tight.. I think dcfinitely poll~ion is a mure. Al1 the pollution und dirt in our environnent are bai for our heaith. (\u00fc29) Perceived Cause: Prominence Rankhgs Quantitative data from the perceived cause section of the EMIC showed that the participants (al1 except #27 who could not Uidicate which cause was the most important) reported the following as the one most important cause of theu eprticipants the inf\u00eeuence of migration on the above-mentioned causes, in the category of others (12%), al1 participants cited the impact of migration directly as the cause of their fatigue. Issues related to the impact of migration included: changing from king part of a major culture to being part of an ethnic miwrity, racism, leanhg to live in a multicultural society and getting dong with diverse cultural groups in the workplace, undenmployment or unemployment, drop in social status, language difficulties, unfamiliarity with social and health systerns, and adjustment to severe cold climate. Table 5 below depicts the mean scores of 12 clustered categones of perceived causes of the 50 participants. The possible range of the score is O to 10, and the range of scores reported by participants is O to 10. Al1 perceived causes, except social, are Ui the lower half of the range.

Other than their family doctors, al1 participants sought help from different practitioners and sources. They were often given alternative diagnoses or told that there was nothing wrong with the\u00f9 health. Such 'medical' advice made them feel discouraged, hsmted and disenchanted with their caregivers. One interviewee (#28) clahed that he had sought help from at least 10 Western doctors and many alternative medicine practitioners. Little improvement in their illness ami the quest for a cure accounted for this persistent help- seeking behaviour. Traditional Chinese medicine practised by Chung-i (literally uanslated as Chinese doctor) was the most preferred alternative treatment sought* Those who had not sought help from prnctitioners of traditional Chinese medicine stated that actually they would like to see a Chung-i, but they could not afford it as these pnctitioners' consultation fees were not covered by health insurance. Al1 respondents engaged in some form of self-help or sought help from theu families ancilor fiends to a certain extent. They found that families and fnends could be very helpful if they accepted that the patients were ill. However, they added to the patients' suffering by insisting that they behave 'aorrmlly\" and meet cormnitments to their fam\u00fcies. In general, most participants wen not satisfied with the help they acquired. The following themes emerged from the category of help-seeking khaviour: (A) Effective or not, family doctors have done theu best to help. (B) Traditional Chinese mdiciw may k effective but is too expensive as an ongoing treatment, (C) Western medicine cannot get to the rwts of the problem, @) Self-help sometimes works; fPmily and fkiends cm k helpful if they accept there is an illness, (E) For peace of mind, seek help fiom supernad sources, (F) Mental heaith practitiooets - can they help? A: Effective or not, fdy doctors have done the\u00f9 kst to help Most participants did not have high hopes of a cure from their family doctors, because the rnajority of them had seen a number of physicians to no avail. Others felt that their family doctors 'can on& help me temporady or just treat the symptums because on& Chung-i con get to the root of things. \" (#IO, a 21-year-old university student rnajoring in one of the health sciences) Although they knew that their family doctors were willing to help, they felt that the doctors had very little understanding of their illness. However. they did feel that it was important to be assessed and monitored by their family doctors using modem Western medical technology to rule out any major illnesses. Some patients, like a 46-year-old male postal worker, who was a graduate from one of the universities in Hong Kong, were disappointed that just ordinary diagnostic tests rather than more sophisticated ones were prescribed: I think that ordi~ry tests cm detect my problem. I may need some very special and in- depth tests to jind out my problem, but I have never had those yet. (#27) Satisfaction with Care In spite of their fatigue and other distress not king relieved, most patients still had great regard for their family doctors. Since most participants had sought help fiom various sources to no avail, their expectations of their doctors were relatively low. A willingaess to spend time listening and talking, and taking them seriously were considered as major reasons for choosing a particular physician as their family doctor. Reassuring patients that 'this (the illness) might be reiated to immigration CO CaltOdCt\" (#49) gave them hop because they could accept their ilhs as temporary and believe they would get better once tbey adjusted to Canadian iife. Giving words of encouragement, taking a holistic approach and addressing patients' and family members' concem beyond the patients' physical distress were looked upon as 'ercepttid for o daor to do \" (#a) and were key eIemnts in the satisfaction with are. A 3\u00fb-ym-oid Canadian traincd engimer who is studying for his second degne in commerce due to an inability to land a job in his field, summed up the sentiment of most participants who were satisfied with their fpmily doctors' can: I am happy wifh him since he aphins things in detuil to me. .. . I am satisfied with him. I don 't erpect him to help ne with my curtent problem, because I have seen nuury doctors before and none of them could help in this matter, so he should not be an exception. (#36) No concrete diagnosis given, 'taking too much blod (for tests), \" \"no medicatioas given \" and feeling that they were not king hear\u00fb were reasons rendered by the participants for dissatisfaction with care. For Chinese patients. from a tradition in which physicians' standard methods of diagnosis rely solely on observation, interrogation, paipation and auscultation with the physicians' senses only, the heavy dependence of Western trained physicians on modem technology diminished these patients' confidence in the doctors' judgment. Still embracing their forefathers' misconception of Westem medicine, some patients who went to a Western trained physician for a quick fix, felt cheated when ttiey were told that their illness was \"al1 in their mind.\" It was unthinkable to them that no rnedicine was prescribed. Although most laboratory tests, mch as urinalysis, were acceptable, many participants were reluctant to have repeated blood tests, because they believed that even a small sarnple of blood would drain their positive energy wg force), and Met weaken theu bodies. A 56-year-old business man alleged: He (doctor) relies heavily on &boratory tests and does not diagnose. No mncr what you tell hirn, #te thinks tluu I worry tm much ond it is in my mind. Tne mosf he wuld du is to tell me to have sonte x-ruys and l&ratory tests done. and the results are ahwys fine. mis N one of the refirrble wcrys to detect diseases, but it dops not work for my CO K... I do not invent tu illness or the symptom mysec it docs not corn jbn the mCnd. He should reafize tha my coniplaint is real. If doctors say ewrything is front the mind, then the patient will have nothing tu say. If this illness fum out tu be sumethhg seriou, he may bhme the patient for seeing hini too lare. A lot of doaors are like this, und I don? think he is the on& one. (#43) Some participants felt that theu physicians were not understanding or sympathetic to their situation. They felt that doctors fded to nalizt that: (1) the patients' illness was just o of 118 many things that they had to cope with, (2) patients had to work to eam theu wages, as most of them did not have siclmss benefits such as sick leave, and (3) it is very difficult to fiad a job in today's economic climate, even for local Canadians. Thus, many patients felt fnistrated when the physicians told them to take the off work to cest. It was ahost \u00fcke telling the poor to eat cake when they had no bread. A 45-year-old former high school teacher corn China, who worked as a machine operator in a factory, complained: I had told my doctor thar rny boss did not understand me, and thut created a lot of stress for me. He (docror) said, \"you should just quit your job.\" Did he not know that I have respo~t~ibilities? If1 do nof work, wke will I get m incme? (#3 1) For others, being told that \"there is nothing wrong\" by theu family doctor gave them no cornfort but robbed them of the support and concem of their once sympathetic love ones. A 36-year-old factory worker from China alleged : I'm rired all the rime. so I end up sleeping O lot. When my hrrsband cms home fron work, he always says. \"Why are you sleeping ail the time? nie doctor says there is nothing wrong, so why are you tired rrll the time?\" (#5) B: Traditional Cbinese medicine may be eff\u00e9ctive but is too expensive as an ongoing treatment Traditional Chinese medicine was by far the most utilized alternative treatment. Other modes of alternative medicine such as oaturopath, Shiatsu. aroma therapy, ndionic therapy. massage therapy were oniy used by two respondents (#16 and #28). The majority of the interviewees (42 or 84%) had sought help Born traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and those who had not (8 or 16%) were planning to see one in the friture. Although not al1 participants could obtain a diagmsis from their traditionai Chinese medicine ptactitioners, the followiag were diagnoses given to some of the participants by their traditional Chinese medicine practitioners3 : Flow of my blood is not very smooth. (#4) Don't have enough blood in my heart. (#S) I don 't have enough \"qi \" (vital energy), so I 'm yin und cold. (#9) I don't huve enough \"qi\" and my Yin Yang balance is off- (#IO) My spleen had degenerated. (# 12) My kidneys are \"xu mon (deficient and weak). (#13) He (Traditionai Chinese medicine practitioners) feft that I did not have enough blood and I had wet heat an\u00e0 wet toxin (too much umuppoted yang forces). (# 16) Imbalance inride alf rny inrental \"shen \" (dejicient and weak). (# 19) Treamients g iven b y traditionai Chinese medicine p ractitioners as recounted by the participants included: medicinal herbal teas and massage to rebalance the yin yang forces, acupuncture and acupresmre to open meridiam, cupping to suck out excessive yin force. Satisfaction with Care Traditional Chinese medicine practitionea were considered to be people who understood the tednology the participants used to explain their iliness, and who couid get to the roots of their problem in spite of requiring a longer treatrnent period. However, skepticism developed toward them becaw they did not employ investigation equipment, and did not have the medical qualifjring examinations that are associated with a hi& standard of care. Since their services are not covered by OHIP, the financial burden arising from such help ' These diagnoses shdd be iatefpreted in the context of traditional Chinese medicine, but not their literd meanhg in Western medicine. deterred a considerable nmkr of participants Born seeing or contiming to consult traditionai Chinese medicine practitioners or herbalists, the name generally used by the Canadian public (a misleadhg tem as apart \u20acrom using herbs. they also include ingredients mch as animal parts and mioerals in their prescriptions). Nevertheless, due to their desperation to fmd a cure and based on recommendation of family and fkiends, some interviewees felt obligated to give traditional Chinese medicine practitioners a try. Their opinions towards traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are summed up by the remarks of the following two participants, a 24- year-old mak university student (#18) and a 41-year-old housewife who is a student of English as a second language (#48). I m afiaid of Chung-i (traditionai Chinese medical doctor, herbufist), since there is 80 qrralifiing examination. This does not mean I do not &eh in the hic principles of Chinese herbal medicine or tmdilional Chinese treatment methods. It is that they are not like Western doctors who are reguluted by ruIes within a comprehensive system, have to sit for qucilifyig exorninations and whose license will be suspen\u00e0ed ifthey do something wrong. I am afaid that anyone cm practice medicine, dl \"Cheung Three\" and \"Lee Four\" \u00ffust about anyone) can practice medicine. There is no way to dlfeerntiate hm quaI@ed he is; is he a Hua T'o (a famous physician in Chinese history) or jurt sonieone who cheats for a living? (#18) Western doctors do not tuk ahut xu (defciency) or rico (iveakness) of the body that kind of thing, on@ Chung-i (traditional Chinese doctot, herbrrlistt) talkr like this. do not trust Chung-i (traditio~l Chinese doctor, herbafist), I have to give it a te. (#48) C: Western mddne cannot get to the rmts of the mbkm In addition to seeing their funily doctors, ail M participants had sought help Born other physicians of Western medicine (such doctors are calied Soi-i in the Chinese language). Some were looking for a second opinion fiom another family doctor; ohn were hoping that specialists, who were perceived as having more skills than family doctors, would be able to help them. Neurologists, rheumatologists, intemists, gynecologists, nephrologists (Some male patients told theu fam\u00fcy doctors that they ba\u00e2 a kidney problem and insisteci on such a 121 referral) and fdy physicians were among the Western doctors coIISUlted by the interviewees. When their hope for a cure was shttered, they tended to voice their dissatisfaction with this group of practitioners more readily than toward their family docton. Perhaps, they had a higher expectation of the speciaiists, or they were afkaid to be too critical of their family docton, knowing that they were the refenkg doctors of this study. Some patients. me a 64- year-old man from China who was laid off from his job as a cook, were very disappointed that Western doctors did not prescribe potent oral medication or injections as they expected: I have seen 3 different ductors, they didn't tell me anyrhing specifc. 1 found them very conservative in their treatment. No injection was given. Al1 of them soid that there was nothing wrong with me. (#13) Satisfaction witb Care Not spending enough tirne listening or examinuig the patient, not answering or giving very shon answers to their questions, delivering mixed or conflicting messages were the major cornplaints about this group of Western medicine practitioners. Those who had to wait for a long time for theu appohent, were particularly disappointed when they were left with the same or more questions unanswered. TheV last hope for a cure from Westem mdicine seemed to them to have vanished. Many were also very fnistrated when these doctors, most of whom were Chinese, did not comprehend the terminology of traditional Chinese medicine which the participants used to explain their symptoms, and did not cl&@ or admit that they did not derstand. Some participants, \u00eeike a 45-yearsld university commerce graduate ftom Chh who had just been laid off as a machine operator, resigned to the view tbat oae should not expect Western doctors to undentaad any concepts from traditional Chinese medicine: Different docturs said different things, some men said entireiy different things that nirrde you wonder whom to belikve .... I know nUIde aged people niay have kibey \"shmi\" (degeneration). so I usked the doctor al had kihey \"shuai\" (degeneration). but he sdd no. And it wm not spleen \"shuaiw (degeneration) neither- Of course. &i-i western doctors) do not blOW those tem. (#3 1) Th inability of the practitioner to assign a diagnosis oAen implied to them that the problem might be psychological. The patients were cesentfil about an acaiol referral to a mental health worker or even about the suggestion of such a referral. In addition, they often felt angry about the practitioners' failwe to admit theu inability to mat thek illness. The following is how a 43-year-oid man, former university student in psychology and law, who is now working as an astrologist. felt about Westem doctors: In the Western world, Sui-i, that is how they are trained in schoui: when your problem does not fir in the current medical knowledge, they will send you to a psychiatrist. l?zey (Western medicine) don't teach their dmtors to be humble, they won't admit that their medical knowledge is inadequate and they have not M the knowfedge needed to tteat this illness. Even if is the truth, they would not admit tu if, they wouk\u00ee say this is yuur fault. mis is how I feel. (#28) Many participants compared Western and traditional Chinese mdicine practitioners, without this king solicited. They felt that Westem doctoa treat patients according to their symptoms, \"If I have foot pain, they will just treat the fwr pain aithough the source of the problem is somewhere else.. .. They treat your head if you have a hea&che, and your foot if you luive foot pain\" (#19), while traditionai Chinese medicine practitioners mat them holistically by reniming their bodies back to balance. The following is the explanation given by a 45-year-old male machine operator from China on why he went to both Western and traditional Cbse medicine practitioners: I go to him Western doctor), because he cm do 106 tests and blod tests. Chwtg-i (ttaditio~l Chinese medicine practitioners. herbalists) cannot do those things.. . . They (Western ductors). tliey do not mn know ifyou are tired, because this (fatigue) is something you cm feel but other people cannot see.. . . Afer I rea\u00e0 a few of those Chung-i reports, I feel that tky nrake a lut of sense. As for the Sai-i (western doctor). they stop r\u00eeght here, and they tell me that I MI O@, but you still feel unweii. Then, you sense that these people (Western doetors) may not believe what you have told them. You should do this and that, bu they never constder that your '%hinggShenW (vitality) is poor.... Soi4 does not give you medicine, ewn if he w~nts to he@ you, he wouU say \"what CM I give you? Antibiotics?\" mre is na uny port of you that ha an iaection. Medication fo stop the pain? me is not nucch pain to stop. niere is no way to heip. Chung-i would say th? my \"ching-lock\" (channels Md collorerals) are no? open (bloc&) or balanced. If my \"ching-lock \" are open, I should be okay. (#3 1) D: Scll-help sometimes works; fdy and friends can be helpful if they accept there is an illaess Al1 participants engaged in self-help to a certain extent; they felt that \u00eehey had to try their best to help themselves in the course of seeking help. Unfortunately , none of the treatments they obtahed could lift them frorn the\u00fb fatigue and consequently, they felt they had to rely on self-help strategies. Their self-help practices can be grouped as follows: Foods and remedies Drinking soups or teas prepared with different kinds of herbs and remedies were the most comrnon self-help practices. Chicken, pork liver and pork brain, beef and turtles were favourite foods and soup stocks. Chinese medications that could strengthen ''yang\" (male energy) or hprove kidney weakness, such as \"essence of deer tail (der penis), \" \"tong-swn \" and \" hou-gay-~e \" were popular choices . Some participants claimed chat they felt better after they had taken these foods and remedies. Vitamin B, which was considered as a vitamin that could strengthen one's body, was also very popuiar among the participants. Self psychotherapy Trying not to think about one's cumnt situation and future events too often, attempting not to demand too much fkom oneself, having a good long cry alone and relaxing by watchiag Chinese comedy vidws and iistening to pleasant music were the strategies ahost al1 participants used to cope with their stress. Becionhg know1edgeable Almost al1 the participants read extensively on the topic of fatigue to obtain as much information about tkir iliness as possible. Their resow included books, magazines and newspapers in both English and Chinese published locally or at their place of origin. Most of hm also tmk advantage of Uifonaation provided by the electroaic mas media on the topics of fatigue, CFS and ruurasthenia. Tbey olkn watched du two Cbintst TV channeis aad listemi to the five Chinese radio stations whik pmgrams on w medical developments d Mth issues werc prrscntcd. 124 Chan- \u00dcfks@le The following cbanges in lifestyles were reported by most participants: (1) changed eating habits including eating more vegetables and Iess meat; (2) quit smoking and avoided alcohol; (3) plamed and divided activities setting regular SC hedule for daily routine such as meais and exercises, (4) relaxed as often as possible and engaged in various types of non-strenuous exercises, such as Qi-Kung and Tai Chi, (5) listened to music. Two participants (# 33 and # 39), a 41-year-old woman whose husband is in Hong Kong and a 38-yearsld man who is an industrial engineer turned fashion designer, concludeci that there was only one way to facilitate the recovery of their illness: to go back to Hong Kong or move out of Toronto. They claimed that they actudly felt better as they started the process of planning to leave Toronto. See king social support Talking to fdly members, close niends and joining sel f-hel p groups for new immigrants at community centres were the most common sources of social support the participants sought. Seeking spiritual help Some participants said that they became more spiritual after the onset of their illness. Those who were Christians, went to churcb to pray and read the Bible more oflen. Those who were Buddhists or believers in traditional Chinese religions went to Buddhia or Taoist temples to worship their gods and ask for blessings; they tended to take a fatalistic view of their illness, by attributhg it to fate and believing that al1 they could do was just to weather things out. Some even reamnged the Wture in their houses to improvejkng shui. Fan@ and triends Feeling supported and understaal by famiiy and niends was considered very important in helpiog the participants to cope with th& illness. Conversely, lack of support, understanding or acceptnnce on the part of family and fnends made some participants feel betrayed or helpless. Trying to sangthen the patients' ymg force by giving thm mnics Chia#rc medicinal herbe wu the mwrt cornmon form of help kir families and close friends bestowed on the participants. Tangible materials or services, such as prepared food or remedies, baby-sitting or rides were perceived as gestures of caring and appreciated much more by the participants than verbal support or advice. Some participants, who had sponsored relatives to corne to Canada, were resentful about the latter's lack of support. They klt that theu relatives at least should help them financidly. if they could not offer other assistance, since theu illness had put hem in financial difficulty. Those interviewees. who felt misunderstood or who were accused of king lazy or pretending to have an illness by their loved ones (as they were told by theu physicians that there was nothing wrong with them). experienced more distress. As iilustrated by a 46-year-old &ed man ftom Hong Kong: She (wife) does not understand me an\u00e0 said that \"you think I unt not tired?\" She ?hi& that I am preten\u00e0ing that I am sick, because if I am sick, then I don 't have to do cenain things.. . .

(#15) E: For peace of mind: seek help from supernaturd sources Faith healers, Christian ministers, feng shui and Kong-Tau masters (sorneo who is capable of planting an illness or laying a curse on another person ud is able to tell if one is under Kong-Tau) were consulted by 35 (7096) participants. Tbey claimed chat they did not bekve theu iiiness could be cured by these non-medical people, but they usually would feel better knowing that they ha\u00e2 iried every means. A 27-year-old engincer from Hong Cruisticrn rniCnisrer prayed Md wdrnd the &vil to leave my &n& (#a) 126 Exhausted by caring for her 17-year-old schizophrenic son al1 on her own (her husband worked in China), a 47-year-old woman \u20actom Hong Kong \" hired a feng shui (geomancy) specia\u00eeisr to rearrange the funiiture\" (#21) in her house, so that the health of her family members would be improved. F: Mental health practitioners - can they heip? Fifieen (30%) participants had sought help \u20acrom mental health practitioners. mainly psychiatrists. Most participants did not think mental health practitioners could offer any help for their problem as they felt their distress was primariiy physical and they were not menully \u00fcl. Those who were referred felt that this was because ihir family doctors did not know how to mat them, and because they thought that they were refemd to mental health practitioners when they were not able to fmd a physical cause. Some interviewees wanted to see a mental health professional, but were discouraged from doing so by family members, for fear of stigma aff\u00e9cting the patients and their family members. There was a sentiment expressed by these patients that consuiting a psychiatrist was equivaknt to declaring a family member insane. Ten participants who had seen mental health practitioners were given different explanations of the causes of their problem. mainly surroundhg their social situation and He @sychiattist) to\u00f9i tne that there was nothing wrmg with me und it was just because of my faniily @robfem)), my nYjmtment to immigration. (#8) He said that I was pessinustic, it was not depression. (#17) Satisfaction with Care In genetal, those participants who sought help from mental health workers had very Merent experiewes and opinions about thek care. Some appreciated the the th& psychhbis took to help \u00eehem. 'I th\u00eenk that the psychirrtrist (Dr. Y.) is the niau 127 helpfui although he crinnot solve my problem. He tried to anaiyze if with me, but he wcls not able to help me. \" (#17) While othen felt that more tirne should be given to them, like the following 34-year-old female receptionist. who expressed: He spent very linle tirne talking to me, just about 10 to 20 minutes taking &ut my problem. He prescribed medicaiiions (sleeping pills) to me, asked me to let things go and told me nor to be so tense, but try to relm. (#a) Help-Seeking Bebviouc: Rominence Rankings Quantitative data fiom the help-seeking section of the EMIC showed that their family physicians, traditional Chinese medicine and Western mdicine practitioners were the main sources and most satisfjhg fom of heip for the participants. Table 6 below depicts the prominence scores of the 8 clustered cetegories of causes perceivecl by the 50 participants. The possible range of the score is from O to 17. The range of scores reported by the participants was O to 17. As show in the mean scores, al1 scores were in the lower one third of the range indicating a relatively low level of satisfaction with care from the patients' perspective.

To determine whether demographic data of the participants had an influence on the major variables of patterns of distress, stigma, perceived cause and help-seelring behaviour, t tests. ANOVA and Pearson r were employed. Post hoc comparisons, using the Tukey-HSD test, were made after an ANOVA had resulted in a significant F test to determine which means were significantly different fkom each other. With signifkme level set at 0.05, no significant association was found ammg demographic data or between demographic data and grouped patterns of distress scores. There were significant dinerences found ktween stigma and place of migration, using the Tukey- HSD test. Those fiom China were fouad to have higher stigma scores than their Hong Kong and Southeast Asia counterparts (F,, , = 3.29, p = 0.046). There were ais0 significant differences for places of binh a.nd the perceived cause of victimlabuse. Participants, who were born in Hong Kong were more prone to have a perceived cause as victimfabuse more so than their counterparts whose binh places were Chha or Southeast Asia (F,, , = 7.62, p = 0.0014). Although it was not saongly cornlated, correlation coef\u20ac\u00eecients of age and perceived cause in\u00e2icated that age was positively correlated with a perceived cause that was medical (r = 0.3813, p = 0.06) and aegatively to one that was socially based (r = -0.3108, p = 0.028). This suggests that older were more likely than younger participants to attribute the cause of their fatigue to medical factor the reverse was true for socul causes. Length of tune in Canada (r = 0.4006, p = 0.004) and years of education (r = 0.3023, p = 0.033) were positively comlated to seekhg help from mental health practitioners, indicathg that higher level of acculturation ami better educatioa may have motivated participants to have better acceptaM'R of menta\u00ef Wth practitioners as caregivers- Grouped scores of the variables of patterns of distress, stigma, prceived causes and help- seeking behaviour were used in the examination of their relationships.

Their own opinions and the\u00f9 family's thoughts with regard to how these three illnesses should be treated were also solicited. Data obtained in this section provided a backdrop against which explanatory models of CF can be interpreted (see Appendix H, p.306). Brief Case Vignettes Participants claimed that theu illness had a major impact on many aspects of theu life, including their level of physical hctioning, job or study puformance, psychological well king and self esteem, interpersonal relationships, underernployment and unemployment. Their distress fiom CF was exacerbated by other competing challenges, such as the stresses fiom deaiing with (1) a relative lack of understanding fiom family members, caregivers, finends and bosses, (2) cultural role conflicts and (3) negotiating diffetences in values and beliefs in Canada To provide a context and to portray the persoas behind the quotations, themes and statistics presented, the following are two brief case vignettes thpt offer narratives relathg to the suffering fkom fatigue: Case 1: #32 Mr. S. was a 52-year-old biochemist who immigrated to Canada hm China seven years pnor to the inte~ew. He was ded and living with bis wife and her parents. He claimed that he had ban dering hm fatigue, pain in his Lower back and shodders for the past few years. Mt. S. felt that his \u00fbeaith problem was the dt of (1) the natue of his body king vay \"xrc ruo\" 134 (weak and deficient) fiom birth, (2) his conflicts with his wife and in-laws, (3) overwork as he had to care for his wife who suffered fiom schizophrenia, (4) king taken advantage of by his colleagues at work because of racial discrimination, and (5) fnstration of being underemployed and constant kat of unemployment. Mr. S. expressed that he was not living the life that he expccted when he fust arrived in Toronto full of optimism. Instead, he was leading the disillusioned life of many foreign-trained professionals whose credentials and work experiences were not recognized. Prior to his Unmigration to Canada, he had worked as a researcher in a prestigious research institute in Beijing. China. His former colleagues who remained in China or who mignted to the United States, had become scientists or research associates. However, he was unable to aCtain such achievements in Canada, as his credentials were not accepteci. At the tirne of interview, he was working as a laboratory technician \"assistng other people 's research\" and constantly living in fear that his CO-workers, who were Canadians by birth, would blame him for their errors. knowing that he had difficulty in defending hirnself in English. Mr. S. attributed his fatigue to long workhg hours including evenings and racial discrimination in the workplace. Another major source of fatigue was the eaergy required to care for his schizophrenic wife and the constant confiicts with her and her parents about the management of her illness. Mr. S. felt that his in-laws corruneci with theu daughter that she was not il1 and thus had \"no need\" for medication, because they did not want to be associateci with the stigma of having a mentaIiy fi1 daughter. Of course, kir advice would be detrimcntal to her health. For fear of king despised by otkrs, Mr. S. did mt tell any of his \u20acrie& or co-worken about his iliness. He was a Christian and he knew that he could obtain etnotional support by asking ppIe in bis church to pray for him. However, he did not \"want nry own und fmnly 135 problem to becorne hown to everybody,\" he decided to keep them to himself (he had the highest total stigma score among a11 the participants 35/36). He had attempted to help himself by reading health-related books and eating special foods prepared with Chinese remedies. He also sought help for bis problem from multiple sources but to no avail. AAer king found falling asleep at work by one of his CO-workers, he wondered how long he could pretend that there was nothing wrong with his energy. He was exaemely womed about his and his family's livelihood should he wt be able to continue to work dw to his fatigue, or should he be dismisseci as a resuli of his substandard performance at work. Case 2: # 30 Mrs. C. was a 53-yearsld unemployed teacher who lived with her husband and two daughten in Toronto. She irnmigrated to Canada with her family five years ago due to the political uncertainty of Hong Kong, after its retum to Chinese sovereignty. Mrs. C. claimed that she was suffering fiom CFS, a diagnosis not given by her doctor but one she had leamed about from reading a newspaper. She said that al1 her symptoms fitted the description of CFS. \"I am tired to the point that I don P use the term, 'tired' but I would use the word, Dxhrmsed' to describe my condition,\" stated Mrs. C. In spite of having a college education and work experience as an English teacher in Hong Kong for more than a decade, Mrs. C. was confionteci with the grim reality of not king able to land a similar job in Toronto. Unlike her, het husband was fortunate to be able to continue in his profession and worked as a Mathematics teacher in a high schml. As the only bread winner, he was responsible for dehying al1 the day-to-day expenses of the household, but the fbly savings were dwindiing. Although they were not living in abject poverty, they were ppiesently LeadiDg a much humbler exhtence in cornparison with thtir fomm luxury and cornforts in Hong 136 Kong. CF shattered Mrs. C's drearn of imprdng their living standard. Prior to coming to Canada, Mrs. C. prided herself on king a Liberated career woman, a pioneer among Chinese women of her era. She pulled her weight, including financially, in the family and always had maids in the house to take care of the household chores. Mer immigration to Canada, she felt that her self-esteem had diminished, and her confidence plummeted. Although she was an experienced English teacher, she had difficulty understanding the English spoken by Canadians and her own sofi-spoken English was not comprehended. She lost hope and confidence in being able to fuid a comparable job as an English teacher in Canada. Mrs. C. ascribed her present state of health to the effects of immigration to Canada. She attributed much of her fatigue to overwork as she was not used to doing household chores or engaging in physical labour. Her initial exhilaration of coming to a de haven, Canada, was unforhmately followed by years of disillusionment both for herself and her family. Like Mr. S. in the previous case vignette, Mrs. C. ascribed her fatigue to social and contextual problems nsulting from the adjustment to a new life in Canada. In spite of her wish to rem to Hong Kong permanentiy which she believed would \"cure\" her, sbe knew that she had to stay in Canada for her family's sake. Mrs. C. sought help fiom multiple sources to reduce the distress she was experiencing - includhg participating in the current study which her family doctor had told her that she would benefit hm just talking about her illness. s-='Y Study fiadings have ken presented in relation to the thamicd tiamework and research questions. In addition to fatigue aad wePLness, infamants suffered ftom dy somatic and the\u00f9 and the iaability to Iive up to their culW values of hard work, participants felt stigmatized both for themselves and 137 their families. They blamed their migration to Canada as the Uistigator of theu illness, and indicated that social dishannony and ovenvork were the most prominent perceived causes of their fatigue. Informants sought help from multiple sources. Western physicians' lack of understanding of patients' social milieu and cultural health beliefs rendered participants feeling dissatisfied. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were regarded as being \"able to get to the root of the illness,\" but financial constraints deterred help-seeking from this group of caregiven. nie lived experience of suffering fiom CF was \u00fclustrated through the presentation of two case vignettes. Following the interviews, seved participants commented on what they described as a therapeutic effect. They commented that it helped put theu problems into a context, define its boudaries, explore its possible rneanings and implications, forge new connections, and give hem an opportunity to express themselves to someone at length about their current situation. Although these cases are not 'representative' in any statistical sense, they portray and represent important aspects of illness experience of Chinese patients with CF. They are powefil, albeit idiosyncratic, illustrations of this group of patients in my study. The concept of CFS was completely foreign to most participants. The majonty was not sure what it was and what they were suffiering fiom. Most of the\u00f9 explanatory models were mainly sociosomatic in nature. This is distinctively different hm those subscribed to by many CFS patients described in the literature reviewed, who typically would attribute their illness to a physical cause. Chapter M DISCUSSION The intent of this study was to present a clinical ethnography of Chinese immigrants with CF and weakness to health care workers to give them a better understanding of the illness experience of t&is group of patients. Results of this study show that participants' illness expenences were shaped by the social and cultural context of king first generation Unmigrants in a foreign land. The findings provide insight into the illness experience of first generation Chinese Canadians, specifically with respect to health beliefs, meaning, cophg and social impact of CF and weakness on their lives. The discussion of the results of this study is divided into four main sections addressing: the descriptive data, interrelationships among the major categories and, fuially, the limitations of the mdy. The bulk of this chapter is comprised by the first section dealing with the descriptive qualitative and quantitative data It is organized around the four major categories of this study, patterns of distress, stigrna, perceived cause and helpseeking behaviour. For each of these categories the discussion begins with an overview of the fmdings and then references the theoreticai fiamework, Chinese culture and bcliefs, the participants' General Illness Beliefs (Appendix H, p.306) as gmered from this research, and celated research and descriptive literature as appmpnate. Patterns of Distress Al1 participants of this study cited the onset of their fatigue as gradual, and said it took them almost a year to realize that they needed to seek help. Gradua1 onset cases of CF have been linked to a greater number of stressfbl life events and illnesses in the year prior to illness onset compared to the\u00f9 sudden onset counterparts (Mawle, 1997). This observation is confirmed in the present study, as most of them had encountered different challenging life events associated with their experience as immigrants. Ti..- vast majority of the intonnants also considered their illness to be serious; al1 of whom were living with a compromised level of f\u00f9nctioning, and almost half of them not working. This finding is in concert with Petrie, Moss-Moms and Weinman's (1995) results of a swey of 282 CFS sufferers who also found that those who perceived their condition as \"cataswphic\" (senous) showed greater disability in tems of their sleep and rest, social communication, and recreational activities. Lock (1993) suggested that symptoms often function as a medium of communication, whether or not they are so intended by the patient. As the iafonnants' narratives unfolded, the progression of their suffering as victims of CF and as newcomets to a fonign land, they revealed multiple distresses. Similar to Chinese neurasthenia patients in Kleinman's snidy (1982), the majority of them reported an average of 7 symptoms. Of the 50 participants, 84% wbo were able to pinpoint the most troubling aspect of their problem, 74% alleged somatic distress; non-somatic distress was much downpiayed by most of the inforrnants. A combination of somatic, psychological and social distress mis aiieged by only 19% of the respondents as most troub\u00fcng. This is in keephg with Kleinman's (1982) report that the majority (78%) of Chinese neurasthenic patients Md their ilhess as \"organic.\" 140 In a study of 13 1 female CF patients and their husbands, Goodwin (1997) suggests that women who are better educated have fewer symptoms. It is speculated that women with higher education levels have jobs and interests that are less physically taxing, resulting in physically limiting symptoms king less problematic. Education also provides women with a bouder scope of coping abilities, social support, and other resources. However, findings of the current study show that gender, educational level, marital status, or length of marriage, statistically do not have an impact on the symptoms experienced by the participants. Goodwin's (1997) study is quantitative and does not have an Asian sample, making it dificult to compare the rationale be hind these subjects ' responses. Samatic Distress Overview of Findings The majority of the participants claimed that fatigue and symptoms of a physical nature were intrusive and negatively affected their daily life. Their fatigue is Mer aggravated by sleep disturbance which at times even endangered thek Lives, such as falling asleep when operating a vehicle or machinery. Other than fatigue and sleep disturbance, a constellation of somatic symptoms none of which was found to have an organic etiology, were reported by the informants. These discornforts included pain, gastrointestinal discornfort, dizziness, cold symptoms and sexual dyshction. Most claimed that these distresses developed gradually after they immigrated to Canada Three interrelateci themes were delineated in the category of somatic distress, and each will be explored under the heading of \"discussion of fmdings\" below: (A) Fatigue and weakness are the most distresshg symptoms, (B) Sleep disturbance is both a distress and a some of fatigue, (C) Somatic discodort is incorporatcd as part of one's Me. Discussion of Findiags A: Fatigue and weakness are the most distresshg symptoms Al1 informants alleged that fatigue and weakness were their most distressing symptoms, that negatively af5ected al1 aspects of their activities of daily living. This contrasts to Yu's (1994) study, in which only 7% of her patients cited fatigue and weakness as their most troubling symptoms. As stated earlier, subjects in her study expected their lifestyle to cause hem fatigue; fatigue was generally identified as the consequence of Uisomnia or pain, rather than a primary problem. Informants of the curent study probably were more willing to present fatigue and weahess as symptoms, since these are distresses often portrayed in the Chinese Canadian mass media. Also, as former sedentary workers forced into physically laborious jobs due to migration, they might have believed that fatigue is more acceptable as a symptom. Furtherrnore, the selection criteria of \"either persistent and distressing complaints of increased fatigue after mental effort, or persistent and distressing complaints of bodily weakness and exhaustion after minimal effort,\" rnight have introduced a bias towards refed of subjects who presented fatigue as their most disttessing symptom rather than as one of their distresses. B: Sleep disturbance is bath a distress and a source of fatigue Almost al1 (86%) the patients in this study reported that sleep disturbance was one of their most distressing symptoms. Studies of largely Caucasian CF subjects with medically unexplained physical symptoms also showed that sleep distutbance is one of the most problematic symptoms (Famet et al., 1995; ffipp et al., 1993; Moldofsky, 1989; Momss et al., 1993). However, despite the participants' persistent sleep disturbance, no refenal to specialists or other ment was offered, and sleeping p\u00fcls were prescribed only sporadidy. Being new 142 immigrants, informants were unaware of the availability of such senrices, thus forcing them to [ive with intense suffering without help. C: Somatic discornfort is iacorporated as part of one's life Al1 participants revealed that they had learned to accepted multiple somatic distress as part of life with over half complaining of pain or headaches, 20% gastrointestinal discodort and cold symptoms, dizziness or sexual dysfunction for the odier. Since none of the symptoms was found to have an organic base, no treatment was given by their physicians. Their symptoms were presented in both traditional Chinese and Western medicai tenninology reflecting the influence of these two traditions in participants' explanatory models of illness. As culturai idioms, somatic symptoms express discodort and distress in ways that are intelligible wiihin the individuai's social milieu but may have different meanings to outsiders, including their physicians. The meanings expressed through these idioms are ofien fhgmentary, tentative, and even contradictory (Kirmayer & Young, 1998), especially when two relatively distinct paradigms (traditional Chinese and Western) were employed interchangeably. In Western medical paradigm, symptoms without an organic base are regarded as somatization \"with the assumption that its real meaning is an underlying affective disturbance\" (Kleinman, 1982). Sornatization has ken found to be comrnon in CF patients in the larger culture (Manu et al., 1993). Somatization is defined as 'Yhe presentation of physical symptoms in the absence of organic pathology or the application of physical cornplaints accompanying organic absence beyond what can be accounted for by physiology\" (Katon, Kleuimaa, & Rosen, 1982). The term somatization Unplies that mental processes are causing somatic symptoms and is, hence, essentidiy dualistic - a conapt inherent in the Western cul\u00eeurai ideology of the person (Kirmayet & Young, 1998). 143 Although its prevalence and specific features vary considerably across cultures, the process of focusing on, amplifLing, and clinically presenting somatic distress are universal and somatic symptoms are the most common clinical expression of emotional distress world-wide (Isaac, Janca, & Orley, 1996). Nonetheless. research suggests that somatization is more cornmon in non- Western countries (Sue & Sue, 1990). With over 70% of al1 maniciad belonging to non-Western cultures (Triandis, 1995), somatization exerts a much greater impact on patients from other cultures than Western. It has ken speculated that, the high rate of somatization amongst Asians is because they are socialized to express their symptoms of emotionai dis\u00fbess in ways that are appropriate or acceptable to others in their culture, yet are viewed by Western practitioners as somatization (Brislin, 1 993). Somatization is more highly elaborated among Chinese than Caucasian North Amencan (Kleinman, 1980). Kleinman and Good (1985b) reported a higher fiequency of somatic complaints by Asian depressive patients, including Chinese, than European Americans. Traditionally, Chinese hold a holistic view of the mlnd and body (Chetmg, F. & Lau, 1982). Since Chinese do not devote separate attention to mental and physical illnesses, emotions are considered to play a role in the etiology of both types of illnesses (Lia, K. M., 198 1). Gaw (1993) asserts that somatization is prominent in Chinese Americans, because of the close correspondences between emotions and body organs in Chinese traditional medicine, so that expression of physical complaints is more socially acceptable than emotionai complaints. It has also been argwd that in a socioceniric culture, such as the Chhese that emphasizes the relational self rather than an individual self (Hsu, F., 1971; King & Bond, 1985), physical symptoms which are culhurilly sanctioned will be more common than psychologicai ones ('Meinman & Kieinrnan, 1986). Thus, somatization of psychological problems may be an adaptive coping mechaaiSm as it mobiiks social support hm the f&y and the community, 144 pmvides relief from routine responsibilities (Lin. E., Carter, & Kleinman, L985), and reconfigures family relationships and other social roles (Kirmayer & Young, 1998). Somatization also allows displacement of psychic conflicts that in themselves are not acceptable (Kleinman, 1986), and avoids the stigma or shame associated with reporting psychological problems (Xu, L 987). This mechanisrn may explain some of the physical symptoms reported by participants in this study . Kleinrnan (1980) alleges that the socialization process in the Chinese culture teaches its people to suppress dysphoric emotions, and when these emotions are experienced, to channel them into a somatic idiom of communication. He reveals: 1 ofien have felt exasperated and helpless trying to get Chinese patients to talk about a specific dysphoric afTect. Patients who have told me they are feeling depressed or amious or nightened, for example, seemiagly cannot go beyond naming the feeling .... They appear to lack the more refheci terminology for what they are feeling (p. 141). Cheung, F. and CO-workers (1981) counter that the Chinese cognitive style of communicating inward feelings in outward somatic ternis rather than unconscious denial is the rationale behind sornatic labelling of illnesses. In thek study of Chinese with depression, they reported that when asked \u00e2irectly these patients were able to recognize and admit psychological symptoms of depression. Cheung, F. (1 985) argues that in Chinese the very language of affect is in somatic terms, which may create a misconception that Chinese patients are more likely to somath. Depression or sadness is xin yu 'bpres~ure on the hart,\" fnsttation and irritation is qi ding 'bblockhg of air,\" psychosexual difficulty is shen kuei \"kidney weakness,\" and rage is gan huo, 'Tire in the liver.\" Kleinman and Kleinman (1986) concur that perhaps with its highly \"somatized language\" the Chinese Ianguage has \"a culaual code of metaphors of psychologid problems\" (p.54-55). 145 The current f\u00efndings are in agreement with those of Cheung. F. and CO-workers (1981). Despite multiple somatic symptoms reported by Uifomants, most showed no hesitation in presenting mood symptoms such as feeling depressed and anxious when asked specificaily if they were sufEering fiom other distress than somatic. This is in contrast to the conception that Chinese patients are unable to reveal their psychological distress (Young & Xiao, 1993). Overview of Findings In cornparison to somatic distress, psychological difficulties played a much lesser role in the participants' patterns of distress. However, over half (58%) ceportcd impairments in social or personal fhctioning, and half reported depression. As a result, informants' ability in meeting personal and family commitments was compromised. Lack of concentration and impaired memory med activities, such as the operation of machinery and driving a vehicle, into life threatening situations, and, ieaming English into an insunnountable task. They felt anxious over the prognosis of their illness and theu chance of dval in Canada without the cornmand of the Canadian social protocol or official languages. Three main themes were identified fiom the findings: (A) Impairment in social bctioning aml feeling depressed hinder fullilment of family obligations and personal goals, (B) Cognitive impairment hampers seif'onfidence, par&icularly with regard to social and occupationai des, (C) Living in a foMgn land produces feelings of anxiety. Discussion of Findhgs A: Impairment in social functioning and feeling depressed hinder fullilment of family obligations and personal goals Most of the respondents felt depressed and did not have the motivation to pursue and excel in theu career or assume their familial responsibilities. Even with obvious symptoms of depression, none of the infamants had ever been diagnosed with depression. This is in keeping with reports in primary care of the larger culture: despite symptoms of depression king found in 56% of the patients with CF, no diagnoses were ever made (Kroenke et al., 1988). Moreover, lack of English proficiency has also been found to relate to higher depression and paranoia rates amongst migrants (Westermeyer, 1989). Since English proficiency was limited for most participants of this study, they may have been at incceased nsk for depression. The severity of patients' depressed mood has also been alleged to have a direct impact on the\u00f9 cognitive functioning (Wearden Br Appleby, 1997) - a finding this study shares and is discussed in theme (B) below: B: Cognitive impairment hampen self-confidence, particularly with regard to social and occupa tional roles Cognitive impairment, reported by 38% of participants in this study, is one of their most diwbing symptoms, and a major factor affecthg their level of functioning and employment. These findings are in concert with most other research, in which cognitive dysf'unction, such as poor concentration and memory, are comrnon amongst patients with CF (Joyce, Blumenthal, & Wessely, 1996; Kornamff & Buchwald, 1991; Marshall, Forstot, Callies, Peterson, & Schenck, 1997; McDonald, Cope, & David, 1993). This cognitive imphment may k subjective der thsn objective. Kane and colleagues (1997) reported tha\u00ee, when cornparhg 17 CFS patients to 17 Mthy wnmIs, CFS patients had 147 significantly higher levels of somatization and depression, but no ciifference in their cognitive functioning. However, the small sample size in this study limits the validity of the findings. C: Living in a foreip land produces feeiings of anxiety Many informants attributed their ahviety to a lack of English proficiency, which compromised their abilities to register important information fiom relevant visual, auditory channels to communicate verbally, and consequently, their sense of confidence. For many immigrants, leaming English is a major problem, and requins them to devote time which could othemise be spent to eaming a living (Lock, 1990). For those who carne to Canada in their late teens or as aduits, the need to support themselves denied them opportunities to leam English. Even for those who were fortunate enough to be able to enrol in ESL (English as a second language) courses as adult leamers, leaming a new language turned out to be far more difficult that they had anticipated. Grinberg and Grinberg (1984) state: When learning a new language, an adult leam vocabulary and grammar in a rational manner; but not the accent, intonation, and rhythm, that is the 'music' of the language, can only be imitated and incorpocated through identification with the speaker of the language (p. 30). Depending on the\u00f9 age, immigrants may never be able to tnily express themselves in the language of the host country. Some may feel alieaated to their sunouridings, and disguised when using the new language, \"as though they had lost the language which they feel to be authentidy theirs\" (Grinberg & GRnberg, 1984, p. 30). Since language is the key to a new culture, language proficiency thus determines, to a large extent, the success of the adaptation pmcess of immigrants; accordingiy, they are socially and psychologically disadvantaged (Furnham & Li 1993). Name of the Problem Overview of Findings For most informants the condition was not an entity. but rather a collection of symptoms. Amongst those (88%) who named their problem, more than half (57%) gave a CF related narne, such as Fatigue. Neurasthenia, CFS and Yuppie Flu. Names expressed in traditional Chinese medicine, such as Mo Ching Shen (no vitality) and Shen Kuei (kidney weakness), were given by over 18 % of the respondents. Discussion of Findlngs Every culture has specific systerns for lakliing Wss and disease States (Waxler, 1981). hclusiveness is the that certain s ymptoms , behaviours, and treatmnts w\u00fcl correspond to the given culture's definition of illness. Cultural styles of expressing distress are infiuenced not only by cultural beliefs and practices, but also by familiarity with health care systerns and pathways to care (Kirmayer & Young, 1998). Yu (1994) reported, in her study in Hong Kong, that 72% of patients with CF and weakness called their problem neurasthenia, none called it CFS, and nearly al1 stated that they had never heard of CFS befon. Fatigue was not considered by thern to be a medical problem, since it was expected in a busy city such as Hong Kong. More participants (13 or 26%) of the current study named their problem fatigue (highest kquency of names given), in tune with the mass media in Canada. None of the 100 neutasthenic study participants in Kleinman's (1982) study in China named the\u00f9 \u00fciness in traditional Chinese medicd ternis. These cesunchers speculated that in the biomedical setting of the study, patients were hesitant to give mimes in the termhology of traditionai Chinese medicine. This is less so in the cament study, in which 18% of the 149 participants named their illness using the traditional Chinese medical tenns, although the study took place in a Canadian hospital. Perhaps, out of respect for Kleinman as a Caucasian and a physician of Western medicine, his subjects were reluctant to use traditional Chinese medical terms with hirn. Because the interviewer in the present study is an ethnic Chinese, who speaks their language, they might have believed she could understand traditional Chinese medical terminology. However, the vast majority (82%) did not name their illness in traditional Chinese medical terms. Since al1 subjects were referred by farnily physicians, this might have exerted some Uifluence on their responses. Possibly, if patients were recniited fiom traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and interviews were conducted in a non-Western medical setthg, they might be more conducive to affirmation of traditional Chinese medical concepts. It may dso be that knowledge of an entity is different hm experience of an entity. Personai symptoms are not translated into cultural categories as one might expect fiom knowledge of the framework. This may demonstrate that just because the categories exist, they are not necessarily appealing. stigma Ovewiew of Findings Infomiants believed that it was best not to disclose their ilIness for the foUowing reasons: (1) there was no practical gain hm telling others, (2) the ladc of understadhg of CF by others, including one's family members and physicians. and (3) the ri& of being labelled as \"lazy\" by others. Many cond tha\u00ee it was a \"cultural thing\" for Chinese people to keep things to themselves or within the family. Perceived rdcations of didosure included: jeopardiziag existing an\u00e2 potentiai prospects for and crea\u00eeing concems for family members, and nmning f\u00e0rniiies prefer to conceal their iliness for similar rrasons. Shce they were no longer capable of Wlhg farnily obligations, they thought less of themselves, felt that they had lost face and were thus despised by others. They were preoccupied with the stigma associated with their illness which they thought wouid affect hem and the\u00f9 family members. The following themes evolved hm the findings of stigrna: (A) Avoid disclosure if at al1 possible, (B) Others' knowledge of one's illness would affect one's chance of getting married or one's (C) Family preferred concealhg patient's condition, (D) Feeling ashamed and inferior, and (E) Fear of negative effects on the family. Discussion of Findings A: Avoid disclosure if at al1 bossible Chinese immigrants in this study were reluctant to share information about their illness with othen, because of \"shame\" about their fatigue and their need to save face. Despite \u00fcving in the same city, some had yet to share their distress with extended fjunily members. This secrecy may be related to the attitude amongst Chinese that expressing one's feelings overtly is regarded as an admission of weakness in one's character, as weli as an assauit on social hamiony (Cheung, F., 1982). Avoidiance of disdosure rnight also be a personal coping strategy of mniimil9tion and denial of theu symptoms - a psychologid mechaairmi that is perhaps complementary to the social pcocess. Fahgs of vulnerability, ppowetlessaess and matginaiity in the labour force were major deterrents to any open discussion of one's iiiness. Th& sentiment is in Locping with Yang's (1993) conviction that as a people the Chinese are very practical-minded. However, the stroag feelings of perceived stigma revealed by the inforrnants as the interview pmceeded, suggested that practicality may be the mtionalization that caused them to avoid disdosure of theu problem. They might have felt der with disclosing to the interviewer that they 14 lost their worbg ability, since this would not in anyway jeopardizt their employment or chance of employment. Respondents felt that, culturally, Chinese prefer keeping things to themselves or in the family; this attitude was reflected in their view towards epilepsy, depression and schizophrenia (Appendix H. General Ihess Beliefs, p.306). The rnajocity of hem asserted that patients would keep others fiom knowing that they were infiicted with these ilinesses. This attitude became even morr intense with any suggestion, especially by a physician, that the\u00f9 fatigue might be linked to mental ilinesses. Knowing that Western medicine classifies most illnesses as either physical or psychologid, king denied a concrete physical diagnosis by their physicians left cespondents fceling stigmatized and assuming their physicians might be duding to a psychologicai cause. Tsai and CO-workers (1981) suggest that the fear of stigma and Chinese beliefs, which associate mental illness with the patients and their fdes' failme to meet cultural moral stmdards, may lea\u00e2 patients to avoid seeking help fiom mental health profesSonals. Participants of this study experienced iremendous hstration because they were no longer able to fiuiction at theu former levei due to their CF and weakness. The \"abomination of the body\" (Goffinan, 1963, p.4) Left them feeling helpless and threatened dieu 1iveLibood in today's harsh Canadian economy. People who were closest to them doubted their personal integrity and chamter* hdividuals who, thmughout their lives, bad prided themselves on king more industrious than others were now king labclled as lazy by their love ones. This label rendered them as \"yee lm gee\" Le. second class ci- within their own cube. As a visible minority, Chinnr patients are also susceptible to the \"tnbai stigma of race\" (Gaffmen, 1963, p.4). These 152 CF patients experienced the \"double jeopardy\" of not being accepted by theu own people or by main stream Canadian cultwe. B: Others' knowledge of one's ii\u00efaess would affect one's chance of getting married or one's marriaee In the Chinese culture, the penon is construed as a relational-self, therefore, delegitimation of the person and the family can affect the whole famiiy's chance of marriage (Kleinman et al., 1995). Similar to their opinions towards patients suffering fiom epilepsy, depression and schizophrenia (Appendix H. Geneial Illness Beliefs, p.306), most of the respondents who were married felt that fatigue had an impact on their dage. Those who were single, beiieved that fatigue diminished their chance of getting married. However, the underlying reasons for the perceived negative impact of these ailments differed. They believed that the hereditary and unpredictable nature of epilepsy, the glwmy atmosphere mateci by the presence of a depresscd person, and the potential eruption of violent behaviour associated with xhizophrenia would reduce these patients' chances of getiing IllSillled, or maintainhg a mamage. Fatigue implies the inability to eam a living, while other illnesses, such as epilepsy, depression or schizophrenia put the sufferers and their kinships' integrity and good name in jeopardy. Participants considered themselves to be a burden to their spouses, and felt ashamed of not king able to Mill theu daily responsibilities in theu family. Single informants saw themselves as incapable of taLing on any of the obligations of mamage, thus deeming themselves as excluded hm the marriage pool. These feelings have mots in the Confucan teaching tbat obligations corne with each interpersonai reiationship. \"The whange of obligations is a matter of Coafucian duty and the expression of such duty serves to stabiih the family unit which is the fiamewodr for al1 relationships\" (Reddhg & Wong, 1993, p. 287). Failhg to engage in such an exchange, limits one 153 hm forming new interpersonal relationships ancl, subsequently, one's contribution to the growth of the family . C: Family prefed concealing patient's condition The majority of infonnants indicated that the\u00f9 family preferred strongiy that their condition be concealed, in some cases, more so than the patients. Being denied a diagnosis, and king aware of the dichotomous classification of illnesses as physical or mental in Western medicine, participants lived in constant fear of being labelled mentally ill. They feared that anger would be directed at hem by family members, and they considered themselves to be innocent victims who had to shoulder the burden of stigma They believed that the repugnance of being relateci to a mentaiiy iii person might prompt family members to conceal the patients' illness. This sentiment was echoed in their views towards others who dered hm epilepsy, depnssion and particularly schhphrenia (Appendix H. General Illness Beliefs, p.306). in their description of the complex dynamics of shame and guilt in the families of mentally il1 Chinese patients, Lin, T. and Lin, M. (198 1) alleged that the stigrna attached to mental illness may have originated hm the fdly's fear of expure to criticism and disgrace. Since mental illness \"implies character flaws in an ancestor and thus shame is imputed to the whole family\" (Puchett, 1993, p.3 11), it carries a particular stigma arnongst Chinese both in China and in immigrant cornmunities in Western societies (Chan, F. et ai., 1988; Pearson & Phillips, 1994). Lacking a concrete physiologid diagnosis, participants of this study wen sensitive to any suggestion that they may be suBering hm mental illness to avoid implicating their fam\u00fcy members. The idea of keeping tbgs in the fdy has stmng ties to 'face-work\" in the Chinese culture. Face-work is a '%ontstage behaviour\" which one deiibetately @omis in hnt of those one's fay - the basic socid mit; \"backstage bebavioin'' is the \u00fbue behaviour which one can meai only to thme within the My unit @and & Hwmg, 1993). Gofbm (1955) defines \"fiace\" 154 as \"the positive social value a person effectively claims for hunsclf by the line others assume he has taken during a particular contact. Face is an image of self delineated in tenns of approved social attribute\" (p. 213). One loses face as a result of one's inability to measure up to expectations in social performance. Loss or gain of face is based on sets of cnteria or standards which Vary both cross-cultumlly and over the within a single culture (Ho, 1976). Redding and Wong (1994) purport that aithough face is a hurnan universal, the degree of concem is much greater for the Chinese than for othets. For the Chinese, face (or lien in Chinese) is moral worh and contains the idea of king a decent person; losing f\u00e0ce is a serious matter which potentially affects one's ability to bction effectively in society (Ho, 1976). For informants who hoped to attain a much better fiiture for themselves and their children by migration, falling short of expectations established by the\u00f9 community le\u00eet them feeling as if they had lost face, as they were no longer able to achieve their career goals or attain a better standard of living for their families. D: Feeling rrshamed and inferior As Scheper-Hughes and Lock (1986) note, the social production of stigma creates a second diction in addition to the original condition. in this regard, suffiering of the CF patients was intensified by not ody thinking les of themselves because of the deterioration of thek level of fiuictioning, but also by the perception that they were despised by others. They felt shame and lost 'Yace.\" The majority of nspondents also indicated ihat people who suffered hm epilepsy, depression and schimphrenia wouid feel asbed if others knew of theu illnesses, because, in the Chinese culture, anything tk is les than favourabie ceflects badly not just on the individual, but on the family (Appendur H. Ged mess Beliefs, p.306). Rooted in Confcucianism, Chinese culture bas been describecl as shame orienteci (Chu, 1973). Thmugh Confucianism's emphasis on social nom and refaeoa to ideals as rnodels of behaviout, shame is defined in ttm~~ of an interpersonai orientation in which behaviom are compared to social ideals. Confucian teaching places special emphasis on had work and disapprovd of idleness. The particular circumstances of life, especially the surroundhg elements of Utlfamiliarity and Uisecunty that affect immigrants, lead to the development of a strong work ethic (Redding & Wong, 1993). Being regarded as \"lazy\" renders one vulnerable to rejection by the social network. Therefore, there is a strong tendency to conform to the gened ethics of hard work amongst overseas Chinese, such as par\u00eeicipants of this study. It seemed that informants felt that it was \"normal\" for othets to despise them as lay if they were not working hard, in spite of the fact that they might have a health-related reason for this perceived laziness. Ever since becoming ill, some (7) informants felt that even relatives they had helped in the past started to avoid them and excluded them hm social activities. They resented this avoidance, perhaps because of their unfWUed expectation of jen (benevolence) or munial support and reciprocity of favours (renqing). Jen, a centrai Confucian rnaxim, is considered as one of the most central virtues of the Chinese people (King & Bond, 1985). Being avoided by someone who owes one a renqing intensifies this fecling of losing fi and king stigmatized. E: Fear of negative effects on the famiiy Kleinman and colleagues (1995) contend that in the West, stigma is a personal moral category but that in the Chinese context moral blame extends to the entire family. Patients in ihis study concd with Kleinman and colleagues' (1 995) view that stigma associated with their ilhess is not \u00fcmited to themselves but extends to their families. Informants were concemed that others would look down on them and the\u00f9 families as a redt of their ilInesses. In concert with Goffinen's (1963) idea of shared stigma, participants who were Living with or close to the\u00f9 parents were concemed about their parents' feelings of self doubt, anger and embarrassrnent They believed thek parrnts condermicd themselves for aot nilnliing theh mspoosibility to 156 their kinship and ancestors, because they failed to bring up industrious descendants. Respondents who are parents were fnistrated in their inability to set a good example as hard working people for their children. This way of thinking is in keeping with the family or social orientation of the Chinese (Yang, 1993). Comparing Americans and Chinese, Yang (1993) argues that instead of king trained to hction independently of the family netwock, the Chinese are brought up to nmain an integrai part of their families throughout the\u00f9 lives. A self orientation in the West is more common than a Chinese social orientation. Confucian teaching dictates that the family rather than the individuai is the basic unit of society, the individual's actions are not his own and are in fact considered to be representative of the famiiy, past, present and firture (Hsu, J-y 1985). Thus, honour or stigma is not an individual but rather a fbly matter. A person's face cm be lost or gained as a result of the behaviour of someone to whom he is closely related, even that of one's ancestors. An individual's face and the good name of his family (chia sheng) are inseparable in traditional Chinese society. A son's misconduct is often taken to be a refiection of his father's failure to educate the younger generation propetly. Both fathci and son are guilty of not fullilling filial piety in having brought disgrace to the family and hence to the anceston (Ho, 1976). The lack of a medical diagwsis was interpreted by some as suggesting mental illness. The family with a mentally il1 member is onen excluded fiom the marital pool (Kleinman, 1977; Lin, K. M., 1981; Sue & Morishima, 1982). This fear was well depicted in respondents' opinions towards family members of patients with epilepsy and schizophrenia, where close to half of them stated that it would be ditncult for relatives of these patients to marry. Why 66% of the participants claimed that depression would not pose a problem for the sufferer's relatives is not clear and requires Mer investigation (Appeadix H. Geaasl IIlii#is Beliefs, p.306). Ovcrview of Findings Avoiding people and keeping to themselves, attributing theu illness to fate, and normalization were coping strategies employed to combat stigma. These strategies, especially norxnalization, were considered useful in maintaining employment Discussion of Findians Infonnants utilized mauily selfirected strategies to cope with their perceived stigma. The Confician tradition of self-discipline may have an influence on the tendency to resort to oneself, rather than seek help hm others in times of distress (Cheung, F., L993). Striving for normalcy seemed to be the oniy strategy that would help the patients to keep their jobs. This is similar to Gofian's (1963) suggestion that to avoid stigma is \"to pass\" (p. 9), that is, to pretend one is normal. Yang (1993) suggests that, in general, Chinese identify themselves with the expectations of the society or groups to which they belong. They uphold social nom to avoid feelings of shame aad Nt, and the threat of group ostracism against those who deviate hm nom. Norrnalization might have a\u00fcowed informants to maintain the Chinese social nom of king hard working and able to maintain hamonious relationships, which in turn, may have minimivd their feelings of shame and gui1 t . Perceived Cause Overview of Findinas Participants varied widely in how they interpceted their ihess. However, they aii went through a sim\u00fcar process of assimg causes ot hding meanings behind their iliness. This pnness circmces leading up to theu fhtigue, cira. on 158 their past illness experiences and health beliefs, and subsequeatly conjuring up a wide range of explanations and causes for theu CF. Several themes evolved from narratives of the respondents. As each interview progressed, it became clear that macro forces, such as the political uncertainty in their homeland and the economic downtum of their newly adopted country, converged to affect individual lives. A common theme was the impact of migration which uprooted them fiom their heritage, society, and lifestyle. Fatigue was viewed by some as the resdt of stress induced by life changes brought on by migration. Not unlike their Caucasian counterparts in other CF research, participants of the cunent study held multiple explanations sirndtaneously and without an apparent feeling of contradiction, Social problems, such as lack of social support, interpersonal conflicts, fmcial difficulties resulting fiom lack of employment oppomuiities, and racism were alleged by most participants to be the major causes of their illness. Many of them believed that their fatigue was caused by exhaution resulting hm overwork, the rnajonty (58%) of whom were sedentary workers not accustomed to physical labour. Out of necessity (such as having to meet living expenses and provide financial support to family members in their home countries) and because of their limited English proficiency, they were forced to take on low-level service and factory jobs ofkn incongruent with their pre-migration work experience and education. ilifferences in culture, language, social milieu, and value system between their native and adopted homelands became visual tnggers which evoked fcelings of nostalgia and loss, drawing the inte~ewees into an oscillaiing pattern between past memories of joyful moments and moumfiil junctures and the present Many also blamed their personality for not king able to let go and get on with their new lives in Canada. 159 Those who cited a medical or physical cause for the\u00f9 illness, said they learned about it hm the mass media. Most of the patients who fnuned their perceived causes in traditional Chinese medicine concepts and their alleged negligence with regard to cultural health practices, fomulated these concepts by paying attention to their own bodily sensations and by consulting knowledgeable people in traditional Chinese medicine. lnheriting a weak body or king deprived of nutrition since birth were cited as congenital or hereditary factors that had contributed to the\u00f9 fatigue. Being bewitched by supernaturai forces and punished for bad deeds committed in one's previous Life were considered to be causes beyond one's control. Those who reported environmental hypersensitivity as a cause had ken exposed to adverse chernicals. The following themes were identified fiom the narratives: (A) Social factors as the most significant perceived cause. (B) Overwork and adjustment to physically demanding work exhaust one's body, (C) Psychological factors contribute to fatigue, @) Medical and physical causes - leaming the cause fiom the mass media, (E) Traditional and culturai explanations - one's body in disharmoriy. (F) Coagenital or hereditary factors - getting the iliness fkom b\u00fcth, (O) Magical and supernatwal forces that are beyond one's control, (H) Being expose\u00e2 to environmental pollution. Discussion of Findings \"Meaning and knowledge are aiways in reference to a world constituted in human experience, fordated and apprehended through symbolic forms and distinctive interpretative practices. (Good, 1994, p. 177) In this way, infotmants' perceiveci auses of their iiiness wnc cultural tams. Like thek counteprts in Yu's (1994) study, 160 participants in the cmnt study cited multiple causes for their iliness without apparent feeling of contradiction. Kimiayer, Young, & Robbins (1994) hold that non-westem cultures seem to allow people to hold quite disparate or logically inconsistent views about different domains of knowledge and belief without insisting that they be reconciled. Pluralism has always been commonplace in Chinese perspectives on illness (Kleinrnan, 1980), so the multiple causes perceived by the informants is in concert with their culture. A substantial proportion (34%) of the informants of this study ascribed the most important cause of their illness to social issues, such as family conflicts and workplace discrimination. Physical (10%) and psychological (10%) causes played much lesser roles. This is in contrat to their counterparts in Yu's (1994) study, in which 50% ascribed their illness to a physical cause, 32 % identified a psychological cause and 18% to an interpersonal or social reason. Yu's (1994) subjects were out-patients of a government hded hospital where tiee medical care was provided; these patients were mainly fiom a lower socio-econornic neighbourhood and were less educated than the general population in Hong Kong. Perhaps, it would be considered inappropriate for this group of patients to present their problerns in anything but physicai terms in a charitable medical care facility. In the present study, physical illness might have been discounted since al1 passed ihrough a thorough medical examination in order to corne to Canada, and no medical cause had ken found for their fatigue. Participants in the cumnt study were al1 Unmigrants and thus had to contend with issues related to migration on a daily basis. Identifyllig social difticulties as the causes of their fatigue might seem to be Iogical and acceptable in this conte* Furthemore, unl\u00fcce Yu's (1994) subjects who were less educated than the Hong Kong general public, most of the intonnants of the cumnt study had a pst secondary education which allowed them a much wida use of words to present their opinions. Cheung, F. (1985) maintairu that aithough t&ere is an abunriruice of words 161 illustrathg abstract feelings in the Chinese language, affect is mostly expressed in somatic ternis. Therefore, people who are less educated do not have access to the vocabularies needed to express their views. A detemination of whether the differences in these fhdings are due to the nature of the place of treatment or educational level are beyond the scope of this study. Research with a matched sample wouid allow the exploration of the influence of these variables. A: Social factors as the most sinnlficant perceived cause Research in CF has shown that patients (predominately Caucasians of Western culture) are inclined to seek a physical cause for illness, even when supportive evidence cannot be found by their physicians. They also tend to resist a psychological explanation for illness (Clements et al., 1997; David et al., 1990; Kirk et al., 1990; Lane et al., 1991; Nelson et al., 1987; Ray et al., 1992; YU, 1994). Ware (1992, 1993) reported that even for those patients who favoured a psychosocial cause of their fatigue, they hned it as \"biopsychosocial\" involving the immune system king weakened by stress and resulting in a viral infection that produced the syrnptoms of CFS. Uniike their counterparts in the larger culture, Chinese patients in this study at\u00eeributed their illness to the impact of migration which precipitated contextual difficulties in their Unmediate social environment These ditncuities included: unemployment and uaderemployment, perceived racisrn and lack of acceptance by the larger society, familial and inter-generational conflicts and unable to Wy participate in the larger Canadian society due to limited English proficiency. Although 64% of the respondents also at\u00fbibured social problems to be a cause of schuopbfenia (Appendix H. General ilJness Beiief, p.306), losses brought about schizopbrmia, while tenacious pcrpdual obstacles, 162 such as those contextual difficulties they had encountered, caused their fatigue. Similar difficulties had also been reported to have a negative effect on the psychological well king of immigrants (Canadian Task Force on Mental Health Issues Affecting Immigrants and Refugees, 1988b; Fumham & Li, 1993; Wong, 1997). As new immigrants end visible miwrity group members, participants in this study shace these problems with their fellow newcomers. Four sub-themes: (a) coping with the challenges of an 'astronaut\" family, (b) difficulties encountered in interpersonal and familiai relationships after migration, (c) coming to ternis with underemployment or unemployrnent, and (d) king victimized by racial discrimination especiaiiy at the workplace. are among the themes of social context. a: Coping with the challenges of an uastronaut* famiii Higher earnings and employment status in their place of ongin enabled those men who retunied to their place of origin to Mfil their obligations to maintain a comparable living standard for their families in Canada and their own social status, and to minimize the losses incuned due to immigration to Canada. With the departure of these spouses, bbastronaut families\" wece mated, and changes were brought to the family power structure with women willing or unwillingly king subjected to major transformations in their traditional roles. For the first time in their Iives, many female Uiformants had to make decisions for themselves and their families in the absence of theu husbands who were working overseas. Some had a taste of Western freedom by eaming a pay cheque but stiU had to live within cultural pmtocols that dictated that childcare and housework were her respomibiiities. The Caaedian Western cdture that encourages autoaomy and individuaiism is in direct contrast to the coUectivist culture of the Chinese. Culhues with a collective or interdependent concept of the person may give Iess importance to intemai psychologid &tors in explainhg 163 events, emphasizing instead their social circumstances (Triandis, 1995). The uneven pace of acculturation of members of the same family became apparent, leading to fdly conflicts and disruptions that most informants had never anticipated prior to their migration. b: Ditneulties encountered in interpersonai and frimiliai datio~~hips PPter migration Social discord has been found to be common amongst CF patients. Komaroff and Buchwald (199 1) reported that 33% of the American CFS patients they studied had strained relationships with famiiy, friends, and CO-workers. The majority of the Chinese neurasthenic patients in Kleinman & Kleinman's (1982, 1985) study also indirectly attributed their illness to strained relationships in the family and the workplace. Like their counterparts in Kleinman ad Kleinman's (1982, 1985) study, participants in this study perceived the major cause of their fatigue as difficulties in interpersonal codicts and problems resulting fiom their immigration to Canada. Fabrega (1 99 1) supposes that in traditional Chinese medicine there is no ontological notion of disease. Diagnosis of illness is based on symptom clusten or syndromes that reflect imbalances in bodily systems that are also digned with aspects of larger social and ecological systems. The holism of Chinese medicine does not develop psychology as a separate realm of discourse. Instead, in confomlity with the Confucian ethos, attention is paid to dishannony in relationships as a potent cause of illness. As Kleinman (1988) aiggests, cultural values and social relations shape the experience of the body and iiiness and situate suffiering in local mord worlds. Therefore. there are culturai and social reasons for infocmants to fiame their derings ami social ~cuities in culnual and social terms. Most of the infoinrants were under the age of 50, had a pst secondary educa\u00eeion, immigrateci to Cauada at the prime of theu iives, ad bad pmrnising aimer opportunities prior to 164 migration. However, at the time of theu interview, almost half (46%) of them were unemployed. Those who were fortunate enough to be employed oflen experience a significant downward shifi in occupational status in Canada. This is in keeping with the findings of a community survey of 547 Chinese male immigrants fiom Southeast Asia, which indicated that underemployrnent and unemployment were major pmblems (Wong, 1997). With informants' deteriorathg energy levels, they expenenced increasing difficulties in obtaining and keeping unskilled jobs, which were also disappearing from the Canadian economy. CF patients in the larger society also expenence disruptions in employment; Yeomans and Conway (1991) reported that only 13% of their subjects were able to maintain full-time employment, and 47% became unernployed because of CFS- Given that the poverty line is a monthly personal income of $1367.00 (Statistics Canada, 1996), the majority of (38 or 76%) of respondents was living in poverty. Financial pressures created a significant level of distress for these patients. CF patients in the larger society sirnilarly experience financial constraints. In a descriptive study of 1 10 CFS patients in the US, Anderson and Ferrans (1997) reported that marriages became strained because of inability to work. A fair number (27%) also indicated that they had no economic choice but to push themselves to work despite wocsening symptoms. They were particularly concerned about the\u00f9 long-tenn financial needs given that most were in their prime wage-earning years. uistead of building a future, they were expending their savings (Anderson & Ferrans, 1997). For participants in this study, the stress associated with feiling to land a job cornmensurate with the position or social status held previously in the home country, and coping with dwindling financial ceserves was dleged to be a major cause of fatigue. With its ment system, the Ceriadian immigration policy encourages professionals to immigrate to Canada, and many weii edwated and sk\u00fcied people psiticuhdy hm Third Wodd 165 countries are attracted to corne. Unforaioately, most of these immigrants are not fully infonned that stringent requirements may disqualify theu credentials, and they will not be petmitted to practise their professions in Canada (Basran & Zong, 1998). The Access Report (1989) by the Ontario Government concludes that unfair and arbitrary barriers to employment for immigrants are significant. These barriers stem mainly fkom immigrants' academic credentids and their work experience king devalued or simply not recognized by Canadian employers. Other migrants also share this predicament. Relating experiences of Australian immigrants of Chinese and Indian backgrounds, Rogler (1994) notes that institutional and bureaucratic barriers often keep them from exercising their professional qualifications. They are oftea occupationaliy downgraded and must undertake employment that is qualitatively below what they have been educated to do. d. Beim vi- by rodai discrimination Though moa of the respondents were gratefbl for king spared the strains of political uncerta\u00eenty by migrating to Canada, most still regarded themselves as outsiders struggling for a sense of belonging in their adopted homeland. Multicuihualism is a Canadian invention, a new phenomena to most newcomers fiom homogenous cultures. In fact, Canadians actuaily have the most experience in the world with this concept. However, one of the major adjustments of the participants was dealing with racial prejudice and discrimination. The expecience of becorning a member of a minority instead of a part of the majocity in one's homeland was threatening. Despite \"howing the odds\" prior to theu depamire, miel prejudice and overt discrimination created distresshg and disorienting experiences, shed by their Latino couterparts in the US (Esph, 1981). Since their families' on theu employment incorne, respondents' distnss acute when they were involved in inter-racial conf\u00eeicts at the workpiace. The stress was 166 intensified by the knowledge that they did not have the liberty to resign or nsk dismissal if they filed a compla.int. Most male informants saered a lost of status and a feeling of no longer king in charge. Men who had prestigious professional positions in their homeland found themselves doing menial work and became dependent on employed wives to support them and the family. They became burdens on their spouses who dready were under tremendous stress from coping with a new culture, particularly in the workplace. The fact that Chinese immigrants in Westem nations are racially visible and cannot bled in as easily as Caucasian immigrants fiom Europe places them in a special category of immigrants who are more apt to experience discrimination and feelings of king different. In addition, their traditional Chinese culture diverges in many ways fiom the Westem cultures of their host societies. a factor which may create intense challenges to their acculturation into Canadian society . Separation from loved ones, interpersonal contlicts, racial discrimination, and under- or unemployment, were life strallis considered by the participants to be primary causes of their CF and weakness, bypassing the psychological or emotional responses to these stresses. Life strains have also been reported by others as associated with the onset of CF. Dobbins and CO-worken (1995) conducted a case-control study of 20 CFS patients and 20 matched controls (predominantly white middle-aged, fernale) and found that patients with CFS repurted significantly more stressful Ise events, in the 5 years pior to the onset of their illness, than the\u00f9 controls. These events included job (80% vs. 30%) and health problems (45% vs. SN), and death of a love one (45% vs. 15%). There are sirnilatities in the stressfiil iife events reportai by Dobbins and CO-workers' (1995) subjects aad informants of the cumnt study. The nature of events was very much a tef\u00eecction of the social aad contextual chumstances of these patients. B: Ovemork and aausbnent to pbysidy demandina work exhaust one's body Participants expanded their definition of long-held Confician maxims on status, success, honour and shame by passing al1 their hopes and dreams for a better life on to theu children. They swailowed their pide and took on much lower status and labonous jobs to support themselves and their families. They (88%) blamed overwork, especially physically exfiausting work as a major cause of their fatigue. In traditional Chinese medicine, overwork cm lead to the deficiency of blood which results in fatigue (Zhang, E., 1991). \"When the force of Yang is exhausted under the pressure of overwork and weariness, then the essence (of the body) is cut short, the openings of the body are obstnicted and the secretions are retained. This causes sickness in the summer and distress\" (Veith, 1972, pp. 106-107) [Cited in Wu, 19821. factors contribute to fatigue In Clements and colleagues' (1997) qualitative study of 66 CF patients, they found that these patients tended to attribute the cause of their illness as physical or stress-related and to avoid labelling it as psychogenic. This may be because a psychological cause may raise doubts about both the reality of the illness and the chanicter of the suf6erer. This is in concert with Ware's (1992) view that mordistic prejudices imply that a personal weakness or Uiferiority is present in the sufferer of illnesses that are psychological. Contrary to Clements and colleagues' (1997) and Ware's (1992) reports, a substantid number of uifofmants in this study considered psychologid factors as one of the causes of their fatigue. Traditional Chinese medicine asserto that deficiency of blood leads to fatigue, as a result of \"over thinking\" and worrying (Zhang, 1991, p.328); nspondents felt that since they had kea wo-g and constantly thinking about their future, htigue would be expected to rdt. The ubiquity of grieving for the past and the stress of coping with pnscnt ckums\u00eeances dt in a 168 feeling of helplessaess and hopelessness, because they felt that they could not return to their place of origin or succeed in Canada. A positive association between migration and psychiatric disorder bas been reported as early as the 1930's (Odegaard, 1932) [cited in Shepherd, Cooper, Brown, & Kalton, 198 11. Even though, none of the participants were diagnosed with a psychia\u00fbic disorder, with the stress of immigration, they may be at higher risk than their non-migrant counterparts. D: Meciid and pbysifPl causes - leorning the cause from the mm media The majority of informants were told by the\u00f9 physicians that their illness did not have a medical or physical cause. Those who cited a medical or physical cause, claimed to have learned it hm the mas media. This is contrary to findings of most CF research in which most of their subjects (predominmtly white and Amencan) at\u00fcibuted a physical cause to their CF (Clements et al., 1997; David et al., 1990; Kirk et al., 1990; Lane et al., 1991; Nelson et al., 1987; Ray et al., 1992). Even in Yu's (1994) study, the majority of her Chinese patients also ascribed their iljness to a physical cause. Holding a belief that the ihess is due to a physical cause is strongly associated with poor prognosis (Joyce, Hotopf, & Wessely, 1997; Wessely, 1994). With physical cause playing a minor role, participants might have a much better chance of improvement than their counterparts in other studies. A longitudinal study, which allows the monitoring of the patient's illness expenence ovenime, couid shed some \u00fcght on the relationship between prognosis and perceived causes for this group of patients. E: Traditionai and cultural expianatio~~~ - one's body in dishamony Gd (1994) states that people reason about illness, and that culaire provides the logic of that nasoning. In congruence with traditionai Chhese medical concepts, informants asctibed their fatigue to the imbaiance of the En and Yong forces. One of the major symptoms, as weli as 169 perceived causes of their fatigue, was difficulty in their sleeping pattern. According to traditional Chinese medicine, somnolence is often seen arnongst patients who are deficient in the Yang force, while insomnia is common amongst those who lack blood in the heart (not to be interpreted literally), who are over-womed, have deficiency of qi in both the heart and spleen and imbalance of \"heart fue\" and \"kidney water\" (Kaptchuk, 1983; Yam, 1997). Some female participants blamed their CF and weakness on their failure to follow cultural health protocols der childbirth years ago. W ithin the context of traditionai Chinese medical theory, pregnancy and childbirth leave the woman in a state of imbaiance much like that of an illness. Since a woman's joints are considercd to be \"opened up\" after giving bW, she faces the danger of cold wind entering her joints creating weakness and pains. The postpartum period is considerd dangerous because the woman is in a state of an excess of yin force (Pillsbury, 1978). According to traditional Chinese cultural health protocol, al1 women are required to be confined to the house for one month afkr childbirth, with a speciaily balanced diet and modified puerperd behaviour. She must avoid cold fds, cold winds, and cold water. This is cd1 \"tua yeuti\" or \"sitting in\" for the month. (Cheung, N., 1997). Ways to remedy the situation are either to have another birth to correct the imbalance by doing another tuo yewi the correct way, or to take proper Chinese herbal medicine to regain balance. Since most of the female participants who cited childbirth as a cause, felt that they wen either too old or could not af5ord to have another child, they pursued traditional Chinese medical help instead. F: Congeaita1 or that their parents were 'sickly\" when they were growing up, and tbey thought that ihey might have inhr\u00eeted a weak body hm their parents. However, they were carefiil mt to lay the biame on th& parents dircctly. because of nliPI stigma to the LinShip. Coafiu:ian teadhg -tes that bodies, skin ad hiir corn 170 from our ancestors\" (Qui, 1988). Should they have labelled the\u00f9 illness as a hereditary one, they would risk dishonotuhg or stigmatizing their kinship. This sentiment was reflected when their opinions about the cause of epilepsy were sought (Appendix H. General Illness Beliefs, p.306). The rmjority (66%) of the respondents of this study did not hesitate to allege hereditary (58%) and congenital (8%) factors as primary causes of the illness. This may be because heredity as a cause of epilepsy is well accepted within the Chinese culture. Since they were noi victims of ep\u00fcepsy, attributhg heredity as a cause of epilepsy would not implicate hem or their family members. Furthemore, epiiepsy is a more visible illness than CF and, therefore, more dificuit to disguise. G: Magicai and supernaturd forces that are beyond one's control Participants' narratives demonstrated that theu views included selected beliefs and practices fiom different philosophies and religions. Many of the practices associated with the various philosophical doctrines were intricately woven into the fabric of their lives. Some participants who claimed to be devoted Christians would adopt a cause proposed by Taoist priests that they were aficted by restless spirits, while others blamed badfeng shui as the cause. Supernaturd forces seem to play an important role in the Chinese psyche. Phillips and CO- workers (1993) fouad that Chinese died aimost 5 years earlier than White Americaas if they had a combination of disease and birth year which Chwse astrology and medicine deemed ili-fated. Chinese astrology and medicine consider a person's fate as inauenced by hidher year of birth. Bud\u00e2hist teaching regards dering as the direct effect of bad deed(s) comniitted either in one's past, or in a previous liEr or lives or by one's ancestors (Qui, 1991). Participants who were Buddhist resigned themselves to fate, and that their action with fatigue was the resuit of bad deeds. Some respondents speculated that their CF and weakness were relatai to their exposure to envuonmentai pollution, such as inhalation of allergens or From sick building syndrome. They acknowledged that they learned these tenns from the mass media. They compared the symptoms described in the mass media with those they were experiencing, then came to the conclusion that hypersensitivity to environmental pollution might be one of the causes of their illness. Envuonmental hypersensitivity refers to a chronic debilitating condition that results fiom inability to tolerate various foods and environmentai substances. The existence of such a condition is dismissed by most in the medical profession (Government of Ontario, 1985). and some equate it with somatization (Stewart & Raskin, 1986; Stewart, 1987). Participants who solicited consensus for such a cause hm their physicians felt ndiculed as none of their phy sicians accepted it as a cause of illness. Help-Seeking Behaviour \"Ilinesses arc experiences of devalued changes in states of king and in social fuaction; diseases, in the scientific paradigm of modem medicine, are abnonnalities in the structure and hction of body organs and systems\" (Eisenberg, 1977). In the\u00fb pursuit of a cure, respondents were stniggling to accept the judgement of their physicians that they were not confionted by an acute disease, but rather a chronic illness. Unfortunately, despite extensive re-h the= is no defiative diagnostic test or effective treatment for CF; interventions are only directed at the relief of symptoms and maintenance of the patient's level of fiinctioning (Buchwaid, 1996; Wesseiy et al., 1995). It was the illdefined natute of their iiiness that Id most of the participants into their long and dincuit joumey of helpseeking. 172 Findings nom this study show that participants utilized the three social arenas of the health care systems: popdar, professional and folk concurrently (Kieinman, 1978). However, there was limited flow of information about individuai patients fiom one health practitioaer to another (except those between the family doctor and the ceferring specialist in Western medicine). Thus, patients started afiesh each time they presented their health history to a new health practitioner. Similar to their place of origin, in Toronto's Chinatowns practitioners of both Westem and traditional Chinese medicines practice side-by-side. These services were utilized concunently by participants without any feelings of contradiction, because both treatment modalities were perceived as providing unique and complementary care. This finding is consistent with previous studies conducted in China (Kleinman, 1 WO), Hong Kong (Cheung, F., 1989) and other Chinese immigrant communities (Lee, L., 1992), that Chinese tend to employ a pluralistic approach to health cace, in particular, utilizing Westem and traditional Ciiimse medicines simultaneously. Ovcrview of Findings In terms of a cure, most participants had very Iow expectations of their family doctors. They expressed their gratitude to this group of caregivers for their willingness to listen and for the on- going monitoring of their conditions. Almost al! infonnants considered traditional Chinese medicine practitioners as their only hope of getting to the root of their iliness, they were deterred by the expenses incumd by their treatments. Respondents preferred Westem physicians of Chinese background, tnisting that they would share their cultural heaith beliefs. However, since these heaith can professiods were educated in the Westem biomedical model, most did not share their explanatory models or expectations of treatment in relation to their health beliefs. Some physicians admitted to theV lack of kmwledge of traditional Chinese hdih beliefs wh\u00fce others dismissed the patient's questions, duchg them to feeling ignorant and oid-Woned. Al1 participants engaged in some degree of self-help. They paced themselves, exercised and kept themselves infonned by reading literature related to their illness, and tumed to hily and friends for help. Some resorted to supernaaual sources for help to achieve a peace of mind. A minority of participants saw mental health worken reluctantly in fear of the potential stigma associated with being diagnosed as mentally ill. The following are major themes identified fiom the interviews: (A) Effective or not. fam\u00fcy doctors have done theu best to help, (B) Traditional Chinese dicine may be effective but is too expensive as an ongoing treatment, (C) Westem medicine cannot get to the roots of the problem, (D) Self-help works sometimes; fam\u00fcy and fnends can be helphil if they accept there is an illness, (E) For peace of mind, seek help from supernaturd sources, (F) Mental health practitioaers - can they help? Discussion of Fiam A: Effdve or not, famiiy dodors have done their best to help Family physicians and other practitionen of Western medicine constitute the professional arena of the health care system (Kleinman, 1980). Participants seemed to be motivated by two major concem as they accessed services fiom this arena. First, they sought help in order to find a solution to theu pmblem and hoped diat a diagnosis would lea\u00e2 to an effective treatment* Secondly, they hoped diat their distress would be socially validated and made compmhensible in some way, both for themselves and others. When asked the kinds of help they would suggest for victims of epilepsy, the majority of informants also cecommended that due to the unprrdictable nanue of epiiepsy Generai Illiiess Beliefs, p.306) the patients. should consuit 174 family doctors so that they would benefit fiom being diagnosed using sophisticated Westem medical technology. Since its introduction to the Chinese at the turn of the century, Westem medicine has become their new standard of truth. It has transformed the subjective exper\u00efence of illness into visible anatomic lesions or shadows on x-ray fihs and scans, and numben in laboratory reports. A diagnosis given by a Westem medicine practitioner enables patients to make clear to others that they have a genuine medical problem and provides a name that they can use to organize the mechanism and explanation of their distress. However, much of the practice of Westem medicine to date, such as highly sophisticated diagnostic technology, seems to be dnven by unrealistic efforts to eliminate uncertainty and to maintain control, although this way, on occasion, be mereiy illusory. It has also created unrealistic expectations and set the stage for subsequent blarne and cesentment (Quill & Suchman, 1993). General practitioners are the entry points to the professional arena of the Ontario health care system. The general practitioners who were designated by the infonnants as their family doctors were not the only general practitioner they consuitcd for their illness. Nevertheless, they were the ones with whom the patients had the longest affiliation and highest satisfaction. In general, family doctors have the advantage of direct access to the medical history and social background of their patients. OAen their assessrnent is based on professional contact with the patient extendhg back over a protracted penod (Shepherd, Cooper, Brown, & Kalton, 1981). Denz-Penhey and Murdoch (1993) surveyed 83 genera\u00ee practitioners in New Zealand and found that 90.2% of those sweyed accepteci CFS as a vaiid diagnosis. These researchers concludeci that the controversy of CFS as a vaiid diagnosis hPs receded among this group of physic\u00eeans. This nading is in direct contrast to the pract\u00efce of the reftzriag physicians of this study. Aithough al1 participants met the selection criteria for this study, only 2 were diagnosed with CFS and most were not given this diagnosis by their physicians. Most of the Uiformants were pleased with their family doctor's care. This is in con\u00fbast to a report in which 92% (N=397) of the patients in general medicine were satisfied with their physician, while only 75% (N=609) of patients with CFS expressed general satisfaction with their medical care. CF patients who expected a cure fkom theu doctor were more dissatisfied, since they were not king cured (Twemlow, Bradshaw, Coyne, & Lerma, 1997). Ward and co- workers (1 996), based on their chart review of 425 primary care patients who cornplaincd of CF, found that physiciaus were lax in mental and physical examinations, history taking and ordering laboratory tests, and oniy 9.9% mentioned CF in the patients' health records. These researchers concluded that because of the non-specific natwe of CF, practitioners did not focus on this cornplaint, and documentation for CF was ofken incomplete or absent. Many infornianis resented the hesitation their family docton demonstrated in ceferring hem to other physicians. This is in keeping with other research hdings that general practitioners manage 98% of patients who present with fatigue, and refer less than 2% to specialists (Ridsdale, Evans, Jerrett, Mandalia, Osler, Respoadents felt that their physicim were particuiarly cautious about a referral to a psychiatnst. This observation concurs with findings reported by Shepherd and colleagues (1981). In cornparhg two separate randorn sarnples of 149 and 75 British family doctors, these nsearchers discovered that the most fkquently cited reason for not ceferring patients to a psychiatrist was the stigma associated with mental illness. The objection mised by the patient or hidher famiiy may tum on an unwillingness to accept the suggestion that a psychiatrist should see himlhet. Furthemore, the family doctor may refirain hm making the refed anticii>ating the patient's refusal, and hidm belief \u00eehat the stigma 176 resulting nom seeing a psychiatrist may be detrimental to the patient (Shepherd, Cooper, Brown, Kalton, 198 1). Physicians' hesitancy in refemng CF patients to mental health professionals may be justified by findings of a qualitative study conducted by Ax and CO-workers (1997) with 2 samples of 9 (one with 6 femdes and another 8 fernales) patients suffering from CFS. These researchers found that psychological or psychiatrie referrals were unwelcome by these patients, even though most (16) felt unsupported by their family doctoa. Lack of information and emotiod support from their physicians was given as the reason for opting for alternative treatment by these subjects. informants were particularly resentful about their physicians' continuous reassurance that they were in good health, while they were suffe~g fiom multiple symptoms. To \"put pressure on people to think positively and to inhibit manifestations of their distress is self senring on the part of health professionals who deal with ouffering.\" (Lazanis, 1983, p. 132) Asking patients to look at the bright side offered linle consolation to them as they continued to search for meaning for their illness. Hence, they sought help fiom other sources, and they felt a need to exhaust every possible avenue to rem their hope for a cure. Despite a sense of skepticism regarding the care they received, al1 patients appreciated words of encouragement and concem fiom their family docton, as these behaviours hplied care and concern for their well king. B: Traditional Chinese meclidne may k effdve but is too exmuive as an onadap trezitment OAen it is suggested that physiciaas of Western medicine treat acute ilinesses, whiie patients with chronic \u00fcIncsses for which Western tnstment has f'a\u00efied go to traditionai hakn (Lock, 1980). Traditionai Chinese medicine Iogically was the most ut\u00fcized altemative medicine 177 by the participants. In spite of its inceashg popdarity in the larger Canadian society, traditional Chinese medicine is essentiaiiy confined to the Chinese Canadian community. This is due to its practitioners' lack of English proficiency and a theoretical base that is largely foreign to those who are non-Chinese. Therefore, even though traditional Chinese rnedicine as it is practised in mainland China fits Klehan's (1980) description of the professionai arena of the health care system, it cm only be considered as a part of the folk arena in Canada. Most respondents sought help fiom traditional Chinese medicine practitioners because they feel more cornfortable with caregivers who understand thek beliefs and speak their language of health. In other words, because traditional Chinese medicine theories and methods are closely linked to the Chinese common culture, pmtitioners can take into account the whole person, not simply the diseased organ of the body which is the focus of their Western medicine couaterparts. Moreover, being first generation immigrants themselves, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are able to relate to this group of patients fiom a personal perspective. Lack of information and emotional support fiom their physicians has been cited as a reason for opting for alternative treatment by CF patients in the larger culture (Ax et al., 1997). Unregdated traditional Chinese medicine is considered one type of unconventional medicine in Canada, dong with naturopathy and ammatic therapy. Eisenberg and CO-workers (1993) conducted a nationai swey of 1539 aduits to explore the utilization of unconventional medicine in the US. They discovered that 34% of theu respondents used unconventional therapy, most of them non-Blacks age 25 to 49, with above nationai average ducation and incorne. For those with senous medical conditions, 83% aiso sought treatment hm medical doctors. Extraplathg hm the US population, the amount spent on unconventiod medicine ($425 million) is higher than that spent on paimery are ($388 million) by $37 million. Despite unconventiod medicine's 178 popularity in North Arnerica, al1 but two college educated mpondents of the current study utilized other forms of unconventional medicine than traditional C hinese medicine. Al1 participants were given traditional Chinese herbal remedies in various degrees, and only some received other foms of treatrnent. The following is a description of treatments participants obtained fiom traditional Chinese medicine practitioners: Traditional Chinese herbal remedies were widely used. These remedies require synthesis and balance among numerous ingredients to be effective; thus the expertise of a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner is often solicited. Acupuncture is the implantation of thin nedes to different depths at a variety of meridian points gathered in comected arrays, accordhg to a sophisticated physiological theory, on the surface of the human body. Moxibustion is the burning of the herb Artemisia vulgaris on the top of an acupuncture needle, so that the heat is conducted to the body through the needle. Acupressure is a gentle form of stimulation of meridian points by means of pressure, using the thumbs, fingers, or hands. Shianis is a type of body work ociginating in Japan. It has mots in Japanese and Chinese acupuncture and massage. It involves meridian point stimulation and a variety of other techniques \u00eehat involve stretching and rotating of body parts, and use of the thumbs, hands, elbows, and knees of the practitioner on the client's body (Beal, 1992). C: Western medicine cannot get to the roots of the probiem Most of the participants in this study mnt to Western physicians first for help because these professionals' services are covered by the 0at.o Health lnsurance Plan (OHIP), and because these patients also wanted to k diagnosed utilipag modaa technology. Their impression toward Western medicine ha9 changecl Wt in cornpaison to tbe days wIm Westcni medicine first 179 came to China - that of a \"quick tix\" (Holden, 1964). The prractice of Western medicine has been to rely on objective diagnostic data, medical technology and the belief that diseases and illnesses are treated to allow a sense of control in the provision of care. This approach implicitly denies the lived experience of suffering from an illness and the inhennt uncertainty in the actual practice of medicine (Qui11 & Suchman, 1993). Even though Westem professionals were identified as a source of support, they were ais0 alleged to be a cause of frustration. A hi& degree of dissatisfaction with the medical care received by 15 CFS patients fiom the larger culture! has also been reported by others (Yeomans & Conway, 1991). Their dissatisfaction prompted 47% of them to use alternative therapies, such as homeopathy and herbal medicines. in the cumnt study, participants had davourable evaluations of the therapeutic outcomes of the Westem physicians they had consulted. They might have felt comfortable expressing their view, knowing that these physicians had no links to the interviewer, and no access to the information fiom the interviews. Participants' dissatisfaction mainly stemmed hm these physicians' failure to (1) deliver a \"quick fix\" despite numerous diagnostic tests, (2) accept the social reality and suffering associated with their clients' illness, (3) address culturai and linguistic disparities vis-\u00e0-vis their patients. Mind-body dualism pemeates much of the medical and popular cultures in the Westem world (Neinman, Brodwin, Good, B., & Good, M., 1992). In this view, the human body is viewed as a machine which the physician is equipped to repair. The manner in which Western medicine was intduced aad spread in China reinfocces this kind of expectation of Western medical practitioners by the Chinese. Momver, medical treatment, with a somatic orientation, may relieve the patient's fam\u00fcy of the psychoIogica1 burden of shame, guilt, and stigma (Lin, T. dk Lin, M., 198 1). For most Chinese patients, physicians an expected to maLe decisions and give tostnictions. Failing to do this, tbcy are vitwed as weak and incomptent (HBU, J., 1985). Not 180 king given a \"concrete\" diagnosis or effective treatment to alleviate their symptoms reinforced these sentiments. When an informant's search for quick relief arnong Western medicine practitioners failed, disappointment and disenchantment ensued. Participants' sutTering and feelings of self-worth were often deeply affected by the consistent disaffinnation of their illness by the health care workers they encountered. When their diagnostic tests were negative, these patients accepted the \"scientific\" findings that they might not have an organic problem and started looking for other explanations of their distress. Social problems associated with their immigration to Canada seemed to be the least stigmatizhg and most legitimate expianation for their illness. Although medical discourse claims to exclude the social conte* medical encounters can never be free of intluence hm the social structure to which caregivers and their clients belong (Waitzkin, 1989). In spite of sharing the same cultural background, there is social disparity between the physicians' mostly upper middle class and the participants' predominately lower middle class lifesty les. The physicians described in the present study seemed unable to appreciate the social issues confionting their clients. Like infonnants in Anderson's (1991, 1992) study, health professionals' disregard of the obstacles presented by the circumstances of the patient's everyday life was also cited by participants in the current study. Physicims who gave advice without giving consideration to the &y-to-day struggle and suffecing of their immigrant patients (such as \"ifyou are too tired to contime workjl& jus! rest at home\"), only lefi the patients feeling more finrstrated and in despair. Good (1994) observes that physicians and their patients categorize signs and symptoms of iliness differently. Eech organizes hem into concepts and ascnbes signincmce into a fashion appropriate to the senctioned laiiguage of their omi communities and existentid concem. Since categories and life worlds ditnr between patients d physici~~, medical ~~~V~*OIIS arr 181 filled with interruptions, misinterpretations, and failuns of understanding. Findings of the current study concur with Good's (1994) observation. Being fully aware of these differences and \u00e7tnving to minimize the odds of being misunderstood, participants sought help from Westem physicians of Chinese descent. Speaking the same native tongue, they hoped that these physicians would be able to appreciate their distress and concems, but thcy were soon disillusioned. Even though most patients were able to communicate in Chinese with their physicians, they still felt that they were not king understood because of different health beliefs. Most of these physicians were unable to comprehend the temiuiology and concepts of traditionai Chinese medicine in which the\u00f9 patients framed die explanation of their illness. Kieinman (1980) purported that Westem medicine practitioners communicate in the Ianguage of biomedical health concepts, while patients hold blended concepts fiom the popular (lay) and traditional health systems. Thus, the informants' dissatisfaction evolved fiom the perception that their physicians king Chinese themselves did not attempt to understand them despite expectations that their common cultural background should enable them to do so. Despite speakhg the same language, communication barriers existed between the physicians and the inforrnants because of differences in health paradigms. Westem medicine has its roots in the mind-body dichotomy which is a pduct of Westem culture and is in distinct contrast to the holistic approach of traditional Chinese medicine. Chinese patients may believe that an imbalance of emotions would disnirb the hction of the parallei organ, and a dysfunctionai organ leads to an emotiod imbalance (Ku0 & Hopkins Kavanagh, 1994). The inted organs in traditionai Chinese medicine, have the same names as in Western medicine, but may not share the same postulated composition, hction and location (Porkert, 1974). Thus, a compla.int of kidney weabuss, for example, may not indicate a 182 fiuictiond or organic disorder of the kidney as in Western medicine. This can be extremely conking to physicians who are not familiar with concepts of traditional Chinese medicine. Ots (1990) asserted that Western physicians of Chinese descent have lost contact with their own medical tradition. Due to the continued prevailing belief in \"scientism\" in China, there is a tendency for these physicians to be extremely reliant upon a biomedical point of view and almost totally disregard the biopsychosocial mode of viewing disease and illness. From the respondents' perspective, their physicians had been divorced fiorn their native culture. Al1 infonnants of this study were able to communicate with their family physicians directly. Those who were referred to non-Chinese speaking specialists encountered both language and cultural batriers. Like subjects in Watt and CO-workers' (1993) shidy of Chinese immigrants' experience with heaith care in Britain, and Yuan and colleagues' (1998) survey of the Chinese general public in Toronto, participants of the current study also experienced language barriers in communicating with their physicians. Interpreter services are often not available and consequently patients were Ieft feeling fnistrated and disappointed when they were unable to communicate with their caregivers &et waiting weeks if not months for their appointment D: Sehelp sometimes works; famiiy and Muid9 can k hdpfd if they accept there is an illness It has been reportcd that between 70% to 90% of health care received by various ethnic groups are provided within the domain of family, socid network, and members of the community (Kieinman, Eisenberg, & Gd, 1978). This domain codtutes the popular arena of the health care system in which most illnesses are managed and decisions regarding treatment choices are made (Kleinman, L980). Selfcare, which aii participants of tbis study made use of to various degrees is an integrai part of the popdar arena. With daily radio broadcasting and newspaper columns on various heaith topics, the burgeonhg Chinese mas media play an 183 important role in fuelling the activities of this arena. Many participants claimed that they obtained their most up-to-date Somation on CFS and health maintenance through the mass media which infonned them and allowed them to take care of themselves while most physiciaas told them that noihing could be done. Clements and colleagues (1997) reported that reduction of activity was the coping strategy employed by 76% of the 66 CF patients in their study. Moreovei, self care such as organizhg their day into rest and active penods, taking vitamins and minerais, and king on special diets were common practices of CF patients in the larger culture (Ax et al., 1997). Participants of the cumnt study also adopted many of these practices with culRual modifications. Traditional Chinese medicine ascribes somnolence, energy deficiency, weakness, lack of motivation and not wanting to speak as symptoms of Yin illnesses. Tonics that can strengthen the Yin and Yang forces as well as qi and blood are the usual treatment prescribed (Yarn, 1997). Consumption of dietary prescriptions which combine food and herbs, self-medication and the use of traditional treatment modalities, with or without the help of family and friends, are also common practices among the Chinese in health maintenance (Koo, 1984; Qin, 1992; Yan, B., 1991; Zhang, E., 1990); thus, self-help was a normative response of drawing on one's cultural reservoir in times of need. The high prevalence of self care among the participants may be due to the fact thet Chinese are less likely to recognize personal problems as being important enough to require the assistance of health professionals (Tracey, Leong, & Glidden, 1986). Furthemore, intexviewees' limited knowledge of the availability of heaith and social agencies may have incraed ibeV refiance on self cate. From their intewiews of a subset of 22 CF patients, in a study of 110 subjects hm the larger culture, Anderson and Farans (1997) found social support was diminished due to the 184 dwindl\u00efng capacity to enlist help and maintain social ties, apathetic responses fiom their social networks, inaccurate perceptions of their illness by the cornmunity at large, and the inability to plan activity due to distressing symptorns. Respondents of the current study reported similar problems. In Chinese families, caring is communicated through actions rather than words and concem is demonstnited through taking care of other's physical needs (Bond & Hwang, 1993). When farnily members wen told that there was \"nothing wrong\" with the patients, they started to withdmw their support for activities of daily living, such as cooking and cleaning. Participants were then lefi to s\u00eeruggle on their own with resulting resentment. E: For peace of mind, seek help from supernatural sources Out of desperation due to lack of improvement in thek condition, several interviewees sought help ftom supernanual sources, such as faith healers and Chien-wan mastea. In the context of this study, these caregivers belong to the folk arena of Kleimnan's Explanatory Mode1 of Illness (1980). Taoist faith healers had been reported to have successfully cured a man who had sought help fiom multiple Western medical docton and Chung-i's with no relief for his problem of \"feeling sleepy al1 day\" (Sing Tao Daily, 1997). Several participants who claimed to be Christians and church-goers also sought help fiom Taoist faith healers or had their family members act on their behaif. This rnight be fiowned upon by Christians fiom other cultures. As the first of the ten cornmanciments states \"Thou shall have no other gods before Mey' (Exodus 20:3). However, these participants did not see any contradiction in their behaviour, as they felt they were just trying to do their best to help themselves. The same attitude seems to apply to the\u00f9 helpseeking nom both Western physicians and traditionai Chinese medicine ptactitioners. Patients that have a metent view of their iliness hm their physicians shouid not be seen as simply having lack of information or king superstitious. Their behaviour may be an indication of their desperation for a cure (\u00fbood, 1994). 185 One of the participants, ML L. (#IS), a 46-year-old Christian hm Hong Kong who was working as a subway supervisor, had sought help from a Chien-wm master to find the cause of his fatigue. Chien-wan is a special kind of divination derived fiom Buddhist belief of the existence of hell. The divination specialist (sou1 caller), usually a middle-aged woman, travels to hell for her client(s) to xneet with hicher relative. When supposedly possessed by the spirit of this relative, she dialogues with and gives advice to her client(s) on behalf of the relative (Lin, K. M., 1981). The Chien-wan master employed by Mr. L. established her credibility and gained his trust by giving him information he believed that no one knew but himself. Participants who were Buddhist gave offerhg and worshipped in Buddhist temples, hoping to have their health restored. To halt the continuation of suffering, Buddhism promotes the performance of good deeds during one's lifetime to %ork out\" bad deeds committed by oneself or one's ancestors (Qui, 199 1). Bestowing offerings to temples are considered one of the ways to \"work out\" or pay for one's bad deeds. F: Mental heaith practitioncrs - can they help? Informants expressed hesitation to seek help or accept a referral to see a mental health practitioner. Perhaps, this was because they did not associate their ibess with a serious mental illness, or because mental illness is highly stigmatized amongst Chinese. In Chinese culture, tremendous stigma attaches to major mental illnesses as defined in Western medicine, especially those that characterizxi by ex\u00fbeme emotions or psychotic symptoms (Kleinmaa, 1980). Such feams are associated with the patient's uiability to contml or cope with profouedly disturbing affects and to maintain hamionious social relations, thus irnplying a personal and familial failure in living up to the culturai protocol of seff'iplhe and resulting in face-losing (Hu, 1944). Psychotic symptoms are considend to be caused by behg possessed by evil spirits, punisbment of \u00f4ad deeds committed by the pa\u00eeient or My, and hedity. People with these sympsoms are 186 often cared for at home by the family; help fiom spiritual sources are sought; Western mental health professiods would be consulted as Iast resort (Kleinman, 1980). Minor psychiatric problems are often framed as medical illness which allows the patient to assume a legitimate sick role without stigma (Kleinrnan, 1977). This attitude was revealed in the informants' opinions about how schizophrenic patients should be treated (Appendix H. General Illness Beliefs, p.306). The majority of the interviewees regarded schimphrenia as a serious mental illness and that when beyond the family's ability to keep the patient at home, a mental health professional's help should be sought. In traditional Chinese medicine, psychological or emotional disorders, as defined in Western medicine, have never ken regarded as a legitimate domain. Thus treatment of emotional disorders is not considered a chung-i i (traditional Chinese medicine practitioner) responsibility (Zhang, M., 1989). In Hong Kong, most mentally il1 patients with somatic symptoms seek help fiom general practitioners rather than psychiatrists. In order to avoid the stigrna of king labelled \"mentaily ill,\" these patients would refuse to use psychiatric services even though they are referred by their general practitioners (Chiu & Rimon, 1987). This kind of bias is shared by Chinese immigrants worldwide. Somathtion accounts for 35% of al1 ilhess visits made by Asian migrants in primary care. Instead of seeing mental heaith practitioners, migrants may seek medical attention for physical problems relating to their psychological States (Lin, E., Carter, & Kleinman, 1985). The foilowing have ken proposed as ceasons that deter immigrants fiom seeking help from mental health workers: 1. Cultural conceptions of mental disorder play a major role in determining the extent to which migrants access mentai hdth services. \"Minor\" disorders such as depression and adjustments, trigged by kreavemait or divorce, cegarded by many Canadians as legitimate 187 reasons to consult a mental health practitioner, are accepted by people fiom traditional cultures as a normal part of life not justifying professional help (Nguyen, 1984). Having limited language proficiency and knowledge of the Western concepts of psychotherapy, immigrants usually tum to familiar foms of heaith care, such as folk medicine or traditional medical facilities to deal with their emotional problems (Brislin, 1993; Y ing & Miller, 1992). Lack of information about existing mental health se~ces and a tendency favour self-help to deal with problems were reported as possible reasons for the under-utilization of mental health services by Chinatown cesidents in San Francisco (Loo et al., 1989). Chinese resist professional mental health care because they are socialized to keep personal problems in the family and to avoid tahg to outsiders about their private life, piirticularly about issues related to emotions (Lin, T., 1983). Indeed, fmily otiented stigma amongst the Chinese is one of the biggest obstacles in the provision of optimal mental heaith care to Chinese cornmunitics al1 over the world (Lin, K. M., 198 1). Despite the lack of effective treatment for CF to date, favourable cesults have been reported amongst patients who had undergone cognitive behaviour therapy. Butler and Chalder (1990) reported that the majocity (22/27) of CF patients demonstrated a significant improvement in their fatigue, mood and fiinctional impairment, following cognitive behaviour therapy. Sharpe and CO- workers (1996) also found that 73% (22130) of patients who received cognitive behaviour therapy, especially designed for patients with CFS, hact a much higher level of functioning compared to 27% (8130) of their countetparts who received ody medid care. These cesearchers claimed that this form of cognitive behaviour therapy, focused on helping patients to n-appraise theV illness beliefs, inc- activities and solve social problems, enhsnced the rehabilitation of patients with CFS. 188 On the other hand, Lloyd and CO-workers (1993) found in a double-blind placebosontrolled crial of 90 patients with CFS that there was no benefit hm cognitive behaviour therapy. They attributed the positive results of Butler and Chalder's (1990) study to selection bias and lack of a control group in the study. Aithough benefit fiom cognitive behaviour therapy may be possible, none of the participants had received or ken referred to this therapy. Interrelationsbips between Patterns of DUtress, Stigma, Pemived Cause and Help-Seeking Behaviour Kleinman (1980) maintains that al1 three anas of the health care system: professionai, popular and folk, articulate illness as a culturaily defhed experience. They establish systematic relationships among the experience of symptoms, beliefs of disease causation, specific patterns of illness behaviour, decisions concerning help-seeking, and evaiuations of therapeutic outcornes. In this section, variables that showed a statistical relationship will be discussed. Patterns of Distress and Perceived Cause The cultural construction of illness produces different interpretations of the causes of illness and the presentation of symptoms (Kleinman, 1980). Findings of this study supported this claim to certain extent. A statistically signifiant positive relationship was found between the participants' somatic distress an\u00e2 sexual activity as a perceived cause. This is in keephg with the traditionai Chinese hedth belief that excessive sexual activities lead to the exhaustion of ching (essence, sperm) which is produced in the kidney. Thus shen Rwi (Lidney weohuss), in turn, Ied to loss of yang (positive energy). Fatigue is an Scation of deficiency ofymg which wiii eventuaiiy precipitate a yin-yong mibPliire (Zhaag, E.. 1991). 189 A positive correlation was also identified between psychological distress and a perceived cause that is psychologically based. Despite the lack of differentiation between physical and psychological illnesses in traditional Chinese medicine. respondents were able to express some of their symptoms in psychological ternis and attribute them to a psychological etiology. It is apparent that these respondents were familiar with how distress is expressed in Western medicine, where physical and psychological symptoms are often classified separately. They bad also demonstrated that they felt cornfortable enough presenting these symptoms in a hospital setting where the cwnt study twk place. With a history of more than a century in China, Western medicine has become an integrai part of the Chinese health care system. Based on knowledge of this model, some participants attributed psychological distress to a psychological cause. Furthemore, the 'distress\" an\u00e2 the \"cause* may not be well- differentiated for some patients with reference to psychological or emotional issues; their responses could be biased by this lack of differentiation. Chalder and co-workers (1996) contend that patients who attribute their fatigue to social reasons have less distressing symptoms and enjoy a higher level of f'unctioning than those who consider the cause of theu fatigue to k physical or psychological. Such a protection is not shared by subjects of the cumnt study, as there was no correlation between a social perceived cause and any variables in the category of pattern of distress. Qualitative hdings of the current study indicate that most of the participants ascribed their iiiness to social causes, and the majority of them also suffered \u00fbemendous somatic distress. The resuits of this study refute those of Chaider and co- workers (19%). and suggest that it is not the same for Chjnese patients. Prittenis of Mstras and Heip-Seekh distress and seekhg help hm spmhul source. Subjccts of this study &rstood their somitic disaess as 190 the manifestation of imbalances or malhurtioaing of thek bodies. They avoided spiritual help, perhaps because they believed it would not provide symptom relief. Stigma and Pemived Cause A positive correlation was identified between stigma and king a victim of abuse as a perceived cause. Participants who reported such a perceived cause suffered abuses in the forms of domestic violence or racism. Behg a victim of these kiads of social adversities attests to a disharmony in one's interpersonal relationships and casts doubt on one's moral integrity as a well disciplined peaon. A Confician maxim judges one a failure if one falls short of king a decent person who is incapable of rnaintaining barmonious relationships with others (Ho, 1976). Due to the powerful stigma attachai to being a vich of such abuses, wne of the participants who suffered from domestic violence or racism revealed their anguish to others or Ned any formal cornplallits. This lack of action is in concert with data fiom a recent community survey conducted in the GTA which showed that although the majocity of those interviewed claimed racism as one of the major problems they had encountered since migrating to Canada, none had brought the issue to the attention of appropriate authorities (Wong, 1997). Avoidiag confrontation and xnaintaining harmony appcvs to be a common strategy employed by Chinese immigrants in coping with adverse situations. Another positive correlation was found between stigma and sexual activity as a perceived cause. Ho (1993) clah that 'atlxiety over sex was high\" amongst Chinese Pnd traditionaiiy Chinese have regarded sexual activities, such as masturbation, as shamefirl. Sexuai activities that are deemd inappropriate or shamefiiL have direct implications for hisher status. accordhg to Conhcius' ieachllig, one should k ashamd if o does my harm to OIE'S body which is endowcd by one's a~~~tors. Stim and HelpSeekina Bebaviour Although there was no correlation between the total stigma score and participants' he$- seeking behaviour, a positive correlation between social distress (al1 cited stigma) and help- seeking fiom Western medicine practitioners was identified. This is consistent with qualitative fmdings of the study. Respondents who experienced social distress in the form of stigma preferred seeing Westem physicians. probably they were hoping that a concrete medical diagnosis would provide a scientifc physical basis for theu distress, and in tutn. diminish the stigma of a psychological cause. Perceived Cause and Hdp-Seekinn Behaviour Cognitive processes have ken recognized as important correlates of illness and help- seeking experience. They may also shape the perceived cause of one's problems (Cheung, F. et ai., 1983; Kleinman, 1980, 1982). Qualitative findings of this study also showed that participants' perceptions of their social status as immigrants influenced how they enlisted help. A stmng comlation was identified between a perceived cause that is socially based and self- help and help-seeking fkom family and nicnds. This suggested that a socially based perceived caw influenced subjects' decision to try to help themselves or to turn to family and friends for help. This is in keeping with how Chinese people consider that social issues, such as family conflicts and coping with impacts of migration, should be handled within one's social network, rather than seek prof\u00e9ssiod assistance. The role of a social worker in the resolution of social discords is foreign to most, as such a role is uncornmon in Asia (Pearson & Phillips, 1994). Furthemore, the provision of conflict resolution or hcial assistance is not considered to be the job of physicians (Western or traditional Chinese medicine practitioners). This may have promptsd subjects to draw on the lirnited iesources for seiGhelp and help hm famiIy and fmnds. Paceived cause of social na- was also found to k positiveiy correIatrd with help 192 seeking from pnctitioners of alternative treatment. However, only two participants who were university educated and paid closed attention to the mass media on treatments of CFS sought help from this source. Heredity as a perceived cause and help-seekhg from Western physicians were fouad to be positively comlate\u00e2. This relationship is also reflected in the subjects' opinions toward epilepsy victims, with the major@ (58%) of the informants reporting epilepsy as a hereditary illness where sufferers would receive the best help from Western physicians (52%) (Appendix H. General Illness Beliefs, p.306). As illustrated in the perceived cause section of this chapter, respondents felt that they might have inherited a \"weak body\" from their ancestors and seeing a Westem physician, especially a specialist might help nile out such a possibility. A positive correlation was also found between heredity as a perceived cause and help- seeking fiom mental health practitioners. Some participants had close relatives who had sought help from mental health professionals for neurasthenia ancl this might have helped them to de the decision to consult one. Moreover, the lack of a \"concrete\" physiological base to their illness or satisfactory mamient outcornes fkom other health services might have led infamants to give mental health workers a try. However, a negative correlation was fouad between here\u00fbity and help-seeking From referring physician. Perhaps, participants felt that their family physicians might not have the indepth Lwwiedge a specialist would have to deal with a heredi\u00eeacy Wss . A negative correlation was identified between the perceived cause of sexual activity and Mpseeking nom a spiritual source. As discussed earlier, semai activity carries a moral impiication to a person and hiskr famiiy. Hence. it would k un\u00eeikely for the individual to bring se& issues out into the open to se& &elp hm temples or churches. 193 There were statistically sipnificant negative relatiomhips between perceived causes of ingestion and environmental factors and help-seeling fkom traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. Qualitative fmdings suggest that illmss etiologies of ingestion of contaminated foods and environmental factors are relatively new concepts, which informants leamed fiom the popular arena of the health care system, in particular the mass media. Although traditionai Chinese medicine does address the role extemal elements play in ibss causality , issues such as envuonmental hypersensitivity are largely perceived to be a Western phenornenon and are at odds with traditional Chinese medical concepts. Limitations of the Study The greatest limitation of this study is its lack of generalizability. Since al1 participants are Chinese immigrants fiom the Greater Toronto Area, it is apparent that the flcindings of this study may not be applicable to other Chinese Canadian immigrants, other ethnic groups in Canada or the Chinese people in general. \"Perception and subjectivity or 'bias' are essential data and a crucial part of the knowledge generated by qualitative research. Local context and the human story, of which each individuai and community story is a reflection, are primary goals of qualitative research, and not 'generalizability '.\" (Miller & Crabtree, 1 994, P. 348). This study provides an unique appreciation and understanding of the Chinese CF patients' iliness experience despite limited generalizability. Other limitations of the study include: 1. The small number of participants may have reduced the power to demonstrate a significant effect between variables (Kramer & Thiemann, 1987). 194 2. The investigator did not control for extraneous variables, such as social class and level of acculturation of the participants, which could affect their responses. 3. Although subjects appeared to be very willing in sharhg their experiences with the investigator, they rnight not have given full explanations for their actions. \"Subjects are seldom able to give full explanations of theu actions or intentions; dl they can offer are accounts about what they did and why\" (Denzin & Lincoln, 1994, p. 12). Furthemore, informants might not be able to give the best illustrations of their illness experience, as al1 of them were suffering fiom fatigue. 4. Interptetation of the data may be influenced by the investigator's knowledge and experience with the Chinese Canadian Community. Despite conscious efforts (such as continuous self reflection and heightened awareness) to keep potential investigator bias to the minimum, it may not be possible to disregard al1 preconceived ideas. 5. The study was limited to one culture. Valid cross-cultural cornparisons cannot be made until the study is replicated in another culture. Nevertheless, because most of the participants were deeply influenced by the traditional Chinese culture, the kdings in this study may prove to be valuable for health care workers caring for patients with traditionai Chinese health beliefs. 6. This study obtained its sample fiom refends by participants' family doctors; thus it was a convenience sample and might Mer hm selection bias. Those respondents who agreed to participate probably were more outgokg, familiar 6th the research process and had a positive experience with the referring physician. For participants whose relationships with their family doctors were less thaa favodle, in spite of reassurance of confidentiality, they might still downplay their dissatisfacton towards the refeming physician to avoid having their mgative comments reveaied to their doctors. Summary Results of this study have been discussed with reference to the traditional Chinese culture values, the theoretical fiamework, literatwe review and relevant researc Beliefs\" (Appendix, H. p.306). lnterrelationships of patterns of distress, stigma, perceived cause and help-seeking behaviour were discussed based on correlations identified between these variables. Limitations of the study were also addressed. Chaptet W IMPLICATIONS FOR THEORY, RESEARCH AND PRACTICE Results of this study have implications for theory, research and practice in the area of migrant health. Qualitative findings pmvide a glimpse of the lived experience and a partial understanding of the issues that confronted Chinese immigrants who saer fiom CF and weakness. However, the nonprobability sampling method and the relatively small sarnple size Lirnit the generalizability and representativemss of the quantitative data. Theo y Kleinman's (1980) Explanatory Model of Illness, as well as Gofhan's (1963) and Kleinman and colleagues' (1995) theones on individual stigma and family stigma provided a useful theoretical framework for this research. Through patients' personal accounts of their illness experiences; the present study bas demonstrated the applicability of these theocies in directing clinical practice and in generating Mer investigations in immigrant health issues. The theoretical framework of this snidy proposes relationships among patients' patterns of distress, stigma, peneived cause and helpseeking experiences. Through the Explanatory Model of Iiiness, Kieinman (1980) fonaulated a cultural construction of illness which asserts that illness is cuitdly shaped in the sense that how one perceives and copes with an iihess is based on the expianation and meaning one ascribes to the iiiness. This cultural construction of illness produces different interpretations of the causes of ihesses that inauence the pcesentations of symptoms and helpseeking patients contextual difl3cuities in the\u00fb social milieu resulthg fiom migration as participants presented a contextual construction Despite symptoms and etiology of their CF the most important cause of their fatigue, the of illness, with a culturai one as the backdrop. expressed in cultural medical tems, current contextuai problems in their immediate environment were alleged as the instigator of their illness process. This contextual construction of illness refers to patients' day-to-day confrontations with irresolvable social issues, such as inability to fully participate in the larger society due to lack of English proficiency and familiarity with Canadian society, interpersonal conflicts at home and workplace, nicism, financial difficulties, under- and unemployment. in fact, immigration was a watershed for the participants' camrs, lifestyles and social milieu, and as a result, it may have been inevitable for them to compare their past with their present. Consequently, most of them became disillusioned and dissatisfied. Kleinman's (1980) cultural construction of illness failed to address the immediate contexnial issues that confiont Unmigrant patients; issues they mut contend in addition to coping with their illness. Help-seeking in each of the three social arenas of the health care system (namely the jmpular, the professional and the folk) (Neinman, 1980) reflects patients' conceptuaiizations, organizations and interpretations of their illness experience. Yet, findings in this study showed that the nature of patients' symptoms was more important than the\u00f9 perceived causes in shaping their helpseeking behaviour. Regardless of their perceived cause, the respondents first sought help hm Western physicians in ordcr to relieve distressing symptoms and obtain a legituaate diagnosis. Historically, Western physicians have been perceived by the Chinese people as being able to deliver quick relief hm symptoms and to provide an indisputable scientific basis for illness. Consequently, they could avoid the stigma of king considemi lay or mentslly ill. As suggested in the theonticai tkamewodc, every iaformaat of this sbdy utiiized all duee arenas concurrently d interchangeably. However, the proportion of usage of each arena in 198 managing the\u00f9 CF was determined more by contexnial issues, rather than by perceived causes, as proposed by Kieinman (1 980). Important contextual circumstances included affordability and accessibility of caregiven, availability of supportive families and fiiends, their own help-seeking experiences in past illnesses (including those of theu families and fiiends), as well as fiom information in the mass media. The contextual circumstances rather than cultural health beliefs seemed to have a more profound influence on patients' help-seeking behaviours. Although the vast majority of respondents believed that only traditional Chinese medicine practitioners codd get to the root of their problems, financial constm.int was the primary deterrent inhibithg them from obtaining help from this group of caregivers. Thus, al1 respondents sought help fiom Western physicians and only those who were financially well off went to see practitionen of traditional Chinese medicine. This nflected the contextual reaiity of the participants which required them to conserve their limited resources, rather than to practise their cultural health beliefs. Study findings also concurred with Gofnnan (1963) that stigma reflects the social context. The participants expenenced persona1 stigma but were also concemed that they might have infiicted %bal stigma of race\" (p.4) on al1 Chinese Canadians. Since hard work is an espoused value in the Chinese culture, the respondents feared chat their CF and weakness would lead to the stereotyping of al1 Chinese by other Canadians as being lay and reluctant to work for a living. The impact of ''tribal stigma,\" which is more relevant to multicultural North Amerka, was not addressed by Kleinman and colleagues (1995). who developed their theory based on a homogeneous Chinese population. Nevertheless, the resdts of this study confirmed Kleinman and colleagues' (1995) view of stigma in the Chinese context as a moral blame which is not appW to the patient alone, but perhaps even more profoundiy to the family. Most of the participants wete more womed about the tepen:ussions (compromising My members' chances of marriage, social relations and family honour) that their \"medically unfounded\" illness would have on the\u00f9 farnilies than on their own well-being. Avoiding disclosure, which is one of the stigma coping strategies identitied by Gofnnan (1963), was most commonly utilized by the infamants. This stnitegy is in concert with the Chinese saying that \"family shame should not be spread outside.\" Use of this strategy irnplied the high level of stigma associated with theu illness and affecting their families. Revised Theoretical Framework According to the findings of this study, a revised theoreticai Wework for Chinese immigrant health is proposed. This Wework incorporates work by Kleinman (1980), Goffian (1963), and KJeiaman and CO-workers (1995) with the following modifications: Stigma is part and parcel of the suffering of a medically ill-defined illness. Moreover, stigma reflects a moral blame that is not only applied to the immigrant patients and their families, but also to their ethnic community and to people of the same ancestry. Symptoms may be presented and understood in culturai ternis, but perceived causes and help-seeking behaviours may take on a contextuai construction that reflects patients' immediate sources of distress in their social milieu and the accessibility of health services. Patients will first seek help fiom health care workers whom they perceive to be most capable of alleviating their symptoms within the\u00f9 financial means. Thus, it cm be said that perceived cause is over-ridden by practical considerations. It is noted that help-seeking behaviour is more influenced by the structure of the local health care system, availability of care providers and affordability of their services, ihan perceived causes. Patients who considemi yin-yang Unbaiance as the cause of their iiiness, would opt for the \"fieeY' Western medical services instead of the costly but culturally congruent traditionai Chinese medicine. This pcactice might be at\u00fcibuted to the Chinese cognitive style of dialectical 200 thinlcing which seeks to achieve compromise between extremes and acceptarice of contradiction when one is presented with two conflicting perspectives (Peng & Nisbett, 1999). In their study to delineate cultural differences of dialectics and reasoning about contradiction between Chinese and American university students, Peng and Nisbett (1999) reported that when two apparently contradictory propositions were presented, Chinese participants were more accepting of both propositions, while their Amencan counterparts polarized theu views. These researchea suggest that the tendency toward dialecticism of the Chinese may be seen as part of a general system of thought in which attention is directed toward the environment, and complexity and contradiction are therefore Aient. A dialectical approach enabled participants of the current study to tolerate and even appreciate contradiction. Such cultural value was reflected in their help-seeking decision making. They strove to seek the best help for their health within their financial means. In his recent work, Kleinman (1995) expressed resewations about the usefiilness of the cultural cons\u00fcuction of illness and has turned his focus to the global issues of social suffering, rather than the distress associated with illness experience (Weiss, 1999). Today, I am uncornfortable with the style and even the preoccupations of \"models,\" ethnocultural or other, which imply too much fonnalism, specificity, and authonal certainty, but models were def\u00efnitely in my mind in the 1970s (Klehan, 1995, p. 7). Notwithstanding Kleinman's (1995) repudiation, his Illness Explanatory Model's focus on patients' illness experience allows it to maintain \"its continuity and cunency\" (Weiss, 1999, p.13). With local adaptation and modification, the fuadamental tenets of the Explanatory Modei of Ihess (Kleinman, 1980) continues to play an inf'luential mle in application in clinical pmtice and reseamh. Researc h The increasingly diverse Canadian multicuiturai mosaic prompts the need to study cultural differences in illness experience as a matter of urgent practical importance. Findings in this study point out important considerations for f\u00f9ture investigations, including: (1) Replicate the current study with d\u00fcrerent population Findings of this study reflect the illness experiences of Chinese immigrants with CF and weakness in Metropolitan Toronto, They need to be replicated in different settings and with ethocultural groups to compare explanatory models of CF. in this way, the illness experience of patients in various communities who suffer from chronic illness which is medically not well defined can be delineated. (2) Intcgrate qualitative and quantitative methods to validate cultural issues Integrating qualitative and descriptive quantitative methods in this study has proven to be beneficial in the cross-referencing of data. To understand illness experience, for instance, recurring themes generated fiom the qualitative fmdings, such as a perceived cause that is socially based, were substantiated by the high fnquency of responses in the quantitative data. Furthemore, participants' narratives, which illustrated repeatedly their strong conviction about the impact of social issues on their illness, reinforceci the quantitative results of the variable of perceived social causes. Hence, integrating qualitative and quantitative appmaches allow cross- referencing and validation of findings. This study proved the EMIC to be a useful semi- structured instrument to elicit both quantitative and qualitative data Nevertheless, new open- ended questions pertainiag to immigration issues should be developed and added to the cunent version for study populations that involve immigrants. (3) Coaduct longitudinal study to monitor illness experience over time The literature reviewed indicated that research in CF and migrant health is unanimously cross-sectional (including this stud y ). Longitudinal investigations are needed to better understand the patients' illness experience over the, and the progress of immigrant patients' help-seeking preferences. Findings of this study revealed the important role played by the fmily in the illness experience. The family's perspective of the patient's premorbid condition and the impact the patient's illness on the family over time should be investigated. Results fiom longitudinal inquiries may also assist health care workers in determining the types of interventions needed to support these patients as they are coping with their illmss and with integration into a new culture* (4) Perform outcome evaluation of bealth and social programmes to improve quality of services for immigrants Health program planning without consideration of the patients' illness experience is unlikely to be useful or to serve the interests of the immigrant patient population. Research is nquired to solicit input fiom culturally diverse patient groups in the planning and evaluation of health services. This is compatible with the present tnnd in nealth outcome research to combine the perspectives of health professionals and patients. Future reseacch should be designed to involve both patients and their caregivers, to iden* &screpancies in expectatioas and to undertake remedial measures to improve patient care. Health pmviders' knowledge of and attitudes toward health ptactices of diverse cultural groups also need to be examineci. NomWestern immigrants' opinions of Western heaith care shouid also be investigated to gain the users' perspective. P ractice The majonty of the participants indicated that most of the Western medicine practitioners they had consulted were not effective in treating their illness, mainly because of the disparity between their health beliefs and social status, and those of the physicians. Therefore, it is important for the clinician to recognize that each individual, including caregivers and patients, sees the world through hidher own culturai lens. Caregiven must be cognisant of the cultural and professional biases they bring into the client-therapist relationship. Tnuiscultural health care issues should be a required component of health can workers' continuing education. Practitioners must treat each patient as an individual with unique needs, which rnay or may not be related to their cultural roots, including values, beliefs and traditions. No cultural heritage will wholly explain how any given individual will think and act, but it can help health care worken anticipate and understand how and why patients make certain decisions (Groce Bt Zola, 1993). The impact of migration infiltrates every facet of patients' illness experiences. Stress associated with the adjus\u00fbnent to Canadian life and living with a \"medically not-well-defined\" illness needs to be recognized. Respondents complained that their physicians did not take them seriously which compounded their srnering. Practitioners must appreciate that subjective symptoms such as fatigue and weakness are an ongoing impingement on the patients' daily lives even when there are no clinical findings. Due to the \"unknown nature\" of the iliness, and the cultural value of hard work and family glory, stigma is a major concem to many patients. In the Chinese culture, \"face\" is important in the maintenance of social respectability, public family image and seIfkteem. These immigrants were particulady aware of the impact of their actions on th& fernilies' \"face,\" given that they perccived themselves as dections of their families and cuiturai groups rather than as autommous in\u00e2ividuais. Assurauce of confidentiality is, tberefore, crucial to the therspeutic relationship with these clients. Based on the results of this study, recomrnendations and implications for clinicd practice are presented below under the following headings: (1) communication, (2) assessment, (3) intervention, (4) social support, and (5) advocacy. (1) Communication Findings of the current study indicated that communication barriers can still develop between patients and care providers, even when the latter share similar linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Differences in nosology and principles in their respective health care systems, social status, levels of education and acculturation, posed challenges to clhician-client communication. The communication barrier is even pater when patients and practitioners do not share the same culture or language. The lack of professional cultural interpreters to bridge the communication gap renden both parties fctling hmted and dissatisfied with Western health care. Health care workers should consider patients' sufEerhg in a cultural aad social context, and be aware that for patients in many parts of the world and amongst difEerent ethnocultural groups, there is no sharp distinction between somatic and psychological symptoms. Diagnostic categories that combine somatic and psychologicai symptoms are popular in many countries (Weiss, Raguram, & ChannabasavaMa, 1995). Like participants of this study, symptoms may be articuiated interchangeably in physical, psychologid, culturai and social tem. As the biomedical viewpoint is both culture specific and value-laden, care providers need to move away fiom the current ethnocentric Western framework and recognk that the ciinical reality is cuiWy constn~cted and pluralistic et Kirmayer tbat thctapists' pteoccupation with specinc words of afli\u00e9ct may 205 be problematic in their communication with clients. Patients who do not express their feelings in affective temis, but use somatic idioms instead, should not be regarded as incapable of describing their psychological distress. In the present study, the participants' expressions of predominantly somatic symptoms were consistent with traditional Chinese medical nosology, rather than with clinical categories of Western medicine. The meaning and symbolic value of symptoms, even sharing the same names, may be culturally specific and are not necessarily interchangeable between cultures (Kleinman et al., 1978). Somatic idioms (or physicai metaphors) of narration should be understood as a cry for help in a specific cultural context. Health professionals working in a multicultural setting must make an extra effort to understand their patients' explanations of illness and what these expressions may mean to the clients. For example, \"shen kuei \" (kidney deficiency or weakness) may cany drastically Werent connotations to the clients and practitioners. Without clarification of such a 'Yoreign\" concept fiom the patients or the literature, health professionals' ability to provide quality care will be compromised and patient satisfaction jeopardised. Participants may have at\u00fcibuted the cause of their fatigue to social and familial conflicts nsulting from migration because they perceived these causes as socially acceptable to others as they were immigrants. Perhaps, they felt comfortable using these issues as an entry point to deal with other personal problems. In order to facilitate communication, caregivers should fust address the patients' immediate concems associated with adjustrnent to Canadian life and changes in fsmily dynamics. They should also be prepared to consider other issues, of course. Most of the Chinese patients in this shidy held a paterdistic concept of the\u00fc physicians. They expected their physiciam to exercise professional expertise by presctibing medications and treatment, without the patient having to ask. To maintain hannony, the majority of individds \"moved on\" to 0th physicians and alternative therapies, ratha than voice their dissafisfacfion. 206 Employing cuituraily sensitive communication skills would help elicit the concems of this group of patients. (2) Assessment Overcoming cultural and linguistic barriers is prerequisite to a thorough assessment. An investigation and understanding of values, beliefs, and noms of clientele fiom diverse cultures can afTord considerable insight and understanding to the clinician's practice. A qualitative understanding of illness experience will enhance the development of effective, culturally relevant therapies that acknowledge and work with patients' explanatory models (Kareem & Littlewood, 1992). Obtaining idormation about a client's heritage and taking the time to leam about the relationship between clients' beliefs and their respective interpretation of illness would allow the formulation of meaningfbl therapeutic measures. Caregivers who do not explore beyond general questions about the patient's distress will not know about the various factors that impact on their patient's illness experience. Eliciting the patient's explanatory mode1 of iliness and achowledging values, beliefs, and fears should be the first steps to assessment. A migration-specific heaith assessment tool that includes an evaluation of the patient's physical, psychological, cultural, social and migration history could be developed and irnplemented. This tool could start with a systematic physical and psychological appraisal to identify the principa\u00ee ffactors that precipitated illness, including physiological disorders, misinterpcetation of bodily sensations, mood abnormalities, ineffective coping behaviours, and social stresses (Mayou & Sharpe, 1997). The cultural and social components of the assessment wlicit the patients' cuiturai and social perceived causes of their ilinesses, an\u00e2 the\u00f9 heIp-seebg experiences. intetpersonal aad occupational problems as weii as the fdy's understanding of their illness shodd ab be delinerrted and addresse\u00e0.. A migration 207 history that elicits the patient's teasons for migration, sequence of events during migration, their pre-migration sociocultural and socio-economic backgrounds, helpseeking behaviours, and mode of access to the health care system in the country of origin, would provide the needed background to their current explanatory mode1 of illness. Patients' accounts of distresses should be accepted and acknowledged as genuine expressions of their suffering and the reality of the cornplaint should not be disputed. A tolerant approach to benign therapies is also advisable to maintain rapport (Matthews, Manu, & Lane, 1991). To provide culturally sensitive care, pcactitioners cm acknowledge the dity of patients' symptorns and distress and impaired fiuictioning, without necessarily agreeing with them about the cause. Health cm providers need to invite patients to share their explanation of illness with the assunuices that their beliefs will not be judged or dismissed as inaccurate representations (Gesler, 199 1). For example, while practitioners may be quick to correct a patient who describes hisher fatigue as the result of 'bad /eng shui, \" such behaviour ignores the patient's emotional and metaphoricai context of illness etiology. It is important for caregivers not to argue with patients regardhg the explanation of their illness even if then are good reasons to believe that the patients' interpretation may not be consistent with scientific pnnciples. If the patients' unscientific beliefs lead to their rejection of needed medical treatment, the consequences of such an action must be explained in detail to the patients to allow an informed decision to be made. With the patients' permission, their family members should aiso k involved in die decision making process. Expert opinions on treatment refusal fkom a medical ethicist, knowledgeable in culhiral health behavioucs, should also be sought. Clinicians shouid not undermine patients' coherent explmations of illness that have provided them with a foudation for coping and self- care. The patients' kkfs shouid be adcnowledged, addressed, and accepted as legitimate topics for discussion. 208 Paying close attention to cultural and social meanings of symptoms and illness will allow clinicians to make a more accurate assessrnent of culturally diverse patients and to devise interventions that respect them and effectively mobilize their personal, farnily and community resources (Kirmayer et al., 1994). Interviewhg patients alone and with their family memben would help to obtain Uifomation fiom different perspectives, thus facilitating the formulation of a comprehensive and workable treatment plan for the patients. (3) Interventions Culturally sensitive interventions must not simply take patients' cornplaints or concems at face value but should hvolve an appreciation of their social implications. Effective treatment also requires consideration of the impact of migration and gender on patients' illness experience. Health care workers should focus not just on the patient's physical cornplaint but should take a more holistic approach. In view of their pluralistic helpseeking behaviour, caregivea need to tolerate contradictions or complementary views of Chinese patients in the explanations of theu illness and in theu help-seeking behaviour. Professional explanations of their illness should be introduced slowly without \u00e2iscounting patients' folk beliefs. Indeed, such an approach should be taken with al1 patients. To be of benefit to patients, medical care needs to take their social context into consideration. Hedth education materials should be modified to incorporate prevailing Western health concepts, pcinciples of traditional Chinese medicine, and information hm the mass media. Discussion with patients about the meanings of fatigue, theh past experience with fatigue, and their current expectations about its progress should be essential components of any patient education programme in the management of fatigue. Subsequently, pdd strategies tbat assist this group of previously active patients in wphg with activities of My li\u00fcving should be 209 explored. Patients should be encouraged to monitor their energy levels and to schedule arduous tasks to be accomplished if there are times in the day in when energy levels increase (Wood, Magnello, & Sharpe, 1992). A health tearn should take a multidisciplinary approach tbat incorporates community resources and health expertise to meet the multifaceted needs of the CF patient. Patients shouid be referred to appropriate members of the health team when the\u00f9 needs are beyond the scope of the particular caregiver. Participants of this study alleged that lack of cosrdination and liaison between caregivers created confiision and fius\u00fbation for them. A line of communication between hesilth care providers should be established to avoid duplication of services and contradictions in the recommendations for cm. in many cases, the only communication is between the family doctor and the refemng specialist, with no communication among other caregivers. In the present study, the vast majority of participants did not tell theu physicians that they were seeing other practitionen for fear of offending them or king perceived as having a lack of confidence in theu physicians' ability to treat their illness. On the other hand, traditional Chinese practtioners expected the participants to have a Western physician as their family doctor, and often asked the patient to have certain laboratory tests done to nile out other illnesses, such as diabetes or hypothyroidism. There should be more effort for collaboration amongst patients' caregiven. Since the majority of the respondents had tnisting relationships with their fdy doctors, perhaps with adequate compensation fiom the Ontario Health lnsursnce Plan (OIIIP) for theu the and efforts, this group of practitioners should take on the de of a care cosrdinator, to avoid fhgmentation of patient cm. Most infoirmants ofthe cunent study, felt that only pas*ents, who suffi hm major mental illness such as scbphrenia needed to be tnated by mentai heaith professionais. This 210 misconception, which may apply to Chinese immigrants in general, deterred informants fiom enlisting help hm this group of practitioners. Community education in the area of mental heaith is urgently needed to allow a better understanding of the roles of mental health workers in Canada. Health professionals need to work with comunity agencies to educate the immigrant population about the roles of mental health practitioners and potential mental health issues confkonting dl immigrant communities. Because of this belief and because of the stigma associated with mental illness, general practitioners with in-depth knowledge of the Chinese perception of mentai illness and who enjoy a tnisting relationship with their patients and families are ideal to provide holistic are. Mental health services should also be delivered in conjunction with other services, such as employment assistance, education and integration to the larger society . (4) Social support Since al1 informants received help fiom their family and fnends, health care workers should capitalize on these natural modes of support and provide assistance and resources to this system. Health care workers should also take a non-judgmental appmach, and review their patients on a reguiar basis to assess the efficacy or any harrnfbl effects of self care. in view of the pragrnatic approach to treatment of the Chinese (Lin, T. d\u00e9 Lin, M., 1981), clinicians need to assure that a sense of accomplishment has ken achieved after each patient- clinician encounter. Should medical intervention not be required as part of the treatment, other tangible aid, mch as referrals to appropriate community agencies should be offered, where social and Uistrumental (e.g.. employment) support are provideci. Aithough patients gaincd some temporary cornfort hm theu physicians is fine hm the tests,\" savices hm otha memb patients' concsms. 211 As hdicated by the infamants' experience with community social services, caregivers should ensure that these linkages are desirable and easily accessible to the patients. Through community and social agencies, immigrant patients will be able to acquire the necessary survival skills for their new lives in Canada, They can be taught \"Canadian\" day-to-day living skills such as snow shovelling and meal preparation (such as shopping for a week's food and proper renigeration rather than the common practice of daily grocery shopping in their places of origin). Language can be used as a powerf\u00f9l resource in boosthg self-esteem. Fostenng English proficiency has been found to reduce the impact of acculturation stressors (Nicassio et al., 1986). Special ESL (English as a second language) classes designed for people with poor memory would be beneficial for this group of patients. They also need to be infonned of Canadian cultural and social protocols, be equipped with concrete problem solving skills and guided in how to handle issues of day-to-day living, such as improwig employment statu, fostering favourable working conditions and combating racism. Traditional values of close family ties and hannony can encourage the hiding of problems in the home, such as domestic violence and racism. Due to the absence of extended family support and mediation in the event of familial conflict, community social services' roles should be promoted in family conflict resolution. Since the vast majority of participants relied heavily on the Chinese mass media for information, utilization of these services should also be encouraged through this channel. (5) Advocacy Findhgs of this study demonstratecl that patients who are immigrants, pdcuiarly those with a poorly dehed illness such as CF, are in a very vuherable position for mental heaith problems. Their highiy stnssfui lives are compounded wi\u00eeh th& limiteci abiiity and knowledge 212 to obtain support. In order to provide equitable and compassionate heaith care to this gmup of patients, who are confionting multiple health risks, al1 health care providers should take upon themselves the role of patient advocates. We should first examine how our fiiture health care providers are king educated. As Canada becomes increasingly rnulticuiturai, intercultural and interracial education needs to be an integral component of curriculum for health care professional (Cornmittee for intercultural and Interracial Education in Professional Schools, 1994). Impact of culture on illness experience should be a required component of continuing education for front line health care workers. Intonnants of this study expressed their hstration and disappointment at not king able to communkate with non-Chinese speaking health care providers. Professional cdhd interpeten are not available in most health organizations in Ontario (Ministry of Culture and Citizenship, 1999). Front-line health care workea should lobby health organization administraton to allocate resounrs to have professional health interpreten be included as an integral part of the health care team, particularly, in parts of Canada that have a high concentration of non-English speaking immigrant populations. The Canadian Govemment should advise potentiai immigrants of ways to get their credentials recognized, and the reality of not being recognized in some prof'sions to prevent false hope and despair. Anti-racism policies and strict enforcement should be in place to minimize discrimination and inequality in employment. Through the school system and the mass media, the generai Canadian public should also be informed of the obstacles confronthg new immigrants. It is pivotal for Canadians to understand, W<e their forefathers, that these newcomers need to be w\u00efth th& own people to achieve a sense of security rather than haviag the\u00f9 kbviour interpreted that they are not otg to accdtwate into the Canadian culture. Conclusion This ethnographic study with a quantitative component is the tirst expioration of the illness experience of CF and weakness of Canadian Chinese immigrants. Its primary focus is on how culture shapes the illness experience of Chinese immigrants. The Explanatory Mode1 Interview Catalogue (EMIC) (Weiss, 1997), a semistnictured instrument, was adapted and used to elicit the rich expenence of this group of patients. Kleinman (1980), Gohan (1963), and Kleinman and CO-workers (1995) contributed to the theoreticai basis that directed this study. Based on the findings of this study, modifications and revisions of their theoretical fbmework are proposed. This new framework, which takes into consideration the powerful impact of cumnt day-to-day contexnial adversities, sucb as interpersonal conflicts, racism, underemployment and unemployment, on the illness experience of first generation immigrants, calls for a contextual construction instead of cultural construction of iliness as proposed by Kleinrnan (1 980). The theme of the impact of migration transcends the narratives of al1 participants. These patients endured multiple symptoms and presented their discodort using pmlominately somatic and traditional Chinese medicai ternis. Although integrai to their pattern of distress, psychological symptoms were minimized by participants. Behg a victim of a \"medically not well define\u00e2\" illness and an immigrant in a fonign land irnposed trernendous stress on these individuals. The fear implied by mental illnesses without an organic diagnosis was associated with a sense of failure about not living up to one's obligations, as defined by the Chinese ethos of hard work. Study participants felt stigmatized, not just for themselves but for their families, the Cariadian Chinese community and the Chinese people as a whoIe. Consistent with hdings nported in the iitastun, inform~ts of this study sought help fiom 214 multiple sources to cope with their illness. Being understanding and willing to Iisten to their concems were qualities identified in caring physicians. A statistically significant correlation was found between socially based perceived causes and self-help and help-seeking fiom family and fnends. This is congruent with traditional Chinese noms that individuals with social dificulties are expected to tum to family and close fkiends for assistance. Findings of this study attest to the complexity of patients' explanatory models of illness. In future research and education of health care workea, the relationships between patients' explanatory models of illness and thek illness experiences in the Canadian multicultural mosaic will need to be addressed. Clinicians wed to pay special attention in caring for this group of patients, especially, the patient's suffering associated with a rnedically not well defined illness, in addition to al1 the challenges confionting immigrants.

APPENDPX Sm OF ILWE!SS We are asking you to participate in a study of the meaning of illness. If you agree to an interview with the project staff, we will -ask about your ideas about illness, how you get help and othar questions about your life. The length of these fnterviews usually ranges from 1 1/2 to 4 hours, although this one could be a little longer or a little shorter. Doctots use their knowledge to help patients. This knowledge contes from exparience treating patients and from resaarch. ~artici~ation in this research: study is gpt required for you to get the help and treatment you came here for, and you may leave the stu\u00e0y at any time vtthout any effect on your treatment. potential Risks: hving the interview it i~'~ossible, though not lik\u00e8ly, that you may find it upsetting to talk about soma of the issues we ask abouti You may stop the interview at an. the or refusa to answer any question.

It begins the inquiry with an open-ended question followed by screening questions about various somatic, psychological, social and other distresses, and concludes with a summary question. Each of the responses is rated according to the subject's (1) mode of reporting, whether it is spontaneous or probed, and (2) designation of importance to the response, if the symptom is emphasized or just mentioned. To conclude the section, the subject is asked to identify the fust and the one most troubling symptom experienced. Rankings of these respmses are added to obtain a score for each of the individual symptom categories (prominence ranking variables). The range of score is fiom O to 5. with O indicating the distress is not rnentioned to 5 the highest distress. The prominence rankllig of each individual variable is derived additively fiom three contributions. if the symptom is: Contribution (1) Mentioned spontaneously (EMIC# Io) 2 or afkr probing (EMIC #16.2-16.3) 1 Othenirise O (2) Reported as fkst symptom noticed (EMIC #17) 1 (3) Reported as the most troublhg symptom (EMIC #22) 2 For example, if Mr. A repoitod spontaneously that fatigue was the pmbiem for which he sought help, he gets a contribution of 2 to the rankuig. Mr. A., af'ter pmbing, mentioned that he was having a problem falling esleep (contributuig 1). He later also said \u00eehat fatigue was the fht symptom he notid (contributing l), and it was the most troubling symptom of aii (contributhg 292 2). Adding al1 the contributions, 2+1+2=5, Mr. A gets the highest ranking possible for the individual variable of fatigue. For the individual variable of sleep disturbance he only gets a ranking of 1, because he had already indicated fatigue as the fiist and most troubling symptom. Thus, there is no Mer contribution to the ranking of sleep disturbance. Data Reduction -- - Due to the large number of variables which resuited in a small number of responses in each dl, data reduction was conducted to classi@ variables with related meanings into grouped variables for quantitative analyses and hypothesis testing. The sixteen individual variables were sorted into four logical groupings to form four, grouped pattern of distress variables: PD- Somatic, PD-Psychological, PD-Social and PD-Other. For instance, the grouped variable PD- Somatic is made up of the first 4 and # 8 of the patterns of distress individual scons: Fatigue, Weakness, Somatic Symptoms, Hypochondriacal Symptoms, and Sleep Disturbance. The following table depicts the classifications of the grouped variables of patterns of distress: Psycho togical Social Other Crouped Variables # Groupai Variables Patterns of Distress # in EMlC Individual Variables 1 Somatic I Fatigue 2 Weakness 3 Somatic Symptoms 4 Hypochondnacal S ymptorns 8 Sleep Disturbance 5 Depress Symptoms 6 Loneliness 7 Anxiety S yrnptoms 9 Functional Impairment 10 Cognitive [mpainnent 13 Amot ivational Symptoms 11 Social Relations 12 Stigma 14 Not Troubled 15 Other 16 Cannot Say Croupcd Scores Construction of Interval Scale of Prominence Rankings As showed in the data reduction section above, the four grouped variables are formed by grouping individual variables with similar meanings. The following is the procedure to obtain the grouped patterns of distress score (interval scale of prominence rankings): (1) Take the highest contribution among the individuai variables withlli each grouped variable, in response to open-ended questions (EMIC#I6), as the contribution for the grouped variable. (2) Take the highest contribution among the individual variables within each grouped variable, in response to probing question (EMIC #16.2-16.3), as the contribution for the grouped variable. (3) Take the individual variable which is indicated as the first (EMICHi) noticed, and also the most troubling symptom (EMIC#22) as the ones for the grouped variable. For instance, if Mr. A reported fatigue spontaneously as the problem for which he sought help, he gets a contribution of 2 to the somatic grouped variable score. Since fatigue is one of the individual variables in the somatic grouped variable and 2 is the highest contribution, the somatic grouped variable gets this contribution. Even though he bas a score of 1 fot sleep disturbance 294 which is also one of the individuai variables in the grouped variable, king a lower nurnber than 2, it is disregarded. nie somatic grouped variable also gets contributions fiom fatigue king the first symptom he noticed (contributing 1), and the most troubling symptom (contributing 2). Furthemore, the contribution of a probing response is added only if no other symptom in the grouped variable is rated spontaneous or most important. Adding al1 the contributions, 2+1+2=5, Mr. A gets the highest score possible for the somatic grouped variable. Source: Weiss, M. (1 997). APPENDIX E: Perceived Cause - Computation of Prominence Rankings as Analysis Variables and Data Reduction Individual Scores Computation of Analysis Variables: Interval Scale of Prominence Rankings The Perceived Cause section of the EMIC enquires into the patients' personal ideas of the attributions that resulted in their illness. This section begins the inquiry with an open-ended question followed by 55 screening questions of different perceived causes, and concludes with a summary question. Each of the rtsponses is rated according to the subject's (1) mode of reporting, whether it is spontaneous or probed, and (2) designation of importance to the response, if the perceived cause is reported as \"definite\" or as \"possible? To conclude the section, the subject is asked to ide&@ the first and the one rnost important perceived cause. Rankings of these responses are added to obtain a score for each of the individual perceived came categories (prominence ranking variables). The range of score is from O to 10, with O indicating not reported as a perceived cause to 10 a perceived cause with the highest importance. The prominence ranking of each individual perceived cause categories is derived additively fiom three contributions. If the perceived cause is: Contribution (1) Repoged s ntaneously as a cause to open-ended ue*m - Reported as fht perceived cause (EMIC Ml) (3) Reportcd as the most important perceived cause (EMIC#43) For example, if Mr. A reported spontaneously that malnutrition was the cause of his problem, he gets a contribution of 4 to the ranking. Mr. A., after probing, mentioned that his smoking is definitely a cause also (con\u00fbibuting 3). He later reported that malnutrition was the cause he first thought of (contributing 1), and it was the most important cause of al1 (contributing 5). Adding al1 the contributions, 4+1+5=10, Mr. A gets the highest ranking possible for the individual category of malnutrition. For the individual category of smoking he only gets a ranking of 3, because he had indicated malnutrition as the first and most important cause. Thus, there is no mer contribution nom this category to the raaking. Data Re\u00e2uction Due to the large number of variables which resdted in a small number of responses in each cell, data reduction was conducted to classify variables with related meanings into grouped variables for quantitative analyses and hypothesis testing. The summary scores of 55 individual perceived cause categories were sorted into 12 logical groupings to fom 12 new For instance, the clustered category PC-Ingestion is made up of the summary scores of the first 6 perceived cause individual categories: Food/Water, NutritioniMalnutrition, Alcohol, Smoking, Abused Dmg, and Prescribe\u00e2/Over the Counter Medication. The following table depicts the groupings of the clustered categor\u00eees of peiwived cause: Cluster CategoryU Abused hg PrescribedOTC Med Overwotk-Exertion Nerves Injiuy/Accident/Surgery Prior 1 hess Immune Dysfct/Allergy Vhs/Germs/Infection Anatomic/Phy/Biochem Pregnancy Related EnvMoxinJ Pollution Poor Health Habits Personal Hygiene Fuiancial Pmblem Failed Romance Roblem Abuse Ancestral Spirits Geomanq Other Supmatural Bad Kidney Weakness Semen Loss Heat-Cold in Body Clhate: Hcat-Cold Etc. Vital Energy (Qi) Yin-Ymg Imbalance 0th HumoraVConst 1mba.i Mer (SpecifL) CIustered Scores Construction of Interval Scale of Prominence Rankinp As showed in the data reduction section above, the 12 clustered categories are formed by grouping individual categories with related meaaings. The following is the procedure to obtain the clustered perceived cause score (interval scale of prominence rankings): ( I) Take the highest contribution among the individual categories within each clustered category, in response to open-ended questions (EMIC#38), as the contribution for the clustered category. (2) Take the highest contribution among the individuai categories within each clustered category, in response to probing question (EMIC #40), as the contribution for the clustered category. (3) Take the individual category which is hdicated as the first (EMIC #41) noticed, and also the most important (EMIC #43) as the ones for the clusterrd category. For instance, Mr. A reported malnutrition spontaneously with emphasis as the problem for which he sought help. Since malnutrition is one of the individual category in the ingestion clustered category and 4 is the highest contribution, the ingestion clustered category gets this contribution. Even though he has a score of 3 for smoking which is also one of the individual categories in the clustered category, being a lower number than 4 it is disregarded. Furthemore, the contriion of a probing response is added oniy if no other perceived caw in the clustered category is rated spontaneous or most important. The ingestion clustered category also gets contributions fiom malnutrition king the fiRt perceived cause (contributing l), and the rnost important (contributing 5). Adding al1 the contributions, 4+1+5=10, Mt. A gets the highest score possible for the ingestion clustered category. Source: Weiss, M. (1997). APPENDIX F: Help-Seeking Behaviour- Computation of Prominence Rankuigs as Analysis Variables and Data Reduction Individual Scores of Analvsis Variables: Interval Scale of Prominence Rankiags The Help-Seeking Behaviour section of the EMIC enquires into the subjects' personal experience of help-seeking for kir illness. This section begins the inquiry wiih an open-ended question followed by 26 screening questions of different source of help-seeking, and concludes with a summary question. Each of the responses is rated according to the subject's (1) mode of reporting, whether it is spontaneous or probed, (2) current preference and satisfaction with help, and (3) designation of importance to the response, if the help is reported as \"yes, usefil\", bbpossibly useful\", \"uncertain\", or \"not useful\". To conclude the section, the subject is asked to identify the first and the one most important source of help. Rankings of these responses are added to obtain a score for each of the individuai help-seeking categories (prominence ranking variables). The range of score is hm O to 17, with O, indicating a source of help not mentioned, to 17, a source of help with the highest importance. The prominence ranking of each individual help-seeking categories is derived additively nom the following four contributions: Mentionhg spontaneously (item #46.l) or fiom screening (#47), considering expression of usefiilness as Tried Code Contribution 1 3=possibly yes for \"another\" 2-0 t tned for this or other 2. Current pnference as for most usehl (#48) Category rnentioned 3. First help xeking and Tes satisfed ,. Most Important 4=Uncertain 2=No item not mentioned 4 if yes, O if no For example, if Mt. A reported spontaneously that a Chinese herbalist was the source of help he had eied and found useful, he gets a contribution of 5 to the ranking. He also indicated that his \"cumnt\" pref\u00e8rence for help-seeking was also this practitioner, because he found him most usefbl (contributing 4). However, der probing, Mr. A., mentioned that he had tried a faith healer as well, but he is not certain about usefbiness (contributing 3). He later reported that the traditional Chinese hehalist was the one he first sought help hm and satisfied with (coatniuting 4), and the most Unportant and sa\u00ee\u00efs@hg source of help (contributing 4). Adding 301 al1 the contributions, 5+4+4+4=17, Mr. A gets the highest raiiking possible for the individual category of herbalist/traditionaI healer. For the individual category of fath healer, he only gets a ranking of 3, because he had indicated the Chinese herbalist as his current preference, fint and most important source of help. Thus, there is no further contribution from this category to the ranking . Data Reduction Due to the large number of variables which resulted in a small number of responses in each cell, data reduction was conducted to classify variables with related meanings into grouped variables for quantitative dyses and hypothesis testing. These summary scores of 26 individual help-seeking categories were sorted into 8 logical groupings to form the new clustered categories: hs-selfllay help, hs-western medicine, hs-mental Chinese medicine, hs-spiritual, hs-other, hs-referring physician (family doctor). For example, the clustered category hs-self\u00eflay help is made up of the sumrnary scores of the first 3 help-seeking individuai categories: hs-self care, hs-help at home, hs-fnends-relatives. The following table depicts the groupings of the clustered categories of helpseeking behaviour: Clustered Category # Clusterd Category HS # in EMIC Individual Category 1 SelfLay Help 1 Self Care General Health (western medicine) Mental Health Alternative Treatment Traditional Chinese Medicine Help at Home Friends-Relatives Dmg Store-Pharmacy General HospPubiic Specidist Health Education ktor (Nonspecific) Mental Health Professional Stress Management Massage Homeopathic Chiropractor (Chinese) Nutritionist Herbal-Td't Healer Meditation-Prayer Mer (Specify) This CIinic Clustered Scores Construction of Interval Scale of Prominence hnkings As showed in the data reduction section above, the 8 clutered categories are formed by grouping individual categories with related meanings. The following is the procedure to obtain the clustered perceived cause score (interval scale of prominence rankings): (1) Take the highest contribution among the individual categories within each clustered category, in response to openended questions (EMIC#47), as the contribution for the clustered category. (2) Take the highest contribution among the individuai categories witbin each clustemi category, in nsponse to the question of current preference as for most useful (EMIC #48), as the contribution for the clustered category. (3) Take the individuai category which is indicated as the nrSt help-seeking and most satisfied (EMIC #49) as the ones for the clustered category. (4) Take the individuai category which is hdicated as the most important and most satidied (EMIC #50) as the oms for the cIustend category. For example, Mr. A reported spontaneously that a Chinese herbalist was the source of help he had tried and found useful. Since herbalist is one of the individual category in the traditional Chinese medicine clustered category and 5 is the highest contribution, the ttaditional Chinese medicine clustered category gets this contribution. He also indicated that his '%ment\" preference for help-seeking was also this herbalist, because he found the practitioner most usehl (contnbuting 4). Again, the traditional Chinese medicine clustered category gets this contribution of 4. However, after probing, Mr. A., mentioned that he had tried a faith healer as well, but he is not certain about usefulness (contributing 3). Since the individual category of faith healer is part of the clustered category of spiritual, the clustered category of spiritual gets the contribution of 3. He later reported that the herbdist was the one he f' sought help from and satisfied with (contributing 4), and was aiso the most important and satisfying source of help (contributing 4). Adding ail the contributions, 5+4+4+4=17, Mr. A gets the highea ranking possible for the clustcred category of traditional Chinese medicine. For the clustered category of spiritual, he only gets a ranking of 3, kcause he had indicated a variable in the traditional Chinese medicine clustered category as the cmnt preference, first and moa important source of help. Furthemore, the contribution of a pmbing response is added only if no other help-seeking in the clustered category is rated spontaneous or most important. Thus, there is no mer contribution fiom the clustered category of spintual to the ranking. Source: Weiss, M. (1997). APPENDIX G: Computation of Self-Perceived Stigma Score There are twelve questions in the EMIC pertaining to self perceived stigma. These questions enquire concerns about disclosure of illness, diminished self-esteem, social rejections of self and family, especially with regard to negative influence on self and family's marriages. These questions, each represented a stigma variable, are rated on a 4-point scale (3=yes, 2=possible, l=uncertain, O=no). As showed in the table below, based on the subject's response to each of these variables, the higher numeric values indicated greater stigma These scores are then combined additively to form a stigma scale. The total score of stigma is the sum of stigma item 1 to stigma item 12. Scores on the scale range fiom O to a possible maximum of 36. Interna1 consistency of the stigma scaie for this has been verified with a Cronbach alpha of 0.8 14. Source: Weiss, M. (1 997). Sligrna# Variable Question # in EMlC EMlC Entry Score Contribution 1 Avoid Disclosure 2 Self-Esteem 3 Shame Others think less Others avoid you Others rehse to visit Others think less of farnily Problems for family 35 Family concern about disclosure 36 Problem to get married 37.1 Problem \u00een ongoing marriage 37.2 Problem for relative to marry 373 APPENDIX H: General lllness Beliefs Epilepsy Perceived Cause The majocity (29 or 58%) of the participants cited heredity as the cause of epilepsy, 22% (1 1) physical causes such as neurological problems, viral infection and injury; 8% (4) blamed a congenital problem, for example a pregnant woman would render her mbom child susceptible to epilepsy if she ate mutton during her course of pregnancy; 6% (3) alleged social stresses (unpleasant life events) 4% (2) reported psychologicd distnss (over worries), and one participant (2%) attributed his fatigue to \"*uo\" (weakness). They felt that most people in the community would share their opinion, only \"some uneducateci\" people would consider the person suffering fiom epilepsy as being possessed by demons or ghosts. The following is the view towards epilepsy of a 43-yearsld female participant, who was a graduate of a prominent US univeaity and former school teacher fiom Hong Kong: It is a genetic illness. My sister-in-lw has epilepsy, and my husband f niece. his brother 's daughter fias epilepsy .... This gene is inherited fium my father-in-lm My sister-in-lm has epilepsy and she has several episodes of seinves befor .... This niece also hm it. Other people would not think it is heredity, they would say that it wu being processed by devil or due to bad deedpom previous generation thar affected their chikdren. Epilepsy is not an ordinary illness. The person would have seiwes and secretion fiom the nourh. It was a scary scene. (# 1 9) Stigma Ninety percent (90% or 45) of the participants indicated that if others were to know about someone having epilepsy, it wouid cause problems for this person and even hider family, 4% (2) said possibly and only 6% (3) nported no. Sudy-six percent (66% or 33) claimed the havhg epilepsy wodd fcel asbamed of baving it, 12% (6) said possibly and ody 22% (1 1) reported no. 307 A 52-year-old laboratory technician fiom China told of the case of his uncle's son who has epilepsy : Not oniy he (cousin) h\u00e0mselffinds it very embarrassing, he is having dzJ\u00eerculties in making Rien& orfinding a job. diflwlties in every respect. His family is very bothered by this too. (#32) Having epilepsy meant not only major impact on the patients' but also their \"blood-related\" relatives' chances of getting married. Therefore, \"befoe marriage it is important to imtestigate that the relatives of the person does indeed not have epilepsy\" (#3, a 28-yearsld mother of two), and some would \"objecr ifmy drnghter is going to many a person with epilepsy\" (#50, a 42- year-old mother of tbree). Seventy eight percent (78% or 39) of the participants said that they would be concerned if someone who bas epilepsy were to marry into their family, 10% (5) indicated possibly and only 12% (6) said no. Eighty percent (80% or 40) of the participants suggested that most people would be concemed if someone who had epilepsy were to marry into their family, 12% (6) reported possibly, 6% (3) uncertain and only one participant (2%) said no. A 52-year-old former university professor fiom Shanghai voiced the sentiment of the majority and explained the potential social impact of epilepsy on its victim and family: It is embarrassing and shaniefilfor the family. People will look down on the family. Especiully in China when people know thisperson has epilepsy in the family history, tlhey tend to avoid thut person, let alone gel mmied with that person It is imposs\u00e0ble. No. not even to socialize with this person. In China, it is alrnost a tubooO It is the &nd of @ople who have the) illness everybo\u00e0y would keep a distance fiont, because when it (seizure) happem. it is uncontrollable. 1 is very dzpcuItfir the fdily. Also, ifpeople have better options, they will no? choose a person with epilepsy to marry. (#20) This feeling was echoed by a substantial nmkr of as 46% (23) reprted that should others know about an individual's epiiepsy. It would be dificult for relatives of this person to marry; 20% (10) noted possibly, and just 34% (17) said no, this was not mie. Respondents purported that victims of epiiepsy usdy fonnulate seategies to combat the stigma assoeiated with the illness. A 4\u00fb-yea~ld &tory worker hm China meaied: I know of a person, o boy, he had to rnany someone fion far away. His w fe did not how about this ut the time of nrarriage. Afler the marriage, she had no choice. They even hd two children. W9) The majority (78% or 39) of participants would not refuse to visit the home of a penon with epilepsy, one (2%) said possibly, 9 (18%) would refuse and one (2%) individual was not certain. AIthough visiting the home of an epileptic usually did not pose a problem for most infonnants, and most recognized that \"epiiepsy is not an infectiour diseare,\" they would proceed with caution: I would still go to his house. but I will not say anything that can excite him, because I heard that epilepsy can be triggered by any kind of excitement (or stress). Therefore, cannot talk to him anything that is excitable. You can be piend still. (# 1 5) The majority (62% or 31) also felt that most people would not refuse to visit the epilepsy patient's home, 3 (6%) said possibly most people would not refuse, 5 (10%) said that most people would refuse and one (2%) individual was not certain. A large proportion (82% or 41) of the participants revealed that most people with a relative who has epilepsy would prefer to keep othen from knowing about it if they could, 10% (5) reported possibly, and only 8% (4) said no because they felt that other people could not help the patient if they did not know about it. Some felt that to avoid disclosure is the \"general attitude of most Chinese\" (#38) and that '>ou do have to rnind the face of the person with epilepsy\" (#47), especially the nature of the illness allows them to bide it fiom others. A 56-year-old business man who ha\u00e2 a sister with epilepsy explained: People wiii try their best mot to let others know. No one wants to be si& she look nod most of the time, and it just hoppened den&, she can 'i help it and it (seiwes) act p al1 the tirno. rit (seimres) hrp>pens al1 the time and har to lie in bed all the Me, then you can 't keep othersfiom knowing abow it. When it (seinaes) doesn 't act up, she is a normal person. so there is no point to tel2 others about it. (#43) 309 One of the major reasons for wanting to keep the illness fkom others was because having epilepsy would reflect poorly on the fiunily. This sentiment was shared by a substantial number of participants; 42% of them (2 1 ) reported that if someone had epilepsy and others came to know about, that it would reflect poorly on the family, 26% (13) suggested possibly, and 32% (16) said no, it would not. The following is a quote nom a 46-year-old married man fiom Hong Kong. He explained how epilepsy was considered shamefiil not only to the patients but also to their family memben, and described the Chinese cultural proscriptions against sharing such information with others: We, Chinese, would prefr nobody knows about it. As the saying goes, \"Family shame do not go spreuding outside.\" Even things thut are not very shamefil, we still don? want people to know. If other people knew, it would distress the family. Even ifthe neighbours know, some people have \"long tongues\" flike to gossip], they will tell others th this person hm epilepsy, or even pointing fingers when they see the person It would also affect the chance of marriage of his family, because it is hereditary. (# 1 5) Heip-Seeking Behaviour Due to the unpredictable nature of epilepsy, some respondents felt that the immediate action at the tirne of a seizure is to \"(hurry) to find some green vegetabie und put it into his mouth\" (#20, a 52-year-old former University professor !tom Chine). Family physicians were the help of choice by 52% (16 suggested patient's own family doctor and 10 said any general practitionea would do) of the participants to treat epilepsy, self-help and help fiom family and fneads were suggested by 22% (Il), other Westem medicine speciaiists, such as neurologists, were recornmended by 20% (IO), traditional Chinese medicine practitioners were suggested by 6% (3) of the informants. The reason wby most respondents preferred seeking help hm Western medicine was captured by a 43-year-old former nmhg teacher hm Hong Kong: 3 10 Chung-i (iraditional Chinese medicine doctor, herbalist) lack concrete investigation equipnient and there is no standard of their practice. They are not covered by OHIP so I would take the person to see a Western doctor, a specialist. (Mg) One of the three participants who mandated seeing a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, also proposed other measures probably reflected opinions of older and less educated Chinese individuals. A 64-year-old unemployed cook who immigrated hm China suggested: Go see a Chung-i (traditions[ Chinese medicine doctor. herbalis\u00ee) and seek help fini a knowledgeable person Iike an elder who probably will suggest to eut the gallbladder of afix or a beur. ifyou have nioney, you con mak the fax skin into a mat and Wear it. It can get rid of the windpom one's body. (# 1 3) Depression Perceived Cause The majority (27 or 54%) of the participants cited psychological problems, such as wony, boredom and penonality, as causes of depression, 36% (18) reported causes of social nature (such as personal or financial losses, bereavement, interpersonal codicts and impact of migration), 4% (2) suggested weakness and 3 othea thought it was caused by a physical problem such as postpartum hormonal imbalance, hendity, and fate respectively. Thirty two percent (32% or 16) refused to speculate about what other people in the community would consider as the cause of depression. Those who responded professed that other people in the comrnunity shed their point of view. The opinion of a 47-year-old mother who cesigneci from her factory job to care for her 20- year-old schizophrenic son represents the thoughts of those participants who claimed a psychologid cause to depression: These people (\u00eehose with depression) ~CSU(I~& haw rn inttovert a lot. People who camf iuindepressure andcannot let things go. (ml) 311 Respondents who nported a social cause to depression told tales of acquaintaaces who expenenced the negative impact of migration. A 46-yeat-old man illustrated the misfortune of a fnend who suffered from depression: I hm a fiiend who has depression Her husband wap employed in Hong Kong. AAfr he brought his wge and chikiren to Canada, he was not able toj\u00eend work in Canada. The husband rehvned to Hong Kong and lefi the wife here. They had bought a house, a townhouse. He leJi his wife and children here und returned to Hong Kong by hinseK His wije was not able to f\u00bbrd work either and relied on him to send money fiom Hong Kong. His wife rented out the basement of the house to twu students. His wife hd to cook for the two students as well. Of course. she charged them for the nieals, but the husband was not very understanding to the wife. The wife ofien wondered why the family had to live that way and not living together, and that led to her depression. (# I 5) Stigma The majority (60% or 30) of the participants said that if others were to know about someone having depression, it wouid cause problem for this person, 12% (6) reported possibly, 2% (1) uncertain and 26% (13) said no, it would not cause a problem. Lack of understanding of the illness by the general public was cited as one of the reasons that wodd cause problems. A 53- yearsld female unemployed sewing machine operator specdated: It wifl bring some discrimination to that person. Othei-s mcry misinterpret depression as being crazy, people get mixed up and think tht you hadpsychiatric illness. (M7) This comment aiso ceflects most participants' attitude towards depression: unlike schizophrenia, depression is considered an emotional distress not a serious psychiaeic illness. A little less than one third (32% or 16) of the interviewees indicated afl\u00efrmatively that the person who SUners hm depression wouid feel ashamed should their condition be known by others, and 24% (12) specdated that it was possible that one wouid feel ashamd Forty percent (4M or 20) expd that the person kving depression wodd not feel ashamed of having this 312 condition while 4% (2) stated that they were not certain. One way to cope with this situation was to keep others fkom knowing about the problem to avoid psychological \"bad effects\" on the depressed person \"when others are gossiping about this\" (#34, a 30-year-old sectetary). More than half (58% or 29) of the participants said that they would be concemed if someone who had depression were to marry into their family, 26% (13) nported possibly and only 16% (8) said no, it would not cause them concern. The majority (60% or 30) also suggested that most people would be concemed if someone who has depression were to marry into their family, 28% indicated (14) that this was possibly so, 2% (1) uncertain and 5 participants (10%) repurted no, there would be no concern. The feeling of not wanting to be married to a person with depression evolved fiom the concem about this person's ability to Mfdl 52- yearsld former univenity professor fiom China explained: People would wonder how this person with depression would be able to work as a normal person and support the family. Yi want to do this, she feels depressed and if1 want to do that, the person would be depressed as well. Ifl want to have sex, this person might not want to do it. Al2 these might lead to a lot ofproblems in the mam-age. (#20) The majority (74% or 37) of the participants would not mind visiting the home of a person with depression, 5 (10%) stated that most likely they would not refuse, and 8 (16%) confvmed that they would refuse to visit the home of a person with depression. The majority (66% or 33) also felt that most people would not refuse to visit the depressed person's home, 7 (14%) conjectured that possibly most people would not tek, 9 (18%) held that most people would refuse and one (2%) individual was uncertain. Although most felt that people would not mind visithg the home of a depressed person, they had the foIIowing explaiiation for people who preferred not to visit, as a 47-year-old fede former ceceptionist at a fdly doctor's office No one shoufd think less of him unless he cannot control hinaseIfand is very abnormal. In this case, most Chinese will not visit him. The enthuriastic people may still visit him und will not think less of him. For others who do not how him, they will not visit him (#44) The majotity (64% or 32) of the participants said that rnost people with a depressed relative preferred to keep others fiom knowing about the illness if they could, 18% (9) indicated possibly, and 18% (9) answered no, it did not concern them if others knew. Over a third (34% or 17) concurred that if someone has depression and others corne to know about it it wouid reflect poorly on the family, 24% (12) suggested possibly, 40% (20) reported no that would not be me, and one (2%) was uncertain. Like most other interviewees, a 38-year-old female Former Fashion design teacher from Hong Kong felt that this kind of thinking is central to the Chinese culture: Since Chinese are very conservative and try to keep others fiom knowing their family shme. Chinese have this Rind of thinkifig. (#3 8) Only 22% (1 1) confirmed that if others were to know about an individual's depression that it would make it dificult for relatives of this person to get rnarried. Twelve percent (12% or 6) stated that this was possible. The majority (66% or 33) felt that it should not bave an effect, becaw as immigrants most patients did not have people fiom the same community living close enough to learn about their illness. A 40-year-old man fiom China clarified: It would not be o problem in Canada but it will cause probiems to the family in China since people live close by. In Canada, you do not even ktow your neighbours so it does not rnatter. W9) 314 Most of the participants (54% or 27) suggested that farnily members should care for the patient with depression. Mental health professionals were the choice of help of 16% (8), while 10% (5) chose general practitioners, 8% (4) self-care, help fiom relatives and fiiends were suggested by 6% (3), 2% (1) recommended group therapy, 2% (1) indicated that \"nothing can help\", and 2% (1) could not tell what would be helpful. The following two quotations captured the opinions of most interviewees: I think that the family has to help the person for as long as they can manage at home, but ifthey con? manage any longer, the jirst thing they should do is to send the person to a Western doctor. (#1,44-year-old widow, mother of four) Communicate with the fumiiy. (Seek help fiom) Doctors, psychologist, psychiatrist (in this order). Only when one gets to be suicida1 or harmfil to others, then one should see a doctor. But the family should provide support at first. (#12, 44-yearsld single male, psychology graduate fiom an Ontario university and working as a clerk at a post office.) Schizop hrenia Perceived Cause The majority (32 or 64%) of the participants attributed social problems (major personal or fuuuicial losses, tragic life events and interpersonal conflicts) as the causes of schizophrenia, or \"wires stuck\" as most participants would refer to it in Chinese colloquial language. Heredity was reported by 26% (13). Causes of psychological nature such as personality and worry were suggested by 6% (3) of infonnants. One claimeci that it is congenital and anothet thought it was caused by a physical problem such as a biochemical abnormality in the btain. We 18% (9) refused to speculate what other people in the\u00f9 community would consider as the cause of schkophrenia, most felt that other peuple shed their opinions. 315 Many participants emphasized that schizophrenia was caused by serious social matters and not j ust minor events. A 46-year-old man who was working as a subway supervisor illustrated: Schizophrenia is usually due to sudden changes, wch as in 1987, the stock market crashe4 someone who had invested. say he traded margins, that rnight involved (loss CI$ millions of dollars and it was no way out for him. He might have a few hundred thousand dollars and he could mortgage his house, it war no way he couid puy his debt. Might be at thal moment he could Mer a nervous breakdown. then lead to schizophrenia. (# 15) Stigma The majority (78% or 39) of the participants affirmed that if others were to know about someone having schizophrenia, it would cause problem for this person, 8% (4) suggested possibly, and 14% (7) reported no, that it would not. The same man cited above explained why it would cause problems for the victim of schizophrenia: I think the person would suffer great distress ifpeople knew, because it is madness. As a victim, he would sufer a lot of discrimination. Because being a schizophrenic, even parents with young children in kindergarten would say (to their children) \"don5 get close to this person because he is mad \" People would have nothing tu do with him, and absolutely not mars, him. Even ifyou say that I am too con\u00eeewative, I would never associate with him. (# 1 5) Many respondents agreed that even were the person to recover fkom schizophrenia they would still be treated differently: \"ln Chinese society, fa person was mad befire, other people would be scared of him. What if this person becomes aggressive again? \" (#32, 52-year-old unemployed biochemist from China). A former schimphnic would not be trusted again by others as explained by this 28-yearsld business man who had studied cornputer science in an Ontario University: He may be crazy again although he is cured Jwt lik a car, once it has brokn dom you would wonder ift would be worse shdd i\u00ee break down again. (W2) The majority (60% or 30) indicated that the pason who was dering hm schizophrenia wouid feei ashamed of having this condition, eqd numbers (20% or 10) of infonaants reportod 3 16 no or possibly. Many of them blamed the Chinese culture for the high level of shame experienced by schizophrenic patients and families even the patient recovered hm the illness. As explained by a 27-year-old unemployed engineer fiom Hong Kong: People would accept sorneone who had his leg broken and healed but people would not accept sonteone who had schizophrenia and recovered I do not how why, I guess il ir jurt Chinese tradition. I tend to think that way too. (#8) A 53-year-old unemployed sewing machine operator fiom China echoed the thoughts of most participants that other people knowing about the illness would subject the patient and family to lose face. The familj will lei others know unless they are very close. Avoid outsiders knowing about this because the famiiy will [ose face ifthey do. (#47) A large proportion (80% or 40) of the participants claimed that they wouid be concemed if someone who had schizophrenia were to marry into their family, 12% (6) reported no, it would not be a problem, and 8% (4) suggested possibly. An overwhelming majority (84% or 42) of the participants agreed that most people would be concerned if someone who had schizophrenia were to marry into their family, 8% (4) purported possibly, 3 (6%) participants said no and one was (2%) uncertain. Again, most informants blamed the Chinese culture for the stigma attached to schizophrenia, as understood by a 27-year-old unemployed engineer from Hong Kong: People would not want to nrarry into such a fmily neither and Iguess Chinese tradition tells us not to have anything to do with these people. (#8) For those who considered the cause of schizophrenia as the cesult of heredity (26% or 13 of the participants), they claimed that schizophrenia would affect the fdly for three generations. Therefore, if one contemplated marriage, one must trace back thne generations of one's potentiai spouse to ensure that scbpbrenia was not in this person's femily history. A 53-year-old fornier Engiish teacher hm Hong Kong expleiwd: Since it is hereditury. II is possible, according to Chinese belie/, one can inherit the illnessfor three generatiom. (#30) Most (62% or 3 1) of the participant wouid not refuse to visit the home of a person with schizophrenia, 4 (8%) most possibly they would not refuse, and 15 (30%) would refuse. Commenting that other people in their community were not as open minded as they were, oniy 48% (24) respondents considered most people would not refuse to visit the home of a schizophrenic patient, 8% (4) suggested that possibly moa people would not refuse, and 44% (22) speculated that most people would refuse because of the unpredictable nature of the illness, where the patient would become aggressive without waming (#20). A 27-year-old female univenity graduate fiom China who worked as a secretary at a cornputer store confided that understanding the iliness allowed her to visit her fnend who suffered fiom schizophrenia without fear : I have a fiiend who has schizophrenia It is a troublesome illness. I understand the s@ring she hm gone through. mer people are ahid cfher but I still visit her. (#7) Another woman recounted a homfic experieace she had with schizophrenia, and confessed that she wouid never get physically close to anyone with the illness: One of my older relatives had schizophrenia and he was in the newspaper. I was still young at that tinte. He kaed 8people in his fami&. Iam terri/ed with this kind of illness. (#30) Alrnost aii participants (94% or 47) conf\u00efnned that most people with a relative who had schizopknia prefened to keep othea fiom knowing about it if bey could, 4% (2) said possibly, and only one (2%) ceportcd no, people wodd not keep this quiet. The following comment of a 42-yearsld male welder hm China captured the opinion of most participants, that of having other people know about their ihess would -te more suBering for the patient: 318 I will not let people krow because this may create more pressure on the patient. He does not wunt to have this disease and have others look down ut him. (#22) The majotity of interviewees (64% or 32) also reported that if someone had schizophrenia and others came to know about it, it would reflect poorly on the family, 16% (8) speculated that this was possible, and 20% (10) said no. A 38-year-old female former fashion design teacher explained: Since others will gossip thut so and so S son or daughter is \"wire-stuck \" (cruq), and the fmily wou\u00eed be disrressed andfeel the pressure. (#38) Almost half of the informants (46% or 23) said that should others know about an individual's schizophrenia, it would make it difficult for relatives of this persoa to get mmied, 14% (7) said possibly; this is especidly so for participants who felt the cause of schllophrenia was heredity \"It will affect the chance of marriage of relatives since fhis illness is hereditary\" (#45, a 49-year-old sewing machine openitor fiom China). Close to half of the participants (40% or 20) suggested that it would not make it difficult for relatives of this person to get married, because the illness was related to the occurrence of tragic events beyond the victirn's control. Help-See king Bebaviour Most of the participants (40% or 20) felt that mental health professionals' help should be sought, while 30% (15) demanded that family memkrs or relatives should care for the person who sufEer hm schiaophrenia. General practitioners were the choice of help for 28% (14) of the infamants, and one of them suggested a neurologist should see the patient A 27-yearsld unemployed engineer summid the views of rnost @cipants with regard to helping the patient dering km schizophrenia as follows: The fimily should know what his problems ore.

Take him to a doctor so that he can get medication. 1 think public education about what the illness is, is also very important. \u00efhat's the on& way to help gef these people Wtients) accepted into society. (# 8) Cornparison of the Participants' Views on Epilepsy, Depression and Schizophrenia The table below depicts a comparison of quantitative responses of the participants' views on epilepsy, depression and schizophrenia. The first row indicates their opinions on perceived causes, rows 2 to 10 on stigma, and the last row on helpseeking behaviour. Perceived Cause The participants attributed different perceived causes to epilepsy, depression and schizophrenia. However, some of them pointed out that these illnesses were caused by some comrnon factors. For example, epilepsy (58% of the participants) and schizophrenia (26%) were considered to result from heredity, while schizophrenia (64%) and depression (18%) were regarded to be caused by social dificulties. Over half (53%) of the respondents cited a psychological cause for depression, but oaly a number of inte~ewees felt that psychological problems contributed to epilepsy (4%) or schizophrenia (6%). Stigma The majority of the iaformants felt that for patients SUffering fkom one of the three illnesses, if other people learnt of theu illnesses, this would create problems and would make them feel ashamcd; especially in epilepsy (a relatively more visible illness) accounting for 90% and 66%, in schizophrenia 78% and 60%, and depression encornter pmblems in getthg married, in comparison with epileptic (78%) and depressive patients (58%). Moreover, they stated that people in theu community would shate their opinions (schizophrenia, 84%, epilepsy, 8WA, depression, 60%) Ui this regard. As for home visits, most of the participants wouid visit the homes of these patients, 320 particularly those of the epileptic (78%) and depressive (74%) patients, while the willingness to cal1 on schizophrenic patients (62%) was slightly less. Besides, they indicated that people in their comrnunity generally would share their view, but would be comparatively less willing than they to go to these patients' homes (depressive, 66%, epileptic 62%), particularly those of the schizophrenic patients (48%). The participants felt strongly that patients with schizophrenia (94%) or epilepsy (83%) would avoid disclosure of their illnesses, while the avoidance of depressive patients would be of a lesser degm (64%). As for the effects of the illness on the family, the majority of the respondents (64%) dleged that schizophnia would reflect poorly on the family, but less than half (42%) felt that epilepsy or depression (34%) would have the same effect. Furthemore, a substantiai number (40%) even said that depressive patients would not reflect poorly on their families. As the effects on relatives' marriage are concemed, slightiy less than half (both 46%) claimed that with an epileptic or a schimphrenic patient at home, it would be dificult for the relatives to get married, but 66% maintained that patients sutTering fiom depression wouid not affect their relatives' chance of marriage. Help-Seeking: Behaviour More than half (52%) of the participants asserted that epileptic patients should seek help fiom family physicians, while the percentage for schuophrenic patients was 28 and that for depressive patients was 10. The majority expressed that the depressives (68%) would turn to families and fnends for help, but a smaller number felt that schizophrenic (30%) or epileptic (22%) patients would do so. Mental health professionais werc cited by a fall number of the participants as the help of choice for schizophrenia (40%) and depression (1 8%)' but none of the participants suggested that epileptic patients should seek help hm this source. 321 Quantitative Findiiigs of Participants' Geneml Illncss Beliefs on Epilepsy, Depression and Sc hizo phrenia. 1.
