Following up on this study ( [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32466231/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32466231/)), I'm experimenting more with Taurine dosage pre fasted cardio. The study pertains to 15 mins of moderate cardio, I'm doing 45 minute sessions, so it only somewhat applies. What I've noticed is that my energy level is more of a slow drip for the first X minutes and then I get a second wind where my power output is much higher. My hypothesis is that I'm burning mostly fat during the first section and then the taurine wears off and my body switches to glycogen for its primary fuel. The study notes that lipid oxidization didn't vary between 3g taurine and 6g taurine, so it's likely that more taurine = longer duration of lipid oxidization, NOT higher % burned, and both 6g and 3g were sufficient for 15 minutes of exercise. Since I'm doing more than 15 minutes and taurine is generally extremely safe, I want to push the dosage. I did 6g for a few days where I would feel the 'fat burning' range was about 25-30 mins, I'm on 8g now where the 'fat burning' lasts for closer to 35-40 mins with 0 side effects so far. The literature on taurine at high doses is pretty nonexistent except that 'there are no side effects for under 6g per day for a month.' I'm 2 weeks into a 12 week cut, so I have 10 more weeks of this. So I ask: does anyone have experience or literature on "}
