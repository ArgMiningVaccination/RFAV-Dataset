Ravi, Mada, Surendra and have herbal massage parlour- ''Saptharishi Rejuvenation and Massage Centre\" and it is said to be the first massage parlour set up the tribal youths. Trained in Ayurveda and para-medicine at the Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement Ayurvedic Hospital in Kenchanahalli village in HD Kote, these youths decided to make a living out of it and this led them to starting the parlour. All of them did their schooling from SVUM, a semi-residential school meant only for the tribal children at Hosahalli inside the forest area. Ravi, the brain behind this venture, said the main reason for starting this parlour is to provide quality service to the customers at an affordable price and also to protect and popularise the rich tribal culture of preparing medicines from the herbs which are available in the woods. \"Earlier, every household used to prepare medicines from the herbs. But now, only a few age old tribal men have this knowledge. If we don't protect it, it will vanish soon\", he said. He said, he and his friends have a plan to conduct a study on the medicinal herbs and plants available in the region and publish a book about them and their uses. "}
