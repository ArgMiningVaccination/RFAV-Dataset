While seventy-five percent of women experience hot flashes and night sweats during perimenopause and menopause men, young women, and children can also experience them for varying reasons. What Causes Hot Flashes? While medical experts may not prescribe the same treatments, most agree that hot flashes in menopausal women are the result of an imbalance of hormones, which sends messages to the brain that the body needs to cool off. The symptoms can be triggered\u2014day or night\u2014by many things, including eating spicy foods, cigarette smoke, alcohol, caffeine, feelings of stress, being in a hot room or car, or wearing winter clothes, especially around the neck. But there are other possible causes that include side effects of certain medications, diabetes, obesity, infections, thyroid disorders, adrenal gland disease, autoimmune illnesses, gluten-intolerance, food allergies, cancer, chemotherapy, sleep disorders, pregnancy, and drug or alcohol withdrawal. Natural Remedies for Hot Flashes and Night Sweats Regardless of the cause, disruptive bouts of hot flashes and night sweats can leave you feeling fatigued, and in much need of relief. Try the following: - Go with the right sheets. Microfiber or sateen sheets aren't a good choice. Try 100% cotton percale sheets. - Try cotton. Wear breathable cotton or thin pajamas rather than flannel and heavy socks. - Lower the thermostat. Sleeping in a cooler room rather than a warmer one promotes restful sleep. - Try a cooling pillow which can be helpful to those prone to hot flashes and night sweats.
