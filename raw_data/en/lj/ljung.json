INTRODUCTION 1.1. Adherence Chronic diseases, defined as diseases with a lo ng, indefinite duration and little prospect of immediate change, are considered to be a major future health care challenge 1. Having a chronic disease often implies life-long therapy in order to prevent or delay progression of the disease. Obviously, th e effectiveness of therapies depends on patients' level of adherence. Adherence to the therapy is therefore a cornerstone requirement of successful chronic illness management 2. Adherence (also called compliance or concordance) can be defined as \u00ab the extent to which a person's behaviour - taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider \u00bb 3. It \u00ab is a behavioral process, strongly influenced by the environment in which the patient lives, including the health care practices and systems. Adherence assumes that a patient has the knowledge, mo tivation, skills and resources required to follow the recommendations of a health care professional.\u00bb 4 1.2. Adherence in transplantation Solid organ transplant recipients are chroni cally ill patients, because the transplantation did not fully eliminate the need for medical treatment. Recipients have to adhere to a life long medication regimen that prevents the immune system from rejecting the transplant and manages emerging co-morbidities 5 6 7. Reduceing the risk for rejection requires a high degree of adherence to th e prescribed immunosuppressive. However, despite the dangers related to imperfect adherence, previous research has shown that a substantial proportion of solid organ reci pients fail to take their immunosuppressives as prescribed. An estimated 20 to 25% of the adult heart, liver and renal transplant patients are non-adherent to their immunosuppressive therapy 7. Non-adherence is expected to cause 20% to 90% of late ac ute rejections and 16% to 23% of graft losses in solid organ transplant recipients 7. Furthermore, the non-adherence problem is expected to be one of the causes for yet unexplained but observed stagnation in long-term kidney graft survival 8. Economic consequences are a higher cost per quality adjusted life year 9. Improving outcomes in solid organ transplantat ion is considered to be one of the main goals in transplant research and clinical management of transplant patients for the upcoming years 10. A possible strategy to reach that goal is to enhance adherence in patients. A prerequisite to enhancing adherence is that patients at risk for non-adherence can be identified, which implies that studies are needed that unveil risk factors of adherence behavior. Risk factor s for non-adherence are manifold. In 2003, the WHO published a taxonomy of risk factors of non-adherence (see figure ) 3. Risk factors in this model can be socio-economic , therapy-, patient-, condition-, and health care system- or health care worker-related . Adherence research has primarily focused on socio-economic, patient-, condition- and treatment-related factors. The WHO framework aims at directing attention to ri sk factors from all adherence-determining dimensions including health care related factors 3. As the main aim of this research program is to investigate risk factors fo r non-adherence to immunosuppressive drugs Introduction 8 in kidney transplant patients, the WHO mo del will be used as a guiding framework in this dissertation. Fig. 3. WHO framework: the five dimensions of non-adherence 1.3. Measurement of non-adherence A prerequisite for quantitatively investigatin g adherence behavior is that adherence can be assessed in a valid way. Unbiased methods are needed that capture non-adherence in its sub-clinical stage (i.e. before recu rrent rejections or graft loss suggest non- adherent behavior). Several measurement me thods exist, recently concisely discussed in a review article published in the New England Journal of Medicine 11. Measurement methods relevant for solid organ transplantation can be divided into two groups: direct or indirect measures. Direct measures , i.e. observation of medication intake and biological assay of drug levels or drug metabolites in the blood or ur ine, permit examining actual drug ingestion 11 12. Observation is a very labor-intensive meth od, not feasible in non-clinical settings, and thus not very common in transplantation research. Blood assay on the other hand is used more frequently in routine c linical practice to assess levels of immunosuppressive. A disadvantage of assay is that it does not capture intake dynamics and that \"white coat-compliance\", referring to patients taking their medication before a clinic visit in which a blood sample will be taken, may bias the results. Indirect measures do not prove actual intake of the medication; rather, they estimate how much patients could have ingested base d on information coming from patient self- reports or diaries, collateral reports from family members or clinicians, rates of prescription refills, pill counts, or electronic monitoring (EM). The advantage of most of these indirect methods (except for EM) is that they are relatively easy to use, often at the expense of a lower sensitivity or validity 11 12. This, however, does not apply to EM 13 14. EM is a technologically advanced method, which relies on microprocessor equipped pill packages or bottles that register their opening times to assess adherence behavior. EM is today's most sensitive adherence measure 15. It measures adherence Introduction 9 with great resolution, and unveils not only th e taking dimension but also the temporal dynamics of medication taking. For resear ch purposes, EM became the assessment method of choice over the last years. This does not mean, however, that EM is the perfect method. Despite its nice diagnostic properties, many researchers are reluctant to declare EM the gold standard method in adherence research, as EM's alleged superiority has not really been thoroughly substantiated in research yet 11. In an recent editorial contribution elaborating on th e validity of non-adherence measurement methods, DiMatteo, an authority in the area of adherence, therefore included EM among the methods that need to be scrutinized in future research: \" To obtain a firmer grip on the best measurement methodolog ies, it will be necessa ry to compile and assess the value, appropriaten ess, reliability, and validity of a wide range of possible measurement strategies. [...] Our findings about the prevalence, correlates, and consequences of nonadherence will always be tied to the methods we use, so we must understand them better.\" \"Research is needed that carefully examines measurement and methodology issues, including numerous adherence measurement strategies such as [...] electronic monitoring. \" 16 Because the main study of this dissertatio n will use EM as a measurement method for non-adherence, we will comply with DiMatteo's call by includ ing a section on validity of EM measurement. 1.4. Outline of the research program This dissertation consists of four chapters, of which the first two prepare the reader for the two main risk factor studies de scribed in the last two chapters. The literature review presented in chapter one summarizes the evidence on the prevalence, determinants, clinical and economic consequences of non-adherence with immunosuppressive drugs in renal transpla nt patients. A literature search, which yielded 38 articles was used to calculate 1) weighted mean prevalences of non- adherence and 2) weighted mean prevalences of rejection episodes or graft losses that can be attributed to non-adherence. In addition, economic co nsequences of non- adherence will be reviewed. Investigated risk factors of non-adherence will be summarized using the WHO framework, and suggestions are made for further research. Chapter two summarizes existing knowledge about the validity of electronic medication monitoring. A framework systematizing sources of bias in EM assessment is presented. The framework discerns internal and external assumptions underlying unbiased EM measurement. Internal validity assumptions presuppose (1) correct functioning of the EM equipment, (2) correspondance between EM-bottle openings and actual intake of the prescribed doses, and (3) absense of influence of EM on a patient's normal adherence behavior. External validity refers to EM biasing the representativeness of the sample. The four validity assumptions were tested using data from the Supporting Medication Adherence in Renal Transplantation (SMART) study, which included 250 adult renal transplant patients whose adherence to immunosuppressive drugs was measured over a 3-month period by EM 17. Chapter three is a prospective study assessi ng prevalence and risk factors of non- adherence, using SMART study data. Adherence was measured by EM in 250 adult renal transplant patients. A number of sele cted socio-economic, therapy-, patient-, condition- and health care team-related risk factors were explored for association to Introduction 10 non-adherence. Longitudinal analysis tech niques were used that allowed including time-varying covariables and fitting multivariable models. Chapter four addresses an underinvestigated area in risk factor research, i.e. health care team-related risk factors. More specifically, the study explored the relationship between the health care system and prevalence of self-reported non-adherence with immunosuppressives by focusing on variations in non-adherence prevalences between European and North American renal transplant patients. The study used methods of meta-analysis on individual patient data, combining three independent cross-sectional studies of comparable methodology that included patients from the US (N=1563) 18, the Netherlands (N=85), Belgium (N=187) 19 and Switzerland (n=342) 17.

Literature review: prevalence, consequences and determinants 14 2.1. Introduction Despite the introduction of powerful immunosuppressive agents and a continuous decrease of acute rejection episodes over the last decades, recent data show that long-term renal allograft survival only marginally improved. Indeed, graft survival in first transplants only increased by a mere 5 months between 1988 and 1995 1. In addition, overall graft survival remained at the same level between 1995 and 2000 2. This suggests that current therapeutic interventions do not efficiently prevent the development of chronic allograft nephropathy, which accounts for 40-50% of late allograft losses 3. Chronic allograft nephropath y is the consequence of any immunological (i.e. clinical or subclinical allograft rejection) or non-immunological injury (e.g. calcineurin-inhibi tor nephrotoxicity, hypertension, infections) to the renal allograft. The immunosuppressive therapy, which should be adapted to the needs of every patient, balances the risks for rejection and over-immunosuppression. Non-adherence with the immunosuppressive therapy is a behavioral factor that also needs to be scrutinized. Although non-ad herence is regarded as one of the major causes of late renal allograft failure 4, due to variability in exposure of the kidney to immunosuppressives 5-9, or simply by a discontinuation of drug intake 10 11, it only receives limited attention when discussing the etiology of graft loss in the literature 3 12 13. Understanding the behavioral dimension of transplant patients' management in view of prevalence, consequences and determinants of non-adherence with immunosuppressive drugs is a prerequisite for targeting non-adherence as a potential modifiable risk factor for poor outcome. The goal of this literature review is therefore to summarize the existing evidence on non-adherence with the immunosuppressive therapy in adult renal transplant recipients, more specifically to summarize and discuss: 1) measurement methods for assessing non-ad herence, 2) prevalence, 3) clinical as well as economical consequences, and 4) determinants of non-adherence. 2.2. The behavioral dimension of kidney transplantation The therapeutic regimen of renal transplant recipients consists of medication taking, infection prevention, smoking cessation, cl inic visit attendance, and of following guidelines concerning alcohol intake, diet and exercise. \"Adherence\", a key component of the behavioral dimension of transplant patient's therapeutic regimen, also called \"compliance\" or \"concordance\", refers to \"the extent to which a person's behaviour - taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with the agreed recommendations from a health care provider\" 14. Adherence with the immunosuppressive regime n can be measured by various direct and indirect methods. Direct methods refer to observation and assay of medications or medication by-products. Indirect methods incl ude self-report, pill count, prescription refills, collateral report, clinical outcome, and electronic moni toring (EM). EM refers to a pill bottle that contains a microprocessor fitte d cap to save the date and time of each opening 15. Despite the fact that the registration of a pill box opening does not prove ingestion, EM shows superior sensitivity compared to other methods, as shown in cross-validation studies 16. Moreover, EM allows assessing non-adherence as a continuous variable in a multidimensional ma nner (i.e. the taking and timing dimension of medication taking). Self-report often results in underreporting of non-adherence 16 17. Assay, despite being a direct method, on ly allows determining medication intake over a limited time period, depending on th e half-life of the drug. Also, \"white coat Literature review: prevalence, consequences and determinants 15 adherence\", referring to patien t's correct intake in the ligh t of a pending clinic visit, might further distort interpretation of therapeutic blood levels 18. We screened abstracts from the database of Medline, Cinahl and Psycinfo (1988-2004) f o r E n g l i s h , D u t c h , F r e n c h o r G e r m a n s t u d i e s f o c u s i n g o n p r e v a l e n c e , d e t e r m i n a n t s and consequences of non-adherence with i mmunosuppressive drugs in non-pediatric renal transplant patients, using the foll owing keywords: (kidney or renal) and transplan* and (adheren* or complian* or nonadheren* or noncomplian*). The Medline search yielded 569 abstracts, of which 34 focused on prevalence and/or consequences and/or determinants of nonadherence. Exploration of the reference lists yielded another four articles. The Cinahl and Psycinfo databases did not provide extra studies. 2.3. Prevalence of non-adherence Seventeen studies reported on prevalence of non-adherence with immunosuppressive drugs in kidney transplantation (Table 1). The prevalences of non-adherence varied widely, ranging from 2% to 67%, depending on the used operational definitions, case finding and measurement methods. A weighted mean prevalence, calculated over all studies that measured non-adherence by se lf-report, was 27.7% (n=10). One study, the only one measuring non-adherence by me dical chart review, found a very low non- adherence prevalence of 2%. Given the higher prevalences in other studies, chart review seems to lack sensitiv ity in capturing non-adherence 19. The fact that non- adherence is not assessed as a standard clinical para meter in most transplant programs may explain this low percentage. Two studies provided electronically monitored period prevalence estimates of non- adherence, using adherence parameters that express the taking and timing dimension of non-adherence 20 21. Although no clinical meaningful cut-off to classify patients in adherers and non-adherers in the renal tran splant population has been developed so far, these studies considered patients as being non-adherent if they had taken less than 90% of the prescribed doses, resulting in a 26% 21 and 20% 20 non-adherence prevalence. Future studies should define cu t-off values, indicating which level of non- adherence results in la te acute rejection or graft loss. Research in the heart transplant population already showed that minor deviatio ns from dosing schedule were associated with late acute rejections (> 1 year after transplantation) 22. This evidence about the prevalence of non-adherence with immunosuppressive regimen in renal transplantation indicates the widespread nature of the problem. To better understand the relevance of non-ad herence, its relation with poor outcomes (e.g. acute rejection episodes and allograft loss) needs to be explored. 2.4. Consequences of non-adherence Consequences of non-adherence can be categorized in clinical and economic consequences. Clinical consequences can be examined by assessing the effect of subclinical non-adherence on clinical outcomes , or by retrospectively looking for causes of acute rejections or graft losses.

Clinical consequences Fifteen studies examined the associatio n between subclinical non-adherence and clinical outcome 19 20 23-34. Three prospective cohort studies 20 23 32, one of which measured non-adherence electronically 20, demonstrated that non-adherence is a risk factor for late acute rejection and late graft loss (Table 2). These studies only took into account acute rejection and graft loss events if occurring after 3 months 20 32 or 1 year post-transplant 23. Ten retrospective cohort studie s, admittedly a weaker design, further confirmed the relationship between (late) acute rejection 24 25 29-31, graft loss/graft survival 19 26 28-30 34, patient survival 31, and graft dysfunction (defined as serum creatinine being 5mg/dl) 24. Two retrospective studies focusing on the relationship between non-adherence and chronic allograft nephropathy failed to find a direct link 31 35. However, it is worth noting that acute allograft rejection is the major risk factor for developing chronic allograft nephropathy 36 37. Given that non-adherence substantially contributes to late acute rejection 37, an indirect link between non- adherence and chronic allograft nephropathy can be suggested. Eighteen studies estimated the contribution of non-adherence in the etiology of graft losses and acute rejections, attributing up to 64% of the graft failures 27 28 34 38-49 and 80% of the late acute rejections to non-adherence 50 51, depending on case finding and measurement methods. Averaging these percentages by a weighted mean over the publications that met the me thodological requirement of having formally assessed non- adherence, resulted in an estimated contri bution of non-adherence to graft losses of 16.3% for graft losses (n=8), and to late ac ute rejections of 19.9% (n=3) (Table 3). These percentages probably underestimate the contribution of non-adherence in poor clinical outcome, as assessment of non-adherenc e in clinical practice rarely occurs in a routine and standardized way. Illustrative in this regard are the results of a study in a single heart transplant center that initially reported to the \"United Network for Organ Sharing\" database that non-adherence was the etiological factor in 2% of graft losses. Detailed reevaluation revealed that actually 13% of the graft losses were related to non-adherence 52. Given the contribution of non- adherence to the development of acute rejection and graft loss, it should be worthwhile to integrate a routine and standardized measurement of non-adherence in transplant registries or large outcome studies. Currently, categories such as \"a cute rejection\" or \"chronic allograft nephropathy\" mask non-adherence, resulting in underreporting of non-adherence as an important contributor to poor outcome 28. Also, since most studies assessing the relationship between non-adherence and outcome include patients on older im munosuppressants (e.g. azathioprine, cyclosporine), priority should be given in future research to assess if the found associations also apply for newer immuno suppressive regimens (e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, mycophenolate).

Patients also received adherence enhancing education before transplantation; US 196 Medical record report of: 1. Appointment non-adherence 2. Medication non-adherence: admission of patients/family Late acute consequences and determinants 25 2.4.2. Economic consequences Economic consequences of non-adherence have rarely been examined according to the best available standards for economic evaluation 53. One study estimated that the additional hospital cost associated with non-adherence amounts to 900$ per patient per year 54. This figure, however, incompletely reflects the actual costs, as non- adherence not only impacts upon hospital cost s but also on other cost categories, such as ambulatory care costs, nursing home ca re costs, productivity losses and patients' and their family's out-of-pocket expenses. To grasp the full economic impa ct of non-adherence, it is necessary to consider both costs and outcomes in a cost -effectiveness or cost-utility analysis. Non-adherence after renal transplantation may have two opposite consequences that make it difficult to determine a priori what its consequences will be on the cost-effectiveness of renal transplantation. On the cost side, non-adhe rence may entail additional costs due to the occurrence and consequent treatment of late acute rejection or graft loss. However, adherent patients may experience more negative side effects related to immunosuppressive medication intake that also require additional treatment. The balance between the costs of adherence and non-adherence then becomes blurred. On the outcome side, non-adherence - if deliberate - may increase patients' life satisfaction, for instance through the experien ce of less side effect s and more flexibility in medication intake. This quality of life im provement may (partly) offset the quality of life loss associated with increased morbidit y. Again, the net effect is unclear. Only one cost-utility study ha s assessed the economic cons equences of non-adherence in a renal transplant population. Cleemput et al. 55 found that because non-adherent patients have a lower life expectancy, their lifetime treatment costs are lower (a dead patient is the cheapest patient). Lifetime co sts for adherent patients were estimated to be 38 180 \u20ac higher than for non-adherent patients. As for the outcomes, non-adherent patients had a worse outcome than adherent patients in terms of both life expectancy and quality adjusted life expectancy. Both outcomes were summarised in a single outcome measure: Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). Adherent patients gained approximately 1.108 QALYs more after RTX than non-adherent patients 55. This implies that the incremental cost-effectiveness of adherence relative to non-adherence after RTX was 35 021 \u20ac/QALY. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio will ultimately determine the relative cost-effectiveness of adherence-enhancing interventions 55. For an adherence enhancing intervention to be cost-effective, it is important that its cost-effectiveness ratio, added to the cost-effectiveness ratio of adherence relative to non- adherence does not exceed the soci etal willingness to pay for a QALY. 2.5. Determinants of non-adherence Non-adherence can be considered as a phenomenon that emerges from the interplay of numerous influential factors, categorized into five groups: 1) socio-economic factors, 2) patient related factors, 3) condition or disease related factors, 4) therapy or treatment related factors, and 5) health care system and health care team related factors 14. Determinants from all categories except for health care system and health care team related factors have to a certain extent been studied in kidney transplant patients 19 21 23-25 27 29-31 34 35 51 56-61. The following section discu sses the findings of these studies. Table 4 summarizes the evidence from all performed prospective cohort studies 21 23 56. Literature review: prevalence, consequences and determinants 26 2.5.1. Socio-economic factors Socio-economic variables have been explored most often. Almost every study included the variable age, showing that non-adherenc e is nearly consistent ly associated with being younger 21 24 30 35 51 57-61. Studies failing to confirm th is finding mostly lack a significant subsample of adolescents 23 25 31 51. One could therefore hypothesize that the found linear association between non-adherence and younger age mainly depends on the presence of (non-adherent) adolescents at the lower end of the age spectrum. Without adolescents, non-adherence might rema in quite stable over the life course, at least before major cognitive, sensory an d functional impairment appear when becoming older. Facing the aging transplant population, increasing attention needs to be given to potential age related risk factor s. Further socio-econom ic factors related to higher non-adherence with immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation are social network variables 21 24 31 56 57 61. Non-adherence is associated with living alone 21 31, being unmarried 31 56 61, or perceiving low social support 62. Analyses investigating the factor education remain inconclusive 19 21 24 25 31 35 57 58 60 61, as some studies did not find any relation with non-adherence 19 21 25 31 35 57, while others found a positive 24 62, or a negative one 58 60 61. Likewise, socio-economic class 21 24 61 and gender 21 23-25 31 35 51 57 58 60 61 were not consistently relate d to non-adherence. In genera l, it can be stated that socio-economic factors alone, except for younger age and social isolation, show a limited association with non-adherence, in lin e with evidence from other chronic patient populations 14. 2.5.2. Patient-related factors Patient related factors refer to the resources, knowledge, attitudes, beliefs perceptions and expectancies of the patient 14. Patient related factors found to be associated with non-adherence with immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplantation are: low self- efficacy with medication intake 31, high levels of anxiety and hostility 60, and an external locus of control 57 60. External locus of control refers to patient's perception that the evolution of the disease is particul arly a matter of chance . Furthermore, health beliefs about the illness or the medication regimen such as believing that the immunosuppressive drugs are not needed to keep the kidney, or that intake of drugs may be delayed, have been found to be related to non-adherence 21 58. Knowledge about the regimen was positively related to non-adherence in two 25 31 out of three studies 25 31 56. One study investigated the predictive value of pre-transplant non- adherence on post-transplant non-adherenc e, finding also a significant positive relationship 30, in line with the evidence showing that past behavior very well predicts future behavior. Although a lot of studies in vestigated patient related correlates of non- adherence in renal transplant , few findings were mutually corroborated. Aside from replicating results, fu ture research could focus on exploring new possible determinants, such as busyness and routine in someone's life style, or engaging in health behaviors (e.g. vaccination). 2.5.3. Condition- or disease-related factors The condition or disease related variables depression 61 and dependency on nicotine 24 or on illegal drugs 19 24 showed a positive relationsh ip with non-adherence, whereas having diabetes was related to less medication non-adherence 58, perhaps due to the long-time adoption of adequate health behavior. Literature review: prevalence, consequences and determinants 27 2.5.4. Therapy- or treatment-related factors Therapy or treatment related factors such as time on dialysis, or being retransplanted were not associated with non-adherence 23 25 29 58 61. Three studies 59-61 out of 8 23 25 31 57-60 found more non-adherence in patients with a longer post-transplant status, confirming the evidence that duration of the regimen is associated with non- adherence. Other treatment related factors were the number of medications, a factor referring to the complexity of the medication regimen 25, and patients' subjective experiences of the symptoms related to side effects of medication (e.g. excessive hair growth, moon face) 58 60 63. Two studies 21 58 out of six 21 24 35 51 58 60 detected more non- adherence in recipients of a living donor graft, compared to cadaveric grafts. Future research could focus on the effect of the use of medica tion reminders (e.g. a pill organizer), changes in the medication regimen, pre-emptive transplantation, or the number of medication intakes per day on non-adherence. 2.5.5. Health care system- an d health care team-related factors The last category of determinants of non- adherence, health care system and health care team related factors has been studied fa r less, indicating a bias in the literature. Two studies investigated the effect of the insurance status on non-adherence 34 58, one of which found more non-adherence in blacks who were not privately insured 34. Another study tested and detected self-reported differences between European and US renal transplant patients 64. One study found non-adherence differences in the included centers 67. The lack of evidence about health care system and health care team related factors shows that the patient is implicitly seen as defaulter. As a consequence, opportunities for improving adherence throug h optimizing the health care system or training the health care worker remain hidden 14 65. Future research should therefore focus on issues such as the communication style, knowledge, and skills of the health care worker, on time constraints during clinical consultations, and on organization of the follow-up care. Some general remarks should be made abou t the studies examining determinants of non-adherence with immunosuppressive medicati on in renal transplant patients, more specifically about the used data analysis me thods. Unlike the stud ies investigating the clinical consequences of non-adherence, de terminant studies often do not mention the used statistical test. If they do, few report on the distributional properties of the adopted non-adherence operationalization. This lack of statistical background information for model validatio n jeopardizes the credibility of the presented results, because tests are performed requiring norma lly distributed data; yet, non-adherence measurements are in many cases highly skewed. Another statistical issue concerns the f a c t t h a t m a n y s t u d i e s o n l y r e p o r t s t a t i s tical significant findings, although a large amount of not mentioned candidate determin ants have been tested. Even if studies report all the results, no st udy controlled for multiple te sting. As a consequence, a significant proportion of the reported statis tically significant findings were happening accidentally.

Recommendations for future research This literature review provides the basis for recommendations for future research: 1. Few studies in this literature review use the sensitive method of EM for measuring non-adherence with the immuno suppressive regimen. Future studies assessing prevalence, determinants and co nsequences of non-adherence should use EM as a prime measurement method, preferab ly combined with self-report, assay or collateral report. This triangulation of me thods should provide a good basis for a reliable measurement. In addition, studie s should state the adopted measurement method and accompanying operationa l definition of non-adherence. 2. The statistical analysis methods could be enhanced in many studies. The applied statistical tests should be sp ecified, and should not violate underlying assumptions, as is often the case now. Moreover, too many studies have considerab le multiple testing problems, not only because p-values are not adapted, but also because many studies only report their significant results, and hence, do not mention all variables tested. 3. In view of the exploration of determin ants of non-adherence, research should expand to also assessing heal th care team and health care system related factors, as studies so far have been disp roportionally focusing on primarily patient, socio-economic and treatment related factors. Moreover, the use of qualitative research or statistical techniques modeling the interplay of different variables (e.g. path analytic methods) could further enhance the understanding of the different factors influencing non- adherence. 4. Transplant registries and large outc ome studies should include non-adherence as a relevant parameter to further assess th e impact of non-adherence on outcome on a population basis. To examine the clin ical consequences of non-adherence, prospective cohort studies need to be set up that test the effect of non-adherence under the newer immunosuppressive regimens. Sound economical evaluations exploring the economic consequences of no n-adherence are needed, as the evidence base in this regard is limited to one study. These studies should ta ke into account both costs and outcomes to allow cost-eff ectiveness or cost-utility analyses. 5. This review did not include interventi on studies, due to the fact that this research area still has to be developed. In tervention programs that target modifiable determinants of non-adherenc e, embedded in a chronic disease management program, should be tested in with randomized controlled methodology. 2.7. Conclusion Non-adherence with the immunosuppressive regimen in renal transplantation is a common phenomenon with serious consequences. A deeper understanding of the dynamics underlying non-adherence could be achieved by further exploring its determinants. Emphasis should thereby be put on system factors, as these may offer still unknown possibilities to support patients in reaching a higher adherence level.

A TEST OF ITS ASSUMPTIONS Kris Denhaerynck, Petra Sch\u00e4fer-Keller, Ja mes Young, J\u00fcrg Steiger, Andreas Bock, Christian Surber, Sabina De Geest Submitted to : Nursing Research Examining assumptions of electronic medication monitoring 42 3.1. Introduction The introduction of electronic monitoring (EM) for assessing medi cation non-adherence has enabled researchers and clinicians to gather data about medication-taking behavior with unprecedented precision. EM systems use pill bottles containing a small electronic processor that records the date and time of each cap opening, resulting in a more detailed non-adherence measurement. Comp ared to other method s (e.g., pill counts, assay, self-report, collateral report, prescr iption refills), EM captures more of the dynamics of medication-taking behavior 1. Although EM has for this reason been used as gold-standard method for assessing medication adherence 2 3, empirical evidence and clinical experience suggest that several factors can jeopardize the internal and external validity of EM studies 4. Unbiased EM measurement depends on the fulfillment of at least four assumptions. The first 3 of these assumptions ensure internal validity: (1) correct functioning of the EM equipment, (2) correspondence between EM-bottle openings and actual intake of the prescribed dose, (3) and absence of an EM- associated influence on a patient's normal adherence behavior. The fourth assumption ensures external validity: use of EM does not bias the representativeness of the sample. This article discusse s processes that might lead to a violation of these assumptions and describes how these a ssumptions were empirically tested. 3.1.1. Assumptions underlying valid electronic medication adherence monitoring: internal validity Assumption 1. The first assumption ensuring unbi ased assessment of medication non- adherence requires that electronic monitoring equipment function properly (Figure 1). Quality tests of the widely used Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS\u00ae-6, Aardex Ltd.) performed under different laboratory conditions revealed that, of the 200,000 automatically generated events of 55 bottles and of the 31,740 manually generated events of 30 bottles, no missed, wrongly timed, or extra registrations were found 5 6. Moreover, exposing MEMS-6 to extreme laboratory conditions (e.g., keeping bottles at 60\u00b0C or at 2\u00b0C [n=12] for 6 h or submerging bottles under water for 12 h [n=8]) did not damage registration capacity or erase already registered events (n=12). Likewise, shocks (n=11) and vibrations (n=12) generated no extra events and did not damage subsequent registration capacity. On ly a water resistance problem occurred in some bottles after they we re subjected to unusually high atmospheric pressures exceeding 1.5 bar (n=13). Reports also exist of how MEMS performs in the field. A two-month assessment of eleven purposively sampled MEMS-IV bottles used in a one-year study of HIV patients (in which a number of bottles were suspected of being damaged) showed that EM registered only 97.5% of the generated events 7. Non-functional MEMS-V caps are also noted in an EM study in kidney transplant patients 8. The exact number of non- functional caps, however, could not be infe rred from the research report, since non- functional caps and unused caps were grouped into one category. Assumption 2: The second assumption ensuring unbiased assessment of medication non-adherence requires that each time the patient unscrews the EM-bottle cap, he/she also ingests the prescribed dose immediatel y. Discrepancies in pill removal and actual ingestion time may lead to over- or underestimation of non-adherence (Figure 1). We defined non-adherence as disregarding the do sage (underdosing, overdosing) or timing (taking the medication at the wrong time ) information given in a prescription. Fig. 1. Overview of possible violations of the assumptions underlying internal and external validity of EM: effects on the non-adherence estimate Internal validity External validity Assumption 1. EM equipment functions correctly 2. All EM-bottle openings correspond to actual intake of the prescribed dose 3. EM does not influence typical adherence behavior 4. Use of EM does not bias the sample representativeness Processes violating this assumption?Non-functioning EM system technology Interference with other adherence strategies (e.g., pill organizer) Intervention effect of starting EM Refusal to participate 3.a Drop-out Loss of data Registration failures Too many 1.b Opening of the EM bottle without ingestion or with in gestion occurrin g at a later time 2.b 2.c Ingestion of a dose larger or smaller than dose prescribed 2.d 3.b 3.c registrations 1.a Correct intake of prescribed drugs from a non-EM source (e.g., after having removed the prescribed dose from the EM bottle) 2.a 3.d Effect of the violation Overestimation of non-adherence Underestimation of non-adherence Abbreviations: EM, electronic monitoring Examining assumptions of electronic medication monitoring 44 Overestimating non-adherence occurs when patients correctly ingest the immunosuppressive medication either from a source other than the EM bottle or from a supply of pills previously removed from the EM bottle 7 (see Figure 1, arrow 2.a). In these cases, patients can in fact be fully adherent but because EM-bottle openings are not registered, their adherence cannot be proven. Patients may avoid using the EM bottle because of practical or privacy reasons, making them reluctant to use the EM system outside the home 9 10. Overestimation of adherence also occurs when patients open the EM bottle but do not remove any pills (e.g., in a twice da ily regimen, a third registration occurs when a patient demonstrat es the EM system to friends; Figure 1, arrow 2.b). Phantom openings may, on the contrary, lead to underestimation of non- adherence if a prescribed opening is registered, but no medicine is taken 11 (e.g., in a twice daily regimen, only one intake occurs even though 2 openings are registered; Figure 1, arrow 2.c). EM-bottle openin gs without pill removal can occur quite frequently. In the HIV population, 26% of patients report at least one opening of the EM bottle without taking medication 7. Finally, underestimation of non-adherence may also occur if patients ingest doses that are larger or smaller than those prescribed (Figure 1, arrow 2d). Under- or overestimation of non-adherenc e can, to some extent, be prevented by asking patients to report discrepancies between cap openings and pill intakes and using these reports to correct the raw EM data. Several studies have implemented this method, offering patients a form on whic h to write down occurred discrepancies 9 12. However, patients who are non-adherent to the medication therapy are also likely to keep poor records of discrepancies 13. Moreover, asking patients to keep notes might induce self-monitoring and thus become an adherence-enhancing intervention. Assumption 3. The third assumption underlying va lid EM measurement requires the absence of an EM-induced effect on a pati ent's normal or typical adherence behavior (Figure 1). Two pathways are important in this regard. Firstly, EM may influence normal intake behavior because patients ca nnot use medication aids like pill organizers as usual and, at the same time, be electronically monitored 4. Secondly, the awareness of being monitored may change the patient's typical adherence habits 14. Using a pill organizer can increase the burden of a patient participating in an EM study, and lead to a lower participation to EM -studies among the pill-organizer users 4, or to stopping to use the pill organizer when continuing to be part of the study 15 (Figure 1, arrow 3.a). The problems related to combin ing an EM bottle and a pill organizer are expected to result in overestimating non-adherence (arrow 3.b). Support for the hypothesis that the awareness of being monitored may change a patient's typical medication-taking habits comes from patient reports indicating that being electronically monitored influences normal intake behavior. In most cases, patients reported an increased adherence, seldom a decreased one 4 9 12 16-18 (Figure 1, arrows 3.d & 3.c). Support from sources ot her than these patient reports is scarce (Table 1). Five intervention studie s examined whether administering EM 14 16 19 or disclosing the monitoring purpose of EM 13 20 changed a patient's typical adherence behavior and one observational study examined whether non-adherence increased over time after having started EM 21. The results from these studies were inconclusive. The studies of Elixhauser et al. (1990) an d Bertholet et al. (2000) confirmed that starting EM alters adherence behavior, wh ile the other studies could not find any difference. The latter finding most probably reflected the existence of methodological weaknesses, rather than the absence of an EM-related intervention effect. A study overcoming most of the methodological flaws of currently published studies should include a large enough sample, evaluate a possible intervention effect at different time Table 1: Published studies testing a possible intervention effect of electronic-medication monitoring on typical medication-taking behavior Author & publication year Study design Description of the sample n EM Description of the intervention Outcome variable: medication adherence or clinical outcome Result Wagner et al. 2002 RCT A community convenience sample of adult HIV-positive patients on HAART 117 MEMS Experimental group received EM; control group did not Adherence measured with self- report (4 weeks after start of study) using a taking adherence parameter a Less adherence (insignificant) in the EM group (91%) than in the control group (94%; p=.73) Pre-post inter-vention study A community convenience sample of adult HIV-positive patients on HAART monitored with EM 60 MEMS EM started after baseline blood pressure measurement Adherence measured with self- report at baseline and after 4 weeks Less adherence (insignificant) after introducing EM (91%) compared to baseline (93%; p=.16) Bertholet et al. 2000 Pre-post inter- vention study A convenience sample of primary care/hypertensive clinic patients with therapy- resistant hypertension 69 MEMS EM started after baseline blood pressure measurement Clinical outcome: blood pressure evaluation after 1-2 months Blood pressure was lower after EM (14/9 cm Hg) compared to baseline (16/10 cm Hg; p<.001) Matsui et al. 1994 Pre-post inter- vention study A convenience sample of young -thalassemia out- patients on a new iron chelator 10 MEMS The purpose of EM was disclosed to patients after \u00b1 11 months Adherence measured by EM using the taking adherence parameter \u00b1 18 months after disclosure Greater adherence (insignificant) after disclosure (84%) compared to before (77%; p=.49) Yeung et al. 1994 Quasi- experi-mental study Non-equivalent study: two convenience samples of asthma patients on inhaling therapy 21 MDI Intervention group given disclosure; control group not given disclosure Adherence measured by EM using the taking adherence parameter after 2-3 weeks from the study start Greater adherence (insignificant) in the disclosed group (81%) than in the undisclosed group (71%; p=.53) Elixhauser et al. 1990 RCT A convenience sample of psychiatric outpatients treated with lithium 90 Blister package Experimental group received EM; control group did not Adherence measured by self- reported, assay,% of expected prescription refills (after 2-4 months of study start) Fewer expected prescription refills in the EM group (18%) than in the control group (31%; p<.01) Cramer et al. 1990 Obser- vational study An unspecified sample of patients 24 MEMS All patients received EM Adherence measured by EM using the taking adherence parameter during the first and after a mean of 7 months from the start of the study No significant difference found before and after (79% vs. 79%). a Taking adherence = (number of taken pills / number of prescribed pills)*100 Abbreviations: electronic Dose Inhaler; RCT, Randomized Controlled Trial Examining assumptions of electronic medication monitoring 46 points, use statistical tests properly, and adopt a non-adherence measurement method independent of a patient's awareness (thus not self-report). 3.1.2. Assumption underlying valid electronic medication adherence monitoring: external validity The fourth assumption refers to issues that might threaten the representativeness of the sample of an EM study. Examples includ e a large proportion of eligible subjects refusing to participate and a large proportion of patients dropping out of a study. The term dropout refers to patients who leave the study, who do not send their EM caps back to the research team, or who do not adhere to the guidelines underlying correct EM use (resulting in unreliable EM data). With the exception of a couple of studies that provided some evidence for representativeness bias, limited evidence exists concerning the external validity of EM studies. In on e study, a smaller number of pill-organizer users decided to participate in EM than did non-users; the authors attributed this disparity to the burden of combining EM with pill organizers 4. Another study found that especially patients non-adherent to the medica tion have difficulties also to be adherent to the guidelines of the assessment 13. 3.1.3. Purpose of the study Because no study to date has tested th e four assumptions underlying valid EM measurement, the aim of the present study was to examine whether these assumptions were fulfilled when using EM in a sample of kidney transplant patients. More specifically, we aimed (1) to examine the accurate functioning of EM technology, (2) to check the correspondence of recorded EM-bottle openings with the actual intake of the prescribed dose, (3) to test whether EM influenced the typical adherence behavior of patients, and (4) to examine whether using EM biased the representativeness of the sample. 3.2. Methods 3.2.1. Design, sample, and setting The data for this prospective cohort study came from the Supporting Medication Adherence in Renal Transplantation (SMART) study 22. Patients were eligible if they had received their kidney transplant at least one year prior to enrollmen t, and if they were self-administering immunosuppressive medica tion, more than 18 years of age, German or French speaking, and literate. Patients were excluded if they were not mentally able to respond adequately to the researcher's questions or to complete the questionnaires. The convenience sample consisted of patients followed up at two outpatient transplant clinics in Switzerland. Swiss health insuranc e, which is compulsory, largely covers costs for immunosuppressive medications. Patients are responsible for paying out-of-pocket expenses amounting to about 10% of costs for prescribed drugs. 3.2.2. Variables and measurement We used the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS-5 TrackCap) to measure non- adherence to immunosuppressi ve medications. The monito ring lasted three months and focused on one immunosuppressive drug per patient, preferably one taken twice Examining assumptions of electronic medication monitoring 47 daily (cyclosporine, tactrolim us, mycophenolate mofetil). To capture the two dosing times of patients taking a combination of azathioprine and prednisone, both of which are typically prescribed once daily, we monitored the usage of both drugs. All patients received information about the monitoring of their medication-taking behavior, as requested by the ethical committee. Patients were also asked whether they perceived that using EM influenced their normal medication-intake behavior, and whether this influence changed their typical adherence to the immunosuppressives positively or negatively. All participants received verbal and written instructions on how to use the EM system. Instructions stressed the need to match EM -bottle openings with actual drug intakes and requested patients to write down deviat ions from this guideline on a form that accompanied the EM bottle. Examples of such guideline violations include accidentally opening the EM bottle, stopping EM bottle use for a period of time, and removing pills prematurely. Upon completion of the EM measurements, we integrated these patient notes into the uploaded EM data. At the end of the 3-month EM period, we used a structured interview to assess adherence to the EM instructions. The first go al of this interview was to detect defined periods of non-adherence to the EM instructions and to exclude them from the analysis (e.g., when a patient failed to use the EM device during the holidays for 14 days). The second goal of the interview was to assess the quality of the remaining data by scoring them according to five quality standards: (1 ) strict adherence to the EM guidelines (5 points); (2) self-report indicated that the EM system was not used exactly as instructed, but complete notes were available (4 points); (3) self-report indicated that the EM system was not used exactly as inst ructed, but incomplete notes were available (3 points); (4) self-report indicated that the EM system was not used exactly as instructed, but no notes were available (2 points); and (5) self-report indicated that neither the EM bottle nor the form was used as instructed (1 point) (Figure 2). Data was considered to be of sufficient quality fo r analysis when the patient received a score of 3 points or higher. Dropped EM caps. We asked the patients to report if they dropped their EM caps to determine whether dropping the caps damaged the caps' recording capacity. When the patients indicated on their special form that a drop occurred, we checked whether the recording system still functioned properly by scanning the uploaded EM data visually for extra recordings or for altered registration patterns. Operational definition of EM-measured adherence. Electronically measured non- adherence was evaluated for each prescribed intake moment. Two binary variables represented the taking and timing dimensions of the patients' non-adherence. The first variable indicated whether a patient omitte d a dose (taking dimension). The second variable indicated whether the monitored inter-dose interval deviated by more than 25% from the prescribed interval or whet her the medication was taken within the 25% range (timing dimension). Other variables included in this study. To compare the characteristics of patients included in the EM study with those that refused to participate or dropped out, we measured non-adherence to the immunosuppressive therapy using self-report, collateral report, and blood assay. In the self-report , patients used a 7-point scale to score the frequency of non-adherence during the four weeks just prior to the inclusion interview - the scale ranged from never (0 points) to every day (7 points). This ordinal non-adherence variable was assessed du ring the inclusion interview. In the collateral Examining assumptions of electronic medication monitoring 48 report, nurses and physicians involved in the foll ow-up care of the transplant patients scored non-adherence using a 3-point scale - good adherence (1 point), fair adherence (2 points), bad adherence (3 points). We used the mean scores of the health-care workers who evaluated and scored patients. With regard to the blood assay, non- adherence was scored according to each patien t's drug trough levels at inclusion (i.e., of cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, or sirolimus). 3.2.3. Data collection The study was reviewed and approved by the appropriate ethical committees, and patients signed informed co nsents. We collected data from June 2001 to January 2004. Four research staff members recruited the patients, collected demographic and self-reported non-adherence data, and instruct ed the patients on how to use the EM system. After three months of electronic monitoring, participants received a letter to remind them to either bring back the EM device to the outpatient clinic or to send it back to the researchers (in a pre-stamped and pre-addressed envelope). Upon return of the device, we telephoned the patients and carried out a structured interview to assess their adherence to the EM guidelines (see Figure 2). During the interview, we also sought to determine ho w EM may have influenced the patients' typical adherence behavior. We used Powerview \u00ae hard- and software to upload and adjust the EM data according to the patients' notes. 3.2.4. Data analysis Assumptions 1, 2 & 4 needed descriptive statistics. We calculated the prevalence of malfunctioning EM systems (assumption 1), th e prevalence of reported cap recording mismatches and non-adherence to the EM sy stem (assumption 2), and the proportion of pill organizer users not participating (a ssumption 4). We also compared tabulated mean values of non-EM measured adherence between participants and non-participants/dropouts (assumption 4). Assumption 3 required inferential statis tics. We modeled the probability of non- adherence as a function of a patient's exposure time to the EM system by performing two multiple random-intercepts logistic regression analysis, one modeling dose omissions and one timing non-adherence. The random-intercepts models, which we fitted using the nlmixed procedure in SAS \u00ae version 9.1, accounted for the repeated measurement structure of the data. These mult iple models controlled for the variables \"bottle volume\" (1055cc, 120cc), \"t interview\", and \"the self-reported perceived EM-intervention effect \" (positive or not). For validity information on this method, see ap pendix 1. To get a more detailed insight into non-adherence over time , we also fit a generalized additive model including a spline smoothed function of exposure time 23. This function left the relationship between non-adherence and explosure ti me unspecified, and allowed graphical exploration of nonlinearities.

Results Four hundred thirteen adult renal transplant recipients visiting the outpatient clinic for their yearly check-up were asked to participate in the SMART study (Figure 3). Three hundred fifty-six accepted (86%) and 57 (14%) refused to participate in our study. Of the 57 patients, 28 granted us permission to obtain their demographic and clinical data from their medical files. Of the 356 part icipating patients, 291 (82%) agreed to be monitored electronically. The remaining 65 (18%) patients did not want to be monitored electronically but wanted to participate by completing the self-report questionnaires. Of the 291 patients who agreed to be monitored with EM, 3 (1%) never started, 3 (1%) did not return their EM caps, and one died (<1%). Thirty-four (12%) patients were excluded from the analyses because they failed to adhere to the EM guidelines. The final sample consisted of 250 patients, with an average age of 52.9 years (sd=13.5; Table 2). The majority of su bjects were Swiss citizens (n=208; 83.5%) and male (n=141; 41.1%). Fig. 3.

Sixty-one (22%) patients reported that they had dropped their EM caps. None of these caps registered the drop as an event, nor did the data afterwards reflect any visually detectable signs of damage to the recording system. One patient who never dropped his cap claimed to have better adherence than suggested by his EM data. A manual check of his cap revealed that it failed to register openings. This cap Examining assumptions of electronic medication monitoring 51 seemed to have gradually lost its registrati on capacity during the 3-month monitoring period, because all expected openings within the first two weeks of the measurement period were recorded, after which the event recordings declined. Although the gradual decline of cap function suggested a battery problem, a battery check did not reveal an exhausted battery. Assumption 2. Of the 249 patients with reliabl e EM data, 155 (62%) reported discrepancies on their form between recorded openings and actual medication intakes, which required 1084 corrections to the 44761 records of raw EM data (2.4 corrections, on average, per person). Twenty-eight percent of the corrections involved early decants of pills that were ingested late r. The most frequent ly mentioned reasons patients gave for the discrepancies were going out, being on a trip, and having a meeting. Other reasons for correspondence failures were taking medication from another supply, phantom openings to demonstrate the EM bottle to visitors, and opening the wrong bottle. Twenty-three patients (9.2%) had defined periods of non-adherence to the EM guidelines. For these patients, an average of 13.6 days were excluded from the total monitoring period. Our sensitivity analysis showed that the average percentage of correctly dosed days reached 92.9% when including the defined periods, but amounted to 96.3% when excluding the defined periods.

After day 35, th e taking dimension of non-adherence stabilized. The average perc entage of correctly dose d days was 96.7% when including the entire 3-month measurement period, but slightly decreased to 96.3% when the first 35 days were excluded. The timing dimension of non-adherence stabilized after about day 50. The average percentage of correctly timed intakes was 91.8% when including all data points , and slightly decreased to 91.4% when only considering the stable phase between day 50 and 75. A post hoc analysis identifying potential interactions between exposure to the EM bottle and perception of the EM-intervention effect , showed a stronger EM-intervention effect in patients acknowledging an intervention effect than in patients stating that they experienced no intervention effect (p=0.003). Fig. 4. This figure presents the nonlinear regression lines modeling the rise of non- adherence over time after the start of electronic monitoring. Because nonlinear trends are easier to detect when axes have a linear interpre tation, the Y-axis' probability on non-adherence is transformed to a linear log-odds scale. The figure indicates that non-adherence increased until the first 35 days of electronic monitoring (vertical line). After 35 days, non-adherence was unrelated to exposure. Assumption 4. A comparison of pill or ganizer use in participants vs. non- participants in the EM part of our stu dy showed that pillbox use was more common among non-participants (38.5%) than among participants (25.1%). Table 4 compares non-EM adherence measurements of participants and non- participants/dropouts. The table shows that, although expected, dropouts did not Examining assumptions of electronic medication monitoring 54 have a lower adherence to the immunosuppressive therapy than did participants. The same can be said of the non-participants: the data counterintuitively suggested slightly higher immunosuppressive blood assay values among the non- participants. This pattern remained the same when analyzing those who did not use a pill organizer (data not shown).

Discussion This study examined four assumptions und erlying the valid electronic measurement of medication non-adherence, which, if violated, might threaten the external and/or internal validity of EM studies. Assumption 1. We identified one EM device that had stopped recording cap openings during the study. Although previous laboratory test reports from Aardex, the company that markets MEMS, did not mention failures, our finding confirms literature reports that EM devices used in studies can be damaged 8 23. Admittedly, the Aardex report dealt with the newer MEMS-6 monitors, not the MEMS-5 monitors used in our study. MEMS-6 mainly differs from MEMS-5 in its data upload technology, otherwise MEMS-6 is comparable to its predecessor in most of its other components (www.aardex.ch; accessed September 6, 20 05). The existence of a non-registering cap shows that overestimating non-adherence is possible for patients who have damaged caps that remain undetected. A systematic check of the recording system before and after a monitoring period is therefore advisable Examining assumptions of electronic medication monitoring 55 (M-P Schneider, PhD, University of Lausanne, personal communication, Basel, April 18, 2005). Assumption 2. The present study revealed that EM registrations often do not correspond to the actual ingestion of th e monitored medication. A recent study of HIV patients came to the same conclusion, finding that 36% of patients failed to use their EM bottles continuously during a one-year monitoring period, 38% of patients used their EM bottles only on occasion, and 3% of patients always removed more than one dose per EM-bottle opening 7. These percentages confirm that mismatches between EM-bottle regi strations and ingest ion are common and that non-monitored periods often occur. We showed that negating non-monitored periods can result in a bias in the prevalence of monitored periods, as illustrated by our sensitivity analysis. We overesti mated non-adherence by 3.4% when we included the non-monitored periods into ou r analyses of data obtained during the 3-month monitoring period. The overestimation would have probably been even larger if the Powerview analysis software we used for uploading and correcting the EM data allowed us only to export the uncorrected registrations instead of those we corrected using the patients' notes. Al so, the discrepancy will probably be larger in populations with higher non-adherence levels. Better correspondence between event re gistration and pill ingestion may be achieved by improving the way MEMS-6 measures adherence. An often mentioned drawback of MEMS is its impracticality 7; thus, a more practical, easy-to-use system may increase EM use outside of the home. Recent efforts are being made in this regard in that several companies have started to market EM-blister 3. Testing the third assumption revealed that EM influenced adherence behavior. We detected an in itial increase of non-adhere nce, and believe that this increase reflects the waning of the adherence-enhancing effect of introducing EM in patients' daily life. To assess patients' normal level of adhere nce, studies should examine presence and duration of an intervention effect using longitudinal analysis techniques 24. Traditional analysis approaches, using period prevalence parameters like \"the percentage of prescribed medications that are taken\", are limited with regard to analysis of detailed time-depen dent evolutions. Moreover, their often J- shaped distributions force researchers to rely on simple nonparametric tests 25. Given that the found intervention effect lasted more than one month, the validity of EM studies of one month or less can be questioned. Longer monitoring periods are probably less prone to bias, as shown by the fact that we only found minimal differences in period prevalences including the intervention period compared to prevalences excluding it. Assumption 4. We found little evidence of compromised external validity in this sample of renal transplant patients. Our study indeed confirmed previous research that found less willingness to partic ipate among pill-organizer users 4, but failed to confirm the hypothesis that patients who did not adhere to EM guidelines display higher medication non-adherence than patients who did adhere to the guidelines 13. This does not necessarily mean that there was no difference: measurement error coming from small sample sizes, low sensitivity of no n-EM non-adherence assessment 1, and probably also of the EM-data quality assessment, may have blurred existing differences. Few conclusions can be made from the blood assay Examining assumptions of electronic medication monitoring 56 data showing that values tended to be higher in non-participants compared to participants. The differences were very sm all compared to their variability and not confirmed by self-report or collateral report data. 3.5. Conclusion This study shows that electronic monitoring of medication adherence, today's most sensitive method of measuring medication intake, can be further improved by fulfilling methodological requirements, such as the four assumptions discussed in this article: (1) A systematic functionality control of the EM syst em before and after use is indicated; (2) assessment of adhe rence to the EM guidelines should be incorporated in each EM study, and a form should be used on which patients can register deviations from the guidelines; (3) each EM study should examine intervention effects and estimate potential biases; and (4) further research examining the sample representativeness in EM studies is needed. Meeting these methodological standards may put EM on an even higher plane, helping it to really achieve its gold-standard aspirations. Reference list 1.

PREVALENCE AND RISK FACTORS OF NON -ADHERENCE WITH IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE MEDICATION IN KIDNEY TRANSPLANT PATIENTS Sabina De Geest In re-review : American Journal of Transplantation Prevalence and risk factors of non-adherence 60 4.1. Introduction Receiving a kidney allograft entails a life-lo ng intake of immunosuppressive medication to prevent rejection of the transplanted kidney. Although strict adherence to the immunosuppressive drug therapy is crucial to keeping the kidney well functioning, recipients do not always perfectl y adhere to the agreed regimen 1. Studies that electronically monitor medication intake behavior of recipients, using microchip fitted pill bottles 2, show that adult kidney transplant patients are non-adherent to their immunosuppressive therapy in 3% to 7% of the monitored days 3-5. Non-adherence in kidney transplant is associated with an incr eased number of late acute rejections, late kidney graft failure 3 6-8, increased health care costs 9, and has been suggested 10 as a possible contributing factor of the recently observed stagnation of long-term survival of kidney grafts 11 12. Improving long-term outcomes in kidney transplantation may be achieved by enhancing adherence to the immunosuppressive therapy of patients at risk. Unfortunately, limited evidence is availabl e about risk factors of non-adherence to immunosuppressives in kidney transplant patients. Of all possible risk factors, categorized by the WHO into the classes 'socio-economic', 'patient-related', 'condition/disease-related', 'therapy/treatment-related', or 'health care system/health care worker-related' factors 13, only socio-economic variables have been extensively studied in adult kidney transplant patients 1. Frequently studied socio-economic risk factors for non-adherence with the immunosuppressive regimen are 'younger age' 14-22 and 'being less imbedded in a social netw ork' (i.e. being unmarried, living alone, having no employment) 14 18 21 23 24. However, in contrast to many risk factors in other categories, socio-economic factors are often of limited use to clinicians because of their relatively unmodifiable nature . Moreover, many show inconsistent relationships to non- adherence (e.g. education) 1. Self-efficacy 23 and erroneous health beliefs 18 25 are two examples of clinically valuable patient-related risk factors . Self-efficacy refers to a pers on's confidence in mastering a specific task 26, and plays a central role in initiati on and persistence of human behavior 26 27. Health beliefs refer to a recipient's belief system regarding disease and therapy, a synthesis of information coming from prev ious experience, cultural background, and communication with significant othe rs and health care authorities 28. Other patient- related factors that are related to medication taking behavior in kidney transplant patients are health behaviors such as smoking or alcohol use 15 29. The factor busyness/routine in life-style, which has been studied in HIV and arthritis population 30 31, could also be a risk factor in kidney transplantation. Also of clinical interest are factors related to a patient's condition or therapy . Tested and found to be associated to non-adhere nce in kidney transplantation are higher symptom experience 5 18 20 24, more previous rejections 20, longer time since transplantation 19 20, having received a graft from a living (related) donor 14 18 32, and depression 15 21. Suggested relevant factors but not yet appropriately tested in kidney transplantation are the use of medication aids 33, treatment complexity and changes 13, and pre-emptive transplantation 14. A last category, health care system/w orker-related factors, has been stud ied to a lesser extent. Only a small number of system-relat ed risk factors are studied. Having no health insurance is for instance related to non-adherence 34. Other studies found that non-adherence varies among centers 5 35. Prevalence and risk factors of non-adherence 61 Although some risk factors for non-adhere nce in kidney transplantation have been identified, important methodological shortcomings of the cited studies prevent firm conclusions 1. The majority of studies have a important methodological shortcomings, such as multiple testing problems, or the us e of self-report to measure non-adherence, which is known to have less sensitivity co mpared to other methods (e.g. electronic monitoring of medication intake) 36. Moreover, many possibly im portant risk factors of non-adherence already tested in other popu lations (HIV, heart transplantation) have not been extensively examined in kidney transplantation. The aim of this study was therefore do a comprehensive assessment and testing of risk factors of non-adherence. To maximize the power of this study and enhance the validity of its results, we measured no n-adherence by sophisticated electronic monitoring technology. 4.2. Methodology 4.2.1. Design, sample and setting This prospective study is part of the Su pporting Medication Adherence in Renal Transplantation (SMART) project 37 38. The study's convenience sample included adult kidney transplant recipients older than 18 years, who were at least one year transplanted, who managed their immunosuppressives intake independently, were German or French speaking, literate, and who were followed up at one of the two included outpatient transplant clinics in S witzerland. Exclusion cr iteria were lack of mental acuity to answer the questions or inability to read. Swiss health insurance, which is compulsory, largely covers costs fo r immunosuppressive medications. Patients are responsible for paying out-of-pocket expenses amounting to about 10% of costs for prescribed drugs. 4.2.2. Variables and measurement 4.2.2.1. Non-adherence measurement Electronic monitoring of non-adherence. We assessed non-adherence with immunosuppressive medication by elec tronic monitoring, using the MEMS\u00ae-V TrackCap system (Aardex, Ltd.). Provided that cert ain validity issues are taken into account 37, EM has proven to be the most sensitive and valid measurement method for assessing non-adherence, able to detect minor deviations from the prescribed treatment regimen in clinically stable patients 36. Moreover, EM provides information on patients' daily medication intake dynamics. Validity of the EM measurement. To ensure the validity of the EM measurement, we excluded the first 35 days of the EM measur ement period from the analyses because of a detected intervention effect of starting up EM 37. We also asked patients to write down actual medication intake times on a special form when cap openings did not correspond to medication intake. The form notes allowed us to correct mismatches between registrations and actual dose inta kes. We also assessed adherence to the guidelines of correct EM and form use in a telephone interview at the end of the monitoring period. The telephone call allowed us to exclude data of time periods in which a patient was not adherent to the EM guidelines. Patients who made no Prevalence and risk factors of non-adherence 62 continuous use of the EM-bottle and did not notify this on the form, were excluded from the study. Definition of the EM variables. Variables for describing period prevalences and for doing inferential analyses we re calculated differently. The EM period prevalence parameters were 39: (1) taking adherence , the percentage of prescribed doses that were taken; (2) dosing adherence , the percentage of days with correct dosing; (3) timing adherence , the percentage of inter-dose intervals within 25% of the prescribed interval; and (4) drug holidays , the number of periods without drug intake that exceeded 48h in a once daily, or 24h in a twice daily regimen, standardized over 100 monitored days. The assessment period started 35 days after monitoring the first morning dose and ended three months later; or earlier when the patient dropped out. We defined a day as starting at 3:00 am and ending at 2.59 am. The outcome variable in the inferential anal yses consisted of a longitudinal binary sequence representing patients' non-adherence status on each prescribed intake moment. Omitted doses or wrongly timed dose s were considered as non-adherence. A dose was considered as rightly timed if the interval with the previous dose did not deviate more than 25% from the prescribed interval. Excess dosing was not taken into account, as previous research showed that only a minority of EM-detected overconsumption really corresponds to overdosing 40. 4.2.2.2. Measurement of risk factors of non-adherence We explored selected risk factors of non- adherence from all five dimensions of the WHO classification of non- adherence risk factors. Socio-economic factors retrieved from the medical files were age, gender, and nationality; those assessed by structured interview were living alone/together, being employed/unemployed, the perception of adequacy of the financial situation to cover costs of medications (on a 4-point scale from more than enough to not enough money), and educational level (measured by a 4-points ordinal variable reflecting the age until which patients went to school: until 11/12, 14/15, 18/19 years, or longer). Rece ived social support with medication taking was assessed using an 8-item scale that sc ored how often it happened in the past month that a patient received social support from others (e.g. someone helped preparing the medication) 41. Unrotated principal component analysis revealed unidimensionality among 7 items that loaded at least 0.44 on the first factor. One item (\"Was there someone who went to the pharmacy for you to get your medication?\") only loaded 0.27 on the first component, indicating that it measured a different aspect o f s o c i a l s u p p o r t . W e t h e r e f o r e c o n s i d e r e d t h i s i t e m a s a s e p a r a t e v a r i a b l e i n t h e analyses and calculated an average total score on the remaining seven items. The 7- item scale had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.70. Patient-related factors explored by structured intervie w in this study were vaccination status (influenza and pneumonia), current smoking status (yes/no), frequency of alcohol use during the last month (on a 6-point scale ranging from daily to never), use of complementary medicine (e.g. homeopat hy, St. John's worth, Chinese medicines), and the day of the week. We also measured self-reported non-adherence by asking patients in a non-threatening, non-accusatory way how frequently they did not take their immunosuppressive medication in the past four weeks 18. They could answer on a 7-point scale ranging from never to every day. Prevalence and risk factors of non-adherence 63 Multi-item validated self-report instruments were used to measure self-efficacy with medication taking 42, illness representations 18, business and routine in life style 31 43, and coping style 44. Self-efficacy was measured using the Long-Term Medicati on Behavior Self-Efficacy scale 42, a 27-item instrument with a 5-point sc ale ranging from 1 (=little confidence) to 5 (=strong confidence). The scale has been validated in both transplant and other populations as being a unidimensional instrument showing predictive validity 45. The instrument's unidimensionality was reconfirmed in this stu dy; an unrotated principal component analysis showed that the first component, on which all items loaded at least 0.44, accounted for 41% of the variance. We used the average score as a measure of self-efficacy. Illness representations related to medicati on taking was assessed by a scale developed by Greenstein and Siegal 18, consisting of 10 beliefs about immunosuppressive drugs (e.g. \"I will only be able to keep my kidney if I take my post tr ansplant drugs\"). For each health belief statement, patients scored their level of agreement on a 5-point scale ranging from 'completely disagree' to 'completely agree'. An unrotated principal component analysis revealed that the items hardly shared common information: absolute component loadings on the first component ranged from |0.20| to |0.65|, with an average of |0.41|. Because of the lack of unidimensionality, we considered each item as a separate variable in the analyses. Coping was assessed by the Utrecht Coping List (UCL) 44, a 47-item instrument measuring a person's coping style when fa ced with difficult life situations. Patients scored on a scale from 1 (=seldom or never) to 4 (=very often) the frequency of a specific coping behavior. The scale is meant to measure seven different styles: 1) active coping (taking action to solve a problem), 2) avoidance coping (avoiding difficult situations or resigning), 3) seeking social support , 4) passive coping (waiting for things to change), 5) expression of emotions (showing emotions but no t directly approaching a problem), 6) reassuring coping (overcoming a problem by thinking about bigger problems), and 7) palliative coping (taking action to soothe the discomfort of a problem) 44. An examination of the internal stru cture of the instrument using varimax rotated principal component analysis, reveal ed that the last co mponent (palliative coping) consisted entirely of items that cross-loaded on other components. We therefore omitted this component from th e analysis and refined the six remaining subscales by deleting items that loaded on more than one component at the same time. The six subscales had acceptable internal consistency, as shown by the respective Cronbach's alpha values (0.80, 0.62, 0.84, 0.76, 0.50, and 0.70), which made it possible to calculate me an scores for each subscale. Life style was assessed by the ACQ Busyne ss Scale, a 13-item 5-point self-report instrument presenting statements related to the dimensions busyness and regularity in one's daily life 31 43. A varimax rotated principal component analysis confirmed the existence of two dimensions: 'busyness' (the items 1 to 9) and 'routine' (the items 10- 13), for which the Cronbach's alpha values were 0.85 and 0.76, respectively. The variables busyness and routine were calculat ed by averaging the items in each of the dimensions. As condition-related factors , we extracted two variables from the medical file, namely body mass index and Charlson comorbidity index (omitting the age aspect, to prevent collinearity with the already in cluded variable age). We also measured depressive symptomatology by self-report using the Beck Depression Inventory 46 47, a 21-item 4-Prevalence and risk factors of non-adherence 64 points self-report scale asse ssing the emotional, cognitive and physical symptoms of depression. An unrotated principal componen t analysis confirmed the unidimensionality of the scale by showing one distinct componen t on which all items loaded at least 0.40. The scale's Cronbach's was 0.88, which allowed us to calculate a mean score over all items. The therapy-related factors extracted from the medical file were graft type (cadaver, living-related [e.g. a sibling], or living-unrel spouse]), dialysis mode (peritoneal or haemo-dialysis), to tal time spent on dialysis, pre-emptive transplantation (yes/no), the number of received transplants, the number of prescribed medications, prescription changes, the regimen (once or twice daily), and medication intake time (morning or evening). We also measured by structur ed interview whether patients used medication aids (pillbox, alarm clock, beeper, calendar, putting the medication conspicuously on one or different places). Symptom experience was measured with the Modified Transplant Symptom Occurrence and Symptom Distress Scale 48 49, a self-report instrument consisting of 45 symptoms measuring both symptom occurrence and symptom distress. Patients scored the occurrence of symptoms on a 5-point scale (0 to 4), and the accompanying distress on a separate and visually distinct 5-point scale (1 to 5). Distress scores were deleted if symptom occurrence was indicated as not present (=0). Because an unrotated principal component analysis on the occurrence items showed that the average absolute component loading only reached |0.38|, and that the shared variance among the items was only 16%, we considered ea ch item as a separate variable in the analyses, an approach that differed from previous studies 5 18 20 24. Health care system/health care worker-related factors assessed in this study were the number of clinic visits the patient had during the 3 months study period, the number of days before the next follow-up visit (both retrieved from the medical files)50, and outpatient center (Basle or Aarau). 4.2.3. Data collection The study was reviewed and approved by the appropriate ethical review boards. We collected data from June 2001 to January 2004. Four research staff members recruited the patients, collected demographic and self -reported non-adherence data, instructed the patients on how to use the EM system, and obtained signed informed consents. Patients took the self-report questionnaires home, were asked to complete them and send them back in a pre-stamped and pre-addressed envelope. After three months of electronic monitoring, participants received a letter to remind them to either bring back the EM device to the outpatient clinic or to send it back to the researchers. Upon return of the device, we telephoned the patients and carried out a structured interview to assess their adherence to the EM guidelines. During the interview, we also sought to determine how EM may have influenced the patients' typical adherence behavior. We used Powerview \u00ae hard- and software to upload and adjust the EM data according to the patients' notes. 4.2.4. Statistical analysis We checked the distribution of the non-adherence period prevalence parameters, and calculated the following centra l tendency and variance parameters: average, median, inter-quartile range, and range. Each risk factor's relationship with non-adherence was Prevalence and risk factors of non-adherence 65 separately tested using simple random-intercept logistic re gression analysis. To prevent the accumulation of type I errors among the logistic regression analyses, we adapted all p-values by a method that holds the expected proportion of type I errors among the rejected null hypotheses at 5% 51. The tables presenting the results contain all uncorrected (p) significant variables, with th eir multiple testing co rrected estimates and inferences (q). Variables that were signific ant after correction for multiple testing were put into a multiple random intercept logistic regression model. Because, as in a lot of behavioral research, many risk factors might be correlated with each other, we checked for possible multi-collinearity by calcul ating the variance inflation factor of the variables in the multiple regression mode l. All analyses were done in SAS 9.1. 4.3. Results 4.3.1. Sample characteristics Four hundred thirteen adult renal transplant recipients visiting the outpatient clinic for their yearly check-up were asked to partic ipate in this study, of which 86% (N=356) agreed to take part with the questionnaire part and 291 to be monitored electronically (Figure 1). Of these 291 EM patients, 3 (=1%) never started EM, 3 did not return the EM cap, 1 (<1%) died in the beginning of the study, and 34 (=11.7%) were excluded from the analyses because of non-adherence to the EM guidelines. The final sample (N=249) had a mean age of 53.5 years (sd=12 .7), consisted of 83.6% Swiss citizens (n=208), and 58.6% males (n=207; Table refusals 356 (86.2%) included 65 (18.3%) question- naires only 291 (81.7%) with EM 284 with data 7 without data - 3 never started - 3 did not return cap - 1 died 35 (12.3%) non- adherent to EM guidelines 249 (87.7%) adherent to EM guidelines (included in the analyses) Prevalence and risk factors of non-adherence 66 Table 1: Demographical characte ristics of the sample (n=249) Variable Categories Value Mean (SD) Age 53.6 (12.7) Frequency (%) Gender Male 141 (56.6%) Living alone No 193 (77.5%) Employed Yes 129 (51.8%) Education until age 11/12 years until age 12/13-14/15 years until age 15/16-18/19 years advanced (college) 33 (13.3%) 117 (47.0%) 26 (10.4%) 73 (29.3%) ( 0.8%) Number of intake times per day Once daily regimen Twice daily regimen Other regimensRegimen changes during the study 8 ( Prevalence of (non-)adherence The EM based period prevalence parameters showed a mean taking adherence of 98% (range: 47-110%; Table 2), a mean dosing adherence of 96% (range: 23-100%), and a mean timing adherence of 92% (range : 18-100%). The mean number of drug holidays standardized per monitored 100 days was 1.1 (range: 0.0-29.1). Inter-quartile ranges show that a substantial number of pa tients had low non-adherence. In the case of timing adherence for instance, it can be calculated from the median and inter-quartile range that 25% of the patients took less than 92.1% of their pills at the right time. 4.3.3. Risk factors of (non-)adherence Table 3 presents the statistically significant results of the simple modeling. Significant risk factors after correction for multiple testing were: yo unger age style (OR=2.3; q=0.03), symptom distress with spots in the face or on the back (OR=1.69; q=0.04), and having a graft from a living-related person (OR=2.88; q=0.02). Also, non-adherence was the lowest on Monday, the highest on Sunday and increased during the days in between (OR=1.04; q=0.02) in a gradual way, as was shown in an additional exploratory analysis. Borderline significant and clinically important (OR=0.37) is that using a pillbox was related to adherence.

The occurrence variable had far fewer missing va lues, yet behaved similarly to the distress variable in the simple regressi on model. Moreover, both variables highly correlated with each other (r=0.49). Table 4 presents the result of the multiple regression model. Significant associations existed betwee n EM-measured non-adherence and CI=1.69-5.61). Table 4: Results of the multiple mi xed logistic regression analysis Random effect Estimate df t p Variance 1.898 234 15.06 <.0001 Fixed effects OR (95% t p Intercept 3.08 (1.69-5.61) (0.61-3.53) 234 0.85 0.39 Having spots on the face / back 1.20 (0.84-1.69) 234 1.01 0.31 A weak collinearity existed between some of the included variables. The non- significance of self-efficacy is probably th e consequence of a weak correlation with self- reported non-adherence (r=0.22). Removing self-reported non-adherence from the model in lower p-va lue for self-eff icacy (p=0.01). Other correlating predictor variables were busyness and age (r=-0.35). Alternately removing them from the model did not change the model's final conclusion. A third predictor variable showing correlation with other predictors in the mo del was graft type. Persons who received a graft from a living-related person were younger (z=-7.2; p<0.0001), busier p=0.03) than those who received a cadaveric graft. Because none of these factors seemed to entirely explain the asso ciation of living-relate d transplantation on non-adherence, we looked in the literatur e for additional information on expected differences between living (related) and cadaveric transplantation 14 18 32, and identified two additional explanatory variables. Recipients of a live donor graft might have a higher chance on pre-emptive transplantation 14, and have a stronger belief in the histocompatibility of th e living-related graft 18. Our sample indeed showed strong differences in pre-emptive transplantatio n frequencies between living-related and cadaveric grafts: only 1% of the cadaveric graft transplantations were pre-emptive, compared to 20% of the living related ( \u00b2=53.8; p<0.0001). Also living-related graft recipients had a stronger belief that \"kidneys from living donors do not need as much immunosuppression as cadaver kidneys\" (z=3 .38; p=0.0007). Including both variables into the multiple model, however, did not change the results of table 4. Prevalence and risk factors of non-adherence 70 4.4. Discussion This study investigated period prevalence and risk factors of non-adherence to the immunosuppressive therapy in adult kidney transplant patients more than one year after transplantation, containing the larges t sample ever of electronically monitored solid transplant recipients. Non-adherence in this sample was slightly lower compared to previous EM studies performed in the U.S. (see above) 3-5. Several explanations for this difference may be posited, for instance, adherent patients may have been more inclined to participate in the EM part of th e study. Such a selection bias, however, was very unlikely, as we checked but did no t find differences in non-adherence as measured by self-reported, health care provider report and blood assay between subjects participating and th ose not participating with EM 52. A second possible explanation for the observed prevalence differences between our study and published ones could be the protocols used to clea n the data. We excluded subjects showing major non-adherence to the EM guidelines, which could have led to higher adherence estimates, as it is known that not excluding patients non-adherent to the EM guidelines leads to overestimating non-adherence 52. Again, this explanation is not likely to fully explain the observed differences. The reason is that two of our own studies in Belgian heart 53 and Dutch liver transplant patients 54 used a similar data cleaning protocol, but nevertheless found lower taking 53 and dosing 54 adherence prevalences than this study (a median 99% on both parameters). A third possible source of non-adherence prevalence variation can be found in regional differences among the compared studied samples. This geographical hypothesis is supported by a recent meta-analysis on individual patient data 55 that pooled self-reported non-adherence data of North American 18 and European patients 37 49, and by non-adherence research in non- transplant populations 56 57. All these studies reveal a similar geographical pattern as can be observed in the just mentioned EM measurements in transplant patients: the highest non-adherence is found in the U.S., the lowest in European samples. Future research will have to confirm this prelim inary evidence of regional variation and determine underlying dynamics. Causes are likely to be of health care system-related origin. Unfortunately, this study was not designed to study correlations between macro-level differences in health care systems (such as access and reimbursement policies) and individual medication adherence behavior. The only evidence our study offers about system-related factors is that differences were found between the two included centers. Although not significant after correction for multiple testing, our finding is supported by other research 5 35, and may indicate that characteristics of health care programs (like chronic disease/ behavioral management practices) influence patients' adherence. Aside from the health care system-related domain, this study identified a relatively small number of risk factors for non-adherenc e out of a large supply of candidate risk factors. The probability that these are not just statistical artifacts, but real risk factors of non-adherence, is very high. Moreover, so me findings are very valuable for clinical practice, in that they offer both possibilitie s for identifying patients at risk for non- adherence, as well as for enhancing adherence. An example of a clinically useful result is the detected link between self-efficacy and adherence, confirming earlier research in transplant 23 53, and other populations (e.g. HIV) 58 59. Efficacy cognitions can be influenced by clinical intervention (e.g. by inducing mastery experience) 60, and are therefore useful as a cornerstone concept in adherence enhancing programs. Other results with possible relevanc e for adherence remediation are the detected strong Prevalence and risk factors of non-adherence 71 associations between adherence and the use of medication aids, confirming research on medication aids done in HIV or glaucoma patients 61-65. Evidence for causal effects of medication aids on non-adherence exist for electronic 63-65 as well as non-electronic reminder devices (e.g. pillboxes) 66. Not useful for adherence remediation, but cert ainly helpful for detecting patients at risk for non-adherence, is the finding that a one-unit increase in self-reported non- adherence resulted in a threefold higher o dds on non-adherence as measured by EM. Self-reported non-adherence was the most powe rful predictor in our multiple model, in spite of the fact that it is not regarded as a very sensitive method for measuring non- adherence 36 67. Supported by earlier research 53, this finding demonstrates the usefulness of self-report for the detection of pa tients at risk for non-adherence. If done in a non-accusatory and non-threatening wa y, self-report can be an easy screening method for detecting patients with non-adherence problems, and can be integrated as a clinical parameter in the clinical follow-up of transplanted patients. The two last significant variables in the mu ltiple model, weekday and gender, are not manipulatable. The gradual increase of non-adherence during the work week, culminating in the weekend, equals re sults of earlier research reporting a discontinuously higher non-adherence on weekend days 68. The variable gender on the other hand was not really expected to appear as a risk factor in this study. Of twelve kidney transplant studies that previo usly looked for gender differences 6 15-18 20-23 32 69 70, only one found that women were more non-adherent than men 21, the opposite result as ours. All remaining variables of the multiple mode l seemed to be explained by other included variables. Non-adherence of living-related graft recipients for instance, is higher because these patients score higher on ri sk factors such as age, busyness, self- efficacy, health beliefs, and the lack of experience with dialysis 14 18. This list is probably not comprehensive, as estimates and inferences of th e model including all these variables hardly differed from the one in Table 4. Therefore, further exploration of characteristics that increase non-adhere nce in living-related graft recipients is indicated. The results for many variables in this study were not conclusive. Am ong the risk factors that did not prove to be significant after co rrection for multiple testing, a substantial proportion will be statistical noise, though that proportion could be somewhat smaller than the corrected inferences suggested. Moderate correlations among many of the risk factors may have made our multiple testing correction slightly conservative 51. Hence, the evidence for variables such as 'alcohol use', or the health belief that 'immunosuppression is needed to keep the kidney' is stronger than suggested in table 3, especially because these particular variables have previously already been associated to non-adherence 14 18 29. Variables on the other ha nd for which evidence is weaker are the many symptom experience items. Contra-intuitively to the theoretical framework 28, symptoms that appeared in the si mple modeling results were not the most frequently occurring or the most distressing symptoms 49 71. Because earlier studies did not do item specific analysis , we cannot compare our results to earlier findings. It would therefore be worthwhile to try to replicate these results on older symptom data using the same data analysis techniques we used for this study 53. Prevalence and risk factors of non-adherence 72 To conclude, we tested an ex tensive number of potential risk factors of non-adherence with immunosuppressive medication in adult kidney transplant patients on a stable medication regimen, and found a number of variables useful in detecting non- adherence or enhancin g adherence. Higher self-efficacy, pill bo x use, being female, and being in the beginning of the work we ek were unequivocally associated with higher adherence. Also, self-reported non-adherence proved to be useful in tracing non-adherence problems. Given the high adhe rence in our sample, the results of this study are especially relevant for simila r drug-disease combinations, like heart transplant or HIV treatments. Reference list 1.

Non-adherence differences between countries 77 5. NON-ADHERENCE WITH IMMUNO SUPPRESSIVE DRUGS IS HIGHER IN NORTH AMERICAN COMPARED TO EUROPEAN RENAL TRANSPLANT PATIENTS Kris Denhaerynck, Ariane Desmyttere, Fabi enne De Geest In press : Progress in Transplantation Non-adherence differences between countries 78 5.1. Introduction Non-adherence with immunosuppressive medication negatively impacts clinical and economical outcomes in renal transplantation and has therefore become under increased scrutiny 1-14. A recent comprehensive review from our group on non- adherence in renal transplantation 12 reports that the prevalence of non-adherence with immunosuppressive drugs ranges from 2% to 67% depending on the case finding methods, measurement methods, and operational definitions used. The weighted mean of non-adherence with immunosuppressive drug s over different publications is 27.7%. Non-adherence is an etiological factor in 16.3% of the graft losses and 19.9% of the late acute rejections in re nal transplant recipients 12. Studying underlying dynamics and factors linked to non-adherence with immunosuppressive drugs in re nal transplantation provides important information to develop strategies to identify patients at risk and develop adherence enhancing interventions. Correlates, determinants or risk factors for non-adherence can be categorized using the recently published WH O taxonomy. This taxonomy consists of 5 groups of factors: (1) socio-demographic factors, (2) patient related factors, (3) condition related factors, (4) treatment related factors and (5) health care team and health care system related factors 11. The relationship between the 4 first categories and non-adherence with the immunosuppressive regimen has been explored to some extent in transplant populations 12 13 15. Yet, the last category of health care team and health care system related factors ha s received limited attention so far. System factors can be explored at the micro, meso and macro level. The micro level refers to patient-provider interaction such as for instance the quality of the patient provider relationship and communication style. The relationship between the health care provider and the patient is an overlooked variable when trying to understand non- adherence in transplant populations. To our knowledge, only Wolff et al. 16 identified barriers for effective patient provider interact ion in view of adhere nce in a qualitative study focusing on pediatric transplant recipients. More specifically, they identified following risk factors for non- adherence: insufficient information regarding health and treatment (40%); no communication abou t non-adherence (34%); health care providers have given up and rendered th e responsibility for no n-adherence to the patient (34%); loss of trust in doctors (33%); feeling of not being taken seriously (24%); patients do not want to bother health care providers or health care providers do not want to be called in case of questi ons (21%); and loss of praise for adherence achievements (20%)16. System factors at the meso level relate to characteristics of the transplant center. A center-specific effect in view of clinical outcome was observed among European heart transplant centers 17, although this finding has not be en confirmed in lung transplant centers18. Weng et al19 o b s e r v e d a c e n t e r e f f e c t i n v i e w o f p r e v a l e n c e o f n o n - adherence with immunosuppressive drugs among renal transplant centers participating in a multi-site study. Non-adherence wa s assessed by electronic monitoring, and analyses were controlled for other potential influencing factors. Yet, these authors did not explore potential underlying dynamics explaining this center effect, such as for instance the provision of cont inuity of care, the skill mix of teams, time pressures and time constraints of overworked health care providers and support of health care providers to patients in view of self management and behavioral support 11 20. There are indeed some indications in the transplant literature showing that lack of continuity Non-adherence differences between countries 79 of care and decreased supervision were positively related with higher non-adherence. More specifically, distance from the transplant center 21-24 and not being under direct supervision of the transplant team 25 26 were found to be positively correlated with non- adherence. Wolff et al. 16 a l s o f o u n d t h a t l a c k o f t i m e o f h e a l t h c a r e p r o v i d e r w a s perceived as a risk factor for non-adherenc e in pediatric renal transplant patients. Variability of prevalence rates in view of non-adherence with th e immunosuppressive regimen among health care system s suggests that factors at the macro level might also be associated with non-adherence. More specifically, prevalences of non-adherence with immunosuppressive therapy in studies including European patients range from 13% to 36% 3 4, and studies including US patients range from 2% to 55% 1 9 21 27-33, respectively. These data suggest a somewhat higher level of non-adherence in US patients. However, the wide variety in methodologies used prevents firm conclusions. Further research is needed to substantiate if being a patient in the US is indeed associated with a high er probability of being non-ad herent compared to being a patient in Europe. The purpose of this study was therefore twofold: 1) to assess if there exists a difference in the prevalence of self-reported non-adherence with immunosuppressive regimen between European and North American kidney transplant recipients, and 2) to explore differences in prevalence of non-adherence among recipients of different European countries. This study thus focuses on the macro level of system factors by exploring possible variation among different health care systems. 5.2. Methodology 5.2.1. Design and sample This descriptive comparative study pooled data from 3 independently performed, yet methodologically similar cross-sectional, desc riptive, multi-center studies conducted in North America 32 34 and Western Europe (Belgium / The Netherlands and Switzerland) 35 36, respectively. Data collection for th e North-American study was performed between June 1995 and December 1995, in 56 U.S. renal transplant centers 32. Patients were 18 years or older, taking cyclosporine, and having a functioning renal graft. Of the 3000 renal transplant recipien ts approached, 1563 (52.1%) returned valid questionnaires. Data collection for the Belgian / Dutch study took place during the period December 1999 to December 2000, in three renal transplant centers: two in Belgium (the University Hospitals of Leuven and the Univer sity Hospital St-Luc in Brussels) and one in the Netherlands (the Academic Hospital of Maastricht). This study was part of a wider investigation on quality of lif e of renal transplant recipients 35. Patients in this study were all 18 years or older, Dutch- or French-speaking, literate, at least 6 months post-transplant, taking immunosuppressive drugs including tacrolimus for at least 6 months, and being followed-up at one of the participating transplant centers. Exclusion criteria were re-transplantation and multiple organ transplantation. Of the 350 patients approached, 272 (77.7%) returned valid questionnaires. Data collection for the Swiss study (SMART) took place from June 2001 to December 2004 in the Kantonsspital Aarau an d the University Hospital Basel 36. This study assessed subclinical non-adhe rence with the immunosuppressive regimen in adult renal transplant recipients who were at least 1 year post-transplantation, 18 years or older, literate, French- or German-speaking, and receiving post-transplant follow-up at one of Non-adherence differences between countries 80 the participating centers. Exclusion criteria were patients being unable to read the questionnaires when using glasses, lack of mental clarity and not being able to manage the medication independently. Of the 413 e ligible patients, 342 (82.8%) patients gave informed consent and returned valid questionnaires. 5.2.2. Variables and measurement methods All three studies used similar methodology to assess non-adherence with the immunosuppressive regimen 32. Non-adherence was assessed by self-report using one item from the Siegal scale 37 assessing the taking dimension of medication taking. Patients scored how often in the past four weeks they had not taken their immunosuppressive drugs on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 'never forgotten' (score 0) to 'forgotten every day' (score 5) . Because the distribution of answer patterns was skewed, answers were dichotomized. Patients reporting 'never forgotten' their immunosuppressive drugs during the last 4 weeks (score 0) were considered to be adherent similar to the scoring of the original Siegal scale 37. Patients were considered to be non-adherent if they forgot their immunosuppressive medication at least once during the past four weeks (score 1-5) 32. This admittedly stringent definition of non- adherence was based on the well known underreporting of non-adherence associated with self-report 38. Moreover, evidence from the renal and the heart transplant population shows that already minor deviations from dosing schedule are associated with an increased risk fo r poor clinical outcome 9 39, substantiating the choice of this stringent cut-off. No validity, reliability or diag nostic value of the Siegal sc ale has been reported by the researchers who developed the instrume nt. Our research group assessed the diagnostic value of the 4 item Siegal sc ale in the Swiss adherence study in renal transplantation36 using electronic monitoring as gold standard 40. Non-adherence as assessed with the 4-item Siegal scale was defined as any deviation from perfect adherence on 1 of the 4 items. Diagnostic va lues were following: sensitivity: 25.7%; specificity 89.6%; Likelihood ratio of a po sitive test result: 2.5 and area under the curve was 0.576 40. These results show the well know n characteristics of self-report measures of non-adherence in that they underreport non-adherence 41. In addition to non-adherence, selected demographic (i.e. gender, age and level of education) and clinical variables (i.e. numbe r of transplants received, type of donor, months post-transplantation, and presence of diabetes me llitus), were also recorded. The operational definition of educational level needed to be standardized between European and U.S. patients. This was done by categorizing patients as those with 'very low educational level' referring to a less- than-high school educational level; 'low educational level' meaning a high school education; and 'medium / high educational level' referring to a post-high school or professional degree 40. Since the sample included patients speaking French, Du tch and German, the original English questionnaire was translated in these resp ective languages usin g the adapted Brislin protocol 41. 5.2.3. Data collection In all three studies, patients were approached by a member of the research team either during an outpatient clinic fo llow-up appointment or by phone. The questionnaires were filled out by the patien t at home and sent back in pre-stamped Non-adherence differences between countries 81 and pre-addressed envelopes. All three studies had been approved by the respective local ethics committees. 5.2.4. Data analysis Demographic and clinical characteristics, and prevalence of non-adherence were summarized for the respective samples usin g appropriate descriptive measures based on the measurement level and the distribution of the respective variables. Univariable analyses used to compare renal transplant recipients regarding the demographic and clinical factors and non-adherence were chi-square test and student t-test as appropriate. These analyses were performed using the statistical program SPSS, version 9.0 for Windows. Level of significance was set at 0.05. In order to discuss the independent effect of continent on prevalence of non- adherence, multivariable analysis was perfor med using logistic regression with a single random effect. For this analysis, patients within each center were assumed to be correlated, whereas data from patients from different centers were assumed to be independent observations. To model the probability of patient non-adherence, 'mixed' models were used with center as a random effect and all other predictors as fixed effects. These models were fit using the NLMIXED procedure in SAS version 8.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC), with optimization by a conjugate gradient method. A multiple logistic regression fit without center as an effect was used to provide suitable starting values for optimizing the mixed model with center as a random effect. 5.3. Results 5.3.1. Demographic and clinical characteristics in European and U.S. samples European and American patients differed on most demographic and some clinical characteristics (table 1). More specifically, the U.S. sa mple was younger, had a higher percentage of females, was better educated, and comprised a higher proportion of patients with more than one transplant than the European sample (table 1). Furthermore, U.S. patients had a shorter post-transplant status compared to European patients, and a higher propor tion suffered from diabetes mellitus. The type of donor was similar for both U.S. and European patients. 5.3.2. Non-adherence in European compared to U.S. patients In the European sample, 13.2% of responde nts reported medication non-adherence in the last four weeks compared to 19.3% of U.S. respondents (p<0.001). Because differences between groups, the following demographic and clinical factors (table 1) were controlled for in multivariable analyses : gender, age, educational level, number of transplants received, type of donor, presence of diabet es mellitus, and time post- transplantation. A mixed model using center as a random effect and all other factors as fixed effects showed higher non-adhere nce with immunosuppre ssive drugs in U.S patients compared to European patients (O R=1.78; 95%CI: 1.10-2.89; p=0.019) (table 2).

Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first study th at assessed if health care system related correlates at the macro level are associated with non-adherence with immunosuppressive drugs in tr ansplantation. This study pooled findings from studies with similar methodology and showed that no n-adherence is higher in North-American compared to European patients 1 9 21 27-33. Moreover, variability was observed in non- adherence rates among European countries, with Belgium showing higher non- adherence in multivariable analysis. Limited other empirical evidence of non-transplant populations confirms the higher prevalence of non-adherence in U.S. patients. Using structured interviews, Cerveri et al. 42 compared non-adherence between U.S., Dutch and Belgian patients, and found a significantly higher level of adherence in Be lgian and Dutch patients compared to U.S. patients 42. A comparison of appointment non-ad herence between U.S., Japanese and Swedish hemodialysis patients also found higher non-adherence rates in the U.S. population 43. Hecking et al. 44 compared non-adherence rates among European dialysis patients in France (20 units-672 pts), Germany (21-571), Italy (20-600), Spain (20-576), UK (20-620) in view of skipping or shortening behavior of dialysis sessions. Variability in non-adherence study did not include one of the countries we studied. The question that emerges when observing this variability in adherence rates among countries is which potential underlying dynami cs at the macro level might explain this variability of non-adherence? It could be hypo thesized that differences in health care system characteristics, such as for instance health insurance coverage and regulations on the reimbursement of (immunosuppressive) drugs or medical treatment, might be Non-adherence differences between countries 85 important for the observed higher rate in non-adherence between the US and Europe. The importance of health insurance as a po tential influencing factor in view of non- adherence was already suggested by Butkus et al., showing that non-adherence was higher in black uninsured renal transplant patients in the US 33. European countries have compulsory health insurance with prov ides easier access and equity in care. Moreover, the reimbursement of immunosuppressive drugs, even long-term after transplantation, is more favorable, wit h some countries comp letely reimbursing immunosuppressive drugs (Belgium & the Netherlands) and other countries requiring a limited percentage of co-pay ments (Switzerland). This is quite different from the US health care system where financial problems have been identified as the most important factor in non-adherence in heart transplant recipients 45 46. Yet, an increasing number of patients in Europe also report that the financial burden becomes heavier as the medication regimen (other drugs) and follow-up after transplantation necessitates co-payments. In a study in Switzerland 19% of the patients reported that did not have enough finances to pay the medication (SMART study, unpublished findings 22). Explaining possible dynamics among European countries is more challenging given that the health care systems are more similar. One could speculate that trans-cultural factors, especially with regard to specific illness beliefs, might differ among patients from different countries. Previous work in the US and Switzerland showed the importance of these health beliefs as a correlate of non-adherence 32 36. Future research should try to further eluc idate which system fact ors at micro, meso and macro level are important in explaining non-adherence with immunosuppressive drugs in transplant populations. Attentio n should also be given at unraveling the underlying dynamics. This information is cr ucial to develop and implement adherence enhancing interventions. Mo re specifically, informatio n concerning the relative importance of patient-provider relationship , overworked health care providers, weak capacity of system to educate and follow-up patients, and limited community support provides clue in this direction. A more pronounced focus on system factors in developing adherence enhancing intervention s is also suggested by the chronic illness literature indicating that prov iding care within an acute care model to a chronic patient population results in poor outcomes and higher costs 11 47. It has been argued that system change towards a chronic care model that integrates medical, psychosocial and behavioral dimensions of transplant manage ment, that guarantees continuity of care, that places a strong emphasis on patient's active role and adequate self-management and that employs health care workers who have the necessary skills for behavioral management results in favorable patient outcomes 11 47. 5.5. Limitations of the study Some limitations of this study merit discussion. From a methodological point of view, it needs to be mentioned that we pooled data of studies differencing in the timing of data collection, inclusion and exclusion criter ia, and response rates. The fact that the Belgian / Dutch study included renal transplant patients with a minimum of 6 months after their first transplantation only, while th e Swiss study included all renal transplant patients minimum 1 year post-transplant and the U.S. study included simply all transplant recipients with a functioning graft, explains both the difference in number of transplants received and the difference in time after transplantation. Differences in type of donor among countries confirm the known differences in living related donation in different countries 48. Yet, when controlling for thes e differences in multivariable analysis, the differences in non-adherence persisted. Non-adherence differences between countries 86 We do not think that the different data collection points in the three pooled studies have influenced our findings. Adherence seems rather stable over time in the absence of intervention 11, and therefore we do not expect that the different data collection periods will have introduced a major bias into the current study. A different time of data collection will certainly involve differ ences in prescribed immunosuppressive medication. It is not expected that the use of different immunosuppressive medication had an influence on adherence levels in the respective studie s. However, further research is needed to explore the relationship between adherence behavior and the type of immunosuppressive medication. Concer ning differences in response rates, we could hypothesize that the lower response rate in the U.S. sample hides in fact even a higher prevalence of non-adherence, as non-adherent patients might have been unwilling to participate in the study. A further limitation of this study is that non-adherence was measured by self-report, which is known to underestim ate non-adherence, because of memory bias and / or untruthful answer patterns 41,51. Self-report also does no t allow the detection of patterns of medication taking behavior; this is in contrast to the more reliable electronic event monitoring 49. Observed differences in non-adherence could be due to differences in the willingness of U.S. and Euro pean patients to disclose non-adherence by self-report, yet, there is no empirical ev idence available to su pport this hypothesis to date, neither in transplant nor in non-transplant patient populations. We used a single item of the 4 item Siegal sc ale as only this item was used in all three studies we pooled. This item assessed th e most important dimension of medication taking behavior. Admittedly, we can not report specific validity data for this single item. As mentioned above we did preliminary validation work for the 4 item scale using electronic monitoring as gold standard as part of the Swiss renal transplant study 40. Future work could focus on determinening the diagnostic value of the separate and combined items of the Siegal scale. It is perhaps important to mention our finding that a conglomerate measure of non-adherence with the immunosuppressive regimen combining information of self-report, colla teral report of the clinicians and assay showed the best validity using electr onic monitoring as gold standard 40. This finding is congruent with a recent review on adherence to medication 41. The feasibility of using such a conglomerate measure or even better using electronic monitoring is however limited in large scale adherence studies. In these large scale studies a trade off needs to be found between feasibility and accura cy of measurement. Our experience with adherence assessment as part of the Swiss HIV cohort study might be illustrative in this regard 52. We assessed non-adherence using two self report items in 3607 patients. One item assessed the taking dimension of medication taking, the second the presence of drug holidays. Definition of non-adherence was simila r to our transplant study, i.e. at least 1 dose missed in the pa st 4 weeks. We could establish validity based on a strong correlation between the taking adherence item and the proportion of patients virally suppressed in the past 6 months 52. A next limitation of our study is the lack of variation of our sample with regard to the number of included centers in Europe, the used immunosuppressive regimens (due to inclusion criteria in the US, Belgian and Du tch studies), and the inclusion of patients from different ethnic origins in the Euro pean samples (due to language related inclusion criteria). This prevented us to control for immunosu ppressive regimen and ethnic origin. Since the literature suggests that non-adherence is higher in non-white kidney transplant patients 1 21 30 50, this may have led to an underrepresentation of persons with a low income and socio-economic status in our sample, factors known to Non-adherence differences between countries 87 be associated with non-adherence behavior 11. It would, with regard to enhancing sample representativene ss, be worthwile to include more individuals of foreign origin in future European studies. 5.6. Conclusion To our knowledge, our study is the first de monstrating a higher probability of US renal transplant recipients to be non-adherent compared to European patients, suggesting macro level dynamics influencing non-adherenc e. The differences point to the potential importance of health care systems or other system factors in explaining non-adherence behavior. Hypothesized pathways through which the health care system might influence adherence are at the policy le vel (macro level) as well as at the organizational level (meso and micro level). F u t u r e r e s e a r c h i s needed investigating these pathways that might explain differences in non-adherence with immunosuppressive medication. Reference list 1.

Main considerations Adherence to medication regimens is incr easingly recognized as a requirement for optimal treatment outcomes. Particularly in people with chronic diseases, where life- long commitment to a prescribed medication therapy is a precondition for a successful treatment result, non-adherence can have detrimental health effects 2. Living with a kidney transplant is a chronic condition that requires an almost perfect adherence to the immunosuppressive therapy to prevent graft deterioration. Despite the dangers related to less than perfect adherence, ma ny kidney recipients show non-adherence and are thus at risk for rejection episodes or graft loss 3 4. The program of research described in this dissertation aimed primarily to investigate risk factors of non-adherence to immunosupp ressive medication. In our main study, we screened a large number of non-adherence ri sk factors derived from literature, and used electronic monitoring (EM), the most se nsitive method available to date, to assess medication non-adherence. The sample, the largest ever drawn in transplantation research on non-adherence, consisted of kidney transplant patients on stable immunosuppressive medication. Of all tested risk factors, relatively few were significan tly related to non-adherence. The ones that were (i.e., gender, weekday, self-reported adherence, self-efficacy, experiencing spots, pillbox use), showed re lationships of moderate strength. The most predictive variable for non-adherence as assessed with EM was self-reported non- adherence, which can be considered as an assessment of past behavior, generally a good predictor of future behavior 5. A number of reasons may explain the failure of our study to convincingly corroborate the results of past risk factors studies to a larger extent. Specific methodological characteristics of our study, which differed in several aspects from the typical adherence study in kidn ey transplantation, may provide a first explanation. We found an exceptionally high average adhere nce, which limited variability and therefore statis tical power but also compro mized the generalizability of the results (risk factors for non-adherence may differ in high-adherence compared to low-adherence samples). Moreov er, unlike most other risk factor studies, adherence was assessed electronically and not by self -report, two methods known to result in different risk factor profiles wh en tested on identical samples 6-8. Many of the risk factor findings reported hitherto in the literature may not be reproducible in EM studies. Second, our divergent results may be explained by the following three issues in adherence research transplantation: 1. Adherence research in transplantation declares statistical artifacts as risk factors 2. Adherence research in transplantat ion rarely uses behavioral theory to guide research 3. Adherence research in transplantatio n does not take context variables into account Discussion 92 1. Adherence research in transplant ation declares statistical artifacts as risk factors The way statistical findings are interpreted in a large part of the transplant adherence literature is misleading. Research papers in the adherence domain seldom report the total number of tested variables, but instead, only significant findings. Because of the fact that less tests are mentioned than actu ally carried out, the reported degrees of freedom do not correspond to the actually ex pended ones, resultin g in underestimated p-values and subsequently profferring scientific discoveries that are in fact sample- specific stochastic noise 9. Moreover, replication research , which allows to confirm or discard previous findings is not very common in the adherence area 6, and thus will not redress the evidence base. It is therefore advisable for future research to clearly state the total number of tests performed, and/or to make sure that type I errors do not accumulate 10 11. 2. Adherence research in transplant ation rarely uses behavioral theory to guide research Although formal theoretical frameworks explaining behavior (thus also adherence) are available from cognitive psychology, and al though these could facilitate understanding the driving forces behind adherence, few studies use such theories to guide selection of risk factors. Theories frequently used in health care are the Health Belief Model 12, the Theory of Planned Behavior 13, and the Social Cognitive Theory 14 15. Recently, these three theories were integrated into an Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction 16 (Figure 2), which states that intentions and environmental or personal constraints are the primary determinants of behavior. Inte ntions are in turn determined by beliefs about social norms, self-efficacy (i.e., beliefs of behavioral control), and attitudes (i.e., covert feelings of favorability or unfavorab ility, e.g. outcome expectancy beliefs, weighings of pros and cons). Other variables have no direct path to behavior and are called distal variables. Fig. 2. The Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction 16 Discussion 93 The Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction could serve as a heuristic tool in the search for risk factors of adherence behavior. Based on this model, it can be expected that attitudes, norms, self -efficacy, or environmental/personal constraints will be the strongest risk factors and that distal vari ables will show less strong associations to behavior. Nevertheless, despite their diluted relationship to adherence, distal variables are the predominant focus of current adherence research. Studies that aim to determine adherence-specific beliefs and/or test if th ese beliefs are related to adherence are rare 17-19. Our study included both beliefs, such as self-efficacy 15 and attitudinal beliefs (i.e., illness representations) 20 and distal variables. Self-efficacy was related to non- adherence. Attitudinal beliefs , on the contrary, were not retained in the final results, which implies that either attitudinal beliefs did not matter in explaining adherence, or that our measurement instrument did not re ally capture adherenc e-critical attitudes 19. The latter is certainly a possibility, because in contrast to the more successful Long- Term Medication Behavior Self-Efficacy Scal e, which was developed based on published qualitative research 18 and was carefully validated 21, the development of the Siegal instrument, which was not base d on qualitative research, ha s never been described in detail. It is therefore difficult to evaluate whether the Siegal scale has sufficient content validity. Because qualitative research is a proper approach for unraveling complex phenomena such as context-dependent adherence behavior 22, it may be used to map lived experiences of medication-taking in kidney transplant patients, and, hence to determine critical attitudinal obstacles to good ad herence, which can form the basis of a content valid attitudes scale. Not much qualitative research has been do ne on attitudes about immunosuppressives. A study by Russell et al. in kidney transplant patients investigated attitudes using semi- structured questions (n=16) 17, finding that most of patients' negative attitudes towards immunosuppressives referr ed to side effects of the drugs. None of the items in our attitudes instrument assessed attitudes towards side effects. We assessed patient perceptions of symptom occurrence an d symptom distress using the Modified Transplant Symptom Occurrenc e and Symptom Distress (MTSOSD) scale to explore the relationship between symptom experience related to side effects of immunosuppressives and adhe rence. We found a limited number of associations. Although the MTSOSD did not really measure attitudes, the relative lack of detected relationships possibly suggests that symptoms were not a major driving factor of adherence in our sample. Futu re research should be conducted, exploring whether the findings of Russell et al. are generalizable and focusing on the development of a more evidence based atti tudes instrument. Normative beliefs, another group of behavioral determinants, were not measured in our study. The qualitative study by Russell et al. also explored norm ative beliefs related to adherence, reporting that patients did not experience a lot of disapproval regarding immunosuppressives intake from their soci al environment. Although this result suggests that norms are of minor importance in explaining adherence, it has to be noted that one of the limitations of this study was that it only included adults. The effect of norms on adherence might be more relevant in adolescents. Adolescents There is nothing as practical as a good theory - Kurt Lewin 1 Discussion 94 suffering from chronic disease are a risk group for non-adherence 23. Being normal and autonomous is important for adolescents, however, medication taking may remind them of having a chronic disease (=not bein g normal), induce avoidance coping and, hence, non-adherence 23. Future research could give a decisive answer. Self-efficacy was also assessed in our study, and al though it appeared as one of the most powerful predictors of non-adherence, there is probably still room for improvement in view of the explanatory power of this belief. The variability measured with the Long-term Medication Behavior Se lf-Efficacy scale is constrained by an apparent ceiling effect (i.e., almost all pa tients mark the maximum score on every item, implying that they had very high confidence in their ability to handle the presented taxing situation). The high self -efficacy noted in our study reflects the sample's high adherence, but also the fact that items may not adequately represent the right challenges the patients face. An extensive discussion of the possible causes and remedies of this ceiling effect may be found in previous work published by our group 21. Among the distal variables i n c l u d e d i n o u r s t u d y , s o m e were significantly related to non-adherence: gender, weekday, self-repor ted non-adherence, graft type, busyness and pillbox use. According to the Integrativ e Model of Behavioral Prediction, distal variables are associated to adherence throug h mediation by one of the driving forces of adherence, be it beliefs or constraints . Although this study was not designed to explore the exact causal paths that link distal variable s to adherence, it sh ed some light on the way the significant distal variables could affect adherence. Some correlated with adherence through a supposed beliefs infl uence, others through constraints. 1. Beliefs. A variable that showed an associat ion to adherence through an assumed correlation with self-efficacy an d/or attitudinal beliefs is 'graft type'. Living (related) graft recipients often show a lower adhere nce than recipients of a deceased donor graft 19 24 25, which may reflect the fact that these persons have a lower self-efficacy and a weaker belief that immunosuppressives are important. 2. Constraints. Variables that showed an association to adherence through an assumed effect on 'personal skills and abilities' are 'pillbox use' and 'busyness', and probably also 'weekday'. The most probable c ausal path is that 'pillbox use' decreases and 'busyness' increases a person's appeal on memory, thereby influencing a non- intentional driver of behavior, namely forgetfulness. The path of 'weekday' is less obvious, but it might be related to the effect of routine in daily life (e.g. adherence is lowest during the weekend, when lives are less structured and, hence, reliance on memory is higher). An issue supporting the importance of forgetfulness as major driver of non-adherence is that patients in many studies rank forget fulness as the most important reason for non-adherence 26-29. Likewise, 66% of patients self-reporting non- adherence in our study mentioned forgetfuln ess as reason. Another issue supporting the importance of constraints comes from th e fact that self-eff icacy showed a more convincing relationship to adherence than atti tudinal beliefs (if we take for granted that the Siegal scale measured the right attitudes). Self-efficacy reflects one's perceived ability to cope with constraints. If constraint s are a major driver of non-adherence, it can indeed be expected that the confidence to adhere despite constraints (= self- efficacy) will be positively related to adherence. Discussion 95 Thus, our findings suggest that non-intent ional factors are a major driver of non- adherence. Non-intentional factors possibly explain more of adherence behavior than intentional beliefs do, which may be a reason for the observed high adherence level in our EM study. High adherence could namely reflect the relative absence of intentional non-adherence. The results of our study are therefore not automatically relevant for populations with a typically lower adhere nce level (e.g. hypertension patients 21). This hypothesis, that non-intentional factors are more important than intentional factors in explaining non-adherence in kidney transpla ntation should be in vestigated further. 3. Adherence research in transplantation does not take context variables into account Context is an important but mainly neglec ted aspect of the daily reality in which adherence behavior takes place. In the Integrative Model of Behavioral Prediction, context is mentioned under the distal variable category 'culture'. Culture is, however, only one aspect of context. Context refers to any higher-level variables that exert a possible influence down to the individual subject level. An example may clarify the concept of 'conte xt'. In many scientific disciplines it became clear that behavior of study su bjects cannot be explained well if the characteristics of the system of which they are part ar e neglected. In pedagogical research for instance, it ha s long be acknowledged that explaining achievements of pupils requires not only taking into account pupil-related variable s such as intelligence, motivation, or self-efficacy, but also higher level variables like teaching style, school atmosphere, and educational system 30. These variables reflect a system's emergent properties not reducible to individual-level characteristics. Including these emergent variables in a statistical model cont ributes to its explanatory power. Health care system variables like financial burden of immunosuppressive intake for the patient, level of chronic illness management in a setting, trust in health care workers, or communication style of health care providers might impact patient behavior in much the same way as teaching style or school system do in pupils 31. Like school performance, adherence behavior is bound to and fundamentally influenced by the social environment in which it is stimulat ed (or not stimulated). Patients in one environment may have different contextual experiences from patients \"nested\" in other environments, a reality requiring design and analysis adaptations that only recently have entered the mainstream 32 33. Congruent with research in sociology, pedagogy, and economy, it is time that health research abandons the idea that patient behavior originates in a social vacuum. Statistical practice should reflect this nested social reality by involving higher level variables and use the currently available analytical techniques to fit such models. By performing the meta-analysi s reported in chapter four, our research group is among the first to carefully examine non-adherence ri sk factors at both the level of individual patients and the systems in which they receive their care 34. This meta-analysis needs to be regarded as a pilot project to explor e the feasibility of undertaking a multi-level study on possible differences in adherence in kidney transplant patients treated in different health care systems. We are planni ng a multi-center study in the near future to investigate the impact of different macro- and meso-level charac teristics of health care on patient adherence. This study, wh ich will draw a clustered convenience sample of heart transplant centers in the US and Europe and will be perfor med in collaboration with the Center for Health Services and Nursing Research at the Catholic University of Discussion 96 Leuven and with the International Transplant Nursing Society, will include meso-level variables like composition and skill mix of the multidisciplinary team and level of implementation of chronic illness management , communication style of the health care worker, trust in the treating physician, next to macro-level data such as hospital system, type of health insurance, or organization of the pharmacy system. 6.2. Intervention research A better understanding of adherence, which ma y result from addressing the three main shortcomings of adherence research in tran splantation (statistical, theoretical, and multi-level) should contribute to the development of more targeted adherence- enhancing interventions and the improvement of transplant outcomes. Adherence intervention research is limit ed in transplantation. Some adherence- enhancing intervention strategies have been described 35-38. Only two studies formally tested interventions to improve adherence to immunosuppressives in the transplant population 39 40, These interventions, as well as systematic reviews summarizing intervention studies in other chronic-, and acute-care populations (meta-analyses 41 42; narrative reviews 43-45) might be used to develop future interventions. Improved adherence is a difficult goal to attain, especially for long-term medication treatments. The best results are achieved by complex approaches combining educational, cognitive behavioral, and social support intervention s at multiple levels (e.g. interventions towards health care profession als or realizing changes in the health care system) over a sustained time that target more than one risk factor 43 46. Studies based on strong theory or conceptual framew orks likely will contribute to more effective adherence interventions. Few interventions are theory based. Our study used the self-efficacy concept as a conceptual basis. Using theoretical models such as the self-efficacy theory or the Integrative Model will, ho wever, probably not be suffic ient to induce behavioral change. Extending the explanatory theoretical models with evidence from behavioral change research is therefore advisable. Behavioral change models, such as the Stages of Change model 47, provide greater detail of how to get people to change their beliefs and eventually, their behavior. Attempts to combine the Integrative Model and the Stages of Change model have already been undertaken 48. Such integrations could be useful for designing future intervention programs. 6.3. Electronic medication monitoring I n a d d i t i o n t o t h e m a i n g o a l o f t h i s d i s s e r t a t i o n , i . e . m a p p i n g r i s k f a c t o r s o f n o n -adherence, we also focused on a methodological issue, namely the measurement of non-adherence. We developed a framework for validating EM, contribution to adherence research as no systematic atte mpt to validate the EM system has been carried out in its two decades of existence. We demonstrated the existence of an intervention effect of EM, after almost 20 years of related debate in the literature. Recent statistical techniques allowed us to map time- dependent medication dynamics in a multivariable way (i.e., generalized linear and generalized additive models). As outlined in appendix 1, th ere remains room for improvem ent in using the generalized linear model technique for longitudinal stud ies. A recent replication test of this intervention effect by our group in HIV patients confirmed our findings in transplant patients, thereby supporting the external validity of the results presented in this dissertation 49. Discussion 97 Aside from the intervention effect, we also found that failing technology and mismatches between pill intakes and bottl e openings may bias EM measurement. Mismatches have the farthest reaching implicat ions for setting up future EM studies. Its bias can be largely prevented by offering patients an option to register mismatches between pill intakes and an by assessing their adherence to the EM guidelines. Patients showing major non-adherence to the EM guidelines should be excluded to prevent that missing data from not using EM are consid ered to reflect non-adherence. To what extent these excluded patients differ from those not excluded remains to be examined. 6.4. Final summary S u m m a r i z e d , w e c o n c l u d e t h a t r e s e a r c h o n r i s k f a c t o r s o f n o n - a d h e r e n c e i n k i d n e y transplantation can still be improved, both content-wise and methodologically. Research should be more guided by behavior al theory, and should consider effects of the social system in which patients are care d for. Our research group will take the lead in investigating this latter research area by setting up an international multi-center study with the goal to explore higher-level system correlates of (non-) adherence. Our hope is that this will lead to an enhanced understanding of adherence behavior, so that health care professionals get a better grip on non-adherence and its detrimental consequences.

APPENDIX 1: VALIDATION OF THE RANDOM -EFFECTS MODEL Despite having advantages over previously proposed methods to analyse EM data in a longitudinal way 1 2, generalized Linear Mixed Models (e.g., random-intercepts logistic regression analysis) have their own drawbacks. Results are unbiased if certain assumptions are not violated. Overdispersion and serial dependency are two processes that may violate these assumptions. 7.1. Overdispersion Logistic regression assumes binomial errors, with estima ted variance (y) = m(1 - m), where m is the estimated mean residual. \"O verdispersion\" occurs when the observed variance of the residuals is greater than the expected variance, and indicates misspecification of the model, non-random sa mpling, or an unexpected distribution of the variables. As a result, standard errors will be over-optimistic, leading to confidence intervals that are too wide. Ex amination of overdispersion can be done using the GLMM procedure from the 'lme4' package that runs on the statistical R-platform 3. The program GLMM procedures fits a Generalized Linear Mixed Model by estimating the maximal likelihood with Laplaci an approximation to the marg inal likelihood instead of by using numerical quadrature as the NLMIXED procedure in SAS does. Fitting a model as the one presented in table 3 on page 50, showed that the estimated dispersion parameter approached the theoretically expected value of 1, suggesting that the model fit the data well. 7.2. Serial dependency One drawback of Generalized Linear Mixed Model procedures is that they assume independence of observations within one patient, an assumption that might be violated in longitudinal studies, beca use observations closer in ti me generally resemble more than observations further away 4. To detect whether such a serial dependency occurred in our study, we performed a runs test on each patient's binary adherence sequence. Runs tests allo w to control if a binary sequence is random. A runs test could be performed in 182 patien ts of the 249 patients with EM data. After controlling for multiple testing 5, 11 sequences differed significantly from random (q<0.05), suggesting serial dependency. The size of the runs test's p-value highly correlated with the taking adherence para meter (Spearman's rho=0.60), suggesting that serial dependency became worse when patients were more adherent. Redoing the main analysis of the EM-validation study while omitting all patients that had a runs test p-value <0.05 did not change the results as presented in table 3 on page 50, nor in terms of estimates, nor in terms of inferenc es. This result indicates reality is more complex than today's available modelling techniques can capture, but that the existence of serial dependency did not lead to bias. Reference list 1.

Background and aim of the research program Non-adherence to the immunosuppressive therapy is an important issue in kidney transplant patients. About 20% of the kidney transplant patients are non-adherent to the immunosuppressive regimen. Non-adhere nce contributes to 20% of late acute rejection episodes and 16% of the graft losses, and results in a decreased number of quality adjusted life years. A strategy to in crease long-term succ essful outcome after transplantation is to identify patients at ri sk for non-adherence an d to target them for preventive and adherence enhancing interventions. Comprehensive research on risk factors of non-adherence addressing socio- economic, patient-, condition-, therapy-, and health care system/worker-related factors is lacking. Especially health care-related risk factors are understudied. Moreover, existing studies are hampered by a number of methodological shortcomings. An important shortcoming is that accurate measurement methods for detecting non-adherence, such as electronic monitoring (EM) are rarely adopted. EM, currently the most sensit ive adherence assessment method, uses microchip technology to register date and ti me of openings of a pill bottle. Although EM's superior sensitivity to detect non-adherence makes it a potential gold standard of adherence assessment, the lack of thorough validation as well as the lack of use of appropriate statistical methods for multivariabl e and/or longitudinal data analysis of EM data, hinder progress in the field. The main purpose of this research program was to determine prevalence and risk factors of non-adherence to immunosuppre ssive medication in kidney transplant patients. As an additional purpose, we aimed to improve the validity of EM measurement by mapping assumptions underlying correct EM measurement. We tested these assumptions on adherence data of kidney transplant patients. 8.2. Methods 8.2.1. Prevalence and risk factors of non-adherence To study prevalence and risk factors of non-adherence to immunosuppressives, we conducted a prospective stud y, in which we measured adherence by EM over a 3- month period in 250 adult renal transplant patients sampled from two outpatient transplant centers in Switzerland. We calc ulated period prevalences of adherence and expressed them as the percentage of prescribed doses taken (taking adherence), the percentage of days with correct dosing (d osing adherence), the percentage of inter- dose intervals not exceeding 25% of the pr escribed interval (timing adherence), and the number of drug holidays per 100 days (>48h no intake if once; >24h if twice daily intake). Selected risk factors were socio-economic, therapy related (e.g. number of transplantations, use of medication aids, symptom occurrence and distress), patient related (e.g. self-efficacy, he alth beliefs, coping styles, busyness, health behaviors), condition related (e.g. depression, substa nce use), and health care system/team related (e.g. regularity of follow up). Testin g of the risk factors occurred by simple mixed logistic regression analysis, using a sequence of daily binary adherence data. Factors significant after correction for multip le testing were entered into a multiple mixed logistic regression model. Summary 104 Because the EM-study was not designed to extensively investigate health care system or health care team-related factors, we pe rformed an additional meta-analysis to look whether non-adherence prevalences differed between continents/countries. This meta- analysis on individual patient data pooled data from three studies in adult kidney transplant patients from the US (n=1563), the Netherlands (n=85), Belgium (n=187) and Switzerland (n=342). Adherence was measured by the Siegal scale, a self-report instrument for measuring non-adherence to immunosuppressives. Patients were categorized as non-adherent if they reported to have missed a dose of immunosuppression in the last 4 weeks. Da ta were analysed using multiple mixed logistic regression with center as a rand om effect and continent/country as fixed effects, while controlling for several demographical and clin ical characteristics of the included samples. 8.2.2. Validation of EM assessment To study the validity of the EM measuremen t, we summarized existing evidence on processes that may bias non- adherence assessment. Unbiased EM assessment requires fulfillment of four validity assumptions, bein g (1) correctly functi oning EM equipment, (2) correspondence of EM-bottle openings to the actual intake of the prescribed dose, (3) absence of influence of EM on a pati ent's normal adherence behavior, and (4) sample representativeness. We examined these four validity assumptions using the above mentioned sample of 250 kidney transplant patients whose adherence was measured by EM. More specifically, we (1) determin ed the prevalence of non-functioning EM systems, (2) examined the impact of patient-reported discrepancies between cap openings and actual drug intakes on period prevalence, (3) explored whether non-adherence increased over time after patients started EM, and (4) screened for differences between participating patients and patients who refused to partic ipate or who dropped out of the study. 8.3. Results Mean taking, dosing, timing adherence and drug holidays per 100 days were 98%, 96%, 93%, and 1.1 days, respectively. Va riables associated with EM measured non- Furthermore, a gradually declining adherence could be ob served between Monday and Sunday (OR= 1.04; 95%CI: 1.02-1.07). The results self-reported non-adherence differences between continents/countries showed that the prevalence of non-adherence to immunosuppressives in the U.S. and Europe was 19.3% and 13.2.%, respectively The higher prevalence of non-adherence in US patients was confirmed in the multiple logistic regression analysis (OR=1.78; 95%CI: 1.10-2.89). More over, non-adherence differed Netherlands (14.1%) of EM showed that not all assumptions underlying EM measurement were fulfilled: (1) one cap malf unctioned, (2) mismatches between bottle Summary 105 openings and actual drug intake occurred in 62% of the patients (n=155), and (3) non-adherence increased during the initial pe riod of the monitoring, primarily during the first 5 weeks, indicating EM had an intervention effect. The bias caused by this 5- week intervention effect was minimal. The effect of mismatches between bottle openings and actual drug intake on the measured adherence prevalence was larger, but could be minimized by correcting the downloaded EM data using patient self- reports (i.e., self-reported adherence to the EM guidelines and notes made by the patient to correct mismatches between openings and ingestions). 8.4. Conclusions This study program aimed to study risk fact ors of non-adherence in kidney transplant patients. Its contribution to the literature lies in the fact that a comprehensive number of non-adherence risk factors, including the currently neglected health care system factors, have been explored, and in the fact that improvements of the methodological approach for adherence studies have been proposed. The profile of risk factor appearing in the final results suggest th at forgetfulness was a major driver of non-adherence. Moreover, system factors might also have an impact on individual adherence behavior, as suggested by the found differences in prevalence of non-adherence between European and US patients and among European patients. These findings may change the focus of adherence research in the transplant population. Methodological improvements put forward throughout this study program primarily concern the measurement of adherence behavior using EM. Novel statistical techniques are proposed that allow multivariate analysis of EM data and inclusion of time-varying variables into the statistical regression mo dels. Besides, we showed that, although assumptions underlying valid EM measurement may be violated, bias can to a certain extent be prevented by correcting incorrect data or omitting them from the analysis.
