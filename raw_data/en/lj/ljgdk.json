A nurse threads her way around the 40 beds jammed into the ward, many of which are occupied by patients whose diseases have progressed so far that their limbs are as thin as the metal tubing that frames the beds. The ward is always full. Two waiting rooms adjacent to it have been converted into makeshift wards themselves, each with 10 beds. Today neither has a free space. \"We're asking for 90 beds,\" says the nurse, who is dressed in a traditional uniform, complete with angled hat. \"But in the future, that's not going to be enough, either.\" In 1987, Thailand was virtually HIV-free. But now an AIDS epidemic is raging in the country, as the crowded ward in San Patong Hospital, 20 kilometers outside Thailand's largest northern city, Chiang Mai, makes clear. Researchers believe that San Patong, a region of rice fields and simple stilt homes, has more HIV-infected people than anywhere else in Thailand. But because there is a long lag time between HIV infection and symptomatic AIDS, San Patong so far has only had a hint of the number of cases it soon will be experiencing. And the rest of the country may not be far behind. Faced with this bleak outlook, Thailand is aggressively looking for ways to thwart HIV. Nowhere is this more pronounced than in the country's emerging role as the most important place in the world for testing AIDS vaccines. \"There's probably more going on here than anywhere,\" says William Heyward, an epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) who is currently working for the World Health Organization...
