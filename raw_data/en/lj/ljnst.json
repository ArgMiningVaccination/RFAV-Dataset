We often see treatments with conventional pathways. However, Hydrosun has the ability to combine a multi-prong treatment approach with the 2 pathways through the power of light and has been clinically proven to be highly efficient in obtaining positive treatment outcomes. Source of Hydrosun Concept Hydrosun is an innovation from Germany, which replicates the light energy from the sun and is also known as the \"Artificial Sun\". It is light therapy that releases high power light and emitting it through the specified directions. It is like a flashlight and produces sun like heat. The reason why natural sunlight, does not make us feel very hot or burn our skin is because by the time the sunlight reaches the skin, it will pass through the atmospheric layer with steam. As the light filter, it makes the light warm and moist. Virtual Artificial Since Hydrosun acts as an artificial sun, a special Water Filter has been design as part of the component and this is a significant element of this therapy. Hydrosun emits red light known as Near Infrared Spectrum. It has a wave length of 760-1,400 nanometers and a relatively high wattage power of 775 watts. Though the equipment can generate intensive heat, rest assure that the heat can be controlled to a conducive level during the therapy so that patients feel comfortable all the time. The light goes through the Water Filter with different lens colors, such as violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, tangerine and red, according to the usage or the doctor's orders. The radio frequency of Near Infrared Spectrum will change according to the color of the Water Filter because each light color will provide different treatment benefits. The treatment process is closely monitored and all necessary safety precautions are taken seriously. Advantages of Heat and Light For those who are curious about the heat from Hydrosun, we would like to compare it to the current model of Infrared Sauna. Many models have an infrared emitter with power of up to 1,000 watts. If using at high level, the external skin will be burned before the body will feel hot, which is different from Hydrosun. With the Water Filter, it allows the light from the Hydrosun to pass through without burning the skin. Significant Advantages from Heat and Light - Helps to stimulate the blood circulation. - Helps to enhance the immune system and stimulate a particular immune response. - Relieve pain and muscular tension, such as backache. - Stimulate wounds to heal better, especially with infected wounds, such as wounds in diabetic patients or patients with hepatitis. Understand the Perspective of Oriental Medicine towards Light Therapy Like oriental medicine, in India, there is the Ayurvedic practices following the Meridian principles, which is similar to Chinese medicine. However, the Ayurvedic Meridian in the axial of body is called \"Chakra\" and is the center of the Meridian Energy. There are 7 points of Meridian Energy on the body and they are as follows: - Chakra 7 Sahassara (The Crown Chakra) is in the middle of the head. It is the chakra with the belief that it is connected with the energy around us and is the center of energy that powers of various chakras in the body. - Chakra 6 Ajana (The Third Eye Chakra) is in the middle of the forehead. It is believed that it is the 3rd eye with the second sight that connects with thoughts, mental relations and awareness. - Chakra 5 Vishuddhi (The Throat Chakra) is about peace, conscious and prudence. - Chakra 4 Anahata (The Heart Chakra) is related with natural growth, hope, and mental matters. - Chakra 3 Manipura (The Pancreas) is the center of the body around the navel, which relates to inspiration, creativity and power. - Chakra 2 Swadhisthana (The Testil & Ovary Chakra) is around the sexual gland, which relates to the Meridian Energy, automatic nervous system, happiness, impulsion and meditation. - Chakra 1 Mooladhara (The Grounding & Physical Stamina) is around the perineum, which relates to the basic impulsions of humans. Conventional Medicine vs. Ayurvedic Medicine All 7 chakras as mentioned above are Ayurveda principles that look at the relationship between the Meridian Energy, body, mind, and soul. If we take a closer look and compare with conventional medicine, we will see that the position of each chakra is around the automatic nervous system of the human body. For example: - Chakra 7 The Crown Chakra is in the position of the pineal gland with the belief that it can connect with various energies that surround us. This is because the pineal gland is the determinant of Hypothalamus that is located deep in the subconscious. It can also control sleep. - Chakra 6 The Third Eye Chakra is in the position of the pituitary gland. It is the pituitary gland that controls the hormone system. Some people believe that it is connected with the second sight, thought, calm hearted and anticipation. - Chakra 5 The Throat Chakra is in the position of the thyroid gland that works to produce hormones and control the body metabolism and body temperature, including moods and emotions. - Chakra 4 The Heart Chakra is in the position of the thymus gland, which is a ductless gland between the lungs that works as with the immune system. - Chakra 3 The Pancreas is in the position of the adrenal gland, which is a ductless gland that produces various significant hormones, such as adrenalin. - Chakra 2 The Testil & Ovary Chakra is in the position of the sexual gland. - Chakra 1 The Grounding & Physical Stamina is in the position of perineum, which is between the reproductive organ and the anus. Hence, Bio Energetic Scan or Quantum Energy Scan in Absolute Health Integrative Medical Center reports the functional results of various organs that are in line with the Ayurvedic Meridian Energy, also known as the 7 Chakras. Distinctiveness of Hydrosun is through the 3 systems functional approach, which are as follows: 1. Conventional Medicine Perspective 2. Chakras Ayurveda Perspective 3. The Work of Light The specifications of Hydrosun will thoroughly explain the benefits of each light color used in the perspective of all 3 systems. For example, the function of red light in Chakra 1 provides the life energy. However, from the conventional medicine perspective, the indicator for the use of red light is to stimulate the energy, blood circulation system and cell energy. Indicators of Hydrosun - Ability to use light as stimulant - Stimulate the Ayurvedic energy - Synergize the mind and soul For example: For treatment of patients with severe abdomen inflammation, the doctor will use the blue light because it can reduce the inflammation. However, in very anxious patients, the yellow light can be used to reduce anxiety. The treatment will emphasize the conventional medicine perspective. In some mental health cases, the Ayurvedic perspective might be used according to suitability, in which case, light therapy by Hydrosun can be used to provide optimal therapeutic benefit to many patient.
