BMS typically have one of the, if not the largest populations of undergraduate students enrolled in our program, with over 1000 students seeking Bachelor of Science degrees. We also have students pursuing Masters of Health Sciences degrees in our program. The national and international re cognition of our research pro- grams and scholarly activities is one of the key elements of our continued student success. Over the years, our research pro-grams have become essential sources for high-impact experien- tial learning and re search experiences for our undergraduates, and the foundation of our graduate program. Furthermore, our research foci on anatomy (e.g. comparative, evolutionary, func-tional and plastination) physiolo (e.g. cardiovascular, ease, immunology and parasitology ), and nutrition (e.g. aging, food design, and public health food access), support a new gen- eration of GVSU graduates commit ted to the public good. Our research programs have direct implications on societal issues associated with global problems, health issues, agricultural im- pacts, and the future of college education, further demonstrat-ing our commitment to the public good. The BMS major deals with the very processes of life, which in turn informs and guides our students in their future practices and professions. This year's BMS Graduates of Distinction were nominated by faculty members because they set themselves apart from their peers, either in the classroom, in the research lab, in service to the university, or in all likelihood a combination of the three. Page 3 In the faculty's opinion, these students in Biomedical Scienc- es major set the academic standard for the rest of the universi-ty to follow. In fact, recognition as one of our Graduates of Distinction in the Biomedical Sciences is an exceptional achievement as they represent the top 2% of the BMS major, and 0.1% of the university. Be ing recognized as a Graduate of Distinction in the Biomedical Sciences is truly an outstand-ing achievement. Graduates of Distinction, we ho pe that you take your educa- tion you received at GVSU, and use it to further develop and integrate that educat ion throughout your careers and lives. You have all worked very hard to get to graduation and will continue to work hard well after you leave Grand Valley. As hard as you've worked, recognize that you have also lucked into plenty, which includes circumstances like your education-al opportunities, your supportive parents (be sure to thank them), your hometown, and your country. To get here today, there was indeed lots of hard work involved, but also some luck was involved too, and wi th recognition of this luck should come an obligation to those not as lucky as us. We owe a debt to the unlucky, the less fortunate to use our GVSU education to be great and help others moving forward in our lives. I can confidently speak for all Biomedical Sciences faculty that we feel privileged and lucky to have had the opportunity to educate, guide, and work with you over these past years.

Page 10 Excellence in a Discipline Biomedical Sciences Excellence in a Discipline - Undergraduate 2021 Awardee: Natalie Rizza In the fall of 2018, I first met Natalie Rizza when she took Human Physiology with me. Earl y in the class, it was obvi- ous to see that she was an ou tstanding student. I was im- pressed with her level of understanding and intuitiveness with very complex topics in physiology. When she expressed an interest in my research la b, I was more than happy to have her join as a member. Natalie has been among the bet-ter undergraduate students that have been a part of my re-search teams. She worked on our research involving nonylphenol, a widely used chem ical that behaves as an es- trogenic mimic in biological systems. Natalie performed de- tailed exposure protocols using the chemical and performed hours of data analysis. As a result of her efforts, she has been an author on multiple post er presentations. She is also working with me to submit a manuscript by semester's ends. Natalie also worked as a Nurse Technician at Spec- trum Butterworth Hospital in the Neurosciences division, and as an EKG technician at Spectrum Health Meijer Heart Center. At GVSU, she was the treasurer for Habitat for Hu- manity and Partnership Representative for the Pre-med Club, and a member of Chemocar e. She volunteered at Al- lendale Middle School tutoring 8th graders and at American Heart Association Heart Walk and Walk for Wishes West Michigan. She also worked at the GVSU Family Health Center. Natalie is pursuing medical school after graduation. -Daniel Bergman Page 11 Biomedical Sciences Excellence in a Discipline - Undergraduate 2021 Awardee: Natalie Rizza Major: Biomedical Sciences Minor: Chemistry Awards/Scholarships: BMS Excellence in a Disci- pline, BMS Graduate of Distinction, Perry BS Core Scholarship, Grand Finish Grant Research: I did research with Dr. Bergman in the crayfish lab conducting trials testing the effects of Nonylphenol toxicity on juvenile crayfish. Clinical Experience: I currently work at Spectrum Health Butterworth Hospital, previously as a Nurse Technician on the Neurosciences Unit, and now as an EKG Technician at Meijer Heart Center . Service: I volunteered at American Heart Associa- tion Heart Walk, Walk-for-W ishes West Michigan, and tutored students in grades K-12. Future Plans: I plan on taking a gap year and work- ing full time at the hospital, as well as continuing to volunteer and shadow, while applying to medical school. Excellence in a Discipline Page 12 Excellence in a Discipline Microbiology Excellence in a Discipline - Undergraduate 2021 Awardee: Blake Newton Blake is the sort of person you would back to be successful in anything he tries. He has worn many hats in his life. He served in the Army Re- serve for 6 years travelling with them to Honduras and Panama. He worked in home maintenance and remodeling and even flipped a house on his own. He later worked in manufacturing and was a pro-duction leader. Now, he is also a student of microbiology! Blake initially went back to school pa rt time before deciding to devote himself full time to his studies . Microbiology appealed to him because it plays a significant part in multiple aspects of the world around us and is widely applicable to many career fields. I first met Blake when he took Bacterial Genetics in the Fall of 2020 and what was obvious from the start was that Blake was a driven and capable student. He can seem quiet but when called on always seems to understand the material and know the answer. When he asked ques-tions, they were always on point. When I asked our other faculty what their experiences of Blake were , they responded \"can seem quiet but asks good questions and gets the job done\" \"his conceptual grasp of the material is outstanding\" \"easily one of the brightest and hardworking students I have ever taught\". Each comment seem to match my experi- ences with Blake. His research project in the Bacterial Genetics lab was one of the harder projects using real-time PCR to anal yze the effects of salt and carbohy- drate source on the expression of glmU in Escherichia coli . This involved dealing with some technical challenges that Blake approached in a very matter of fact and efficient manner. A worthy winner and the first awardee of our excellence in a discipline award for microbiology. Congratulations Blake. -Derek Thomas Page 13 Microbiology Excellence in a Discipline - Undergraduate 2021 Awardee: Blake Newton Major: Microbiology Awards/Scholarships: GV Award for Excellence Scholarship , BMS Graduate of Distinction, GV Grant, Grand Finish Grant, State Competitive Scholarship, 2021 Microbiology Undergraduate Excellence in a Discipline Award Future Plans: My future plans entail starting a ca- reer in either the academic research environment or in industry in order to gain expe rience in the field. During this time, I intend to apply to graduate programs in hu-man genetics. My academic in terests range from can- cer genetics to epigenetics and the role it plays in the aging process. Excellence in a Discipline Page 14 Excellence in a Discipline Biomedical Sciences Excellence in a Discipline - Graduate 2021 Awardee: Hilary Skalski Hilary joined the MHS program in Fall 2018 and first reached out about opportunities in my lab shortly thereaf-ter. I'll always remember her initial email to discuss working together because it was the first time anyone had described ultrasound work on male patients that was related to my work in male reproduction. In fact, she was one of the few that has even known what the epididymis was as an organ prior to joining my lab so, of course, my interest was piqued. Our personalities aligned well and we began to design a pro-ject for her thesis work. Now, ne arly three years later, she is finishing her thesis and preparing to begin a doctoral pro-gram at MSU. Along the way she has performed extremely well in her own coursework, taught multiple courses at GV for the BMS and Sonography programs, and expanded my research into the realm of reproductive immunology. It is a pleasure to have been able to both teach and learn from Hil-ary over these past couple year s. I look forward to following her career as it progresses. Congratulations! -Chris Pearl Page 15 Biomedical Sciences Excellence in a Discipline - Graduate 2021 Awardee: Hilary Skalski Majors/Degrees: Minor: Psychology Awards/Scholarships: Graduate Excellence in a Discipline Awardee from the BMS department, GVSU's Presidential Research Grant, and the Pew FTLC Spon- sored Teaching and Lear ning Event Grant Research: My thesis is entitled: \"Contributions of the epididymis to reduced fertility in leptin and leptin- receptor knockout mice\".
