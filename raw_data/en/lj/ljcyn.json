FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not applicable FIELD OF THE INVENTION U ie present invention relates generally to pharmaceutical compositions containing peptides having immunomodulat- 30 ing properties and more particularly to pharmaceutical com\u00ad positions of tryptophan-containing dipeptides and methods of use thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION H ie lymphoid system performs critical functions in ani\u00ad mals and man that include preventing and combating infection, and surveillance and immune elimination of tumor cells. Loss of immune function leads to an immunocompro\u00ad mised status that can predispose the host to serious and life-threatening disease. Functional abnormalities may be present in any of the elements that participate in mediating an immune response, e.g., cellular or humoral elements such as granulocytes, lymphocytes, complement, antibody, or cytokines. Immune deficiency may result from many different eti\u00ad ologies including hereditary genetic abnormalities (e.g., C h e d ia k -H ig a s h i S y n d ro m e , s e v e re c o m b in e d im m unodeficiency, chronic gran u lo m ato u s d isease, 50 DiGeorge syndrome) exposure to radiation, chemotherapy, heavy metals or insecticides; or, acquired as a result of bacterial, viral, parasitic or fungal infection. H ie immune system is normally regulated by cellular and soluble elements and loss of regulatory control may result in 55 autoimmune disease, e.g., multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, and insulin-dependent type I diabetes. Conven\u00ad tional immunosuppressive drugs that are used to treat autoimmune diseases have generalized and non-specific 60 effects on the immune system that can predispose infection and increase the risk of malignancy. Methods to compensate for decreased innate resistance to infection following radia\u00ad tion or chemotherapy are therefore of great therapeutic value. Hiymus tissue extracts affecting proliferation and/or dif\u00ad ferentiation of T-Iymphocytes have been reported, heat-stable fraction isolated from calf thymus extracts), and others. Commonly tissue extracts exist as complex mixtures that include polypeptides, e.g., several peptides have been iso\u00ad lated from thymosin fraction 5, such as thymosin alpha, (28 amino acids, U.S. Pat. No. 4,079,127), thymosin beta 4 (44 amino acids, Low, et al, Proc. N a t'l Acad. Sci. USA 78:1162-1166 (1981)), thymosin beta 8 (39 amino acids, U.S. Pat. No. 4,389,343) and thymosin beta 9 (41 amino acids, U.S. Pat. No. 4,389,343). Thymosin-U 1 fragments and dimers have also been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,396,605; 4,470,926; 4,612,365; and 4,910,296. Widespread use of purified tissue extract fractions in medical practice has been hindered by variability of preparations, low yields, lack of highly purified and char\u00ad acterized reproducible sources, and problems associated with preparing complex mixtures having standardized bio\u00ad logical potency. In addition, complexity and variability of tissue extracts potentially affect stability, toxicity, and safety. Alternatively, synthesis of large biologically active polypep\u00ad tides is at present difficult and expensive particularly under manufacturing conditions required for pharamaceutical preparations. Alternatively, synthesis of large biologically active polypeptides is at present difficult and expensive, particu\u00ad larly under the manufacturing conditions required for phar\u00ad maceutical preparations. T-Iymphocytes participate in cellular and hum oral immune responses triggered by binding of foreign molecules to lymphocyte cell surface receptors. The erythrocyte rosette receptor defined by the CD2 cell functions as both an intercellular adhesion molecule and a cell surface signal 35 transduction molecule. CD2 reportedly binds PHA and is involved in PHA-mediated lymphocyte blastogenesis. Bind\u00ad ing of anti-CD2 antibodies to the CD2 receptor is also reportedly able to trigger T-Iymphocyte blastogenesis and this pathway of activation may be independent of the 40 CD3/T-cell receptor complex. T-cell CD2 binding to LFA- 3/CD58 may intercellular adhesive of T-Iymphocytes to B-Iymphocytes and thymic epithelial cells. CD2 binding to CD59 and CD48 ligands may facilitate intercellular binding to other cell types. Lymphocyte cell 45 surface CD4 and CD 8 molecules define MHC class speci\u00ad fic ity o f T -h e lp e r, T -s u p p re sso r an d c y to to x ic T-lymphocytes. (Paul, W. E. Ed. 1993. \"Fundamental Immunology, 3rd. Edition\", Raven Press, N.Y. pp.541-5.) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Methods have been discovered for treating immunocom\u00ad promised subjects to increase one or more indicia of cell mediated immunity (CMI), humoral immunity, or innate resistance to infection, by administering pharmaceutical preparations of R'-Glu-Trp-R\". The results of in vitro studies showed that L-Glu-L-Trp dipeptide increased expression of accessory molecules on the surface of thymocytes and mature T-lymphocytes as evidenced by i) increased E-rosette forming cells (E-RFC) in thymocyte cultures after incuba\u00ad tion with dipeptide; ii) increased E-RFC in cultures of thymocytes from aged animals after incubation with dipep\u00ad tide; and, iii) increased expression of OKT 4+ in cultures of human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes from patients with secondary immunodeficiency syndromes following on lymphocytes. Increased expression of CD2 and CD4 accessory molecules 5,807,830 3 on T-lymphocytes is compatible with a heighten the state of innate or induced immunity to infection, e.g., by upregulat- ing T-helper and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes to respond to lower levels of antigen. To test this hypothesis, in vivo studies were conducted in which the immunological effects 5 of L-Glu-L-Trp dipeptide were tested in experimental ani\u00ad mal models. L-Glu-L-Trp treatments mobilized and altered tissue distribution of lymphocytes in experimental animals, activated monocytes and increased phagocytic activity of granulocytes. Animal model studies in mice showed that 10 treatments with L-Glu-L-Trp decreased incidence of mor\u00ad tality from acute bacterial infection with E. coli, Pseudomo\u00ad nas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. In irradiated guinea pigs and (5-FU) mice, L-Glu- L-Trp treatments increased the number of lymphocytes and 15 T-lymphocytes in peripheral blood. When injected locally, L-Glu-L-Trp increased the activation state of resident tissue macrophages (as measured by NBT reduction); and, pro\u00ad moted neutrophil infiltration into the tissue in response to a sterile inflammatory mediator (proteose peptone). L-Glu-L- 20 Trp treatments increased in vitro expression of CD4 (but not CD 8) on lymphocytes isolated from patients with secondary immunodeficiency syndromes. Clinical studies showed increased indicia of CMI, humoral immunity or innate immunity in the following patients treated with L-Glu-L-Trp 25 pharmaceutical preparations: namely, patients with acute and chronic infections including respiratory infections, pleuritis, pelvic inflammatory diseases, infections of leprosy, tuberculosis, staphylococcal pyoderm a, Dengue fever, chronic viral hepatitis, Shigella dysentery, m alaria, influenza, and tuberculosis. L-Glu-L-Trp treatments also i) alleviated certain clinical symptoms in patients with autoim\u00ad mune disease and allergy; ii) decreased complication rates and increased lymphocyte counts in cancer patients follow\u00ad ing radiation therapy; iii) increased lymphocyte counts in 35 individuals exposed to accidental environmental radiation and surgical thymectomy; and, iii) increased lymphocyte counts in patients with secondary immunodeficiency. L-Glu- L-Trp showed efficacy in both prophylactic and therapeutic protocols. L-Glu-L-Trp treatments also proved useful for 40 alleviating certain symptoms of systemic toxicity in patients with acute bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections. HIV-infected patients are one group of immunocompro\u00ad mised subjects that may benefit from treatments with R'-Glu-Trp-R\", however, it is understood that such treat- 45 ments are not intended as a cure for AIDS or ARC, but rather for possible use in treating complications of HIV-infection, e.g., opportunistic bacterial and viral infections. Embodiments of the invention provide methods of treat\u00ad ment using R'-Glu-Trp-R\" pharmaceutical preparations to 50 induce a heightened state of cell mediated immunity, humoral immunity, or innate resistance to infection.

No. 5,070,076 as a mixture of polypeptides 80-90% of which have molecular to sizes in the range of 600 to 6000 daltons and isoelectric points in the range of 3.5-6.7. The total mixture of polypep\u00ad tides reportedly had a composition (molar percentage) as follows: Asp (5.8), Thr (5.7), Ser (5.7), Glu (6.2), Pro (10.1), Gly (8.6), Ala (10.7), Cys (3.4), Val (8.8), Met (trace), He 15 (3.9), Leu (6.7), Tyr (2.4), Phe (3.2), His (2.9), and Lys (7.0). Isolation and purification of the polypeptides led to eventual identification of several biologically active peptides includ\u00ad ing one peptide having a Glu-Trp sequence. Synthetic L-Glu-L-Trp peptides were discovered to exhibit biological activities in vitro and in certain in vivo systems. The Pharmacologic Committee of the U.S.S.R approved thera\u00ad peutic use of L-Glu-L-Trp synthetic peptides on Jun. 19, 1990. In considering possible prior \"use\" and \"art\" issues it is valuable to consider the following noteworthy dates in opening-up of the former Soviet Socialist Republics: namely, Boris Yeltsin was elected President of the Russian Republic in June of 1991; on Aug. 24, 1991 Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party and dissolved the Central Committee; and the last meeting of the 30 Congress of Peoples Deputies took place in September of 1991 (David Remnick, \"Lenins Tomb\", Vintage Books, Random House, Inc., N.Y. 1994). U ie results of studies disclosed in the Examples below show that L-Glu-L-Trp upregulates CD2 expression on T-lymphocytes in vitro and in vivo. Other studies show immunological effects of L-Glu-L-Trp phagocytes, neutrophils, and immunologic mediator pathways underlying expression of inflammation, allergy, endotoxic shock and cellular and humoral immunity. As used herein the symbols for amino acids are according to the IUPAC-IUB recommendations published in Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 115:1-12 (1966) with the following single letter symbols for the amino acids:6 leukocyte; LN for intraperi- im for intramuscular; sc for id iv for intravenous; po for peros, i.e., oral; and, in for intranasal.

W hen her (or his) defect specifically involves elements of the immune response, they are termed herein \"immunocom\u00ad promised hosts\" or \"immunocompromised subjects.\" A sub\u00ad ject an immune defect and without a known defi\u00ad ciency in any defense mechanism is referred to herein as \"a normal terms \"modulator\" and \"modulating\" mean the agent and process of altering a normal or com- 15 promised subject's resistance to infection, e.g., by increasing the flow of mucus, promoting wound healing of epithelial barriers and the like. As used herein the terms \"im munom odulator\" and \"immunomodulating\" mean the agent and process of alter- 20 ing a normal or immunocompromised subject's immune system, as evidenced by a change in one or more laboratory measurem ents from a pre-treatm ent value to a post\u00ad treatment value and/or a change in the subject's ability to combat an infectious disease, and to heal tissue. Hence, 25 immunomodulation as used herein means altering one or more cellular and/or humoral immune indices (clinical or laboratory) from a baseline pretreatment value to a different value. In one embodiment immunomodulation results in stimulation of cellular and/or humoral immunity in an immunodeficient subject, e.g., a subject exposed to acciden\u00ad tal radiation, or treated w ith chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or thymectomy. In another embodiment immuno\u00ad modulation results in depression of cellular and/or humoral immunity in a subject with a regulatory abnormality in the 35 immune system, e.g., a subject with an autoimmune disease. The present invention encompasses both therapeutic meth\u00ad ods of treating the immunodeficient, immunodepressed, or autoimmune states per se, as well as prophylactic therapies designed to stimulate cellular and/or humoral immunity to infectious agents and disease, as well as a treatment of infections, diseases or wounds, indirectly by enhancing the immune system. This includes enhancing or restoring the subject's immune system, as evidenced by measurable blood parameters and/or the patient's improved ability to combat infection or disease, and the ability to heal tissue. The infections may be caused by a variety of microbes, e.g., viruses, bacteria, mycobacteria, fungus, parasites and the like. Hence, immunomodulation encompasses improvement of the immune system due to an immunodeficient state (e.g., caused by removal of the thymus, exposure to radiation, or acquired during infection with a microbe). Furthermore, the present invention provides methods for modulating the immune system by lowering blood parameters and other indicia of an autoimmune state if these indicia are abnor- 55 mally elevated. The present invention encompasses both prophylactic and therapeutic regimens. \"Subject in need thereof\" is intended to mean a mammal having one or more clinical or laboratory indicia of a disease.

The subject methods include delivering the prepa\u00ad ration to a patient i) before the disease has been diagnosed, e.g., prophylactic protocols delivered with the aim of pre\u00ad venting development of the disease, as well as, ii) after the disease has been diagnosed, e.g., therapeutic protocols. That the subject treatments have fulfilled the intended aim of to treating or preventing the microbial infection in the subject will be evident by a change (increase or decrease) or complete elimination of one or more clinical or laboratory indicia of disease as set forth above. Representative illness, diseases, and conditions have been classified and codified (\"International Classification of Diseases; ICD-9-CM \", Washington, D.C., 1989).

In the Examples section, an R'-Glu- Trp-R\" pharmaceutical preparation was administered in clinical tests according to the methods of the invention in an amount and for a time sufficient to: (i) increase the percent- 55 age of blast transformed lymphocytes after addition of PHA or Con-Amitogen by about 1.1-fold to about 1.9-fold (e.g., see EXAMPLES 3, 6, and 18); (ii) increase the phagocytic index of mononuclear phagocytes by about 1.1-fold to about 1.8-fold (e.g., see EXAMPLES 3 and 6); (iii) increase NK activity on YAC-target cells by about 1.1-fold to about 1.5-fold (e.g., see EXAMPLES I and 6); (iv) decrease endogenous cytokine production in an assay for leukocyte migration inhibition factor (LMIR) by about 40% to about 75% (e.g., see EXAMPLES 3, 9 and 16); and, (v) increase 65 a delayed type hypersensitivity skin test diameter by about 1.1-fold to about 3.3-fold (e.g., see EXAMPLES 3 and 18).16 \"Indicia of humoral immunity\" is used herein to mean one or more measures of a number or percentage of lymphocytes or plasma cells, and/or one or more immunoglobulin levels in a sample of peripheral blood from a subject treated according to the methods of the invention. In the latter case, the number or percentage of B-lymphocytes, plasma the like may be determined; and/or, the levels of IgA, IgD, IgG, IgM or IgE. \"Indicia of innate resistance to infection\" is used herein to mean one or more measures of a number or percentage of immune cells or their biosynthetic products in a sample of tissue or blood in a tissue or blood sample of a subject treated according to the methods of the invention. In the latter case, \"immune cells\" include (but are not limited M like; and, \"biosynthetic products of immune cells\" include (but are not limited to) immunoglobulins (e.g., IgA, IgD, IgE, IgM, IgG and C3a, C5a, Factor Bb and fibrin degradation products, vWF, tissue factor, thrombospondin, platelet factor 4, and the like), fibrinolytic proteins (e.g., plasminogen, tissue plasminogen activator, and the inhibitors (e.g., III, a 2-macroglobulin, C3b-inactivator and the like), arachidonic acid metabolites (e.g., prostaglandins, and the like), bradykinin system proteins, and receptors (e.g., soluble CD 4, IL-I receptor, IL-2 receptor and the like). Methods of Treatment Embodiments of the invention provide methods useful for treating a subject to induce a heightened state of anti\u00ad microbial cellular or humoral immunity by administering a pharmaceutical preparation of R'-Glu-Trp-R\". Pharmaceuti\u00ad cal preparations containing both R'-Glu-Trp-R\" and a second agent are also envisaged, including a variety of different 40 mixtures. The \"subject in need of\" the treatments of the invention are preferably man and domestic animals having one or more microbial infections that include, but are not limited to, subjects infected with the following infectious agents: bacteria, viruses, mycobacteria, parasites, opportu\u00ad n is tic b a c te ria or v iru s e s (e .g ., p n e u m o c y s tis, cytomegalovirus, herpes virus, mycoplasma, and the like). Representative examples of \"subjects in need thereof\" include the following: (i) individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus and having a secondary opportu\u00ad nistic infection; (ii) individuals exposed to radiation and/or one or more chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., cancer patients); (iii) individuals undergoing im m unosuppressive drug therapy (e.g., following transplantation or for treatment of an autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, sys\u00ad temic lupus erythematosus, type I syndrome, and the like); (iv) indi\u00ad viduals having a primary or secondary immune deficiency disease; (v) individuals having a staphylococcal infection (e.g., pyoderm a, furunculitis cellulitis, eczem a, acne vulgaris) with gingivitis, dental caries, or infralymphatic infection; (viii) individuals with acute or chronic respiratory disease and/or upper airways disease (e.g., sinusitis or perisinusitis, rhinovirus or influ\u00ad enza infection, bronchitis, pharyngitis, and the like), (ix) lower airways disease (e.g., pneumonia or pleuritis); (x) individuals with acute or chronic eye, nose or throat infec- 5,807,830 17 tions (e.g., bronchial allergy and/or asthma; (xii) patients having a chronic liver infection (e.g., hepatitis); and, (xiii) individuals at an increased relative risk of developing an infection or an autoimmune disease (e.g., relatives of a 5 Type I IDDM patient). \"Immune deviation\" is used herein to mean that the treatment method of the invention may be effective to change the effector elements involved in an ongoing immune response but the term as used herein does not mean 10 effecting a quantitative increase or decrease in an ongoing immune response. Representative examples of immune deviation include affecting in the subject so treated (i) a change from an ongoing humoral immune response to a cell-mediated immune response, (ii) a change from an 15 IgE-mediated immune response to an IgG-mediated immune response; (iii) a change from a first microbial antigen to a second microbial antigen; (iv) a change from a cytotoxic lymphocyte response to a macrophage mediated immune response; and, (v) a change from an autoimmune cytotoxic lymphocyte response to production of an IgG that blocks cytotoxic killing of tissue cells. The treatment methods of the invention may effect immune deviation in a treated subject. Immune deviation in the treated subject may be determined by evaluating cell mediated and humoral 25 immunity, prior to and after treatment. As disclosed above, the \"subject in need thereof\" may be an immunocompromised subject such an individual have an underlying im m unodeficiency syndrom e occasioning frequent, recurrent, or intermittent microbial infections. 30 Underlying patient syndromes include (but are not limited to) hereditary and acquired immunodeficiency syndromes such as prim ary im m unodeficiency syndrom es (e.g., DiGeorge Syndrome, X-Iinked Iym- phoproliferative disease); syndromes resulting diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome); syndromes resulting from an underlying infection (e.g., HIV infection); syndromes resulting from a toxic reaction to a drug or a 40 chemical; or secondary immunodeficiency disorders such as those disclosed in EXAMPLES 2-3, 12-13, 24, and 28. The subject treatment methods of the invention preferably stimulate increased cellular, humoral or innate immunity, and thereby ameliorate or eliminate one or more \"clinical or laboratory indicia of disease,\" e.g., redness and swelling, fever, malaise, septicemia, pyogenic exudates, and the like. The subject treatment methods of the invention may also restore one or more measurements of a \"laboratory indicia of disease,\" i.e., changing a measurement value from an abnor\u00ad mal value to a more normal value; or alternatively, the subject treatments may increase a laboratory value above the normal range, i.e., to achieve an increased anti-microbial immunity. Representative examples of changes in a labora\u00ad tory indicia of disease include (but are not limited to) the following: (i) decreasing an elevated neutrophil or lympho\u00ad cyte count in a sample of peripheral blood into the normal range of values; (ii) increasing an abnormally low hemat\u00ad ocrit; (iii) decreasing an elevated serum alpha globulin level in a serum sam ple (e.g., an acute phase reactant 60 measurement); (iv) decreasing an elevated IgM immunoglo\u00ad bulin level or changing an IgG1ZIgG2 ratio in a serum sample; (v) increasing abnormally low expression of one or more cell surface accessory molecules in a blood sample of immune cells (e.g., CD2, CD3, CD4, CD26, CD28, CD45, B220, surface Ig, Rag I and Rag 2, Ia/Mac-1 and the like), (vi) increasing biosynthesis of one or more interleukins18 (e.g., IL-2, IL-1, TNF, TGF-, IFN-, and the like) in a sample of immune cells isolated from the subject; (vi) increasing biosynthesis of antibody specific for the subject microbe (e.g., using a diagnostic immunoassay format) in a serum sample; (vii) increasing phagocytic activity in an in vitro assay with mononuclear phagocytes or neutrophils from a sample of blood; (viii) decreasing an abnormally enlarged spleen or increasing a small spleen to more effec\u00ad tively combat infection (e.g., as determined by CAT scan or sonography); (ix) increasing the proportion of Fc-receptor- bearing lymphoid cells in spleen, thymus, and/or bone marrow sample; (x) increasing Fc-receptor-bearing lym\u00ad phoid cells in a sample of peripheral increasing T-lymphocytes in a spleen biopsy specimen; (xii) increasing the number of neutrophils in a measured volume of a tissue infiltrate in response to an inflammatory agent; and/or (xiii) increasing the percentage of phagocytically active cells in a neutrophil infiltrate sample from the subject. Utility of Treatment The subject methods of the invention find a variety of 20 prophylactic and therapeutic uses in treatment of immune pathophysiologic conditions in man and domestic animals. In certain embodiments the methods of the invention find use during in vitro maintenance and expansion of bone marrow, peripheral blood leukocytes, CD34+ lymphocytes, and other immune cells, such as may occur prior to autolo\u00ad gous or allogenic bone marrow transplantation. In one preferred embodiment, an R'-Glu-Trp-R\" pharma\u00ad ceutical preparation is administered to an individual with a diagnosed autoimmune disease in an amount and for a time sufficient to decrease one or more laboratory indicia of the disease state in the patient. Representative examples of the laboratory indicia include the following: (i) levels of IgG and/or IgM rheumatoid factor in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA); (ii) levels of anti-red cell antibodies in 35 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); (iii) levels of complement activation fragments (e.g., C3a, C5a, C3b, SC5b-9, Bb and the like) in patients with IDDM, RA or SLE; (iv) levels of fibrin degradation fragments in patients with juvenile-onset RA; (v) levels of spontaneous lymphocyte blastogenesis in vitro (e.g., 3H-thymidine incorporation). Illustrative uses of the subject treatment methods in several different patient populations resulted in: (i) a decrease of about 1.1-fold to about 1.7-fold in peripheral 45 blood polym orphonuclear leukocyte counts from an elevated pretreatment value to a lower post-treatment value in patients with chronic staphylococcal infections and acute osteomyelitis (e.g., see EXAMPLES 6 and 16); (ii) a decrease of about 1.1-fold to about 1.3-fold in peripheral 50 blood mononuclear phagocyte counts from an elevated pretreatment value to a lower post-treatment value in patients with chronic staphylococcal infections (e.g., see EXAMPLE 6); (iii) a decrease of about 1.1-fold to about 1.9-fold in B-lymphocytes from an elevated pretreatment 55 value to a lower post-treatment value in patients with chronic staphylococcal or hepatitis infection (e.g., see EXAMPLES 6 and 23); and, (iv) a decrease of about 1.1-fold to about 1.3-fold in CD 4+-lymphocytes in periph\u00ad eral blood from an elevated pretreatment value to a lower post-treatm ent value in patients w ith SLE (e.g., see EXAMPLE 6). In another preferred embodiment, an R'-Glu-Trp-R\" phar\u00ad maceutical preparation is administered to an individual exhibiting systemic toxicity, (e.g., febrile, jaundiced, alter- 65 nating chills and fever), in an amount and for a time sufficient to decrease one or more laboratory indicia of the disease state in the patient. Representative examples of the 5,807,830 19 laboratory indicia include measurements ferred embodiment a treatment regimen according to the method of the invention consists of administering to the subject in need thereof a dose of about 10 % per I kilogram of body weight to about I mg per I kg body weight once daily an each of about I day to about 30 days. In most preferred embodiments the subject dose is administered either as a single daily intramuscular dose, or as a single daily intranasal dose, of an R'-Glu-Trp-R\" pharmaceutical preparation. In the latter case the subject dosage form is preferably either a sterile injectable solution, or inhalant, nose drop or mucosal spray solution containing about 0.001% weight to about 0.01% of the R'-Glu-Trp-R\" phar\u00ad maceutical preparation. Alternatively, the formulation of the R'-Glu-Trp-R\" pharmaceutical preparation may be in a unit dose delivery form, e.g., a tablet, capsule, suppository, eye film, paste or ointment. A most preferred unit dose form delivers about 0.01 mg of the R'-Glu-Trp-R\" pharmaceutical preparation. It is an object of the present invention to provide methods and R'-Glu-Trp-R\" pharmaceutical compositions, (of which the dipeptide L-Glu-L-Trp, its analogs and derivatives, mul- 25 timers and cyclized forms are representative examples), that have immunomodulatory activity for medical and veterinary uses, e.g., treatment of infections, diseases, wounds, burns, frost bites, and the like. It is also an object of the present invention to provide therapeutic methods for treatment of 30 immunodepressed and immunodeficient states. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide methods for preventing and treating infections in a subject including opportunistic infection in an immunodeficient or immun\u00ad odepressed subject. Treatment for Immune Disorders In a representative prophylactic treatment regimen, the subject compositions of the invention are administered to a patient susceptible to, or otherwise at risk, for infection, anemia, or immune regulatory disorder that may be ame\u00ad nable to treatment by the subject methods of the invention in an amount defined as a \"prophylactically effective dose.\" \"Prophylactically effective dose\" is used herein to mean an amount sufficient to protect the subject against development of a disease, wherein the amount will depend on the patient's 45 state of health and weight, but will generally fall within the ranges described herein for therapeutic use. Prophylactic administration may be particularly desirable for hosts that have been exposed or at risk for exposure of infectious diseases, e.g., health-care workers, travelers, family mem\u00ad bers of infected individuals, immunosuppressed persons, and the like. The compositions of the present invention can be used for prophylaxis against agents of common illnesses such as rhinoviruses, orthomyxoviruses, adenoviruses, a-hemolytic Streptococcus, a-Staphylococcus, and the like. The compositions of the present invention can be adminis\u00ad tered for surgical prophylaxis to lessen the risk of infectious complications. The compositions can also be used to inhibit organ rejection. Such organs can include skin, heart, lung, kidney, bone, liver, pancreas, tendon, and the like. The present compositions are particularly useful when used prophylactically to inhibit rejection of skin grafts. In a representative therapeutic treatment regimen, a phar\u00ad maceutical preparation of the present invention is adminis\u00ad tered alone, or optionally with a second pharmaceutical agent, i.e., the latter two agent therapy is termed herein \"combined therapy\". In a combined therapy the subject20 R'-Glu-Trp-R\" composition is preferably administered with one or more antibiotics, anti-viral compounds, or anti-fungal compounds, anti-parasitic agents, anti-inflammatory agent, or chemotherapeutic compounds. The subject compositions 5 may be administered either in conjunction with the second treatment modalities, or separately, e.g., at different times or in different syringes or tablets. Often, the dose of the additional agents may be less than standard dosages (i.e., because of the immunostimulatory effects of the subject to compositions. Often, R'-Glu-Trp-R\" is administered in a combined therapy with an anti-infective agent such as one or more antibiotics (i.e., anti-inflammatory agents, vaccines, antihistam ines, im m unom odulators, chem otherapeutic agents and the like.

Representative uses of the subject methods of the inven\u00ad tion in treating an immunocompromised subject include treatments designed to ameliorate clinical symptoms result- 25 ing from administration of chemotherapeutic compounds, e.g., during treatment of malignancy, graft-versus-host disease, autoimmune states, and the like. Autoimmune states in which treatment the methods of the present invention may prove useful include diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, 30 systemic connective tissue disorder, multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and the like (see Frank, et al., eds, SAMPTER'S IMMUNOLOGICAL DISEASES, Little, 35 Brown, N.Y. 1994). The immunomodulating properties of the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention provide a means for ameliorating, i.e., making better/making normal, one or more symptoms of disease in a subject. Treatment of Infectious Diseases A variety of disease states may be treated by the subject methods of the invention. Infectious diseases may be treated. The infections may be bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic. The methods may be practiced in immunocompromised or immunocompetent hosts. Illustrative uses of the methods of 45 the invention in treating patients with bacterial diseases are disclosed in the Examples section as follows: in treating patients with staphylococcal skin diseases (EXAMPLE 6); in treating patients with pelvic inflammatory diseases including com plications o f pregnancy, post-partem infections, and uterine infections (EXAMPLE 7); in treating patients with gastrointestinal diseases including Shigella dysentery (EXAMPLE 23); and, opportunistic infections (EXAMPLE 13). Localized or disseminated infections may be treated by the present methods. The infections may be in any organ, tissue or body cavity, e.g., lungs, bone, kidney, central nervous system, heart, skin and soft tissues (e.g., post- traumatic infections), reproductive organs (orchitis, pelvic inflammatory diseases, and the like), liver, and the like. 60 Illustrative uses of the subject methods in treatment of localized and disseminated infections are disclosed in the Examples section as follows: nose, ear and throat infections, sinusitis, pleuritis, pneumonia, and ophthalmic infections (EXAMPLES 4 and 11).

Representa\u00ad tive pharmaceuticals that may be administered in conjunc\u00ad tion with the subject dipeptide compositions in the methods of the invention include (but are not limited to) anti-infective agents such as: penicillin id in es, ph en azo p y rid in n d ecy le n ic im pip- ero n y b u to x id e , su lfu r, iso n ia z id , p y razin am id e, ethambutol, capreomycin sulfate, cycloserine, ethambutol h in e h y d ro ch lo rid e , fu ra z o n Ampligen, c a sta n o sp e rm in e , so lu b le C D 4, d e x tra n s u lfa te , d i d e o x y c y t i d i n e , d i d e o x y i n o s i n e , didihydrodideoxythymidine, foscarnet the like. uses of the subject methods of the inven\u00ad tion in a combined regimen for treating a mycobacterial 20 infection includes administering the subject R'-Glu-Trp-R\" composition and at least one anti-infective agent to a subject in need thereof. The mycobacterial infection may be local\u00ad ized or generalized, e.g., pulmonary and disseminated lesions of Mycobacterium leprae (e.g., as disclosed in 25 EXAMPLE 18, below) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis (e.g., as disclosed in EXAMPLE 21, below). The subject methods may prove particularly useful in treating mycobacterial infection which are resistant to antibiotics. The anti- infective agent will generally be administered according to 30 its standard dosage schedule. For example, treatment of M ycobacterium tuberculosis infections may comprise administering the dipeptides (or corresponding polymeric or cyclic forms) to the host in conjunction with standard therapy, such as iso n iazid , rifam p in , eth am b u to l, 35 streptomycin, or pyrazinamide. These agents will generally be administered according to treatment protocols of the World Health Organization (Geneva, Switzerland) or Cen\u00ad ters for Disease Control (Atlanta, Ga.). Treatment o f M yco\u00ad bacterium leprae infections may include administration of a 40 composition of the present invention, as well as dapsone, rifampin, clofazimine, or ethionamide according to standard protocols as suggested by the World Health Organization (Geneva, Switzerland) or National Hansen's Disease Center (Carville, La.). Representative uses of the subject methods in treating subjects with mycotic infections include treatments for patients having candidiasis (systemic or mucocutaneous), asp erg illo sis, b lasto m y co sis, chro m o b lasto m y co sis, c o c c id io -m y co sis, cry p to c o cc o sis, h isto p la sm o sis, m u c o r m y c o s i s , p a r a c o c c i d i o d o m y c o s i s , pseudallescheriasis, or sporotichosis. The subject treatments for mycotic infections include combined therapeutic regi\u00ad mens in which the subject composition is administered with an anti-fungal agent, e.g., amphotericin B, flucytosine, ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, and the like, to a subject in need thereof Representative uses of the subject methods of the inven\u00ad tion in treatment of viral infections include treatment of s u b je c ts h a v in g in fe c tio n s w ith H IV -1, H IV -2, cytomegalovirus, herpes viruses, HTLV-I, virus, hepa\u00ad titis viruses, influenza virus, and Dengue virus.

Representative uses of the subject methods for treating subjects with parasitic infections includes patients having leish m an iasis, pn eu m o cy stis in The subject treatment methods with R'-Glu-Trp-R\" are exemplified by methods disclosed below in which L-Glu-L-Trp compositions were adminis\u00ad tered in a combined treatment regimen with an anti-parasitic agent, e.g., with a quinine derivative in a patient with malaria (as illustrated in EXAMPLE 19). Treatment Methods Illustrative uses of the subject methods of the invention in treating clinical symptoms of immunodeficiency diseases, and symptoms of various bacterial, viral, or inflammatory diseases states are illustrated in the Examples section. The dose, route, and duration of administration of the R'-Glu- Trp-R\" compositions can be determined by a skilled prac\u00ad titioner according to recognized and accepted methods of clinical practice, such as monitoring patient response to therapy (i.e., clinical indicia of disease) and/or laboratory test results (i.e., laboratory indicia of disease). In addition, methods for administration of R'-Glu-Trp-R\" are disclosed in greater detail in the EXAMPLES section. It is routine in the practice of medicine for a physician to examine and treat patients w ith various infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases, or immunodeficiency diseases. Examples of infec\u00ad tious diseases include inner ear infections, sinus infections, urinary tract infections, pneumonia, bacterial endocarditis, osteomyelitis and the like. Examples of autoimmune dis\u00ad eases include systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes, myasthenia gravis, Sjogren's syndrome, and the like. Examples of immunodeficiency diseases leading to immunocompro- 45 mised hosts include primary and secondary immunodefi\u00ad ciency syndromes such as Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome and HIV-infection. Some syndromes are less severe than others. For example bacterial endocarditis can be life threatening, whereas inner ear infections are rarely life threatening. In 50 deciding whether to use the subject methods of the invention in combination therapy, e.g., with antibiotics or other bio\u00ad logically active agents (e.g., interferons or interleukins) to treat the particular syndrome, a physician will usually base the decision on knowledge of w hether opportunistic 55 bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections are commonly involved in subject syndrome. Such knowledge has been accumulated over decades, and is reported in the medical literature as well as medical texts. The timing of when to start the subject methods in combination or single agent 60 therapy rests on the physician's clinical judgement. For life threatening infections, the physician will usually obtain the specimens for culture (e.g., for a throat or blood culture) and begin treatment with what has become standard empiric antibiotic therapy. Empiric therapy is a therapy designed to 65 treat the most common or likely causative agent based on historic, demographic, and epidemiologic information. Empiric therapy may often include use of multiple thera- 5,807,830 25 peutic agents (e.g., more than one antibiotic and/or broad spectrum antibiotics) designed to cover a wide range of therapeutic possibilities. W hen laboratory test data are avail\u00ad able (commonly about 48 hours for bacteriology or immu\u00ad nology tests and 3 to 7 days for virology tests) the choice of 5 therapy may be adjusted to more particularly treat the disease (e.g., based on the results of ill vitro antibiotic sensitivity testing ). Because treatment of clinical syndromes is very often initiated empirically (before the causative agent or underlying condition has been identified), it would be to very difficult if not impossible to test clinically a new therapeutic agent or method for one particular bacteria (e.g., staphylococcus). Rather, a new therapeutic method must be tested for a particular clinical syndrome. It is important to note that, for any given infectious syndrome, several differ- 15 ent infectious agents or underlying conditions may be poten\u00ad tial causative agents of the disease. In the art of pharma\u00ad ceutical drug development, preclinical studies of a therapy evaluate the therapy's effects on not just one infectious agent or condition, but on multiple agents or conditions of interest. The results of the various (sometimes equivocal) studies are weighed as to the benefits and risks of the particular therapy given the medical knowledge of the risks associated with a particular disease. It is common that not all patients with a syndrome are cured by a single therapy, but instead, that a subset of patients may exist wherein the therapy has a positive and favorable result. Examples of clinical syn\u00ad dromes in which subsets of patients may find favorable outcomes from the subject therapies of the invention are disclosed in the following several paragraphs. Representative uses of the subject methods for treating an immunocompromised subject may alleviate symptoms such as susceptibility to one or more opportunistic bacterial or viral infections including those caused by Pneumocystis, cytomegalovirus, herpes virus, Staphylococcus, and the like. In one embodiment, a patient is administered an amount of R'-Glu-Trp-R\" sufficient to induce an increase in either the total ber of lym examples of immunocompromised patients who may benefit 40 from the subject treatment methods are provided in the Examples section including: i) patients with cancer follow\u00ad ing radiation therapy, i.e., breast cancer patients and patients with thoracic cavity tumors and other cancers after radiation therapy (EXAMPLE 3, Protocols A -C ); ii) patients having 45 occupational radiation exposure (EXAMPLE 12, Protocols A and B); and, iii) patients following adult thymectomy (EXAMPLE 24). Illustrative examples of other immuno\u00ad compromised patients who may benefit from the subject treatment methods include patients having one or more temporary immune defects resulting from i) chronic bacte\u00ad rial infections w ith M. leprae or M. tuberculosis (EXAMPLES 18 and 21, respectively); ii) chronic hepatitis B virus infections (EXAMPLE 25, Protocol B); patients having pyelonephritis and prostatitis (EXAMPLE 17); 55 osteomyelitis (EXAMPLE 16); and psoriasis (EXAMPLE 6).

Representative uses of the subject methods for treating a subject also include treatments of patients with dental caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. Illustrative uses of the subject methods in treatment of patients with gingivitis and peri- 25 apical granulomas is disclosed in EXAMPLE 9 (Protocols A and C). The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are in te n d e d fo r p a re n te ra l, to p ic a l, su b c u ta n e o u s, intramuscular, intrathecal, oral, intranasal, or local admin- 30 istration for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatment. Preferably, the compositions of the present invention are administered intramuscularly or intranasally. The subject R'-Glu-Trp-R\" compositions herein have the advantage of providing the desired effects at very low dosage levels and 35 without toxicity. Thus, a purpose of therapy in an acute setting may be to rapidly increase the concentration of R'-Glu-Trp-R\" in a tissue, e.g., by bolus intravenous injec\u00ad tion or infusion. Alternatively, in other cases it may desirable to deliver R'-Glu-Trp-R\" over a longer period of time. Pharmaceutical Compositions The subject compositions containing R'-Glu-Trp-R\" may be formulated in a manner that allows absorption into the blood stream. The present compositions are immunomodu\u00ad lators that induce changes at the cellular level that subse\u00ad quently effect changes in cellular processes that no longer are dependent on the presence of the composition. So, in many instances it has been observed that the effects of the peptide are long-lasting, i.e., for weeks to months, despite the rather rapid degradation of the peptide, e.g., within 50 minutes or hours. Although the subject R'-Glu-Trp-R\" com\u00ad pounds are themselves water-soluble at the low concentra\u00ad tions in which they are usually employed, they are prefer\u00ad ably used in the form of their acid or alkaline salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable agents, e.g., acetic, citric, maleic, succinic acid, sodium, potassium, ammonium, or zinc (as disclosed in greater detail below). Freely-soluble salts of the subject R'-Glu-Trp-R\" compositions may also be converted to salts of low solubility in body fluids, e.g., by modification with a slightly water-soluble pharmaceutically 60 acceptable salt like tannic or palmoic acid, or by inclusion in a time-release formulation with covalently coupling to a larger carrier, or inclusion in timed-release capsule and the like. The active dipeptide ingredient of the pharmaceutical preparations according to the present invention may be used as a free peptide or in the form of a water soluble pharma\u00ad ceutically acceptable salt, such as a sodium, potassium, 5,807,830 27 ammonium or zinc salt. It will be understood that the dipeptide may be administered with other active ingredients which independently impart an activity to the composition, such as, antibiotics, interferon, anesthetics, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be conveniently pre- 5 pared from EW dipeptide or analogs by conventional meth\u00ad ods. Thus, such salts may be, for example, prepared by treating EW dipeptide with an aqueous solution of the desired pharmaceutically acceptable metallic hydroxide or other metallic base and evaporating the resulting solution to to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure in a nitrogen atmosphere. Alternatively, a solution of EW dipeptide may be mixed with an alkoxide to the desired metal, and the solution subsequently evaporated to dryness. The pharma\u00ad ceutically acceptable hydroxides, bases, and alkoxides 15 include those with cations for this purpose, including (but not limited to), potassium, sodium, ammonium, calcium, and magnesium. Other representative pharmaceutically acceptable salts administration, the present invention pro\u00ad vides pharmaceutical preparations which comprise a tryptophan-containing dipeptide, polym eric, multimeric, cyclic or derivative form thereof, dissolved in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, preferably an aqueous carrier. A variety of aqueous carriers may be used, e.g., water, buffered water, 0.4% saline, 0.3% glycine, and the like, including proteins and/or glycoproteins for enhanced stability, such as albumin, lipoprotein, globulin, and the like. These compositions may be sterilized by conventional, well known sterilization techniques. The resulting aqueous solu\u00ad tions may be packaged for use or filtered under aseptic conditions and lyophilized, the lyophilized preparation 35 being combined with a sterile aqueous solution prior to administration. The compositions may contain pharmaceu\u00ad tically acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pEl adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents and the like, 40 for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, etc. It may be desirable to stabilize EW dipeptides, analogs, receptor fragments, and the like to increase their shelf life and pharmacokinetic half-life. Shelf life stability is improved by 45 adding excipients such as: a) hydrophobic agents bacteriostatic agents. Pharmacokinetic half-lifes of peptides are modified by coupling to carrier peptides, 50 polypeptides, and carbohydrates by chemical derivatization (e.g., by coupling side chain or N- or C-terminal residues), or chemically altering the amino acid to another amino acid (as above). Pharmacokinetic half-lifes and pharmacodynam\u00ad ics may also be modified by: a) encapsulation (e.g., in 55 liposomes); b) controlling the degree of hydration (e.g., by controlling the extent and type of glycosylation of the peptide); and, c) controlling the electrostatic charge and hydrophobicity of the peptide. A presently most preferred formulation according to the instant invention is a solution for intramuscular injection containing about 0.001 to 0.01% by weight (0.0001-0.001 mg/kg body weight, or 10-100 % active ingredient per I mL solvent). The pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle for this preferred injection form may be any pharmaceutically 65 acceptable solvent such as 0.9% aqueous sodium chloride, distilled water, Novocaine solution, Ringer's solution, cose solution, and the like. The dipeptide containing com\u00ad positions according to the present invention may be admin\u00ad istered with a compatible pharmaceutical suitable for parenteral administration (e.g., intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular). The preparations may be subjected to c o n v e n tio n a l p h a rm a c e u tic a l o p e ra tio n s, su ch as sterilizatio n , and m ay contain adjuvants, such as preservatives, stabilizers, wetting agents and the like. The peptides in the present compositions are typically biologi\u00ad cally active at a dose of about 0.5 /rg/kg to about 10 /rg/kg, preferably about I /rg/kg to about 5 /rg/kg. The concentration of the peptides in these pharmaceutical compositions can vary widely, i.e., from about 0.001% to as much as 15 or 20% by weight and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular m ode o f a d m in istra tio n se le c te d . W hen u tiliz e d intramuscularly, the injection solution has the active ingre\u00ad dient in a therapeutically effective immunopotentiating amount of about 0.001 to 0.01% by weight. If prepared in the form of a tablet, capsule or suppository, it is preferred that the active ingredient be present in an amount of about 0.1 mg per tablet, suppository or capsule. In such form, the capsule, suppository or tablet may also contain other conventional excipients and vehicles such as fillers, starch, glucose, etc. In topical preparations, the peptides are generally contained in 25 urea-based emollients, petroleum-based ointments, and the like at concentrations of about 0.1 to 10,000 parts per million, preferably about I to 1000 parts per million, and most preferably about 10 to 100 parts per million. Actual methods for preparing parenterally, orally, and topically 30 administrable compounds will be known or apparent to those skilled in the art and are described in detail in, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Science, 17th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1985), which is incorporated herein by reference. Intramuscular and intranasal routes are preferred for administration of the subject R'-Glu-Trp-R\" compositions. One preferred dosage of the subject composition for intra\u00ad muscular administration is about 50 % to 100 % per dose for adults (for a 300 % to 1000 % total treatment therapy); for infants up to I year old about 10 % per dose, for infants I to 3 years old about 10 % to 20 % per dose; for infants 4 to 6 years old about 20 % to 30 % per dose, for children 7 to 14 years old about 50 % per dose. AU of the foregoing dosages are useful for a treatment of 3 to 10 days, depending upon the immunodeficiency level. The treatment may be repeated as needed, usually within I to 6 months. In another preferred embodiment, a treatment dose of about 10 /rg/kg to about I mg/kg of a pharmaceutical preparation of R'-Glu- Trp-R\" is administered to a subject daily over a period of about 6 days to about 10 days, but optionally at the discre\u00ad tion of the attending physician, for up to about 30 days. In one preferred course of therapy, R'-Glu-Trp-R\" is adminis\u00ad tered im daily at a dosage of 1-100 /rg/kg for 5 -7 days, followed by a 1-6 month resting period before repeating the same injection regimen. The subject methods include those in which the R'-Glu- Trp-R\" are administered by injection, e.g., by parenteral, intramuscular, intradermal, subcutaneous, and intraperito- neal injection. In a most preferred embodiment, the treat- 60 ment dose is sufficient to increase a number or percentage of CD2+ or Fc-receptor-bearing lymphocytes in peripheral blood or in a reticuloendothelial tissue, or to increase a number of immune cells in an inflammatory infiltrate, or to increase a proportion of phagocytically active cells in an inflammatory infiltrate. For embodiments where the subject compositions of the invention is intended for treatment of an infectious disease 5,807,830 29 in a subject, an amount is administered that is sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the disease and its compli\u00ad cations. An amount adequate to effect this therapeutic result in more than 50% of subjects so treated is defined as a \"therapeutically effective dose.\" Amounts effective for this use will depend on the severity of the infection or disease and the weight and general state of the patient being treated, but generally range from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 5000 mg/kg host body weight of R'-Glu-Trp-R\" dipeptide per day, more commonly about 0.2 mg/kg to about 1000 mg/kg host body weight of dipeptide per day, usually about 0.5 /rg/kg to about 100 gfk.g host body per day, more usually about 0.75 /rg/kg to about 20 gfk.g host body weight per day, and preferably about I gfk.g to about 10 /rg/kg host body weight per day. Maintenance dosages over a prolonged period of 15 time may be adjusted as necessary. Typical total daily doses are about 50 to 100 % in adults, about 50 g in children 7-14 years of age, about 20-30 % in children 4 to 6 years of age, about 10-20 g in children 1-3 years of age and about 10 g in children less than one year of age. The 20 compositions may be administered once daily or more often as desired. Treatment of acute conditions generally will occur over about 3-10 days. Treatment of chronic conditions or prophylactic treatments have the same course, but can be repeated after as long as about 1-6 months or longer. In some instances, it may be desirable to administer the com\u00ad positions intermittently on a daily basis for periods of about 2 to about 20 days, preferably about 3 to about 14 days, more preferably about 4 to about 10 days which are repeated at least about 15 days, preferably about 20 days or as much as about I to 6 months or more. The route of delivery of R'-Glu-Trp-R\" dipeptides and the like is determined by the disease and the site where treat\u00ad ment is required. For topical application it may be desirable to apply the dipeptide, analogs, agonists, and antagonists at the local site ((e.g., by placing a needle into the tissue at that site) or by placing an impregnated bandage during surgery); while for more advanced diseases it may be desirable to adm inister the com positions system ically. For other indications, the R'-Glu-Trp-R\" dipeptides, analogs, agonists, antagonists, derivatives and the by intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intranasal, bronchial instillation (e.g., with a nebulizer), transdermal delivery (e.g., with a lipid-soluble carrier in a skin patch), or 45 gastrointestinal delivery (e.g., with a capsule or tablet). In general, the acid addition salts of the subject R'-Glu- Trp-R\", e.g., L-Glu-L-Lys, compositions with pharmaceuti\u00ad cally acceptable acids will be biologically equivalent to the subject compositions themselves. The preferred therapeutic compositions, inocula, routes, and dosages will vary with the clinical indication. For intramuscular injection, the inoculum is typically prepared from a dried peptide (or peptide conjugate) by suspending the peptide in a physiologically acceptable diluent such as 55 water, saline, or phosphate-buffered saline. Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending upon the con\u00ad dition of the patient being treated, and the physician will, in any event, determine the appropriate dose for the individual patient. The effective amount of peptide per unit dose depends, among other things, on the body w eight, physiology, and chosen inoculation regimen. A unit dose of peptide refers to the weight of peptide without the weight of carrier (when carrier is used). An effective treatment will be achieved w hen the concentration of R '-G lu-Trp-R \" dipeptide, e.g., L-Glu-L-Trp, at a tissue site in the microen\u00ad vironment of the cells approaches a concentration of IO-5M30 to IO-9M. Skilled practitioners can make use of clinical and laboratory indicia to monitor patient response to the subject therapy and adjust the dosage accordingly. Since the phar\u00ad macokinetics and pharmacodynamics of R'-Glu-Trp-R\" 5 dipeptides, agonists, antagonists, and the like will vary in different patients, a most preferred method for achieving a therapeutic concentration in a tissue is to gradually escalate the dosage and monitor the clinical and laboratory indicia. The initial dose, for such an escalating dosage regimen of to therapy, will depend upon the route of administration. For intravenous administration, of R'-Glu-Trp-R\" dipeptide with an approximate molecular weight of 200 to 400 daltons, an initial dosage of approximately 0.1 mg/kg body weight is administered and the dosage is escalated at 10-fold increases in concentration for each interval of the escalating dosage regimen. For prophylactic uses against opportunistic infections in immunodeficient or immunodepressed patients, the intra\u00ad muscular and/or intranasal single daily dose for adults may be from about 50 to 10 g, and for children about 10 g to 50 g per dose for treatment over 3 to 5 days. For treatment of burns, frost bite, or other wounds, including chronic apical periodontitis, the dipeptide may be applied in about 100 g doses as a paste or other suitable 25 medium. For ophthalmology, such as for treatment of infectious eye diseases, the dipeptide may be applied in single daily dosages of about 10 g (over 4 to 10 days) or as installations into the conjunctival cavity at about 5 g twice daily over 30 about 4 to 5 days. The dipeptide may be injected intramuscularly in an injection solution having a therapeutically effective immu\u00ad nomodulatory amount of about 0.001 to 0.01% by weight of the subject R'-Glu-Trp-R\" composition. If presented in the 35 form of a tablet, capsule or suppository, it is preferred that the active ingredient be present in an amount of about 0.1 mg per tablet, suppository or capsule. If presented in such form, the capsule, suppository or tablet may also contain other conventional excipients and vehicles such as fillers, starch, 40 glucose, etc. Synthesis of R'-Glu-Trp-R\" Conveniently, the subject R'-Glu-Trp-R\" dipeptide is syn\u00ad thesized by any of a number of automated techniques that are now commonly available. Generally speaking, these techniques involve stepwise synthesis by successive addi\u00ad tions of amino acids to produce progressively larger mol\u00ad ecules. The amino acids are linked together by condensation between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of another amino acid to form a peptide bond. To 50 control these reactions, it is necessary to block the amino group of one amino acid and the carboxyl group of the other. The blocking groups should be selected for easy removal without adversely affecting the peptides, i.e., by racemiza- tion or by hydrolysis of the formed peptide bonds. Amino acids with carboxyl-groups (e.g., Asp, Glu) or hydroxyl- groups (e.g., Ser, homoserine, and Tyr) also require blocking prior to condensation. A wide variety of procedures exist for synthesis of peptides, solid-phase synthesis usually being preferred. In this procedure an amino acid is bound to a resin 60 particle, and the peptide generated in a stepwise manner by successive additions of protected amino acids to the growing chain. Modifications of the technique described by Merri- field are commonly used (Merrifield, R. B., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 96:2989-2993 (1964)). In an exemplary automated 65 solid-phase method, peptides are synthesized by loading the carboxy-terminal amino acid onto an organic linker (e.g., PAM, 4-oxymethyl phenylacetamidomethyl) covalently 5,807,830 31 attached to an insoluble polystyrene resin that is cross-linked with divinyl benzene. Blocking with t-Boc is used to protect the terminal amine, and hydroxyl- and carboxyl-groups are commonly blocked with O-benzyl groups. Synthesis is accomplished in an automated peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif., e.g., Model 430-A). Follow\u00ad ing synthesis the product may be removed from the resin and blocking groups removed using hydrofluoric acid or trifluo- romethyl sulfonic acid according to established methods (Bergot, B. J. & S. N. McCurdy ,Applied Biosystems Bulletin (1987)). A routine synthesis can produce 0.5 mmole of peptide-resin. The yield following cleavage and purification is approximately 60 to 70%. For example, an amino and side chain protected derivative of an activated ester of Glx is reacted with side-group protected Trp, attached to the solid phase at its C-terminus. After elimination of the alpha-amino 15 protecting group, the peptide may be cleaved from the solid phase or another amino acid added in a similar fashion. Additional amino acids are serially added in a similar fashion. The peptides are then cleaved by acid that also typically removes protecting groups. The peptides may then 20 be isolated and lyophilized and stored for future use. Suit\u00ad able techniques of peptide synthesis are described in detail in S te w a rt & Y oung, SO L ID PH A S E P E P T ID E SYNTHESIS, 2d edition, Pierce Chemical Company, 1984; and Tam, et al.,J. Am. Chem. Soc. 105:6442 (1983), both of 25 which are incorporated herein by reference. Purification of the product peptides is accomplished, for example, by crystallizing the peptide from an organic solvent such as methyl-butyl ether, followed by dissolving in distilled water, and dialysis (if the molecular weight of the peptide is greater 30 than about 500 daltons), thin layer chromatography, gel chromatography, lyophilization, or reverse HPLC (e.g., using a C18 column with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile as solvents) if the molecular weight of the peptide less than 500 daltons. Purified peptide is lyophilized 35 is stored in a dry state until use. A representative R'-Glu- Trp-R\" pharmaceutical preparation is the purified dipeptide L-Glu-L-Trp, which comprises a white powder (if lyo\u00ad philized; otherwise, it is crystalline), soluble in an amino and side chain protected derivative of 45 an activated ester of glutamic acid is reacted with protected L-tryptophan. After elimination of the protecting groups and conventional purification, such as by thin layer or GL chromatography, the peptide may be purified such as by, lyophilization, gel purification, and the like. Pharmaceutically Acceptable Carriers The compounds may be administered alone or formulated with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, in either single or multiple doses. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous solutions, and 55 various nontoxic organic solvents. Pharmaceutical compo\u00ad sitions can be formed by combining R'-Glu-Trp-R\" dipep\u00ad tide with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and an optional antibiotic. The subject combination therapeutic agents can then readily be administered in a variety of dosage forms such as tablets, lozenges, syrups, injectable 60 solutions, and the like. Combination therapeutic agents may also include R'-Glu-Trp-R\" dipeptide, e.g., L-Glu-L-Trp, in the same unit dosage form. Pharmaceutical carriers can, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients, and the like. Thus, for purposes of oral administration, tablets containing various excipients such as sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, and calcium phosphate32 may be employed along with various disintegrants such as starch, and preferably potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, and certain complex silicates, together with binding agents such as polyvinylpyrolidone, sucrose, gelatin, and acacia. 5 A dditionally, lubricating agents, such as m agnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in salt and hard-filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials for this purpose include lactose jo or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. W hen aqueous suspensions of elixirs are desired for oral administration, the essential active R'-Glu-Trp-R\" dipeptide therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, colored matter or dyes, and if desired, emulsifying or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, and combinations thereof For parenteral administration, solu\u00ad tions of R'-Glu-Trp-R\", analogs, or receptor fragments in sesame or peanut oil or in aqueous polypropylene glycol may be employed, as well as sterile aqueous saline solutions of the corresponding water soluble pharmaceutically accept\u00ad able metal salts previously described. Such an aqueous solution should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal injection. The sterile aqueous m edia employed are all readily obtainable by standard techniques well known to those skilled in the art. Additionally, it is possible to administer the aforesaid compounds topically (e.g., through a placed catheter) using an appropriate solu\u00ad tion suitable for the purpose at hand. The following examples are provided to further elucidate the invention, but are not intended to restrict the invention in scope or spirit in any way. Experimental animal trials (disclosed herein in EXAMPLES 26-36) determined the effects of L-Glu-L-Trp at dosages of about 10 /rg/kg to about I mg/kg on different lymphocyte subpopulations and lym\u00ad phoid organs in vivo. The results of the studies disclosed in EXAMPLES 26-36 are summarized in TABLES A -D . The results indicate that in an experimental animal model, treat\u00ad ments with L-Glu-L-Trp at a dosage of about 0.1 mg/kg to about I mg/kg was effective i) to increase CD2+ lympho\u00ad cytes in peripheral blood by about 3-fold; ii) to increase Fe receptor bearing lymphoid cells in spleen and bone marrow (BM) by about 1.3-fold and about 1.7-fold, respectively (TABLE A); iii) to mobilize cells from the spleen and thymus into peripheral blood with resultant reduction in spleen and thymic mass (TABLE B); and, iv) to increase neutrophil infiltration into tissues in response to an inflam\u00ad matory agent by about 2-fold with about a 1.7-fold increase 50 in phagocytically active cells in the infiltrate (TABLE C).

The observed respective immuno\u00ad logic effects of L-Glu-L-Trp are compatible with the inter\u00ad pretation that the subject treatments of the invention heighten the state of innate immunity to infection in a subject so treated. In certain therapeutic uses it may prove useful to monitor 40 dipeptide levels in bodily fluids while escalating the dose delivered to the patient. The representative R'-Glu-Trp-R\" dipeptide, e.g., L-Glu-L-Trp, is non-mutagenic in vitro, non-toxic to human and guinea pig lymphocytes in vitro, non-toxic when in injected intraperitoneally into guinea pigs 45 and mice, and without adverse effects in human preclinical trials, as disclosed in the EXAMPLES. Analogs of R'-Glu-Trp-R\" The amino acid sequence of the R'-Glu-Trp-R\" dipeptide permits preparation of appropriate nucleotide sequences (e.g., by standard techniques), and incorporation of these sequences into bacterial, yeast, and insect plasmid DNA, as well as into mammalian cell viral vectors (e.g., retroviral vectors.) Expression systems that may be used to produce the peptides o f the invention include prokaryotic, 55 eukaryotic, yeast, and insect cells. It is presently believed likely that EW is a cytomedine released from hydrolysis of tissue polypeptides, at a rate homeostatically determined by tissue pEl and enzymatic activity in the tissues. The present disclosure serves as a useful basis for constructing deriva- 60 tized and covalently modified EW analogs, antagonists, and the like which can be screened and tested for biological activities. For example, EW may be used for preparation of an analog that is, e.g., a) covalently modified a sterioisomer of an L-Glu-L-Trp, e.g., replacing a D- for an L-sterioisomer, and34 the like; c) a derivative of EW, wherein one amino acid is substituted for another of like properties, i.e., a neutral nonpolar amino acid for another neutral nonpolar (e.g., W replaced by S, T, Y, N, Q, or C), an acidic amino acid for 5 another acid (e.g., E replaced by D), or a basic amino acid for another basic (e.g., K replaced R or El); d) a chemically modified form of EW, e.g., a C-terminal (or gamma- carboxyl) group modified to a carbonyl, or an N-terminal group modified to an amide, or N- or C-terminal extension to with Sar or gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA); e) a chemically derivatized form of EW, e.g., covalent coupling of the IM peptide to a larger peptide (or polypeptide) carrier, or an N- or C-terminal extended peptide; or, f) replacing-one amino acid with another of slightly different properties, e.g., 15 changing the hydrophobicity of the dipeptide. Alternative methods for identifying the subject R'-X-Trp-R\" dipeptides of the invention are disclosed in U.S. Ser. No. 08/370,838, incorporated herein by reference. \"Analog\" is intended to mean a chemical compound 20 according to Formula I\u2014 III, that mimics or improves on the electronic, steric, hydrophobic, and 3-dimensional space filling requirements of the groups in an EW dipeptide that are involved in binding to a cellular EW-receptor (e.g., alpha side chain residues, and/or the amino and carboxyl groups in 25 L-Glu-L-Trp). Representative analogs include chemical mimetic compounds that are capable of antagonizing bind\u00ad ing of EW to a ligand-receptor, i.e., antagonists (as defined below), and other ligands that are capable of binding to a ligand receptor and exerting effects similar to EW, i.e., 30 agonists (as defined below). \"Agonist\" as used herein means a chemically modified EW, or organic chemical molecule according to Formula I\u2014 III, that is capable of spatially conforming to the molecular space filled by an EW ligand and that is further capable of 35 combining with the subject ligand receptors to initiate an action that is initiated by EW following binding to their specific ligand receptor(s) on cells in vitro or in vivo. Representative examples of actions initiated by EW may be: i) upregulation of lymphocyte and the like; ii) macrophage activation; iii) stimulating (or inhibiting) lymphocyte blastogenesis in response to antigen (or mitogen), iv) stimulating mobilization of intra\u00ad cellular calcium (e.g. through membrane calcium channels) and cAMP; vi) stim ulating cell interactions between T-helper lymphocytes, B-Iymphocytes and antigen present\u00ad ing cells in initiation of primary and secondary humoral 50 (antibody-mediated) immune responses; vii) stimulation of macrophages to increase their antibacterial and cytotoxic activities to microbial and mammalian target cells, and the like. Agonists possess binding affinity for ligand-receptor(s) and intrinsic activity for inducing the immune effects that are induced when EW bind to their ligand receptor. A screening assay for identifying a candidate R'-Glu-Trp-R\" agonist, may consist of the following steps: (a) synthesizing a chemical mimetic compound, e.g., a compound of Formula I, II, or III; (b) introducing the compound into a T-cell rosette assay as a test article; and (c) determining that the test article has an activity substantially similar to the activity of L-Glu- L-Trp in the T-cell rosette assay. \"Antagonist\" as used herein means a chemical molecule according to Formula I\u2014 III, that spatially conforms to the molecular space filled by EW and is further capable of combining with the subject ligand receptor(s), as set forth above, to inhibit, neutralize, impede or reverse, at least in 5,807,830 35 part, an action initiated following binding of EW to the subject ligand receptor on a lymphocyte or a macrophage. A screening assay for identifying a candidate R'-Glu-Trp-R\" antagonist analog, may consist of the following steps: (a) synthesizing a chemical mimetic compound, e.g., a com- 5 pound of Formula I, II, or III; (b) introducing the analog into a T-cell rosette assay as a test article; and (c) determining that the test article inhibits the activity of L-Glu-L-Trp in the T-cell rosette assay. for analogs, e.g., antagonists and agonists, may include comparative testing of the subject test articles for biological activities exhibited by L-Glu-L-Trp in vivo in experimental animal model systems (e.g. Examples 1-44). Alternatively, it may prove convenient to monitor 15 activities of the test agents in in vitro assays wherein L-Glu-L-Trp have been shown to exhibit biologic activity, e.g., changes in calcium flux or cyclic nucleotide levels, and changes in intracellular second messenger pathways trig\u00ad gered by the addition of L-Glu-L-Trp to lymphocytes. Biological activity of a compound according to Formula II or Formula III of Example 45 may for example be deter\u00ad mined by testing for second messenger pathways triggered by receptor binding the subject compound. Second messen\u00ad ger pathways may be monitored, e.g., by testing arachi- donic acid metabolites, prostaglandins, and the like. The present disclosure of significant biological effects of 30 EW dipeptides on immune cells also serves as basis for isolating cell surface receptors binding EW, and for identi\u00ad fying other ligands in biological fluids which may bind to the subject receptors. \"Ligand\" as used herein refers to a compound that is capable of filling the three-dimensional space in a receptor binding site so that electrostatic repulsive forces are minimized, electrostatic attractive forces are maximized, and hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding forces are maxi\u00ad mized. L-Glu-L-Trp is a representative ligand. Ligands bind to their specific receptors in a specific and saturable manner. A candidate ligand may be tested to determine whether it is an analog by radiolabeling the candidate ligand and then testing whether its binding to lymphocytes is specifically and competitively inhibited in the presence of an excess (e.g., 1000-fold molar excess) of unlabeled L-Glu-L-Trp. Alternatively, a test may be conducted to determine whether the candidate ligand inhibits binding of radiolabeled L-Glu- L-Trp to lymphocytes. A positive test result in either assay may be taken as an indication that the candidate ligand is an 50 analog. A negative test result in either assay is indetermi\u00ad nant. \"Ligand receptor\" is used herein to refer to a receptor capable of binding a ligand, according to the definition above, in a specific and saturable manner. In an illustrative assay for identifying a ligand receptor in a sample of cells, a labeled ligand (e.g., a radiolabeled or biotin-labeled L-Glu- L-Trp) at a concentration from within the range of 0.1 nM to 10 mM, is incubated at room temperature, 37\u00b0 C., and 4\u00b0 C. with an aliquot of about IO5IO7 cells. Following the 60 incubation, the cells are washed (e.g., by centrifugation through an isobutylpthalate or sucrose cushion) and the amount of labeled ligand associated with the cell pellet is determined (e.g., by quantifying radioactivity or reacting the sample w ith enzymatically-labeled avidin, washing to 65 remove unbound avidin, and then adding substrate to visu\u00ad alize the enzyme-bound-avidin-biotin receptor complex).36 The data obtained in this manner may be plotted in a Scatchard plot from which an association constant (Ka) of the receptor for the ligand may be determined. The associa\u00ad tion constant for binding of a ligand (e.g., EW dipeptide) is about 0.01 nM to about I nM, and most preferably about I nM to about 50 . Affinity chromatography e.g., on solid phase resins containing immobilized EW dipeptide (EW- resin), may prove useful for preparing substantially purified preparations of the subject EW receptors and their frag- 10 ments. Purified EW receptors and receptor fragments may be useful as pharmacological inhibitors, antagonists, and ago\u00ad nists of EW dipeptide binding in vivo. Receptor fragments may for example be isolated by affinity chromatography of crude cell and tissue hydrolysates on EW-resin columns, or alternatively, by binding the receptor to an EW-resin and then treating with one or more selected proteases to create EW receptor fragments which are either eluted from the column (i.e., non-ligand binding portions of the receptor), or remain ligand-binding portions which remain bound to the 20 resin. The ligand-binding portions of the receptor may be eluted from the resin either by raising the salt concentration (e.g., to I^ lM NaCl, or 0.5-2M guanidine HCl) to negate electrostatic binding interactions, or by dropping the pH to induce a conformational change in the receptor fragment. 25 The amino acid sequence of the EW receptor is conveniently determined by automated amino acid sequencing, and the sequence may be used to construct synthetic peptides, and nucleotide probes (e.g., degenerate probes) for cloning the subject EW receptor. \"Ligand-receptor fragments\" is a term used to refer to portions of the subject ligand receptor that are smaller in size than a ligand receptor isolated from a natural source, e.g., tissue, biological fluids and the like. Fragments may be prepared from a ligand receptor isolated from a tissue and 35 then subjected to proteolytic degradation or treatment with a chemical such as cyanogen bromide. In the latter case, the subject fragments of the receptor are conveniently purified before use, e.g., by reverse-phase HPLC or immunoaffinity chromatography. Alternatively, fragments of the ligand 40 receptor may be prepared by expressing a portion of a nucleotide sequence of a genomic or cDNA clone capable of expressing the subject ligand receptor, e.g., a portion of ligand receptor nucleotide sequence in an expression plas\u00ad mid or vector introduced into a cell, wherein the cell 45 manufactures the subject receptor fragment and the fragment can be purified (as above). Fragments of the subject ligand receptor may be soluble in biological fluids and aqueous solutions and may bind EW with a greater or lesser Kc than a complete (non-degraded) ligand receptor. \"Substantially purified\" as used herein with respect to peptides refers to a preparation from a natural source that contains either a \"peptide\" (i.e., intended to mean about 2 to about 18 amino acids), a ligand according to criteria set forth above, or a ligand receptor or receptor fragment that is: i) 55 enriched greater than about 50-fold from its concentration in a natural source material, and ii) contains less than 5% peptide or polypeptide impurities detectable by reverse- phase or immunoassay. Inhibitors of R'-Glu-Trp-R\" The disclosure herein of biological activities of EW dipeptides provides a basis for identifying and isolating proteins that either proteolytically inactivate EW dipeptides, or that alter binding of these dipeptides to EW receptors. \"EW-peptidase\" are used herein to refer to dipeptidylpepti- catalyzing hydrolysis the glutamyl- tryptophane peptide bond. The subject inactivate EW peptides and render them biologically inactive. 5,807,830 37 EW-peptidases may conveniently be purified from tissues and cells using conventional purification methods (e.g., affinity chromatography on EW-resin columns, as above, alternatively, ion exchange and/or molecular sieve chroma\u00ad tography using FPLC or ElPLC systems). Purification may be using colorimetric or fluorescent EW peptide substrates, and protease test assays. The subject protease test assays may, in turn, prove useful for identifying natural and synthetic inhibitors of EW-peptidases. The subject EW dipeptidylpeptidase inhibitors may have biological effects similar to EW, since they may decrease proteolytic degra\u00ad dation of EW dipeptide and thus increase the biological half-life of a natural EW dipeptide arising endogenously within a tissue. The present disclosure further provides a basis for diag- 15 nostic immunoassays, antibody reagents and the like for measuring levels of EW in biological fluids. While the subject EW dipeptides are relatively nonimmunogenic, (falling into the class of low molecular weight haptens), antibodies may be induced in experimental animals when 20 they are conjugated to a carrier (e.g., KLEl). Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to EW find uses in a variety of immunoassay formats for diagnostic monitoring the levels of the subject dipeptides in bodily fluids in health and disease. Representative immunoassay formats include: cascade assay for\u00ad mats that are routinely used in the art for increasing low-end sensitivity of assays. Individuals with high levels of EW 30 dipeptide may be at decreased relative risk for infectious disease, while those with decreased levels may be at an increased relative risk. The EW dipeptide can be used as a positive and a negative control in the subject diagnostic assays. The subject assays may be assembled for use in a reagent immunoassay test kit. The antibodies disclosed herein specific for EW may be useful in a variety of competitive and non-competitive direct and indirect immu\u00ad noassay formats as will be apparent to skilled artisans. The level of EW in a biological sample is commonly determined by comparison with positive and negative controls and assay calibrators. The term \"biological fluids\" is used herein to mean tissue fluids (such as joint fluid, cerebrospinal fluid and the like), plasma and serum, fluids in body cavities (i.e., peritoneal 45 fluid, lung lavage fluid, urogenital mucus secretions, and the like), urine, feces, sputum, sweat, and the like. While not wishing to be tied to any particular molecular mechanisms of action, cytomedines are believed to interact with cellular receptors. Traditionally, cellular receptors have 50 been believed to bind specific ligands with a specific affinity. Binding (or non-binding) of the ligand to the cellular recep\u00ad tor is believed to induce certain cellular functions. It is further believed that cytomedines interact with these cellular receptors. In addition to the ligand-binding site, however, the receptors apparently have separate cytomedine-binding sites. It is believed that receptor-cytomedine binding can alter the conformation of the ligand-binding site so as to increase the affinity of the receptor for the ligand, thereby altering the response of the cell to a particular concentration of ligand within the microenvironment of the cell. Different cytomedines and different cytomedine concentrations can have varying effects on the binding affinity between the receptor and the ligand. Situations may exist in which cytomedine ligands interact with cellular receptors that have secondary binding sites for molecules other than the cytomedine, and in this case, the cytomedine receptor inter-38 action may alter the binding for the other molecule. For example, when the dipeptide Glu-Trp interacts with T cells, there is an increase in receptor binding affinity for CD48, CD58, or CD59, and an accompanying increase of intrac- 5 ellular cAMP concentrations in the cells. Increased intrac\u00ad ellular cAMP in turn activates intracellular protein kinase activity. Protein kinase activity is an important factor in the signal transduction pathway for activating transcription and trans- 10 lation of proteins necessary for lymphocyte activation and progression of the cell division cycle from G0ZG1 into mitosis. Tryptophane containing dipeptides (e.g., EW, DW, NW, and the like) may constitute improved delivery vehicles for the amino acid tryptophan. Tryptophan is con\u00ad vertible by 5-hydroxy-tryptam serotonin) and by mono-amino oxidase enzymes into 5-hydroxy-indol-acetic acid in the pathway to melatonin. 25 Serotonin is capable of binding to beta-adrenergic receptors, adrenoreceptors, serotonergic receptors, e.g., on endothelial cells, vascular bronchial muscle, neural cells, platelets, lymphocytes, CD 4+-lymphocytes, and myocardial cells. M etabolically modified EW, e.g., modified to glutamyl-serotonin, may be rapidly hydrolyzed to release serotonin into tissues and blood. While not wishing to be tied to any particular mechanism of action, it is believed likely that the subject tryptophan- containing peptides reversibly associate with specific cellu- 35 Iar EW receptors, one example being provided by the T-Iymphocyte E-rosette receptor defined as the \"CD2\" cell surface determinant. It is believed likely that binding of EW dipeptide to CD2 (and other EW receptors) trigger: i) conform ational changes in the receptor that signal 40 up-regulation of adenylate cyclase and increased intracellu\u00ad lar cAMP, and; ii) increased affinity of the CD2 receptors for binding of EW dipeptides. It is presently believed likely that L-Glu-L-Trp exerts its immunomodulatory effects by bind\u00ad ing to EW-receptors and stimulating increased expression and/or affiniity of CD2 molecules on T-Iymphocytes and thymocytes. It is considered likely that increases CD2 expression or binding affinity. Intracellular mechanisms trig\u00ad gered by dipeptide binding to the receptor may mediate: (a) changes in lymphocyte tissue distribution, i.e., mobilization of one or more subsets from lymphoid tissues into peripheral blood, (b) activation of one or more lymphocyte subsets; and/or (c) down- or up-regulation of the functional activity of one or more lymphocyte subsets. The changes induced at a cellular and molecular level by a tryptophane-containing 55 dipeptide may result in immune deviation, wherein an immune response (i.e., cellular or humoral) directed toward one antigen is down-regulated and a response to a different antigen is up-regulated. As disclosed in the Examples section, increased T-Iymphocyte counts in peripheral blood 60 is a visible manifestation of the mobilization from lymphoid tissues induced by treatment with EW dipeptides. Increased cytokine production, e.g., as assayed by leukocyte migration inhibition response (LMIR), is another particular manifes\u00ad tation of activated T-lymphocytes. Activation of mono- 65 nuclear phagocytes (e.g., monocytes) is manifested by increased phagocytic activity, e.g., phagocytosis of latex or staphylococci, and activation of granulocytes is manifested 5,807,830 39 as increased cell numbers in inflammatory exudates as well as increased phagocytic activity. Effects of tryptophane- containing dipeptides on immunoresponsiveness of animals and man are disclosed in the Examples which follow. It is considered possible that the CD2 receptor on lymphocytes may bind serotonin. EXAMPLE I Lack of Mutagenicity and Toxicity of L-Glu-L-Trp Note that the Materials and Methods used in Examples 1-34, below, appear immediately following Example 46, i.e., at the end of the Examples section immediately before the citations. Protocol A Mutagenicity: On peripheral blood of human volunteers in vitro. Cell cultures were incubated and treated. As can be seen from Table I, after 24 hrs. incubation at concentrations of I /rg/mL and 100 /rg/mL, there was statistically no mutagenic effect in these cultures.

Protocol B Acute Toxicity Studies Summary: L-Glu-L-Trp when injected im at dosages calculated to be about 1 0,0 0 0-times the therapeutic dosage were found to be non toxic in mice, guinea pigs, chickens, and dogs as determined by monitoring general condition, behavior, movements, cardiac and respiratory physiology, and gross pathology. Protocol C Chronic Toxicity Studies Summary: L-Glu-L-Trp when injected daily as a single im or iv for a period of 30 days was without adverse effects as determined by monitoring behavior, feeding, body weight, coat condition, mucous membranes, red and white cell blood counts, cardiac and respiratory physiology, liver and kidney function, and gross pathology. Kidney function was deter\u00ad mined by evaluation of diuresis after water-loading; for certain other experiments animals were sacrificed and exam\u00ad ined after 10, 20, 30, and 60 days. EXAMPLE 2 Accidental Radiation Induced Immunodeficiency: Chernobyl Background: On Apr. 26, 1986 the largest nuclear catas\u00ad trophe of our time took place at 1:24 a.m. local time,40 destroying the fourth reactor of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (NPP). The reactor and its core were reportedly destroyed by an explosion causing two radioactive jet emis\u00ad sions of Iodine 131 followed by Cesium 137 and gamma emis- 5 sions (Milhaud, G., Biomedicine & Pharmacology 45(6) :219-220 (1991)). The accident reportedly cause the deaths of 31 workers and firemen who intervened to bring the installation back under control, 203 individuals were hos\u00ad pitalized with acute radiation sickness, and more than 135, 10 000 persons were evacuated from the 30 km zone immedi\u00ad ately adjacent to the N PP Initial optimism that there would be no residual after affects, were not justified. Studies of individuals exposed to radiation at the Chernobyl NPP have reported doses of whole body exposure at 0.1-0.5 Gy for 15 individuals involved in the clean-up; 4-9 Gy for power plant workers (Yarilyn, A. A., et al., Intl. J. Radiation Biology 63(4):519-528 (1993)); and a range of 0.1-12.5 Gy for accidental exposure of different individuals in the 135,000 inhabitants within the 30 km zone surrounding the NPP 20 (Barkhudarov, R. Radiobiologiia 32(1):3-18 (1992)) Russian physicians treating the exposed individuals reported a correlation between the numbers of lymphocytes in peripheral blood and the severity of the 25 acute radiation sickness, with an initial drop in the average numbers of lymphocytes to 50% of normal by day 3-6 post-exposure (Suvorova, L. A., et al., Radiobiologiia 31 291-6 (1991)). Decreased lymphocyte counts are reportedly correlated with the severity of radiation sickness (Hirsh, E. 30 P., et al., World J. Surgery 16(5): 918-923 (1992)). Hema\u00ad tological data have also been used to construct an empirical dose curve for gamma radiation exposure at Chernobyl and values reported for 127 of the former residents range from 0.5 Gy to 12 Gy (Konchalovskii, . V., et al., Radiologiia 36(1): 29-33 (1991)). Por reference, 10 Gy is a 1 0 0% bone marrow lethal dose of radiation in mice as determined 30 days post-exposure (Hendrickson, R R., et al., CLINICAL ONCOLOGY, eds: Holleb, A. I., et al., Amer. Cancer Soc., Atlanta, Ga., p. 42 (1992))). Human 40 exposure to 2 Gy of whole body irradiation daily for 2 days (4 Gy total), has been reported to result in decreased erythrocyte and granulocyte precursors in bone marrow. Daily exposure to 2 Gy whole body irradiation for 5 days (10 Gy total) has been reported to result in a total absence of 45 undifferentiated and differentiated cellular forms and blast cells in the bone marrow with maximal depression of peripheral blood lymphocytes counts being evident at 10-15 days and cell counts approaching only 40% of normal. Reportedly, recovery generally occurs after 3-6 months. 50 (Mettler, R A., et al., MEDICAL EPPECTS OP IONIZING RADIATION, Grune & Stratton Inc., N.Y.; p. 165 (1985)). Approximately 120,000 former Chernobyl residents are currently reportedly being followed to determine long term effects of radiation exposure. In patients suffering from acute 55 radiation sickness during the accident, immune defects have been reported three to five years later with decreased circu\u00ad lating T- and B-Iymphocytes and increased levels of al., undifferentiated cells in peripheral blood, increased neutrophil counts, and reduced numbers of lym\u00ad phocytes increased morbidity J. Environ. Akusherstvo I Ginekologiya 11: 42-45 (1991)); Ivanov, al., Akusherstvo I Ginekologiya 11:42-45 (1991)); Ivanov, A. A., et al., GematologiyalTransfuziologiya 36(12) :20-22 (1991)). In geographic regions adjacent to Chernobyl, population epidemiologists reported increased rates of respiratory virus 10 infection (in Kiev; Vozianov, A. F., et al., Vrachebnoe Delo 3: 14-17 (1991)), and increased tuberculosis mortality (in Byelorussian SSR; Kalechits, 11: 12-14 (1990)). Five years after 15 the accident, experimental rats exposed for 30 days to ground radiation in the 30 km Chernobyl disaster zone reportedly received a cumulative body dose of 57 rads (I Gy=IOO rads) and exhibited aberrations in bone marrow m etaphases and peripheral blood leukocyte counts (Izmozherova, et al .,Radiobiologiia 32(4): 493-9 (1992)). It has been suggested that exposure to sublethal levels of radiation may cause premature aging of T-Iymphocytes with lessened tumor surveilance activity (Davila, D. R., et al .,Int. J. Radiation Biol. 611: 123-133 (1992)); Sasaki, H., et (suppl.): 310-326 (1991)). CD4+ T-Iymphocytes are reportedly more radiosensitive than CD 8+ (DeRuysscher, et al., Eur. J. T., et al., Radiologia Medica 81(4): 532-536 (1991)). The chief methods of therapy for individuals exposed to radiation in the Chernobyl zone were reported to be admin\u00ad istration of antimicrobial drugs and fresh donor platelets (i.e., \"Conventional Therapy\", in Protocols A -E , below). Stem cell transplantation using allogeneic bone marrow 3 5 reportedly showed limited efficacy (Baranov, A. E., et al., Meditsinskaia Radiologiia 36((3): 29-32 (1991)). Summary Overview of Protocols A -E , below: In all, 348 Chernobyl residents and workers were examined (20-50 years of age; 320 men and 28 women). The state of the 40 immune systems in these individuals was determined in the field using peripheral blood samples and rosette-forming lymphocyte methods. In certain studies, patients were exam\u00ad ined during hospitalization and T- and B-Iymphocyte popu\u00ad lations were determined using a flow cytometer and mono- 45 clonal antibodies specific for lymphocyte cell surface markers. Radiation exposure levels for the different patients were determined using dosimetry data obtained by the military in Chernobyl using a D-2-P dosimeter. The time course of the immunodepression in these subjects is sum\u00ad marized as follows: subjects in Protocol A, evaluated within the first few weeks after evacuation from Chernobyl showed peripheral blood leukocyte and lymphocyte counts that were only 60% of normal (\"Before\", TABLE 2). By 2 months (Protocol B) the lymphocyte counts in patients presenting 55 for therapy had fallen to about 40% of normal (\"Before\", TABLE 3), but by six months (Protocols C; D) improvement was noted, i.e., to 76% of normal (\"Before\", TABLE 5). Changes in total lymphocyte counts over the latter 6 month period were mirrored by increased numbers of CD4+ Iym- 60 phocytes (i.e., from 10% at 4-5 months (TABLE 4) to 43% at 6 months (TABLE 5); and CD 8+ T-Iymphocytes (i.e., from 39% at 4\u2014 5 months to 71% at 6 months). Immunomodulator therapy was initiated in 1986 with Thymalin, (a mixture of thymic peptides, the preparation of 65 which was disclosed by some of the instant inventors in DE 3,421,789, Morozov, V. G., et al., (1985)). Treatments were42 administered to patients presenting in the clinic within the first few weeks after the Chernobyl NPP accident, and again at 2 months, 4-5 months, and 6 months (Protocols A -D , below). Thymalin was administered prophylactically to a small group of workers who participated in sealing the roof of reactor III (Protocol E). In addition, the immunomodu\u00ad latory synthetic peptide L-Glu-L-Trp was administered to certain patients at three years post-exposure (i.e., Protocol E, below). Treatments with Thymalin were administered as 5 daily injection of 10 mg. Treatments with L-Glu-L-Trp were administered as 5 daily im injections of 100 % each. The effects of the treatments on leukocytes were monitored in the week following treatment by collecting samples of periph\u00ad eral blood from the different patients. Protocol A: Early Values The 42 patients described below, were tested for blood 20 parameters the first few days to weeks after exposure to 0.2-0.5 Gy of environm ental radiation in Chernobyl (\"Before\") and then again after a 5 days of Thymalin therapy (daily doses of 10 mg im; \"After\"). A control group of 34 Chernobyl subjects received conventional therapy (i.e., 25 a n tih ista m in e s, m u ltiv ita m in s, and treatm en ts for symptoms). The majority of the subjects in this trial protocol, upon clinical examination, presented with com\u00ad plaints of weakness, scratchy throat, cough, acute eye pain, and a metallic taste in the mouth. Upon examination, hype- 30 remia of the fauces and conjunctiva was revealed. No pathology was identified in the internal organs on gross examination. It can be seen from the data in TABLE 2 that a response to the Thymalin treatment was observed in the treatment population even at this early time after radiation exposure in Chernobyl.

Examina\u00ad tion of individuals in this latter group revealed indications of 35 immune dysfunction. Twenty-three such adult patients, exposed to 1.0-3.0 Gy of radiation, were treated at 2 months, and again at 6 months post-exposure. The patients received 10 mg Thymalin daily for 5-10 consecutive days by intra\u00ad muscular injection. Twelve normal healthy individuals were evaluated in a control group to establish normal immune parameters. The results of the evaluation (\"Before\") and treatment (\"After\") at 2 months are shown in TABLE 3.40 45Treatment o f Radiation-Induced Im m unodeficiency: Treatments w alin M onths adiation _____________________ ml Group H ealthy A ccidental Irradiation 15Indicia3Norm _ ith % 65.0 \u00b1 2.1 120 \u00b1 17* 90 \u00b1 19, % 22.0 \u00b1 1.7 32 \u00b1 3* 2 7 \u00b1 4 0.03 0.26 4^ 0 .87 \u00b1 0.07 After-treatm ent value/Before-treatm ent value; *- statistically significant (p < 0.05) in com parison w ith the indices in healthy normal subjects; **- statistically significant (p < 0.05) in com parison w ith the data obtained prior to ing cells. 30 The results in TABLE 3 show a statistically significant increase in circulating leukocytes, lymphocytes, and CD2+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood following treatment with Thym alin. No change in C D 19+ p erip h eral blood B-Iymphocytes was observed. Simultaneous with the resto\u00ad ration of immune system parameters in peripheral blood, subjects in the Thymalin treated group exhibited a marked decline in symptoms associated with the asthenic syndrome. Clinical improvements induced by Thymalin were main\u00ad tained for 2-4 months post-therapy, after which the clinical condition of the patients again worsened. Control subjects receiving conventional treatment did not exhibit any statis\u00ad tically significant change in immune parameters. 50 55 60 65Protocol C: Therapy at 4 and 6 Months Post- Exposure Acute radiation sickness (ARS) was manifest at 2-6 months in many patients. Seven patients with ARS after exposure to 1.0-2.0 Gy of radiation in Chernobyl were treated at 4-5 months post-exposure with 100-150 mg Thymalin daily for 10-15 days ( I \" course) followed by 10 mg Thymalin once a week for a period of 18 months ( 2nd course).

This subset of patients included 32 patients who were tested for blood parameters at 6 months, and then treated with Thymalin at a dosage of 10 mg daily 5 for 1 0 consecutive days in the hopes of stabilizing immune parameters. Twenty other patients served as a control group, and they were treated using conventional methods. The results presented in TABLE 5 show marked decreases in T- jo and B-Iymphocyte subpopulations in patients prior to therapy with reduced CD2-DR+-, CD2+-, CD3+-, and CD4+ -lymphocyte counts and decreased levels of B-Iymphocytes with surface immunoglobulin.

Correlated with the observed improvements in immune parameters, clinical improvements were observed in the treated patients including a lack of infectious complications over the following two years of observation. Asthenic symp- 35 toms in 5 of the 7 treated patients were brought completely under control. Protocol E: Prophylactic Administration Prior to Irradiation A special investigation of the potential immunoprotective effects of Thymalin was assessed in a group of 20 volunteers who worked on the roof of the Chernobyl NPP reactor III. These subjects were given 10 mg Thymalin daily on each of the three days they worked in the 30 km high radiation zone, 45 with treatments commencing one day before the work on the N PP Twenty other volunteers were given glucose tablets, as a control. The volunteers received a dose of radiation equal to 0.25\u00b10.02 Gy over each of the 1-2 days they worked on the N PP Immune parameters were evaluated before admin- 50 istering Thymalin, and again on day 7 after the completion of the NPP work project. Volunteers who received the placebo demonstrated changes in the number of CD2+-, CD2-DR+-, and CD8+-lymphocytes. In contrast, prophylac\u00ad tic treatment with Thymalin prevented the latter changes in 55 lymphocyte subpopulations. Protocol F: 3 years: L-Glu-L-Trp Treatment An increased incidence of cancer is one sequelae known to occur in subjects exposed to radiation, presumably because of decreased immune surveillance and eliminationof tumor cells. At three years post-radiation exposure, pre\u00ad liminary evaluation of patients exposed to radiation at Chernobyl suggested lingering impaired immunity in 20% of the subjects as evidenced by reduced numbers of CD2- DR+ lymphocytes and depressed leukocyte enzymes. An attempt to normalize immune parameters was attempted in 70 of the latter patients exposed 3 years previously to 0.2-0.5 Gy of radiation at Chernobyl. Evaluation of these 70 40 patients revealed decreased CD2+-DR+ cells (in 100% of the subjects), decreased surface IgM+ B-Iymphocytes (in 49% of the subjects), and nonspecific elevated cytokine produc\u00ad tion in response to Con-A mitogen in the LMIR assay (in 84% of subjects). In general, most of these patients exhibited clinical symptoms of secondary immunodeficiency and asthenic syndrome including cardiovascular alterations and changes in vital signs. The subjects were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp in an attempt to alleviate the immune defects. The treatment course consisted of daily doses of 100 % L-Glu-L-Trp administered im for 3-5 days. Sixty three subjects, similarly exposed to radiation in Chernobyl were used as untreated controls. Mean peripheral blood CD2+ lymphocyte counts following L-Glu-L-Trp treatment were restored to within the normal healthy range of values (TABLE 6), and a restoration of CD2+ counts was observed in 85% of the cases. Improvement in the CD2+ lymphocyte counts was accompanied by improvement in the general condition of the patients and disappearance of symptoms 60 associated with the asthenic syndrome. Normalization of CD2+ lymphocytes did not occur in untreated patients (TABLE 6). 495,807,830 50 TABLE 6 Indices o f Cellular Im m unity and Innate Im m unity in Chernobyl Subject R eceivin g Treatment w ith L-Glu-L-Trp at 3 Years Post-R adiation Exposure _______________ Laboratory Test Results B efore After Indicia Therapy Untreated L-Glu-L-Trp 10 L eukocytes, abs \u00b1 0.3 5.5 \u00b11.0 5.6 \u00b1 0.4 phocytes; abs 2.0 \u00b1 0.3 1.8 \u00b10.23 2.1 \u00b1 0.3 C D 2-D R + , 15 \u00b1 0.3* 18.4 \u00b12.5 2 \u00b1 0.05* 1.12 \u00b10.18 1.21 \u00b1 0.15 C D % 3 6.7 \u00b1 2.6 38\u00b13 3 6.2 \u00b1 1.7 C D 4, abs 0 .72 \u00b1 0.05 0.70 \u00b10.05 0 .74 \u00b1 0.08 C D 8, % \u00b1 0.9* 25.0 \u00b12.7 2 3.2 0.3 -Ig+, abs \u00b1 0.01 0.20 \u00b10.05 \u00b1 4.4 \u00b10.3 4.1 \u00b1 0.6* B 0.08 \u00b10.004 0 .12 \u00b1 \u00b1 0.9 4.6 \u00b10.5 4.8 \u00b1 0.5 B as Ratio = post-treatm ent value/pre-treatm ent value;TABLE 6-continued Indices o f Cellular Im m unity and Innate Im m unity in Chernobyl Subject R eceivin g Treatment w ith L-Glu-L-Trp at 3 Years Post-R adiation Exposure _______________ Laboratory Test Results Before After Indicia Therapy Untreated L-Glu-L-Trp *- statistically significant (p < 0.05) vs. the indices in healthy people; **- statistically significant (p < 0.05) vs. the data obtained before treatment; abs- cell concentration presented as 109/L; igration inhibition.

Summary Overview: A total of 246 patients were even\u00ad tually entered into studies after receiving radiation and chemotherapy. L-Glu-L-Trp w as adm inistered to the patients in single 100 % daily dose for each of 10 days during the period of chemotherapy. A control group consti- 45 tuted 158 sim ilar patients (follow ing radiation and chemotherapy), and these patients were treated in a conven\u00ad tional manner (i.e., chemotherapy and support therapy). Patients treated with L-Glu-L-Trp experienced normaliza\u00ad tion of immunological indices, and a decreased incidence 50 and severity of post-operative complications including upper respiratory infections, nausea, and inflammations exacerbated by the radiation and chemotherapy, i.e., gastritis, cholecystitis, and the like. Immune parameters were periodically monitored over the next 4-6 months in the 55 patients and decreased levels of lymphocytes or their sub\u00ad populations were used as clinical triggers for additional therapeutic intervention with L-Glu-L-Trp. Protocol C Tumor Therapy Thymogen Lfse in Oncology Practice for the Combined Treatment of Patients with Thoracic Cavity Tumors: Surgi\u00ad cal removal of thoracic tumors was followed in 38 patients 65 by focal radiation therapy and then a course of L-Glu-L-Trp therapy consisting of 5 daily im injections of 100 %In this trial treatment, L-Glu-L-Trp decreased the total number of complications (Total) as well as the number of cases of septicemia, cardiopulmonary complications, and 40 mortality. EXAMPLE 4 Respiratory Disease Protocol A: Influenza Prophylaxis Summary Overview: A group of 452 persons were treated with daily dosages of 100 % of L-Glu-L-Trp administered g0 im on each of 5-10 consecutive days. A control group consisted of 250 untreated persons. The incidence of diag\u00ad nosed respiratory diseases and influenza were recorded for both groups over the next four months. The results summa\u00ad rized in TABLES 9 and 10 show that the untreated group had a higher incidence of the respiratory disease, illness, hospi\u00ad talization and disablement than the group treated with L-Glu-L-Trp. 53 TABLE 95,807,830 54 Prophylactic Treatment w ith L-Glu-L-Trp: Effect on the Incidence o f A cu te Respiratory D iseases and Influenza Illness (m ean values) Ratio Treatment Group Control/ Indices S ickness N eed for hospitalization, % A verage term o f hospitalization, days O verall incidence o f lingering and com plicated cases, % Incidence o f lingering and com plicated cases for in-patients, % N um ber o f cases o f temporary disablem ent per 100 persons/m onth Num ber o f days o f temporary disablem ent per 100 persons/m onthL-Glu-L-Trp Control Tx* 9.8 30.4 3.1 0.20 0.50 2.5 30.6 44.9 1.7 6.2 8.8 1.4 3.9 13.8 3.5 9.8 26.2 2.7 4.1 7.0 1.7 26.5 57.6 2.2 20 *Ratio = Value Control/Value L-Glu-L-Trp treated.

L-Glu-L-Trp was administered to 89 young sportsmen (athletes). The control group consisted of 54 young students. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered intranasally daily as a single dose of I Jig/kg on each of 3 consecutive days. L-Glu-L-Trp reduced 50 the rate of upper respiratory infections and illness by 4-fold in the treatment group (i.e., as compared with the controls). In addition, those L-Glu-L-Trp treated individuals who did develop an infection had a far less severe course of infection (than in the control group) and the infections were without 55 complications. Clinical improvement in the L-Glu-L-Trp treatment group was accompanied by the normalization of immunological indices. Trial Population: Students of the Children's and Youth's Sports School (47 boys; 42 girls) were evaluated. The 60 athletic specialties included track and field, rowing, fencing, basketball and swimming. The control group consisted of 30 adolescent boys and 24 girls who did not engage in sports.The trial was conducted in the months of January and February and when acute respiratory infections were wide\u00ad spread in student populations. Therapeutic Protocol: L-Glu-L-Trp was introduced by intranasal instillation of 8-15 drops of a 0.01% solution daily for 3 days. Laboratory Indices of Non-Specific Resistance: The fol\u00ad lowing measurements were taken to evaluate the state of non-specific resistance to infection in the trial and control populations: i) barrier properties of the skin and mucous membranes, ii) humoral factors of immunity (bactericidal activity of serum), iii) serum C3 levels, iv) numbers of neutrophils, their ability to phagocytose yeast, and cellular content of proteins, of lymphocytes to PHA and Con-A (% blast cells), vii) number of B-Iymphocytes (EA- RFC), viii) serum concentrations of IgM, IgG, and IgA (radial immunodiffusion), ix) serum levels of immune complexes, and x) levels of lysozyme in saliva.

In addition, the phagocytic index of neutrophils (i.e., number of yeast phagocytosed per cell) was increased (TABLE 13). 57 TABLE 125,807,830 58 N on sp ecific R esistance to Infection: Salivary L ysozym to post-treatm ent at p < 0.05; < 0.01 TABLE 13 Imm une Function A thletes Controls Functional Indices BeforeAfter L-Glu-L-Trp BeforeA fter ) 34.3 \u00b1 1.6 42.5 \u00b1 2.5** 4 7 .4 \u00b1 6.2 34.1 \u00b1 3.1 B lasts w /C on -A ( % ) 51.3 \u00b1 3.9 5 3.4 \u00b1 3.9 9 5.7 66.8 0 \u00b1 0.06 1.22 \u00b1 0.1 I,Post-treatm ent sign ificantly different than the Pre-treatment values, i.e. p < 0.05; if , post-treatm ent significantly different that pre-treatment values, p < 0.01 Clinical Results: In the two month period of the trial, the overall incidence of acute respiratory infection in the stu\u00ad dents of the Children's and Youth's Sports School was 63.3% in a total school population of 367 adolescents. The rate of infection in the control group of school children not engaged in sports activities was 7.4% (4 children). Incidence of infection in the group of athletes treated with L-Glu-L- Trp was 24.7%. The investigators concluded that under conditions of 40 intense muscular activity in young athletes there appeared to be a decline in functional immune activity as evidenced by decreased LMIR, altered T-helper/T-suppressor ratios, decreased lymphocyte blast responsiveness to mitogens, decreased circulating B-lymphocytes, and decreased serum 4J immunoglobulin levels. It was postulated that the presumed might result from \"insufficient matu\u00ad rity of T-cell populations.\" Treatments with L-Glu-L-Trp were seen as favorably affecting lysozyme levels, LMIR, IgA levels, and C3 levels (TABLE 11). Protocol C. Prophylaxis/Respiratory Infections\u2014 Polar Explorers Summary Overview: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered pro- phylactically to 27 military volunteers with a goal of increasing the subjects' resistance to high-level solar UV 55 radiation in Northern polar marine climates. The control group comprised 24 similarly occupied co-workers. L-Glu- L-Trp was administered intranasally at a dosage of I /rg/kg daily on each of three consecutive days. Prophylactic treat\u00ad ment with L-Glu-L-Trp prevented the occurrence of upper respiratory infections in the treated group which occurred in their co-workers (i.e., the control group). Non-treated sub\u00ad jects exhibited decreases in peripheral blood immune param\u00ad eters suggestive of immunosuppression. Protocol D: Nose, Ear and Throat Infections Summary Overview: One hundred eighty six subjects (186) with diagnosed acute respiratory disease, includingupper airway diseases and viral infections, were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp. A control group consisted of 87 untreated subjects. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered daily im or intra\u00ad nasally at a dosage of 100 % on each of 3-7 consecutive days. Treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp resulted in a milder course of respiratory viral infections in the treatment group than in the control group. Clinically evident symptoms of infection were also decreased in the treated patients, includ\u00ad ing rhinorrhea, sore throat, fever, muscle aches, headaches, and ear pain. Secondary infectious complications were diminished in the treated individuals, and the length of time that medical follow-up was required was also diminished. Protocol E: Influenza Treatments One hundred fifty-six patients (156) with influenza were treated with 100 % L-Glu-L-Trp im or I /rg/kg intranasally on each of 5-10 consecutive days. A control group consti- 50 tuted with entry of 82 influenza patients who remained untreated. Treatments with L-Glu-L-Trp resulted in accel\u00ad erated alleviation of symptoms associated with influenza infection, e.g., joint pain, muscle aches, fevers, chills, and upper respiratory symptoms. Protocol F: Influenza Symptoms and Sinusitis Summary Overview: Fifty-one patients (51) were treated daily for 3-10 days with either 100 % L-Glu-L-Trp admin\u00ad istered im, or I /rg/kg administered intranasally. A control 60 group of 24 similar patients remained untreated. Treatment w ith L-Glu-L-Trp resulted in reduced nasal mucous swelling, normalization of breathing, decreased volume of exudate from affected sinuses, and improved general con\u00ad dition and immune status. The L-Glu-L-Trp treatment 65 decreased the total duration of patient treatment by up to 1.7-fold, i.e., as compared with the length of treatment required for patients in the control group. 5,807,830 59 Protocol G: Combination Therapy; Influenza Symptoms Sixty-six (66) hospitalized patients between the ages 18-20 years with confirmed influenza infections were admit- ted into the trial. Of the patients, 12 were determined to be severely infected, and the remaining 54 seriously infected and in need of hospitalization. The patients were divided into two groups, 35 receiving conventional therapy (control), and the remaining 31 received daily injections of 100 % L-Glu-L-Trp im on each of 3 consecutive days as an adjunct to the conventional ongoing therapy. The patients treated with L-Glu-L-Trp experienced a 3.5-times lower incidence of respiratory complications than the patients in the control group. Patients treated with L-Glu-L-Trp also showed a more rapid normalization of immune parameters, including leukocyte migration inhibition response (LMIR), blastogenic response to PHA and ConA, and levels of IgA and IgM. Protocol H: Influenza with Immune Defects A clinical trial was conducted in a group of 588 patients between the ages of 17-21 years all having a confirmed infection with Influenza A, (i.e., confirmation by either hemagglutination-inhibition or the presence of specific viral 25 antigens). Three hundred fifteen of the patients (315) were ultimately hospitalized and determined to have significant immunological impairment related to their acute viral infec\u00ad tion. Forty-nine patients (49) were treated using a combi\u00ad nation therapy in which L-Glu-L-Trp was administered as an 30 adjunct to the conventional support therapy. The results of this trial showed that L-Glu-L-Trp treatment reduced the percentage of patients w ith secondary com plications (including pneumonia), and decreased the duration of pharyngitis, tracheitis, and the time over which therapy 35 needed to be administered (TABLE 14). Coincident with the improvements in clinical symptoms was an observed increase in the percentage of T-helper lymphocytes, and a change in the T-helper/T-suppressor ratio (TABLE 14).60 immunological indices examined immediately following the period of treatment were restored to within the normal range. Protocol J: Influenza Summary Overview: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered to 268 volunteers as an adjunct to flu vaccination. The control group consisted of 197 subjects receiving flu vaccination but not L-Glu-L-Trp. Flu vaccine was delivered by air pressure injection and L-Glu-L-Trp was administered daily at a dose of 50 g im on each of 3 consecutive days. L-Glu-L-Trp treatment significantly decreased the incidence of sickness in the vaccinated subjects for a period of 12 months com\u00ad pared to controls who received flu-vaccination without 15 L-Glu-L-Trp. In the volunteers receiving L-Glu-L-Trp, if they experienced flu, the course of the infection was noted to be less severe and the recovery more rapid when com\u00ad pared to controls. 20 Protocol K: Pleuritis Summary Overview: Efficacy of L-Glu-L-Trp in com\u00ad bined antibiotic therapy was evaluated in twelve male patients (aged 18 to 45) with suppurative lung diseases that were poorly responsive to antibiotic therapy and accompa\u00ad nied by diffuse pleuritis, disseminated intravascular coagu\u00ad lation (DIC), pleural effusions, and fever. Laboratory tests revealed elevated white cell counts in peripheral blood, decreased lymphocyte counts (TABLE 17), elevated serum fibrin degradation products (FDP) and abnormally (ATIII) levels (TABLE 15). L-Glu- L-Trp was administered to these patients as a treatment of nearly last resort, and as part of the ongoing (unsuccessful) regimen of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy: i.e., 200 % of L-Glu-L-Trp was administered im daily over a period of 5-7 days. A dramatic change was observed in all 12 patients: namely, fever ablated, the volume of pleural effusion decreased, incidences of DIC decreased then disappeared, TABLE 14 Treatment R egim enPharyngitis m anifestationsTracheitis m anifestationsLength o f Required Therapy C om bined Therapy: C onventional + L-Glu-L-Trp Conventional Therapy 4.0 \u00b1 0.3 days7.1 \u00b1 0.3 Treatment egim enSecondary om Therapy Protocol I: Influenza Therapy Summary Overview: Forty-eight volunteers (48) were g Q experimentally infected with influenza, then examined and treated daily by administration of L-Glu-L-Trp at a dosage of 100 g im or I g/kg intranasally over a period of 5-10 days. Thirty-four similarly infected volunteers (34) served as untreated controls. Treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp resulted 65 in normalization of fever, reduction in toxic symptoms, and resolution of icterus (jaundice). The hematological andexam ination of X -rays show ed that infections were consolidated, laboratory tests showed decreases in periph\u00ad eral blood leukocyte counts, FDP levels dropped, and ATIII levels increased to within the normal range. In addition, T-cell counts in peripheral blood increased and IgG, IgM, and IgAincreased (TABLE 17) and C-reactive protein levels fell (TABLE 16). No allergic or adverse effects of L-Glu- L-Trp treatment were observed.

In all cases there was also diagnosis of secondary immune defi\u00ad ciency and thrombohemorrhagic syndrome. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered daily at a dosage of 100 % im daily for 5 days. Laboratory tests were conducted to compare the pre- and post-treatment values with values recorded for normal healthy controls. A control population of children with62 pneumonia was treated with antibiotic therapy alone. The results of the laboratory analyses are presented in TABLES 18-20.

L-Glu-L-Trp treatment appar\u00ad ently decreased the levels of fibrin degradation products, and 35 increased serum ATIII levels. (Similar effects of L-Glu-L- Trp on FDP and ATIII were observed in studies of patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation resulting from pleuritis, Example 4, Protocol E, above.) 40 TABLE 19 Laboratory Indicia o f D isease A ctivity in 11.2 \u00b1 0.1 13.3 \u00b1 0.1 11.0 \u00b1 .4 8 2 \u00b1 0.07 0.70 \u00b1 0.05 0 .84 \u00b1 133 \u00b1 6.6 138 \u00b1 13.6 160 \u00b1 6.9 153 \u00b1 5.2 60 \u00b1 5.9 67 \u00b1 o f D isease A ctivity in Children with Bacterial Pneum onia Conventional L-Glu-L-Trp Antibiotic Com bination C linical Index Therapy Therapy Duration System ic Toxicity (days) 1 0.7 \u00b1 1.6 8.2 \u00b1 0.9 Patient Condition Stabilized (days) 10.6 \u00b1 2.0 6.8 \u00b1 0.7 N orm alization o f B od y Temperature (days) 2 0.5 \u00b1 2.4 13.9 \u00b1 1.7 Favorable R esolution b y X -ray (days) 2 1.9 \u00b1 3.1 19.3 \u00b1 3 4.8 \u00b1 4.8 2 6.2 \u00b1 3.2 A n tibiotics Required (days) 2 5.9 \u00b1 2.0 2 1.4 \u00b1 1.4 H ospital Bed-D ays 4 2.3 \u00b1 2.1 4 1.7 \u00b1 1.5 M ortality % 1.2 0,830 64 acute HIV viral infection and thereby reducing the need to use other medications with potentially toxic side effects. As shown in the Examples below, L-Glu-L-Trp treatments stimulated innate immunity and anti-bacterial cellular immunity in experimental animals. Stimulation of the latter immune mechanisms in HIV infected (or AIDS) patients will result in a reduction in the incidence, duration, or severity of opportunistic infections including respiratory infections. EXAMPLE 6 Dermatologic Diseases Patients were entered into a large ongoing dermatology clinical trial protocol, the results of which are summarized in Protocols A -F, below. Clinical Effects: L-Glu-L-Trp treated patients showed a normalization of body temperature more rapidly than control patients receiving conventional antibiotic therapy, and in 20 patients w ith intrapulm onary infection, the infection resolved more rapidly than in controls, as evidenced by changes in lung opacity on chest X-ray. EXAMPLE 5 25 Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome In separate studies, a total of 21 HIV-infected individuals were studied, including full-blown syndrome, prodromal, and pre-AIDS afflicted individuals who were treated 30 Thympentin. Thympentin and TPI are thymic gland peptide extracts previously disclosed in the scientific literature. Previous comparative studies reveal L-Glu-L-Trp to be more effective than TPI in restoring normal immunologic indices, T-cell functional activity, and T4/T8 ratios. 35 Method of Administration: Sterile saline containing the sodium salt of L-Glu-L-Trp can be administered either im, or by intralymphatic, or intranasal routes each day for 5-10 consecutive days, and the treatments are repeated every 30 days. 40 As reported in Examples 2 and 3, above, immunosup- pressed individuals who have sustained radiation injuries and were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp exhibited excellent res\u00ad toration of immunological indices. Therefore, L-Glu-L-Trp will benefit HIV infected individuals, and AIDS patients, by treating symptoms and complications resulting from theProtocol A: Chronic Staphylococcal Pyoderma Summary Overview: The total clinical trial population eventually under examination consisted of 159 patients with pyoderma, including furunculitis, cellulitis, and folliculitis. Trial Protocol A l, below, details some of the results obtained in this trial. Medications were administered either im or intranasally for 5 consecutive days. Peripheral blood immune indices were decreased prior to treatment and following treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp were restored to within the normal range. Treatments with L-Glu-L-Trp also resulted in a disappearance of skin manifestations and resolution of pyoderma in the treated patients. Clinical improvement was correlated with return of the immune parameters to within the normal range of values. In certain patients, L-Glu-L-Trp was also topically applied as a sterile saline solution of medication for a period of 5 to 10 days at a dosage of I /rg/kg body weight. Protocol A l: Chronic Staphylococcal Pyoderma Patient Population: Efficacy of L-Glu-L-Trp in combined antibiotic therapy was evaluated in 59 patients (aged 18 to 56; 32 men and 27 women) with chronic pyoderma non- responsive to antibiotic therapy. The patients were divided into Group I (n=36; L-Glu-L-Trp combination therapy) and Group 2 (n=23; control), as described below. Diagnosis, at the time of clinical presentation, and the demographics of the patient population are summarized in TABLE 21. The length of illness for the patients in the trial ranged from 5 months to 16 years. TABLE 21 Patient Population Total _______________________ Dem ographics Patient N o.

Staphylococci cultured from 14 patients showed broad spec\u00ad trum resistance to 10 of 15 antibiotics tested. The length of 5 illness was from 6 months to 16 years. Twenty-four of the patients (24) had a clinical history that included recurrence of one or more diseases, e.g., chronic tonsillitis, maxillary sinusitis, dental Staphylococci were isolated from dermal foci of infection in all 30 patients. The latter isolates were resistant to several antibiotics and in 14 patients, the staphylococci were multiple drug resistant, (i.e., resistant to 10 of the 15 antibiotics tested). Group 2 (conventional treatment control) consisted of 23 patients with similar demographics and pyoderma diseases. Therapeutic Protocols: The patients in Group I were treated in a combination, two-stage therapy using antibiotics and L-Glu-L-Trp. Patients in Group 2 received only antibi- 2 Q otics and other palliative therapies. Stage I: In the first stage of the protocol, only L-Glu-L- Trp was administered in the hope of increasing host immune responsiveness and antibiotic sensitivity of the bacteria. At the conclusion of stage I, staphylococci were isolated from the patients and tested for drug resistance. Based on the results of the antibiotic sensitivity testing, an antibiotic was selected for use in Stage 2, below. Stage 2: In the second stage, both L-Glu-L-Trp and the selected antibiotic were administered in combination, and in 30 certain cases a staphylococcal \"autovaccine\" was prepared and used to immunize the patients against their individual staphylococcal strain. The decision on the type of second stage therapy was made on a patient-by-patient basis after e v a lu a tin g the effects o f first stag e th e ra p y on B-lymphocytes, neutrophils, and IgM levels in circulation. If these indicators were significantly elevated then only com\u00ad bination therapy with L-Glu-L-Trp and antibiotic was66 administered in the second stage, however, if the indicators were not elevated, then autovaccine was administered in addition to the antibiotic and L-Glu-L-Trp therapy, i.e., in an attempt to boost an immune response to the bacteria. Treatment Routes: L-Glu-L-Trp treatment was adminis\u00ad tered by two different routes: namely, im (Group 1A) and intranasally (Group IB). Group IA consisted of 17 patients (i.e., 17 of the 36 patients in Group I) who were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp by intramuscular injection of 100 pg daily for 10 5 days. Group IB , the remaining 19 patients in Group I, received L-Glu-L-Trp by intranasal instillation, daily for 5 days, of I mL of a 0.01% solution. (In pharmacokinetic studies of experimental animals, administration of labeled L-Glu-L-Trp by intranasal instillation resulted in rapid, i.e., 15 minutes, appearance of label in peripheral blood.) Results obtained with Group IA and Group IB were not statistically different, so the data were combined for subsequent analysis and the data obtained with Groups IA and IB are presented together in tabular form below. Antibiotics were administered according to established dosages and routes: i.e., penicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, garamycin; administered by intramuscular route. Antibiotics were chosen according to the antibiotic sensitivity of the Staphylococci isolated from 25 the respective patients. (Antibiotic sensitivity was deter\u00ad mined by testing staphylococcal isolates for their sensitivity in an antibiotic sensitivity doubling-dilution assay with the aid of the semi-automatic MIC-2000 system, Dynatech, USA).

Func\u00ad tional activity of peripheral T-lymphocytes, as measured by blastogenesis in response to stimulation with Con-A and PElA m itogens and H SA (hem olytic staphylococcal 60 allergen) antigen, was also apparently depressed in chronic pyoderm a patients and treatm ent w ith L-G lu-L-Trp increased blastogenesis to greater than (or near equal to) the levels produced by healthy volunteers (TABLE 23).TABLE 23 Lym phocyte B lastogenic Activity: Norm al Patients After Blast Transformation H ealthy Before L-Glu-L-Trp (A ntigen) Values Therapy Therapy PH A (%) 35.9 \u00b1 2.6 5 0 .2 \u00b1 2 .7 4 0.2 \u00b1 3.9 C on -A (%) 4 9.4 \u00b1 3.3 7 6.3 \u00b1 4.9 58.3 \u00b1 3.9 H S A (%) 95.1 \u00b1 5 .7 114.5 \u00b1 7.6 84.9 \u00b1 5.5 (N o m ean values w ere significantly different than the Pre-treatment values, i.e. p > 0.05) Multivariant analysis of the immune values and clinical results observed in these studies suggested a direct correla\u00ad tion between the length of staphylococcal infection and the blood levels and immune functions of T -lymphocytes. The g5 results of this trial suggest that immunity mediated by 5,807,830 69 T-lymphocytes may not express itself in chronic staphylo\u00ad coccal skin disease until >2.5-4 years after diagnosis of the infection, despite (or because of) treatment with conven\u00ad tional antibiotics and corticosteroid ointments. In this patient population, antibiotic resistance was apparently correlated 5 with the development of a possible T-Iymphocyte deficiency. Treating the patients' immunodeficiency with L-Glu-L-Trp was apparently correlated with a decrease in antibiotic resistance of the staphylococci isolated from the patients. B-Lymphocytes: The results presented in TABLE 22, 1\u00b0 show decreased absolute B-Iymphocyte levels and surface Ig+ lymphocytes in the trial population, despite increased numbers of surface IgG+ lymphocytes and increased serum levels of IgG and IgA in the peripheral blood samples. Follow ing Stage 2 of L-G lu-L-Trp treatm ent, total B-Iymphocyte counts did not change significantly, but the numbers of surface IgG+ lymphocytes decreased, i.e., from 0.37\u00b10.075xl09/L to 0.19\u00b10.023xl09/L (p<0.05) as pared to normal levels of 0.08\u00b10.008xl09/L. 20 Phagocytic Activity: The results presented in TABLE 22 show an increase in the number of Staphylococci ingested by each peripheral blood phagocytic cell (i.e., phagocytic index), a favorable functional characteristic commonly 25 observed with \"activated\" macrophages and neutrophils. In vitro studies: In a separate in vitro study, lymphocytes from 26 patients of Group I, above, were incubated in tissue culture medium containing 0.01% L-Glu-L-Trp (i.e., 100 ,Mg/mL). An increase in the percentage of E-RFC was 30 observed from 64.2\u00b12.27% to increased from O K T 8+ lym phocytes did not change significantly, i.e., 17.2\u00b11.7% to 17.9\u00b11.4% (p>0.05). 35 (Similar data showing increased OKT4 expression on T-lymphocytes treated in vitro with L-Glu-L-Trp is pre\u00ad sented in other Examples, below.) Clinical Results: Stage I: Clinical results recorded during the first stage of therapy (L-Glu-L-Trp only), included a short-lived aggra\u00ad vation of the dermal diseases in 20 of the 36 patients which occurred after the second day of L-Glu-L-Trp therapy. The aggravation was manifest as an \"intensification of hyper- 4J emia and dermal infiltration around infected foci and an increase in the amount of purulent excretion.\" During con\u00ad tinued administration were strengthened\" . In the cutaneous lesions acceleration of scar tissue formation 50 and re-epithelialization were observed. Bacterial isolates were tested for antibiotic sensitivity, and increased antibiotic sensitivity was recorded for isolates from certain patients. At the time of the trial it was thought possible that L-Glu-L-Trp ^ treatm en t in d u ced sy n th e sis and release o f anti- staphylococcal factor (ASF), a T-cell cytokine that the antibiotic sensitivity of antibiotic-resistant Staphylococci. Staphylococci were isolated from patients before and after treatment in Stage I with L-Glu-L-Trp in order to determine whether a favorable reversal of T-Iymphocyte immunodefi\u00ad70 ciency might lead to a change in the antibiotic sensitivity. The isolated bacterial colonies following Stage I were typed as follows: namely, in 16 patients S. aureus, in 34, S. epidermidis, in 2 saprophytic Staphylococci. In all cases the same types of Staphylococci were isolated following treat\u00ad ment with L-Glu-L-Trp, but in 4 patients the predominant Staphylococci in the isolates changed from S. aureus to S. epidermidis (n-2), and saprophytic Staphylococci (n=2). The results of testing patient isolates for antibiotic sensitivity are summarized in TABLE 24.

Following treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp the Staphylococci isolated from the patients showed increased antibiotic-sensitivity to one, a few, or all antibiotics (notew orthy exceptions being penicillin, bicillin-3, and levomycetin). In certain cases more than a 100-fold increase in antibiotic sensitivity was observed. Thus, it may be concluded that while L-Glu-L-Trp did not completely eliminate penicillin resistance, the phe\u00ad notype of multiple drug resistance (i.e., to antibiotics other than penicillin) was altered following treatment. Stage 2: Clinical results recorded during the second stage of therapy (i.e., w ith L-Glu-L-Trp and an antibiotic, pyrogenal, or autovaccine, above), are summarized in TABLE 25. The clinical findings included absence of sup\u00ad puration from dermal infections, and absence of new erup\u00ad tions of infected foci from the skin as well as complete cicatrization of ulcers and resolution of deep infiltrates. Peripheral blood leukocyte counts also returned to normal 60 values by the end of the therapy and humoral immune activity also appeared to be increased as measured by the absolute levels of serum IgM. 5,807,830 71 72 PatientTABLE 25 Clinical Results: F ollow in g Stage 2 o f Treatment _________ Number o f Patients w ith C linical Result Significantly N o D iagnosis Recovered Improved Improved Effect W acne 3 _ _ _ A b scess and indurative acne 4 I I \u2014 \u2014 Chronic furunculitis 10 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Chronic abscess pyoderm a 5 2 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Chronic ulcerative pyoderm a \u2014 2 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 Totals: 27 8 I 0 0 Long term follow-up: Combination therapy with L-Glu- L-Trp and antibiotics resulted in clinical recovery in 27 patients with chronic pyoderma who previously had recur\u00ad rently failed conventional broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In addition, considerable improvement was noted in 8 patients and improvement was observed in I case. In the 24 latter patients, recovery was stable over a six month 25 period, and in the remaining 3 patients (of the trial) the recurrences of infection were much more mild than those previously documented in the patients' medical histories. Clinical recovery was attained in all patients with chronic recurring osteofolliculitis and folliculitis as well as those 30 with chronic furunculosis. Of 7 patients with papulous pustular acne, clinical recovery was achieved in 4. Of 10 patients with abscessing and indurative acne, clinical recov\u00ad ery was achieved in 6. Of 7 patients with chronic abscessing pyoderma, complete clinical recovery with resolution of 35 infiltrates and cicatrization of ulcers was achieved in 5. During 6-12 months follow-up, relapses were observed in 2 patients with acne vulgaris and I with chronic abscessive pyoderma. No recurrences of disease activity were noted in patients with chronic recurrent osteofolliculitis, folliculitis, and furunculosis. Aggravation of the disease process was observed in one patient with an ulcerative form of chronic pyoderma, i.e., manifested as an increase in the quantity of purulent discharge. No side effects or allergic reactions were observed in these studies. Summary: The three step method of treatment, i.e., I) treating with L-Glu-L-Trp, 2) assessing antibiotic sensitivity of isolates from patients, and 3) selecting and administering an antibiotic to which the bacteria is sensitive, permitted the attending physician to choose for each patient an individual 50 antibiotic with highest anti-bacterial activity. Seventy-eight percent of patients (78%) at the conclusion of Stage I showed a marked and reliable decrease in the microbial inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotic required to inhibit growth of the isolated bacteria in vitro. In vivo, 55 increased antibiotic sensitivity was clinically manifested in 55-75% of the patients studied. At the conclusion of Stage 2 the combined treatment regimen with antibiotic and L-Glu-L-Trp resulted in complete recovery of 27 previously incurable patients. In addition, 8 patients showed significant improvement and I showed moderate improvement. While somewhat unexpected and provocative, the clinical outcome is not without a variety of possible scientific explanations. At least the following possibilities come to mind: i) stimulation of cell mediated immunity in chronic 65 staphylococcal infection leads to immune elimination, or slower growth, of the more resistant populations of bacteria;2q or, ii) L-Glu-L-Trp treatment induces production of a cytok\u00ad ine such as ASF (supra) or of lysozyme release at sites of infection; or, iii) immune mechanisms stimulated by L-Glu- L-Trp induce a down-regulation of the multiple drug resis\u00ad tant phenotype permitting a shift to more antibiotic sensitive bacteria in patients; or, iv) L-Glu-L-Trp may exert a direct antibacterial effect on Staphylococci. Protocol A2: Chronic Staphylococcal Infection Summary Overview: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered to 52 patients suffering from chronic skin diseases caused by antibiotic-resistant Staphylococci. 42 patients with the same pathology but not treated with the immunomodulator were the control group. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered im to 27 patients single daily at 100 % for 5 days and intranasally to 25 patients with the same daily and total dose. Differences between these two methods of application were not noticed. The results of antibiotic sensitivity testing showed that in all the patients with signs of secondary T-immunodeficiency, the antibiotic-sensitivity of the patients' Staphylococci to one, a few, or all antibiotics was increased sharply (more 40 than 100-fold). The increased antibiotic sensitivity permitted the physician to choose an antibiotic for each patient that had previously shown a high level of activity for the bacteria. As a whole, within each group of patients there was a marked and reliable increase in antibiotic sensitivity, i.e, decreased 45 microbial inhibitory concentration (MIC) for all antibiotics studied. The treatment regimen with L-Glu-L-Trp, followed by antibiotic sensitivity testing, and then administration of an individualized antibiotic provided complete recovery in all patients with previously incurable antibiotic resistant staphylococcal infections. Protocol A3: Chronic Staphylococcal Infection and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Patient Groups: Group I constituted 50 patients with diagnosed pyo\u00ad derma: i.e., 29 males and 21 females ranging from 17 to 59 years of age. AU patients in this trial had recurrent episodes of pyoderma and all had previously received conventional therapy including use of antibiotics, without effect. Length 60 of illness was from 6 months to 16 years. Twenty-four of the patients had one (or several) intermittent opportunistic and infectious diseases including: chronic tonsillitis (2), chronic maxillofacial sinusitis and sinusitis granuloma parodontitis cholestitis and pancreatitis (7), chronic gastritis and gastroenteritis (6), chronic bronchitis (I), chronic prostatitis (I), chronic lymphadenitis (2), chronic otitis (I), and focal pulmonary tuberculosis (I). 5,807,830 73 Group IA (a subgroup of Group I) consisted of 32 patients (f7 males and 15 females ranging from 17 to 42 years of age) with chronic pyodermal skin diseases includ\u00ad ing furunculosis, disseminated impetigo, osteofolliculitis, seborrhea and 5 seborrhea complicated by vulgar or abscessing acne. Dis\u00ad eases were characterized by a chronic course or frequent relapses, and at the time of presentation for entry into the trial, all patients had received several prior courses of antibiotic therapy, none of which led to any detectable to clinical improvement. Patients in Group IA were randomly divided into two treatment groups, the first consisting of 16 patients treated with L-Glu-L-Trp according to Therapy A, below, and the second consisting of 16 patients treated (as a control) according to conventional therapeutic methods\u2014 i.e., Therapy B (below). The results obtained with this patient population are summarized in the Tables, below. Group IB consisted of 18 patients (12 males and 6 females ranging in age from 27 to 62 years of age) having atypical forms of pyoderma persisting over 2-15 years and 20 marked by chronic and recurrent courses with extreme resistance to therapy. Patients in Group IB were randomly divided into two treatment groups, the first consisting of 10 patients (7 males and 3 females) treated with L-Glu-L-Trp according to Therapy A, below, and the second consisting of 25 8 patients (5 males and 3 females) treated (as a control) according to conventional therapeutic methods; i.e., Therapy B (below). The results obtained with this patient population are summarized in the Tables, below. Group 2 constituted 22 patients with diagnosed forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE): i.e., 14 males and 8 females ranging in age from 21 to 62 years of age. The time since presentation with a diagnosis of SLE in this patient population ranged from several months to 18 years. AU SLE patients in this trial had dermal manifestations of lupus 35 erythematosus that included discoid disseminated forms of the disease. AU patients had experienced chronic and recur\u00ad rent episodes of pyoderma, and all had previously received conventional therapy, including use of antibiotics, delagil, and external corticosteroid ointments without effect. Patients in Group 2 were randomly divided into two treatment groups, the first consisting of 13 patients (9 men and 4 women) treated with L-Glu-L-Trp according to Therapy A, below, and the second consisting of 9 patients (5 men and 4 women) treated (as a control) according to Therapy B, i.e., 45 conventional therapeutic methods using anti-malarial prepa\u00ad rations and vasoactive agents according to standard dosages and schedules.74 Treatment Protocols: Therapy A: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered im to all patients at a dosage of 100 % in a volume of I mL daily for 5 days. In treatment Protocol A, all patients received L-Glu- L-Trp in combination with antibiotics. Therapy B (conventional therapy control): AU patients in this protocol received the same antibiotics as in Therapy A and a nonspecific stimulatory agent, i.e., Thymogenin instead of L-Glu-L-Trp. Laboratory Tests: Clinical and laboratory parameters of disease activity were monitored including morning body temperature, leukocyte and differential blood cell count, 15 hematology measurements and blood chemistry and immu\u00ad nology determinations including the percentages and abso\u00ad lute numbers of B- and T-lymphocytes, T-helper and T-suppressor cells, and in vitro blast responsiveness of the cells to staphylococcal protein antigen, Concanavalin A mitogen, and staphylococcal protein A. Antibiotic sensitivity of Staphylococci was evaluated in patients before and after treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp or conventional antibiotics including penicillin (I), ampicillin (5), oxacillin (13), monomycin (I), Kefzol (I), Keflin (I), and cephalex (I). Local antibiotics were administered as follows: ampicillin (2), and Rifampicin (I). The hematology and clinical chemistry laboratory test results obtained with the patients in Group 1A, Group IB, and Group 2 may be summarized as follows: 1. Elematology values were within the normal range of values prior to treatment and no significant differences were observed between the pre- and post-treatment values (i.e., either conventional therapy or L-Glu-L-Trp treatment) for clotting time of citrated whole blood that recalcified; prothrombin units; or, fibrinogen concentration in plasma; and, 2. Blood protein values were within the normal range prior to and after therapy for complement protein C3, alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, creatinine, glucose, total protein, and concentrations of chloride, calcium, and sodium. The results of laboratory tests of immune parameters of Groups IA and IB are presented in TABLE 26.

Summary of Clinical Disease Responses in the Patients in Group IB \u2014Atypical Pyoderma: The clinical investigators 6S conducting this trial concluded as follows: \"A clinical analy\u00ad sis of the conducted treatment show that, in comparison with the traditional therapy methods, no important advantages inusing L-Glu-L-Trp were found. Thus, L-Glu-L-Trp treat\u00ad ment did not cause normalization of the immunologic changes found in this group of patients with chronic atypical pyoderma and did not turn out to be effective clinically.\" The results obtained in the patients of Group 2 are summarized below in TABLES 28-29. 77 TABLE 285,807,830 78 Differential C ell Counts and Im m unology Values: Group 2: Pvoderm a in Patients w ith SLE Before Conventional L-Glu-L-Trp Norm al Therapy Therapy Therapy Index Range (n = 22) (n = 9) (n = 13) L eukocytes ( x l0 9/L): 6.7 \u00b1 2.4 6.15 \u00b1 0.23 6.75 \u00b1 0.3 5 .7 4 \u00b1 0 3 6 .4 \u00b1 ( x l0 4 4.3 \u00b1 2.7 (x109/L ): 1.7 \u00b1 1.02 \u00b1 0.08 0 .63 \u00b1 0.08 4 4.3 \u00b1 3.4 2 6.5 \u00b1 x \u00b1 0.81 0.15 1.26 \u00b1 0.15 0 .8 7 \u00b1 0 .1 2 f 0 .53 \u00b1 0 .0 3 n .26 \u00b1 0 .7 2 \u00b1 0.26 0 .9 2 \u00b1 0 .12 \u00b1 0.1 Neutrophils (%): 49.9 \u00b1 11.9 56.8 \u00b1 2.8 5 9 .7 \u00b1 3.7 5 5.3 \u00b1 4.2 ( x l0 9/L): 3.3 \u00b1 1.1 2.6 \u00b1 1.1 1.8 \u00b1 \u00b1 0.8 8.0 \u00b1 0.7 B asoph ils (%) 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 E osinophils (%) 2.7 \u00b1 0 .2 1.8 \u00b1 0.2 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 ^ sta tistica lly significant in com parison w ith the pre-treatment values, i.e., p < 0.01 ^statistically significant in com parison w ith the pre-treatm ent values, i.e., p < 0.05 TABLE 29 Lym phocyte Functional A ctivity: Group 2- Pvoderm a in Patients w ith SLE Blast Trans\u00ad form ation (A ntigen)Normal H ealthy ValuesBefore Therapy (n = 22)Conventional Therapy Control (n = 9)L-Glu-L-Trp Therapy (n = 13) PH A (% o f PBL) C on -A (% o f PBL)35.9 \u00b1 20.7 \u00b1 6.5 (N o m ean values w ere significantly different than the Pre-treatment values, 55 i.e. p > 0.05) Summary of Clinical Disease Responses in the Patients in Group 2\u2014 SLE Patients with Pyoderma: The investigators conducting the trial concluded: L-Glu-L-Trp \"treatment proved more rational and adequate in the plan of correcting the immune shift discovered.

Treatment with delagil in combination with vascular agents\" (i.e., traditional therapy) \"leads to the appearance of 65 additional deviations in the immunity system and requires mandatory external treatment with corticosteroids.\"Protocol B: Psoriasis Summary Overview: A total of 30 patients with psoriasis 45 were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp (Group I) and 30 other psoriasis patients were entered into a control group (Group 2) and treated using conventional treatment. AU patients had at least a 5 year history of unsuccessful antibiotic therapy. The administration of 100 % im or I /rg/kg intranasally daily 50 for a period of 10 days resulted in the improvement in 7% of the patients, significant improvement in 60% of patients, and total recovery in 33% of the patients. Patients with psoriasis in the progressive phase exhibited i) a depression of cell mediated immune parameters, ii) an increase in serum concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM, iii) hyper-coagulation, and, iv) depressed fibrinolytic activity. Patient Groups: Group I constituted 30 patients, aged 15-60 years and with length of illness in most patients being >5 years. In 28 of the 30 patients, the illness was of a 60 progressive nature, and in 29 of the 30, relapses had been observed during the winter months. Group 2 constituted 30 patients with disseminated forms of psoriasis. Trial Protocols: Treatment B I: Traditional therapy in combination with L-Glu-L-Trp was administered to all patients in Group I: i.e., L-Glu-L-Trp was administered im at a dosage of 100 % in a volume of I mL with 0.25% novocaine every other day for Io days. Treatment B2: 5,807,830 79 Traditional therapy only was administered to the patients in Group 2: i.e., sedative desensitizers, vitamins A, B6, and B12, and folic acid, pyrogenic preparations, sedatives, UFO, and local prescription of salidol ointment and 3-5% sulfur salicylic and/or corticosteroid (salidol) ointments. Some 5 modifications of treatment regimens were required because of intolerance to B group vitamins in three cases which manifested itself in dermal puritus and urticarial eruptions. Laboratory parameters of disease activity were monitored including morning body temperature, leukocyte and differ- 1\u00b0 ential blood cell count, hematology measurements and blood chemistry, acute phase proteins, and immunology determi\u00ad nations including the percentages and absolute numbers of B- and T-lymphocytes. Comparisons were made to labora\u00ad tory values obtained from normal healthy persons aged 18 to :5 40 years. Clinical parameters of disease activity were monitored by grading derm al manifestations of disease as follows: \"improvement\" defined as stabilization of the dermal disease process and lightening and smoothing of papular, plaque, and rash eruptions; \"considerable improvement\" defined as indications of dermal locations having maculas, and/or solitary smooth papules having a pale color, or resembling \"maternal plaques,\" i.e., birth marks; and, \"recovery\" defined as indications of dermal locations having eruptions 25 or maculas that are depigmented or mildly pink in color. The findings of laboratory investigations are summarized in TABLES 30-32.80 were not pronounced. Slight changes were observed in patients treated with conventional therapy as follows: i) in positive reactions of clotting to ethanol (data not shown above), ii) a slower clotting time for recalcified plasma, and (iii) a slightly slower clotting time for kaolin-cephalin in d u c e d c lo ttin g (K C T ). F ib rin o p e p tid e (F D P ) concentration, (an indicator of the level of ongoing fibrin\u00ad olysis in patients), decreased insignificantly. Patients receiving L-Glu-L-Trp exhibited the following changes in coagulation measurements: i) clotting time for recalcified plasma was slowed, ii) KCT was also decreased, iii) thrombin time (Thrombotest; PTT) was decreased, iv) FDP concentration dropped significantly, v) antithrombin III (ATIII) decreased to normal levels, and vi) Hagemann- factor-dependent fibrinolytic activity was returned to normal 20 levels. Overall, the changes appeared to indicate a decrease in underlying thrombotic processes in the patients treated with L-Glu-L-Trp, possibly by activation of cellular fibrin\u00ad olytic activities, e.g., release of m ediators inducing Flagemann-factor-dependent fibrinolysis.

Acute Phase Reactants: Acute phase reactants ceruloplas\u00ad min and orosomucoid were significantly elevated, and pre\u00ad albumin was depressed, prior to treatment. Patients in Group 2 experienced a further increase in orosomucoid concentra- 20 tion during therapy, and other acute phase reactants, while not increasing significantly, did not drop significantly in this control group. In patients treated with L-Glu-L-Trp (Group I) ceruloplasmin, transferrin, and prealbumin increased sig\u00ad nificantly.decreased, yet did not reach normal. Thus, employing L-G lu-L-Trp in com bined therapy led to significant in c re a se s in p e rip h e ra l b lo o d ly m p h o c y te s and T-Iymphocytes in this psoriasis patient group. Clinical Responses: Both conventional and L-Glu-L-Trp treatments resulted in remission of disease activity by day 8-10 (TABLE 33) in approximately the same percentage of patients. Elowever, patients in Group I showed improvement more rapidly, i.e., with only the second injection of L-Glu- TABLE 32 Differential C ell Counts and Im m u n olosv Values IndexNorm al Healthy Values (n = 20)B efore Therapy (n = 40)Conventional Therapy Control (n = 30)Com bination L-Glu-L-Trp Therapy (n = 30) L (109% )1.7 g/m L) % Norm al Value: IgA (m g/m L) % Norm al Value: IgM (m g/m L) % Norm al Value:0 .46 0 .02 ) 7 ) ^Statistically different than the normal control values, i.e., p < 0.05; **, statistically different than the normal control values at the p < 0.001 level; f , statistically different than the pre-treatm ent valu es, i.e., p < 0.001. Cellular Immune Parameters: In the trial group of patients with psoriasis there was a slight increase in lymphocyte count and a significant (p<0.001) decrease in T- and B -lym phocytes. Serum im m unoglobulins w ere also 60 elevated, i.e., IgA, IgM, and to a lesser extent IgG. After L-G lu-L-Trp treatm ent, a considerable increase was observed in the number of leukocytes and lymphocytes. The quantity of T- and B-lymphocytes approached normal and the number of T-helper cells also increased. The number of 65 T-suppressors increased less dramatically. The levels of IgG and IgM after therapy remained unchanged, and IgAL-Trp there was noted an apparent pallor of psoriatic erup\u00ad tions as well as a gradual smoothing of eruptions. Overall, disease activity in the combination L-Glu-L-Trp-treated patients resolved 2-3 days earlier than in patients treated with only the conventional therapy, and this was most evident as i) a more rapid decrease in erythema of the skin eruptions (i.e., 2 .8 days sooner than controls), ii) a more rapid smoothing of papules and plaques, and iii) a more rapid disappearance of psoriatic rash (i.e., 7.1 days sooner than controls). The length of hospital stay for patients in Group I was also an average of 4.2 days shorter than patients 5,807,830 83 in Group 2. Clinical evaluation of patients' disease activity at day 8-10 is summarized in the following TABLE 33. TABLE 33 C linical Evaluation o f Patients R esponse to Therapy N um ber o f Patients H aving a C linical O utcom e as: Treatment No Considerable Group Im provem ent Im provem ent Im provem Protocol C: Wound Healing Summary Overview: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered to 37 patients with wounds of various origins, types and localiza\u00ad tions. Patients in the control group (24) received conven- 2s tional treatments. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered daily im (or topically) on each of 10 consecutive days. The im dose was 100 ,M g . L-Glu-L-Trp accelerated wound healing (in comparison to the controls), and L-Glu-L-Trp treatment reduced the duration of therapy and prevented development 30 of infectious complications. Protocol D: Burns Summary Overview: A total of 23 patients with cutaneous burns were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp either im or intrana- sally. Fourteen patients in a control group were treated using conventional methods. Individuals treated with L-Glu-L-Trp exhibited an accelerated rate of wound healing, a diminished frequency of infections, and less scarring was observed. 40 Protocol E: Frostbite Summary Overview: Seventeen patients with frostbite of the extremities were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp either im or intranasally. Eleven patients constituted a control group. Rapid healing and restoration of tissue integrity was observed in patients receiving L-Glu-L-Trp treatment. EXAMPLE 7 Obstetric and Gynecologic Diseases Protocol A: Pelvic Inflammatory Diseases Summary Overview: Ninety-six female patients (96) were entered into a trial having a variety of different disorders, 55 i.e., pelvic inflammatory diseases, cervicitis, vaginitis and various tubo-ovarian and adnexal abscesses. Forty-six patients (46) comprised the L-Glu-L-Trp treatment group, and 50 patients comprised a conventional treatment control group. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered daily im at a dose of 60 100 /rg, or I /rg/kg intranasally, on each of 5 consecutive days. Alternatively, 50 % of L-Glu-L-Trp was injected intralymphatically on each of 5 consecutive days in con\u00ad junction with conventional therapy. L-Glu-L-Trp treatment84 alleviated pain, reduced fever, and decreased the duration of the medical treatment in comparison with the control group receiving conventional treatment. Normalization of immune param eters was correlated with the observed clinical 5 improvements. Patient Populations: The patient population constituted 96 acutely ill patients (18 to 50 years of age): 46 were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp (Group I), and 50 were treated using conventional antibiotic therapy (Group 2). Patients entered 10 into Group I (aged 19-50) were separable into clinical subgroups as follows: Subgroup 1A, consisted of 18 patients exhibiting febrile endometriosis (body temperature 38\u00b0-39\u00b0 C.), and suppurative vaginal discharge after infected abor\u00ad tions performed outside hospitals (average age 24.4\u00b14.2 years); Subgroup IB , consisted of 16 patients with abdomi\u00ad nal pains resulting from chronic nonspecific subfebrile (<38\u00b0 C.) inflammatory disease of the fallopian tubes (average age 32.2\u00b13.9 years; range of abortions in the patient population 2-8); and, Subgroup IC consisted of 12 patients with inflammation of the fallopian tubes, (38% 20 resulting from placement of an IUD in the uterus more than 4 years previously). AU patients had previously proved unresponsive to a full course of broad spectrum antibiotic th e ra p y ( i.e ., m e tro n id a z o le , n itr o f u r a n s , and sulfanilamides) delivered on an in-patient basis (average age 34.5\u00b15.3 years). Group 2 (control) was constituted of 50 patients (aged 18-44) presenting with analogous symptoms and diseases and the patients in this group were treated with traditional antibiotic therapy. Treatment Protocols: In all cases L-Glu-L-Trp was deliv\u00ad ered im at a dose of 1 0 0 % in I ml volume daily on each of five days. Treatment A: Administered to patients in Group 1A: The course of L-Glu-L-Trp therapy was administered, remnants 35 of fetal tissue were surgically removed, and an additional course of L-Glu-L-Trp therapy was administered. Treatment B. Administered to patients in Group IB: L-Glu-L-Trp therapy was administered immediately upon admission into the protocol. Treatment C. Administered to patients in Group 1C: Infected uterine tissues were surgically removed, abdominal drainage was established, and L-Glu-L-Trp therapy was administered starting 2 days post-operatively. Laboratory Tests and Clinical Monitoring: Patients were 45 evaluated by monitoring the following parameters before, during, and 5 -7 days after therapy: i) clinical status of the patient (i.e., body temperature, abdominal pain, and physical examinations) and, ii) laboratory data (i.e., urinalysis, blood chemistry, and blood immunology). The following clinical 50 chemistry values of the patients in Groups 1A, IB , and IC were all within the normal range before and after treatment: AST, ALT, creatinine, urea, glucose, protein, chloride, potassium, and sodium. Patients in Groups IA -IC and Group 2 exhibited elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase (80\u00b113 ED/ml) and bilirubin (1.0\u00b10.05 mg %) prior to treatment, but the values were still within the normal range, i.e., normal alkaline phosphatase (30-85 ED/ml), and nor\u00ad mal bilirubin L-Glu-L-Trp reduced the latter serum markers, i.e., alkaline phosphatase fell to 62.71\u00b15.67 ED/mL and bilirubin to 0.50\u00b10.03 mg %. Laboratory immunology test results were not statistically different between Groups 1A, IB, and IC before or after receiving Treatment A, B, and C, respectively, so the data were pooled and presented together in TABLE 34. 85 TABLE 345,807,830 86 IndexIm m u n olosv Values Norm al Value Before (H ealthy) TherapyA A n 7 6 .4 4 \u00b1 1.52 74.1 \u00b1 1.68 7 1 .5 7 \u00b1 1.76 N o.

The results presented in TABLE 34, above, show that prior to therapy the patients in this trial population had decreased absolute levels of lymphocytes (49% of normal), decreased T-Iymphocytes (60% of normal), and decreased B-lymphocytes (35% of normal). On conventional therapy, the levels of all three monitors of immune function contin\u00ad ued to deteriorate. In patients treated with L-Glu-L-Trp, the levels of lymphocytes increased to about 81% of normal, with T- and B-lymphocytes increasing to about 75% and 45 55%, respectively. Protocol B: Complications of Pregnancy Summary Overview: One hundred fifty one patients (151) exhibiting toxemia in the first or second half of pregnancy 50 were treated with either L-Glu-L-Trp (97 patients) or with conventional therapy (54 patients). L-Glu-L-Trp was admin\u00ad istered im at 100 % daily, or I /rg/kg intranasally, for 5-10 days. L-Glu-L-Trp treatment normalized blood pressure, peripheral edema was reduced, abnormal blood chemistry values prior to treatment returned to within the normal range, and immune indices that were altered prior to treat\u00ad ment were returned to within the normal range. Protocol C Complications of Pregnancy Summary Overview: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered to 34 pregnant women, 27 pregnant women received conventional treatment served as a control group. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered daily at a dosage of 1 0 0 g im, or I g/kg intranasally, on each of 5-1 0 days. Signs of clinicalimprovement were resolution of weakness and dizziness, increased appetite, and the normalization of the immuno\u00ad logical and hematological indices. Decreased fetal hypoxia 40 was also observed in women treated with L-Glu-L-Trp. Protocol D: Post-Partem Infections Summary Overview: Nineteen patients (19 women) post\u00ad term were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp and 48 women received conventional post-term treatment as a control group. Admin\u00ad istration of 100 % L-Glu-L-Trp im (or I gfk.g intranasally), over a period of 3-5 days resulted in the effacement of the cervix with thinning of the cervix and the descent of the fetus, resulting in a normal delivery. Protocol E: Uterine Infections Summary Overview: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered in combination with antibiotic therapy to twelve female 55 patients (average age 34) with chronic uterine infections caused by placement of I.U.D.'s (i.e., mean length of infection 4-5 years; maximum 15 years). AU patients had received more than one previous course of antibiotic therapy during the course of their illness, and most patients had 60 received several courses of therapy. Conventional treatment consisted of surgical removal of the I.U.D. followed by a course of antibiotic therapy. The control group consisted of 50 patients with uterine infections, (same cause), treated using conventional therapy. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered 65 with conventional therapy by injecting 100 g im daily on each of five consecutive days. Differences between the symptoms of post-operative recovery of the patients in the 5,807,830 87 L-Glu-L-Trp treatment group (i.e., in comparison with the control group) were noted within as little as 3-4 days as increased appetite, and normalization of sleep and body temperature. Eleven of the 12 patients in the L-Glu-L-Trp treatment group healed more rapidly than the patients in the 5 control group and physical therapy was started sooner than with the patients in the control group. Intramuscular injec\u00ad tions of L-Glu-L-Trp did not induce any visible side effect or allergic reaction. EXAMPLE 8 Elerpes Virus Infections Protocol A: Herpes vulgaris Summary Overview: Patients treated with L-Glu-L-Trp either topically, im, or intranasally experienced marked reduction of recurrence of herpetic lesions, with substantial reduction in the period between outbreaks. In one trial, individuals who experienced 7-10 outbreaks per year expe- 20 rienced less than one outbreak per year after treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp in combination with interferon. Protocol B: Herpes Zoster Summary Overview: A total of 37 patients with Herpes Zoster were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp in combination with conventional interferon treatment. Twenty-five control patients (25) were treated with inter\u00ad feron alone. Administration of L-Glu-L-Trp was as a single 30 daily injection of 1 0 0 % im, or I /rg/kg intranasally, over a period of 10 days. Treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp resulted in accelerated clearing of foci of herpes infection. Recurrence of lesions was prevented and healing occurred on the average 40% earlier in the L-Glu-L-Trp treated group than 35 in the control group. Changes in immunological indices in the L-Glu-L-Trp treated patients were correlated with the favorable clinical outcome. EXAMPLE 9 Dental Diseases Protocol A: Gingivitis Summary Overview: Patients were treated for gingival 45 disease by subcutaneous administration of L-Glu-L-Trp into the area of the gingiva. The treatment resulted in an arrest of gingival disease. Approximately 160 patients were studied, 80 patients were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp and an equal number were treated using conventional therapy (control). 50 Administration of 100 % L-Glu-L-Trp im, subcutaneously, or by electrophoresis (whereby a small voltage charge to the gums results in a rapid transfer of medication through the gum epithelium) resulted in a more rapid arrest of bleeding, eliminated of inflammation, and decrease in purulent dis-88 charge. L-Glu-L-Trp treatment resulted in fewer recurrences of gingival disease. Normalization of immunologic indices and coagulation in the L-Glu-L-Trp treated patients was correlated with favorable clinical outcome. Protocol B: Dental Caries, Odontogenic Infections, Periapical Granulomas Summary Overview: Treatment of dental caries with toothpaste containing L-Glu-L-Trp may result in a reduction of caries. The use of dental toothpaste containing L-Glu-L- Trp may have the secondary effect of reducing incidence and severity of gingival disease. Patients with odontogenic infections and periapical granulomas can be treated with 1 0 0 % of L-Glu-L-Trp injected into the foramen at the base of the tooth, or alternatively, L-Glu-L-Trp can be compounded in a filling paste which is packed into the base of the tooth. Protocol C: Odontogenic with periapical granulomas limited, focal, and diffuse forms of purulent odontogenic osteomyelitis were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp. Twenty-eight patients (15) having 25 the same disease profile and under conventional treatment formed a control group. Patient Population: Forty-six children (aged 3-14 years; 29 boys and 17 girls) were entered into a combination L-Glu-L-Trp treatment group. The patients presented with the following diagnosed odontogenic infections: 18 with limited purulent infection(s), 7 with focal infection(s), 3 with diffuse infection(s). In addition, 3 patients presented with destructive osteomyelitis and 15 with plegmons man\u00ad dible. Fifteen children, with similar demographics and infec\u00ad tious odontogenic diseases, were entered into a control group treated with conventional antibiotic therapy. Treatment Protocol: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered im at 40 a dosage of 2 /rg/kg body mass daily for 3-7 days, depending upon the severity of the infection. Evaluations included X-ray, clinical chemistry and serum protein testing, and immunological testing. Laboratory Tests: Pre-treatment measurements were per\u00ad formed with peripheral blood samples collected from 2 0 of the 46 L-Glu-L-Trp treated children to establish baseline values Before Therapy). AU 15 children in the conventional treatment group were evaluated before therapy. Post\u00ad treatment measurements were performed with peripheral blood samples that were collected from all the conventional and L-Glu-L-Trp treated children. Fifteen healthy normal children were also evaluated to determine the normal mean values in the respective assays (Normal Healthy Control). The results of these determinations are summarized in TABLE 35.

The results in TABLE 35, show that prior to treatment the 25 patients in the trial population exhibited a statistically sig\u00ad nificant elevation in total peripheral blood leukocytes and a decrease in T-Iymphocytes (i.e., 50% and 56% of normal) but not in B-lymphocytes. Following L-Glu-L-Trp combi\u00ad nation therapy, T-Iymphocyte counts were increased to 98% of normal levels, while conventional therapy only increased the T-cell counts to about 61% of normal. Leukocyte counts decreased with both the conventional and L-Glu-L-Trp treatments. EXAMPLE 10 Lymphatic Infections L-Glu-L-Trp administered at a dosage of 100 % im, or I /rg/kg intranasally, or injected intralym phatically, is 40 expected to control the progression of lymphangitis. EXAMPLE U Ear/ Eye/ Nose and Throat Infections 45 Protocol A: Ophthalmic Diseases Summary Overview: Forty one patients (41; 17 men and 24 women; ranging in age from 17 to 6 8 years) with various eye diseases of infectious and non-infectious origin were 50 treated with L-Glu-L-Trp. Patients having the following infectious, and non-infectious, ophthalmic diseases were entered into the trial: a) keratitis, chronic uveitis, persistent chorioretinitis; b) retinal pigment dystrophy, Grenblad-Stranberg 55 syndrome, and maculophathy, respectively. Five patients were Class II invalids due to vision impairment, 4 were Class III, and 32 were impaired but not invalid. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered as an adjunct to ongoing conventional treatment with antibiotics, eye drops, anti-inflammatory 60 agents, and the like. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered daily in a single 0.1 mL (10 /rg) dose by the parabulbar route (Group I; n= 2 1), or alternatively one drop of the dipeptide solution (5 g) was delivered into the conjunctival cavity twice daily on each of 5 consecutive days (Group 2; n=20). Thirty six 65 patients undergoing conventional therapy served as a control group (Group 3; n=36).Clinical diagnoses of patients entered into Group I were as follows: 4 subjects had diagnosed adenoviral conjunc\u00ad tivitis; 2 subjects, recurring eyelid sties; 3 subjects, chronic serous-plastic uveitis; 3 subjects, central chorioretinitis; 5 subjects, central retinal dystrophy in both eyes; 4 subjects, 30 pigment degeneration of the retina. Clinical diagnoses of patients entered into Group 2 were as follows: namely, 7 subjects had diagnosed chronic serous- plastic uveitis, and 13 subjects adenoviral conjunctivitis. Vision was assessed using standard measurements: i.e., field of vision, visual acuity, electrophysiological indices. Ophthalmascopic examination was used to evaluate and score corneal epithelial integrity, extent of edema and infil\u00ad tration of the cornea (all strata), uveitis, retinal inflammation (edem a, fo cal and p erip h eral changes, exu d atio n , hemorrhage, plasmohemorrhagia), and expansion in the vitreous body. Immune parameters in peripheral blood were also assessed. Following treatment, the trial subjects were followed for not less than 1 2 months. Laboratory Effects: Treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp induced an increase in the number of circulating peripheral blood B- and T-lymphocytes, and in the numbers of CD4+- and CD 8+-lymphocytes. Lymphokine production (i.e., measured by LMIR in response to Con-A stimulation) was increased in all patients in Group I and 2 immediately following the 5 days of L-Glu-L-Trp treatment. Clinical Effects: Treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp resulted in a more rapid arresting of the inflammatory process and the increase in visual acuity, with a decrease being observed in the time over which medical treatment was required. No unfavorable response to therapy was observed. Group I: A \"marked favorable response\" to L-Glu-L-Trp therapy was observed (as described further below) in 9 patients (4 men; 5 women; 19-52 years of age) having the following diagnosed infectious adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis A \"good response\" to L-Glu-L-Trp therapy w as observed (as described further below) in 9 patients (4 men; 5 women; 17-68 years of age) having the II invalid vision disability); central retinal dystrophy (n= 8; including 2 Class II and I Class III invalids for vision disability). Group 2: A \"marked favorable response\" to L-Glu-L-Trp therapy was observed (as described further below) in 18 patients (8 men; 10 women; 20-70 years of age) having the following diagnosed eye diseases: namely, chronic serous- plastic uveitis (n = 6 including I invalid), and adenoviral conjunctivitis (n=12). A \"good response\" to L-Glu-L-Trp 20 therapy was observed (as described further below) in 2 patients (I man; I woman; 17 and 50 years of age, respectively) having the following diagnosed infectious eye diseases: namely, serous-plastic chronic response\" to 25 L-Glu-L-Trp therapy was observed in 3 patients with infec\u00ad tious eye diseases (2 men; I woman; 37-49 years of age) having the following diagnosed infectious eye diseases: central retinal dystrophy (n=l); pigment degeneration in the retina (n=2; including a class II and a class III invalid for 20 vision impairment). Group 3: As expected, since patients were selected based on their failure to respond to conventional therapy, response to conventional therapy varied between poor and nonexist\u00ad ent. 25 \"Marked responses\" to therapy with L-Glu-L-Trp in Groups I and 2 were manifested clinically in the following objective manner: patients with adenoviral conjunctivitis recovered faster (i.e., 10-13 days) than subjects in the 3 Q control group. Patients with chronic serous-plastic uveitis experienced: i) disappearance of new eruptions; ii) complete resolution of established foci; iii) a rise in visual acuity by >0.1; and, iv) no recurrence of disease activity in the > 1 2 month follow-up period. Patients with central chorioretinitis 3J (previously nonresponsive to conventional therapy) showed i) an increase in visual acuity; ii) increase in visual field and particularly acuity at the peripheral borders of the field; iii) disappearance of hemorrhagic foci, edema, and other mani\u00ad festations of inflammation in the fundus; iv) improvements 4 Q in eletrophysiological properties of the retina, i.e., values recorded in the electroophthalmogram (EOG) recording approached normal values and STK values also increased. \"Good responses\" to therapy with L-Glu-L-Trp in Groups I and 2 were manifested clinically in the following objective 45 manner: all patients with recurring eyelid sties were disease free up to 6 months. Patients with adenoviral conjunctivitis were disease free for up to 6 months, recurring disease activity was observed thereafter, but the relapse was shorter and milder than previous episodes in the patient. Patients with pigment degeneration of the retina and central retinal dystrophy exhibited: i) an increase in visual acuity in the range of 0.05 to 0.09; ii) a broadening of the peripheral visual field borders by up to 1 0\u00b0-meridians; iii) a decrease in the size of central scotomas; and, iv) improvements in electrophysiological indices (i.e., EOG values). \"Poor responses\" to therapy with L-Glu-L-Trp in Group I were manifested clinically in the following objective manner: patients with pigment degeneration of the retina and central retinal dystrophy exhibited i) a change in visual go acuity of less than 0.05; ii) an insignificant change in visual field; and, iii) no marked change in EOG values. Overall, a marked positive patient response was observed in 75% of patients with infectious eye diseases (e.g., aden\u00ad oviral keratoconjunctivitis, recurring introduction in 90% of92 the patients receiving L-Glu-L-Trp by instillation. A good response was obtained in 15% of patients following parab\u00ad ulbar introduction and 10% receiving L-Glu-L-Trp by instil\u00ad lation. In addition to the recorded changes in infectious and 5 chronic diseases, L-Glu-L-Trp therapy reduced the inci\u00ad dence of disease recurrence and of complications. L-Glu-L- Trp treatment was found effective in 66.7% of the subjects in this trial with infectious eye diseases. Protocol B: Ear Diseases L-Glu-L-Trp administered im or by the intranasal route can be used as an adjunctive therapy accompanying con\u00ad ventional antibiotic therapy. The latter route of L-Glu-L-Trp combination therapy will result in accelerated healing of chronic and acute ear infections. Protocol C: Corneal Diseases L-Glu-L-Trp administered im, intranasally, or intraocu- larly will stimulate regeneration of corneal epithelium and restoration of visual acuity with fewer infections and com\u00ad plications (e.g., scarring) than conventional therapy. EXAMPLE 12 Occupational Radiation Exposure Protocol A: Exposure to 100-200 R Summary Overview: A total of 263 patients and 18 control patients sustained exposure to 100-200 Roentgens of occupational radiation over a period of several weeks. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered im at a dosage of 100 % daily (or intranasally at I /rg/kg), for 10 days. Repeated courses of therapy were prescribed (about every 4 to 6 months) for all patients who exhibited periodic decreases in immunological indices. Following each treatment, L-Glu- L-Trp induced a restoration of normal, or near normal, peripheral blood immune indices in all patients and func\u00ad tional lymphocyte activity. Clinically, treatment resulted in an arrest of asthenic syndrome, an arrest of the somatic pathological exacerbations, and a reduction in opportunistic infections. Protocol B: Naval Specialists A clinical trial was conducted of 152 naval specialists (aged 2 0 ^ - 0 years) with evidence of occupational immuno\u00ad logic impairments resulting from their exposure to radiation and occupational toxins in the Kosomolets nuclear subma- 50 rine sinking off the coast of Finland. L-Glu-L-Trp was evaluated for its possible effects on cellular and/or humoral immunity. Approximately 87% of the servicemen entered into the trial had m oderate to sev erely im paired T-Iymphocyte functional activity, (i.e., evidenced by 55 decreased LMIR and blastogenesis w ith Con-A) and reduced neutrophil phagocytic activity (i.e., 30^-0% of normal). Immune parameters were determined before and after a routine 21-24 day rest period, during a normal rest/recuperation and training rotation. Servicemen were divided into two groups, the first (control) group received no treatment, and the second (experimental) group of 8 8 ser\u00ad vicemen received three consecutive daily intranasal doses of 100 meg L-Glu-L-Trp. L-G lu-L-Trp induced a pronounced increase in i) T-Iymphocyte function (i.e., measured by LMIR and blas- togenic response to mitogens); ii) the T-helper/T-suppressor ratio (i.e., T4/T8), which was normalized; and iii) the 5,807,830 93 granulocyte lysosomal cation proteins levels, which were also normalized. Complement C3 levels were also returned to within the normal range. There were no observed side- effects or indications of any intolerance. 5 EXAMPLE 13 Opportunistic Infections in Transplantation Summary Overview: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered to 17 patients receiving allogeneic skin grafts. 27 patients receiv\u00ad ing similar grafts and conventional care served as the control group. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered im as a single daily injection of 50-100 % on each of 5 consecutive days, or alternatively, intranasally at a dose of I /rg/kg daily for 5 15 days. Graft rejection was manifest in 8 of the control patients. L-Glu-L-Trp treatment prevented infectious com\u00ad plications and delayed graft rejection. EXAMPLE 14 Allergies Protocol A: Elay fever Summary Overview: Twenty nine patients (29) with vari\u00ad ous diagnosed allergies were treated on a daily basis for 5-7 days with L-Glu-L-Trp at a dose of I /rg/kg delivered im or by the intranasal route. Seventeen patients (17) in the control group received conventional therapy. Treatment with L-Glu- 30 L-Trp resulted in disappearance of allergic reactions. Protocol B: Drug Allergies Summary Overview: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered to 76 35 patients having clinical histories of allergies to antibiotics, during the period of administration of the antibiotic. A control group consisted of 43 patients with similar antibiotic drug allergies. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered im on a daily basis for 5-10 days at a dosage of 100 /rg, or alternatively, 40 intranasally at a dosage of I /rg/kg over the same 5-10 day period. L-Glu-L-Trp treatment prevented development of allergic reactions in the majority (i.e., 70%) of the patients, and in the remaining patients, the allergic disease course was 4J less severe. Allergic reactions were pronounced in the con\u00ad trol group with signs of drug intolerance. EXAMPLE 15 Transfusion Reactions Summary Overview: Seventy-six patients (76) requiring hemotransfusion therapy with allogeneic blood were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp in the post-operative period, starting at ^ day 4-6 post-op. Seventy-two patients (72) in a control group received conventional post-operative treatment. L-Glu-L-Trp treatment was administered as a single daily im dose of 100 % on each of 5 consecutive days, or alternatively, at a dose of I /rg/kg delivered on the same 60 schedule by the intranasal route. None of L-Glu-L-Trp treated patients showed clinical manifestations of allogeneic hemotransfusion reactions. In contrast, adverse reactions were observed in 17% of the control group.94 EXAMPLE 16 Orthopedic Diseases Protocol A: Fractures Summary Overview: L-Glu-L-Trp was applied to 44 patients with bone fractures of various origin. The control group comprised 28 patients. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered 10 intramuscularly or intranasally in a single dose of 1 0 0 % daily for 10 days. The use of L-Glu-L-Trp accelerated essentially (in comparison with the control group) the con\u00ad solidation of fractures, prevented the development of infec\u00ad tious complications, reduced pain syndrome and treatment duration. Protocol B: Chronic Osteomyelitis Summary Overview: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered to 20 176 patients with chronic osteomyelitis of various etiology and bone locations. The control group consisted of 88 patients receiving conventional treatment. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered im as a single daily dosage of 1 0 0 /rg, or 2 5 intranasally at a dose of I /rg/kg daily, over a period of 10 days. L-Glu-L-Trp treatment resulted in a pronounced posi\u00ad tive effect on clinical course that was expressed as a sig\u00ad nificant decrease in systemic toxicity and pain, disappear\u00ad ance of purulent inflammation, accelerated wound healing, decreased size of the areas of bone destruction, and decreased incidence of clinical relapse. Protocol C: Acute Osteomyelitis Trial Population: Seventeen hospitalized children (10 boys and 7 girls) were entered into this protocol: 6 with acute inflammatory diseases of soft tissues (abscesses, phlegmons), 4 with odotogenous osteomyelitis of the jaw, and 7 with hematogenous osteomyelitis of the flat and tubular bones. In 11 children, the course of the illness was acute and in 6 it was subacute and chronic. Treatment Protocol: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered in combination therapy with conventional antibiotic therapies. Where necessary, surgery was performed to drain infectious foci in the jaw or soft tissues, affected teeth were extracted, and for osteomyelitis a port was drilled for infusion of antibiotics. Physical examination and laboratory testing was 5 0 conducted before administering L-Glu-L-Trp and 2-3 days after the treatment. Laboratory tests were conducted to determine clinical chemistry and protein values prior to and after therapy (i.e., including the concentrations of bilirubin, creatinine, albumin, cholesterol, urea nitrogen, glucose, protein, chloride, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, alkaline p h o sp h a ta se , Ci 1-O rosom ucoid, a 2-m a u lin , prealbumin, ceruloplasmin, and transferrin). While urea nitrogen and cholesterol decreased slightly after therapy, these and all other changes observed after L-Glu-L-Trp treatment were not statistically significant. The results of differential cell counts and testing of immune parameters are summarized in TABLE 36. 95 TABLE 365,807,830 96 Im m u n olosv 1.6 \u00b1 0.3 % o f PBL: 30.8 \u00b1 4 .94 18.7 \u00b1 4 N o.

The results presented in TABLE 36 show that prior to treatment the patients in the trial population had decreased 30 levels of B- and T-Iymphocyte mitogen responsiveness to PHA and Con-A, (i.e, as measured by cytokine production in LMIR assay). Prior to treatment, the patients also showed possible decreases in the percentages of T-helper lympho\u00ad cytes and increases in T-suppressor lymphocytes, i.e., 5 determined using L-Glu-L-Trp the following changes were observed: i) leukocyte counts and 4 Q neutrophil counts dropped significantly; ii) Null lymphocyte counts dropped; and, iii) B-Iymphocyte counts and serum IgM levels dropped significantly. While not statistically significant, lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood increased with T-helper rising and T-suppressor percent falling. T-Iymphocyte function increased as measured by cytokine production in vitro in the LMIR assay in response to PHA and Con-A mitogens and staphylococcal and streptococcal antigens. Clinical Response: Children in the treatment group reported feeling better, and according to the report of the 50 attending physician \"wounds cleaned themselves of necrotic tissue and developed granulation tissue 2-3 days earlier than usual.\" Protocol D: Acute Osteomyelitis In 29 adolescents with osteomyelitis, 2 /rg/kg L-Glu-L- Trp was administered im daily on each of 3 -7 consecutive days, depending upon the severity of the infection. The control group consisted of 13 children who received con\u00ad ventional therapy with antibiotics. Clinical improvement was noted in the 3 days following L-Glu-L-Trp treatment with an arrest in the inflammatory process, a reduction in pain, and an increased stability of the underlying dental structures as evidenced by X-ray studies. Fevers reportedly resolved on the average 1-2 days sooner in the L-Glu-L-Trp 65 treated group, and all wounds and purulent discharge were observed to close with healing 2-3 days earlier than childrenthe control group. In only I child (i.e., having purulent osteomyelitis), out of the 29 L-Glu-L-Trp-treated, did the wounds failed to heal (i.e., a 3% failure rate), as compared with failure in 2 of the 13 children in the control group (i.e., a 15% failure rate). Clinical improvements in the L-Glu-L- Trp treated children were accompanied by decreases in the total leukocyte counts, and the T-cell counts nearly doubled. EXAMPLE 17 Kidney and Prostate Diseases Protocol A Pyelonephritis in Pregnancy Summary Overview: Twenty-seven pregnant female 45 patients (27) with pyelonephritis were treated with L-Glu- L-Trp as a single daily dose of 100 % on each of 5-10 consecutive days and in combination with ongoing conven\u00ad tional therapy. A control group was constituted of 19 control patients with pyelonephritis receiving the conventional therapy. Treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp resulted in reduction of fever, the normalization of urinary output, and overall clinical improvement with resolution of infection. Women treated with L-Glu-L-Trp experienced normal delivery with\u00ad out complications. 55 Protocol B Prostatitis Trial Population: Thirty four patients (aged 22 to 45 years) with chronic prostatitis were entered into Group I of 60 this trial during the acute phase of their disease. Diagnosis was based on medical history, and physical examination of the prostate (palpated through the rectum). Laboratory test\u00ad ing included microscopic examination of prostate gland secretions, spermography and urinalysis. AU patients had previously received full courses of unsuccessful therapy with antibacterial agents, and additional individualized therapy including uroantiseptics, spasmolytic, ganglion 5,807,830 97 98 blockers, novocain paraprostate and presacral blocks, ultrasound, and prostate gland massage. Success of any individualized therapy was only partial and short-term. A control group (Group 2) constituted 14 patients (aged 23^-5), also having chronic prostatitis, and enrolled during 5 the active phase of the patients' disease. AU patients in the control group had also failed previously one or more full courses of antibiotic and conventional therapy. Treatment Protocol: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered im daily at 100 /rg/dose for 5 days (500 % total treatment io course) in combination with conventional individualized therapy including antibacterial preparations and uroantisep- tics (e.g., oletrin, and bisepton), physical procedures (e.g., ultrasound; using a Sterzhen I instrument), prostate gland massage, and exercise. 15 Patients in Group 2 received only conventional therapy with antibacterial agents and individualized treatments, (i.e., as above). Laboratory Tests Peripheral blood samples were collected for laboratory testing 1 0 days after the last injection of 20 L-Glu-L-Trp. The results of the laboratory testing for immune parameters are presented in TABLE 37.

The results presented in TABLE 38, above, show that treatment of the patients in Group I with L-Glu-L-Trp i) did not significantly alter immune values in patients that had \"normal\" pre-treatment values; ii) significantly increased B-lymphocytes, phagocytes, and complement lev\u00ad els in patients that had \"decreased\" pre-treatment values; and, iii) significantly decreased B-lymphocytes and immune complex levels in patients that had \"increased\" pre\u00ad treatment values. The same analysis was conducted using the data collected following conventional therapy of the patients in Group 2, and none of the differences were statistically significant. Clinical Results: Clinical results were recorded according to accepted criteria for evaluating the efficacy of treatments for prostatitis: namely, i) disappearance of painful symptoms over a period of 1-1.5 months (e.g., absence of pain in perineum, sacrum, and scrotum); ii) size and elasticity of the prostate on physical examination; iii) volume of prostate gland secretions and ejaculate; iv) of urine; and, vi) overall patient health. A \"good\" result was scored if labo\u00ad ratory values were normalized and the patient remained pain free during the 1-1.5 month follow-up period of examina\u00ad tion. A \"satisfactory\" result was scored if laboratory values were normalized even if some pain remained. An \"unsatis\u00ad factory\" result was scored if laboratory values remained unchanged and pain persisted. A \"good\" result was recorded in 26 patients (76.5%) in Group I following L-Glu-L-Trp treatment. After finishing the treatment course, patients noticed significant improve\u00ad ment in general physical condition with disappearance of painful symptoms and dysuria. AU the laboratory indicia returned to within the normal range of values. A \"satisfac\u00ad tory\" result was recorded in the remaining 8 patients in Group I (23.5%). No \"unsatisfactory\" results were recorded with the patients in Group I. In contrast, following conventional treatment, the patient responses in Group 2 were scored as follows: 9 \"good\" (64.3% ); 3 sa tisfa (21.4% and, 2 (14.3% ) unsatisfactory, EXAMPLE 18 Clinical Studies: Leprosy Overview: A total of 45 patients with leprosy (Elansen's disease) were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp administered im 65 daily at a dose of 1 0 0 pg, or intranasally daily at a dose of I /rg/kg, on each of 5 consecutive days as an adjunct toongoing conventional therapy. Twenty-seven other M. lep\u00ad rae infected individuals constituted the control group. The patients studied had previously documented antibiotic resis- 20 tance to treatment by conventional methods. L-Glu-L-Trp treatment resulted in i) resolution of dermal leprotic lesions, ii) lower incidence of recurrence of dermal disease, and iii) accelerated healing of individual dermal ulcers. Infection with M. leprae is well recognized to result in 25 immunosuppression. The immune indices in the peripheral blood of L-Glu-L-Trp treated patients were normalized, and certain patients acquired skin test responsiveness to lep\u00ad romin antigen. Background: Infection with Mycobacterium leprae gen- 30 erally proceeds in a slow inexorable and progressively debilitating manner through stages of tuberculoid leprosy to lepromatous leprosy and eventual death. The disease pro\u00ad gression is gradual from non-differentiated leprosy (J) to borderline tuberculoid (BT) to polar tuberculoid (TT) to 35 borderline (BB) to borderline lepromatous (BL) to polar lepromatous (Lip). The lepromatous stage of the disease is further subdivided into subpolar lepromatous (Lis). Histo\u00ad logical features of acid fast bacteria in tissues, perivascular granulomas in skin and mucous membranes are well 40 established, as are the general immune suppression evident as the absence of a delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reac\u00ad tion to lepromin antigen, decreased blast transformation of peripheral blood lymphocytes to PHA, an altered ratio of CD4+/CD8+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood, and decreased 45 levels of IgM and IgG in serum. The therapy of choice most commonly employs several anti-leprotic preparations in optimally-tolerated doses, e.g., diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS) taken internally at a dose of about 50 mg and sodium sulfone taken intramuscularly using a 50% sterile injection 50 solution. The minimal time frame for therapy of TT leprosy is 3 years; for non-differentiated leprosy 5 -7 years; and, for LL leprosy, patients must receive treatment over their entire lives. Treatment courses are commonly 6 months with an intermission of 1-1.5 months between courses, and to pre- 55 vent the development of drug resistant bacteria, the drug preparation is preferably changed to a new drug (e.g., Rifam picin, ethionam ide, prothionam ide or Lampren- clofaximine) after each course of therapy. Trial Protocol: An assessment was made of disease pro- 60 gression prior to and after combination therapy involving physical examination of the skin, biochemical testing of blood and urine, bacteriologic testing of skin plaques, immu\u00ad nological tests of cellular and humoral immunity, and his\u00ad tologic and electron microscopic examination of cutaneous skin lesions. Patient Population: Efficacy of L-Glu-L-Trp in combined antibiotic therapy was evaluated in 45 patients (aged 18 to 5,807,830 101 102 83; 23 men and 22 women) with chronic debilitating infec\u00ad tion with Mycobacterium leprae, i.e., Hansen's disease (the length of illness varied from 2 to 25 years). According to standard diagnostic criteria at clinical presentation: 18 patients bad active leprosy; and in 27 the disease was regressive. Sixteen of the patients with active leprosy also presented with neurotrophic ulcers (NTU) and chronic osteomyelitis. According to the Ridley-Jopling diagnostic classification criteria, 37 patients were suffering from lep\u00ad romatous leprosy, 6 from borderline-lepromatous leprosy, and 2 from borderline tuberculous leprosy. The length of disease in this patient population was 2 to 25 years. None of the patients in the trial had received previous treatment with an immunomodulator, and all were receiving conventional courses of sulfone-type antibiotic therapy and experiencing prolonged slow-disease progression. L-Glu-L-Trp Treatment: The 18 patients with active lep\u00ad rosy were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp administered im at a dosage of I pg once daily in about I mL for 5 days. In 10 of the patients with the regressive course of disease, the L-Glu-L-Trp was administered daily intranasally by drops at a dosage of I pg daily for 5 days (i.e., one treatment course). Four of the 16 patients with active leprosy and NTU were treated with additional localized intra-ulcer injections of about 1-20 /rg/site L-Glu-L-Trp. While L-Glu-L-Trp was being administered, antibiotic therapy was discontinued.

The observed increase in mitogen-induced blast responsiveness of lymphocytes in the leprosy patients after 55 5-7 days of L-Glu-L-Trp treatment was accomplished w ith\u00ad out a major bulk change in either the number or subpopu\u00ad lation composition of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes. Summary of Histological Findings: Three indices were used to score serial sections of biopsy samples obtained 60 from patients before and after treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp, namely, i) bacterial index (BI), i.e., the relative saturation of the tissue with mycobacterial bacilli in tissue sections on a scale of 0 (low) to I (high); ii) histologic index (HI), i.e., scoring the area of granuloma and bacteria (Materials and 65 Methods, below); and, iii) esterase index (El), scoring the differentiative state of the granuloma (M aterials and Methods, below). The results of these studies with patientsSummary of Immunological Studies: Parameters of cel\u00ad lular and humoral immunity were tested 5-7 days after concluding one treatment course in the 16 patients with active leprosy. Nonspecific immunosuppression of M. lep\u00ad rae infection was evident in the patient population prior to initiating therapy with only about 13-15% of patient lym\u00ad phocytes capable of milogen-induced blast transformation (TABLE 38). This contrasted with 40-60% blast cells in normal subjects following culture with PHA (polyvalent mitogen), or 20-40% blast cells with Con-A (T-ce 1 1 mitogen; TABLE 39; control). After the 5-7 day course of L-Glu-L- Trp treatment, blast responsiveness of patient lymphocytes was increased 1.8-fold to PHA and 1.6-fold to Con-A, and after 6 months (and several treatment courses), responsive\u00ad ness to Con-A was in the normal range (i.e., 20-40% of lymphocytes responsive).TABLE 39 Percentage o f Peripheral B lood Lym phocytes R esponsiveness to P H A and Con A Treatment PH A ( \u00b0 7 c f C on -A (%)a Before L-Glu-L-Trp 1 5.2 \u00b1 4.5 13.9 \u00b1 2.9 5 - 7 days 2 8 .7 \u00b1 3.8 22.5 \u00b1 4.0 6 months 2 2.3 \u00b1 1.43 36.9 \u00b1 1.28 N on e- healthy controls 4 0 -6 0 * 20^10* a-M ean % resp onsive P B L (blast cells); patient values + /- S .D .

The histologic findings also suggested a trend toward a higher level of macrophage activation and greater differentiated state of the existing 50 granulomata in the tissues. The latter findings are highly suggestive of increased bactericidal activity in the residual granulomas. Consistent with this interpretation was a gen\u00ad eral improvement in the gross pathology of the skin in the treated patient population when compared with the pretreat- 55 ment pathology. Dramatically, in the patients with disease in regression (i.e., LLc ) what was before treatment a homo\u00ad geneous mycobacterial infection virtually disappeared after therapy with a decrease in the area of granulomas and an increase in the number of lymphocytes, mononuclear cells, 60 fibroblasts, mast cells, histiocytes, fibroblasts and fat cells in the skin. In patients with active disease (i.e., LLs), the number of macrophages containing bacilli was greatly reduced and the number of lymphoid cells, histiocytes and fibroblasts increased. Histological measurements performed 65 at 3 months were striking, with signs of disease regression in all patients in the trial as evidenced by decreased recog-electron microscopic examination confirmed degenerative changes in the residual bacteria in patients' tissues, as evidenced by an increase in fat content in the cytoplasm of the bacilli, an increase in fuchsinophilic granules in tissues (degenerative mycobacterial bodies), and an increase in degenerative forms of leprous bacilli and cell wall materials visible in phagolysosomes of tissue macrophages and his\u00ad tiocytes. Signs of tissue would healing were also evident as neovascularization of tissues at the former granuloma sites. By six months (the time at which potential efficacy of a leprosy drug is normally assessed) histologic signs of a granulomatous response were waning with very few bacteria being evident, and decreased tissue infiltrate of immune cells. The results indicated that introduction of L-Glu-L-Trp into the treatment plan for M. leprae greatly accelerated the resolution of skin lesions in all patients in the trial group. Dramatically, four subjects with negative skin tests for lepromin at the beginning of therapy turned positive. Other clinical evidences of success are disclosed below. Summary of Clinical Results: Six to seven days after the completion of a single course of L-Glu-L-Trp therapy, no visible changes were clinically evident. However, after I month of therapy, the first clinical effects became evident as 5,807,830 105 decreased sizes of measured cutaneous lesions in the 6 patients with borderline lepromatous leprosy and the 2 patients with borderline tuberculous leprosy, although the clinical effects varied from patient to patient. No change was noted in the patients with progressive lepromatous leprosy, 5 but some improvements in cutaneous lesions were noted in a few of the patients with static lepromatous leprosy. After three months of treatment pronounced signs of dermal improvement were clinically evident in responsive patients, i.e., lepromatous papules, plaques, lepromas, and 10 infiltrates were decreased. After 6 months of treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp, cutaneous lesions were nearly completely absent from responsive patients, and the size of the remaining leprous plaques was 15 greatly decreased in size with lucid zones of scar tissue forming about the periphery of the plaques. In some patients leprous plaques were completely absent and replaced by atrophic maculas having a burgundy-like color. Remarkably, one patient previously classified as borderline lepromatous leprosy was down-graded to borderline tuberculous leprosy with nearly a 1 0 0% reduction in histological evidence of infection, and complete histological disappearance of cuta\u00ad neous M. leprae. A second patient, previously classified with tuberculous leprosy showed a complete cessation of leprous infection and was discharged to out-patient care. At 6 to 12 months, two additional patients classified at the beginning of the trial with lepromatous leprosy and border\u00ad line leprosy were released to out-patient ambulatory care, with cutaneous and histological evidence of their disease completely absent. In one case a perivascular lepromatous granuloma evident by gross pathology at the beginning of treatment was histologically examined and seen to be resolved to a diffuse lympho-histiocytic infiltrate completely devoid of mycobacteria. Histological examination of biopsy samples from skin (and nasal mucous membranes) and taken from the locations of previous lesions all revealed a com\u00ad plete absence of mycobacteria or perivascular leprous granulomata, and instead, there was evidence of diffuse infiltration w ith sm all lym phocytes and histiocytes (dendritic and Langerhans cells). Within the treatment subgroup of 16 patients who had neurotrophic ulcers at the beginning of the trial (NTU; above), 4 patients initially had presented with primary disease, 9 with recurrent NTU, and 3 with chronic oscheal osteomyelitis of the lower extremities complicated with NTU. At the beginning of therapy, the ulcerative lesions were filled with purulent-necrotic material and no evidence of wound healing was present. Fifteen of the 16 patients showed clinical im provem ents while on L-Glu-L-Trp therapy. For primary NTU, the clinical improvements were obtained after about 3-6 weeks of L-Glu-L-Trp treatment, i.e., with secretions from the ulcer disappearing; for recur\u00ad rent NTU the improvements were obtained at about 4-6 weeks (in both cases, the results obtained were dependent on the size of the ulcers). The ulcers were replaced for the most part by a dried crusty scab, and eventually a callous. At about the same time chronic osteomyelitis of the lower extremities was healed in the three patients so afflicted. Cytological examination of smears taken from the ulcers during treatment revealed a decrease in acid fast bacteria in the exudates, and after only one week of therapy, activated106 lymphocytes, monocytes, and neutrophils were observed in the exudates (TABLE 42). H istologic evidence of re-epithelialization of the ulcers was evident after only two weeks of L-Glu-L-Trp therapy.

In patient #16, chronic osteomyelitis was not improved. Healing times for NTU in the treated patients were about 3-6 weeks for primary NTU (depending upon size), and about 4-6 weeks for secondary recurrent lesions. The measured rate of healing for primary NTU (from planimetry) was 6.34 mm 2/day, and for recurrent NTU the rate was 5.91 mm 2/day. The area of ulceration decreased over the first week of treatment by a mean value of 40% in patients with primary NTU, and by 22.6% in those 35 with recurrent ulcers. By the end of the second week the additional decrease in area of ulceration was 22% and 29%, respectively; and, by the third week 23.2% and 8.2%. While the trial was terminated at 6 months, at twelve months, four patients (3 with LL and I with BL) who received repeat courses of L-Glu-L-Trp over the period from 6 - 1 2 months continued to be observed and their condition continued to improve with further regression of the cutane\u00ad ous lesions clinically and histologically (i.e., with dermal 45 atrophy, re-epithelialization, and stable regression of disease). Four other patients (3 with LLs and I with BL) who did not receive follow-up treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp showed a worsening of disease from the 6 month to the I year observation with new papules and macules apparent in the skin, and new perivascular granulomas evident histo\u00ad logically. The HI and EI values for these patients showed deterioration from the 6 month values. On long-term follow up, one of the four ambulatory 55 patients experienced a relapse of disease, but as a borderline tuberculoid form of leprosy (not lepromatous) and at three weeks after termination of the L-Glu-L-Trp trial. Both parenteral (im) and intranasal (drops) administration appear effective. In certain patients nasal stuffiness was 60 encountered with visible nasal edema, and adminis\u00ad tration was discontinued. Materials and Methods: Patient Examination: Examinations were conducted before treatment, and at time intervals of: i) 5 -7 days after 65 the L-Glu-L-Trp treatment, ii) I month, iii) 3 months, iv) 6 months, and v) 12 months. Methods for skin examination included general observation, morphometry and planimetry 5,807,830 107 to quantify the size of leprotic lesions (as well as infiltrates, macules, and lepromas). Patient blood samples (obtained at the latter observation points) were tested (using standard methods) to determine total protein, creatinine, urea, and hepatic function (i.e., bilirubin, thymol, sulem, and 5 AST and ALT transaminases). W hen appropriate, urinalysis was also conducted. Indices of Cellular Immunity: Functional activity of T-Iymphocytes was determined by microscopically assess\u00ad ing blast transformation of peripheral blood lymphocytes, to i.e., p repared by F ico ll-U ro Lym\u00ad phocytes capable of blast transformation with PF1A, Con A, or synthetic M. leprae antigen were counted microscopically after 36-48 hrs. in vitro culture. Lymphocyte subpopulations 15 were determined by immunofluorescence microscopy using OKT-specific monoclonal antibodies (Ortho, Piscataway, N.J.) and FITC-Iabeled swine and mouse Ig. Indices of Humoral Immunity: Humoral immunity to M. leprae was determined by testing for the presence of IgG or 20 IgM in the patient serum using the immunofluorescence agglutination (IFA) method. Briefly, patient antibodies capable of cross-linking bacilli can induce agglutination and after washing the bound antibodies can be visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy using FITC-Iabeled anti- 25 human IgG or IgM. Antibodies to M. leprae were also assessed using indirect hemagglutination (of bacilli), radial immunodiffusion in agarose using cryostat sec\u00ad tions or paraffin sections of formalin-fixed punch biopsy samples (Ix0.5x0.5 cm) using Sudan III staining to reveal neutral lipids, hematoxylin and eosin to visualize immune 35 cells, and Sil-Nilssen acid fast staining to reveal M. leprae bacilli. Non-specific acid esterase was determined by fixing biopsy samples with calcium formol (per Becker's method) and to of Gomori's method. An ocular micrometer was used to 40 measure (in serial sections) the area occupied by leporato- mous lesions, as well as the size of the cellular infiltrate. A scale from 1+ to 6+ was used to score the extent of the tissue section that was saturated with mycobacteria, referred to as the bacterial index (BI). Staging of granulomatous lesions 45 was according to Ridley and Jopling: i.e., the histological index (HI)=X+BIG, where X is the decimal logarithm of the granulomatous areas measured in 5-6 serial sections, and BIG is the mean bacterial index of the 5-6 serial sections. Non-specific acid esterase was used to identify activated macrophages in granulomas in tissue sections and the inten\u00ad sity of the reaction in the epidermis was used to score the stage of the leprous infection: i.e., an esterase index value <1.0 corresponded to a highly active poorly differentiated leprotic process; >1.0 to a more granulomatous (developed) 55 mass in the tissue section. Electron microscopy was con\u00ad ducted on ultra-thin sections from seven selected patients before and after treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp. Biopsy tissues were fixed in glutaraldehyde and osmium, dehydrated in ethanol and propylene oxide, and embedded in epoxide 60 resin. Leprous infection in skin lesions was assessed using wound exudates. Exudates were collected from the moist surface of ulcerative defects, smears on slides were fixed with methanol and stained with azure-eosin according to the method of Romanovsky-Giemsa. Neutrophil activity was 65 histochemically identified using Overview: Fifty-four patients (54) with relaps\u00ad ing forms of tropical malaria were entered into the trial. The patients' symptoms ranged from moderate to severe. Thirty- three patients (33) were entered into the L-Glu-L-Trp treat\u00ad ment group and 21 patients into a control group. L-Glu-L- Trp was administered as a single daily im injection at a dose of 100 pg, or alternatively, in at I pgfkg body weight, on each of 5-10 consecutive days. The treatment resulted in a reduction of the patients' hepatolineal syndrome, a normal\u00ad ization of hematological and immunological indices, a reduction of fever, and a decreased incidence of disease relapses in the treated subjects relative to the controls. The clinical investigators report as follows: \"A commission consisting of Asst. Chief of the 175th MH,\" (Medical Hospital; name omitted) \"and the Chief of the Infection Dept, of the 175th M H ,\" (nam e om itted) \" and the physicians,\" (two names omitted) \"confirms that L-Glu-L- Trp use (sic) in combination with basic therapy for treating patients with tropical malaria in recurring form with a moderate or severe degree of severity hinders the develop\u00ad ment of early (over the course of 28 days) relapses of disease, and makes for a decrease (normalization) of the measurements of liver and spleen, as well as an elevation (norm alization of the num ber of leukocytes).\" The hematological, immunologic, and clinical chemistry values recorded in these studies are summarized in TABLES 30 43-44.

While L-Glu-L-Trp treatment did not alter coagulation values, the levels of FDP decreased and ATIII increased, suggesting an effect on the underlying thrombotic processes in these patients. (These findings are similar to those pre\u00ad sented in Examples 4 and 6, above.) The levels of the following acute phase reactant proteins were evaluated in the trial subjects before and after L-Glu- 5,807,830 109 L-Trp, or control, treatment and comparisons were made to the levels in normal healthy subjects: complement C3, p r e a l b u m i n , c e r u l o p l a s m i n , o r o s o m u c o i d , a2-macroglobulin, and transferrin. The results showed that the patients in the trial population exhibited no elevation in 5 acute phase reactants prior to treatment, and after L-Glu-L- Trp (or control) treatments no statistically significant change in these parameters was observed.

The investigators also observed that L-Glu-L-Trp treated patients experienced a reduction in muscle and bone pain. Immunological indices in peripheral blood were also normalized. Patient Population: Forty nine patients (20-30 years of 1 Q age; Kinh nationality) with diagnosed Dengue Fever were entered into the trial. The patients were referred to the 175th Military Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City at the time of an epidemic of Dengue fever in the (then) South Soviet Repub\u00ad lic of Vietnam. Diagnosis was based on the criteria recom- 15 mended by the World Health Organization (1986) using medical histories, and clinical and laboratory data. Serologi\u00ad cal analyses were conducted at the Arbovirus Infectious Diseases Laboratory of the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City. AU patients had a first or second degree disease severity. Clinical indicia of disease activity included: fever, chills, headache (98.3% of patients), dizziness (95%), weak\u00ad ness (100%), loss of appetite (95%), sleep disturbance (90%), sensations of and lip consti- catarrh in the nasopharynx with cough (35%), hyperemic facial tissue with pain in the superior ocular orbit (58.6% ), inflammation in scleral vessels (55.2%), light sensitivity (32.2%), and muffled heart tones (86.7%) or a functional auscultated on vom iting were rarely encountered (15% and 11.7%, respectively). Joint and muscle pains were pronounced, most commonly involving the spinal joints in the lumbar region 35 (96.6%), joints of the pelvic girdle (82.2%), the ulnar joints (53.4%), as well as, the muscles of the lumbar (69%) abdominal regions (69%). Exanthema (40.7%) were evident in patients. Dermal puritus with rash was seldom observed (6.1%), but 40 hepatomegaly (65.5%) and splenomegaly (53.4%) were pronounced, as were leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and changes in blood coagulation time (during periods of hem\u00ad orrhaging induced by the virus). Leukocytes during peak episodes of disease were recorded to be 4.60\u00b10.17xl09/L, and the absolute number of lymphocytes varied widely from 0.95 to 4.29xl09/L. Patients were divided into two groups: Group I; consist\u00ad ing of 28 patients (\"Control\") treated only with conventional maintenance therapy; and, Group 2, consisting of 21 patients treated with L-Glu-L-Trp in combination with conventional maintenance therapy. Hemorrhagic Dengue Fever Protocol A Summary Overview: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered to 21 patients with hemorrhagic Dengue Fever, and 28 patients receiving conventional therapy served as controls. L-Glu- L-Trp was administered im single daily doses of 100 % on each of 5 consecutive days as an adjunct to ongoing con\u00ad ventional therapy. Treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp resulted in decrease in fever, reduction of toxic symptoms (i.e., chills,Treatment Regimens: Group I received conventional maintenance therapy consisting of detoxifying preparations g0 and methods, e.g., fluids, fever control agents and the like. Group 2 received combination therapy, i.e., maintenance therapy and L-Glu-L-Trp, but only during periods of acute disease activity. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered at a dosage of 500 %. The efficacy of the respective treatment protocols 65 was evaluated by recording the most frequently used clinical indicia of Dengue disease activity: namely, the clinical indicia recorded in TABLE 45.

In most patients, the day 30 after initiating L-Glu-L-Trp therapy, body temperature became normal, and those patients who did not normalize on the first day normalized on day 2. A direct correlation was noted between the length of fever and the disease free interval following fever. L-Glu-L-Trp treatment appeared to in crease the absolute num bers o f leu k o cy tes and T-lymphocytes. No side effects or allergic effects were observed during L-Glu-L-Trp treatment. L-Glu-L-Trp treat\u00ad ment led to a more rapid convalescence and restoration of the subjects' ability to perform work. Protocol B Summary Overview: Sixty Dengue virus infected patients (60) were entered into the trial; 36 were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp and 24 were treated using conventional therapy 45 (i.e., controls). Administration of L-Glu-L-Trp at a dosage of 100 % im, or alternatively I /rg/kg in, on each of 5-10 consecutive days resulted in the reduction of fever, more rapid reduction of toxic symptoms (e.g., chills, fever, rash, headaches, muscle aches and pains) and the restoration of immunologic indices.EXAMPLE 21 Infectious Disease: Tuberculosis Early Results: Sixty-three patients having pulmonary 5 infection w ith M ycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) were entered into the trial: 37 patients were treated with L-Glu- L-Trp and 26 patients (controls) were treated using conven\u00ad tional treatments. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered five times at a dosage of 50 % to 100 % every other day and as an 10 adjunct to treatments with conventional antibiotics. Clinical evaluation of the patients at 2 months post-treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp revealed a disappearance of toxic symptoms, a resorption of pulmonary infiltrates, and a resolution of pulmonary cavities. The disappearance of TB bacilli was 35 noted in the sputum. Prior to treatment, immune parameters in peripheral blood were abnormal, i.e., decreased, and following treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp these parameters were normalized. Expanded Results: One hundred and five patients (105) 20 were entered into the trial. The patients, aged 19 to 60 years, consisted of 73 men and 32 women who were presenting for the first time with active progressive pulmonary TB infec\u00ad tion. AU patients in the trial had been hospitalized because of the severity of their disease. According to standard diagnostic criteria at clinical presentation: 59 patients had signs of pulmonary infiltration; 11 showed evidence of disseminated lung disease; 1 0 exhibited at least one fibrous/ cavernous foci of infection; 9 showed at least one cavernous foci; and 16 had tuberculomas. The 105 patients were divided into three groups as follows: namely, Group I, 37 patients, treated with conventional therapy and L-Glu-L-Trp (i.e., 5 -1 0 0 % daily for 5 days); Group 2,22 patients, treated w ith conventional therapy and the im munom odulator \"decaris\" (i.e., 150 %, twice weekly, for 1.5-2 months); and, Group 3, consisted of 46 patients, who received only con- 35 ventional therapy (i.e., no immunomodulators). Clinical criteria used in evaluating patients' responses included i) \"considerable improvement,\" ii) \"improvement,\" and iii) \"no change\" which were objectively defined from patient examinations and evaluation of chest X-ray data as 40 follows: \"Considerable improvement\" required that I) wheezing and catarrhal phenomena disappear completely from the lungs; 2) mononuclear cell infiltration and degen\u00ad erative foci in the lungs largely disappear; 3) cavities of tissue degeneration in the lung disappear; nd 4) expectora\u00ad tion of acid fast bacteria cease; \"Improvement\" required that I) wheezing (only) disappear from the lungs; 2) a progres\u00ad sive resolution of cellular infiltration and degenerative foci in the lungs; and, 3) a partial consolidation of degenerative foci; and 4) a reduction in the size of cavities in the lung. The results of clinical evaluation at 2 months of therapy are summarized in TABLE 46.7.3 \u00b1 0.6 7.3 \u00b1 0.6 12.2 \u00b1 1.1 11.6 \u00b1 1.2 11.4 \u00b1 1.1 11.0 \u00b1 1.3 15.8 \u00b1 0.6 13.3 \u00b1 0.7 13.8 \u00b1 1.4 12.2 \u00b1 1.5 12.7 \u00b1 1.3 11.2 \u00b1 1.7 11.0 \u00b1 1.15.2 \u00b1 0 .3 f t 4.7 \u00b1 0 . 2 f f f 8.1 \u00b1 0 .9 f 9.3 \u00b1 0 .8 f 7.5 \u00b1 0 .8 f t 7.1 \u00b1 0 .7 f 11.3 \u00b1 0 . 8 f f f 9.6 \u00b1 0 .7 f t 8.7 \u00b1 0 .7 f t 7.4 \u00b1 0 .7 f t 8.1 \u00b1 0 .8 f 7.7 \u00b1 1.1 6.6 \u00b1 0 .8 f t TABLE 46 Effects o f Treatment w ith L-Glu-L-Trp on C linical Parameters o f Lung D isease in Patients o f w ith Progressive Tuberculosis: 2 months C onventional Considerable N o.

(Degeneration foci and cavities in the lung were closed in the 9 patients responding rapidly to therapy); in Group 2 (\" decaris\" im m unom odulator com bined therapy), only one patient (5%) showed \"considerable improvement\" and \"improvement\" was observed in 18 to patients, i.e., for a response rate of 8 6%; and, in Group 3 (conventional therapy only), \"considerable improvement\" was noted in 3 patients ( 6%) and \"improvement\" in 36, i.e., for a response rate of 84%. At 4-6 months of in-hospital treatment: in Group I, positive changes were noted in the lungs of 35 of the 37 patients, i.e., closure of degeneration foci and cavities. One patient was discharged from the trial for a procedural violation, and one patient exhibited disease progression of what was determined later to be an antibiotic resistant strain 20 of M. tuberculosis; in Group 2, foci and cavities of degen\u00ad eration in the lungs were closed in 1 0 patients of the 2 2 in the trial (45%), and in Group 3, foci and cavities of degen\u00ad eration in the lungs were closed in 14 patients of the 46 in the trial (48%). Patients tolerated L-Glu-L-Trp therapy well, 25 and no toxicity or allergic reactions were observed EXAMPLE 22 Respiratory Disease: Asthma and Allergy 30 Protocol A Summary Overview. Sixty five patients (65) with bron\u00ad chial asthma, including both adults and children, were entered into the trial: 37 patients were treated with L-Glu- L-Trp and 28 (controls) received conventional therapy alone. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered im in a single daily dose of I /rg/kg on each of 5-10 consecutive days. Treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp resulted in less severe asthmatic clinical symptoms, a decrease in the requisite duration of medical 40 treatment, and a significant reduction in the incidence of bronchial obstruction and laryngotracheitis relative to the control group. In certain patients it was possible to eliminate the use of prescribed steroids. In the year long follow-up period of clinical observation, a 4.2-fold decrease in the incidence of bronchial asthmatic attacks was observed in the L-Glu-L-Trp treated subjects. A disappearance of clinical symptoms of food and drug allergies was observed in more than half of the L-Glu-L-Trp treated patients. Protocol B The use of L-Glu-L-Trp as an ingredient or applicant in cosmetic formulations and preparations provides less aller\u00ad genic materials and/or materials evoking a lesser degree of allergic reactions in sensitized subjects. Protocol C Patient Population: Twenty-eight children (19 boys; 9 girls) were entered into the trial for treatment with L-Glu- 60 L-Trp: 17 were aged 1-3 years; 8 were aged 4\u2014 7 years; and, 3 were aged > 8 years. Patients presented with the following diagnoses: 14 with acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) and bronchitis; 4 with acute respiratory infection (ARI) complicated with recurrent purulent otitis; 2 with ARI and 65 prolonged sub-febrile infection; and, 11 with ARI and lymph node enlargement and hyperplasia of the palatine and114 nasopharyngeal tonsils, Bronchial asthma was diagnosed in 6 children and obstructive bronchitis in 8. In 11 children there was evidence, or medical history of, exudative/ catarrhal diathesis; in 4 there was lymphatic/hypoplastic 5 diathesis. The patient population was also selected for medical history of allergy, and 6 patients had one or more medicinal allergies, 7 had food allergies, 5 had both a food and a medicinal allergy, and one child had a history of bronchospasms initiated by chrysanthemums. Of the chil\u00ad dren 15 had one or more family members with a history of allergy, asthma, hayfever, or medicinal allergy. AU patients had a previous medical history of recurrent infections and had previously received repeated courses of antibacterial preparations, i.e., penicillin-based antibiotics, sulfanil- 15 amides (biseptol), gammaglobulins, and phytotherapy. A comparison (control) group consisted of 73 frequently ill children aged 1-7 years and including 44 boys and 29 girls. Treatment Protocol: The dosage of L-Glu-L-Trp admin\u00ad istered to these children was as follows: children 1-3 years of age received 20 /rg; 4\u2014 5 years of age received 30 /rg; 6-7 years of age received 40 /rg; and, those >7 years of age received 50 ,M g. The L-Glu-L-Trp preparation was adminis\u00ad tered im daily for 5 days and a repeat course of therapy was administered at 3M months. Two treatment courses were required for successful therapy. (Two children with pro\u00ad nounced allergies received Zaditen, and one of the two also received histoglobulin.) Indicators Evaluated: The patients' response to therapy was evaluated by monitoring: physical condition (i.e., by physical examination), body temperature, blood chemistry, proteins, hematology, and immunology. Immunological examination showed lower T-Iymphocyte 35 cell counts in patients prior to treatment than in normal healthy children, w ith a decrease noted in \"active\" T-lymphocytes, i.e., as measured by a decrease in the number of theophylline resistant lymphocytes (\"active\") without a change in number theophylline sensitive lymphocytes (\"quiescent\"). In vitro incubation of lymphocytes, (prepared from thirty of the patients prior to treatment) with L-Glu-L-Trp showed an increase in the percentage of E-rosette forming (CD2+) T-lymphocytes in the respective different patient lympho- 4 5 cyte populations. Parallel incubation with the immunomodu\u00ad lator T-activin did not effect a change in the percentage of positive cells. Following the first course of L-Glu-L-Trp therapy a statistically significant increase was noted in both the abso- 50 lute number and percentage of T-lymphocytes in peripheral blood. A increase in the number of theophylline-resistant lymphocytes was also observed, with a slight decrease in the number of theophylline-sensitive lymphocytes. After the second course of L-Glu-L-Trp immunologic parameters 55 were in the normal range. Clinical evaluation of patients over 6-12 months docu\u00ad mented a decrease in the number of respiratory infections in 92.9% of the children treated with L-Glu-L-Trp, with an average reduction in the number of infections 3.6-fold, and reduction in attacks of bronchial asthma (in the asthma patients) by 4.2-fold. Courses of illness were also milder (than pre-treatment illnesses) and did not require hospital\u00ad ization. Infections in the treated patients were not accom\u00ad panied by complication with bronchial obstruction or otitis. The average length of illness was decreased by 4-5 days, and food allergies disappeared in 67.8% of the patients having this pre-existing condition at the beginning of 5,807,830 115 therapy. Patients experienced an increase in physical activity and appetite, with decrease in subfebrile episodes and mani\u00ad festations of lymphadenopathy. EXAMPLE 23 Gastro-Intestinal Disease Protocol A Gastric Ulcers Gastric ulceration is accompanied by a persistent immu\u00ad nodeficiency condition in the pre-ulcerative stage, i.e., as the ulcer is developing in patients with gastritis. Patient Population: Twenty two patients (all men aged 15 18-30 years) suffering from chronic primary gastritis and gastro-duodenitis were entered into the trial. Diagnosis was based on physical examination, and clinical and laboratory investigations including roentgenoscopy and endoscopic examination of the stomach and duodenum. Patient entry 20 criteria was further conditioned on the results of laboratory tests for i) pre-treatment immune indices (i.e., numbers of lymphocytes, T-, and B-lymphocytes, etc.; TABLE 46) and ii) the in vitro sheep red blood cell rosette forming response of T-lymphocytes to L-Glu-L-Trp, (i.e., whether in vitro 25 incubation of patient peripheral blood lymphocytes with L-Glu-L-Trp increased the percentage of E-RFC). Ten patients (45%) exhibited a negative in vitro response to L-Glu-L-Trp and also exhibited immune indices that were within the normal range, and these patients were excluded 30 from the trial. Twelve patients (55%) exhibited a positive in vitro response to L-Glu-L-Trp and immune indices that were altered, and outside the normal range, i.e., low absolute T-Iymphocyte counts and increased absolute numbers of Null-lymphocytes. These twelve patients were entered into 35 the trial. For determining normal values, the control group con\u00ad sisted of 28 normal healthy volunteers aged 17-23. Treatment Protocol: Patients received L-Glu-L-Tro im 40daily at a dosage of 100 % for 5 days in combination with their conventional ongoing treatment. Laboratory Tests: Lymphocyte sub-populations before and after treatment are presented in TABLE 47, in compari\u00ad son with the results recorded with normal healthy subjects. TABLE 47 Im m unolosv Values: After Normal L-Glu-L-Trp Healthy Before Combination Index Values Therapy Therapy T-Lymphocytes (%): (145%) f , p < 0.05 in com parison w ith normal; f t , p < 0 . 0 0 1 in com parison w ith normal; *, p < 0 . 0 1 in com parison w ith pre-treatm ent values; **, p < 0 . 0 0 1 in com parison w ith pre-treatm ent values. The results presented in TABLE 47 show that treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp induced a statistically significant increase116 in the percentage and absolute numbers of T-lymphocytes, with a concomitant fall in the percentage and numbers of Null-lymphocytes. Clinical Response: Treatment of the patients in the trial 5 population with L-Glu-L-Trp lead to a more rapid recovery and the patients achieved a stable remission of chronic gastritis and gastroenteritis. Protocol B 10 Infectious Disease: Shigella dysenterae Summary Overview: A total 125 patients infected with Shigella dysentery were examined. Fifty-three patients con\u00ad stituted the control group. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered im single doses of 1 0 0 % for 1 0 consecutive days with resultant normalization of fever, reduction of toxemia, and normal\u00ad ization of gastrointestinal disorders and symptoms. Bacterial shedding in the GI track was observed to cease, and the immunological indices were normalized. EXAMPLE 24 Acquired Immunodeficiency: Adult Thymectomy Summary Overview: A total of 12 thymectomized patients were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp. Prior to therapy, these individuals had experienced frequent serious infections including upper respiratory infections. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered in a single dose of 1 0 0 % daily for 1 0 days and repeated every 4-6 months. The normalization of immuno\u00ad logic indices was observed, and there was a reduction of infectious disorders including cutaneous infections and other chronic exacerbations. EXAMPLE 25 Elepatic Diseases Protocol A Jaundice and Systemic Toxicity Summary Overview: Thirty four patients (34) with diag\u00ad nosed chronic liver disease were treated with L-Glu-L-Trp (Group I). Entry into the trial was established on the basis 45 of clinical symptoms and serum biochemistry, i.e., levels of aminotransferase, bilirubin, gamma-globulins, and thymol test results, as well as the results of radioisotope and ultrasound scanning. In certain cases liver biopsy specimens were obtained, and confirmed the diagnosis. Patient entry into the trial was also occasioned by symptoms and either i) 50 presence of an abnormal T-helper/T-suppressor ratio, or ii) detectable levels of Australia antigen in serum. Twenty seven patients (27) fulfilling the same diagnostic criteria were entered into a control group for conventional treat\u00ad ments (Group 2). Immune status was assessed by collecting and testing samples of peripheral blood. The following immune param\u00ad eters were tested: serum concentrations of IgA, IgM, IgG, and IgD; and, the level of circulating immune complexes. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered daily im at a dose of 100 % on each of 5 to 10 consecutive days. At time of entry into the trial, patients in Group I presented with the following: 29 patients were seropositive for hepatitis virus (i.e., 26 patients had circulating Hepatitis 5,807,830 117 B antigen and 3 had circulating autoantibodies); 5 patients had cirrhotic liver disease (3 of viral etiology and 2 or unknown origin) with micronodular and mixed initial stage forms of disease. (L-Glu-L-Trp was not prescribed to patients with dystrophic cirrhotic liver disease.) AU patients presented with abnormally decreased levels of T-suppressor cells in peripheral blood. Clinical Effects: Treatment of the patients in Group I with L-Glu-L-Trp resulted in three different types of clinical responses: i) in 21 of the 29 patients with serological evidence of hepatitis virus infection (above) a positive response to therapy was observed; ii) in the remaining 8 patients (of the 29 seropositive patients) no change was detectable either in the clinical picture or in the serum biochemical markers; and, iii) in 4 patients, (2 having autoantibodies; and 2 with cryptogenic cirrhosis) illness was 15 aggravated. The 21 patients of Group I having a positive response to L-Glu-L-Trp treatments exhibited the following at the con\u00ad clusion of the 5 days of therapy: i) decreased symptoms of cellular insufficiency, weakness, and headache; ii) improved 20 serum biochemical markers (i.e., bilirubin and aminotrans\u00ad ferase activity); iii) improved ability to sleep; and, iv) decreased pain in the hypochondrium. In 2 of the responsive patients, jaundice disappeared with noticeable lessening of telangiectasia in the face. Following treatment, responsive 2s patients showed i) an increase in the number of peripheral blood T-lymphocytes, (primarily because of an increase in the number of suppressor T-cells); and, ii) a decrease in the numbers of undifferentiated Null lymphocytes. In the 3 patients with mixed cirrhotic liver disease of viral etiology, ALT levels in serum dropped, suggesting a positive effect on liver cytology. The 8 patients in Group I having a negative response to L-Glu-L-Trp treatments (i.e., patients with less severe im m u n o d eficien cies and le sse r im m u n o reg u lato ry impairments) exhibited the following at the conclusion of 35 the 5 days of therapy: i) no significant changes in clinical symptoms; ii) no (or minimal) changes in serum biochemi\u00ad cal markers, i.e., ALT and bilirubin levels dropped slightly but AST and thymol test results increased slightly); and iii) lymphocyte counts increased with increases in the number 40 of Null and T-lymphocytes. The 4 patients of Group I having aggravation of disease activity following the L-Glu-L-Trp treatments exhibited the following at the conclusion of the 5 days of therapy: i) increased serum transaminase levels (AST; ALT); ii)118 Patients in the control Group 2 were, as previously, relatively non-responsive to conventional therapy and showed few signs of clinical response to therapy or changes in serum biochemical markers. Protocol B Hepatitis Chronic hepatitis is an urgent problem in pediatric medi- 1\u00b0 cine with 350 million people worldwide registered to be carriers of the virus, and 2 million new cases each year. In I out of 1 0 patients, the viral infection takes a chronic course with cirrhosis of the liver and ultimately a fatal outcome. In 80% of cases of primary hepatoma, a link with the hepatitis virus has been recorded. Patient Population: In accord with a U.S.S.R. Ministry of Health decision 125 children suffering with chronic persis\u00ad tent hepatitis B were entered into this trial over a two month period. Group I consisted of 35 children who received decaris immunomodulatory therapy; Group 2, 38 children who received Thymalin treatments; Group 3, 19 children who received L-Glu-L-Trp; and, Group 4, 32 children who received only conventional symptom specific therapy. AU patients admitted to the trial exhibited signs of secondary immunosuppression, as evidenced by a decrease in the numbers of E-rosette forming T-lymphocytes. Treatment Protocol: L-Glu-L-Trp was administered at a dose of 2 /rg/kg of body mass, im, daily for 3 days, and a repeat (identical) course of treatment was administered 10 days after termination of the first course. Observations: In about 63% patients at the conclusion of L-Glu-L-Trp treatment, numbers of E-RFC T-lymphocytes were increased and the ADCC activity (measured in vitro with antibody-coated target cells) was decreased to normal levels. A retrospective analysis of the data revealed two classes of patients: namely, the 63% responders and the remaining non-responders, i.e., based on differences in clini\u00ad cal responses to therapy, serum levels of ALST, E-RFC, ADCC activity, and T4+/T8+ ratios. Acorrelation was noted between the percentage of non-responders (than responders) with detectable auto-lymphocytotoxic (ALCT) antibodies (a marker for autoimmune disease in the patients), the index of ALCT cytotoxic activity, and the failure of L-Glu-L-Trp treatment to influence these markers in non-responder sub\u00ad jects. L-Glu-L-Trp treatment apparently affected the latter markers in the subgroup of responders.

Disease activity was tracked over 1195,807,830 120 the six months following therapy, and remission was found to negatively correlate with the presence of a pre-treatment autoimmune component (i.e., ALCT). One hundred percent of the patients lacking demonstrable ALCT in the pre\u00ad treatment interval exhibited stable remission over the 6 months of observation, as contrasted with rates of 80% stable remission in patients with moderate ALCT activity, and 0% stable remission in patients with the highest ALCT levels.

Thymus cells were isolated from male guinea pigs (180-200 g) under standard conditions of tissue mincing and differential cen\u00ad trifugation in Medium 199. Isolated thymocytes were treated with trypsin to remove cell surface E-receptors capable of binding rabbit erythrocytes (E). The percentage of cells capable forming E-rosettes (E-RFC) was decreased by about two-fold under these conditions. Thymocytes were prepared from 48 guinea pigs, treated with trypsin, and tested for E-RFC according to Nekam K., et al., Immunopharmacol 5(1):85-94 (1982), incorporated herein Dipeptide L-Glu-L-Trp was dissolved in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl and added to cultures at test concentrations of I mg/mL, 0.01 mg/mL, and 0.0001 mg/mL. The results of these experi\u00ad ments are summarized in TABLE 50.

The results presented in TABLE 50 show that addition of L-Glu-L-Trp at 0.01-1 mg/ mL increased the percentage of E-RFC in trypsin-treated thymocyte cultures. The results suggest that -T rp stim ulates expression of E -recep to rs on thym ocytes over a w ide range of concentrations, perhaps by direct ligand-receptor interaction of L-Glu-L-Trp with the E-rosette receptor. EXAMPLE 27 Effects on Thymocytes from Aged Animals Effects of L-Glu-L-Trp on expression of E-receptors on \"aged\" thymocytes was investigated in a manner similar tothat in EXAMPLE 26, above, but using thymocytes obtained from old male guinea pigs (700-800 g). In aged animals it is recognized that the percentage of thymocytes forming rosettes with rabbit erythrocytes is reduced, and cell surface E-receptors are likewise reduced. For these studies aged thymocytes were isolated in Medium 199 from 42 guinea pigs, and E-RFC determined as described by Stadecker, M. J., et al., J. Immunol. 111(8):4061-4065 (1973), incorpo\u00ad rated herein by reference. L-Glu-L-Trp was dissolved in 0.9% (w/v) NaCl and added to cultures of thymocytes at concentrations of I, 0.01, and 0.0001 mg/ml. The results of these experiments are summarized in TABLE 51.

The results presented in TABLE 51 show, as expected, a reduction in the percentage of E-RFC in populations of aged thymocytes, i.e., from 66\u00b15% (TABLE 62) to 45.3\u00b13.7% (TABLE 51). L-Glu-L-Trp fostered a statistically significant increase in the percentage of E-RFC at I mg/mL. EXAMPLE 28 Effects of Dipeptide L-Glu-L-Trp on T-Lymphocyte Subsets in Human Peripheral Blood The effects of L-Glu-L-Trp on human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes was investigated using indirect immunofluo\u00ad rescence microscopy and OKT4 and OKT 8 monoclonal antibodies (Ortho, USA) directed to lymphocyte cell surface differentiation antigens. For these studies lymphocytes were isolated from heparinized peripheral blood (25 units heparin/ mL) isolated from 18 different donors with inflammatory lung diseases and chronic purulent bronchitis accompanied by a secondary immunodeficiency state. Lymphocytes were prepared by centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque, washed, and then incubated in vitro for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. in the presence (or absence) of L-Glu-L-Trp at concentrations of I mg/mL, 0.01 mg/mL, 0.0001 mg/mL. Following incubation the cells were washed with Medium 199 and the percentage of OKT4+ (T-helper) and immunofluorescent micros\u00ad copy. The results presented in TABLE 51 show the mean percentages of OKT4+ and OKT 8+ cells in this group of patients after incubation with Medium 199 (Control), or with L-Glu-L-Trp. The OKT4+/OKT8+ ratios for this group of patients is also shown in TABLE 52.5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 1215,807,830 122 TABLE 52 Effects of L-Glu-L-Trp on T-helper (OKT4+) and T-suppressor (OKT 8+) of these treatments were determined on day 1 0 (i.e., 5 days after the last injection) by preparing cells from peripheral blood (PBL), thymus (), lymph nodes (LN), spleen (SPL), and red pulp of bone marrow (BM ). Cells 5 were tested for antibody Fe receptors (EA-RFC), comple\u00ad m to the method of Bianco, C., et al., J. 10 Exp. Med. 132(4):702-720 (1970). The results of these analyses are shown in TABLES 53-54, below, where data are expressed either as the number of RFCxlO 9 per liter of blood, or RFCxlO 3 per milligram (mg) of tissue.

EXAMPLE 29 Effects of Dipeptide L-Glu-L-Trp on Immunity in Experimental Animals Protocol A: Healthy Guinea Pigs Immune parameters were investigated in healthy male guinea pigs (250-300xg) following administration of test or control agents. Each test and control group consisted of 10 animals. Test agents were administered to animals once daily by the intramuscular (im) route over a period of 5 days and at I mg/kg dipeptide L-Glu-L-Trp.

At 10 days, animals who received L-Glu-L- Trp showed an increased number of T-lymphocytes in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow. L-Glu-L-Trp increased Fc-receptor bearing cells in spleen and bone marrow (TABLE 53). Numbers of complement receptor bearing cells (EAC-RFC) were increased 2-fold in blood by L-Glu-L-Trp treatment (TABLE 54). The results indicate that L -G lu-L-Trp stim ulated proliferation, differentiation, or m igration and B-lymphocytes. Protocol B: Gamma-Irradiated Guinea Pigs X-irradiation an accepted experimental animal model for depressing cellular immune mechanisms operative in anti\u00ad bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-parasitic immunity. The levels 5,807,830 123 of lymphocytes in thymus, spleen, and lymph node are decreased following sub-lethal radiation exposure, and the effects of L-Glu-L-Trp on recovery of immune function following radiation exposure were investigated in this model. 142 guinea pigs were exposed to I Gy of X-irradiation and then treated with L-Glu-L-Trp at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg daily for 5 days starting two days after the irradiation. Immunologic indices were determined at 5, 10, and 20 days to by preparing samples of immune cells from thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, and peripheral blood. Cell preparations were analyzed to determine the content of lymphocytes, E-RFC ( i . e . , T - ly m p h o c y te s ) , E A -R F C ( \" a c t i v a t e d \" T-lymphocytes), and EAC-RFC (i.e., B-lymphocytes). (The materials and methods used in these analyses are presented following EXAMPLE 38, below. The results obtained in these experiments are summarized in TABLE 55.124 trol II), i.e., at 5 days and 10 the lymphocyte counts decreased to 56% and then 18%, respectively, of normal levels. A partial return of immune cells was observed at day 5 20 with 53% of normal lymphocyte levels. Lymphocyte subpopulations in irradiated control decreased in a parallel fashion, i.e., both T- and B-lymphocytes. L-Glu-L-Trp treat\u00ad ments resulted in a statistically significant increase in the number of thymic lymphocytes, i.e., from 56% to 82% of normal, on day 5; and from 18% to 56% on day 10. Similarly, thymic T-Iymphocyte counts were increased on day 5 from 25% to 67% and on day 10 from 13% to 51%. L-Glu-L-Trp treatment was found to exhibit similar effects 15 on splenic and lymph node T- and B-lymphocytes, TABLE 56.

Predictably, the majority of the decrease was evident in the short-lived B-Iym phocyte subpopulation, and splenic T-lymphocytes proved more radiation resistant. Treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp significantly increased the numbers of splenic B-lymphocytes (i.e., EAC-RFC) on days 5 and 10; with increases on day 5 from 49% to 82% of normal, and on day 10 from 70% to 100%.30 35The results presented in TABLE 57 show that irradiated guinea pigs exhibited decreased num bers of T- and B-lymphocytes in lymph nodes, i.e., 23% of normal T-cell levels on day 10 and only 14% of normal B-cell levels. Treatm ent w ith L -G lu-L-Trp significantly increased T-Iymphocyte counts in lymph nodes on days 5, 10 and 20 and B-Iymphocyte counts were statistically elevated on day 5. On day 10 and day 20 B-cell counts in the lymph nodes of L-Glu-L-Trp treated animals remained low, presumably because afferent repopulation with immune cells requires antigen stimulation.

As expected, the results presented in TABLE 58 show that peripheral blood lymphocytes from irradiated guinea pigs exhibited increased non-specific radiation-induced respon\u00ad to Concanavalin-A cationic proteins. (Increased non-specific mito\u00ad gen responsiveness in irradiated animals is correlated with decreased lymphocyte responsiveness to specific antigens, e.g., pathogens.) Treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp resulted in a statistically significant decrease in Con-A responsiveness and increased levels of neutrophil cationic proteins. Both of these findings are consistent with the conclusion that L-Glu- L-Trp treatments increased neutrophil-mediated immunity to pathogens, and lymphocyte responsiveness to foreign agents.

Thymus and spleen weights were determined in the non-induced animals; cell suspensions were prepared from each thymus and spleen; and, resident peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were harvested by lavage with Medium 199 from each animal. The percent\u00ad age content of T- and B-lymphocytes in the splenic cell populations from the non-induced animals was determined by phase-contrast and indirect im m unofluorescence Shtorkh, V., & Emmrikh, I.

NBT reduction was quantified spetrophotometrically at 540 nm. Pinocytic activity of the resident peritoneal macrophages was assessed by measuring u p ta k e o f n e u t r a l re d d y e ( m e a s u r e d spectrophotometrically). The percentage of neutrophils in the PEC population was determined using phase contrast microscopy and complement-opsonized zymosan. Phago\u00ad cytic activity of neutrophils was determined by incubating the cells with 2.5x10s Staphylococcus aureus per milliliter (S. aureus from a 24 hour culture). The data were expressed as both the percentage of phagocytic cells (% of the total cell population phagocytizing I or more Staphylococci) and the phagocytic index (expressed as the mean number of intra\u00ad cellular bacteria inside each of the phagocytically active neutrophils), both measurements being made by micro\u00ad scopic examination following Romanovsky-Giemsa stain\u00ad ing of cell smears. The results of these respective experimental measure\u00ad ments on cells contributing to innate mechanisms of immu\u00ad nity are summarized in TABLES 59-64.

Next (on day 6), each group of animals was sub-divided into two subgroups of 10 animals each: i.e., one subgroup of animals was injected ip with 10% sterile proteose peptone to induce neutrophils 65 (induced), while the other subgroup were non-induced (non- induced). The animals of the four induced-subgroups wereThe results presented in TABLE 59 show L-Glu-L-Trp induced a statistically significant decrease in thymic weight at both dosages, and had opposing effects on splenic weight at the indicated dosages. Interestingly, the I mg/kg dosage of L-Glu-L-Trp administered in these studies approximates a clinically effective dosage in humans for immune stimula\u00ad tion. The results presented in TABLES 60-65, show the effects of this agent on individual cell populations and their activi\u00ad ties. 5,807,830 129 TABLE 60 demonstrates the effects of L-Glu-L-Trp on the mean percentage of T- and B-lymphocytes isolated in the cell populations from the spleens of treated animals.130 In TABLE 62 are shown the results of experiments designed to examine the pinocytic activity of resident peri\u00ad toneal macrophages from the respective treatment groups.

The results presented in TABLE 63 show that ip pretreat\u00ad ment with L-Glu-L-Trp (0.1 mg/kg) doubled the number of neutrophils that could be induced following injection of proteose peptone. It is interesting that the total volume of exudate obtained from L-Glu-L-Trp treated animals (0.01 mg/kg) was increased relative to the volume obtained from controls and the cell concentration was correspondingly decreased, i.e., 0 .9 x l0 6 for L-Glu-L-Trp versus 1.9x10\u00ae for control. In TABLE 64, are shown the results of experiments designed to test the phagocytic activity of the neutrophils induced by the proteose peptone injection. 5,807 , 131 TABLE 64 Effect 18.8 \u00b1 0.29 1 0 I 31.5 \u00b1 0.4* 1.89 \u00b1 0.03 0 .1 0 .1 17.8 \u00b1 1.13 1.90 \u00b1 0.05 *, statistically significant at the p < 0 .0 1 level in com parison w ith the values recorded in controls. 25 The results presented in TABLE 64 show that the six day ip pretreatment course of L-Glu-L-Trp (I mg/kg) induced statistically significant 1.5-fold and 1.7-fold increases, respectively, in the percentage of phagocytic cells induced into the peritoneal cavity following injection of a sterile 20 inflammatory challenge with proteose peptone. The phago\u00ad cytic capacity of the neutrophils induced in this manner was finite, i.e., about two Staphylococci per neutrophil in saline control or peptide treated animals. L-Glu-L-Trp pretreat\u00ad ment at a dose of 0.01 mg/kg did not appear to stimulate 25 neutrophil migration in response to the sterile proteose peptone inflammatory stimulus (TABLE 63), nor the phago\u00ad cytic activity of the cells so induced (TABLE 64). The results presented in EXAMPLES 26-29, above, indicate the following: i) L-Glu-L-Trp treatment can cause 30 redistribution of lymphoid cell populations in animals; ii) L-Glu-L-Trp treatment did not alter the activity of resident peritoneal macrophages; iii) L-Glu-L-Trp treatment stimu\u00ad lated both the number of neutrophils entering the tissue in response to a sterile inflammatory challenge and the per- 35 centage of phagocytically active cells in the cell exudate population; iv) L-Glu-L-Trp appeared to exhibit dosage- dependent differential effects, i.e., at the I mg/kg dose,830 132 EXAMPLE 31 Effects of L-Glu-L-Trp on Induction of Antibody Responses as Measured by Jerne Plaque Formation Thirteen male (CBAxC57Bl/6) F l mice, 10-12 weeks of age (22\u00b10.2 g) were challenged with a single intraperitoneal (ip) injection of 2.5 x l0 7 sheep red blood cells (s-rbc) in 0.5 mL normal saline. Within 20 minutes after the injection of s-rbc an L-Glu-L-Trp treatment trial was initiated by inject\u00ad ing 0.2 mL of the dipeptide preparation at a concentration sufficient to deliver a unit dosage of 1.0 /rg/kg, 10 /rg/kg, or 100 /rg/kg. The same dosage was delivered daily for the next three days. Control animals (13 per group) included: i) non-s-rbc-immunized and ii) s-rbc immunized but non L-Glu-L-Trp-treated. At day 5 (post-s-rbc challenge), the spleens of the animals were removed and splenocytes pre\u00ad pared by homogenizing the spleens in a loose fitting glass Dounce-type homogenizer, followed by screening of the cell suspension through a caprone filter, and differential centrifu\u00ad gation (yield about IO8 cells/spleen). Antibody-producing cells (AbPC) in the splenocyte preparations were quantified using the well known method of Jerne and Nordin. Briefly, concentrations of 5 x l0 4 to IO6 splenocytes were mixed with a 2% solution of s-rbc (% volume packed cells/volume medium) and incorporated into an agarose layer in petri dishes. Uie dishes were incubated for 60 minutes at 37\u00b0 C. (in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2), to allow APC to synthesize anti\u00ad body capable of binding to the surrounding s-rbc in the agarose matrix. After the 60 minute incubation, a 1:20 dilution of guinea pig serum was added as a source of complement and clear zones of s-rbc lysis (surrounding the AbPCs) were recorded by microscopic observation after an additional 60 minutes incubation. Uie results are summa\u00ad rized in TABLE 65. TABLE 65 Effects o f L-Glu-L-Trp on the A ntibody Plaque Forming Test A gentDose (>/kg)Spleen weight/ Body weightSplenocytes 80 19 < 0.05 level (Student's t-test) relative to the values recorded in the Non-imm unized control group of animals; {statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level relative to the values recorded in the s-rbc immunized, saline treated, control group of animals. 55 neutrophils were stimulated, but at the lower 0.01 mg/kg dose, macrophages, and not neutrophils, were stimulated, with a possible mobilization of thymic and bone marrow lymphocytes and increased T-Iymphocytes in the spleen at the conclusion of the 6 day ip treatment regimen. H ie combined results indicate that treatment with L-Glu- L-Trp can induce changes in distribution of lymphocyte cell populations, and changes in distribution and activities of macrophages and neutrophils, both of which changes favor a heightened state of innate immunity in the treated animals. For these and other reasons L-Glu-L-Trp is termed an \"immunomodulator\" .60 65The results presented in TABLE 65 show that 3 daily ip treatments with L-Glu-L-Trp at a dose of I /rg/kg, when delivered after an ip challenge with s-rbc, significantly increased the number of PFC in spleen by 2.7-fold over the values recorded in the saline-treated control animals. The frequency of PFC's expressed per IO6 splenocytes also increased by 2.8-fold. Spleen weights of the animals treated with the I /rg/kg dosage of L-Glu-L-Trp did not increase, and in fact, decreased slightly (but significantly), and total splenocytes harvested from the treated animals were also lower, but still within the range harvested from the saline control animals. Thus, treatment with I /rg/kg L-Glu-L-Trp 5.807.830 133 increased the number and frequency of antigen producing cells within the total spleen cell population but without increasing the total num ber of cells in the spleen. Interestingly, treatments at dosages of 10 /rg/kg and 100 /rg/kg L-Glu-L-Trp resulted in significantly fewer spleno\u00ad cytes being harvested than from the saline control animals, and although 1.8-fold and 1.6-fold more PFCs were recorded (on a per spleen basis) than in saline control animals, the possibility exists that the higher doses activated AbPCs at the local site (or in local lymph nodes), and that the cells so activated failed to traffic to the spleen. EXAMPLE 32 Therapeutic Efficacy of L-Glu-L-Trp in an Experimental Animal Model of Acute Peritoneal Bacterial Infection as Determined by Survival Following Intraperitoneal Infection with an LD 100 dose of E. coli Therapeutic efficacy of L-Glu-L-Trp was tested in a murine experimental animal model of acute gram negative infection. The lethal dosage of E. coli gram negative rods in the experimental model was in a stepwise manner. First, the number of bacteria equivalent to the LD 50 dose (50% survival) was determined by injecting intraperitoneally dif\u00ad ferent log dosages of bacteria and determining the percent\u00ad age of animals surviving 72 hours later. The LD 100 dose (1 0 0% mortality) was calculated by multiplying the number of bacteria in the LD 50 dose times 10. Second, the mean effective dose (ED) of ampicillin sufficient to effect 100% survival of animals receiving one LD 50 dose of antibiotic- sensitive bacteria was determined. Mice were divided into five L-Glu-L-Trp treatment groups, five combined treatment groups (i.e., L-Glu-L-Trp+ a n tib io tic ), an an tib io tic treatm en t co n tro l group (Ampicillin), and a saline control group (Control), with eighteen animals in each group. In the L-Glu-L-Trp treat\u00ad ment groups, mice received a prophylactic L-Glu-L-Trp treatment administered daily beginning 3 days before bac\u00ad terial challenge (i.e., day -3 through day I) as intraperito- neal injections of 0 .0 1 /rg/kg, 0 .1 /rg/kg, 1 .0 /rg/kg, 1 0 /rg/kg, or 100 /rg/kg. In the five combined treatment groups, mice received the same five intraperitoneal dosages of L-Glu-L- Trp and, in addition, ampicillin equivalent to one MED. In the antibiotic control group, mice received only ampicillin, and in the saline control group, an injection of saline administered under the same conditions. On day 0, a number of bacteria equivalent to one LD 100 was administered to all animals. Survival was determined after 24, 48, and 72 hours. The results of these studies are summarized in TABLE 6 6.

EXAMPLE 33 25 Therapeutic Efficacy of L-Glu-L-Trp in an Experimental Animal Model of Acute Peritoneal Bacterial Infection as Determined by Survival 3 Q Following Intraperitoneal Infection with an LD 100 dose of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Therapeutic efficacy of L-Glu-L-Trp was tested in a murine experimental animal model of acute gram negative 35 infection. The lethal dosage of Pseudomonas bacilli in the experimental model was in a stepwise manner. First, the number of bacilli equivalent to the LD 50 dose (50% survival) was determined by injecting intraperitoneally dif- ferent log dosages of bacilli and determining the percentage of animals surviving 96 hours later. The theoretical LD 100 dose ( 1 0 0% mortality) was calculated by multiplying the number of bacteria in the LD 50 dose times 10. Second, the mean effective dose (MED) of ampicillin sufficient to effect 45 100% survival of animals receiving one LD 50 dose of antibiotic-sensitive bacilli was determined. Mice were divided into five L-Glu-L-Trp treatment groups, five combined treatment groups (i.e., L-Glu-L-Trp+ 50 a n tib io tic), an an tib io tic treatm en t co n tro l group (Gentamycin), and a saline control group (Control), with eighteen animals in each group. In the L-Glu-L-Trp treat\u00ad ment groups, mice received a prophylactic L-Glu-L-Trp 55 treatment administered daily for 3 days before bacterial challenge as a daily intraperitoneal injection of 0 .0 1 /rg/kg, 0.1 /rg/kg, 1.0 /rg/kg, 10 /rg/kg, or 100 /rg/kg. In the five combined treatment groups, mice received the same five intraperitoneal dosages of L-Glu-L-Trp and, in addition, 60 gentamycin equivalent to one MED. In the antibiotic control group, mice received only gentamycin, and in the saline control group, an injection of saline administered under the same conditions. On day 0, a number of bacilli equivalent to 65 one LD 100 was administered to all animals. Survival was determined after 24, 48, and 96 hours. The results of these studies are summarized in TABLE 67. 5,807,830 135 TABLE 67 Effects of L-Glu-L-Trp on Survival Rate (%) o f M ice as a Function of Time A fter Induction of A cute Injection Group (\u00abg/kg) 24 48 96 Saline Control 0 0 0 0 L-Glu-L-Trp 10 55.6* 5.6 100 66.7*f 38.9* 10 77.8*f 6 1 .1 * 6 1 .1 * + 100 83.3*f 77.8*f$ 77.8*f$ G entamycin 1000 io o * n 88.9*f$ 77.8*f$ * statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level in com parison w ith the saline control values; {statistically significant (p < 0.05) as com pared to the G entamycin-treatment control; ^statistically significant (p < 0.05) com pared with the corresponding dosage o f L-Glu-L-Trp w ithout Gentamycin. The results presented in TABLE 67 show that L-Glu-L- Trp alone, or in combination therapy with gentamycin, significantly increased the percentage of mice surviving a 25 lethal challenge of Pseudomonas. EXAMPLE 34 Therapeutic Efficacy of L-Glu-L-Trp in an Experimental Animal Model of Acute Peritoneal Bacterial Infection as Determined by Survival Following Intraperitoneal Infection with an LD 100 Dose of Antibiotic-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Therapeutic efficacy of L-Glu-L-Trp was tested in a murine experimental animal model of acute gram positive infection. The lethal dosage of Staphylococci in the experi\u00ad mental model was in a stepwise manner. First, the number of bacteria equivalent to an LD 50 dose (50% survival) was 40 determined by injecting intraperitoneally different log dos\u00ad ages of Staphylococci and determining the percentage of animals surviving 72 hours later. The theoretical LD 100 dose (1 0 0% mortality) was calculated by multiplying the number of bacteria in the LD 50 dose times 10. Second, the mean 45 effective dose (MED) of ampicillin sufficient to effect 100% survival of animals receiving one LD 50 dose of methicillin- sensitive staphylococci was determined, i.e., 1 0 0 mg/kg when administered ip one hour after bacterial challenge. (In this animal model, methicillin-resistant Staphylococci were 50 used as the bacterial challenge and ampicillin on its own was not sufficient to prevent mortality.) Mice were divided into five L-Glu-L-Trp treatment groups, five combined treatment groups (i.e., L-Glu-L-Trp+ antibiotic), an antibiotic treatment control group, and a 55 saline control treatment group, with eighteen animals in each group. In the L-Glu-L-Trp treatment groups, mice received a prophylactic L-Glu-L-Trp treatment administered daily for 3 days before bacterial challenge as daily intrap\u00ad eritoneal injections of 0 .0 1 /rg/kg, 0 .1 /rg/kg, 1 .0 /rg/kg, 1 0 60 /rg/kg, or 100 /rg/kg. In the five combined treatment groups, mice received the same five intraperitoneal dosages of L-Glu-L-Trp and, in addition, ampicillin equivalent to one MED. In the antibiotic control group, mice received only ampicillin, and in the saline control group, an injection of 65 saline administered under the same conditions. On day 0, a number of bacteria equivalent to one LD 100 was adminis-136 tered to all animals. Survival was determined after 24, 48, and 72 hours. The results of these studies are summarized in TABLE 6 8.

The results presented in TABLE 6 8 are presented graphi\u00ad cally in FIGS. 3A -3D as a function of the i) time after injection of the bacterial challenge dose (i.e., hrs.); and, ii) 35 the dose in mg/kg of single agent L-Glu-L-Trp or of com\u00ad bination therapy with L-Glu-L-Trp and ampicillin. The results obtained in expanded dose-response studies of single agent and combined treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp ip and im are presented in FIGS. 3C, 3D, 3E, and 3F. The results confirm and extend those presented in TABLE 6 8. L-Glu-L-Trp administered by the ip or im routes increased the percentage of animals surviving challenge with a lethal number of Staphylococcus aureus. The experimental proto\u00ad col disclosed in EXAMPLE 34 was repeated three times with substantially the same results. One of the three experi\u00ad mental iterations utilized S. aureus (ATCC 33593) to control for possible theoretical variations in the laboratory strain of Staphylococci used in the other studies. No difference was noted between the results obtained with ATCC 33593 and the laboratory staphylococcal strain. Additional studies of protection afforded to mice by different routes of delivery of L-Glu-L-Trp are summarized in TABLE 69.

The duration of the prophylactic effects of L-Glu-L-Trp were investigated by administering therapy ip or im at doses of I /rg/kg, 10 /rg/kg, 1000 /rg/kg, or 11000 /rg/kg (alone or in combination with ampicillin) at 120 hrs., 72 hrs., 48 hrs., 24 hrs., or I hr. before staphylococcal challenge. Survival was evaluated (as above) at 24, 48, and 72 hrs. after challenge with an LD100 dose of Staphylococci. Adminis\u00ad tering L-Glu-L-Trp (alone) as a single injection ip 24 hours before bacterial challenge resulted in greater numbers of surviving animals compared to animals pretreated at I, 48, or 72 hrs. Combination therapy with L-Glu-L-Trp and ampicillin (ip) was also most effective when administered 24 hours before the bacterial challenge. W hen combination therapy (L-Glu-L-Trp+ampicillin) was administered im, rather than ip, at 120 hrs., 72 hrs., or 48 hrs. before bacterial challenge, a similar percentage of survival resulted, and this was greater than that achieved by administering the prophy\u00ad lactic treatment I hr before bacterial challenge. The affects of administering multiple prophylactic doses of single agent (L-Glu-L-Trp) or combination therapy (i.e., ampicillin) was investigated by treating ip (or im) at 72, 48, and 24 hrs. before bacterial challenge. Survival was assessed (as above) at 24, 48, and 72 hrs. after challenge with an LD100 dose of Staphylococci. The multiple treatment regi\u00ad men gave significantly higher (p<0.05) survival rates than a single treatment dose at 72, or 48, or 24 hrs. for either single agent or combined therapy, and multiple injections im resulted in higher survival that if the injections were admin\u00ad istered ip. The therapeutic efficacy of L-Glu-L-Trp was also inves\u00ad tigated in the same experimental animal model of acute bacterial infection by initiating intraperitoneal infection in mice with an LD100 dose of Staphylococci, and then initi\u00ad ating treatment I hour later with an ip injection of dipeptide, or dipeptide and antibiotic (i.e., ampicillin).

The results presented in TABLE 70 shows a dose- response relationship between the amount of L-Glu-L-Trp administered ip and the survival of animals challenged with a lethal dose of Staphylococcus aureus. Combination therapy with L-Glu-L-Trp and antibiotic (i.e., ampicillin) proved more effective than single agent therapy (i.e., L-Glu- L-Trp alone), and again exhibited a dose-response relation\u00ad ship between treatment dose and survival. EXAMPLE 35 Effects of Synthetic Peptide L-Glu-L-Trp on Hematopoietic Activity of Bone Marrow The effects of L-Glu-L-Trp on bone marrow hematopoi\u00ad etic activity was investigated in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) immu- nosuppressed CBA mice. Mice were treated with a dose schedule of 5-FU determined empirically to be sufficient to decrease the absolute number of bone marrow cells and peripheral blood leukocytes by about 50% on day 10-14. Treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp was initiated on day 10, and I /rg/kg was administered ip daily on that day and each of the following 4 days. Bone marrow and peripheral blood cell populations were quantified on day 15.

In the bone marrow (TABLE 71), treatments with L-Glu-L-Trp resulted in: i) an increase in the numbers of myelocytes/neutrophils, stab and segmented neutrophils, and megakaryocytes; ii) no marked changes in the total numbers of myelokaryocytes, reticular cells, monocytes, erythroblasts, and erythroid cells; and, iii) a decrease in the absolute num bers o f m yelo b lasts, p ro m y elo b lasts, eosinophils, and lymphocytes. In the peripheral blood (TABLE 72) the following observations were recorded: i)the total number of neutrophils increased (i.e., in parallel with the observed increase in bone marrow neutrophils); ii) the absolute number of monocytes dropped slightly, but insignificantly, since the percentage of monocytes in periph\u00ad eral blood was about 2-3% before and after treatment; and, iii) the total number of peripheral blood lymphocytes increased (i.e., in parallel with the observed decrease in bone marrow lymphocytes). The observed decrease in bone mar\u00ad row lymphocytes and increase in peripheral blood lympho\u00ad cytes was consistent with L-Glu-L-Trp mobilization of these cells into the peripheral blood. The effects of the L-Glu-L- Trp treatment on other peripheral blood leukocyte popula\u00ad tions in the 5-FU immunosuppressed mice are summarized in TABLE 72.

In the 5,807,830 141 experimental group, L-Glu-L-Trp was administered in three treatment courses, each course consisting of 10 daily im injections of 10 /rg/kg or 100 /rg/kg, and each course of treatment separated from the next course by a I month interval. In the control group, saline was administered in the same three treatment course schedule. Differential blood counts were conducted on day 0 Normal Control), day 59, and day 79 of the study. L-Glu-L-Trp treatment at dosages of both 10 /rg/kg and 100 /rg/kg significantly (p<0.05) increased the number of leukocytes, monocytes, and Iym- to phocytes in the peripheral blood of cortisone-suppressed rats relative to the saline treated controls. Results obtained with the 10 /rg/kg treatment dose (presented in TABLE 73) were not markedly different than those obtained with the 100 /ig/kg dose.142 of 7 consecutive days ip into C3H/HeJ mice at a dose of I, 10, or 1000 /rg/kg (0.5 mL/mouse). Cyclophosphamide (50 /rg/kg), or saline, were used as reference treatments. On day 8, spleen cells were prepared and diluted to 5 x l0 6 cells/ml. 5 YAC-I target cells were suspended at 5 x l0 6 cells/mL in Tris buffer containing 200 /rCi/ml of 51Cr. After a I hour incu\u00ad bation at 37\u00b0 C. the YAC-I cells (target cells) were washed 3 times, and resuspended at a concentration of IxlO 5 cells/ mL. Each 100 /iL aliquot of target cells was mixed with a 100 /iL aliquot of splenocytes (effector cells) in a well of a 96 well microtiter plate. Spontaneous release from the target cells was determined by incubating without effector cells; maximal release was determined by lysing target cells with IN E1C1.

EXAMPLE 37 Stimulation of Natural Killer Cell Cytotoxic Activity by L-Glu-L-Trp Treatments Natural killer cells (i.e., NK lymphocytes) are considered by many to be one element of innate resistance to infection. L-Glu-L-Trp was tested under GLP conditions for its ability to effect a change in the activity of splenic natural killer (NK) lymphocytes. L-Glu-L-Trp was injected daily on each60after 4 hours incubation at 37\u00b0 C. Specific 51Cr-release was calculated according to the following formula: 65(C P M experim ental release) - { C P M spontaneous release) ( C P M m ax. release) - (C P M spontaneous release)x 100% The mean value for each group of 10 animals.

EXAMPLE 38 Stimulation of Anti-Viral Activity by Treatments with L-Glu-L-Trp Innate mechanisms of anti-viral immunity are important to survival of the host. The Rauscher murine leukemia virus144 assays (i.e., host cells) and serum anti-viral antibody titers were used to assess infection. Spleens achieved about 2.0 grams in weight within 21 days of infection, as compared with a normal 5 spleen weights in an uninfected animals of about 0.1 gram. Mice were inoculated with Rauscher MuLV complex (0.1 :o m l/7.8xl04 PFU/mL) on day 0 and sacrificed on day 21. Test groups were comprised of 10 mice and control groups 6 mice. Control articles included saline and AZT (in drinking water at about 1.25 mg/mouse/day=63 mg/kg/day/mouse). 15 L-Glu-L-Trp was administered ip on each of 5 consecutive days to different groups of animals at doses of either I, 10, 50,100 or 500 /rg/kg. A non-infected group of mice was also sacrificed on day 21 to provide normal control values.

Although anti-viral agents may exhibit viricidal activity in this model, many (if not most) immunomodulatory compounds lack significant 60 activity in this animal model. The virus employed in present GLP/blinded study was a murine leukemia complex known to induce progressive erythroleukemia in mice (i.e., Raus- cher MuLV and replication-defective Rauscher spleen focus-forming virus). Disease manifested within about 6 65 days with death by about 50 days. M easurements of splenomegaly, blood reverse transcriptase, virus plaqueThe results presented in TABLE 75 show that treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp significantly decreased viremia (i.e., at a dosage of 50 /rg/kg), even in animals exhibiting splenom\u00ad egaly. EXAMPLE 39 Stimulation of Changes in Cyclic Nucleotides (cAMP/cGMP) Following Treatments with L-Glu- L-Trp Normal guinea pigs (10/group) were treated with 10 /rg/kg L-Glu-L-Trp daily on each of five consecutive days and then 5,807,830 145 146 spleens were removed, lymphocytes isolated, and cyclic EXAMPLE 40 AMP and GMP levels determined.

Treatments with L-Glu-L-Trp sig\u00ad nificantly elevated the levels of cAMP and cGMP in sensi\u00ad tized animals (Group 3) as well as anaphylactic animals (Group 5). The results suggest a significant stimulatory effect of L-Glu-L-Trp on lymphocytes in anaphylactic ani- 35 mals. Anaphylaxis is known to be accompanied by release of negative regulators of lymphocyte and macrophage func\u00ad tion. Evidence of a stimulatory effect of L-Glu-L-Trp treat\u00ad ments in this model is presently considered highly sugges\u00ad tive of a possible therapeutic efficacy in a variety of acute 40 and chronic disease settings where lymphocyte and mono\u00ad cyte function is known to be down-regulated, e.g., septicmycobacterial infection. Mice were inoculated iv with 0.1 25 mg (dry weight) of a mouse-passaged and adapted virulent laboratory strain of M. bovis. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered daily and the effects compared with those achieved with isoniazid (INH; also administered daily). Doses of L-Glu- L-Trp were I, 10 and 100 /rg/kg ip and INH was adminis\u00ad tered at 5 mg/kg sc. Survival was assessed out to 62 days post-infection. The treatment schedule included prophylac\u00ad tic and therapeutic regimens as follows: (i) prophylactic/ therapeutic treatm ents w ith L-Glu-L-Trp consisted of administering the test dose ip daily on each of 5 consecutive days of each week of the study starting 3 days before infecting the animals; and, (ii) therapeutic treatments with L-Glu-L-Trp consisted of administering the test dose ip daily on each of 5 consecutive days of each week starting at week 3 of the study. The survival statistics at 27 days are presented in TABLE 77.

The results are particularly noteworthy because they compare the effects of a proven anti-microbial compound (i.e., isoniazid) with those of an immune modulator (i.e., L-Glu-L-Trp). EXAMPLE 41 Treatment of Murine Candida albicans Infection with L-Glu-L-Trp In this animal C. albicans cells germi\u00ad nate rapidly within 2-4 hours as evidenced by formation of germ tubes. Administration of anti-mycotic preparations (e.g., amphotericin) or certain immunomodulators can entirely block germ tube development. Germ tube develop\u00ad ment was monitored histologically and mean survival time served as the endpoint in Study 41A and mean survival time in Study 41B. Study 41A: Mice were inoculated ip with 5 x l0 6 C. albicans cells that had been germinated rapidly in vitro by shifting from Sabouraud agar (tubes) to sterile saline and rotary culture in order to favor development of germ tubes (i.e., lateral pseudohyphal filaments protruding from the spherical yeast cells). Six hours after inoculation mice were euthanized the epiploons removed and fixed in 10% forma\u00ad lin for histological analysis, using periodic acid Schiff's to visualize the yeast in the tissues. The percentage of germ- tube positive yeast cells was determined microscopically at 400x in the histological preparations. Five different doses of L-Glu-L-Trp were tested by ip administration: i.e., 300, 100, 10, I, and 0.1 /rg/kg. Ampho\u00ad tericin was used as a positive control and saline as a negative control. The treatments were administered daily on each of the three consecutive days with the last ip injection being 3 hours before inoculating the yeast. At least 300 yeast cells (about 10 microscopic fields) were evaluated. The total number of fungal cell, number of non-germinated forms, and number of cells were germ tubes were all determined. Results are expressed as the mean percentage of yeast cells with germ tubes\u00b1SEM for each group of animals. A value (Student's t-test) of p<0.05 was considered statistically significance.148 TABLE 78 Survival o f M ice after Infection w ith a Lethal D ose o f C . a l b i c a n s and L-G lu-L -T Therapy ______ D o se Germ Group A m photericin Therapy3 EW b (/kg) Tube (%) I _ N on e _ 0 37 2B + Control - 0 .063 m g 20* 2C + - 0 .125 m g 17* 2D + - 0 .25 m g 14* 2E + - 0.5 m g 3* 2F + - I m g I * 3 A - PDR + 0.1 ,Mg 35* 3B - +I /< g 34* 3C - + 10 ,Mg 35* 3D - + 100 / / g 26* 3E - + 300 / / g 37 20 w P < 0-05 com pared to saline control group #1; (3) P D R , prophylactic drug regimen; (b) EW = L-Glu-L-Trp the LD95 value (=14.9x10\u00ae cells/animal) was determined by injecting different numbers of C. albicans cells iv into mice and recording deaths at 20 days.

Prophylaxis con\u00ad sisted of 3 ip injections on 3 consecutive days, with the last 35 injection being 3 hours before injecting the C. albicans cells iv. Therapy consisted of 10 consecutive daily ip injections starting 24 hours after the iv injection of the C. albicans cells. Mean survival was determined at 10 days, and as an independent monitor for infection, kidneys were removed 40 from nine parallel groups (12 animals each) of infected animals at 5 days and after microbiological isolation the numbers of C. albicans cultures counted.

The immunocompromised state was induced by administering cortisone acetate im twice weekly at a dose of 25 mg/kg over the entire 12 week course of the study. Pneumocystis carinii lung infection was initiated by intranasal instillation on day 0. Prophylactic tetracycline was administered po in the drinking water (500 mg/mL), and peripheral blood differ\u00ad ential counts were monitored over the next 12 weeks. In control (untreated) Pneumocystis-infected animals, differ\u00ad ential counts, body weight, and lymphocyte counts began dropping at about 30-39 days and lung infection was evident histologically by about day 60-69. At day 80, tetracycline treatment was discontinued in all groups. By day 80 in this animal model, mean body weight of the animals had dropped by approximately 30% from the values recorded on day 0. Groups were comprised of 15 rats each. L-Glu-L-Trp treatments were administered according to the following protocol: 10 consecutive daily im injections of 10 gfk.g or 100 gfk.g of L-Glu-L-Trp on days 0 through 9, 30 through 39, and 60 through 69 of the study. Differential cell counts in peripheral blood (TABLE 80) and lung his\u00ad tology (i.e., with enumeration of the number of LI carinii/ 10 microscopic fields\u2014 at 400x magnification) were used to monitor the course of the opportunistic infection.25 30 35peripheral blood leukocytes (i.e., 31% of normal), (i.e., 47% of normal) and neutrophils (i.e., 62% of normal), and resulted in establishment of an opportunistic lung infection. Treatments with L-Glu-L-Trp helped main\u00ad tain leukocyte (i.e., 45M 7% of normal) and lymphocyte counts (i.e., 45% of normal), but not systemic neutrophil counts. Numbers of lung bacteria were reduced by L-Glu- L-Trp treatments at the 10 g/kg and 100 g/kg doses (i.e., to about 33% and 43%, respectively, of the saline treated control Group I). EXAMPLE 43 Stimulation of Anti-Tumor Immunity by Treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp Anti-tumor activity of L-Glu-L-Trp was evaluated CCRF S-180 II) injected at 2x10\u00ae cells/0.1 mL im into each rear flank of Swiss-Webster mice. Groups consisted of 10 animals. L-Glu-L-Trp was administered in a single 0.1 mL dose of either 10 g/kg, 75 gkg, 250 g/kg or 1000 g/kg. Tumor size was evaluated by surgically removing and weighing the affected limbs, and comparing the weight with the weight of normal control (non-tumor) limbs. The first prophylactic drug regimen (PD R-I) consisted of 5 consecutive daily ip injections commencing on day -5 and ending of day - I . The second prophylactic drug regimen (PDR-2) consisted of 5 consecutive daily im injections to the left rear flank (tumor site) beginning on day -5 and ending on day - I . Sarcoma 180 cells were injected im on day 0. Saline 0.1 mL served as the negative control.

Interestingly, it appeared possible to invoke sys\u00ad temic inhibitor effects from treatments delivered at a local 25im site, because the im treatments delivered into the left flank inhibited subsequent tumor growth in the right flank (i.e., groups 8 and 9). The results are consistent with stim ulation of system ic cell-m ediated tumor immune mechanisms. EXAMPLE 44 Stimulation of DTH Sensitization by Treatment with L-Glu-L-Trp Effects of L-Glu-L-Trp treatments on cell mediated 35 immunity were evaluated by testing its effects on induction of a delayed-type hypersensitivity response in two different studies involving sensitization of mice to oxazolone and guinea pigs to tuberculin. In the first study L-Glu-L-Trp was administered ip at a 40 dose of 10 /rg/kg, or 1000 /rg/kg one hour before a sensi\u00ad tizing dose of oxazolone (0.1 mL of a 5% solution) was applied to the abdominal surface of a mouse. Seven days later skin sensitivity was measured by administering 25 /rL of a 2% oxazolone solution to the right mouse ear and a 45 sample of the diluent solution, as a control, to the left ear. Ear thickness was measured at 24 hours using a Dyer Model micrometer. Three groups of 10 animals each were tested and the results are summarized in TABLE 82.

EXAMPLE 45 Effects of L-Glu-L-Trp on Survival in a Model of LPS Shock 50 The LD99 and LD50 values for LPS-induced endotoxic shock (a.k.a. \"septic shock\") were determined in 8 groups of CBAmice (10 animals per group), using a single ip injection of 1-70 mg/kg LPS (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) and recording mortality at 2 hr. intervals from 0 hrs. to 48 55 hrs. The m ortality results w ere evaluated using the Litchfield-Wilcoxon's probit analysis method and a com\u00ad puter program written to conduct probit analyses. Having determined these lethal dose values, a prophylactic test regimen was conducted using L-Glu-L-Trp at doses of 10 60 /rg/kg and 100 /rg/kg ip delivered daily on each of three consecutive days prior to the ip LPS injection, with the last of the 3 injections being 24 hrs. prior to the LPS challenge.

EXAMPLE 46 Preparation of Analogs, Antagonists and Agonists The R'-Glu-Trp-R\" pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of a dipeptide having the general formula R'-X- Tryptophan-R\" or a pharm aceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein X is any naturally-occurring amino acid; and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Generally, X is 30 glutamine, glutamate, leucine, or isoleucine, R' is a free amide, and R\" is a carboxyl, hydroxyl or carbonyl group. Cyclic and polymeric forms of tryptophan- containing dipeptides may also be prepared and tested for activity according to any of the in vitro or in vivo assays 35 identified above. Up to three R'-X-Trp-R\" dipeptide subunits may be joined (e.g., through peptide bonds) to form polymers that can be tested as described above. Polymers having the following formulas are synthesized and tested: X-Trp-Y-Trp, or X-Trp-Y-Trp-Z-Trp, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts \"Y\", and \"Z\" may be any naturally-occurring amino acids. X, Y, and Z may be the same or different amino acids. Generally, at least one of X, Y, and Z will be glutamic acid, glutamine, glutamate, or a derivative or analog thereof. R'-X-Trp-R\" dipeptides and dipeptide polymers may also cyclized and tested. The cyclic forms so synthesized may have I, 2, or 3 dipeptide subunits, e.g., of the general formula X-Trp, X-Trp-Y-Trp, or X-Trp-Y-Trp-Z-Trp or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein X, Y, and Z is any naturally-occurring amino acid.

One illustrative example of a glycerol-phosphatide multimer is provided in 15 Formula III, below, as a phosphatidyl fatty acid of glycerol: H Form ula III \u2014O \u2014 aapaa2\u2014 RiI H \u2014C 2 I fatty a cy l-O \u2014 P \u2014 O \u2014 C \u2014 H I l I O H wherein a first EW dipeptide is depicted and a second EW dipeptide \"aa 3aa4\"; R 1 and R 2 are \"non\u00ad interfering residues.\" The non-interfering residues R 1 and R2 may used to stabilize and/or enhance the biological activity of compound of Formula III. \"Non-interfering resi\u00ad due\" as used herein means any chemical residue that when present in position R 1 or R 6 of Formula II, or position R 1 or R2 of Formula III does not interfere with binding of the subject ligand of the respective formula to a ligand receptor. For example, non-interfering amino acid residues or glyco- syl residues may be useful in positions R 1 and R 6 of Formula I (or positions R 1 or R 2 of Formula III) to stabilize or enhance the biological activity of the synthetic compound. Materials and Methods for Examples 1-45 Staphylococcal strains: Faboratory strains of penicillin- sensitive and -resistant Staphylococci were used in the peritonitis experiments. The resistant strain was methicillin resistant. Penicillin-resistant staphylococcal strain ATCC 33593 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, Bethesda, Md. Antibiotic sensitivity of Staphylococci were determined by doubling-dilution methods with the aid of the semiauto\u00ad matic MIC-2000 system (Dynatech, USA). Indices of humoral immunity (e.g., IgG, IgA, IgM) were 50 determined in accordance with the methods recommended by the World Health Organization in 1976. Indices of cellular immunity were determined in accordance with accepted methods published in the Western scientific literature, and in some cases as translated and modified for 55 use with reagents commonly available in the former Soviet Union. Peripheral blood cell differential cell counts were conducted according to routine methods. Fymphocytes were isolated from heparinized peripheral blood on Ficoll- Hypaque (.077; Ficoll-Paque, Pharmacia, Switzerland) or Ficoll-Urotrast. Total T cells were determined by E-rosette form ation w ith ram erythrocytes, and T-helper and T-suppressor subpopulations were determined using indirect immunofluorescence and monoclonal antibodies OKT4 and OKT 8 (Ortho, USA). B-Iymphocytes were quantitated by EAC-rosetting and surface expression of IgG, IgA, or IgM determined using direct immunofluorescence microscopy156 and monospecific antibodies (Sevas, Czechoslovakia, (former)). Immunoglobulin (IgG, IgA, and IgM) and C3 concentrations in peripheral blood were determined using radial immunodiffusion in agarose and using and phagocytic index (number of bacteria per cell) was determined using S. aureus strain Oxford 209P. Natural Killer (NK) lymphocyte activity was determined at a E:T (effector:target) with 3Uridine labeled MIF cytokine was measured in vitro using a modification of the method described in \"Evaluation of the Body's Immune Status in Therapeutic Institutions of the Soviet Army and Navy\", Ministry of Defense, U.S.S.R., Center of Military Medicine, 1987 (F. A. Kozhemia, ed). MIF production was measured following stimulation of Ficoll-Hypaque-purified lymphocytes with mitogens, i.e., Kazanskii, SRI of Epidemiology and Microbiology, U.S.S.R.). Peripheral Blood and Serum Samples: Patient and animal samples of peripheral blood were collected into heparin and serum was obtained from separate blood samples collected 25 and clotted in glass tubes. Thymus, Fymph Node, Bone M arrow and Spleen Samples: Thymus, left paratracheal lymph node, and spleen were surgically removed, weighed, and homogenized in a glass Dounce homogenizer in Medium 199. Tissue frag- 3q ments were removed by filtration through a chaperon. Bone marrow cell suspensions were prepared by irrigating the bone marrow canal of the pelvis with Medium 199 and homogenizing the irrigated solution. Suspensions from the different respective sources were purified by centrifuging the 35 different cell samples on different aliquots of 67 1.077 Ficoll-Urotrast for 40 minutes at 1500-1800 rpm. The lymphocyte interfaces from the gradients were collected into a siliconized test tube and washed in Medium 199. Residual red cells in the lymphocyte suspensions were lysed using 3% 4q acetic acid in the presence of 0.05% Hessian-violet as a viability marker. Cell concentrations were determined microscopically using a Goryaev counting chamber. Cell concentrations were adjusted to 2 .5 x l0 6/mF. Differential Cell Counts: Differential cell counts were 45 performed by lysing erythrocytes in peripheral blood with 3% acetic acid, washing, and preparing smears of cells on a slide. After air-drying the cells in the smear were stained using the method of Romanovsky-Geimsa. Percentages of the different cell types were determined by counting a minimum of 1 0 0 cells in each sample. Fymphocyte Preparations: Fymphocytes were prepared by density gradient centrifugation on Ficoll-Urotrast (Pharmacia). E-RFC: Ram erythrocytes (E) were washed 4x in saline (2 0 0 0 rpm /1 0 min.) and suspended at a final concentration of 1% in Medium 199. For determinations of the percentage of E-rosette forming T-Iymphocytes (E-RFC) in a sample, 0.1 mL of a prepared lymphocyte suspension (2.5xl0 6/ml) was incubated with 0.1 mL of the 1% ram erythrocyte 60 suspension at 37\u00b0 C. for 10 min., centrifuged at 800-1000 rpm for 5 min., maintained at 4\u00b0 C. for 2 hrs., and finally resuspended and counted in a Goryaev chamber. Activated T-Iymphocytes (i.e., having increased E-RFC capacity) were determined by mixing the test lymphocyte suspension with 65 E, immediately centrifuging for 5 min. at 800-1000 rpm, resuspending the cells and counting the rosettes formed in a Goryaev chamber. 5,807,830 157 EA-RFC: Antibody-coated rabbit erythrocytes were used for d e te rm in a tio n s o f E A -R F C (i.e ., \" a c tiv a te d \" T-lymphocytes) according to the method of Stadecker, M. J., et al., J. Immunol. ff(6 ):i8 3 4 -i8 3 with an optimal dilution of anti- 5 rabbit IgG, washed, and prepared as a 1% cell suspension in a manner analogous to those above (E-RFC, supra). EA-RFC assays were performed in a manner analogous to the description above, i.e., E-RFC, supra.

Ortho OKT monoclonal anti\u00ad bodies according to the manufacturers instructions), and a direct fluorescence microscope equipped with phase contrast optics, employed. Cells having \"ring\" or \"point\" lumines\u00ad cence were counted. Diffuse staining was not counted. Determinations of the percentages of T- and B-lymphocytes were made by counting a minimum of 200-300 cells. Blastogenesis with PFlA and Con-A: Lymphocyte blas- togenic responsiveness to mitogens was evaluated using the method of Bach, J. F., et al., Proc. Ann. Leukocyte Culture 2s Conf. determ ined according to a modification of Bendixsen, G. et al. 1980 by: i) adding Concanavalin-A to a sample of a patient's heparinized blood (25 units/ml 30 heparin) to achieve a final concentration of 80 /rg/ml Con-A; ii) collecting 200 \\ of the Con-A-heparinized blood into a smooth bore heparinized glass capillary tube; iii) sealing one end of the capillary tube with paraffin or plastylene; iv) centrifuging the capillary for 5 minutes at 1500-2000 rpm; 35 v) incubating the capillary tube for 18-24 hrs. at 37\u00b0 C. in tissue culture medium in a vertical orientation; vi) deter\u00ad mining the diameter of the zone of leukocyte migration at the border of the erythrocyte mass using an ocular microme\u00ad ter; and, vii) subtracting from the recorded values the 40 migration area in control samples (i.e., packed blood lacking Con-A). The calculation of LMIR % was as follows: Migration inhibition (LMIR) %=diameter of the migra\u00ad tion zone in the presence of Con-A/diameter of the migration zone in the absence of Con-A X 100%. 45 Three capillary tubes were used for each determination, and the mean of the values recorded in the determinations \u00b1S.D. are presented above. degranulation in proteases (and cationic permeability of neutrophil vation of the hexose and formation peroxide in lysosomes. Neutrophil cationic pro- 55 teins are a measure the activation state of neutrophils and levels of these proteins are correlated with the level of non-specific resistance to infection in an animal (or man). To determine neutrophil cationic proteins, briefly, blood smears were air dried, stained for 2 0 minutes in a buffered 60 methanol-fast green solution, washed in distilled water, and stained for an additional 30 minutes with Azure 11. The percentage of cells containing green-colored granules was determined by microscopically counting a minimum of 100-200 of the cells in the smears, and cation protein 65 concentration was recorded as the mean cytotoxic coefficient (MCC) according to a modified formula of Astold Berg.158 Immunoglobulins and Acute Phase Reactant Protein Lev\u00ad els: Concentrations of IgG, IgM and IgA and acute phase reactant proteins (e.g., a 2-macroglobulin, orosomucoid, prealbumin, etc.) in serum were determined by radial immu\u00ad nodiffusion in agarose according to the method of Mancini (1965).
