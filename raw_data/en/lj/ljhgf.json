Phegley said UCSD is supponive of the eastern Mation because such a station lits into the university's long\u00ad range development plan and will potentially serve the campus well. \"The university very much would like to see a trolley station on campus.\" Phegley said, also noting that MTDB foots the hill for the rail line and makes the linal decision. Wahl said that choosing a sta\u00ad tion location is also dependent upon potential ridership -how many people live and work within the area of the station site. He said MTDB projects that 10,000 to 11.000 people will ride the trolley daily hetween the ruture Balboa Avenue station and UCSD.

Yet for othl!rs. visions of living among the same 15.0()() people for four years is unbearably st;' ning. In an effort to cater to the needs of a diver~e number of students, UCSD has developed a system that provides the excellent communal atmosphere of a small college. while dwelling within a hotbed of a large-scale research universi\u00ad ty. UCSD's live-college system allows students to have choices concerning the kind of education and atmosphere they desire. It ctTcctilLCly tits the needs of such a largc ,tudent body by providing hoth ~ma ll-schoo l large -~chool opportunities. In addition, UCSD', five-college ~ystem provides specific VISIOns ror students and researchers to direct their elTOrls. Because of this systcm. more opportuni\u00ad tics arc made availahle and .. we goals are acwmphshed. From this combination of large-and small-school advantages emerges an array of choice~ for the UCSD student. Independent learners can be a part or the larger UCSD. with their college just being a check in a box on their tran\u00ad ~aipts. while those who thrive on per\u00ad somll attention can have lunch with tbeir provost once a month if they want. Students have the comfort of belonging to a small college with a specilil: vision. but they arc a part of a larger university comll1unity that ranks among the top in (he world. The live-COllege system offers options that both small and large colleges do not. For this reason, attending UCSD entails n:ceiving the best of both worlds. The lirst benclit of the college system is the advantage of being oriented within a small collegc. Students reap the benefits of having their provost greet them when they move in. having the option of partic\u00ad ipating in college politics and activities on a small scale and being able to know peo\u00ad ple at the administrative level by their lirst name. The colleges form a uniform com\u00ad monality among their constituents. For many who would otherwise not have anything in common. the colleges offer similar curriculum, housing arrange\u00ad Inents and eating facilities. These fea\u00ad tureS push students into forming relation\u00ad ships with one another. Warren College Provost David Jordan says these wmmonalitie s help facilitate \"an intellectual interchange with other students,\" which forms communities that are the basis for the college experience . At each college. students can ellist within the enclave of communities that arc commilted to particular visions. In choo~ing a college. students can pick a system of general education that best tits their needs. Thurgood Marshall Provqst Cecil Lytle said that the different general education requirements allow students to choose different ways in which to diver\u00ad sify their tields of study and provide maximum opportunities to develop their own interests and abilities. But after all this, students will realize one of the reasons they ebose to attend UCSD. While these perks of the smail-col\u00ad lege system can be helpful. to some tbey can also be limiting. Therefore. another benelit of UCSD's system is that students can operate on a more global, university scale if they so choose. Outside the five\u00ad college system, the larger spectrum of UCSD offers clubs. sororities, fraternities, politics, intramural sports and facilities that incorporate all tive colleges. The sys\u00ad tem is not segregated only into little clubs. rather, it offers options for students. This option of being involved on a larger scale is also facilitated hy the inte\u00ad gration of all students in the same class\u00ad es. While a few general education class\u00ad es remain separated along the lines of college, all other classes include students from all five colleges. Altending UCSD also means being a part of a major research university, which entails more opportunities for students. as well as simply being a part, even if by association. of research that is changing See UNITED, Page 6 Monday. April 19. 1999 The UCSD Guardian OPINION 5 JORDAN LOSES SIGHT OF RESPONSIBILITIES Editor: In light of the signilicanc e of commencement to graduating eniors, perhaps ihe admilledly ambivalent David Jordan, provost of Warren College, made a terrihly unwise decision to accept an invita\u00ad tion to take part in the commence \u00ad ment speaker comminet! . He mentions fiscal responsibil\u00ad ity and limited access as reasons for his ambivalence over, \"big, fancy speakers\" during com\u00ad mencement (\"All-Camp us Graduation Canceled ,\" April 12). Here's the nicest way I can put this: \u00b7Perhaps he's lost sight of who graduation ceremonies are there to service. I always thought they were for seniors and their families. It certainly does not exclude all students from hearing a big. fancy speaker. all they have to do is go to class for four years, work hard, satisfy ul)iversity requirements and earn -their degree. Then they too have earned the right to hear a big. fancy speaker. It may not be the one I would have heard. but they hear STUDENT DISCOUNT ~W~ ANY PURCHASE w!UC8D ID 7770 Regents Road .......... www.statravel.com from one nonetheless . As fiscal responsibility goes. certa:nly concur with the statement that speakers are expensive , hut where would Jordan have us spend the money'! I enjoy a good comedi\u00ad an like anyone else. but I'm sure the recent visit of Carrot Top was not cheap, or maybe he should speak at graduation , he's clearly in our price range. Let me, a graduating senior, provide Jordan with a taste of real\u00ad ity. So what if the commencement speaker commillee hinders the process of pUlling together the cer\u00ad emony, or that it is difficult to act quickly. Unless the commillee caused irreparable damage to the process, which I certainly didn't hear in the article, perhaps it's time he stopped shirking responsibility , accept the failure of the commillee and apologize to the graduating class of 1999 who wi II miss the opportunity to hear from a speaker at an all-campus event on the day of its graduation. Jordan is certainly not the sole reason for the commillee's failure. / Letters t~g Editor The Guardian welcomes letters from its readers.

Barry Taylor Donors Should Know Where Money Goes Editor: Recently a group of well-inten\u00ad tioned students organized a tahk on Lihrary Walk to help raise money for Kosovar refugees. Throughout the selling of h;lgels. juice and like, the students who were fund-raising failed In mention who exactly would he receiving the money. When stating \"Kosovo Refugees,\" many assume ethnic Alhanians and others forcihly dis\u00ad placed. But. the majority of the money raised will not he going to the Kosovars -ethnic Alhanians. Instead, Serhs will also he receiv\u00ad ing the funds. This is not to imply that there are no Serh victims. but misrepresenting the goal of the fund-raising effort is what is objectionable . The campus failed to realize that the money would be divided between Albanians and Serbians as well. Only when asked about the destination .01' the donations. a I\\:w members of this group informed us that the money was not intended for Kosovar refugees alone. Apparently. these e-mails and signs composed by the group were miskading hecause neither one mentioned sudl a distinction. As a means for awareness and prevention. it is imperative that students. fawlty and staff take responsihility to ensure the legitimacy of the relic!' organization and fair delivery of this aid to actual victims. The word \"rcl'ugee\" represents people taking sanctuary (refuge) in another land hecause they have been fon:ibly displaced (cleansed) out of their original home. And in this case it is clear that only the ethnic Alhanians have been tur.ned into refugees by the atrocities of the Serbs. Students who an: thinking abuut donating money have the right to clearly understand where their money is going and then decide for themselves .

Our campus is so spread out as it is. and this system only perpetu\u00ad ates the problem by making it seem as if there are live different cam\u00ad puses within a close vicinity. Being comprised of five colleges, UCSD not only distances the student body, but it creates a costly bureau\u00ad cratic network of crisscrossing wires that discourages even tbe most ambi\u00ad tious students. Simple tasks, such as changing majors or adding a 199 course. involve 18 phone calls, 27 signatures and no less than three trips to the various. corresponding departments to complete. In addition, the cost of running a live-college system is exorbitant. Marshall College alone has its own provost. dean, assistant dean, resident dean, assistant resident de.tn. academ\u00ad ic advisors, directors. receptionists. secretaries and other 'upporting staff. Multiply that by live. add the all-cam\u00ad pus staff and you've got about twice as Illany administra ters as needed. All of these divisions add up to a costly, convoluted bureaucrdcy. \"While the college system has its benefits,\" said A.S. President Joe Leventhal, \"I believe that our current structure should be modified to ave costs for students. Running five completely independent colleges proves to be extremely expensive, and it could save students money if some resources were consolidated.\" ow, UCSD is not planning an all-campu s commencement for the graduating class of 1999, which will further isolate students from differ\u00ad ent colleges. The excuse is that we could not attract anyone comparable enough to the past two year's speak\u00ad ers. TIle ceremony was called off because we could not attract a big name. Who cares? The only people who wi II be punished for the admin\u00ad istration's snobbery arc the students. The outcome of this decision will further separate the student body. \"So what if we can't get another Clinton or ewt,\" said graduating senior Gabriela Santis. \"Anybody will do if the purpose is to unite the graduating students in their cele\u00ad bration. Students are completely disillusioned with the message the university is sending out.\" One solution to th~ problem of disunity would be to convert UCSD to a one-college university. We could lump all live colleges together into one campus where students\u00b7 could bave a better chance of interacting with one anotber. Instead of being concemed witll college requirements or college activities. students could spend more time focusing on their role in the university.

Some student say one of the perks of anending UCSD is that they have the option of being part of a smaller, 3,OOO-member insti\u00ad tution. but wben they get tired of seeing the same faces over and over again, there are four more colleges full of new people. The primary benefits of belonging to a small college are in this membership of sorts to a sys\u00ad tcm that has live sets of adminis\u00ad tration whose goal it is to serve its students. For example, if an opin\u00ad ion writer is to send out a few e\u00ad mails one day, the next day shc could walk into her provost's orrice for an on-the-spot inter\u00ad view, and then later that day she could receive a personal phone call from another college provost. The kind of per. onal anent ion that is made possible by UCSD's tive\u00ad college system allows for a more effective system for students to shape and choose the path their education is to take in the future. While some may say that the college system makes students too segregated, the truth is that because of integrated classes, clubs, sports and activities, students will only be segregated if tbey never leave their donn rooms. Although. lirst-and second-year students tend to be somewhat segregated because of classes and living arrangements, in the later years, college lines tend to dissolve because the features that Kaplan students get into Law School.

However, living in college enclaves during the first and sometimes second year of college is more helpful than inhibiting because it creates a more personal. community of people who all have something in eommon. It creates a less intimidating environment, yet still leaves students with the option of expanding their social activities to 12,000 other people if tbey so desi reo In looking at the big picture, it is obvious that the benefits of small-college opportunities great\u00ad ly outweigh any separation anxi\u00ad 'ety one might have for living in a vicinity different than his or her c.tlculus group members. Regardless of how independent a learner one is, small-college com\u00ad munities benefit the learning experience in several ways. First, allocating specific academic advising programs , deans and provosts for each college gives each student's education a higher priority in a system of 3,000 stu-Monday, April 19,1999 dents, rather than being a random file in a system of 15,000 students. Second, students have the choice of picking a general-educa\u00ad tion trac.k that best fits their needs. Without the college system, Warren COUld. never have fewer writing requirements for people who would rather spend their time in a science course and Marshall eould never impose stricter requirements for those who. want to be multiculturally educated. As Provost Jordan says, the colleges allow students to be part of a \"dis\u00ad tinctive package that could not exist if there were not other options to choose from.\" The college system also allows for specific visions that ,!,ould never exist otherwise. Because the colleges have their own missions and distinctive theories of higher education, they are more able to facilitate change in particular directions according to their goals. We would not have such a inlluen\u00ad tial and promising environmental studies major if it were not for the efforts of John Muir College, and without the goals and directives of Thurgood Marshall College, there would be no plan to develop the Preuss School -a model school that will reach down into the edu\u00ad cation system to facilitate change. Just as Marshall Provost Lytle said, it is because of the missions of each college that change can be pursued in specific directions. These missions \"provide vision\u00ad ary instruments that look over the horizon\" in leadership , research and edueation .

PHOTO BY PRIVATE CHRISTOPHER IIAWN!! Monday, April 19, 1999 An evaluation of the history and issues surrounding the debate over a woman's right to choose STORY BY JESYKA AsHLAR. SPECIAL TO THE CUARDIAN & JESSICA SCHEPPMANN, FEATURES EDITOR The UCSD Guardian ew debates in the United States arc more explosive than thosc surrounding abortion. For many people, the political stance they take is based on their moral and religious beliefs regarding protec\u00ad tion of an unborn life. Others hclieve that the right to choose is a fundamental part of this country's heritage and is crucial to women's rights and their ahil\u00ad ity to achieve social equality. Often these opinions arc rooted in uncompromising political heliefs. The central debate focuses around separate, hut related, issues. On one hand, many argue t.hat life begins at conception, On the other hand, hecausc of Ihe burdens of reproduction , some argue that women's right to choose is crucial to the advanccment of women as equal. These two i~sues add up to the ideologies behind pro-life and pro-choice positions. A 1989 LO.f Allxeles 7illles national opinion poll reported that although 61 percent of Americans think abortion is morally wrong and 57 pcrcentthink it is mur\u00ad der, 74 percent helieve that ','ahortion is a decision that has to be made hy every woman for herself,\" reflecting the ditliculty and contlicting emotional nature of the abortion dehate. This shows that many American 's arc pro-choice, wit trout necessarily sharing the view that you have to have an ahortion to believc in the funda\u00ad mental right to determine your own reproductive path\u00ad way. A NC'II' York 7i1llC'.\\,/CBS Yl!ars. Early feminists, such as Elizahclh Cady Stanton, Su~an B. Anthony, and Dr. Alice Bunker Stockham were staum:hly pro-life, argu\u00ad ing thai ahortion allowed for the exploitation of women and children. They felt Ihat ahortion primarily served the needs of the \"predatory\" nature of men. Stanton wrote, in July of I X69, \"Guilty'! Yes, no matter what the motive, love of case, or a desire to save from suffering the unhorn innocent, Ihe woman is awfully guilty who wmmits the deed. It will hurden her consciem:e in life. it will hurden her soul in death; hut oh! thrice guilty is he who, for sellish gratitkation , heedless of her prayers, indifferent to her fate, drove her to the desperation which impels her crime.\" According to Ian Shapiro. editor of Abortioll: Till' SuprelllC' Court /)('ci,\\\u00b7ioll.\\\u00b7, the issue over the legality of uhortions in the United Slates nccame controversial , not when the women's movement took a slance, hut when middk-dass singk and married white women hegan to seck out ahortions in order to alleviate thl! hurden of child rearing in the middle of centu\u00ad ry.

Other arguments focused on the health of the mother because abortions put women in dan\u00adCALIFORNIA STATE ger. Abortion had his\u00ad torically heen a proce\u00ad dure that led to infection, sterility or death. However, as noted in Justice Blackman's Roe v. Wade opinion. by 1973. med\u00ad ical advancements made it safer for a woman to have an abortion than to carry a fetus to term. Currently, the right to choose to have an ahortion is primarily consid\u00ad ered a feminist issue. The National Organization for Women (NOW) has designated the preservation of a woman's right to choose as its top pri\u00ad ority. Additionally , Planned Parent\u00ad hood focuses on the rights and the health of women and their reproduc\u00ad tive capabilities. Often the first orga\u00ad nization to come to mind for the pro\u00ad choice movement it, \"Believes in the fundamental right of each individual to manage his or her fertility.\" Its wish for \"every child [to bel a loved and wanted child\" is central to pro\u00ad choice declaration s. The fac\\. that only 5.8 percent of Planned Parenthood 's services are dedicated to abortion often comes as a surprise. The majority of its resources are dedicated to pro\u00ad viding contraceptive s, preg- nancy tests, and prenatal care to women. DefInition The debate over sexual educa\u00ad tion in schools serves as another facel of this heated argument. A National Abortion Federation (NAF) Fact Sheet defines abortion as \"the expUlsion of a fetus before it is mature enough to live on its own,\" and adds that. \"legal induced abortion WHEN\u00b7Do WOMEN HAVE ABO~TIONS? 7-8 weeks 21 or more weeks (1%) 16-20 weeks 13-IS weeks 88% of abortions occur in the fi rst I 2 weeks of pregnancy. According to a New York Times/Cas poll coinciding with the 25th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, about 1/1 of American adults believe that abortion should be legal in the first trimester of pregnancy.

Casey, the Supreme Court defined viability as, \"The time at which there is a real\u00ad istic pos!>ibility of maintaining and nourishing a life out ide the womb.\" Planned Parenthood 's information states that a fetus is viable when it reaches an, \"anatomical threshold.\" This means that when critical organs, such as the lungs and kidneys, can sustain independent life outside the uterus, then the fetus is considered viable. It is extremely unlikely that a fetus wi II be viable outside of the womb until at least 23 weeks of ges\u00ad tation. There are those who consider this viability to be the line between a fetus and a life. Statistics on Occurrence Currently , according to the CALIFORNIA STATE NAF, 90 percent of women who obtain abortions do so in the first trimester (less than 13 weeks of preg\u00ad nancy). Of these women, 97 percent have no com\u00ad plications, 2.5 percent have minor complication s that can be handled in a doctor's office, and less than .5 percent require some additional surgical procedure or hos\u00ad pitalization. According to Planned Parenthood, 9 percent of abortions are performed in the second trimester, (24 or fewer weeks of gestation), and only about 100 are performed in the third trimester, or approximately .01 per\u00ad cent of all abortions performed . These take place when the health of the mother is threatened , especially in the case of cancer, when treatment would not be able to tale place during the pregnancy . In terms of the abortion procedure , a significant factor that contribute s to a safe abortion is how far along the pregnancy is. The farther into the pregnancy. the higher the risk, although current methods are rela\u00ad tively safe. Other factors involve the skill of the physician, the kind of anesthesia used, the woman's health and the abortion method used. TheDelNde According to' Kristin Luker, the abortion debate can be broken down to \"a debate about personhood. \" The abortion debate falls into two comers: pro-life and pro-choice . Pro\u00ad life advocates believe that life begins at conception . From this premise, they argue that abortion is the murder of a human life and that to end the course of that life is immoral and wrong. Many times, this belief is tied to religious convictions . \"It is doubtful whether statistics can establish a particular moral posi\u00ad tion,\" said Frank Beck'with, a pro-life doctor, reinforcing the grounds that the pro-life argument is based in The turning point in this century over the legality of abortion came with the Supreme Court's landmark decision in 1973 with Roe v. Wade. moral beliefs rather than statistical facts. When the mother is a victim of incest or rape, or when the mother's life is in danger, pro-life opposition to a legal abortion is often religiously motivated . Because the center of the pro-life argument focuses on certain religious or spiritual premises, there are those who consider efforts to legislate on the basis of faith a violation of the separation of Church and state. However, there are those who pursue the argument based on biological reasons. \"I can explain, in biologi\u00ad cal terms, why life begins at conception,\" Allie LeBlanc, a pro-life Christian, said. \"However, my pol i tic a I beliefs on this matter are also closely tied to my religious beliefs.\" Those focused on the question of when life begins from a pro-choice persptX:tive often consider fetal viabil\u00ad ity to be the point at which the unborn takes precedence over the mother, except in certain extreme situations . Statistics vary on the actual num\u00ad ber of women's deaths related to abortion, legal or illegal. However, according to the NAF, only one in 200,000 women die during legal abortions, and seven out of 200.000 die during childbirth . The number of deaths from legal abortions now is only a small fraction of those that occurred from illegal abortions prior to 1973. These statistics coincide with Planned Parenthood statistics, which are gathered by an independent research institute, the Alan Guttmach \u00ad er Institute. The Guttmacher Report, published last February, reports that approxi\u00ad mately half of all abortions are per\u00ad formed in the first eight weeks of pregnancy and almost nine out of 10 abortions are done in the first trimester. Planned Parenthood's research on abortion shows that 70 percent of women who obtain an abortion failed to use contraceptives before their pro\u00ad cedure, but only 6 percent continue to not use birth control afterward. This helps to motivate the organization's concentrated effort to educate women and men of all ages about contracep \u00ad tion, sexual health and family plan\u00ad ning. The decision to have a baby is dif-lieu It, and the opinions of others are often hard to avoid. Kelly Oscar, a pro-choice woman who has chosen to have her baby, says that in many of her meetings with state health providers she tinds herself the recipi\u00ad ent of graphic pro-life literature and is often lectured by state care providers. \"I want them to keep their politics off of my body,\" Oscar said. \"They don't even understand that the comments they make are political.\" TIle Centnli C .... The turning point in this cen\u00ad tury over the legality of abortion came with the Supreme Court's landmark deci\u00ad sion in 1973 with Roe v. Wade. The findings of this case were three -old. \"For the stage prior to approxi\u00ad mately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectua\u00ad tion must be left to the medical judg\u00ad ment of the pregnant woman's attend\u00ad ing physician. \"For the stage. subsequent to approximately the end of the !irst trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother. may, if it chooses, regulate the abor\u00ad tion procedure in ways that are rea\u00b7 sonably related to maternal health. I \"For the stage subsequent to via\u00ad bility, the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and ------------------------even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the health of the mother.\" Doe v. Boulton, a companion suit to Roe v. Wade, made it illegal to deny an abortion based on the decision of a hospital committee . More important\u00ad ly, however, this case struck down legislative restrictions that had been placed on where a woman could have an abortion. This gave rise to the evo\u00ad lution of the modem abortion clinic. Planned Parenthood v. Casey, was a crucial case to the Supreme Court in deciding whether or not Roe v. Wade was still a deciding factor. Casey established that the Roe holding should be upheld and reaffirmed, and that the state's interest in protecting an unborn life would be seen as ub- pregnant woman. ordinate to a woman's con\u00ad stitutionally protected right to an abortion. This decision allowed states to regulate or ban abortion after viability unless necessary to protect the life or health of the In the 1979 ColaUlti v. Franklin decision, the Supreme Court ruled that viability must be determined by \"the judgment of the attending physi\u00ad cian on the particular facts of the case before him.\" This denies any attempts to place a universal time line on abor-tion eligibility. TIle CoM \"-C-\"\"'\" Many recognize the use of the coat hanger as a symbol of the pro-choice movement , referencing a time when the illegality of abortions is said to have forced women to resort to coat hangers or \"back street butchers\" for dangerous or lethal abortions. Beck\u00ad with quotes a 1960 American Journal of Health article showing that 84 to 87 percent of illegal abortions in 1958 \"were performed by licensed physi\u00ad cians in good standing.\" He also lis t s instances of contra\u00ad dictory reporting of illegal abor\u00ad tion deaths that reveal an under-report\u00ad ing of them. These contradic- tion undermine statistical attempts to accurately project the ramifications of undermining Roe v. Wade and a return to those condition s. It is difficult, however, to claim that prior to 1973. there were not consider\u00ad ably more deaths and injury sustained by women from dangerous illegal abortions. or from attempting to induce a miscarriage . According to a NAF fact sheet, women undergoing illegal abortions often ended up in the emergency room with medical compli\u00ad cations such as a perforated uterus. retained placenta, severe bleeding, cer\u00ad vical wounds. rampant infection, shock and gangrene, sometimes result- Car Accidellft Free Report uncovers information that the insurance company hopes you don't discover: Call (800) 838-6319 24-hour recorded message to order your FREE REPORT Monday, April 19, 1999 ing in permanent infertility or death. ...... CIIMIoIIs Abortion affects each individual differently, which is reflected in the current political debate. Despite all of the controversy , Planned Parent\u00ad hood's statistics show that 98 percent of women who have abortions express almost no regret. Obviously , factors contributing to this include personal religious beliefs and her decision making process. Statistics also show thut 70 percent of relation ships end within one month of an abor\u00ad tion. According to a Planned Parenthood fact sheet, more than 70 pereent of women who choose abortion plan to choose motherhood in the future.

I'd known him for several months ... long enough to know he was (how to put this deli\u00ad cately'!) a big, bad wolf, vastly experienced with nocturnal recre\u00ad ation. I, being pure and chaste, held him in the highest regard. We settled in for the night, on our re pective sides of the bed. Although he didn't immediate ly lunge at me, he wasn't the type of guy to pass up a night of meaning\u00ad less passion (I thought hopefully). I had certai n ideas about how a frat feci the rise and fall of his chest as he breathed deeply. I whispered his name. Then 1 heard the low, throaty rumble of his snoring. I was not deterred ... Ii rst I nudged his shoulder, then I kicked his leg, but it was all for naught. Disappointed, 1 realized I was to leave the hotel room the next mom\u00ad ing untouched. Dammit. So much for basking in the hap\u00ad pily ever afterglow. Needless to say, this spawned all sorts of inse-like so many others I fell into the 'everything but' category. Up until the Baja incident, my abstinence was purposeful. Being a hard-core romantic, I figured I'd wait until I got married. Or at least until I fell in love. Or at least until I found a somewhat attractive guy who did\u00ad n't annoy me too much. All around me my virgin friends were dropping like flies, or so it seemed. Despite my inaccurate impression that the entire living, breathing world was having sex, I experience with someone special. Having been raised on a strict diet ofTY and trashy romance novels, I had certain ideas about what sex should be: intimate, tender, memo\u00ad rable. (Have you ever noticed that on TY they always call it \"making love?\" It's never. \"Hey, what's up? You wanna do itT') These romantic ideals were impossible to eradicate, no matter how hard I tried. Later that year a sympathetic (and admittedly horny) male friend actually offered to have mercy sex with me, but I declined. I waited. And waited. ote To Reader: I'm about to devote this entire column to forni\u00ad cation. If you're easily offended or have heart problems, skip on over to the Sports section. Time: About three years ago. Place: Somewhere in Mexico. This is the story of the Little, Red Writing Ho (before she became the Psycho Therapist ). Once upon a time, 1 was shacked up in a Baja hotel room with a frat boy, a double bed and enough alco\u00ad hol to stun a rhinoceros. There was only one minor inconvenience - the presence of a third party -but he was unconscious in the next bed over and not likely to wake so long a the noise (ahem) was kept to a minimum. I was not deterred ... first I nudged his shoulder, then I kicked his leg, but it was all for naught. Dis\u00ad appOinted , I realized I was to leave the hotel room the next morning untouched. Dammit. Let me get to the point ... even\u00ad tually I had sex. This is embarrass\u00ad ing to admit in the school paper not because it's all that shocking but because (a) it feels like \"kissing and telling\" and (b) my parents sometimes read the Guardian and I'm sure this is information thl:y'd rather not know. Beer bottles littered the floor. I was the only female within arm's reach. Ah yes, it was the perfect setting to finally satisfy my curios\u00ad ity about that oh-so-enticing world of SEX. The lights went out and the aforementioned frat hoy and I hit the sack. fully clothed (hut not for boy should behave, so I figured I wouldn't have to beg too hard. everal minutes later, I still waited for him to make a move but nothing happened.

I was 19 and a virgin, though not completely innocent ... didn't feel any pressure to join in. I waited patiently for Mr. Right. It's funny how all my ideals sort of fell by the wayside when I got to col\u00ad lege. J got tired of waiting. I was curious. I was eager. I was sur\u00ad rounded by thousands of guys who had no moral values whatsoever. Things looked promising . Yet despite my frustration after the Baja debacle, I was relieved nothing had happened. For one thing, it would have been terribly embarrassing if the third party had just been pretending to sleep. Also, I realized I wanted to share my first So why am I writing this'? I fig\u00ad ure my parents will at least feel comfort that our \"little talk\" wasn't for nothing. As for the kissing and telling, sex is an important and seri\u00ad ous topic (even though I joke about it) and I think it's worth a little press. In our culture, we are obsessive\u00ad ly preoccupied with sex but we never really talk about it in a mean\u00ad ingful way.

I told my mom that I wanted to be eight years old\u00b7forev\u00ad er. She asked me why and I said that I never wanted to grow up. She later told me that it was at that moment that she figured out two things about me. The first was that I was wise beyond my years. The second was that I was also some\u00ad how really immature for my age, which leads us to today. I am a big, fat senior and I still never want to grow up. Now hold on, Felicity, this is not going to be another sappy, \"senior\" soapbox, complete with whiny, sentimental musings and a conclu\u00ad sion full of whimsical happiness about the past and a positive out\u00ad look on the future (and that horrifi\u00ad cally happy music that comes on at the end of every WB show and Jen\u00ad nifer Love Hewitt project). For those of you readers who know who I am, you know that will never happen. For Ihose of you who don't have enough guts to read the sports section. let me fill you in: I am the antithesis of the typical lJCSQ SWdent. 1 am not here ~o become some freakish lab-rat that never sees the light of day.

I am hcre to have four of the hest years of my life, which includes a lot of sports, alcohol and most importantly. fun. Fun has pretty much been my motivation ever since I've been here. Most of the \"smart\" people here would assail me for being a \"stupid\" Communication major, but I'm the one who's going to bars on Tues\u00ad day nights and spending entire afternoons in the sun while they're fighting to find a good table at the library. Oh yeah, I'm also really good at digressing and taking a really long time to make my point. but don't worry, it's an interesting ride at the very least. So. Qack to the point of this lop that I call a soapbox: me being a senior. Being a senior is absolutely the greatest thing that can happen to a college kid. It basically includes all the fun stuff that you always want to do while you're rot\u00ad ting away in class, without the bor\u00ad ing filler, like class! I am having such a great time this year. I'm not kidding kids, I am now a \"good time\" junkie. My entire existence consists of search\u00ad ing for the next new adventure. I don't care what it is, ['m ready. Bring me any dumb idea that sounds cool. and I'm there. It's on. How serious am I about seeking out merrimenl\" !

That's when I had a moment of . clarity. I realized that class had truly taken a back seat to just about everything in my life. For those who know me, they know that that should not have some kind of monumentous deci\u00ad sion. I have never gone to class. Honestly, I was never the most ardent of students. I was always ready to be fat and lazy instead of going to class. There have been times when I'm walking into the door of a 25-I*son ~Ias~ and just decided that I wanted to go to the Padre game instead, so I just turned around and left. But now, class has taken a back\u00ad seat even hy my standards, which is scary because they are prctty damn low. But I can rationalize my apathy by figuring that it's all worth it because I'm out of here in about seven weeks. But here is where I have my big problem. Being a senior would be the closest thing to heaven if it wasn't for thc finality of it all. In seven weeks I have to become a \"real\" person. Everyone says that once I graduat~ that I have to grow up. Weill say that sucks! It's taken me almost four years to perfect being a college student and now that I have finally figured a way to truly put class on the back burner, I have to leave soon. What a rip-off! Basically what I'm saying is that [ don't want to leave college, but I don't want to have class either. 1 ju t want to be a senior for\u00ad ever. I'm sure my view is different from a lot of other seniors. I know a lot of people who are ready to get the hell out of Dodge. In other words, the faster they can grab their diploma, the better. I don't know, I just don't get that. Why do you want to grow up? [ don't see the fun of dealing with the bills, bureaucra\u00ad cy and boredom of the real world. Half of the people who are graduat\u00ad ing are doomed to 40 years of cubi\u00ad cle hell! I don't know, I guess I'm just kind of weird for wanting to stay in a world of parties, intramur\u00ad al sports and the ability to take the afternoon off at any time. Of course, the response to my argument is simple reality: Coach! You fat sloth! It is impossible to be hcre forever. Being a senior is not a profession! OK, I know that argument. 1 am not so jaded that 1 have not taken fac:s like that into account (['m rcal close, though). Let mc say this: I would rather be a middle class journalist that can work from home and travel a lot than sit in a lah or a cubiclc for 40 hours a week. Now, however, [ have come to a new realization. I have figured out a kind of middle ground. I am going to ditch Plan A. which was to just fail all my classes this quarter and Slay for a couple more. My new plan is to allow myself to graduate, then find some fifth-year students to live with. As for money, I will live off of the cash I get for graduation as long as I can, then I'll probably go the 'starving writer who is a little down on his luck but is strangely irresistible' route. That way, I can still live the stu\u00ad dent life, with no class. Which is all [ want in the first place. Now if [ can just convince someone that that is a marketable skill, I will truly never grow up. (No, Peter Pan jokes are not funny here.)

Sometimes my friends who have chosen to abstain ask me what it was like. They ask me if I'm glad that I waited even though \"all my friends were doing it.\" They want to know if I regret it. They want me to tell them if it was as great as I'd hoped it would be. I'm honest with my friends and I'll be honest now. I am glad I wait\u00ad ed until I found someone special and I don't regret it. It was great eventually, after I got over that awkward and frightening \"I can't believe I'm naked'\" phase. But it did not change my life the way I was led to believe. Having sex didn't make me wiser or more mature, like some character out of \"Bold and Breathless Nights.\" It didn't make me feel more loved nor did it inspire any profound revela\u00ad tions. I was still the same, clueless person ... no closer to solving any of life's great mysteries. After years and years of reading about sex - and consequently assuming it was the end-all-be-all of experiences - I was disappointed that my life had\u00ad n't changed much. In retrospect , I realize that the experience did have an impact on me, but in small, subtle ways. Only in bits and pieces did I begin to sep\u00ad arate out the experience from the hype of my cultural education. I used to feel sorry for myself because I hadn't had sex. Now it's not the virgins that I pity, but peo\u00ad ple who feel the need to be validat- ed by their sexual acts. . A friend of mine and I once argued about the pros and cons of waiting until marriage to have sex. I agreed with her that sex could be more meaningful in the context of a stable, loving relationship . Yet when she told me that her virginity was the \"most precious gift\" she could give her husband, I looked back to my Baja fantasies and shook my head. Sometime s sex is just sex. I think love is the \"most precious gi ft.\" I haven't tigured out the \"fairy\u00ad tale ending\" just yet, but I'll keep you posted.

Most recently. the Tritons were upset in both games of a doubleheader beller luck earlier in the week as they took both games in their doubleheader against Colorado College, 5-2 and 8-5. The first game of two against Claremont College was a defensive duel as both learns only allowed three hits. The only run was scored by Claremont in the third inning. as two of the team's three hits came at an ideal time. UCSD's Leea Harlan was on the mound. and gave up only one run on three hits while pitching a complete game. Harlan managed to strike out four bailers in the game. Kristina Anderson. Michelle Wilson and Cynthia Sam each had one hit for the Tritons, but no offense could be mustered to score any runs. The second game was also evenly matched. Harlan pitched a complete game, going all seven innings and giving up one unearned run and scallel ing five hits. However. the Tritons could not get any offense going as the team's five hits were few and far between. Wilson and Christina Scaring led the only offense that the Tritons put forth. going 2 for 3 from the plate. Harlan was the only other team member to get a hit as the Tritons were blanked 1-0. The Tritons had pre\u00ad viously improved their record to 20-9 after winning both games of a doubleheader against Colorado College. Samantha Hayes pitched a beautiful game, giving up two runs (one unearned) and two hits. Hayes also struck out five batters in seven innings. Hayes was hard at work off the mound as well. She drove in Wil on for the first run of the game in the second inning. The Triton bats were not done after Hayes second inning RBI, and two more runs were tacked on in the later innings. making the final score 5-2. The second game of the double\u00ad header went well for the Tritons, as Allison Jacobs struck out three bat\u00ad ters and pitched a complete game for the win. The Tritons shot past Colorado College, 8-5. Harlan led the way with three RBis and also scored twice, going 2- 4 in the game. Searing also went 2-4. scoring once and getting an RBI. The Tritons arc currently preparing to end regular season play and are getting geared up for the playoffs. The UCSD Guardian POLO: Strong defense fuels latest win Continued from page 20 inevitable that the Tritons would increase their lead in the second hair. The Tritons did increase their lead in the second half, but defense was the real story. While the Tritons Inanaged to get one goal on the board in the third quar\u00ad ter, it was their defense that really took charge. \"We played good defense,\" assistant coach Larry Sanders said. Maryam Hadiashar had anoth\u00ad er \"good\" day in front of the cage for the Tritons, and racked up a number of saves. After two early fi rst quarter goals, Hadiashar was practically unbeatable. Wallis, Burch, Irwin, Smith and Erin Welsh also stepped things up defen~ively for the Tritons. The crew created a bunch of turnovers and kept the Lions VBALL: Tritons bid farewell to seniors Continued from page 20 lost before they have started. \"It's difficult for sure to have a season like thi ,\" Stevenson said. \"Sometimes you have to get grati\u00ad fication out of di fferent goals\" One goal of the Tritons surely aim for is to play their bcst and many of them have come close. Jeffcoat has had a great all-around from shooting often times, making Hadiashar's job a lot easier. While the Tritons had a com\u00ad mendable game against LMU, both Harper and Sanders said there is still some work to be done. \"Our counter-allack has really improved. but we're still strug\u00ad gling a bit with the six on fives,\" Harper said. Sanders agreed. \"We didn't capitalize on a lot of man-up opportunities,\" Sanders said. \"It was a little frustrating for us.\" Frustrations aside, the Tritons have been on the path of improve\u00ad ment all season long, and with practically all of its roster healthy and back in action on Saturday, Monday, April 19, 1999 the team seems to be peaking just in time for the postseason. Held this Friday and Saturday at Canyon View pool. the Western Qualification-Southern Section Tournament will be the deciding factor between whether or not the Tritons will advance to the USA Collegiate Nationals held at UC Davis on May 7-9. The competition at the western qualifiers -UC Santa Barbara, UCLA, USC, San Diego State, Long Beach State and LMU - will be nothing new for the Tritons. The Tritons have faced all of the e schools previously this season, and all the games have been close. This time around pr<tmises to be no different -the games will be hard-rought. alEDOlffilill APRIL. 1 nH VS. LMU .1 2 o 2 3 1 0 4 1 of 1 2 To'''' 4 7 Emma Kudritzkl: 3 lOals. ~. , H. Smith, J. Irwin, M. Wallis, D. Burch: 1 goal each statistical season while Seekington has been the glue for a squad that constantly needs to rebound from losses. Hite and transfer student Chen have had plenty of game experience that will surely help them next season. This season has laid the ground\u00ad work for future successes\u00b7 and Stevenson has big plans. \"While the athletic department is Division Hi,\" he said, \"the only way to be a [men's volleyball] head coach ill UCSD is to treat it like it's Division I. [ can't give money and [ can't do some other things, but [ can train my players and try to outfit my players the way other elite programs do.\" So it seems that despite all the losses, UCSD really is better off by being in the MPSF and using the \"anytime, anywhere\" philosophy. \"The best way to bui Id the pro\u00ad gram up is with entirely Division I opponents,\" Stevenson said. \"The biggest goal this year was to steadily improve and I think our team did that. \" Next year should be even beller.

Chapped by Panthers ROUGH: UCSD falls to Chapman once again despite Gherini's good outing By Brian Welles Staff Writer Rap artist DMX has his version of \"Hell is Hot\" and after playing Chapman University three time this season, the UCSD baseball team has its version of hell too - scorching hot I And we don't mean hot in the sense of having put together a win\u00ad ning streak over Chapman University from Orange County, but rather the unpleasant taste of hot, acrid \"orange\" juice in the form of a third defeat this season at the hands of UCSD's Division III Independent rival. The weekend's weather wasn't the only indicator that it was hell outside. Chapman pulled another one out at Triton field in a 3-2 edging of UCSD in II innings on Saturday, handing the Tritons their fifth loss in six games. It is the 28-2 Panthers who have the juice now by beating UCSD, whose record now stands at 15-14. The Chapman loss marked UCSD's second defeat in as many days. On Friday, UCSD was also defeated by The Master's College, 15-4. Triton pitcher John Gherini can be the first to allest to the trials and tribulations involving the UCSD Tritons in pitching duels this sea\u00ad son. Gherini pitched a solid IO-plus innings, but opposing Chapman starter Jeff B litstein did too. Each pitcher also gave up only eight hits, but Blitstein gave up one less run, which was the dif\u00ad ference in the ball game. After the Panthers got a run off Gherini in the first on Saturday, the Tritons came up in the bOllom GRETZKY: The unbelieveable Canadian kid ContInued from ..... 20 Gretzky had 1,963 career assists.

Todd Sherwin was hit by a pitch and then Warrington advanced to third on a failed pickoff allempl. Kenny Fluharty singled home both men and UCSD grabbed a 2-1 lead. But in the top of the ninth, Chapman got to Gherini. Designated-hiller Pat Stevens led off the inning with a double to left center and from there the Panthers chalked up two walks, a bunt, and a sacrifice fly-out to center by second-baseman Mall Barcellona. which drove in the the sport you play so much they use it to get through life.

Saturday'S game might remind you of Gherini's showdown with Gregory Belson of Montclair SI. (N.J.) on March 10 in which Gherini went all nine, gave up only a run, but lost the game 1-0. Similarly, Gherini came out on the short end back on April 10 against Cal Lutheran after going eight innings and giving up a run only to suffer the loss. Despite the unfortunate results of his outings, he is tops among UCSD starters with a 2.92 ERA. The Tritons will pick up the pieces from Saturday's game and travel to Claremont for a game on Tuesday. . found you from across the ice, and the puck came in soft and flat, and all you did was put your stick on it.

I've kept journal and wrillen plays and even some droopy poems and let people read them, all of them, without fear of consequence. Trying in one shot to write about Wayne Gretzky is the single most intimidating task UCSD ever afforded me. Early Sunday morning I woke up in my friend's laundry pile. By the end of the day, the greatrst hockey career of all time was over. When asked why his goal numbers began to fall off in the late 80s, Gretzky replied that he had learned it wasn't port manlike to contin\u00ad ue scoring when his team was up by live or six goals. Some maintain that Gretzky's numbers are inflated, that he played in an era of free\u00ad wheeling hockey in which goals and assists came at a more fre\u00ad netic pace. Well, this is true, but the whole reason the game changed was because Gretzky was playing il. Babe Ruth best\u00ad ed the previous home run record by 37 blasts, and suddenly the home run became parl of base\u00ad ball. Wayne Gretzky got on the ice and suddenly seven goals a game was no longer a problem. Others will tell you that Gretzky wasn't a hard nosed defenseman, and couldn't play on both ends of the icc. Allow me to retorl. Does it really mat\u00ad ter how you play defense if the other team never has the puck? In the history of the HL, there have been only eight sea\u00ad sons when a player other than Gretzky recorded more than 150 points (players recieve points for both goals and assists). Gretzky went over 150 nine times. Oh yeah, Gretzky also went over 200 four different times 0 one else has ever had 200 points once. Chris Chelios, a defensemen who may be the best American \u00ad born hockey player of all time: once thought he had Gretz sealed off for sure but the Great One simply passed him the puck and then proceeded to take it away from him and score. Yet he was more than a scorer -Gretz was a giver. He has more assist than any one el e has total points. Gordie Howe, is second in the HL with 1,809 career points.

When a smaller program is looking to gain recognition and build a reputation, it asks to play bigger college pow\u00ad erhouse programs \"anytime and anywhere\" they choose. Although the result is usually a big loss for the smaller school. the exposure and the chance to play against elite competition outweigh the blemish on their overall record. Eventually, the smaller chool may even win one or two of these seemingly unwinnablc contests. Enough of the e small succes es can lead to beller recruiting and larger alumni uppon. By slowly building the program up this way, the small school may eventually find itself a collegiate powerhouse. At UCSD, there is at least one team that seems to abide by this philosophy : the Triton rnen's vol\u00ad leyball team. Never one to back down from a challenge, this intre\u00ad pid Divi ion III squadron is a mem\u00ad ber of the Mountain Paci fic Sports Federation (MPSF), a collection bf the best Division I teams in the nation. Needless to say, its partici\u00ad pation in the MPSF leads to many lopsided victories for its oppo\u00ad nents. Yet every loss is seemingly good for the program because the players play the very best in col\u00ad lege volleyball and gain exposure for UCSD. Still, don't try telling that to this year's volleyball play\u00ad ers. In non-federation play, the Tritons have a healthy 4-1 record and handily beat University of La Veme, their D-lII rival, near the end of the season. Still. the Tritons were somehow passed over in favor of the Leopards for the Division III Invitational Championships because La Verne Lisa Huff/Guardian Rec:o ... ltlon: Seniors on the UCSD men's volleyball team are applauded by Triton fans in their last game ever in RIMAC Arena.

Three of their last six games have been decided in overtime, and one of them - last Wednesday's battle with San Diego State - tumed into a marathon of a match, lasting through four overtime peri\u00ad ods. But on Saturday, the Tritons were not going to play that way. Head Coach Denny Harper' squad wanted to beat Loyola Marymount University with authority -a feat it was unable to accomplish in the team's last duel in which the Tritons needed an overtime period to beat the Lions. Fonunately everything clicked for UeSD on Saturday, and the Tritons took home a decisive 7-4 win against a strong LMU squad, improving their record to 10-12 on the season. Freshman Emma Kudritzki, who put three shots past the Lions' keeper, was the Tritons' leading goal scorer. Hilary Smith, Jenny Irwin, Megan Wallis and Dara Burch added one goal apiece to UeSD's total. Though the Tritons were not lacking in offense by the end of the game, Harper said it took a quarter for the Triton attack to get its offen-sive juices nowing. \"We got off to a sluggish start,\" Harper said, commenting on the Tritons' 0-2 fir t-quarter deficit, \"but we rebounded and got it going.\" Despite giving up two early goals to No. 15 LMU, the Tritons bounced back in the second quarter and put 4 goals in the back of the cage. These goals, matched by only I goal from LMU, gave the Tritons a 4-3 lead at the half. After a halftime show from two members of UCSD's men's water polo team, who fired-up the rau\u00ad cous Triton crowd with a stellar cheer and a tandem \"nying squir\u00ad rel\" and \"cannon baJl\" act from the Canyon View high-dive, it was See POLO, Page 18 ~ --'----- ... ----'-.:;;; =- '-1 _. ~.-\"- : "}
