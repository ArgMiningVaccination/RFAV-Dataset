The supplement market is flooded with low-quality, ineffective vitamin and mineral supplements, and diet fads that do not support overall health. It can be hard to distinguish which specific supplements you may need. We are here to help make that easy for you! Along with nutrition consultations we also formulate a supplement regimen for you. It is personalized to support your nutritional needs. You can also get started by following this [Nutri-Physical: A Personalized Nutrition](https://www.nutrametrix.com/nutri-physical/?ri-physical/) to take an online quiz to get a general personalized recommendation. The top 3 things to look at when selecting a supplement are dosage, ingredients and bioavailability. Dosages vary depending on an individual's health condition. You may not always take the supplements directly on the bottle, but we're here to help you figure that out. Ingredients are very important as we want to make sure there aren't any extra fillers and that it is sourced well. Bioavailability is important because not all supplements are made to optimize absorption. You don't want to be taking supplements that you won't be able to absorb. We are more than happy to help you customize a program that fits your unique needs! Contact us "}
