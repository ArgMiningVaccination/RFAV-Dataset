MABT, a manualized 8 week protocol, teaches interoceptive awareness skills to promote self-care and emotion regulation. A small study was designed to assess MABT recruitment and retention feasibility, and intervention acceptability, among this population. Individuals were recruited from two office-based programs providing buprenorphine treatment within a large urban community medical center. Participants were randomized to receive either treatment as usual (TAU), or TAU plus MABT. Assessments administered at baseline and 10-week follow-up included validated self-report health questionnaires and a process measure, the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness, to examine interoceptive awareness skills. An additional survey and exit interview for those in the MABT study arm were administered to assess intervention satisfaction. Results showed the ability to recruit and enroll 10 participants within two-weeks, and no loss to follow-up. The MABT study group showed an increase in interoceptive awareness skills from baseline to follow-up, whereas the control group did not. Responses to the satisfaction questionnaire and exit interview were positive, indicating skills learned, satisfaction with the interventionists, and overall perceived benefit of the intervention. In summary, study results demonstrated recruitment and retention feasibility, and high intervention acceptability. This pilot study suggests preliminary feasibility of successfully implementing a larger study of MABT as an adjunct to office-based medication treatment \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
