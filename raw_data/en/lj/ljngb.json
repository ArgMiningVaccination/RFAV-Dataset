The bacteria can infect the lining around the brain and spinal cord, or cause blood poisoning. Who's at risk You can get meningococcal at any age but people most at risk include:: - infants, small children, adolescents, and young adults - Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 2 months to 19 years - people exposed to cigarette smoke - people going to countries with a high rate of the disease - people with a weak immune system - people who haven't been vaccinated. Signs and symptoms Symptoms in babies - Fever - Cold hands and feet - Refusal to feed - Vomiting - High pitched crying or whimpering - Dislike of being handled, fretful - A rash of red-purple spots or bruises that don't fade under pressure - Blank and staring expression - Bulging fontanelle, the soft spot of a newborn's skull - Difficult to wake and lethargic - Pale and blotchy complexion Symptoms in older children and adults - Vomiting - Fever - Headaches - Stiff neck - Dislike of bright lights - Drowsiness - Joint pain - A rash of red-purple spots or bruises that don't fade under pressure. Don't wait to see a rash before getting medical help. Sometimes people don't get a rash or it appears later. How it spreads It's not easy to catch meningococcal and the bacteria doesn't survive well outside your body. If you have the bacteria, you can pass it to someone else through secretions in the back of your nose and throat. You would need to have close and prolonged contact with that person. You may not know you're carrying the bacteria and feel completely well. An example of close and prolonged contact is living in the same house or intimate (deep) kissing. The bacteria isn't easily spread by sharing drinks, food or smokes. If you do smoke, you have a higher chance of carrying the bacteria and spreading it to others. It's important not to smoke around young children and anyone else who has a higher risk of getting the disease. If someone around you gets infected If you're living with someone or you're a close contact of someone who gets infected, the public health authorities will let you know. They may prescribe a short course of antibiotics or tell you to get vaccinated. These don't always stop you from getting infected, so you need to watch for any symptoms for 2 weeks after being with the infected person. You can still go to work, school and childcare whether or not you've had antibiotics or been vaccinated. Prevention and vaccination You can get vaccinated against meningococcal strains A, B, C, W and Y. These don't protect against all strains of the disease, so you still need to watch out for the symptoms and signs. Meningococcal ACWY vaccine is free under the National Immunisation Program for: - children aged 12 months - people aged 15 to 19 years - people with medical conditions that increase their risk of invasive meningococcal disease.
