Ritual: Place 2 Tbs of tea (3 for long hair) into a teapot with a strainer, a bowl, or a clean French press with no scent of coffee. Pour 2 cups boiling water (3 for long hair) over tea leaves, and drape a towel over your head to capture steam. Breathe deeply as you allow the nourishing botanicals to work their magic in harmony with the 15-minute meditations found at: [wildlandorganics.com/pages/cocoon](https://www.wildlandorganics.com/pages/cocoon) [wildlandorganics.com/pages/newhorizons](https://www.wildlandorganics.com/pages/newhorizons) After your meditative facial steam, allow tea to steep another 15 min or until warm (not hot). Place a large bowl in the sink, strain tea, and pour gently over clean hair allowing the large bowl to catch the excess. Pour excess tea back into the pouring vessel and repeat 3x. Tea can be left in hair as a leave-in conditioner, or rinsed out for a lighter treatment. Excess tea can be refrigerated in a clean, airtight container and reused as a hair treatment or leave-in conditioning spray within 8-10 days. Even More Uses! We invite you to make the ritual your own with these alternative treatments: - Rejuvenating Facial Mist: After the facial steam, strain the tea leaves and pour tea into a misting bottle like this one. Keep this delightful herbal brew refrigerated, and use for up to 8-10 days. Also works beautifully as a curl-reviving spray! - Meditative Bath Soak: Steep half the contents of the full-size jar in a standard size (34 oz) clean French press filled with hot water for 20 minutes. A simple stove-top method works too! Strain the tea and pour into warm bathwater. Press play on your meditation as you step into your bath soak, and imagine the emotional blocks you may have built up throughout your day melting away with the warmth of the floral water. Breathe deep, relax, and allow the combination of guided meditation and organic herbs to nourish you - mind, body, and soul.
