There are 8 communes with 55 villages in total, and a population of around 60,000 persons. Chaom Ksant District was selected for the Link NCA Study due to minimal NGO activity at the time of scoping missions , and poor nutr itional indicators. Preah Vihear/Stung Treng Province was reported to have 47.1% in the lowest wealth quintile and 27.3% in the second wealth quintile in the most recent DHS (Demographic Health Survey) . Prevalence of stunting was highest at 44.3% and Moder ate Acut e Malnutrition (MAM) was among the highest for all the provinces at 13.8%. It also showed the second highest infant mortality rate at 70 per 1,000 live births. Objectives The main objective of the Link NCA was to provide a greater level of underst anding regarding the possible causes of child undernutrition, in particular wasting and stunting of children aged 0 -59 months, in Choam Ksant District, Preah Vihear Province, Cambodia. The objectives of the study were: To estimate the prevalence of known r isk factors for under -nutrition among the population and key \"nutrition vulnerable groups\"; To identify main causes of wasting and stunting in order to inform the technical strategy and programs for the prevention of the same at local level; To determine which causal pathways of malnourishment are likely to explain most undernutrition cases in Choam Ksant district; To develop an \"emic\" definition and understanding of good nutrition, malnutrition and believed causes of under -nutrition within the target pop ulation ; To understand the local seasonal and historical pathways to wasting and stunt ing; To support technical advocacy on causes of undernutrition so as to support technical strategy; and, To improve knowledge of the causes of undernutrition for provinc ial departments and NGOs working in the area to improve programme impact and coordination between active parties. Methods The Link NCA began in December 2015 with a review of current literature and secondary data to draft hypothesized causal risk factors f or undernutrition in Choam Ksant District. An initial Stakeholder Technical Workshop with representatives from various sectors and organisations was held in January 2016 to validate the hypothesised causal risk factors for field testing. The data collectio n began in February and ran for 5 weeks in total. The Link NCA employs a mixed -methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and Key Informant Interviews (KIIs) were conducted in 4 communitie s, and a Risk Factor Survey was conducted in 30 clusters across 25 villages, with anthropometric measurements taken of children aged 6 -59 months, v and females aged 15 -49 years. Following data analysis, results were presented for each hypothesised causal ris k factors at a final Stakeholder Technical Workshop in March. Through multi -sector working groups, results were validated and a final rating was assigned to each of t he causal risk factors based on: secondary data, Risk Factor Survey data, the evidence bas e for the strength of association between the risk factor and undernutrition, seasonal patterns /historical trends , qualitative data, and risk factor ranking by the communities (full explanation of Criteria can be found in the Report). Findings Major risk f actors identified were open defecation and unhygienic environments, and high prevalence of illness in children under 5 -years. There were high rates of open defecation ( 83.0% ) and unsafe disposal of child faeces (49.6% ). Additionally, animal faeces in the h ousehold and community waste were adding to unhygienic environments. There is a strong association with these behaviours and child illness such as diarrhoea (34.1%), environmental enteropathy, and parasitic worms (57.7% of children under 5 -years had not re ceived deworming medication in the last 12 -months), all shown to be associated with child undernutrition. Additionally, there was reported high prevalence of fever (53.3%) and ARI (68.3%). Important contributing risk factors to high disease prevalence were poor hygiene practices , drinking of untreated water, and poor exposure to health advice in many communities. This included barriers to healthcare and limited community health activities, meaning illness was prolonged and preventive behaviours were low. Poor care practices was identified as an important contributing risk factor , with impact on : poor hygiene practices, poor drinking water treatment, feeding practices, and prevention and treatment of illness. Poor care practices were perceived by communitie s to be mainly due to time constraints with high maternal workload, other contributors identified were poor maternal wellness and gender issues, with risk of maternal depression very high at 55.3%, poor resources in the field, use of secondary carers with less ability for proper care practices, and poor knowledge attainment. Maternal occupation was often seasonal from June to March, with many of these practices showing seasonal trend s too. Low incomes and limited livelihoods were identified as an important contributing risk factor. Low incomes were perceived by communities to be the root cause of poor diets, poor growth, poor health, and time constraints among other things. Low incomes and limited livelihoods impacted on other important risk factors: agricu ltural dependence and poor crop diversity, poor resilience, household food insecurity, maternal employment and migration, and maternal wellness. There is the perception that incomes are decreasing due to extreme weather events, lack of diversity of agricul tural products and deforestation. With reducing incomes, the practice of taking loans is rapidly increasing. These were being repaid with income generated from sale of agricultural crops, which were becoming unreliable, causing a deteriorating cycle of coping strategies. Household food security was an important risk factor affected by poor resilience, low incomes and limited livelihoods, poor market access and poor infrastructure, and agricultural dependence for incomes and rice stocks. Household food secu rity indicators showed an adequate situation at the time of the study , however the Link NCA was not conducted at the peak of the lean season. Rice shortages occurred pre -harvest in Augus t to October, whereas wild food and fish shortages were in the dry sea son from November -April. Children's diets lacked in diversity, animal source foods, and frequency with minimum diet diversity reached in 44.5% of children under 2 -years, and minimum meal frequency in 45.1%. Practice of giving packaged snack foods was alar mingly high with most mothers giving these daily, a new practice that had increased over the last few years despite mothers knowing that these foods are not good for their children. Household food security, low incomes, poor exposure to health advice, and poor care vi practices impacted on the quality of children's diets, another important contributor to child undernutrition. Risk factors identified as Minor contributors to undernutrition were mosquito -borne disease, delivery without skilled professional, earl y child bearing, inadequate breastfeeding practices, poor nutritional status of WCBA (Women of Child Bearing Age) , and poor knowledge attainment. Poor awareness of malnutrition was classified as untested due to the complicated nature of indicators for this risk factor. It is recommended that a specific study is conducted to focus on this factor. Conclusions A complex situation exists, with minimal resources to enable behaviour change despite good knowledge in some communities. With minimal commune funding a nd scattered coverage of local NGOs, there is a need for collaboration and coordination of activities for maximum coverage and impact. Two risk factors were highlighted as 'Major': open defecation and unhygienic environments, and the closely related child illnesses (diarrhoea, environmental enteropathy and worms, as well as fever and ARI). Given these results, the recommendation is a Nutrition programme with a strong WASH - component or collaboration with a WASH partner. The Nutrition component should focus o n IYCF and maternal diets, with promotion of age -appropriate feeding for children, including the amount of food given, and increased food intake during pregnan cy. The WASH component should focus on reducing open defecation, safe disposal of faeces, cleanin g up environments, and improved handwashing practices at critical times. Recently a Nutrition -WASH sub -working Group has been established at National level with key actors in both sectors. This shows there is already National momentum for the integration o f Nutrition and WASH programming. As a number of risk factors were identified as 'Important' under food security and livelihoods (FSL) , it is also recommended that the programme contain a FSL component to improve the capacity and ability of households to generate sustainable and reliable incomes to improve household wealth, which impacts on most of these risk factors with income the main barrier to providing good diets to children. This will also hopefully reduce the large number of households regularly taking loans or selling assets making them financially vulnerable. Recommendations Prior to implementation of the programme, it is recommended to spend time to ensure community buy-in. Additionally, an overarching recommendation is the consideration of all caregivers (mothers, fathers, grandmothers, possibly adolescent siblings) for activities to ensure secondary caregivers are improving practices and fathers are support wives in good practices. In some communities, knowledge is not the issue but there are b arriers to behaviour change, therefore SBCC (Social Behaviour Change and Communication) approaches should be carefully designed to provide optimal behaviour change, and progress of positive behaviours should be monitored with strategies adapted and improve d with operational learning and observations. Additionally, education levels are poor in many households and as such interactive and demonstrative SBCC tools should be used to deliver educational messages. Many risk factors showed seasonality - with worse practices during the farming season when adults tended to be away from the household. Many behaviours that are often promoted such as hand washing with soap, treatment of water, using latrines are not possible in the field or forest setting. This should b e considered, with possible solutions for how to enable these practices at all times of the vii year. On this note, timing and location of activities should be carefully thought about to ensure activities have maximum participation. It is likely that in the fa rming season, the best location for any group meetings or educational sessions would be in the fields. Migration season should also be factored in to timings. Specific recommendations for activities are detailed in the main report. viii Contents Acknowledgments 1.2. Main study objective 1.3. Specific study objectives ................................ 2.

Introduction 1.1. Action Against Hunger Cambodia Action Against Hunger Internat ional (ACF) was previously active in Cambodia from 1988 to 2007, leaving as the situation had improved with Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) rates at 8.5% according to the Cambodian DHS in 2005. However, by 2010 the situation had begun to deteriorate with G AM at 11.0%. For Preah Vihear Province, where ACF previously had their programmes, stunting was at 56% in 2010. Given this situation Action Against Hunger have decided to return to Cambodia to implement a nutrition -resilience multi -sectorial programme, wor king closely with provincial departments and local NGOs. 1.2. Choam Ksant District , Cambodia Choam Ksant district is North -East Province of Preah Vihear (PVH) , which borders Thailand and Laos. There are 8 communes with 55 villages in total , and a population of around 60,000 persons . Choam Ksant District has a history of conflict due to its location on the border of Thailand. Most recently there was a conflict between Cambodia and Thailand over the ownership of the Preah Vihear Temple. Given this, there is a history of migration and relocation in these areas. Recently the government has encouraged people and companies to settle in this district to try to repopulate the area. Among the 55 villages are: long -term villages founded prior to the Khmer R ouge and following the Khmer Rouge, military settlements, and new villages of military families, resettled households and migrants from other Provinces, and new villages are appearing frequently. Chaom Ksant District was selected for the Link NCA Study due to minimal NGO activity at the time of scoping missions and poor nutritional indicators. 2 Section I: Methodological considerations 1. Why conduct a Link NCA? 1.1. Context information There is little to no data available at dist rict level, however Preah Vih ear/Stung Treng Province was reported to have 47.1% in the lowest wealth quintile, and 27.3% in the second wealth quintile in the most recent DHS. There were the lowest numbers for having some secondary education for both males and females, at 16.0% and 15 .4% respectively. There was the highest prevalence of stunting at 44.3%, Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) was also in the highest for all the provinces at 13.8%. Figure 1 shows the trends over the last 15 years for nutritional status of the population . It can be seen that there has been progress in reducing Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM), but that stunting has increased between 2005 and 2010 , and underweight has increased since 2010. For women 15 -49 years, Preah Vihear/Stung Treng was among the highest fo r short stature at 8.0% and moderately to severely thin at 5.2%.1 Figure 1 Trends in nutritional status 2000 - 2015 for Preah Vihea r/Stung Treng f rom the Cambodian DHS In Cambodia , rural areas show worse indic ators for sanitation and water with 60.1% having access to improved drinking water, and 39.7% having improved sanitation which is not shared . There is widespread open defecation. Preah Vihear/Stung Treng showed one of the highest practices of unsafe disposal of child's faeces at 50.0%. Incidence of diarrhoea in children under 5 -years was the 2nd highest at 19.3%. Despite high numbers of women attending ANC, for pregnancies in the last 5 years in Preah Vihear/Stung Treng there were some of the lowest numbers for women taking in testinal parasite drugs at 59.6%, receiving tetanus vaccination at 45.1%, and one of the highest numbers for home births at 48.8%. The suggestion here is that there may be issues with Health Centre services or resources in the province. There was also one of the lowest for children 12 -23 months having had all basic vaccinations at 55.6%, and the second highest infant mortality rate at 70 per 1,000 live births. 1 National Institute of Statistics, Directorate General for Health, and ICF International, Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2014, 2015 3 Progress has been made in many areas, however with its remote location and basic infrastructure Choam Ksant has a number of worrying indicators across all sectors. This Link NCA aims to identify the main risk factors for undernutrition in the District. 1.2. Main study objective The main objective wa s to identify the most important causes of child undernutr ition, in particular wasting and stunting of children aged 0 -59 months, in Choam Ksant District, Preah Vihear Province, Cambodia. 1.3. Specific study objectives The objectives of the study were : To estimate the prevalence of known risk factors for under -nutriti on among the population and key \"nutrition vulnerable groups\"; To identify main causes of wasting and stunting in order to inform the technical strategy and programs for the prevention of the same at local level; To determine which causal pathways of maln ourishment are likely to explain most undernutrition cases in Choam Ksant district; To develop an \"emic\" definition and understanding of good nutrition, malnutrition and believed causes of under -nutrition within the target population ; To understand the lo cal seasonal and historical pathways to wasting and stunt ing; To support technical advocacy on causes of undernutrition so as to support technical strategy; and, To improve knowledge of the causes of undernutrition for provincial departments and NGOs work ing in the area to improve programme impact and coordination between active parties. 2. The Link NCA Methodology 2.1. Overview of the Link NCA Approach The Link NCA was developed by ACF i n order to strengthen the analytical foundation on which its programs are built. The Link N CA provides a structured and operationally feasible method for conducti ng a nutrition causal analysis in a specified local context. All Link NCAs aim to answer the following 6 questions : What is the prevalence and severity of wasting and/or stunting in the study population? What is the prevalence of known risk factors for under -nutrition among the population and key \"nutrition vulnerable groups\"? What are the causal pathways of under -nutrition by which certain children in this population have become stunted and/or wasted? 4 How have the stunting and/or wasting in this population and its causes changed a) over time due to historical trends, b) seasonally due to cyclical trends, c) due to recent shocks? Which causal pathways are likely to explain most cases of under -nutrition? Which sets of risk factors and pathways are likely to be the most modifiable by stakeholders within a given context and within a given period? Based on the causal analysis results, what recommendations can be made for impro ving nutrition security programming? How can the analysis be linked to a programmatic response? To answer the 6 questions, the Link NCA employs a mixed -methods approach , combining both qualitative and quantitative (from qualitative survey secondary data an d/or from a SMART nutrition survey and Risk Factor Survey conducted during the Link NCA) research methods, and draws conclusions from a synthesis of results. 2.2. Study Design A timeline of the Link NCA study can be found in Annex A. 2.2.1. Initial Stakeholder Technic al Workshop An Initial Stakeholder Technical Workshop was held on the 14th January 2015 to validate the proposed hypotheses for the causes of undernutrition to be field tested during the Link NCA. Stakeholders were invited from multiple sectors and multipl e types of organisation and asked to work in mixed groups to facilitate multi -sectoral discussions and ideas. 2.2.2. Field data collection The qualitative component was conducted in four villages in Choam Ksant with selected groups of each community. Th is quali tative enquiry ran from 25th February to 5th March 2016 and from the 14th - 25th March 2016 , with 5 days spent in each village. The Risk Factor and Nutritiona l Status Survey was conducted at households in 25 villages from the 15th February to the 4th March 2016. 2.2.3. Final Stakeholder Technical Workshop Findings from the data collection were used for the Link NCA Analyst to objectively rate causal hypotheses using pre -set criteria. During the qualitative enquiries, on the last day in each village the communities were asked to give a rating to the relevant causal hypotheses for their village and an average was calculated for each hypotheses . Findings and the r esults of the Link NCA Analyst and Community ratings were presented to the Stakeholders on 29th March 2016 at a Final Workshop with the objective to reach a consensus on the most important risk factors for undernutrition in the Link NCA study area. 3. Sampling Procedures 3.1. Selected method and s ample size calculations 5 3.1.1. Sampling methodology The selected sampling me thod was random cluster sampling. 3.1.2. Indicators to be measured In Table 1 are the core indicators for the Link NCA, these are highly recommended for most contexts. This list will be reviewed at the time of survey preparation: indicators not relevant to the co ntext will be removed and optional indicators will be added. For the purpose of calculating the sample size, a selection of the core indicators is sufficient.

Sample size ca lculation The Household (HH) average size has been considered as 4.5 members/HH, taken from the rural category of the Cambodian Demographic Health Survey (CDHS) 2014. The number of children for each age group per HH has been deduced from the rural children under 5 years population of 11.5% and the number of members/HH2. 2 National Institute o f Statistics, Directorate General for Health, and ICF International, Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2014, 2015 6 Sample size was calculated for a selection of relevant indicators (Table 2). Prevalence of wasting, stunting, diarrhoea , skilled assistance at birth, minimum diet diversity and early childbe aring were taken from the CDHS 2014 for Preah Vihear/ Stung Treng strata .3 Exclusive breastfeeding, HDDS, caregivers completing primary education, PNC attendance, caregivers washing hands after defecating, and access to improved sanitation facilities were taken from the IMCF Baseline survey in Oddar Meanchey and Preah Vihear in , where the Preah Vihear strata only.4 Data on MAHFP and caregivers perceived workload were not available, and hence prevalence was taken as 0.5 to calculate the max imum size sample that would be needed. Indicators for which data were not available were given a prevalence of 50% to calculate maximum sample size required.

Number of households to be surveyed Based on the calculated household sample sizes in Table 2, those highlighted in red were too large for the human resources, time and budget of the Link NCA study. Given this, the sample size for stunting 3 National Institute of Statistics, Directorate General for Health, and ICF International, Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2014, 2 015 4A. Reinbott et al, IMCF Meanchey Povinces: Cross -sectional Nutrition Baseline Survey, 2013 7 at 691 was considered with an additi onal 5% for non -response rate (NRR) and data errors, the final calculated sample size was 691*1.05 = 728 households as a minimum to be surveyed. 3.1.5. Number of clusters to be selected With a proposed working day for survey staff of 9 hours, taking in to account 1 hour for lunch and an afternoon refreshment break and an average of 1 hour travel time each day, this would leave 7 hours to complete the survey questionnaires. The questionnaire is expected to take 1 hour, giving time for 7 surveys per day, not account ing for travel between households and completion of observations. Given that not all households will have a child under 5 -years, it is hoped that each team will complete 4 -5 questionnaires each day, leaving time for introductions, travel and to complete ob servations. Given that 8 teams have been foreseen in the budget, working for 15 days the options in Table 3 were proposed.

Some villages very remote 1 day in each village would not be sufficient. Of the selected villages , 4 were purposively selected for the qualitative survey to ensure good representation. 3.2. Sampling Procedure for the Risk Factor and Anthropometric Survey The method chosen for cluster selection was random cluster sampling given the size of the survey area and the distinct villages within the district. An exhaustive list of villages was created using official government data and meetings with the District Governor and Heads of Commune. Annex B lists all selected villages with population of households and people. Forty clusters were randomly assigned across 33 villages, and 5 reserve clusters (RC) were randomly assigned with ENA Software using Proportion Population Size (PPS) based on population in persons. 3.3. Sampling for the qualitative community enquires Four villages were purposive ly selected for the qualitative s urvey in order to be represent ative of the demographic scope of the area. The selected villages are detailed in Annex C. 8 4. Data Collection Methods 4.1. Quantitative Risk Factor and Anthropometric Survey 4.1.1. Data collection m ethod s Quantitative data was collected through the Risk Factor Survey and Anthropometric Survey at household level. Questionnaires were conducted at randomly selected households in each cluster and fully addressed only where there was a t least one child under 5 y ears residing. 4.1.1.1. Random selection of households A definition of a household was defined during the survey with the survey staff. The definition approved was: \"All the members who eat from the same pot and sleep under one roof at night.\" The selection of ho useholds was done following a two -stage cluster sampling or three -stage cluster sampling methodology. For both of the ways used, the first stage was the cluster selection using ENA Software according to the PPS selection method . For villages with a popula tion exceeding 250 households, a geographical segmentation was done inside the village and one segment was randomly selected (second -stage). If each segment contained approximately the same number of households, one was randomly selected. If each segment contained different numbers of households, then the segment was selected using PPS. The third stage of sampling was to select households. This was done using simple random sampling with random number tables. Household were selected from household maps with each house numbered. This configuration follows a three -stage cluster sampling. For clusters with a population less than 250 households, households were selected using simple random sampling (second -stage). This configuration follows a two -stage cluster sa mpling. 4.1.1.2. Collection of data Data was collected through household interviews. Questionnaires were translated into Khmer and uploaded on to ODK for use on the tablets. Questi onnaires can be found in Annex D . The Risk Factor Survey consisted of four sections: Household Level data (Food Security, Livelihoods and Income, Resilience, and WASH) Caregiver data (including Maternal, Education and Well -being, MUAC of females aged 15 -49 years) Child data (IYCF practices of children under 2 years, Health of children unde r 5 years, Children 6-59 months) WASH observations (Water source, Sanitation facilities) Each section was completed in selected household with a t least one child under 5 years. If there was no child under 5 years, the questionnaire was terminated. 9 4.1.2. Field T eam Composition, Recruitment and Training The survey team was composed of 4 team leaders and 16 surveyors, working as 8 pairs with one person in each pair assigned to conducting the questionnaire and anthropometric measurements, and the other assigned to o bservations and assisting with the anthropometric measurements. Each team leader was assigned two pairs, and assigned a Group from A -D. All survey staff were trained for five days with one and a half days assigned to training for anthropometric measurement s, two and a half days assigned to the RFS and one day assigned to a pilot field test. Candidates showing good understanding and leadership skills were selected as the team leaders. Assignment of roles in pairs was based on performance during training. Whe re possible pairs consisted of one male and one female surveyor s. Data was collected using tablets and as such all surveyors were trained on how to use Open Data Kit (ODK) Collect. Team leaders were trained in how to submit questionnaires at the end of eac h survey day. Technical support was provided by the Link NCA Analyst during the survey when needed. 4.1.3. Main challenges The main challenges of the Risk Factor Survey were poor roads between villages and very remote villages making the survey geographically ch allenging at times. Another challenge was poor signal in these villages, meaning survey data could not be submitted at the end of the day for some clusters. 4.2. Qualitative Community Enquiry 4.2.1. Research Instruments and m ethod s Data was collected through Key Info rmant Interviews (KII) and Focus Group Discussions (FGD) in four selected villages. Discussio n guides can be found in Annex E . Tools used included: proportional piling, working groups to create seasonal calendars, wealth ranking and rating exercises. 4.2.2. Data Collection KIIs were conducted with relevant key persons (V illage Health Support Group (VHSG)5, Traditional Birth Attendant (TBA) , Health centre staff) as well as with mothers of positive and negative deviant children , where it was possible to identify th em. FGDs were conducted with: Mothers of children under 5 years Fathers of children under 5 years Grandmothers caring for children under 5 years Village elders Key persons in the village (village chief, deputy village chief, VHSG, Teachers, Commune represe ntatives, etc) 5 VHSG Leaders are the primary point of contact for all health activities in the villages.Their Roles and Responsibilities we re defined by the Ministry of Health in order to support implementation of community -based health activities. 10 Topics discussed included: undernutrition, IYCF, health, WASH, care practices, gender roles and responsibilities, food security and liveliho ods. Each group attended for 2 hours, with 3 topics discussed in 20 -30 minute sessions. Grandmothers were included due to their major role in some commu nities as a secondary caregiver. They attended as a separate group, as well as fathers, as it is anticipated that perceptions and knowledge will differ between the different demographic groups. In village s with over 30% middle income or rich households, groups of mothers were separated in to wealth categories based on village chief or the VHSGs perception. 4.2.3. Stakeholder consultations Prior to the Link NCA, a number of KIIs were conducted with local stakehol ders to gather information on the context to aid questionnaire design as well as providing useful information for use in the analysis. Stakeholders met with during this time were: ADRA and MKRK (local NGO) Field Coordinators Provincial Department of Rural Development Caritas Cambodia Community Health and Nutrition Programme Manager Provincial Health Department Cambodian Red Cross WASH Officer ACF Wild Foods and Nutrition Intern CWS Field Coordinator Worldvision Nutrition Programme Manager Resilience Ex pert, FAO TPO Mental Health Officer Provincial Department of Agriculture Provincial Department of Women's Affairs 4.2.4. Field Team Composition, Recruitment and Training The Qualitative Team consisted of: Link NCA Analyst, field translator, community facilitato r, and a driver. The field translator was trained in the Link NCA methodology, qualitative research, and field translation as well as tests of the discussion guides and tools to be used. 4.2.5. Main challenges Participation of communities for the entire week was challenging at times. The decision was made to provide a small gift to groups who were being asked to attend on several days to encourage continued participation. Additionally, some groups were very poorly educated and did not wish to cooperate with the large number of questions, responses in these groups were harder to explore. 11 4.3. Team structure Figure 2 team structure for Link NCA in Preah Vihear Province, Cambodia 5. Data Management and Analysis 5.1. Initial workshop The proposed h ypothesised risk factors were presented to technical experts at the Initial Stakeholder Technical Workshop. Technical experts were invited to discuss, modify and add hypothesised risk factors. At the end of the workshop stakeholders were asked to rate each hypothesised risk factor. These were then averaged for each hypothesised risk factor. 5.2. Quantitative Data Management and Analysis Data was collected using ODK Collect and uploaded to a central, internet -based ACF ODK Aggregate. Data was exported and transfe rred to a database designed in Microsoft Excel 2013. For analysis Excel and Epi Info was used. Anthropometric data was transferred to ENA Software 2011 (July 9, 2015) for calculation of Z -scores and analysis . Exclusion of z -scores from Zero (reference mean ) flags: 5; HAZ WAZ -6 to 5 were applied . 5.3. Qualitative Data Management and Analysis Qualitative data was analysed using ongoing thematic coding at the end of each day. Summaries of emerging themes were also developed. Discussions were transferred to Excel with assigned themes, group type and village and later analysed using content analysis methods. 12 5.4. Rating Hypotheses Following data analysis, t he Link NCA analyst assigned ratings to the field -tested causal hypotheses based on the foll owing information : The p revalence of risk factors from secondary data (where available) The strength of the association between the risk factor and under -nutrition based on the current international evidence base Seasonality of the hypothesis and undernutr ition Community participatory ratings Ratings were assigned based on the Link NCA classifications: 5.5. Final Stakeholder Technical Workshop The findings and results of the rating exercise were presented and validated by technical experts at the Final Stakeho lder Technical Workshop. Technical experts were asked to inform their level of confidence in each rating by giving a 'confidence note'. These were then averaged for each hypothesised risk factor. 6. Ethical considerations taken during the survey 6.1. Research Et hics The main principles of human research are: respect for pe rsons, beneficence, and justice: 13 Respect means to respect that each person can make their own choice about whether to participate, and to respect the culture and communities where the research i s conducted. Beneficence means that researchers are responsible for the participants' physical, mental and social wellbeing . Ethical research should reduce the risks of the participant to a minimum. Additionally, any benefits to the community should be mad e clear. Justice means that participants must be recruited equitably, and the researcher should ensure special protected for vulnerable participants. 6.2. Ethical approval and informed consent Approval was sought at Provincial and District level from the Govern ors. A meeting was held with the District Governor , Heads of Commune and Heads of Health Centres in Choam Ksant to seek approval and inform them of the intention of the Link NCA. Verbal informed consent was obtained from all participants in the Link NCA. Children identified as having SAM were referred to the health centre. If the caregiver was unable to attend, arrangements were made to support them with this through UNICEF. 6.3. SAM and severely ill referral Protocol A referral form was obtained from a Health Centre in Choam Ksant and photocopied for the Team leaders. During the training,criteria for referral were highlighted and instructions also included in the electronic questionnaire. Team Leaders were asked to identify the closest Health Centre during introductions with the village chief in each village. 7. Limitations 7.1. Link NCA Methodology limitations The Link NCA present s a detailed, contextualised and local model of the causes of undernutrition and as such the results cannot be generalised to other areas of Cambodia. The Link NCA does not provide statistical c ausal associations . The Link NCA provides prioritisation of risk factors, with an inference of strength of causality. 7.2. Limitations encountered related to the study presented Sample size was calculated f or a number of key indicators. Due to time and resource constraints, the largest sample size could not be selected. For some indicators there is not adequate sample size for desired precisions. For 'handwashing practices' and 'child -caregiver interaction' , an oversight resulted in only part of the indicator being included in the questionnaire . These indicators are therefore weaker than a nticipated. Income was seasonal in the Link NCA context and as such it was decided not to measure monthly income. Instead , a subjective poverty score was calculated and used as a proxy for wealth groups. 14 The timing of the survey has two limitations: data collection was not at the peak of the lean season, and the data was collected during a period where migration for work is reportedly high . This introduced a sampling bias with anticipated poor inclusion of caregivers who had migrate d. Unfor eseen circumstances resulted in the field translator for the qualitative community enquiries not completing the 4 -weeks of qualitative dat a collection . This may introduce some discrepancies in interpretation of local terms and discussions from communities 1 and 2, to communities 3 and 4. 15 Section II: Link NCA Findings 1. Preliminary Stakeholder Technical Workshop 1.1. Causal hypotheses On the 14th January 2016, Action Against Hunger (ACF) International conducted a Stakeholder Technical Workshop. There were 26 participating experts in Nutrition, WASH, FSL, DRR, Gender, and Health. The objectives of the workshop were to reach consensus on the causal hypotheses to be field tested during the Link NCA. 1.1.1. Initial causal hypotheses A. High risk for mosquito -borne disease in children under 5 years Mosquito -borne diseases such as malaria and dengue result in fever, vomiting, and lack of appetite. Stress of the immune system uses up micronutrients and energy and can lead to deterioration in nutritional status. Pregnant women with malaria have an increased risk of delivering a LBW baby. PVH is an area with high risk for malaria and dengue, particularly in forested areas and in the rainy season. MSF are conducting malaria prevention projects in PVH, however they have not been implemented in Choam Ksant district. It appears that most households own mosquito nets, but information on who sleeps under the nets is not av ailable. B. High prevalence of illness in children under 5 years Acute infections have been shown to cause growth faltering in children under 5years, with continual bouts of infection during the first 2 -years of life reducing linear growth. Undernutrition als o increases the risk of becoming ill, causing a dangerous cyclical relationship. In the last 14 days, diarrhoea was reported in 19% of children in PVH and fever in 32.6%. Deworming medication had been received by 62.2% of CU5 in the last 6 -months (DHS 2014 ). High prevalence of illness in Choam Ksant appears to be in most part, due to poor hygiene and sanitation practices. C. Delivery without skilled professionals Those who deliver without a skilled professional are less likely to have attended PNC, and are les s likely to attend ANC where they would receive skilled advice on IYCF and care practices as well as maternal health and nutrition. These factors increase the risk of low birthweight, poor child growth and poor nutritional status. In the last 5 years 48.8% of live births were at home in PVH, with 54.4% delivered by a skilled provider (DHS 2014). There is a suggestion that grandmothers play a role in this decision making (KII) and additionally, health seeking behavior in general is constrained by cost, dista nce and time. D. Early child bearing Early childbearing is associated with a higher risk of low birthweight and subsequent increased risk of poor growth of the child. Additionally, early childbearing is associated with a lack of knowledge of proper maternal a nd IYCF practices. Of women aged 15 -19 years in PVH, 25.5% had begun childbearing (DHS 2014). Culturally in rural Cambodia women marry young, and there is an expectati on to have children soon after. 16 E. Workload of mothers and seasonal migration High workload of mothers increases the risk of poor breastfeeding and care practices due to the absence and lack of time of the mother, which increase the risk of child undernutrition. In PVH, women are traditionally responsible for household chores. In addition to thi s, 70.4% of women aged 15 -49 years are currently employed, of which 78.4% work in agriculture (DHS 2014). During the dry season, mothers from poor families often migrate for work, increasing due to depleting of local resources historically used to generate income in the dry season. In both cases, children are left at home, with elder family members or older siblings taking care for them. In the absence of mothers, adequate infant and young child feeding are not adopted resulting in increased risk for child illness, wasting and stunting. F. Maternal well -being There is some evidence to suggest that poor maternal well-being can affect the care practices of children, impacting on child growth. In PVH, 31.8% of women had experienced violence since the age of 15. Th e perpetrator of violence was most often the husband/partner or parent. There are reports that poverty causes mothers to cry and complain, and also increase the risk of domestic violence (KIIs). In PVH 47.1% of HHs are in the lowest wealth quintile, and 27 .3% in the second wealth quintile (DHS 2014). There is the suggestion that women experiencing domestic violence are more likely to migrate for work (KII), with effects on child feeding and care practices as children are often left at home G. Lack of exposure to skilled health advice Poor health seeking behavior leads to prolonged and more serious illness, as well as less access to skilled health advice, increasing the risk of good health and care practices. Given the link between disease and nutrition, this in creases the risk of poor child growth and nutritional status. In PVH it seems that mothers will use health centers, but it may not be the first choice with a historical preference to first seek local or traditional treatment methods. It seems this is due t o the cost and distance/time associated with attending a health center, as well as poor perceived quality of health care. Not seeking skilled medical attention and advice will results in poor frequent and prolonged illness in children with a subsequent inc reased risk of undernutrition. Due to poor education, many do not have prior knowledge of health and nutrition, and with poor health seeking behavio ur and poor coverage of nutrition and health activities in Choam Ksant district communities have poor exposu re to skilled advice on health and nutrition, increasing the risk of illness, and deterioration with poor nutritional status. H. Open defecation Lack of access to sanitation facilities is linked to increased risk of disease such as diarrhoea and intestinal pa rasites. Open defecation and unsafe disposal of feces introduces germs into the environment. Increased illness leads to increased risk of poor child growth in communities, not just at HH level. In PVH, only 10 -50% of HHs are reported to have access to latr ines in Choam Ksant district (KIIs). Although there are a number of projects to improve latrine access in PVH, this doesn't seemed to have reached Choam Ksant district. With a lack of knowledge about sanitation and hygiene with only 50% of child's stools a re disposed of safely (IMCF Baseline Survey, 201 3), and limited household income this is not likely a priority for families. I. Inconsistent access to clean water Contaminated water increases the risk of diarrhoea, intestinal parasites and other water -borne diseases, and subsequent deterioration of child nutritional status and growth. Access to clean water becomes limited in the dry season in PVH, with wells and hand pumps reported drying up due to overuse (KIIs). The main source of water in villages is hand p umps and wells in the dry season, and rain water in the wet season. It is reported that 87% of households have access to a clean water source 17 (IMCF baseline report, 201 3). However, it is reported that handpumps and wells become contaminated due to improper use (KIIs). Additionally, it seems there is a lack of safe household storage for water; likely due to lack of knowledge as well as lack of income. J. Poor hygiene practices Poor hygiene practices increases the risk of diarrhoea and intestinal parasites lead ing to increased risk of poor child growth and nutritional status. In PVH 13% of caregivers reporting washing their hands after defecating (IMCF baseline survey, 201 3). There are also reports of children appearing unclean (KII). Although there are health p romotion activities in the area, these are not widespread and it may be feasible to suggest that the lack of access to water impacts on households practicing these new behaviours. K. Inadequate breastfeeding practices WHO recommends a child is breastfed with in the first hour of life and exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life for optimal health, with strong evidence for its impact on reduction of illness. Early introduction of complementary foods has been associated with poor child growth. In PVH , early initiation of breastfeeding is at 77% (DHS 2014). However, it seems there is a cultural tradition to feed water and honey to newborns. It also seems many mothers stop exclusively breastfeeding at 4 -5 months with the likely implication of increased illness and early introduction of foods with subsequent increased risk of undernutrition and poor child growth. L. Inadequate care practices Poor hygiene and sanitation practices during preparation or feeding of complementary foods increases the risk of child illness such as diarrhoea, which increases the risk of wasting and stunting. In Cambodia, it is common for children to eat alone which can result in small children not eating properly. Additionally, less than one third of respondents washed their hands wi th soap before preparing food leading to unsafe preparation of children's foods (IMCF baseline 201 3). This is likely due to a lack of knowledge of good practices as well as cultural practices. M. Micronutrient deficient diets of children under 5 years Poor mi cronutrient status of children is due to poor dietary diversity and frequent illness. This results in increased risk of disease as well as poor child growth. Diarrhoea in particular causes zinc deficiencies, which have been linked to stunted growth in chil dren. In PVH only 27.8% of children aged 6 -23 months reach the recommended minimum dietary diversity (DHS 2014) and many are deficient in iron, zinc, vitamin A and thiamine. This is in part thought to be due to low crop diversity, with traditional rich - dom inant diets. In Cambodia there is also a genetic mutation which is thought to cause anaemia. It is reported that mothers have poor knowledge on how to prepare nutritious meals for children, even when the food is available (KII), resulting in poor nutrition al status and child growth as well as increased risk of childhood illness. N. Poor nutritional status of women of child bearing age The first 1000 days of life from -9months to 23months are a crucial stage for proper child development and growth. Poor nutrit ional status of women of child bearing age and pregnant women is associated with low birthweight and IUGR due to insufficient fetal nutrition. Low birthweight infants have an increased risk of child malnutrition, poor growth and poor health. In PVH, 16.4% of women aged 15 -49 were defined as thin by BMI<18.5 and 53.7% were anaemic (DHS 2014). In Cambodia there is a genetic mutation which is thought to cause anaemia, but there is also poor diversity of diets. PNC attendance is reportedly low and health seekin g behavior is not optimum, therefore knowledge levels of appropriate diets are likely to be low. 18 O. Household food insecurity Household food insecurity means less food at the household, this results in less calorific intake for household members and/or lower quality of diets through coping mechanisms. This increases the risk of poor child growth, and malnutrition in PLW during the food insecure period. In PVH, availability of rice determines HH food insecurity and hunger. Periodic food shortages occur close to the harvest seasons where there is less food available, and less income for those whose primary income is sale of crops to be able to access adequate food. Recently, unpredictable rains have been causing problems for farmers and as such it is anticipated that household food security may increase. P. Agricultural dependence Farming systems in PVH are dominated by rice rain fed system. Rice is the main staple food for the villagers, and when stocks from own production are over (lean season) farmers are seekin g jobs out of their farms to purchase food. This happens at a critical time when rice is growing in the fields and require particular attention. This reduction in workforce results in a reduction of the rice production, which then impacts on the rice stock for the next season. This rain fed system is particularly vulnerable to recent climate change and extreme weather events (droughts and floods). Farmers also borrow food or cash during the lean season, and reimburse from the sale of their rice production, after harvest when prices are low. This leads to a vicious cycle of rural poverty with 47.1% of HHs are in the lowest wealth quintile (DHS 2014). Rural poverty is associated with lower quantity and quality of diets, low education attainment, low healthcar e access, and poor hygiene and sanitation facilities, all observed in PVH. Q. Decreasing rural safety nets With many in PVH sitting just above the poverty line (87.3% in the lowest -middle wealth quintiles) and agricultural -dependence, many household are 'tran sient poor' with a lack of rural safety nets making them vulnerable to shocks. Historically, natural resources such as the forest have acted as a safety net to communities, providing a way to diversify incomes and diets, especially during the dry season. Recent deforestation and the effects of climate change on natural resources such as fisheries, is putting these rural safety nets in jeopardy, as well as an increase in migration. Inability to deal with shocks can lead to sudden changes in food access and d iet quality and quantity, increasing the risk of wasting and disease. Continual exposure to fluctuations (e.g. seasonal) are likely to result in poor childhood growth. R. Poor knowledge attainment Poor education is associated with risk of poor knowledge attai nment of health and nutrition practices, which results in high risk of maternal and child undernutrition and illness. Whereas knowledge in itself will not lead to change in behaviours if there is not access to resources, poor education attainment is often linked to socio -economic factors and less health seeking behavior. Education attainment is poor for females in PVH with only 7.1% having completed primary education. It is suggested that this is, in part, due to children being required to begin work at an early age due to rural household poverty. Around 30% of respondents named unclean hands as a cause of diarrhoea, and around 4% poor sanita tion (IMCF baseline survey, 2013 ). As well as poor education, a lack of coverage by health promotion activities is lik ely a contributing factor. Poor knowledge attainment of health, nutrition and hygiene increases the risk of poor nutritional status and health. S. Poor awareness of malnutrition Health workers have limited capacity in their understanding of the different type s of malnutrition, and awareness in communities is also reportedly low with little understanding of the symptoms and effects of malnutrition. Poor awareness of malnutrition will lead to poor prioritization of malnutrition prevention. 19 1.1.2. Validation o f initial causal hypotheses Following a review of secondary data and KIIs with local Stakeholders, 19 causal hypotheses were presented to the workshop participants for discussion. Hypotheses were validated, modified or added as follows: Validated A, B, C, D, G, I, J, K, L, N, O, R, S Modified E, F, H, M, P, Q, Added T, U The discussion around the modified and added hypotheses was as follows: Workload of mothers and seasonal migration : Modified to: Mother's employment and seasonal migration. Discussion as to whe ther this was one or two causes. It was suggested that workload could be combined with gender issues/balance (shared responsibilities with men, etc) and this has now been included in Hypothesis F . This hypothesis is about the mother's work which takes her away from her child i.e. outside employment. Many participants felt this was a dominant risk factor in terms of effect on IYCF and care practices. Maternal well -being : Modified to: Gender issues and maternal welln ess. The role of gender equity within mater nal well -being was discussed and thought to be a risk factor within itself. Highlighted that gender issues and women empowerment can impact on many of the risk factors outlined. In terms of WASH practices, women are not the main decision maker for large pu rchases such as latrines. The issue of household workload in terms of shared responsibilities will be included here. Women are often responsible for all domestic household tasks, as well as employment, leaving limited time for care of children. These facto rs are thought to affect maternal wellness, as well as poverty and stress, which is also shown to impact negatively on child care practices. Open defecation : Modified to: Open defecation and unhygienic environments . Not only human faeces, also livestock an d solid waste management which also spread bacteria and disease. During floods contaminated areas will spread bacteria through the whole flooded areas increasing the impact of open defecation and unhygienic environments. Micronutrient deficient diets of ch ildren under 5 years : Modified to: Poor quality diets of children under 5. There was discussion around this hypotheses in relation to a recent micronutrient survey. It was found that prevalence of iron and vitamin A deficiency is in fact not high . The micr onutrients of concern are: zinc and thiamine. Also discussion about how children's diets are deficient in protein, and poor quality. Practice of giving processed snack foods. Discussion on meal frequency with one participant reporting that most rural famil ies will only eat 2 meals a day. Agricultural dependence : Modified to: Agricultural dependence and poor crop diversity. Low diversity in markets causes low prices for rice and cassava, the common crops. Given this, this hypotheses will be renamed Decreasin g rural safety nets : Modified to: ' Poor resilience '. Extreme weather conditions such as floods and droughts are impacting livelihoods and food availability with loss and reduction of crops, and this is aggravating by decreasing rural safety nets, in part a lso a factor of climate change e.g. reduction of fish . This also encompasses a lack of technical skills and resources to cope with effects of weather extremes on crops. Discussion around the negative effects of flooding on access to clean water and unhygie nic areas. Low income and limited livelihoods : Added. It was highlighted that income affected a large majority of the proposed hypotheses e.g. household food insecurity, nutritional status of WCBA and WASH. Whereas 'rural poverty' had been combined with 'a gricultural dependence' as a risk factor, it was thought that low income, and limited access and diversity to livelihoods was multi -causal and should be a risk factor on its own. Specifically in its relation to WASH e.g. 20 access to household latrines. An exasperating factor is the practice of gambling, prostitution and alcoholism . Limited access to markets and poor infrastructure : Added. Remoteness of PVH and isolation of villages from each other was discussed. One of the reasons for this was thought to be p oor road access and linear layout of villages. Markets within villages do not always exist, and if they do are very small. Links to larger markets and markets in other villages do not seem to exist . This impacts on diversity of markets and hence diets, as well as limiting the economic productivity of agricultural products. Additionally, poor infrastructure impacts on access to villages in terms of health education and other beneficial programmes. One reason for this is thought to be a lack of investment fro m the government and limited commune budgets leading to basic services, poor infrastructure and limited development. 1.1.3. Rating of proposed hypotheses Technical experts gave individual ratings at the end of the workshop to each of the original hypothesised ri sk factors plus two hypotheses which were added during the workshop. The below is the rating key: 1-1.9 = Minor contributor to undernutrition in Preah Vihear 4-5 undernutrition in Preah Vihear The hypothesised risk f actor ratings are detailed in Table 4.

Nutrition vulnerable groups The following nutrition vulnerable groups were identified as nutrition vulnerable groups: children under 5 years ; pregnan t and lactating women; adolescent girls ; older people and elderly poor ; HHs with migrating members ; HHs vulnerable to flooding ; and, new villages with poor access to facilities 2. Characteristics of the studied population 2.1. Household composition In total, 810 households were visited, 355 had no child under 5 -years, and 20 refused to participate . In total 435 households completed the survey. In these 435 households, there wer e 542 children under 5 -years of which 253 were under 2 -years. The responding caregiver was the mother in the majority, 7% were gran dmothers, 0.2% were aunty or other female family member , and 0.2% were fathers. The average number of people in a household was 5.3 persons, a nd ranged from 2 to 13 persons. There was an average of 1.2 children under 5 years of age. 2.2. Number of community enquires The community enquires took place in four villages in Choam Ksant district. Table 5 details the number of FGDs and KIIs in each village, and the groups organised.

Overview of v illages from the qualitative enquiry The main activities in this area were farmi ng of rice and cassava. There was also a growing trend of casu al labour for construction work or cassava chopping. In addition, this area is rich in natural resources and the f orest is used to diversify livelihoods in many ways: collecting rubber from trees, collecting sap from trees, fishing, hunting, gathering of mushrooms and other wild foods, and collection of firewood . Distance to markets varied. Two villages were under 10 minutes from the market whereas one was over 1 hour from the market. This village, and others, had moto -markets (moto rbikes selling goods). Most households had livestock, which were often used as a safety net when needed. Poor households did not own much e lse in the way of assets. Some middle -wealth households owned hand tractors and/or motos . Almost all households seemed to have some size of land for farming. Water sources were mainly groundwater: handpumps, motorised pumps and wells. In addition one commu nity had water trucks for purchasing water from a pond . Some communities also used ponds, streams and lakes , this was more likely in the field and forests . Rain water was used in the wet season, some had roof rainwater storage and some used dug ponds, wher eas others stored this in the same clay jars as for groundwater sources. A minority of households had access to a latrine, open defecation was widespread in all communities. Distance to Health Centres varied, one village was 45 minutes from the nearest Hea lth Centre whereas others were 10 minutes. All villages had VHSG as a community health worker, but they varied in activity and capacity. 23 3. Undernutrition 3.1. Anthropometric results Table 6 presents the results of the SMART Survey of the Link NCA. According t o WHZ, Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM) prevalence is 6.7%, with 1. 3% of Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) cases. According to MUAC, GAM prevalence is 0.9%, with 0.2% SAM cases. Compared with the DHS 2014, the prevalence for GAM is much lower, this could be e xplained by the timing of the Link NCA as the study was not conducted at the peak of the lean season. However, the IMCF Baseline Survey 2013 was conducted in the lean season and found GAM to be 8.5% with 1.1% of SAM cases (n=1028)6. Stunting is also less t han DHS 2014, but still at a level of high prevalence of 34.9% according to the WHO thresholds. Underweight is at 22.5% with 3.7% of children severely underweight, slightly less than DHS figures.

Nutrition vulnerable groups During the Initial Stakeholder workshop, children under 2 years and children over 2 -years were identified as a nutri tionally vulnerable group. Figure 3 shows that SAM increases at 6 -17 months , moderate acute malnutrition rises after 30 -41 months. However, prevalence of GAM was low at 6.7% (n=31) and as such age groups contain small numbers. 6 A.

Figure 4 Prevalence of stunting by age group 3.3. Local d efinition of undernutrition Definitions of undernutrition varied across the four communities , but all had a common theme of 'not eating en ough' . In two communities this was specified as \" not eating enough nutritious foods \". In one community there was a common perception that poor linear growth was due to genetics, with the justification that the child is not sick, or does eat enough, but the y still don't grow tall. In three of the villages the role of hygiene or illness in poor child growth was also noticed. The following were the accepted definitions of undernutrition for the four villages: Poor growth due to not eating enough nutritious foo ds or due to your DNA. (Kouk Sralao) 25 A disease caused by not enough nutritious foods or unclean foods, which leads to poor growth. (Tmat Peuy) Poor growth due to not enough food, not enough sleep or poor hygiene. (Sok Senchey) When a child does not grow we ll or is not clever because they do not eat enough food or are ill a lot. (Svay) 3.3.1. Local p erception of undernutrition A common perception of undernutrition was not having enough food, or enough nutritious food. Nutritious foods were sometimes specified as ve getables. A less frequent perception was not having enough vitamins. Undernutrition was often described as a child being sick a lot or getting sick easily. Another common observation was when a child is eating a lot but still being small. Another was that a child does not want to eat. The most common w ords used to describe someone with undernutrition and short . There was also a frequent perception of not having 'clear skin'. Another common perception was having thin legs and arms with a big stomach. Different types of undernutrition were sometimes defined, in one community they differentiated being pale, weak and anaemic was differentiated from not growing properly. In another, as some children do not grow properly, some are stunted, some have yellow skin, and some are pale with no power. In one community, men had not heard of undernutrition , but were able to explain poor growth in children. \"Children are not growing equally. Know because not growing normally, sick a lot. Children not growing well look pale, eyes not bright, small legs and arms with big stomach, 'skom '\". (Fathers of children under 5, Svay Village) On talking with n utrition and health staff at local NGO s, some saw undernutrition as not eno ugh vitamins, poor nutrition or lack of sugar. They described children as having 'khan loung' meaning yellow skin and hair, as well as the same words as the community meaning: thin and small. 3.3.2. Local p erception of good nu trition Key informants , mothers and fathers in three villages perceived a good di et as fish, meat, green leafy vegetables, borbor, eg gs; fruit was sometimes mentioned. Rice was often only mentioned when promoted. In some villages there was much more of an emphasis on vegetables as the most important food for children for good health . There were many reports of chemicals on vegetables in all communities, with the perception that this was not good for child health. Therefore, some groups perceived home -grown foods as good for nutrition and health. In one village, perceptions differed. Both groups of mothers felt that a good diet was rice, borbor, breastmilk and bananas. Grandmothers mentioned only bananas when prompted for important food for children. In one v illage, poor -wealth mothers perceived infant formula to be good for children . In another village, grandmothers' perceived infant formula as the best food for a child, this knowledge came from the Market Sellers. Key people in one village felt good nutriti on was eating the 3 food groups: foods that build the body, foods that protect the body and foods that are for growth. This came up a number of times in the perception of causes of undernutrition also. 26 4. Food S ecurity and Liv elihoods 4.1. Community p ercepti on of food security and causes of poor food security Food insecurity was mainly perceived as not having enough foods. In one community , this was perceived to be due to problems with access when there was a lack of income, or depleting availability of wild foods. In another community , this was perceived as being due to low income for food expenditure, or low income meaning the need to sell rice crops and subsequently having insufficient rice stocks . Another perception of low food availability was due to poor crop yields and distance from markets. Extreme weather conditions were also link ed to having shortages of food by rice crops or homegardens being affected . Groups in one community talked about the fact that wild foods have become harder to find in recent years impacting on household food and income. 4.2. Findings for FSL Hypotheses 4.2.1. E. Mother's employment and seasonal migration A common discussion in communities was parents not having enough time to take good care of children because of work . This was seen as a reason for undernutrition, poor growth and poor hygiene practices ; three communities perceived mothers working to be a key reason for undernutrition in the community. In Preah Vihear/Stung Treng, 70.4% of women were employed , as the National stati stic. However , 78.4% of these women were working in agriculture compared to the national 43.7% .7 This was confirmed during community discussions, with almost all mothers working during the farming season. T here was also an increase in mothers seeking causa l labour in the dry season due to increased work opportunities and low household incomes . Both of these activities meant mothers were away from the household and not seeing their children for most of the day . Raising livestock and producing rice wine were the only home -based activities mentioned. \"Busy doing causal labour so not enough time to take care, or when go to field and leave child with other people, leads to undernutrition.\" (Mother, Svay) [Main problems with keeping child health]: \"income, so no time. Must spend time doing IGAs. No time to care, always go to the forest.\" (Fathers, Tmat Peuy The evidence base is mixed for the association between maternal employment and child's nutritional status, with some studies finding a positive relationship du e to the extra income and improved child spacing, and some a negative relationship due to the impact on feeding and care practices. Evidence 7 National Institu te of Statistics, Directorate General for Health, and ICF International, Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2014, 2015 27 shows that the relationship appears dependent on a number of factors: age of child, distance of work from home, typ e of secondary carer, and use of additional income .8 When a woma n possesses control of her income, it is more likely to improve the nutritional status of the child.9 The mother being the caregiver most of the time was identified as a positive deviant beha viour. However, Glick's review found that above 1 or 2 years -of-age maternal working was beneficial to nutritional status.10 In some communities surveyed during the Link NCA, mothers were returning to work when their child was 6 - 12-months . When the child was very young it was more likely for the mother to take t he child to work , which has also been identified as a risk factor for undernutrition .11 The alternative was that children were left at home with a secondary carer, usually the grandmother . Grandmothe rs were perceived to be less likely to practice appropriate feeding than mothers and had less knowledge of diarrhoea prevention. If a grandmother was not available, children were often left with older siblings . It has been shown that preteen carers lack th e maturity and knowledge to demonstrate positive child care practices .6 7In some households children were left unattended at the household whilst the parents went to the forest, fields, or for shorter times when collecting water. \"Children older than 12 -years look after younger children, especially in rainy and harvest season....Yes they will be feeding the child.\" (Mothers, Tmat Peuy) \"Mothers and fathers are busy. But still take care of children. Sometimes leave children alone but for only 1 -2 hours.\" (Heal th Post Staff, Tmat Peuy) The 2008 CFSVA found that 19% of households in Cambodia had a migrating member.12The RFS found that only 3.7% of caregiver respondents had migrated in the last 12 months despite this being a highlighted risk factor by many Key Info rmants in the preparatory stages (Table 7). The Link NCA community enquiries found that migration patterns var ied from community to community. In some communities, it was mainly older children and young adults who were migrating, whereas in others it was a lso parents , most often the father . \"Migration to Thailand and to Phnom Penh. Usually children, but also parents. If mother and father go, child usually stays with grandmother in the village. Usually go in the wet season after planting, then come back for harvest.\" (Key People, Sok Senchey) \"Some families migrate nearby for a few days, some men migrate further for 2 -3 weeks. Normally the husband.\" (Mother, Kouk Sralao) Table 7 Migration Indicators for 434 surveyed caregivers n Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI Migrated in the last 12 months 16 3.7 1.3 6.1 When mothers did migrate, some would migrate with their families and some would go alone, the RFS found this mixed behaviour (Figure 5). In some communities, migration of mothers was dependant on the age of the child. 8 PL.

O. Household Food Insecurity In all communities, food i s sourced throughout the year from the wild (leaves, vegetables, wild animals, fish and other aquatic species), homegardens and food markets. The majori ty of households owned chickens, used for consumption and sale . The majority of households grew rice for household consumption, some had enough land to feed their family , whereas some were too small or the crops were not growing well enough . The majority of households stocks ran out before the next harvest . Vegetables were not often grown as crops , but homeg ardens were present in some communities. In some villages, home gardens m ainly consisted of green leaves but in others there were also pumpkins and aubergines. Water shortages were the main barrier to growing homegardens . In one village, poor household s pla nted home gardens in the rainy season as they did not have water in the dry season, whereas middle -wealth household s planted in the dry sea son as they had more free time, using well or handpump water. 29 Community perceptions of undernutrition were mainly ar ound not having enough food to eat and subsequently household food insecurity was rated highly as a cause of undernutrition by communities. This was mainly linked with financial constraints to purchasing enough food or nutritious foods. Expensive foods wer e: meat, vegetables other than green leaves, fruits, seafood and infant formula. If extra income, mothers often responded they would purchase food. Table 8 shows the average household consumed 7food groups in the last 24 hours, indicating that in February -March the average household has acceptable access to diverse foods. Table 8 Indicators of food security in 435 RFS Households n Mean or Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI Provincial data FCS (%) Poor (0 -25) 9 2.1 0.1 4.0 13.3513 Borderline (25 -38.5) 29 6.7 3.6 9.8 Acceptable (> 38.5) 397 91.3 86.9 95.6 86.655 HDDS (Mean (SE)) 435 7.0 (0.2) 6.6 7.4 6.1314 MAHFP (Mean (SE)) 435 10.5 (0.2) 10.1 10.9 - As well as financial constraints, there were problems with accessing markets in some communities. The RFS found 36.1% of households had a market in the village (Table 16). During the community enquiries, the nearest market to one village was 45km away. This community would purchase foods from daily m otorised -mark ets in the village and travel to big markets 1 -2 times a month. Households were more reliant on gathering of foods from the wild such as fish, f rogs, snails, and green leaves. Another community experienced seasonal difficulties as when there was a lot of r ain the roads to the market became inaccessible. It was also difficult to gather foods and work in this time. Food prices increased in the village shops due to poor availab ility of food in the community. Table 9 presents consumed food groups with incre asing food access. As household food access increased, vegetables became more accessible, followed by meat, fruit and sugary foods. Only those with highest food access had consumed oils and fats, eggs and pulses. Even though it was common for households to own chickens and ducks, in two communities eggs were kept to hatch with this seen as more of a priority than consumption ; only one -third of households had consumed eggs.

Reinbott et al, Cambodia in Preah Vihear and Otdar Meanchey P rovinces: Cross -sectional Nutrition Base line Survey, 2013 30 The Cambodian Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis ( CFSVA) estimated that nationally 65% of calorific intake is made up of rice.15The RFS results agree with that found by the IMCF Baseline Survey 2013, in that the most consumed food groups were: Cereals, Condiments, Fish, Seafood and Snails (Figure 7). The RFS also found sugary foods as one of the most consumed food groups. Around two -thirds of households in the RFS consumed flesh meats in the previous 24 -hours. The least consumed groups were milk and milk products, insects, organ meats, vitamin -A rich fruits, vitamin -A rich vegetable s and white roots. There were frequent reports of chemical contamination of vegetables from the market. It was thought to be a cause of poor growth and health. In some communities this was a hindrance to purchasing vegetables with increased reliance on hom egardens and wild foods, which are pred ominantly green leaves. Figure 7 shows that whereas over 60% of households consumed green leafy vegetables, only 40% consumed other types of vegetables. Figure 7 Percentage of households consu ming specified food groups in the previous 24 -hours The Food Consumption Score (FCS) found 91.3% of households had acceptable food co nsumption over the last 7 days, with only 2.1% classified as poor food consumption, implying high food insecur ity (Table 8). This is similar to the Cambodia CFVSA which found nationally 88.9% of households to h ave acceptable and 4.1% to have poor food consumption. Despite reasonable statistics for the HDDS and FCS, it must be considered that the Link NCA was not conduced at the peak of the lean season, and as such it can be inferred tha t these statistics may present more food insecurity during the lean season . The IMCF Baseline survey was conducted in the lean season, and reported a slightly lower average HDDS of 6.13. The MAHFP shows that on average households have adequate food provisioning for 10.5 months of the year. During community enquiries, some communities perceived themselves to be often short of foods, frequently eating basic foods such as rice with salt and chilli , or rice with prahok16, whereas others did not perceive food shortages as a major problem. Figure 8 shows that the months where the most households experienced food shortages were September and October , prior 15 World Food Programme, Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA): Cambodia, 2008 16 Fermented fish paste 31 to the harvest, in the previous 12 months. The IMCF Baseline Survey also found the hunger mo nths were September and October .17 Figure 8 Percentage of households with inadequate food provisions, by month Reported f ood shortages were often shortages of rice at the households pre-harvest. With the rice harvest i n November to December , this is reflected in the results in Figure 8. Table 10 presents reported barriers to food access and availability of all foods dependent on the season. In the majority, foods were purchased more in t he dry season when there was less wild food availability, creating a risk of food shortage for poor households. Food availability is closely related to market prices, increasing in the dry season when there is less food available and more households are pu rchasing. Table 10 Barriers to food availability and access, by season Dry season (harvest, and non -busy period) (October - April) Rainy season (farming season) (May -October) Shortage of wild foods Rice shortages pre -harvest Short age of fish Time constraints to gathering, hunting and fishing More purchasing of foods from markets and shops Rice prices increase pre -harvest Food prices increase Poor access to markets, access to forests when heavy rain (some) Livestock disease Food availability was affected by extreme weather events. In villages where there had been droughts , there were discussions on poor rice crops, death of livestock, and a shortage of fish. Additionally, wild foods were perceived in all communities to be less a vailable than past years because of deforestation. In one community, they observed increased purchasing due to the decreasing availability of wild foods. When people do not have enough food, they cook rice as porridge, cook smaller family food, and use wha t they have available or can find through fishing or gathering. One group mentioned they 17 A. Reinbott et al, IMCF Cambodia in Preah Vihear and Otdar Meanchey P rovinces: Cross -sectional Nutrition Basel ine Survey, 2013 32 would kill a chicken. Often households will eat only rice with salt and chilli, or rice with 'prahok' (preserved sauce made of fish ). Prahok is prioritised in some com munities for purchase in times of financial constraint; in one community they would prioritise the purchase of vegetables as well. Evidence for the association between food security and child undernutrition is lacking, in part due to the difficulty assessi ng food security. However, a study in Bangladesh found that underweight and stunting was significantly lower in food -secure households.18 However, a recent study in Cambodia found that risk of maternal thinness and anaemia increased as food insecurity incre ased, but there were no associations with child nutrition status.19 Figure 9 presents the pathway by which household food insecurity increases the risk of undernutrition for children and women of child -bearing age. Figure 9 Causal p athway of Household Food Insecurity to increased risk of malnutrition 4.2.3. P. Agricultural dependence and poor crop diversity In the community enquiry, the main livelihoods discussed were farming and causal labour , the RFS shows that causal labour is not ofte n the main source of income (Table 1 1). Compared with the IMCF Baseline Survey in 201320, there is less dependence on sale of agricult ural products, with the Link NCA population showing a larger number of households to depend on employment/salary as the mai n source of income. Despite this, sale of agricultural products is still the main reported source of income at 37.0 %. This is similar to the National statistics, with the Cambodia Socio -Economic Survey 2014 finding 45.3% of households in Cambodia to be wor king in agriculture.21 As well as reliance on agricultural crops for income, communities rely on rice crops for staple food . The majority of households discussed taking loans. Often this was at the beginning of the farming season, but in some communities it was throughout the year. The majority of households relied on sale of agricultural products to repay these loans. Therefore, w hen crops do not grow households are 18 KK Saha, Household Food Security was Associated with Growth of Infants and Young Children in Rural Bangladesh, FASEB J, 2008 19 CM McDonald et al., Household food insecurity and dietary diversity as correlates of maternal and child undern utrition in rural Cambodia, Eur J Clin Nutr, 2015. 20 A.

Additionally, income historically spent on the household was being spent on repayments. Coping mechanisms discussed were taking another loa n, sale of livestock, sale of fo rest items, or causal labour.

More farmers had begun to grow cassava in recent years, diversified livelihoods in the ar ea either by direct cassava growing or by providing causal labour for other members of the community . In one community, men ha d noticed that as more peo ple began to grow cassava, the prices were decreasing. Water access was the main barrier for growing different crops , there was no discussion on irrigation systems . A second barrier was r oaming animals destroying fruit and vegetable crops. This hypothesis impacts on Hypothesis O. and Hypothesis T. as dependence on agricultural products for income and food stocks causes households to be vulnerable when extreme weather conditions and other shocks effect agricultural production . Meaning if households have insufficient safety nets or coping mechanisms, this can lead to financial difficulties and food insecurity. Heavy reliance on agriculture was evident in two of the communities where t he Link NCA conducted community enquiries; poor crop diversity was evident in all. Communities rated this risk factor highly as a cause for undernutrition as if they had no crops; they had no food or income. Figure 10 presents the causal pathway by which agricultural depe ndence and low crop diversity lead to an increased risk of malnutrition . 34 Figure 10 Causal pathway for Agricultural dependence and poor crop diversity to undernutrition 4.2.1. T. Low income and limited livelihoo ds Only one source of income was reported in 53.8% of households (Table 1 2). A main source of income that was likely dependent on the season (agricultural and forest -based employment) was reported in 52.6% of households (Table 11). In the DHS 74.4% of Prea h Vihear/Stung Treng were in the lowest two of five wealth quintiles, compared to 40.0% nationally. In the RFS, a subjecti ve Poverty Score was calculated based on ownership of cows, chickens, land for cash crops, hand tractor, motorbike, materials of house hold roof and floor, and fuel used for cooking; 75.7% were categorised as poor - wealth households. All communities rated this risk factor highly as a cause for undernutrition in their community as there was no money for food. Fathers in one community linked poor growth to underlying household wealth and its effect on household food, sanitation and hygiene . \"Children in poor families not growing properly - may not eat enough food. Middle families eat enough, and diverse food. Also sanitation, middle families have toilets. If lack sanitation then many types of diseases and sick frequently. Also in poor families, parents go away for labour. If at home then can clean and wash hands.\" (Father, Sok Senchey) Table 12 Income indicators for th e 436 surveyed households n Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI No. of incomes 0 1 0.2 -0.2 0.7 1 234 53.8 45.7 61.9 2 164 37.7 30.6 44.8 3 34 7.8 5.3 10.3 Subjective Poverty Scorea Poor -wealth 243 75.7 69.9 81.5 Middle -wealth 54 16.8 12.3 21.4 Rich-wealth 24 7.5 1.7 13.1 a Calculated on assets & quality of living. Thresholds determin ed during community discussions 35 As discussed under Hypothesis P. , the main ways to generate income were: sale of agricultural products, salary/employment, small business and causal labour. During community enquiries, people discussed sale of wild foods and animals, and non -food forest products to diversify incomes . In one community mothers discussed sale of vegetables, but they did not have market stalls so were selling at lower prices. In one military village, an estimated 50% of the men were employed by the military. The RFS only collected information on migration on caregivers, w hich was low, however many discussed household members, mainly fathers and older children, migrating for work. Many household i ncomes were unreliable or seasonal , with s ale of r ice or vegetables only if enough was produced, and frequent poor crops Cassava farming was not accessible to all poor households, although community members were working as causal labourers for 'cassava chopping'. Agricultural products were often sold immediately after harvest, when prices were lowest. Livestock disease made sale of livestock unreliable. In one community they discussed not being able to sell their animals at certai n times of the year as they had diseases. In the dry season, 8.8% of households' main income was sale of forest products but for many more this was a secon d/third income. One community acknowledged the impact reduced availability of these products was having on income s. \"Income has changed: used to be easy to find food and things to generate money. Now it's difficult. Income a year much less than 5 years ag o.\" (Mother, Tmat Peuy) Incomes were seen by almost all groups as reducing over the years. However, o ne group of mothers felt that their i ncome was increasing as there were more opportunities for generating money for women, such as causal labour. Groups wh o perceived their income as decreasing felt this was due to poor crop yields with the increasing effects of climate change , decreasing prices of rice and cas sava, and less availability of forest products to sell. With increased borrowing of money, more peo ple in the community were using income generate from sale of agricultural products for repayments. \"Decreasing income means: not enough money to pay debts, not enough money to buy food, not enough money for healthcare when child is sick, not enough money t o repair machinery for agriculture. Most lead to increased borrowing of money.\" (Father, Svay) [Agricultural products income] \"Lasts long time if don't need anything, but if need to buy something not long, and if need to repay debt then not long.\" (Mother , Tmat Peuy) Evidence on the association of undernutrition with household socio -economic status and wealth is strong . A meta -analysis showed that household income had the largest impact on child nutrition out of a number of biological, demographic and soci ological factors.22 Limited livelihoods and poor incomes could be having an effect on the outcomes of the whole community with Yang finding that village income had a greater positive effect than household income on exclusive breastfeeding, drinking boiled w ater, handwashing with soap, and reducing stunting.23. Figure 11 presents the causal pathway for low income and limited livelihoods to undernutrition. 22 R. Charmarbagwala et al., The determinants of child health and nutrition: A Meta -analysis, 2014 23 C Yang et al., Effect of village income and household income on sanitation facilities, hygiene behaviours and child undernutrition during rapid economic g rowth in a rural cross -border area, Yunnan, China., J Epidemiol Community Health, 2009 36 Figure 11 Causal pathway of low income and limited to undernutrition 4.2.2. Q. Poor resilience Large numbers of households had experienced negati ve effects of climate change, extreme weather events, and deforestation on their livelihoods (Table 13 ). This was confirmed during community discussions, with all communities discussing the effects on their crops and availability of foods. There seemed to have been one bad flood in the past 5 years which had destroyed crops and some roads , but more frequently reported was the effects o f droughts and poor rains . Compared to National statistics on exposure to floods and droughts, both at 11%, Choam Ksant is more vulnerable to these24 . Although limited, there is evidence to show a link between weather and stunting.25 [Cope with droughts/poor rains] \"Borrow money from organisation or bank to do farm ing. When crops die, take another loan to pay this one off. Take longer term loan to give time for causal labour or to plan farming to repay.\" (Father, Sok Senchey ) In one community, there were a number of land conflicts including: between families, betwee n families and the military, and between families and private companies. With family and military conflicts, the land was usually split reducing the families land access. Table 13 Effects of extreme weather conditions and deforestat ion as perceived in the last two years by the 436 households surveyed Number of households experiencing: n Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI Negative effects of droughts on crops 236 66.7 57.1 76.2 Negative effects of floods on crops 126 35.7 26.9 44.5 A reduction in fish & aquatic species in the wild 186 79.8 68.1 91.5 A reduction in foods & animals from the wild 254 86.1 78.4 93.8 A reduction in non -food items from the wild 176 81.9 70.5 93.2 24 World Food Programme, Comprehensive Food Security and Vulnerability Analysis (CFSVA): Cambodia, 2008 25 RK Phalkeya et al., Systematic review of current efforts to quan tify the impacts of climate change on undernutrition, PNAS Plus, 2015. Accessed at: www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1409769112 37 Historically, natural resources have been used as a safety net when shocks occur . In times of financial strain and food insecurity , wild foods, animals and fish are often sought for sale or consumption . However, over 80% of respondents had noticed a reduction in wild foods and animals, and non -food produ cts in the wild. Livestock were a nother commonly reported safety net when the household needed money. However , livestock disease was very common and animal deaths were happen ing yearly. Communities d id not have resources or knowledge to prevent or trea t animal disease. When there were droughts, livestock were getting diseases and dying . Other coping mechanisms when people did not have enough money were: doing causal labour or borrowing money. In the RFS, 53.8% [95% CI: 53.8; 45.9, n=234] reported having acc ess to cash, savings, or loans. In some communities loans were regularly taken before the farming season, in others it was if crops failed . In one community, people were borrowing money 2 -3 times a year. Loans were taken from banks or the microf inance inst itution , and loans wer e usually repaid ove r 2-3 years. One group would usually borrow from $250 -1000, and another group $250-500. \"If need money do causal labour, find crabs and frogs to sell, some borrow money from Vision Fund or Microfinance institution s.\" (Mother, Svay) If not able to repay loans, some took another loan with a longer repayment period , others would seek causal labour opportunities , many mentioned selling li vestock, and in one community selling land. As borrowing increas ed, incomes were reportedly decreasing and crops becoming more unreliable. Given the current coping mechanism this creates a reliance on: having livestock to sell and having opportunities for causal labour. All communities rated poor resilience as a main cause of undernutr ition, with the perception that extreme weather events and health problems caused financial constraints . Figure 12 shows the causal pathway from poor resilience to undernutrition. \"Borrow money from others or organisations. Take loan for 2 -3 years, 1 -2 million riel s. If have problems repaying, borrow from another for short ter m loan.\" (Mothers, Sok Senchey) Figure 12 Causal pathway of Poor resilience to child undernutrition 38 4.2.3. U. Limited access to markets and poor infrastructure Limited access to markets was evident in two of the communities where the Link NCA community enquiry was conducted. The RFS showed that 63.9% had no markets in the village and 34.7% had to travel for more than 30 minutes to access a market (Table 1 4). This is more than in the whole of Cambodia, with only 20% of villages having a market in 2008, although this statistic could be outdated26 . Table 14 Access to markets for the 435 households surveyed n Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Uppe r 95% CI Market in the village 157 36.1 20.6 51.6 Time to Market 418 <30 mins 273 65.3 51.5 79.1 30 mins - 2 hours 81 19.4 9.9 28.9 Half a day 19 4.5 1.0 8.1 More than half a day 45 10.8 3.2 18.3 Needing transport to markets far away increases th e cost of purchasing foods. There is reliance on prices set by village shops, motorised -markets, and traders which were perceived to be a bit more or much more expensive than larger markets. One communities nearest market was 47km away , and i n another the roads were poor meaning it became impossible to access the markets when heavy rain . In the community with consistently poor access to markets , there was more gathering of wild foods and animals , making them more vulnerable to the depletion of wild foods an d fish. Limited access to markets was due to remote villages with poor road access , which is also likely to impact on coverage of community programmes as well as other basic services and facilities. This is likely to impact on the resources and knowledge of the community . Figure 13 presents the causal pathway of limited access to markets and infrastructure to undernutrition. Figure 13 Causal pathway for limited access to markets and infrastructure to undernutrition 26 World Food Programme, Comprehensive Food Security and Vu lnerability Analysis (CFSVA): Cambodia, 2008 39 4.3. Relation with other sectors 4.3.1. WASH Water access w as a common constraint for: good crops , growing vegetables and other diversification of crops, as well as for keeping livestock. 4.3.2. Care practices Mother's employment and seasonal migration is closely related to care practice s of young children. With the majority of mothers working in the farming season, and more mothers beginning to do causal labour, more mothers are spending time away from their young children. This was closely linked w ith income in many communities. 5. Heal th 5.1. Health Context Health Centres ranged from being close to very far to com munities. Cambodia has the Health Equity Fund which supports households defined as ID Poor to access health services. However, according to the DHS 2015, only 3.6% used the Health E quity fund for illness or injury in the previous 30 days. In each community there was a Village Health Support Group (VHSG) who provides some level of health support to the community. Child illness was common in all communities. Poor health was perceived by communities as being caused by poor hygiene, sanitation, care practices, and diets in terms of nutritious foods and eating enough, as well as drinking of unsafe water , with many giving financial reason s for these poor practices. A number of group s perc eived that flies and/or chickens spread diseases from faeces in the environment to the household. Challenges to good health were perceived as income and having high workloads. 5.2. Findings for Health hypotheses 5.2.1. A. High risk for mosquito -borne disease in child ren under 5 years All communities understood that malaria and dengue were caused by mosquito bites. The maj ority identified fever or high body temperature as symptom s. All communities reported having mosquito nets, with families sleeping all together under neath. Table 15 shows that 97.4% of respondents in the RFS had a mosquito net prese nt where their children under 5 -years were sleeping. The evidence for malaria causing weight loss is strong, however less so for poor linear growth. Malaria causes weight lo ss due to symptomatic vomiting and anorexia.27 Malaria also increases the risk of other infection and malarial anaemia, impacting on 27 RW. Snow et al., Relation between severe malaria morbidity in children and level of Plasmodium falciparum transmission in Africa , Lancet, 1997 40 healthy development.28 Malaria in pregnancy increases the risk of maternal anaemia and significantly increases the risk of ha ving a baby at low birthweight.29 Low birth weight babies are nine times more likely to die in their first month s of life than normal -weight babies. Table 15 Proportion of 528 surveyed children under 5 -years with risk factors for ma laria or dengue fever Of children under 5 -years, the number who had: n Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI Provincial data Mosquito net where they slept 528 97.4 95.9 98.9 99.7a, 30 Fever in the last 14 days 289 53.3 48.2 58.3 32.631 a Statistic for number of households with mosquito net In most communities, when a child had fever they would be taken to the Health Centre. The RFS found 53.3% of children to have had a fever in the last 14 days, with 60.1% of caregivers reporting taking their child to the Health Centre when they last had fever , but 25.4% a Private Clinic . Some mothers reported using paracetamol to begin, and then going to the Health Centre. Convulsions and unconsciousness, two possible symptoms of malaria, were both illnesses that many community mem bers thought were due to bad spirits and needed a traditional healer. [Bad spirit] :\"Depends on whether believer or not. When child gets high temperature, or unconscious, think bad spirits. Sometimes its malaria.\" (VHSG, Svay) \"Some come to me for treatment for malaria, sometimes they get better but sometimes they don't. If they don't get better I advise them to go to the Health Centre. But many get better, and that's why they believe.\"(Traditional Healer, Tmat Peuy) In two of the Link NCA comm unity enquiries , it seemed that children rarely had dengue or malaria, in the other two communities it was common for children at certain times of the year. In some communities, it was seen as more common for adults due to the fact that they worked in the forest . During the far ming season, some families slept in the field increasing the ir risk of malaria or dengue, some families would take the ir children with them , however in the rainy season children were more likely to be left at the village with a second ary carer. Some families reported having a small house with a mosquito net in the field. Malaria and dengue were perceived to be highest in the rainy season . As women continue to work whilst pregnant, the effects of malaria could also be evident in utero . Figure 14 presents the causal pathway of malaria and dengue to undernutrition. 28 OK. Kai & DJ.

B. High prevalence of illness in children under 5 -years Under 2 -years of age, infection is very common. The immune system requires nutrients to fight infections, meaning when there are repeated bouts of infection , micronutrients become deficient and are not available for healthy growth and development.32 Among positive deviants, the ir child ren were not sick a lot . All four communities perceived child illness to be a main cause of undernutrition. Common child illnesses discussed in the Link NCA communities were: diarrhoea, vomiting, fever, respiratory disease, stomach aches, intestina l problems, coughs, and cold, and in some dengue and malaria . On prompting, it seemed that children also suffered from parasitic worms. Knowledge of causes of specific illnesses varied amongst communities, and amongst groups in the communities. All but one community knew some accurate causes of diarrhoea . Knowledge of causes and prevention of vomiting, coughs and colds was limited across all communities with the change in weather being the most common ly perceived cause. Mothers in one community discussed breastmilk spoiling from being in the sun as a cause of fever. Parasitic worms were perceived to be caused by too much meat and playing on th e ground. \"Children do not often get diarrhoea. Caused by eating food not good for them e.g. orange juice drink or sn acks. \" (Grandmother, Sok Senchey) \"Diarrhoea caused by eat ing dirty food, don't wash hands. If poor, use traditional medicines, with advice from elders. If have money go to Health Centre. Get when weather changes in December. \" (Mothers, Tmat Peuy) The RFS shows that 68.3% of children under 5 -years were reported to have had symptoms of Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) defined as an illness with a cough (trouble breathing or breathe faster than usual with short, quick breaths) in the past 14 days , this is much higher than any other reported statistics and as such is not considered reliable (Table 16) . In the IMCF Baseline 201 3, 46% of children were suffering from a cough with just 9.9% having signs of ARI. This indicates that the results from the 32 KG. Dewey & DR. Mayers, Early child growth: how do nutrition and infection interact?, Matern Child Nutr, 2 011 42 Link NCA ma y be representative of children with a cough in the last 14 days. Studies on the effects of ARI on child nutrition show it has a negative effect on weight gain, however its effect on linear growth are less clear.33 Diarrhoea in children has been shown to be a strong predictor of stunting and wasting34, the RFS shows 34.1% of children under 5 -years to have had diarrhoea in the past 14 -days, much higher than the DHS National statistic of 13% (Table 16) . In most communities, the majority of mothers were seeking timely health advice. The RFS shows that when their child last had diarrhoea or fever, 60% sought treatment at th e Health C entre ( Figure 17 ). There were frequent reports of stomach ache and intestinal problems in children , which could be symptomati c of env ironmental enteropathy, a condition caused when there is frequent exposure to faecal -oral contamination. Given the high levels of open defecation and poor handwashing after defecation, it could be anticipated that this exists for many children in the community. Environmental enteropathy has been shown to be associated with malnutrition in children .35 36 Table 16 Child Health Indicators for 528 children under 5 -years n Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI Provincial data CDHS 2014 Diarrhoea in the last 14 days 185 34.1 28.8 39.5 19.0 Fever in the last 14 days 289 53.3 48.2 58.3 32.6 ARI in the last 14 days 370 68.3 64.2 72.3 1.7 Received deworming medication in the past 12 months 229 42.3 37.5 47.0 62.2 DPT3 60.7 69.4 68.6a a national statistic for children 12 -23 months With unhygienic environments and poor hand practices there is a high risk of parasitic worms in children in these communities, and 57.7% of children under 5 -years h ad not received deworming medication in the last 12 months , more than the 41.3% nationally in the last 6 months (Table 1 6).37 Deworming medication was given during yearly vaccinatio n campaigns in the communities, 60.7% of children under 5 years had a DPT3 vaccination according to a vaccination card. In the DHS 2014, they found that 68.6% of children aged 12 -23 months had been vaccinated with DPT3 according to vaccination cards, and an additional 15.1% were self -reported. Given the similarity in the Link NCA and DHS statistics, this can likely be used as an estimate for those without vaccination cards having received the DPT3 vaccination.

C. Delivery without skilled professional The RFS found 29% of mothers delivered t heir last child at home (Table 17 ). However, during the community enquiries, the T raditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) did not seem to be active in delivering or assisting in births anymore and the Key People and Health staff discussed that less mothers were delivering at home than in previous years, with the inference that this trend is decreasing. Those mothers who had delivered at home were often due to the birth being 'quick'. After giving birth, the baby was taken to the Health Centre for injections in all reported home birth cases. Table 17 Indicators of Heal th Access n Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI Provincial data CDHS 2014a Location of last delivery Hospital 50 11.5 6.9 16.1 49.3 Health Centre 252 57.9 48.9 67.0 Home 126 29.0 18.0 40.0 48.4 Private Centre 6 1.4 0.0 2.7 1.8 Other 1 0.2 -0.2 0.7 0.1 Birth assistance by skilled health professional 435 72.9 63.0 82.7 54.4 a Live births in the last 5 years The majority of mothers had decided to deliver at the Health Centre at the advice of the Nurses at the Health Centre an d/or VHSGs. Mothers saw the Health Centre as the safest option for delivery. In two communities mothers discussed not being able to afford the injections after delivery and instead carrying out the cultural practice of lying on a bed with a fire underneath for 3 days known as 'ang pleung' or 'roasting' , with the belief that this was an alternative to injections and would aid healing 44 and improve long -term health. In one case the mother explained how the grandmother had taken the newborn baby to the Health C entre after the home birth and she had stayed at home to carry out this practice . Figure 16 presents the causal pathway to undernutrition. Figure 16 Causal pathway for delivery without skilled professional increasing risk of child u ndernutrition 5.2.1. G. Lack of exposure to skilled Health Advice Lack of exposure to skilled healt h advice constitutes a number of healthcare factors: use of health care and health seeking behaviour, coverage of community health acti vities, and quality of ca re at Health C entre s. UNICEF highlights a lack of Health care servi ces for prevention or treatment as one of the ma in underlying causes of disease, a nd as detailed under Hypothesis B. illness is a risk factor for child undernutrition. Studies have found t hat improved exposure to health care and education has a positive effect on child growth.38 39 A randomised trial showed that including a nu trition -education component to Health C entre programmes aimed at new mothers, de creased risk of stunting when the child was 6 -8 months onwards, however there was no significant impact on weight ( p<0.05).40 Nurses and midwives at the Health Centre were often the main source of advice on health and nutrition in communities. However outre ach activities were minimal so this exposure was often limited to self-presenting at the Health Centre, either through ANC, PNC or health issues. Communities perceived that the majority of mothers attended ANC, the RFS shows 87.1% of caregivers had attende d ANC for their last pregnancy (Table 18 ). However, o nly 54.1% attended at least four sessions. Health staff perceived there to be less attendance at PNC. In some communities, mothers would only go to PNC if there was a medical problem. 38 M. Lagarde, A. Haines & N.

They varied in capacity , some having good knowledge a nd activity in the community whilst others appeared to play a minor rol e. In some they were giving advice, in one the VHSG was conducting Mother 's Support Groups. VHSGs were mostly advising mother s to go to the Health Centre when the child was sick and supporting the Health Centre staff when there were community immunisation campaigns. C ommunities were engaged on this topic with mothers perceiving immunisations as beneficial. There were still a minority who did not want their children to be immunised due to the side -effects. The National Nutrition Strategy for Cambodia in 2009 highlighted the problem that Health Centre outreach sessions were primarily on immunisations, with minimal time spent in each village. This problem still appears to exist in the Link NCA study area. Additionally, NGO activities were scattered in the area. \"Some mothers don't believe in immunisations as they cause side effects and make them have to take time off work to look after child. \"(Key people, Kouk Sralao Village) \"Immunisations are a good thing, when child gets sick it's easy to cure. \" (Mother, Kou k Sralao) Financial and transportation barriers were the most commonly reported challenges to accessing the Health Centre (Table 18 ). The DHS found that 3 in 4 respondents had challenges accessing the Health Centre which is similar to what the Link NCA fin ds. Many mothers reported borrowing money from neighbours to access healthcare when needed, as well as selling livestock or rice. In households with challenges in accessing healthcare , there was more practice of initially seeking traditional treatments or self-medicating. Additionally, traditional treatments were sought if the Health Centre treatment was not working or they were not able to provide any treatment. If a child was not getting better, the frequent belief was that bad spirits were the cause of the illness. There were also certain illnesses which were believed to be better treated by traditional healers: stomach ache, convulsions, unconsciousness, and when a child cried a lot. In some communities, this also included fever. In one 46 village, i f the t raditional healer's attempts at helping the child did not work, they would refer the child to a more k nowledgeable traditional healer or to the Health Centre. \"Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. If it doesn't work he will advise the mother to con sult a more knowledgeable traditional healer in the village.\" (Traditional Healer, Svay) During community enquiries , the majority of mothers reported taking the ir child to the Health C entre when they w ere sick . Figure 17 shows that 60% of car egiver s took t heir children under 5 -years to the Health Centre when they last had diarrhoea and fever , very similar to DHS National statistics . However, 24 -25% took their child to a Private Clinic, a potentially risky practice as Private Clinics are not regulated and ar e often run out of people's households. Figure 17 Treatment sought by caregivers for diarrhoea and fever in children under 5 -years Figure 1 8 presents the pathway by which lack of exposure to health advice increases the risk of child undernutrition. Figure 18 Causal pathway of lack of exposure to health advice to child undernutrition 47 5.3. Relation with other sectors 5.3.1. FSL Frequent child illness impacts on the financial state and vulnerability of a househol d. Households with poorer wealth are at higher risk of poor food security and higher risk of poor nutritional status. Illness is often linked with change in weather throughout the year, with increasing frequency of extreme temperatures this is perceived to be causing more illness. 5.3.2. Care practices and IYCF There were some households who slept at the fields during the busy periods, increasing the risk of exposure to mosquitos and drinking untreated water . There was a p erception that too much meat causes parasi tic worms, and chemicals on vegetables cause poor health . These two perceptions are likely to impact on the meat and vegetable intake of children . Increasing Health Centre births means increased exposure to a Health Professional s for advice on IYCF and car e practices shortly after birth . 5.3.3. WASH The environment is at high risk of faecal contamination, resulting in high risk of gastro -intestinal infections . Handwashing after defecation is poor , increasing the risk of faecal -oral contamination and illness. Hous ehold are not consistently treating water before drinking , un clean water is likely to contain germs and bacteria, and cause illness. 6. Care practices & Maternal Health 6.1. Child Care Practices and IYCF Context The National Nutrition Programme (NNP) has produc ed a Nutrition Road Map for Cambodia with one of its six components as \"Improve and accelerate the national campaign on exclusive breastfeeding and complementary feeding campaign \". This follows 10 -years of promoting breastfeeding through a strategy which i ncluded changes at policy -level, health -system level and community level. The rate of exclusive breastfeeding has increased from 11% in 2000 to 74% in 2010, however it then decreased to 65% in 2014 . From 2010 to 2015, children reaching the recommended Mini mum Dietary Diversity (MDD) have increased from 36.9% to 47.6%, whereas Minimum Meal Fr equency (MMF) has stayed the same from 74.5% to 72.2%.41 41 National Institute of Statistics, Directorate General for Health, and ICF International, Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2014, 2015 48 6.2. Findings for Care practices and IYCF Hypotheses 6.2.1. D. Early Child Bearing The culture in Cambodia is to have a chi ld soon after marriage, with the reported av erage age for a first child from 18 - 20 years. Table 19 shows that 9.4 % of the caregivers in the RFS had their first chil d when they were younger than 18 years. Nationally, according to the DHS 2014, 12.0% of 15 -19 year olds had begun childbearing compared to 25.1% for Preah Vihear/Stung Treng. It has been shown that, in some contexts, children who are severely underweight are more likely to have mothers under 19 years, there is more chance of her not being ready or mature enough to care for a child.42 Table 19 Proportion of 434 caregivers whose first child was classified as early childbearing n Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI CDHS 2014 Younger than 1 8 years at birth of first chil d 41 9.4 5.7 13.2 10.5a a 25-49 year olds who gave birth by age 18 -years Most mothers thought the best age to have a first child was 18 -20 years old. In one discussion one mother said 15 -years as then she will have a 10 -year old to help her when she is 25 -years old, but other mothers in the group disagreed and felt that at 20-years women are strong and mature enough to have a child. The decision to have a child was perceived as being made by a discussion between the husband and wife. In one group, the moth ers discussed how it was not a decision, but it happened by chance; even if they were using contraceptives. Figure 19 presents the causal pathway from early child bearing to increased risk of child undernutrition. Figure 19: causal pathway of early child bearing to increased risk of child undernutrition 6.2.1. F. Gender issues and maternal well being High household workload, poor women's empowerment and maternal mental health have all been shown to impact on a child's wellbeing. Risk of depression was very high in the RFS, with 55.2% of caregivers being classified as at risk of depression (Table 20) . A meta -analysis found a moderate linear but significant association between maternal depressio n with underweight and stunting, however 42 B Nahar et al., Risk Factors Associat ed with Severe Underweight among Young Children Reporting to a Diarrhoea Treatment Facility in Bangladesh, J Health Popul Nutr, 2010 49 there were a number of problems with the quality and comparability of individual studies.43 One study found that household food insecurity, poor mental health, and socioeconomic status had independent and negative impacts on children's weight for age.44 Another s tudy found no significant effects of maternal depression on the WAZ or HAZ of their infants at 6 months.45 The Provincial Department of Women's Affairs (PDWA) had noticed families which were very poor but were satisfied as they had respect in the family . Save the Children also found parents desired good relationships and stress -free lives over wealth however, they frequently worried about having resources to properly care for their children .46 Culturally in Cambodia women keep the household money, however d ecision making for women varied from com munity to community. In all communities, small day -to-day household decisions were made by the wife. Some mothers felt they had equal decision making power to their husbands, but in most communities the husband would still have the final decision . In one community, women felt their husband made all the decisions. \"For big decisions there is a discussion between husband and wife. Final decision is husbands. For small decisions, women can decide alone.\" (Mothers, Svay) \"Husband makes most of the decisions in the household. Wife can make some decisions after discussion with husband, but just small de cisions.\" (Mother, Sok Senchey) Table 20 Indicators of maternal wellness for 434 caregivers n Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI Risk of depression (WHO513) 240 55.2 50.0 60.3 Less than 40 days rest after delivery 372 85.7 82.4 88.99 Perceived social capita - Not at all 72 16.6 9.1 24.0 Not very 138 31.7 24.0 39.4 Somewhat 89 20.5 14.6 26.3 Very 136 31.3 19.1 43.4 Marital arguments were frequent in all communities. Common reasons for arguments were: alcohol use, not having enough money, and not having enough food, the most com mon discussion b eing about arguments when the husband had been drinking alcohol. Despite the DHS showing Preah Vihear/Stung Treng to have the highest rates of domestic violence, this was reported as happening sometimes in the majority of communities. When violence did happen in a family, intervention o f the Village Chief or police was only if serious. The PDWA thought that communities perceived domestic violence as bad for the reputation of the family and would therefore not tell anyone. They also perceived domestic violence to be reducing due to increa sed awareness and increasing education. \"Frequent arguments in village. Argue about alcohol, not helping with household work, not having enough to eat, jealousy ......Some people can have violence ......feel worried and afraid that may happen to us ......community tel l commune head or report to police.\" (Mothers, Svay) 43 PJ Surkan et al.

BMJ open, 2012 46 The Manoff Group and Save the Children Cambodia, Understanding the Contex t for Promoting Nutrition -Enhancing Behaviours among Households with Severe Resource Constraints, NOURISH Project, 2015 50 The RFS found that 48.3% of caregivers perceiving having 'none ' to 'not very much ' support (Table 20). Support was not specified, and was down to the respondents own pe rceptions . However, social capita l is thought to represent the quality and quantity of social relationships in a community of which the respondent can rely on for support, this can be economic, information or other types of support.47 One study found that families with more social capital we re better able to cope with weather shocks, however this was less so when the entire community suffered losses.48 Another study showed that existence of social capital from other individuals was associate d with child nutritional status .49 Mothers discussed b orrowing money or transportation when the family needed to access healthcare . Other support mentioned was borrowing rice o r food at times of household food insecurity. On an average day the husband was out of the house generating income . Husbands would hel p with heavy duties such as collecting water or firewood when they were at home , and sometimes childcare. However most mothers clarified this was only when they were at home, which was not often. When a husband migrated, this was increasing the household w orkload for mothers and affecting the care of children. Having support for child care was id entified as a positive deviant practice. In households with grandparents and/or older childr en, they were a main support to the mother with child care and household chores. \"When husband migrates, everything is wom an's responsibility. Have to collect all the water. Sometimes have to leave child alone.\" (Mother, Kouk Sralao) \"Men out of the house working. When home, exhausted so don't help much.\" (Mother, Sok Senche y) Mothers workload did not change during pregnancy in most cases, however many women stopped doing 'heavy work' towards the end of pregnancy. The RFS found 95.8% of caregivers rested for less than 40 days after th ey delivered their last child, an indicat ion of high maternal workload (Table 40) . Perception of maternal workload varied in communities, some mothers felt their workload was not too much and not too little but other mothers perceived themselves to be very busy. In one community, mothers related how busy they were to how much support they had from their children. Figure 20 presents the pathway of gender issues and poor maternal wellness to child undernutrition. \"Not very busy. If have children to help then not busy, but if don't then busy.\" (Moth er, Sok Senchey) 47 Sujarwoto et al., Child Health and Mothers' Social Capital in Indonesia through Crisis, 2011.

K. Inadequate breastfeeding practices Cambodia follows WHO recommendations on breastfeeding practi ces: breastfeeding should be initiated within the first 1 -hour of life; an infant should be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 -months of life; and, at 6 months complementary foods should be introduced whilst continuing to breastfeed to 24 -months . The ev idence for the protective effect of breastfeeding against illness is strong, however the evidence for improved nutritional status with prolonged breastfeeding over 1 -year is weak .50 51 For example, one study with data from South Asia and Sub -Saharan Africa f ound that breastfeeding was associated with lower stunting rates in Bangladesh while in Nigeria it was a risk facto r.52 The RFS shows that 96.1% of children under 2 -years were ever breastfed, and that 75.6% were breastfed yesterday (Table 21 ). Initiation of breastfeeding within 1 -hour of birth was 82.8% , more than the national level reported in the DHS of 63% . During the community enquiries there were discussions about nurses or midwives advising immediate initiation of breastfeeding and excl usive breastfeed ing to 6 -months at delivery . Table 21 Breastfeeding indicators for 254 children 0 -23 months n Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI CDHS 2014 Ever breastfed 244 96.1 93.5 98.6 98.9 Breastfed yesterday 192 75.6 67.6 83.6 - Breastfed within 1 hour of birth 202 82.8 78.5 87.0 77.3 Breastfed within less than 24 hours 232 95.1 92.2 97.9 97.7 Given the anticipated small sample sizes for the age groups needed for the indicators of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) , and continued breastfeeding at 1-year and 2 -years it was decided to explore these through the qualitative enquiry. In the IMCF Baseline 2013, EBF for Preah Vihear was 77.1 %.53 50 Kramer et al., Health and development outcomes in 6.5 -y-old children breastfed exclusively for 3 or 6 mo, Am J Clin Nutr , 2009 51 Lamberti et al. 2011, B reastfeeding and the risk for diarrhea morbidity and mortality, BMC Public Health, 2011 52 M Misselhorn, and K Harttgen, A Multilevel Approach to Explain Child Mortality and Undernutrition in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, Conference report, 2006 53 A. Reinbott et a l, IMCF Cambodia in Preah Vihear and Otdar Meanchey Povinces: Cross -sectional Nutrition Baseline Survey, 2013 52 Despite the fact that EBF is decreasing nationally , the majority of mothers in the Link NCA communit ies reported practicing EBF until their baby was 6-months old. Those who had not practiced EBF were due to problems with breastfeeding, or the perception that the child needed food with one mother giving 'borbor' (rice porridge) at her mother's advice . A very small number of mothers had given water or infant formula in the first 6 -months. There was only one reported practice of giving first foods other than breastmilk, this being condensed milk as the mother had no breastmilk. Health workers had recommended one mother use infant formula when she had twins, and i t was recommended when a 3 -month s old was very weak. Mothers see infant formula as expensive. In two communities, grandmothers perceive d infant formula as being very good for a baby. \"Best food for c hild under 6 months is infant formula. The seller at the market tells you if will make the child clever and grow quickly.\" (Grandmother, Kouk Sralao) Mothers who did not breastfed or EBF often reported problems with breastfeeding. They discuss ed not having anyone to ask for advice. In some communities, traditional healers were consulted for traditional medicin es. One healthcare worker had observed that mothers were breastfeeding their children too much, for example every time they cried, and it was making t hem vomit. \"Yes I had problems with breastfeeding....no I didn't ask anyone for advice. I stopped breastfeeding and gave borbor.\" (Mother, Tmat Peuy) The IMCF Baseline found Continued 1 -year was 93% for Preah Vihear/Odtar Meanchey. In the co mmunity enquiries, mo thers mainly reported stop ping breastfeeding because they we re busy or because they want ed their child to eat more foods. In two communities mothers had stopped at 18 -24 months. In another community , one group of mothers stop ped breast feeding around 12 -14 months, as they were working outside and they explained their milk was getting hot, which was thought to be bad for the child 's health . In another community, one group of mothers stopped breastfeeding when the child was big enough, thi s was perceived to be around 1 year. Figure 21 presents the causal pathway of inadequate breastfeeding p ractices to undernutrition. \"I stopped breastfeeding as I wanted my child to eat more food and wanted to be able to leave the house for work. \" (Mother, Kouk Sralao \"Stop breastfeeding when child is big enough or stop breastfeeding as they don't eat a lot when breastfeeding. Learn from each other, from each other's experiences. \" (Mother, Tmat Peuy ) \"60% continue breastfeeding to 2 years, mothers if ne ed to work.\" (Midwife, Choam Ksant HC) Figure 21 Causal pathway of inadequate breastfeeding practices to undernutrition 53 6.2.3. L. Inadequate child care practices Responsive feeding stimulates and develops a child's appetite .54 The RFS sh owed that 53.2% of children under 2 -years were helped to eat (Table 26). The RFS showed that 87.4% of these caregivers had a positive response when the child refused to eat , however through community enquiries the Link NCA found that the main practices wer e: to follow them whilst they play trying to feed them, and to give packaged snack s instead, a practice discussed by Key Informants and Health Workers as increasing. However there were also mothers who gave nutritious alternatives. Letting the child Playin g whilst feeding does not provide an adequate feeding environment and likely leads to less calorific intake , and packaged foods are not nutritiously adequate , both components of what is considered as good feeding practices . \"If child wont' eat, let them pl ay and give little by little. Or give snacks. \" (Mother, Svay) \"If won't eat, try to persuade them. Only one way won't cry when hungry - give them snacks. \" (Gran dmother, Tmat Peuy) The community perceive d frequent eating of packaged snacks as a negative practice; however caregivers continue d to do so. Snacks were seen to be non -nutritious, to cause children to eat less of their meals, and i n one community, to cause illness. A common discussion was how children cry until they are given money to purchase snac ks. Mothers gave them money. Table 22 Responsive feeding of children under the age of 2 -years n Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI Child helped to eat 254 53.2 43.8 62.5 Reported re sponsive feeding Nothing 16 11.9 4.5 19.2 Positive practice 118 87.4 79.2 95.6 Negative practice 1 0.7 -0.8 2.3 The mother being the main caregiver the majority of the time was identified as a positive deviant behaviour among poor mothers with healthy children. However, in the working pe riods of the year for many mothers, child ren were often left with secondary carers . A full discussion of the impact of secondary caregivers on care practices is detailed under Hypothesis E . Whe n mothers were col lecting water or firewood, some left their children at home alone . Additionally, children are often 'left to play' when mothers are busy at the household or doing causal labour. Given the lack of community cleanliness, it was a frequent observation that c hildren will pick food up from the floor to eat. \"Leave children with grandmother or neighbour when collecting water, or leave child if sleeping.\" (Mother, Kouk Sralao) \"Grandparent first choice to care for child, but if grandmother also needs to go to fi elds, then elder child.\" (Mother, Kouk Sralao) Poor care and lack of time was often perceived as a cause of undernutrition and poor health by mothers, fathers, key people and health workers , and was ranked as one of the main causes in three communities . In one community, a child not getting enough sleep was a common reason given for undernutrition by key participants and mothers. The main cause of poor care was seen to be high workload, and not enough time to properly care for chil dren. It was specified tha t high workload was 54 Bentley et al., Responsive Feeding and Child Undernutrition in Low - and Middle -Income Countries, JN, 2011 54 caused by the necessity to generate income. In one community, mothers felt that being busy was the main difference between healthy house holds and unhealthy households. High workload impacted on a number of practices identified as positi ve with the community : boiling of water, washing of hands, not watching the child, and not feeding packaged snacks, all increasing the risk of child illness and inadequate intake. Figure 22 presents the causal pathway of poor care practice to undernutritio n. \"Challenges in keeping a child healthy are family income, don't have time to care for ch ildren.\" (Mothers, Kouk Sralao) Figure 22 Causal pathway of poor care practices to child undernutrition 6.2.4. M. Poor quality diets of children under 5 -years Proper complementary feeding is defined as \"timely introduction of safe and nutritional foods in addition to breastfeeding\".55 Appropriate practices of complement ary feeding are crucial from 6 to 24 months for healthy growth and development, impacting on both weight and height gain.56 Mothers or grandmothers were the main decision makers when it came to food -related decisions. Table 23 presents dietary indicators for children 6 -23 months old. Compared to the DHS, more children were found to re ach the recommended MMD of 4 food groups, and less children were found to reach the recommended MMF . In comparison to National statistics of the D HS, MDD is similar at 47.6%, but MMF is much higher at 72.2%. Consumption of Vitamin -A rich foods was lower th an found in the DHS with plant based and animal -source vitamin -A rich foods consumed by less than 50% of children , but consumption of iron -rich foods was similar. A recent study in Cambodia found linkages between consumption of animal source foods and stun ting.57 55 A. Imdad, MY. Yakoob, & ZA.

In one community, it seemed that grandmothers were no t giving food until 8 to 10 - months. The majority first foods were 'borbor' a porridge made with rice and water, or rice mashed with soup water. Grandmothers in one community believed that a child could only eat rice and borbor until 1-year . At 1-year, the majority of mothers discussed changing the child's diet . Some gave pieces from the family food, including green -leaves , fish, meat, eggs, and rice. On further investigati on some mothers were only giving the soup water or a small piece of fish with rice. Increasing the quantity of food had different perceptions: more rice, more of everything, giving snacks and desert. [Under 1 -year]: \"Gave borbor or rice. With salt or soy sauce. Nothing else usually.\" (Mother, Sok Senchey) Figure 23 shows the most consumed food groups were cereals/grains, fish, seafood, crabs or snails, and condiments. Save the Children found that consumption of fish distinguished well -nourished from under -nourished children.58 Just under 50% of children had consumed meats, dark green leafy vegetables, and sugar. These patterns reflect the practices discussed in the community. Figure 2 3 shows similar numbers of children eating green leafy vegetables as other vegetables, however i n one community , when talking about feeding vegetables, mothers clarified they meant only green -leafy vegetables. They were only able to access other types of vegetables once a week or less because of the cost whereas green -leafy vegetables were gathered from the wild or homegardens. \"No money to buy vegetables and meat for children.\" (Mother, Svay) 58 The Manoff Group and Save the Children Cambodia, Understanding the Context for Promoting Nutrition -Enhancing Behaviours among Households with Severe Resource Constraints, NOURISH Project, 2015 56 Figure 23 Percentage of children 6 -23 months consuming specified food group in the last 24 -hours Figure 2 3 shows that consumption of sugary products is high at 49% . In one community, mothers sai d their children were e ating packaged snacks every day, including : crisps, ice -cream, biscuits and cakes , all high in sugar . At household level, 76% had consumed s ugary products in the last 24 hours, and 54% every day in the last 7 -days. Although mothers a ll identified packaged s nacks as bad for child ren, they discussed the problem with their child crying until they were given money to buy snacks. Mothers discussed how chil dren we re not hungry for their meals . This is an added expe nditure for households which already perceived income to be the main barrier to good diets . A number of mothers from poor households spoke of the pressure they felt to gi ve their child money for snacks. \"Children stand and cry if you don't buy them snacks.\" (Key People, Tmat Peuy) A small number of mothers had received advice on child's diets from their mothers or neighbo urs, but mostly advice was from Health Centre staff or no one at all . In some communities, advice on diets was only given when a child was identified as having maln utrition. Mothers who had received advice were advised to give borbor enriched with vegetables, bananas, eggs etc. The majority of mothers were doing this rarely, or not at all with income given as the main constraint. Foods which mothers were not able to afford were: fruits, vegetables other than green leaves, meat, fish, seafood, sterilised milk, and infant formula. In one group mothers discussed the child's preference was not for enriched borbor . As well as financial constraints, in one group of mothers they discussed not giving meat as they felt that then when they did not then have meat to give the child, they would not want to eat. Additionally, there was the belief that too much meat caused worms. \"There is no plan or programme to give advice to pare nts on child's diet. But when doing immunisations give advice to malnourished children.\" (Nurse, Kandukan Health Centre) [From 6 -12 months ] \"Only borbor and breastmilk. Plain borbor as child does not want to eat borbor with other ingredients, or I cannot b uy other ingredients. \" (Mother, Sok Senchey) \"Prevent parasitic worms by not letting them play with dirt, and don't let them eat much meat. \" (Mother , Svay) When there were food constraints, rice was often cook ed as porridge or everything was reduced. One community specified that v egetables were prioritised for purchasing , then fish and then meat. Many households would search for wild foods like frogs, crabs and green leaves. Some m others were 57 feeding the child until they were full before they ate themselve s. When there were financial constraints, chil dren were given rice with salt or soy sauce or whatever could be found in the wild. \"Main challenge is having enough money, when don't have enough money feed child what can find, like P rahok. Happens frequentl y. Some times also just rice with salt.\" (Grandmother, Sok Senchey) \"Find only small food, but give child until they are full to be healthy. Child eats first.\" (Mother, Tmat Peuy) Poor quality of diets was perceived as one of the main causes of malnutritio n by all communities, with the perception that children were being fed until they were full but not nutritious foods. Positive deviant behaviours identified were : feeding enriched borbor 1 - 3 times a week, and introducing family foods from 8 - 12 months. Figure 2 4 presents the causal pathway of poor quality diets to undernutrition. \"Give porridge with other ingredients but the child doesn't want to eat it. This causes undernutrition.\" (Mother, Svay) Figure 24 Causal pathway of p oor quality diets of children under 5 years to undernutrition 6.2.1. N. Poor nutritional status of Women of Child Bearing Age (WCBA) Poor maternal nutrition increases the risk of poor child growth in utreo as the child is completely dependent on t he mother's nu tritional stores with p oor pre -pregnancy stature and weight, and poor gestational nutrition have been shown to increase the risk of IUGR and child underweight.59 Poor maternal nutrition status may be due to inadequate food intake, ill ness or high energy exp enditure .60 Additionally, one study found that severely underweight children were more likely to have a mother who was undernourished.61 59 D Alasfoor, Determinants of Persistent Underweight among Children, Aged 6 -35 M onths, after Huge Economic Development and Improvements in Health Services in Oman, J Health Popul Nutr, 2007 60 U.

However, the DHS 2014 reported that 8.0% of women aged 15 -49 years in Preah Vihear/Stung Treng Province were b elow 145 cm, defined as small stature and at risk of obstructed labour.64 To overcome the effects of poor pre-pregnancy nutritional status, it is important to eat adequate amounts of food during pregnancy to ensure healthy gestational weight gain; however 4 7.0% of caregivers reported eating less or the same amount of food during their last pregnancy (Table 24 ). During community discussions, many mothers initially said they ate less during pregnancy, however once probed mothers explained at first they ate les s due to morning sickne ss but eventually ate more, this could mean this statistic is an over -estimation. The majority of mothers continued to work whilst pregnant, many until delivery. This was partly dependent on the season, in farming season they were mo re likely to have to work until delivery to support the household. Despite indicators showing sufficient diversity of household diets at this time of year , a common discussion in communities was food shortages. When there was low food availability or acces s, households would often eat rice with chilli and salt or what they could find in the wild , mainly frogs , crabs, fish, and green leaves. Some mothers reported this being a common occurrence and occurring during pregnancy . Although the majority of mothers knew recommended diets for pregnancy, there were financial barriers to these practices, 62 National Institute of Statistics, Directorate Gene ral for Health, and ICF International, Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2014, 2015 63 Ferro -Luzzi and James, Use of body mass index of adults in assessing individual and community nutritional status., Bull Word Health Organ, 1995 64 National Institute of Statistics, Directorate General for Health, and ICF International, Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2014, 2015 59 mainly meat and fruit. Action Against H unger's Resilience Survey 2016 found that women in the community talked about how they often did not eat until they were full, wi th men eating a larger portion of the household meal. During the NCA community discussions, mothers discussed how food was shared amongst the family, with o ne pot which everyone ate from, with no perception of gender differences. However, during times of f ood shortage, some mothers spoke of letting their children eat until they were full and then eating what was left. \"Try our best, when we have money. But if not, just eat rice salt and chili when wife pregnant.\" (Father, Tmat Peuy) \"If not enough food: m ake less. Sometimes can't eat meat so find crab or frog in forest, or collect wild food. Prioritise Prahok as keeps for long time.\"(Mother, Svay) \"When not enough food, most try to change the meal: rice to porridge, reduce everything. No priority within f amily, eat as family.\"(Mother, Tmat Peuy) Figure 25 Causal pathway of poor nutritional status of women of child bearing age to increased risk of maternal and child undernutrition 6.3. Relation with other sectors 6.3.1. FSL High maternal wor kload creates time constraints for caregivers, and increases the chance of secondary caregivers. Many communities linked poor care practices to the need to prioritise income generating activities and farming. The main barrier to feeding a nutritious diet w as low income . Poor diets are exasperated at times of household food insecurity. 6.3.2. Health Dietary advice is limited to Health Care workers, and as such presentation at the Health Centre during pregnancy, at delivery and following pregnancy is a crucial cont act point to receive this advice and support. Additionally, poor breastfeeding, care and diets can all lead to increased morbidity. 60 7. Water Access, Sanitation and Hygiene ( WASH ) 7.1. WASH Context Access to improved water supply and sanitation is low nationall y in rural areas. The National Strategy for Rural Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene 2011 -2025 reports that the estimated annual economic loss due to poor sanitation and hygiene is US$448 million. The objectives of the strategy are improved water supply, sanitation, hygiene behaviour change, enabling environment, and funding. Despite plenty of national data on improved water source and sanitation facility access, there is little information in the way of safe and hygienic sources and facilities. In the 2 015 the Provincial Department of Rural Development Workplan , there were no plans to build latrines in Choam Ksant district. There were plans to construct wells, ponds and repair handpumps in a selection of communes in the district as well as promotional an d educational activities for goo d hygiene and water management. Community -Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) was being implemented elsewhere in the Province, but not in Choam Ksant. 7.2. Findings for WASH Hypotheses 7.2.1. H. Open defecation and unhygienic environments The height of a child reflects their genetic predisposition as well as the childhood health and nutrition environment, in developing countries the latter becomes more important. One study found that households without latrines were significantly more likely t o have children under 6 -years who were wasted.65 In the RFS, only 17.0% of households were using a sanitation facility (Table 2 5). Of these 0.0% were observed as being safe and hygienic. Open defection and unhygienic environments were perceived by communiti es to be a main causes of undernutrition , with the perception that it spread viruses and bacteria causing illness. Compared to national statistics of 50.4%66, open defecation was much higher at 83.0% in the NCA context. The main discussion on why households did not have latrines was because of not having money to construct a latrine, with other priorities for saving. However, all communities saw having a latrine as a good thing, reasons ranged from: ease of use, comfortable, being able to flush the faeces, n o bad smells, privacy, and having soap. \"Don't have toilets as not enough money. Cannot save for a latrine, have to spend money on other things - education, health services, and weddings. \" (Father, Svay) \"Some save to buy latrines. One person had spent $700 and his still was not finished.\" (Key People, Tmat Peuy) 65 A Sharghi, et al., Evaluating risk factors for protein -energy malnutrition in children under the age of six years: a case - control stu dy from Iran, Int J Gen Med, 2011 66 National Institute of Statistics, Directorate General for Health, and ICF International, Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey 2014, 2015 61 Adults openly defecate away from the household whereas children defecate at the household. The majority of the time, mothers reported burying children's faeces in nearby forest, bush or fields, however the RFS shows only 50.4% of caregivers disposed of faeces in a safe way (Table 25) . This is much lower than in the KAP , which found 78.7% was safely disposed of.67 In one community, one group of mothers said that in the rainy season they did not alway s bury faeces, however the other group of mothers said that they did not bury in the dry season as the ground is too hard. Increasing open defecation has been shown to be strongly linked with decreasing average height of children globally, independent of w ealth, maternal literacy or access to infrastructure. There is an effect known as a \"spillover\", meaning open defecation introduces faecal germs to the environment affecting not just that person or household but everyone in the community, even those who ha ve latrines or come from wealthy households.68 69 An example of this arose in one community discussion about the practice of defecating in dry streams and ponds in the dry season; they were aware that when the stream or pond filled again this would contamina te the water where people drank from. \"Most go to the toilet in the forest. No latrines. Don't dig a hole in forest as far away from HH, and big. Also lazy to take equipment to dig the hole.\" (Key People, Tmat Peuy) \"Dig small hole to go to the toilet, b ury young children's in small hole. About 10m from the house.\" (Grandmother, Kouk Sralao) Table 25 Household and child s anitation indicators n Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI Provincial secondary data DHS 2014 Using Sanit ation facility 74 17.0 10.0 24.0 Use of safe & hygienic sanitation facilities 0 0.0 - - - Open Defecation 361 83.0 76.0 90.0 50.4a Caregivers practicing s afe disposal of faeces of children 0 -23months 128 50.4 41.2 59.6 50.0 a statistic for all rural areas Household members were mostly urinating on the household premises. Additionally, animals were freely roaming, and all mothers reported regularly finding animal faeces inside the household. This is collected, mostly once a day, and put in the yard or under a tree. Additionally, although household waste was collected once a day and burnt, communal spaces contained a lot of waste. Children commonly played on the ground, and in all communities this was one of th e main perceptions of poor care, and a cause of poor health and hygiene due to dirty foods on the ground and children getting visibly dirty. Recent research found that chicken faces in the environment has an effect on intestinal health and subsequent stunting.70 IFPRI found that household s keeping po ultry indoors ha d 67 Department of Rural Health Care, Ministry of Rural Development, National Sanita tion and Hygiene Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) Survey, 2010 68 D Spears, How much international variation in child height can sanitation explain? ation and children's health: evidence from 172 DHS surveys, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper Series, 2010 70 M.N.N.

Open defecation and unhygienic environments incr eased exposure to germs and hence more risk of disease , impacting on child nutrition . Use of unsafe water, presence of faeces in the yard and lack of sanitation facilities have been shown to be associated with increased diarrhoeal incidence.72 73 Figure 26 presents the causal pathway to child undernutrition. Figure 26 Causal pathway of open defecation and unhygienic environments to child undernutrition 7.2.2. I. Inconsistent access to clean water Having sufficient domestic water supply i s necessary for good hygiene and sanitation practices at the household. The RFS found that the average household meets the Sphere standards and Fanta standards for basic water needs per capita per day, however it did not meet the standards for drinking wat er or hygiene and sanitatio n purposes for either standard (Table 2 6). The RFS found that a large amount of daily water was used for 'other purposes' , mainly agricultural needs. 71 D. D. Headey and K.

There were seasonal access issues, with handpumps and wells becoming dry in the dry season , rainwat er was often used in the wet season . In one community water had to be purchased from Water Trucks , in this community groups of middle -wealth mothers rated their proportional expenditure on water as almost three times as much as poor -wealth mothers . In one community, households would dig wells near streams and ponds in the time of water shortages. Water shortages were a barrier to : growing homegardens, raising livestock, and drinking clean water . With purchase from Water Trucks, this w as also limiting water usage on hygiene. Collection of water t ook more time in the dry season . Household reported collecting water 4 -5 times a day. Time to collect water depended on the distance of the water source and type of water source. Those who were using a dug well report ed the l ongest water collection times. \"Every year have problems accessing water - pump has no water, sand blocks holes.\" (Mother, Tmat Peuy) \"Not difficult to access water. Most have hand pump access. No problems with water in handpumps in dry season. 1 0 families have handpumps, so can be far from some households. Sometimes 20 families have 1 handpump. \" (Key people, Svay) \"Many family members collect water. Go 4 -5 times a day. Each time collect 2 buckets. Each time takes 10-20 minutes, depends on dista nce. Sometimes have to queue for 10 minutes. Takes longer in dry season.\" (Mother, Svay) There is evidence to show that households using improved water sources have children with better growth.74 The main source of water in 92.7 % of households was groundwat er, 11.7% used surface water, 4.8% used sealed bottled water , 0.5% used roof rainwater an d 0.2% Water Trucks . In the rainy season, groundwater sources reduced to 48% and 48% used mainly roof rainwater. The remaining 5% were using surface water. Although ma ny use improved water sources at the village, when in the field s many use surface water. Figure 27 shows that 48.5 % of household's main water sources during the dry season had a moderate to severe risk of contamination. In one group they discussed how wate r in Wells becomes dirty because each household puts their own bucket in to the well to collect the water. Additionally, water source s are often used for animals and agriculture too. Maintenance of water sources was predominantly through raising community funds. In some communities, the household w here the water source was situat ed was in charge of maintenance . In the rainy season the risk will increase of contaminants being washed in to unprotected or damaged water sources . \"Water becomes unclean because p ump not clean properly, or because people shower at the pump. Animals drink water at pump.\" (Mother, Tmat Peuy) 74 SA Esrey et al., Drinking water source, diarrheal morbidity, and child growth in villages with both traditional and improved water supplies in rural Lesotho, southern Africa., Am J Public Health , 1988 64 \"Use handpumps all year. Main problem is when handpumps not working, another handpump is far away. Only happens sometimes. Members who use handp ump collect money to fix handpumps.\" (Mother, Svay) Figure 27 Risk of contamination of main water source of 436 households in the dry season Table 27 shows that 46.9% of households were at severe risk of water contamination betwe en collection, transport ation and use at the household . Water was often collected and transport ed in old paint pots without lids, although some communities used purchased buckets with lids for transportation and storage . Household storage was predominantly in large clay pots or plastic buckets. Use of plastic buckets made water being covered during transportation and at the household more likely. If the household had the resources they would store water for different purposes in different plac es. Table 27 Average Water Management Score and proportion of households in each category of risk n Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI Water Management Score (mean (SE)) 436 4.3 (0.2) 3.9 4.7 Mild risk (0 -1) 17 4.1 0.8 7.4 Modera te risk (2 -4) 203 46.7 35.6 57.8 Severe risk (5 -7) 194 46.9 34.6 59.1 Use of unclean water for drinking has been shown to increase childhood illness, in particular diarrhoea. One study found that improved water quality interventions had a greater imp act on reducing diarrhoea than interventions aimed at improving sanitation, hygiene education or provision of soap.75 The NCA identified consistent treatment of drinking water as a positive deviant behaviour. Figure 28 presents the methods of treating water , with 25% reporting not treating water , similar to the National Statistic of 19.2%.76 However, d uring community enquiries, the majority of each group reported drinking water without any treatment , either \"usually\" or \"sometimes\" . Drinking from ponds and st reams increased when away from the household . Barriers to treating water were: high workload and time constraints, and not having a water filter. Therefore, despite the RFS findings, it 75 H Waddington, and S. Birte, Effectiveness and susta inability of water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions in combating diarrhoea, J Dev Effect, 2009 76 National Institute of Statistics, Cambodia Socio -Economic Survey 2014, 2015 65 can be inferred that this method of treatment is not consistently appl ied. The National WASH KAP survey found similar results, with 83.2% treating water, but only 53.3% doing this always.77 \"Drink water directly. Give to children directly. Stream, pond, well.\" (Fathers, Tmat Peuy) \"Some drink water directly from hand pump, so me use filters. No one boils water. CWS gave filters, but some people don't use them still. But doesn't always cause problems like diarrhoea.\"(Key People, Svay) Figure 28 Methods used for treatment of water before drinking In th e majority of groups, communities were aware that drinking unclean water was not good for health and d rinking unclean water was perceived as a main cause of undernutrition. Some groups mentioned it causing diarrhoea and illness , and others that it caused t heir children not to grow properly. One group mentioned that water sources are not clean and they do not have filters. Perception of clean water was often no visible dirt in the water, a common discussion was about 'carbon' in the water as a white powder. In some groups there was discussion on cont amination of water from animals. \"Use water direct from handpump. Boil if seen animal faeces near the pump.\" (Mother, Svay) 77 Department of Rural Health Care, Ministry of Rural Development, National Sa nitation and Hygiene Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) Survey, 2010 66 Figure 29 Causal pathway of inconsistent acces s to clean water to child undernutrition 7.2.3. J. Poor hygiene practices Leading causes of diarrhoea have been found to be poor household sanitation and caretaker hygiene. Gastrointestinal infections and parasites can be caused by unhygienic food and water , and faecal -oral transmission . These situations are at high risk of arising in the NCA context, with human and animal faeces in the environment , limited handwashing af ter defecating and cleaning infants' faece s, and before food preparation .78 Poor hygiene was perceived to be a main cause of undernutrition by all communities . There is evidence to show that when soap and water are available to households, handwashing can reduce childhood diarrhoea.79 80 Use of soap was identified as a positi ve deviant behaviour. S oap was reported in 94.5% of households, with 90.3% reporting use today or yesterday (Table 28) . However, during the community enquiries this behaviour was not reflected. The majority of people would only sometimes use soap, even if it is present at the ho usehold, or would \"usually\" wash hands with just water. This behaviour was particularly prominent when working away from the household . Barriers to soap use were normally related to convenience, for example not having a latrine with a hand washing station or not having the time. \"90% of men use only water to wash hands. When openly defecating, 90% of men don't wash hands.\" (Fathers, Kouk Sralao) \"When go to the forest, don't have soap. At home, sometimes do sometimes don't. Sometimes they are already clea n, or sometimes in a hurry.\" (Fathers, Svay) In communities, t he most frequently reported time for washing hands was \"before eating\". The RFS found that this was the most common time, however only 24.3% of caregivers reported washing their 78 M Sheth, and R Dwivedi, Complementary foods associated diarrhoea, Indian J Pediatr, 2006 79 V Curtis and S Cairncross, Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review, The Lancet infectious diseases, 2003 80 RI Ejemot -Nwadiaro et al., Hand washing for preventing diarrhoea, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, 2008 67 hands before eat ing today or yesterday (Table 28 ). Compared to National Statistics of 78.4%, this is dramatically lower , however this result was questioned at the time of publication of the KAP survey . One group of mothers discussed only washing hands when they were visib ly dir ty, but others seemed to have an understanding of invisible contaminants . Washing hands after defecating is also lower at 19.5% compared to national levels of 29.8% .81. The RFS also found 80.5% (n=331, 95%CI: 72.1; 88.9) of caregivers said they washed their hands at a non -critical time, this was clarified as when washing dishes, clothes, and when bathing .

Mothers and grandmothers often reported washing their children more than 3 times a day due to them getting dirty fr om playing on the ground and the dusty environment. Some groups o f mothers discussed how difficult it was to keep their children clean. Of children aged under five years observed during the RFS, 24.5% were perceived to be dirty and only 10.3% as clean. Basic food hygiene was investigated, with all mothers reporting storing food with a cover away from animals. However, the RFS found that only 15.1% of caregivers washed before preparation of food. 81 Department of Rural Health Care, Ministry of Rural Development, Nationa l Sanitation and Hygiene Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) Survey, 2010 82 A.

Relation with other sectors 7.3.1.1. Health Disease is the pathway by which poor water, sanitation and hygiene lead to undernutrition. There is poor access to health advice of prevention of water -related diseases. 7.3.1.2. FSL The main reason for open defecation was not having access to sanitation facilities, due to poor income. When caregivers were aware of good practices, the main r eason given for not practicing these was high workload, by both mothers and fathers. 8. Knowle dge 8.1. Findings for Knowledge Hypotheses 8.1.1. R. Poor Knowledge attainment Communities rated poor knowledge highly as a cause of malnutrition in their communities and during community discussions it was clear that some form of education was seen as a priority fo r children. There is strong evidence showing the link between caregiver's education and child nutrition and health. In one large study, women's education was ranked at the top priority for child malnutrition reduction .83 Education is thought to work through a cyclical link, with a relationship with measures of socioeconomic status. Studies which have controlled for wealth show varying results of the impact of education on child 83 LC Smith and LJ Haddad, Explaining child malnu trition in developing countries, IFRPI ng-countries -0 69 for how maternal education affects nutri tional status is through maternal knowledge or ability to attain knowledge. One study suggested knowledge of nutrition may have more of an impact on nutritional status of the child than on formal education of the mother.86 87However, as Bhutta et al acknowle dge, knowledge can only do so much to improve practices if the household do not have resources, or specifically sufficient foods .88 The RFS shows that 33.1% of caregivers had no education, and 33.8% had not completed primary but had some primary education s howing that education levels were generally very low in the communities (Table 29 ). Caregivers with no education is higher than the national level of women with no education, at 12.8% . Table 29 Education levels of Caregivers n Proportion (%) Lower 95% CI Upper 95% CI Provincial secondary data DHS 2014 Education levels 435 None 33.1 24.9 41.3 23.7 Some primary 38.4 33.0 43.8 45.1 Completed primary 12.9 8.6 17.2 7.1 Some secondary 12.6 6.6 18.7 19.7 Completed secondary 2.8 0.7 4.9 2.2 Higher education 0.2 -0.2 0.7 2.1 Sources of knowledge were mainly from the Health Centre staff during presentation for illness or pregnancy care. There were limited community outreach activities for education. There was a discussion wi th one Health Post member of staff about those who are less educated not attending the community education and awareness sessions. Knowledge of undernutrition was not always strong in communities, however knowledge of health and hygiene was better. The maj ority of groups were knowledgeable about what a good diet was for a child, however their knowledge of age -appropriate feeding was poor. Despite adequate knowledge levels around hygiene and health, many good practices were not being frequently done with lac k of resources and time given as the reason. In the majority of communities, where discussions were disaggregated in to wealth of households, better knowledge and ability to cooperate were noticed in the middle -wealth households. Schools seem to be includ ing health and hygiene education in the curriculum. In one community they discussed how children have better handwashing practices than adults through improved knowledge and awareness from school , however children often left school to work on the fields or help at the family home from 12 -15 years. In some groups there was the observation that poor child growth leads to school being more difficult, and the child being less clever. \"Children wash hands as taught at school\" (Mother, Svay village, Rumdaoh Sra e) 84F Burchi, Child nutrition in Mozambique in 2003: the role of mother's schooling and nutrition knowledge, Economics & Human Biology, 2010 85 V Vella et al, Determinants of nutritional status in south -west Uganda, j Trop Pediatr, 1995 86 P Glewwe and J Hanan Jacoby, Student achievement and schooling choice in low -income countries: Evidence from Ghana, Journal of Human Resources , 1994 87 LY Appoh, and K Sturla, Maternal nutritional knowledge and child nutritional status in the Volta region of Gh ana, Matern Child Nutr, 2005 88 Bhutta et al., What works? Interventions for maternal and child undernutrition and survival, Lancet, 2008 70 Figure 31 Causal pathway of poor knowledge attainment to child undernutrition 8.1.2. S. Poor a wareness of undernutrition The National Nutrition Programme in Cambodia is implemented through the Referral Hospitals and Health Centres, in practice they provide supplements and therapeutic feeding for acute malnutrition, and education on optimal nut rition for children. However, according to the National Nutrition Strategy, the capacity of health staff for inter -personal communication skill s and counselling is low. Children identified as having SAM are referred to the Provincial Referral H ospital, from Choam Ksant district this is a minimum of 1.5 hours away and a maximum of 4 hours away. However, there were repor ts that mothers sometimes refuse d to go due to the cost of the transport and health care , and lack of awareness of the consequences and impact of their child having malnutrition . Despite UNICEF covering the costs of inpatient treatment for SAM in Cambodia if the Government Health Equ ity Fund was not applicable , there appeared to be low awareness of this process at Health Centres and at the Provincial Hospital itself. Despite there being more community awareness and discussion of stunting as a form of malnutrition, children are monito red routinely by only their weight. In terms of identifying SAM cases in the community, WAZ is used , they are then referred to Health facilities where they have length/height measuring equipment. On trying to identify positive and negative deviants based o n their WAZ in the community during the NCA, it was found that village chiefs, VHSGs and Health Centre staff were unable to identify the children who were currently underweight, or who they perceived to be undernourished following a visual description. Even when there seemed to be knowledge on causes of undernutrition in groups of the community, awareness of undernutrition was often low in terms of visually identifying cases and realising they needed medical attention. In one community, they had heard of u ndernutrition but the community were not able to determine undernutrition fr om other child illness es. Mothers knew their child ha d undernutrition when they were measured, this was also the way the VHSG in this community reported being about to tell if a ch ild ha d undernutrition. In one community, one group of mothers and the fathers had never heard of 'undernutrition'. But they had noticed that all children were not 71 growing equally, with a focus on linear growth. In the majority of communities, w hen discuss ing poor child growth , the focu s was on stunting. However, a lthough all groups were aware that children were not growing tall they were not sure why. On a number of occasions parents stated that their child was eating a lot, they weren' t sick , but they wer e not growing properly. In two communities, a number of groups thought that b eing short was due to genetics due to observing sma ll parents with small children. This was also a perception of stunting by nutrition staff at a local NGO. Other reasons given by NGOs were early marriage and not knowing how to care for a child during pregnancy. It was not possible to test this risk factor within the means of the Link NCA. However, there is findings to suggest that this may be a risk factor for undernutrition, sup ported by Technical Stakeholders and as such a focused study is recommended. Figure 32 outlines the hypothesised pathway to undernutrition. Figure 32 Causal pathway of poor awareness of malnutrition to child undernutrition 9. Seasonality, historical trends and shocks 9.1. Seasonality and medium term trends of undernutrition and risk factors Seasonality has been discussed under each hypotheses w here relevant. Seasonal calendars for each community visited in the qualitative enquiry can b e found in Annex G. Figure 33 presents the cases of acute malnutrition identified and treated by the Provincial Health Department in 2015. This data is not given much weight in the ratings as the data was not perceived to be reliable or representative of all cases of acute malnutrition in Choam Ksant due to poor identification and referral. This data presents those cases that were identified and treated only. 72 Figure 33 Acute malnutrition case load of the Provincial Health Departm ent for 2015 From this data, it seems that there are more cases in February, May - July and September. There is an initial peak in February, hypothesised causal risk factors to explain these trends are: Cassava planting and harvest occurs in January and February ; Casual labour was more common in December to March ; Secondary carers were more common from and November to February; From November to January, the weather changes - though to be a cause of child illness. There is a sharp decline in SAM from Jun e to August, this may better reflect access to healthcare then the prevalence of malnutrition as this data is based on treatment only. During this time families are busy working on their rice crops. It is likely that there is more malnutrition from May thr ough to September. Hypothesised causal risk factors to explain these trends are: In April, t he rainy season begins, likely to spread the areas with faecal contamination ; From April to May , all communities reported child illness when the \"weather changes\" : ARI, fever and diarrhoea. Malaria and Dengue w ere later in July to September; Drinking of unclean water increased from May to September during time in the field; Women were busy from May to September , associated with a number of risky care p ractices; Secon dary carers were more common from May to September ; Most income is generated in December to February with sale of crops, most causal labour is also in this period. Incomes were mainly less for the rest of the year; Less availability of fish and ot her wild foods from May to June; Food shortages reported pre -harvest in August to September ; and, Increased food prices f rom Apri l to June. 73 9.2. Historical trends of risk factors and undernutrition Historical timelines were generated through discussion with village el ders and community members who had been in the village for a long time. The historical timelines can be found for each community visited in the qualitative enquiry in Annex H . The risk factor s with a historical trend were: Eating of packaged snacks was inc reasing and affecting quality of children's diets; Women working away from home was seen to be increasing with more opportunities for work, meaning mothers were spending more time away from their children; Natural resources were decreasing, impacting on i ncome and food availability ; Extreme temperatures were seen to be increasing; Animal disease is seen to have increased in frequency in recent years; Incomes were seen to be decreasing due to poor crops and depleting natural resources; Prices of rice and C assava were seen to be decreasing; Borrowing of money and loans was seen to be increasing; Exclusive breastfeeding and timely initiation have improved in Cambodia and the NCA context; Delivery at Health facilities had increased, meaning more exposure at bi rth to skilled health advice; Children being vaccinated had increased; Use of traditional medicine and traditional healers is seen to have decreased with many more seeking treatment at health centres; Roads are still poor in some areas, but they have impr oved and many reported building of roads in the last 5 -years 9.3. Recent shocks Recent shocks included droughts , poor rains and less frequently, floods . This is difficult to summarise as one set of shocks as they differed across the four communities . They are d etailed in the Historical timelines for each village in Annex H. 10. Positive deviant behaviours 10.1. Positive deviant c ase studies 10.1.1. Case study 1 The mother was 29 years old and her daughter was 23 months old. She displayed positive practices during pregnancy, atte nding the Health Centre each month and adjusting her diet to eat more and diverse foods. She had to work until 9 -months gestation as it was the harvest season. She delivered her baby at the Health Centre, and initiated breastfeeding as first foods. She exc lusively breastfeed, and introduced plain borbor at 6-months. Once a week she gave enriched borbor . From 1 year, she gave porridge, rice, and family foods. She finds vegetables at home, and her husband finds fish and 74 frogs in the wild. When the household e xperience s food shortages, the children eat first. They also reduce the amount of meat and vegetables and have more rice. She had a water filter and uses this to treatment drinking water. She washes her hands with clothes detergent before eating, after defecating, and when hands are dirty. She washes the child's hands before eating. She disposes of her daughters faeces in a small hole in the backyard. Her daughter has rarely been sick. She has financial barriers to accessing healthcare and has no transporta tion. When he r husband is at home he cares for the ch ildren, and sometimes cooks when she has work . This season she is not busy, but in the farming season she is very busy. She takes her daughter to the field and sets up a hammock for her. She perceived he r main issues in raising her children to be not having much money so can't buy things for the children like other families. 10.1.2. Case study 2 The mother was 26 years old, and the child was 10 months. During pregnancy she ate a healthy diet and increased her fo od intake. She went to the Health Centre three times during pregnancy, and delivered her son there. She worked up until delivery as the elders told her that if she did her delivery would be easy. She exclusively breastfed until 7 months, when she introduce d enriched borbor . She continued to give this three times a week, with plain borbor or rice the rest of the time. From 9 months she began to give fish and vegetables from the family foods. If her son refuses to eat, she will give him breastmilk. When there is a shortage of food in the household they reduce the amount the children eat. She boils the water from the clay storage pot before he drinks, or gives him bottled drinking water. She washes her hands before eating, and when taking a shower. She always h as soap, and uses this or ash. She washes her son's hands before eating, sometimes with soap. She disposes of his faeces in a hole, she also defecates in the backyard in a hole. Her son has only been ill with a cold and infrequent diarrhoea. She does not h ave any challenges getting to the Health Centre as she has a moto, but s ometimes she has to borrow money to pay for the medicine. She receives help with childcare f rom neighbours and her husband. When she gets work or goes to the forest, the husband stays home with the chil dren and cooks and feeds them. The main problem she has with raising her children is money. But also because she has lots to do at home, and her husband is always in the field. 10.1.3. Case study 3 The mother was 25 years and the child was 9 mont hs. During pregnancy she went to the Health Centre every month, and once attended a Mother Support Group . She changed her diet , eating more fruit and more bananas, and increased her intake. She worked up until delivery, but with decreased workload. She wen t in to labou r early and had to have surgery, delivered at the Hospital. She gave infant formula f or the first 3 months until she started to express breastmilk. She used a baby bottle and cleaned the bottle every time she used it with hot water. After 3 m onths she gave only breastmilk until 6 -months when she gave borbor. The Nurse came to the village for a meeting and gave her advice on what to feed her baby. She now gives her son borbor , UHT milk snacks and rice with family foods such as fish, soup, somet imes beef and a lot of eggs. Her household lacks food almost every day, but it is worse in the dry season. She does labour work in this time and when she works she takes the baby with her. Sometimes she will get food from the shop but pay for it later, or sometimes they will eat more rice. She gives the baby more rice as a priority. She will always boil water b efore giving it to her son. Her grandmother supports he r in caring for the child . She washes her hands before eating and before feeding her child, mo stly with soap. She cleans the child's hands when they are dirty and gives him lots of baths. She uses a disposable nappy for the child, and throws it far from the house. The adults in the household defecate in the open field near the house. He has only be en ill with a high temperate since being born, and she took him to the HC for medicine. She does not have any challenges in going to the Health Centre as she has a moto. The main problem she thinks they are 75 facing in raising their child is not having enoug h money. She tries to overcome this by working and earning money. 10.1.4. Case study 4 The Mother was 22 years old and her daughter was 13 month old. During pregnancy, she went to the Health Centre 4 -5 times and also asked her mother for advice. She changed her d iet, eating more and eating fish and vegetables. At 5 months she stopped doing heavy work. She delivere d her baby at the health centre, and initiated breastfeeding within 30 minutes of delivery. She exclusively breastfed until 6 -months when she gave borbor with salt. She also gave rice, snacks and UHT milk cartons. From 7-8 months she gave the same foods as the family: rice, meat, vegetables, snacks. When the household experience food shortages she borrows rice from other people and buys less meat and veget ables. She gives her daughter water directly from the handpump as she sees that it is clean. She washes her hands with soap b efore eating and after holding something dirty. She washes the child's hands before she holds a snack, and always uses soap. Her da ughter defecates in a potty, she buries this in a hole. Herself, she defecates in the bushes far away and also always digs a hole to bury it. Her daughter has only been sick tw ice with a respiratory disease, s he took her to the health centre and she then g ot better. She does not f ind it difficult to go to the Health Centre and has no problems with the healthcare costs.She has help caring for her child from the grandmother, grandfather and uncle. She is always at home with her child in the dry season, in the wet season she may go to the field and leave her baby with the grandparents. She feels her main issue she is facing in raising her child is when she is sick, and not having enough money to buy food for her baby. This happens frequently. She copes by doing causal labour and leaving the baby with the grandmother. 10.2. Negative deviant case studies 10.2.1. Case study 1 The mother was 32 years old and her child was 4 years and 1 month (the child was malnourished when she was under 2 years, and was still ). During pregnancy, the mother visited the Health Centre 4 - 5 times, she changed her diet eating a lot and more vegetables and fruit. She stopped doing heavy work at 8 months . She delivered her baby at home as it was a quick birth, assisted by the TBA. She then went to the He alth Centre. She exclusively breastfed until 5 \u00bd months, when she gave powdered rice porridge as the baby cried a lot. She had got advice on this from other mothers. Until 2 -years her daughter ate dried fish, meat, vegetables and rice. The mother feeds the child herself, and if the child does not want to eat she will stop feeding her. Sometimes the children ask for money for packaged foods and she will give them money. When the household experience food shortages she gives the same amount of food to the chi ld and the parents eat less. She boils or filters water before drinking, however when they are in the field they drink from streams and ponds. She washes her hands before eating, but does not use soap. The washes the child's hands before eating . The daught er's faeces is disposed of by throwing it in the rice field next to the house. At 4-5 months her daughter started to get sick and has always been sick a lot. She has fever, and white spots on her tongue. Her daughter used to have diarrhoea almost every day when she was 1 -3 years old. When this was happening, she was going to the health centre daily. She has support from the grandmother, the grandmother will watch the child when the mother goes to the rice field or does labour work. She felt that her main issues in raising her chi ld were that she is sick a lot and she has to generate or borrow money to pay the costs. 76 10.2.2. Case study 2 The mother was 35 years old, and h er child was 3 years and 10 months (s he was malnourished when she was under 2 years and was st ill). During pregnancy she went to the Health Centre 4 times. She did not change her diet, but ate more. She worked in the fields until delivery and delivered at the Health Centre. She gave breastmilk immediately and exclusively breastfed until 6 -months wh e she gave borbor . Under 2 -years of age she gave rice, fish, eggs and packaged cakes. She g ives meat a few times a month. When the household experience food shortages they reduce the amount they eat. She reported boiling the water for drinking, however an observation in the interview was the daughter helping herself to water from the storage bucket, and this water had not been treated. She washes her hands after chopping wood, or before eating, sometimes with soap. She washes her child's hands when they are dirty. She disposes of her daughters faeces by burying it on the other side of the fence. The adults defecate in the forest. Her daughter has had diarrhoea a few times, she took her to the Health C entre. She has some challenges in going to the Health Cen tre as she does not have a moto. It takes 2 -3 hours to walk with the small child. Sometimes she will borrow transport. She does not have any support caring for her child. On rare occasions, the grandma will look after the child if she must go to work or if she needs to go to collect wood. In the farming season she takes the children to the field and they sleep there. They stay in a small house, and the children are left there behind a fence for 2 -3 hours at a time if sleeping, and 1 hour if sleeping. She so metimes argues with her husband when he has been drinking alcohol, as he does not do anything. There is never any violence. She feels her main issue with raising her children is that she has no money, no jobs to do, and no tractor so they have to rent farm ing equipment. 10.2.3. Case study 3 The mother was 33 years and her daug hter was 2 years and 10 months old. During pregnancy, she went to the Health Centre 6 -7 times, she ate more during pregnancy. She worked up until delivery. She delivered at the Health Centre , and exclusively breastfed until 6 -7 moths when she gave borbor with salt. At 7 months she gave rice with water and soy sauce. Now she gives her daughter family foods . Her household have enough food for all months of the year. She boils water for her daught er to drink. She washes her hands with soap when she gets home from work and before eating. She washes the child's hands before eating with soap. However, during the interview both hers and her daughter's hands and nails were very dirty. She disposes of he r daughter's faeces by burying it near the household. She defecates in a hole far from the house. Her daughter has been sick a lot, mainly with respiratory disease, cold and cough. She takes her to the Health Centre , or the Referral H ospital. She also some times has diarrhoea, when she does she will give tablets which s he has bought from a Private Clinic. She believes diarrhoea i s caused by eating the wrong type of food, such as bottled orange juice and snacks or mango. She does not have any idea how to prev ent diarrhoea. She ha s challenges in going to the Health Centre as she does not have money for transport. She will overcome this challenge by asking the moto -taxi if she can pay later. She is on her own most of the time as her husband works away and comes home every 2 weeks. When he is home he also helps to care for the child. Her normal daily schedule is to go to work as a labourer, she brings her daughter with her. She did not think that she had any problems in raising her child. 10.3. Summary of positive and negative behaviours and practices On conducting in -depth interviews with negative and positive deviant mothers, the main difference noticed was that the negative deviant mothers had children who were sick a lot. Positive practices and behaviours were ident ified as: 77 Giving enriched borbor 1 - 3 times a week from 6 -12 months ; Giving 'family foods' from 8 -12 months ; Consistent treatment of drinking water; The mother being the primary caregiver for the majority of the time ; Having support from a husband in cari ng for the child ; The child not being sick very often ; and, Use of soap for washing hands . 11. Final rating exercise 11.1. Rating exercise with the communities At the end of the community enquiries in each village, participants were invited to discuss the results. Presented to them were the most relevant hypotheses to their community. They were then asked to pick those which they thought were most important, and to give each a rating from 1 (minor contributor to undernutrition) to 5 (major contributor to undernutrit ion) The below summarises the average rating of both groups of mothers and the group of fathers in each community of the qualitative enquiries.

The rating presented here is an average of these risk factors. 83 12. Local Causal Model 84 Section III: Recommendations 1. General programme and policy recommendations Prior to implementation of the programme, it is recom mended to spend time to ensure community buy-in. Some communities were less inclined to participate in the NCA survey, and there were similar reports from Health staff for community awareness activities. Additionally, an overarching recommendation is the c onsideration of all caregivers (mothers, fathers, grandmothers, possibly adolescent siblings) for activities to ensure secondary caregivers are improving practices and fathers are support wives in good practices. In some communities, knowledge is not the i ssue but there are barriers to behaviour change, therefore SBCC approaches should be carefully designed to provide optimal behaviour change, and progress of positive behaviours should be monitored with strategies adapted and improved with operational learn ing and observations. Additionally, education levels are poor in many households and as such interactive and demonstrative SBCC tools should be used to deliver educational messages. Many risk factors showed seasonality - with worse practices during the fa rming season when adults tended to be away from the household. Many behaviours that are often promoted such as hand washing with soap, treatment of water, using latrines etc are not possible in the field or forest setting. This should be considered, with p ossible options for how to enable these practices when adults are working away from home as this constitutes a large proportion of the year. On this note, timing and location of activities should be carefully thought about to ensure activities have maximum participation. It is likely that in the farming season, the best location for any group meetings or educational sessions would be in the fields. Migration season should also be factored in to timings. The below presents recommendations from the analyst for programme activ ities and the risk factors addressed through these activities. Major risk factors are in bold and underlined, important risk factors are in bold, and minor risk factors are in normal text type. Recommendation Risk factors addressed Beneficiary Support the PDRD to begin CLTS in Choam Ksant (PDRD) Open defecation and unhygienic environments Community Micro financing or social enterprise for latrine construction (iDE) Open defecation and unhygienic environments Community Facilitation of sanitation and hygiene committees, to include clearing communities of rubbish from communal areas, and promotion of construction of latrines and hand -washing points Open defecation and unhygienic environments High prevalence of disease: diarrhoea, environmental enteropathy and parasitic worms Community Establish/promote baby -friendly play areas, protected from animals and free of faeces, foods and other contaminants on the ground High prevalence of disease: diarrhoea, environmental enteropathy and parasitic worms Caregiver and child Promote purchase of water filters High prevalence of disease: diarrhoea, Caregiver and 85 (iDE) environmental enteropathy and parasitic worms child SBCC and education to include: prevention of diarrhoea, EE, worms; hand -washing practices, bacteria and germs, transmission routes of faecal bacteria, safe disposal of child and animal faeces, etc (gender mainstream) High prevalence of disease: diarrhoea, environmental enteropathy and parasitic worms Poor knowledge attainment Household Support the PHD to strengthen links between the Health Centres and communities (PHD) High prevalence of disease Exposure to skilled health advice Community VSLA or similar between caregivers for the use of accessing Healthcare only High prevalence of disease Exposure t o skilled health advice Caregiver and child Support IGAs and social enterprises closer to home for primary caregivers; Low incomes and limited livelihoods Maternal employment and seasonal migration Caregiver and child Establish VSL A to reduce loans take n from Banks; Low incomes and limited livelihoods Poor resilience Household Community rice banks Poor resilience Community Vocational skills training; Low incomes and limited livelihoods Community Farmer training for men and women - resilient farming techniques, diversify crops, irrigation Poor resilience Agricultural dependence and poor crop diversity Low income and limited livelihoods Food security Household Support for farmers to sell their agricultural products at higher prices (?Collaboration) Poor market links and poor infrastructure Community Support VHSGs to establish Mother Support Groups, to focus on SBCC for care practices, breastfeeding support, psychosocial support, IYCF and prevention of illness Care practices Poor quality diets of chil dren under 5 - years Poor nutritional status of women of child bearing age Gender issues and maternal wellbeing Poor knowledge attainment Caregiver and child Handwashing stations made from locally available resources (e.g. tippy -taps) Hygiene practices Hous ehold Promotion of soap use for bathing to increase soap contact points Hygiene practices Caregiver and child Support community to create maintenance groups for water sources Inconsistent access to clean water Community SBCC for safe water collection, transport, and storage Inconsistent access to clean water Poor knowledge attainment Household Micro gardens, including water Food insecurity Household 86 efficient methods, use of waste water for plants, and solutions for keeping animals out; Construction of fish farms (Cash - for-work?)

Poor nutritional status of women of child bearing age Caregiver and child 87 Now thought to be genetics, with no solution with messages on importance of eating more when pregnant Poor knowledge attainment 2. Next steps In follow up to the results of the NCA, it is recommended that maternal health is investigated further. It has not been clarified what is causing such a high number of caregivers to be at risk of depression, but given the impact on care practices of young children and the mother's own nutritional status this is an important risk factor to understand more about. It is recommended that there is a focused study, possibly in collaboration with the Provincial Departm ent of Women's Affairs or TPO, a local NGO working in mental health, to assess the main risk factors for risk of depression. Maternal Health does not come under Action Against Hunger's expertise, and as such would need to be worked on with a collaborating partner. During the months of April and May, a Participatory Community Action Planning (PCAP) will be conducted by the Re silience and Nutrit ion Programme Managers with two Community Facilitators, trained by the Resilience Advisor for Action Against Hunger International. The Participatory Community Action Planning (PCAP) will include: Preliminary action plan prepared Composition and training of the team Analysis of the Link NCA and Resilience Analysis Reports Select communities and representatives Planning of field activities Pilot test of the methodology Risk factors: self -identification and validation by communities Risk factors: village level contextualisation Risk Factors: vulnerability and capacity Visioning Community Action Planning and leaning needs Learning visits Review and finalisation of Community Action Plans 88 Final Conclusions The Link NCA results provide a number of actionable risk factors for undernutrition in Choam Ksant. A complex situation exists, with minimal resources to enable behavi our change despite good knowledge in some communities. With minimal commune funding and scattered coverage of local NGOs, there is a need for collaboration and coordination of activities for maximum coverage and impact. Two risk factors were highlighted as major: open defecation and unhygienic environments, and the closely related child illnesses (diarrhoea, environmental enteropathy and worms, as well as fever and ARI). Given these results, the recommendation is a Nutrition programme with a strong WASH - com ponent or collaboration with a WASH partner. Recently a Nutrition -WASH sub -working Group has been established at National level with key actors in both sectors. This shows there is already National momentum for the integration of Nutrition and WASH program ming. UNICEF have recently completed a Theory of Change for Nutrition and WASH which will be informative to the programme design. NOURISH is a current large scale Nutrition -WASH programme being implemented in other areas of Cambodia, any lessons learnt thr ough their progress so far would be useful to strengthen the implementation plans for Action Against Hunger. The Nutrition component should focus on IYCF and maternal diets, with promotion of age -appropriate feeding for children, including the amount of f ood given, and increased food intake during pregnant. The WASH component should focus on reducing open defecation, safe disposal of faeces, cleaning up environments, and improved handwashing practices at critical times. Additionally, a number of risk fact ors were rated as important under food security and livelihoods (FSL). These were low incomes and limited livelihoods, poor market access and infrastructure, poor resilience and household food insecurity. As such it is also recommended that the programme c ontain a FSL component to improve the capacity and ability of households to generate sustainable and reliable incomes to improve household wealth, which impacts on a number of risk factors, as well as providing alternative coping mechanisms that taking loa ns or selling assets, and reduces issues with food access at the household and subsequently improved child and household nutritional status. Actionable recommendations are made for programme strategy and specific activities to input to the following respon se analysis and programme design. 89 Annex Annex A.

High risk for m osquito -borne disease in children under 5 years Mosquito -borne diseases such as malaria and dengue result in fever, vomiting, and lack of appetite. Stress of the immune system uses up micronutrients and energy and can lead to deterioration in nutritional status. Pregnant women with malaria have an increased risk of delivering a LBW baby. The change in climate has also been linked with increased dengue and malaria. PVH is an are a with high risk for malaria and dengue, particularly in forested areas and in the rainy season. MSF are conducting malaria prevention projects in PVH, however they have not been implemented in Choam Ksant district. It appears that most households own mosq uito nets, but information on who sleeps under the nets is not available. B. High prevalence of illness in children under 5 years Acute infections have been shown to cause growth faltering in children under 5years, with continual bouts of infection during th e first 2 -years of life reducing linear growth. Undernutrition also increases the risk of becoming ill, causing a dangerous cyclical relationship. In the last 14 days, diarrhoea was reported in 19% of children in PVH and fever in 32.6%. Deworming medicatio n had been received by 62.2% of CU5 in the last 6 -months (DHS 2014). High prevalence of illness in Choam Ksant appears to be in most part, due to poor hygiene and sanitation practices and unhygienic environments with open defecation a common practice . C. Delivery without skilled professionals Those who deliver without a skilled professional are less likely to have attended PNC, and are less likely to attend ANC where they should receive skilled advice on IYCF and care practices as well as maternal health and n utrition. These factors increase the risk of low birthweight, poor child growth and poor nutritional status. In the last 5 years 48.8% of live births were at home in PVH, with 54.4% delivered by a skilled provider (DHS 2014). There is a suggestion that gra ndmothers play a role in this decision making (KII) and additionally, health seeking behavior in general is constrained by cost, distance and time. There is also some discussion around whether skilled advice is being given at ANC/PNC and the capacity of th e skilled health professionals in Choam Ksant. D. Early child bearing Early childbearing is associated with a higher risk of low birthweight and subsequent increased risk of poor growth of the child. Additionally, early childbearing is associated with a lack of knowledge of proper maternal and IYCF practices. Of women aged 15 -19 years in PVH, 25.5% had begun childbearing (DHS 2014). Culturally in rural Cambodia women marry young, and there is an expectation to have children soon after. E. Mother's employment and season migration High workload of mothers increases the risk of poor breastfeeding and care practices due to the absence and lack of time of the mother, which increase the risk of child undernutrition. In PVH, 70.4% of women aged 15 -49 years were current ly employed in the DHS 2014 , of which 78.4% work in agriculture which means they are outside of the household (DHS 2014). During the dry season, mothers from poor families often migrate for work. This is increasing due to depleting of local resources in th e forests historically used to generate income in the dry season. In both cases, children are often left at home , with elder family members or older siblings taking care for them. In the 136 absence of mothers, adequate infant and youn g child feeding are not a dopted r esult ing in increased risk for child illness, wasting and stunting. F. Gender issues and m aternal well ness There is some evidence to suggest that poor maternal well -being can affect the care practices of children, impacting on child growth. In PVH, women are traditionally responsible for household chores as well as being employed, leaving little time to rest or time for themselves. It seems that decisions are often made by discussion between mothers and fathers, but that the male will sometimes be the final decision maker. In PVH, 31.8% of women had experienced violence since the age of 15. The perpetrator of violence was most often the husband/partner or parent. There are reports that poverty causes mothers to cry and complain, and also increase the ri sk of domestic violence (KIIs). In PVH 47.1% of HHs are in the lowest wealth quintile, and 27.3% in the second wealth quintile (DHS 2014). There is the suggestion that women experiencing domestic violence are more likely to migrate for work (KII), with eff ects on child feeding and care practices as children are often left at home G. Lack of e xposure to skilled health advice Poor health seeking behavior leads to prolonged and more serious illness, as well as less access to skilled health advice, increasing the risk of good health and care practices. Given the link between disease and nutrition, this increases the risk of poor child growth and nutritional status. In PVH it seems that mothers will use health centers, but it may not be the first choice with a histo rical preference to first seek local or traditional treatment methods. It seems this is due to the cost and distance/time associated with attending a health center, as well as poor perceived quality of health care. Not seeking skilled medical attention and advice will results in poor frequent and prolonged illness in children with a subsequent increased risk of undernutrition. Due to poor education, many do not have prior knowledge of health and nutrition, and with poor health seeking behavior and poor cove rage of nutrition and health activities in Choam Ksant district communities have poor exposure to skilled advice on health and nutrition, increasing the risk of illness, and deterioration with poor nutritional status. Another issue here is the capacity of the health staff and VHSGs, which are often the first contact point with healthcare for communities. It seems in terms of immunisations, there may be some cultural beliefs around the bad side effects of the immunisations and pain of the injection. H. Open def ecation and unhygienic environments Lack of access to sanitation facilities is linked to increased risk of disease such as diarrhoea and intestinal parasites. Open defecation and unsafe disposal of feces (human and animal) introduces germs into the environ ment. Increased illness leads to increased risk of poor child growth in communities, not just at HH level. In PVH, only 10 -50% of HHs are reported to have access to latrines in Choam Ksant district (KIIs). Although there are a number of projects to improve latrine access in PVH, this doesn't seem to have reached Choam Ksant district. With a lack of knowledge about sanitation and hygiene with o nly 50% of child's stools are disposed of safely (IMCF Baseline Survey, 2012) , and limited household income this is not likely a priority for families. Additionally, the majority of households own animals or livestock which roam freely during the day. This, along with OD creates an unhygienic environment where children are likely to play. With increasing occurrence of f loods, this amplifies the unhygienic environment by spreading the germs and bacteria to a larger area. I. Inconsistent a ccess to clean water 137 Contaminated water increases the risk of diarrhoea, intestinal parasites and other water -borne diseases, and subsequen t deterioration of child nutritional status and growth. Access to clean water becomes limited in the dry season in PVH , with wells and hand pumps reported drying up due to overuse(KIIs) . The main source of water in villages is hand pumps and wells in the d ry season , and rain water in the wet season. It is reported that 87% of households have access to a clean water source (IMCF baseline report, 2012). However, it is reported that handpumps and wells become contaminated due to improper use (KIIs). Additional ly, it seems there is a lack of safe household storage for water; likely due to lack of knowledge as well as lack of income. Increasing occurrence of weather extremes such as floods and droughts are aggravating this situation. J. Poor h ygiene practices Poor hygiene practices increases the risk of diarrhoea and intestinal parasites leading to increased risk of poor child growth and nutritional status. In PVH 13% of caregivers reporting washing their hands after defecating (IMCF baseline survey, 2012). There a re also reports of children appearing unclean (KII). Although there are health promotion activities in the area, these are not widespread and it may be feasible to suggest that the lack of access to water impacts on households practicing these new behaviou rs. K. Inadequate breastfeeding practices WHO recommends a child is breastfed within the first hour of life and exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life for optimal health, with strong evidence for its impact on reduction of illness. Early introd uction of complementary foods has been associated with poor child growth. In PVH, early initiation of breastfeeding is at 77% (DHS 2014). However, it seems there is a cultural tradition to feed water and honey to newborns. I t also seems many mothers stop e xclusively breastfeeding at 4 -5 months with the likely implication of increased illness and early introduction of foods with subsequent increased risk of undernutrition and poor child growth. L. Inadequate c are practices Poor hygiene and sanitation practices during preparation or feeding of complementary foods increases the risk of child illness such as diarrhoea, which increases the risk of wasting and stunting. In Cambodia, it is common for children to eat alone which can result in small children not eating properly. Additionally, less than one third of respondents washed their hands with soap before preparing food leading to unsafe preparation of children's foods (IMCF baseline 2012). This is likely due to a lack of knowledge of good practices as well as cul tural practices. M. Poor quality diets of children under 5 years Poor quality diets of children leads to inadequate energy and nutrient intake needed for child growth and development. If a child is not receiving the adequate quantity of quality of food this results in increased risk of disease as well as poor child growth. Diarrhoea in particular causes zinc deficiencies, which have been linked to stunted growth in children. In PVH only 27.8% of children aged 6 -23 months reach the recommended minimum dietary d iversity (DHS 2014) and many are deficient in iron, zinc, vitamin A and thiamine. This is in part thought to be due to low crop diversity, with traditional rich -dominant diets. In Cambodia there is also a genetic mutation which is thought to cause anaemia. It is reported that mothers have poor knowledge on how to prepare nutritious meals for children, even when the food is available (KII), resulting in poor nutritional status and child growth as well as increased risk of childhood illness. There also seems to be an increasing trend of 'snack foods' for children in the villages such as packaged biscuits and crisps. 138 N. Poor n utritional status of women of child bearing age The first 1000 days of life from -9months to 23months are a crucial stage for proper child development and growth. Poor nutritional status of women of child bearing age and pregnant women is associated with low birthweight and IUGR due to insufficient fetal nutrition. Low birthweight infants have an increased risk of child malnutrition, poor grow th and poor health. In PVH, 16.4% of women aged 15 -49 were defined as thin by BMI<18.5 and 53.7% were anaemic (DHS 2014). In Cambodia there is a genetic mutation which is thought to cause anaemia, but there is also poor diversity of diets. PNC attendance is reportedly low and health seeking behavior is not optimum, therefore knowledge levels of appropriate diets are likely to be low. There is also a traditional practice to eat very simple foods after delivery. O. Household food insecurity Household food inse curity means less food at the household, this results in less calorific intake for household members and/or lower quality of diets through coping mechanisms. This increases the risk of poor child growth, and malnutrition in PLW during the food insecure per iod.In PVH, availability of rice determines HH food insecurity and hunger. Periodic food shortages occur close to the harvest seasons where there is less food available, and less income for those whose primary income is sale of crops to be able to access a dequate food . Recently, unpredictable rains have been causing problems for farmers and as such it is anticipated that household food security may increase. P. Agricultural dependence and poor crop diversity Farming systems in PVH are dominated by rice rain f ed system. Rice is the main staple food for the villagers, and when stocks from own production are over (lean season) farmers are seeking jobs out of their farms to purchase food. This happens at a critical time when rice is growing in the fields and requi re particular attention. This reduction in workforce results in a reduction of the rice production, which then impacts on the rice stock for the next season. This rain fed system is particularly vulnerable to recent climate change and extreme weather event s (droughts and floods). Farmers also borrow food or cash during the lean season, and reimburse from the sale of their rice production, after harvest when prices are low. This leads to a vicious cycle of rural poverty with 47.1% of HHs are in the lo west we alth quintile (DHS 2014). Rural poverty is associated with lower quantity and quality of diets, low education attainment, low healthcare access, and poor hygiene and sanitation facilities, all observed in PVH. This situation is aggrevated by the poor crop diversity in Cambodia, with farmers often growing only rice, or rice and Cassava - both of which are affected by poor rains. This reliance on one or two crops as a main source of food and income creates a very vulnerable state for the household. Q. Poor res ilience With many in PVH sitting just above the poverty line (87.3% in the lowest -middle wealth quintiles) and agricultural -dependence, many household are 'transient poor' with a lack of rural safety nets and a lack of technical skills and resources to cop e with any shocks or the increasing effects of weather extremes . With resilience on farming as a source of food and income, this is particularly problematic. Historically, natural resources such as the forest have acted as a safety net to communities, prov iding a way to diversify incomes and diets, especially during the dry season. Recent deforestation and the effects of climate change on natural resources such as fisheries, is putting these rural safety nets in jeopardy, as well as an increase in migration . Inability to deal with shocks can lead to sudden changes in food access and diet quality and quantity, increasing the risk of 139 wasting and disease. Continual exposure to fluctuations (e.g. seasonal) are likely to result in poor childhood growth. R. Poor kn owledge attainment Poor education is associated with risk of poor knowledge attainment of health and nutrition practices, which results in high risk of maternal and child undernutrition and illness. Whereas knowledge in itself will not lead to change in beha viours if there is not access to resources, poor education attainment is often linked to socio -economic factors and less health seeking behavior.Education attainment is poor for females in PVH with only 7.1% having completed primary education. It is sugges ted that this is, in part, due to children being required to begin work at an early age due to rural household poverty. Around 30% of respondents named unclean hands as a cause of diarrhoea, and around 4% poor sanitation (IMCF baseline survey, 2012). As we ll as poor education, a lack of coverage by health promotion activities is likely a contributing factor. Poor knowledge attainment of health, nutrition and hygiene increases the risk of poor nutritional status and health. S. Poor a wareness of malnutrition Health workers have limited capacity in their understanding of the different types of malnutrition, and awareness in communities is also reportedly low with little understanding of the symptoms and effects of malnutrition. Poor awareness of malnutrition will lead to poor prioritization of malnutrition prevention. T. Low income and limited livelihoods Low income and limited access and diversity to livelihoods was multi -causal and should be a risk factor on its own. In PVH, households facing constraints of only fam ing or seasonal labour livelihoods are likely to struggle to generate enough income to escape rural poverty. This means that there is often very little spare income for improved living such as household latrines, water pumps or education. This will be depe ndent on the communities or individual family's priorities. An exasperating factor here is the social habits of gambling, alcoholism and some reports of prostitution in some communities. Income affects many of the other risk factors for undernutrition e.g. household food insecurity, nutrit ional status of WCBA and WASH. U. Limited access to markets and poor infrastructure PVH is very remote with many isolated villages. It seems there is not much flow of information or services from one village to the next, due in part to the linear geography of villages alone one road. Those on the outside (furthest in to the remote areas) will not receive any services or visits from neighbouring villages as people will tend to travel only one way along the road in the directio n of the nearest large town. Additionally, some areas still poor road access, with some not accessible by car. This situation expands to a number of villages in the rainy season, when access is difficult to a number of areas. There are not always m arkets w ithin villages , and if they do they are often small and limited with minor links to other villages and markets. This impacts on diversity of markets and hence diets, as well as limiting the economic productivity of agricultural products. Additionally, poor infrastructure impacts on access to villages in terms of health education and other beneficial programmes. One reason for this is thought to be a lack of investment from the government and limited commune budgets leading to basic services, poor infrastruc ture and limited development. 140 List of R eferences A.
