HBT (Homeopathic Balance Therapy) is a study and practice based in the understanding of human chemistry (HC), developed by [Ton Jansen](http://humanchemistry.eu/), the tenets of which are explained in his book - Fighting Fire with Fire - Real treatment solutions for 21st century diseases. I often use HBT (aka HCM - Human Chemistry Method) as part of the ongoing constitutional care for many of my clients, if there appears to be a block, in the attempt to address the \"root cause\" of their ongoing symptoms. My balancing programs include a combination of homeopathic remedies, [gemmos](http://innervoicehomeopathy.com/gemmotherapy/), and dietary changes. Sometimes, it may also include some orthomolecular supplements, mainly Zinc, Vitamin C, Vitamin D3, Vitamin B12... but, usually I find that the gemmos provide the adequate and necessary nutrients and cleansing support to the organs involved in the clearing and balancing process. For some of our complex ASD cases, as mentioned in his book, [Autism Reversal Toolkit](https://rightwhalepress.com/autism-reversal-toolbox/), Jerry Kantor and I collaborate together to design a comprehensive healing course of action for our mutual clients.
