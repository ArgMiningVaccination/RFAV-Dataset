Getting a flu vaccine is an essential part of protecting your health and your family's health. Flu shots may be even more important this year, as many communities continue to see community spread of COVID-19. The [symptoms of flu](https://www.uofmhealth.org/conditions-treatments/flu-information) and [COVID-19](https://www.uofmhealth.org/covid-19-update) are similar, and clinics may experience higher demand for flu symptom evaluation if we have a bad flu season during the COVID-19 pandemic. Flu shots not only prevent many cases of influenza, but also decrease the severity of illness for someone who is vaccinated but still develops the flu. [Learn about symptoms, diagnosis and treatment for the flu](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm). Who should get a flu shot? The [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/index.htm) recommends annual influenza vaccination for everyone 6 months and older. Flu vaccination is especially important for adults 65 years and older, who account for most hospitalizations and deaths from flu. High dose flu shots are recommended for adults age 65 and over. High-dose flu shots are recommended for adults age 65 and over. High-dose flu vaccines will be available at any Michigan Medicine's regional flu clinics and at Michigan Medicine health centers. No special scheduling request is necessary beyond the standard flu shot appointment. Where can I get a flu shot? - Make an appointment to get a flu vaccine at one of our health centers. We offer flu shot appointments at several of our health centers. U-M Health patients may self-schedule a flu shot online through the [MyUofMhealth patient portal](http://www.myuofmhealth.org/). If you do not have a portal account, you can schedule an appointment by calling 734-763-6336. - Get a flu shot at your next scheduled appointment. If you already have an appointment at a U-M Health primary care clinic, ask to receive a flu shot while you're there. Many specialists also offer flu shots through their clinics. Contact your specialty clinic about whether you can get your flu vaccine at your next scheduled appointment. - Look for a community flu shot clinic. University of Michigan Health administers several walk-in flu vaccine clinics for patients 9 years and older.

When should I get a flu shot? It is best to get a flu vaccine before flu viruses begin spreading in your community, so you have begun developing influenza antibodies to protect you against contracting the flu. The CDC recommends that you get a flu shot by the end of October, but it's not too late to benefit from some level of protection even as late as January. NOTE: COVID-19 vaccines and flu vaccines may be administered at the same visit. You may receive both vaccines safely, with no wait time in between. However, at Michigan Medicine, the two vaccines must each be scheduled. Keeping Our Patients Safe from the Flu Michigan Medicine has joined dozens of health care institutions throughout the country in requiring staff to be vaccinated against flu or to wear a protective mask during any patient interaction during flu season. The requirement is designed to help protect the health of our patients and their families and will especially protect the many people we care for who have serious medical conditions and weakened immune systems.
