Muth Donald W. Anderson Jean L. Domanico Jennifer B. Smith Brett Wendling Center for Economics Research Research Triangle Institute Research Triangle Park, NC 27709iiiPREFACE The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) contracted with Research Triangle Institute (RTI) to collect information and report on the nature, size, and scope of the dietary supplement industry.This document is the final draft of the Dietary Supplement Industry Characterization Reportprovided under the contract. The products that are the focus of the report are based on the definition of dietary supplements in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA). They are the following: Z vitamins; Z minerals; Z herbals and other botanicals; Z amino acids; Z dietary substances used to supplement the diet by increasing its total daily intake; and Z concentrates, metabolites, constituents, extracts, and combinations of these ingredients. In addition, these products must be intended for ingestion in pill, capsule, tablet, or liquid form; must not be represented as a food or sole item of a meal or diet; and must be labeled as a\"supplement.\" FDA requires the information contained in this report to aid in conducting regulatory impact analyses under DSHEA. According to Young and Bass (1994), DSHEA Z establishes dietary supplements as a new category of food, Z defines dietary supplements and ingredients, Z includes enforcement provisions for adulteration standards, Z excludes accompanying literature from the definition of labeling and thus allows it under certain conditions, Z allows for a claim of benefit and role of the product on its label, Z establishes labeling practices regarding ingredients and nutrition, Z requires pre-market notification of new dietary ingredients, Z authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue regulations prescribing good manufacturing practices (GMPs), Z establishes a commission on dietary supplement labels, and Z establishes an office of dietary supplements within the National Institutes of Health. Nearly all information contained in this report was obtained from secondary data sources. In addition to searching secondary data sources, RTI met with the following individuals in the courseof obtaining information on the industry:ivZ Loren D. Israelsen, President, Utah Natural Products Alliance; Z Jill Ellis, Director of Science & Quality Assurance, National Nutritional Foods Association; Z John Hathcock, Director of Nutritional & Regulatory Science, and John Cordaro, President and Chief Executive Officer, Council for Responsible Nutrition; Z Jeffrey M. Morrison, President, American Herbal Products Association; and Z Patrice B. Wright, Director of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Nonprescription Drug Manufacturers Association. Summaries of RTI's interviews with these individuals were provided previously to FDA in site visit summary reports.vCONTENTS Preface iii 1. Introduction 1-12.

For these reasons,characterizing the industry is difficult. Furthermore, the industry has experienced tremendousgrowth recently due to increased consumer interest in these products, so information on theindustry is continually being updated. This report contains the most recent information available from secondary data sources on the size, scope, and nature of the DS industry. The products that are the focus of the report, whichare based on the definition of a dietary supplement as contained in the Dietary SupplementHealth and Education Act (DSHEA) of 1994, are: Vitamins Products that are organic (carbon-containing) nutrients that are essential in small quantities for normal metabolism, growth, and well-being. They must be obtainedthrough the diet because they either are not synthesized in the body or are notsynthesized in adequate amounts. Minerals Products that are chemical elements in their inorganic forms. \"Minerals\" are those that are required in amounts greater than 100 mg/day, and \"trace minerals\" arethose required in lesser amounts. Herbals & Botanicals(other thanextracts)Herbal or botanical products prepared by means other than extraction (i.e., dried, crushed, and encapsulated). These may include teas in addition to other productforms. The term herbal refers to the leaves and stems of the plant while botanical refers to these parts in addition to roots, seeds, and fruits. Herbal and BotanicalExtractsProducts that are extracts made from any part of a plant. Animal ExtractsProducts that are extracts made from animal parts (e.g., tissues and glands). Amino Acids Products that contain an amino group and an acidic function. Proteins Products with the complete set of amino acids to make up proteins.Concentrates, Metabolites,ConstituentsProducts that are concentrated, are broken down into individual components, or are parts of other products. Teas Products infused in water that contain herbals, botanicals, or other DS products. Basic tea products have a standard of identity as a food product; however, manyproducts are a combination of tea and dietary supplements. Other Dietary SupplementsAll other products meeting the criteria of dietary supplements that cannot be classified into the categories above. They include, for example, bee pollen,propolis, and royal jelly; coenzyme Q; spirulina and other algaes; and nucleic acids.1-2While some of these products (i.e., vitamins, minerals, and proteins) are taken because they are essential nutrients, others are taken for other reasons. In particular, herbal and botanical productsare generally taken for reasons other than nutrition, although current FDA regulations restrict thetypes of claims allowed on the product. Products other than vitamins and minerals are only in theinitial stages of standardization by members of the industry; thus, even a particular type maycontain many heterogeneous products. As one would expect, the production processes vary greatlyboth between product types and within a product type. Industry statistics are difficult to come by because these products are scattered across at least eight different 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC codes) and nearly 80 different 6-digitinternational codes. In addition, different trade organizations cover varying aspects of theindustry. These include the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which in the past concentratedprimarily on vitamins and minerals but is now branching out into other DS products; theAmerican Herbal Products Association, which contains primarily smaller herbal and botanicalproduct manufacturers but is adding larger members over time; the Nonprescription DrugManufacturers, which represents the larger over-the-counter pharmaceutical manufacturers, manyof which produce vitamins and minerals; the Utah Natural Products Alliance, which representseight large firms that are located in Utah but that have national distribution channels; and theNational Nutritional Foods Association, which covers retailers in addition to manufacturers and isworking on standardizing products. Many other smaller organizations represent various aspectsof the industry as well. The distribution channels for products are many and varied and include channels through which companies Z manufacture and sell their products within their own stores, Z manufacture products and private-label them for retail outlets, and Z manufacture products with a brand name label for sale in retail outlets. In addition, a large volume of sales is through direct sellers such as mail order and multilevel marketing. Figure 1-1 reproduces from Nutrition Business Journal an outline of the distribution channels for all nutrition products. As represented, the raw material providers and manufacturersare distinct among the natural food, DS, and natural personal care lines, but the product linesshare common distributors and retailers. However, this diagram does not clearly indicate theextent to which foreign firms are part of the distribution structure. International trade is a largecomponent of the DS industry as many products sold in the U.S. are manufactured from importedraw ingredients or are imported as finished products.1-3Figure 1-1.

September 1998. \"$23 Billion and Counting: Nutrition Industry Braces for a Competitive Future.\" Nutrition Business Journal 3(9):1-5, 13, 18.1-4In the following sections, we provide more detailed information on the DS industry as a whole. In Section 2, we provide an overview of production practices for the different types of DSproducts. In Section 3, we summarize information on the facilities and firms as contained in theDietary Supplement Enhanced Establishment Database (DS-EED), which is being created by RTI.In Section 4, we describe the uses and consumers of DS products and discuss substitutionpossibilities. Sales and marketing of DS products as well as industry structure are described inSection 5. Finally, we include information on SIC codes, international codes, and industrystatistics, as well as projections, in Section 6.2-1SECTION 2 PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS Dietary supplements are made up of a diverse group of products, so production practices differ as much as the products themselves. Even within a particular category of DS products, there may bemany different types of production processes. However, information on how the products areproduced is necessary for characterizing the supply of DS products. In this section, we describethe production processes for vitamins, minerals, herbals and botanicals, amino acids, proteins,and other DS products, as well as the final dosage forms of all DS products. Good manufacturingpractices (GMPs) and costs of manufacturing are also described briefly. 2.1 PRODUCTION PROCESSES FOR DS PRODUCTS Within each DS product type are numerous different individual substances. For example, 11vitamins and 13 minerals have been identified as essential nutrients for humans (Clayman, 1994),but additional nonessential vitamins and minerals have been identified as well (see Tables 2-1and 2-2). Perhaps several hundred herbal and botanical products have been manufactured forhuman consumption. In this section, we summarize the production practices for each type of DSproduct for which we were able to obtain information. In addition to the primary DS producttypes, we also include information on algaes, bee products, and teas. 2.1.1 Production Processes for Vitamins Vitamins are a group of organic (carbon-containing) compounds that must be consumed in the diet in small quantities for normal metabolism, growth, and health (Hendler, 1990). Thirteensubstances have been identified as vitamins for humans. Vitamins A, D, E, and K arecharacterized as fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamins B of Chemical Technology,1996). Table 2-1 lists these vitamins along with information on their presence in foods, methodsused for commercial production, companies engaged in production, and quantities produced.There are three basic methods for producing vitamins on a commercial scale: (1) synthesis,(2) fermentation, and (3) extraction from natural products. Table 2-1 also indicates which of thesethree methods is used for each vitamin. The following is a brief description of each method. Synthesis Synthesis, which involves the production of vitamins through the combination of basic chemicals, is by far the most widely used method of production. First, scientists determine how to synthesizethe compounds in a laboratory; then manufacturers scale up the processes to industrial volumes.As Table 2-1 indicates, vitamin B 12 is the only one of the 13 vitamins that is not produced synthetically.Table 2-1.

Whitehouse Station, NJ: Merck. 2-32-4Fermentation Fermentation is a process whereby bacteria are grown in tanks. The tanks, called \"fermenters,\" are filled with a nutrient-rich medium and are inoculated with a strain of bacteria that willproduce the desired vitamin. The fermenters are held at controlled temperatures to allow thebacteria to multiply at an optimum rate. Bacterial cells are then separated from the medium withfilters or centrifuges, and the mass of cells is dried. Evaporation or spray drying can also be usedto separate the cells from the medium. Various processes, which may include heating and theaddition of chemicals, are then used to lyse, or break open, the cells, releasing the vitamin-richcell contents. Further purification and concentration follows and may include solvent extraction.Several vitamins are produced through fermentation, and scientists are striving to improvetechniques. Vitamin B 12 is produced on an industrial scale exclusively through fermentation (Ullman's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 1996). Extraction from Natural Products Scientists originally isolated each of the vitamins from some natural source. Vitamins A and D were originally isolated from fish liver oil; vitamin E from wheat germ oil; vitamin K from alfalfa;vitamins B 1 and B 6 from rice; vitamin B 2 from eggs; and vitamin B 12, niacin, folic acid, pantothenic acid, and biotin from liver. Although it is possible to extract all vitamins from naturalproducts, it is generally infeasible on an industrial scale. An exception to this is vitamin E, whichis produced in large quantities from a by-product of vegetable oil production. Relatively smallquantities of vitamins A and D are also extracted from fish oils. Various processes are used forextraction, including distillation and solvent extraction (Ullman's Encyclopedia of ChemicalTechnology, 1996). 2.1.2 Production Processes for Minerals Unlike vitamins, which are organic substances, minerals are inorganic compounds that are required in small quantities in the diet to maintain health. Inorganic substances that humansrequire in quantities greater than 100 milligrams per day are called \"minerals,\" and those requiredin quantities less than 100 milligrams per day are called \"trace elements\" (Hendler, 1990).Table 2-2 lists 17 minerals that are commonly consumed in dietary supplements, along with theforms of the minerals used in supplements. Minerals, by their nature, come from the earth. Theyare derived from rocks or soils or may come from sea or lake water. Mineral supplements that arecalled \"plant minerals\" may actually be mined from deposits of sedimentary rock. Chelated and Colloidal Minerals Two forms of mineral supplements are marketed as being more easily absorbed by the body. These are chelated and colloidal minerals. A chelating agent is a molecule that binds to metal.Chelated minerals used in dietary supplements have been processed so that the metal2-5Table 2-2.

A colloid is a suspension of extremely fine particles in a continuous medium. These particles do notsettle out readily and are not readily filtered (The American Heritage Dictionary, 1985). Colloidalminerals used as dietary supplements are minerals that have been ground into very small particlesand have been suspended in water. Colloidal mineral supplements come in liquid form (Reach 4Life, 1998). 2.1.3 Production Processes for Herbals and Botanicals Dietary supplements from plant sources are sometimes referred to as \"phytopharmaceuticals.\" They are produced from fresh, dried or otherwise preserved plants or parts of plants. The activeingredients are usually not completely isolated but rather are obtained along with other naturallyoccurring components of the plant. (These other components are often believed to influence theefficacy of the active ingredient.) Sometimes the active ingredients are concentrated, andundesirable substances such as chlorophyll, tannins, or resins, are removed (List and Schmidt,1989). The following sections discuss the various stages of production of dietary supplements ofplant origin. Cultivation and Collection of Plant Materials Most of the plants used for dietary supplements or medicinal purposes are cultivated, that is, grown on farms. Some, however, may be collected from the wild (Wijesekera, 1991). Thefollowing section discusses both methods for obtaining botanicals or herbals. Cultivation. Cultivation allows producers to have more control over quality and purity than does collecting plants from the wild. Cultivars (cultivated varieties) of a number of medicinal plantspecies have been developed to produce high yields of the desired constituents. Some plants thatare grown commercially for medicinal purposes are propagated vegetatively. (This means thatnew plants are grown from cuttings of old plants. Plants grown in this way are geneticallyidentical to the parent plant.) Some medicinal plants are grown from selectively bred hybridseeds, while others are varieties of plants that are unchanged from their natural form (Wijesekera,1991). A number of medicinal plants are cultivated for use by the pharmaceutical industry. Some examples include yams, which are used in the production of steroids; foxglove, which is used fordigitalis; belladona, which is used for atropine; and opium, which is used to make morphine. Thefollowing is a list of major, commercially cultivated medicinal plants, many of which are used indietary supplements (Wijesekera, 1991):2-7Aconites of countries commercially cultivate and export substantial quantities of medicinal plants. These countries include China, India, Thailand, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Egypt,Indonesia, Nepal, the Philippines, and Kenya. Eastern European countries cultivate medicinalplants as well, but mostly for their own consumption (Wijesekera, 1991). As for any agricultural crop, producers of medicinal plants must provide plants with adequate moisture and nutrients and must control pests and diseases. Pesticides must be used cautiously toreduce the risk of harmful residues on plants (List and Schmidt, 1989). Production of medicinalplants is generally labor intensive. In many cases, only the portions of the plant that contain theactive ingredients\u2014not the whole plant\u2014are used. Sometimes harvesting involves picking leavesand flowers by hand (Hornok, 1992). In the future, tissue culture may be used for producingplant material (List and Schmidt, 1989). Collection from the Wild. Tropical forests are the source of a number of plants used for medicinal purposes. There are several disadvantages to collecting wild plants, however. Thispractice, along with deforestation, has caused some wild plant species to become endangered(Wijesekera, 1991). Also, when plants are collected from the wild, there is a risk that they havebeen incorrectly identified (List and Schmidt, 1989). One advantage to using wild plants,however, is that they are unlikely to contain any pesticide residues (Wijesekera, 1991). Cleaning. After the plants are harvested or gathered, they must be cleaned. Cleaning may involve screening, washing, peeling, or stripping leaves from stems. Any unnecessary parts areremoved prior to drying to avoid wasting time and energy. Cleaning is often done by hand(Hornok, 1992). Drying. In some cases, botanicals are used for extraction while fresh, but generally, they are dried first. The purpose of drying is to reduce the water content so that the plant can be stored.Most plants contain 60 to 80 percent moisture when harvested and must be dried to within 10 to2-814 percent moisture before storage. Plants must be dried or processed as soon as possible after harvest because they begin to deteriorate immediately. Processing up to this point is generallydone by the producer of the plants (Hornok, 1992). Plants can be dried naturally or by a numberof artificial methods. The type of plant or plant part being used will determine the appropriatedrying technique (List and Schmidt, 1989). Natural Drying. A practice that has been used since ancient times is sun-drying in the field. Although this method requires no drying equipment and uses solar energy, it requires largeamounts of space, and plants can be damaged by the weather. Sometimes plants are placed byhand on drying frames or stands, to be air-dried in barns or sheds. This method of drying is labor-intensive and can take several weeks. The exact length of time for adequate drying depends ontemperature and humidity (Hornok, 1992). Artificial Drying. With the use of artificial dryers, drying time can be reduced to hours or minutes, and labor can also be greatly reduced. Fans that blow unheated air (cold-air drying) canreduce drying time to several days. Warm-air drying, which is the most widely used method formedicinal plants, uses a counter-current flow of warm air. There are several different types ofsystems for warm-air drying. One type is the plate chamber dryer, which blows warm air acrossplates on which plants have been placed. This method is useful for fragile flowers and leaves butrequires large amounts of labor. Workers must load and unload the plants from the platesmanually. The capacity of these dryers is relatively low, as well. Conveyor dryers are a commonly used type of warm-air dryer. Fresh plants travel on a conveyor belt through a counter-current flow of warm air. These dryers can operate continuously, requirerelatively little labor, and have high throughput. However, they require a large capital investmentand have high energy requirements. The drying time required for conveyor dryers ranges from2.5 to 6 hours, and the temperature of the drying air ranges from 40 to 80\u00baC. Hot air dryers,which use very high temperatures (200 to 1,000\u00baC) for very short periods (2 to 5 minutes) are notcommonly used for drying medicinal plants (Hornok, 1992). Packaging of Dried Plants Once drying is complete, plants are packaged in preparation for shipping and further processing. Dried herbaceous plants are generally compressed into bales weighing from 60 to 100 kg (13 to220 pounds), which are then sewn into fabric bags or wrapped in plastic. Materials that cannotbe baled, such as roots and bark, are placed in sacks. Smaller bags may be used for densematerials such as dried fruits or seeds. Very fragile materials, such as flowers, are packaged incrates. Dried plant materials tend to be hygroscopic (readily absorbing moisture) and must bestored under controlled humidity. Highly hygroscopic materials are generally packed in plastic(Hornok, 1992).2-9Cleaning and Sorting When the sacks or bales arrive at the processing facility, processors open the packages and clean the dried plants to remove as many impurities as possible. Sand is removed pneumatically andiron-containing metals are removed magnetically. Next, processors sort the plant pieces by size,since different end-uses require different particle sizes. For example, finely shredded materialmay be used for tea bags and somewhat less finely shredded material for loose teas or infusions,while coarsely shredded material may be sold directly to consumers or used for extraction.Particles that are already the desired size can go directly into storage to await further processing.Particles that are too big undergo additional grinding, cutting or shredding, and sieving. Variousmethods are used to reduce particle size including hammer action, pressure, friction, impactcutting, and shredding (List and Schmidt, 1989). Some plant materials are packaged and sold atthis point without any additional processing. Some proceed through an extraction process, whichthe following section describes. Extraction Extraction is a process whereby the desired constituents of a plant are removed using a solvent. The following section describes several methods used for preparing extracts, including organicsolvent extraction, supercritical gas extraction, and steam distillation. Organic Solvent Extraction. Organic solvent extraction is one process for separating the desired substance from plant material. As was previously mentioned, dried plants are usually used forextraction, although fresh plants are sometimes used. The plants are first ground and thenthoroughly mixed with a solvent such as hexane, benzene, or toluene inside a tank. The choiceof solvent depends on several factors including the characteristics of the constituents beingextracted, cost, and environmental issues. If the end product will contain trace amounts ofresidual solvent, a nontoxic solvent must be used. Once the solvent dissolves the desiredsubstances of the plant, it is called \"miscella.\" The miscella is then separated from the plantmaterial (Hornok, 1992). There are a number of techniques for solvent extraction, which includemaceration, percolation, and countercurrent extraction. The following is a brief description ofeach. Z Maceration: This method involves soaking and agitating the solvent and plant materials together. The solvent is then drained off. Remaining miscella is removed from the plantmaterial through pressing or centrifuging. This method does not totally extract the activeingredients from the plant materials. Z Percolation: With this method, the plant material is moistened with solvent and allowed to swell before being placed in one of a series of percolation chambers. The material isrepeatedly rinsed with solvent until all the active ingredient has been removed. Solvent isreused until it is saturated. New solvent is used on plant material that is almostcompletely exhausted, and then re-used on subsequently less exhausted batches. Thismethod is more effective at removing active ingredients than the maceration technique.2-10Z Countercurrent extraction: This is a highly effective process whereby solvent flows in the opposite direction to plant material. Unlike maceration and percolation, which are batchprocesses, this method is continuous. Screw extractors and carousel extractors are twotypes of equipment used for countercurrent extraction (Wijesekera, 1991). Purification and Concentration of Miscella. Miscella that has been separated from the plant material generally contains some unwanted substances such as tannins, pigments, microbialcontaminants, or residual solvent. Methods such as decanting, filtration, sedimentation,centrifuging, heating, adsorption, precipitation, and ion exchange are used to separate impuritiesfrom the miscella. Sometimes the miscella resulting from solvent extraction is used as the finaldosage form. This is known as a \"fluid extract\" (List and Schmidt, 1989). The miscella is sometimes concentrated in order to increase the proportion of the desired substance. This is done through evaporation or vaporization. Solvent is generally recovered andreused (List and Schmidt, 1989). The degree of concentration depends on the desired endproduct. Equipment for concentrating the miscella may include descending film, thin layer orplate concentrators. Any method used to concentrate the miscella must avoid excessive heatbecause the active compounds may be subject to degradation (Wijesekera, 1991). Sometimesextracts are dried completely using vacuum freeze dryers, cabinet vacuum dryers, continuouslyoperating drum or belt dryers, microwave ovens, or atomizers. The technique for drying dependson the stability of the product and the amount of moisture that must be removed. The resultingpowdered extract is less subject to microbial contamination than are liquid extracts (Hornok,1992). Extraction with Supercritical Gases. This is a method for extracting active ingredients using gases. The plant material is placed in a vessel that is filled with a gas under controlledtemperature and high pressure. The gas dissolves the active ingredients within the plant material,then passes into a separating chamber where both pressure and temperature are lower. Theextract precipitates out and is removed through a valve at the bottom of the chamber. The gas isthen reused. Gases suitable for supercritical extraction include carbon dioxide, nitrogen,methane, ethane, ethylene, nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide, propane, propylene, ammonia, andsulfur hexafluoride. An advantage of supercritical extraction is that it can take place at lowtemperature, thus preserving the quality of temperature-sensitive components (List and Schmidt,1989). Steam Distillation. Steam distillation is another method for extracting active ingredients from medicinal plants. The plant material is loaded onto perforated plates inside a cylindrical tank orstill, and steam is injected from below. The steam dissolves the desired substances in the plant,then enters a condenser where it is condensed back into a liquid. This condensate then passesinto a flask, where the extract either rises to the top or settles to the bottom and is separated fromthe water. Distillation is complete when there is no more extract present in the condensate. Thewater may be reused, and the extract is purified through centrifuging and filtering (Hornok, 1992).2-11Other Minor Extraction Methods. Other minor methods for making extracts include cold pressing and the enfleurage process. Cold pressing is a process used to extract essential oils fromcitrus plants through pressing (Hornok, 1992). The enfleurage process is the same as thetechnique used to make perfume from flowers: purified fats are used to extract essential oils fromplant parts. Plant material is spread onto sheets of purified fat, which dissolve the essential oils(List and Schmidt, 1989). Sometimes practitioners of herbal medicine prepare extracts for immediate use. These include aqueous extracts known as decoctions, infusions, or macerations. Plant material is mixed,agitated, and soaked in water to dissolve the active ingredients. Controlling microbialcontamination can be difficult in aqueous extracts. Oily drug extracts, also called \"medicinaloils,\" may be prepared by soaking or macerating the plant material in an oil such as almond,peanut, olive, poppy seed, apricot kernel, or peach kernel oil. Vinegar is sometimes used toextract active ingredients as well. Plant materials are soaked in acetic acid, and the vinegar isconsumed as the final dosage form (List and Schmidt, 1989). Controlling the Quality of Extracts Once an extract has been produced by one of the methods mentioned above, producers can use a number of tests to evaluate the quality and purity of their product. First, they may examine thephysical characteristics of the extract. This may include evaluating its appearance, pH, solubility,total solids content, ash content, and in the case of dried extracts, particle size. Next, they mayanalyze the components of the extract to be certain it contains the appropriate quantities ofdesired ingredients. Chromatography (including thin layer, column, high pressure liquid, and gaschromatography) may be used for this. Finally, they may test the extract for impurities such asresidual solvents, herbicides, and pesticides and for microbial contamination (Wijesekera, 1991). Some extracts are labeled and sold as standardized extracts. According to industry sources, the desired constituents in standardized extracts are measured and are listed as a percentage of thetotal weight of the extract. For example, echinacosides are the desired compounds present inechinacea extract. A capsule containing 250 mg of echinacea extract standardized to 4 percentwould contain 10 mg of echinacosides. In some cases, the desired constituent is a known activeingredient. In cases where the active ingredient has not been identified, another \"marker \"compound, or substance that is known to be present in the plant, may be measured for thepurpose of standardization. Spectrophotometric testing and high pressure liquid chromatographymay be used to measure standardized constituents ( Standardized Extract Product Guide , 1997). 2.1.4 Production Processes for Amino Acids Amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins, are known as \"chiral\" compounds. This means that they exist in two forms that are mirror images of one another, like right and left hands.Amino acids are identified as either L or D, to indicate the chiral form of the molecule. Livingorganisms can only use the L form of amino acids, and are unable to recognize the D form. The2-12amino acids used in dietary supplements are generally the L form and are labeled as such (L-cystein, L-lysine). Amino acids used in dietary supplements can be made through either synthesis or fermentation. The synthesis of an amino acid starts with basic chemicals and results in a 50-50 distribution ofthe L and D forms. Since the D form is useless to humans, it is generally removed. Thefermentation process for producing amino acids uses yeasts that are fed nutrients from plantsources such as corn or soy. The yeasts are grown under controlled conditions and the aminoacids are extracted from the yeast (see Section 2.1.1 on vitamins for a more detailed description ofthe fermentation process). Since yeasts are living organisms, this method results in 100 percentL-form amino acids (Heartland Lysine, 1998; Musashi USA, 1998). 2.1.5 Production Processes for Proteins Various types of purified plant and animal proteins are sold as dietary supplements in the form of powders or granules. Soy is a major source of these proteins. The term soy protein refers to a processed, edible dry soybean product. The production of soy proteins for human consumption isgenerally a separate process from the production of vegetable oils or animal feeds. Soybeans thatare rejected from the food-grade process are diverted to these other uses. Some generalcategories of soy proteins are full-fat soy flour, defatted soy flour, soy protein concentrates, andsoy protein isolates. Full-fat soy flour, which is about 40 percent protein, is made by grindingwhole, dried soybeans. Defatted soy protein is made from soybeans that have undergone solventextraction to remove oil. It contains 52 to 54 percent protein. Soy protein concentrates are floursthat have had all water or alcohol-soluble components removed. These are at least 65 percentprotein. Soy protein isolates, which are 90 percent protein, are concentrates that have been rid offiber. Soy concentrates and isolates often undergo additional processing, such as pH adjustmentor hydrolysis, before drying. (Hydrolysis is the decomposition of a compound by reaction withwater.) There are numerous options for further processing soy proteins, many of which are tradesecrets (Erickson, 1995). Whey and casein are two other types of protein used in dietary supplements. Both are products of the dairy industry. Whey is a by-product of the manufacture of cheese, and casein is the mainprotein found in milk and cheese. Other sources of protein used in dietary supplements includeeggs, grains and other vegetable sources, and collagen, which is extracted from the cartilage andconnective tissue of slaughtered animals. 2.1.6 Production Processes for Animal Products Some dietary supplements of animal origin are compounds that have been purified from parts of animals, using techniques such as solvent extraction or column chromatography, while others arecomposed of whole concentrated animal tissue. For example, chondroitin sulfate, a dietarysupplement used to relieve symptoms of arthritis, is extracted mainly from bovine trachea, orsometimes from shark cartilage (Sturtz, 1998). Dietary supplements known as \"glandulars\" are2-13raw animal glands such as the pituitary, prostate, or thyroid glands that have been lyophilized (freeze-dried) and placed in capsules or tablets (110% Products, 1998). 2.1.7 Production Processes for Other DS Products A number of dietary supplements are not included in this section on production processes because information is not available from secondary sources. In addition, any availableinformation on the dietary supplements referred to as \"constituents, metabolites, andconcentrates\" has been included in one of the other categories. For example, concentratedextracts are discussed in the section on Herbals and Botanicals. Available information on severalmiscellaneous dietary supplements is presented below. Algae Single-celled algae, such as spirulina, have been consumed by humans throughout the world for centuries. The Aztecs harvested and consumed naturally occurring spirulina. At present, algaefor human consumption is produced by various means, ranging from harvesting it from naturallakes and ponds to using sophisticated fermentation equipment to create it. Algae requirescarbon, generally in the form of carbon dioxide, as well as nitrogen and phosphorus. It alsoneeds small quantities of micronutrients. Water that is polluted with organic waste is ideal forgrowing algae. Algae can be raised outdoors in lakes, ponds and ditches. It is harvested byskimming with screens or cloths. Sometimes flocculating agents, such as lime, are added to thewater to facilitate harvesting. After harvesting, the algae is dewatered through centrifuging anddried using sun drying, spray drying, or most often, drum drying (Encyclopedia of Food Science,Food Technology, and Nutrition, 1993). Teas As mentioned in the section on Herbals and Botanicals, plant materials that have been dried, cleaned, sorted, and shredded to the appropriate particle size may be sold as teas. Fine particlesare used for tea bags, and coarser particles are used for loose teas. Green teas, which are said tohave antioxidant qualities, are made from tea leaves that have been blanched or roasted to stopthe process of fermentation that produces black teas (Best, 1996). Some teas may containingredients such as flavorings or extracts in addition to shredded plant materials (LEAVES PureTeas, 1998). Bee Products Propolis, bee pollen, and royal jelly are all coproducts of honey production that are used in dietary supplements. Propolis is a sticky substance that is secreted by bees to seal cracks andspaces within the hive. Its antimicrobial properties help to control the growth of bacteria andfungus within the hive. Beekeepers can collect small quantities of propolis by hand by scraping itout of the crevices and corners of the hive. Those who collect it commercially may place a fine-2-14mesh plastic screen about an inch above the hive. In the fall, the bees attempt to seal the space between the screen and the hive with propolis. The beekeeper later removes the screen alongwith the propolis. A healthy hive can produce about 200 grams of propolis in a season. To collect pollen from bees, beekeepers construct pollen traps. These are screens that the bees must crawl through in order to enter the hive. As they crawl through the mesh, about 10 percentof the pollen that they are carrying is scraped off and falls into a clean tray below. Beekeeperscan collect 2 to 3 kg of pollen from a single hive in one season without causing a shortage for thebees. Royal jelly is a substance that bees produce in minute quantities to feed larvae that are to become queen bees. It is collected by hand with either a special spoon or a suction device. Royal jellydegrades easily and should be refrigerated in air-tight brown glass containers. Many beekeepers collect propolis, pollen, and royal jelly for their own use and do not sell it commercially. Only large beekeeping operations produce enough of these substances forcommercial marketing (Schech, 1998). 2.2 FINAL DOSAGE FORMS Although the production practices for DS products differ, the final dosage forms among them aresimilar in many cases. In this section we describe how products are put into the form in whichthey are purchased by consumers. 2.2.1 Capsule Dosage Forms Gelatin capsules were invented in the 1830s by a pharmacist who wanted to make unpalatable medicines easier to swallow. Both hard and soft capsules have similar ingredients, which includegelatin and water, and possibly colorants, preservatives, opacifying agents, flavors, andsweeteners. Soft capsules also contain plasticizers such as glycerin or sorbitol to keep thempliable. The following is a brief description of the production processes for hard and softcapsules. Hard Capsules The process for manufacturing hard capsules is highly automated. Rows of mold pins that are shaped like either the body or cap of a capsule are lowered into tanks containing a gelatinsolution. The gelatin coats the pins and hardens. After drying, the capsule bodies and caps areremoved from the pins and cut to the correct length. The caps are placed on the bodies, and theempty capsules are sealed in moisture-proof containers for shipping and storage until use(Swarbrick and Boylan, 1990). Hard gelatin capsules can be filled with many types of materials, including powders, granules, pastes, oily liquids, suspensions, and solutions. Gelatin capsules cannot be used for substances2-15that have a high water content because water will soften or dissolve the gelatin. Substances that must be consumed in large volume are not well suited for capsules either, since there is a limit tothe size of capsule that can be easily swallowed. Substances that react with gelatin, such asformaldehyde, should also be avoided (Swarbrick and Boylan, 1990). Various types of machines are used for filling hard capsules. They all automate the same basic steps. The empty shells are first all pointed in the same direction, with the bottoms pointingdown. The cap is removed from the bottom using suction. A dosing head places the correctamount of material into the capsule, and the cap is replaced. For powders and dry solids, thereare direct and indirect filling machines. Machines that use the capsule itself to measure thecorrect volume of material are known as direct filling machines. Indirect filling machines have aseparate chamber that premeasures the correct quantity to be placed in each capsule. Machinesfor filling capsules with liquids use volumetric pumps to measure the correct dose (Swarbrick andBoylan, 1990). The equipment used to make hard gelatin capsules is very costly. For this reason, these capsules are manufactured in large quantities by only a few companies (Swarbrick and Boylan, 1990). Soft Capsules Soft capsules, which are also called \"softgels,\" are one-piece, hermetically sealed, soft gelatin shells that contain a liquid or semiliquid substance. They are formed, filled and sealed in onecontinuous operation. As with hard capsules, substances that dissolve or react with the gelatinare not suitable for encapsulation in softgels. Softgels are produced as follows: Melted gelatin flows from two tanks in thin streams onto two rotating cooling drums, forming two thin ribbons of gelatin. These ribbons, which are lubricatedwith mineral oil, pass over guide rolls and are brought together through rotating die rolls. Thesedie rolls pinch the two ribbons together to form the capsule. Before the two ribbons arecompletely pinched together, a pump injects the fill material into the pocket that has been formedbetween the two ribbons. The die then seals off the pocket to form a capsule and stamps it out ofthe ribbons. The filled capsules pass through a solvent to remove the lubricant and are dried.The equipment used to produce softgels also requires a large capital investment and is generallyperformed by large manufacturers on a contract basis (Swarbrick and Boylan, 1990). 2.2.2 Tablet Dosage Forms Tablets are a solid dosage form that come in various shapes and sizes. They are formed by compression and generally contain additives to aid in their manufacture, as well as variouscolorants and coatings. The additives used to make tablets are called \"adjuncts.\" These mayinclude diluents or fillers to add bulk; binders, or adhesives to help hold tablets together;disintegrating agents to aid in the breakup of the tablet after swallowing; and lubricating agents toallow the material to flow freely through the tablet-making equipment. The machines used to2-16make tablets use punches or dies that apply tremendous pressure to powdered or granular material, compressing it into tablets. Tablets can be made through a single compression, orlayered tablets may be made using multiple compressions (Ansel, Popovich, and Allen, 1995). Once tablets are formed, they may be coated with a sugar, film, or enteric coating. Sugar coatings protect the active ingredients in the tablet from air and humidity and cover bad flavors.They also can be used to make tablets larger and easier to handle. Film-coated tablets arecovered with a thin layer of a polymer that protects the tablet and makes it easier to swallow.This film breaks apart in the stomach. Enteric coatings remain intact until the tablet reaches theintestines. Chewable tablets, which have no coating, are also made by compression. This type oftablet is commonly used for children's vitamins. They are generally made from a mannitol basewith added colors and flavors (Ansel, Popovich, and Allen, 1995). Dissolution of Capsules and Tablets Both hard and soft capsules and tablets can be tested to determine how readily they dissolve. The rate of dissolution is an important characteristic of capsules and tablets since it is indicative of thesubstance's absorption and availability within the body. A fairly simple apparatus is used tomeasure the rate of dissolution for these dosage forms. The equipment consists of a series of wellsor containers with the dissolution solvent kept at a constant temperature by a water bath. Thetablets are introduced directly into the dissolution solvent and stirred with a paddle or areintroduced in a basket attached to a shaft that is rotated. The capsules and tablets are mixed withthe dissolution solvent until the dissolution time has expired. Then the solvent is analyzed fordissolved constituents to determine the dissolution rate (Hines, 1998). 2.2.3 Liquid Dosage Forms Liquid dosage forms include solutions, syrups, and elixirs. Solutions contain active ingredients plus a solvent, which is generally water. They are prepared on an industrial scale in large,thermostatically controlled mixing vats with openings for mechanical stirrers (Ansel, Popovich,and Allen, 1995). Syrups are concentrated aqueous preparations that generally contain sugar or asugar substitute, flavorings, colorings, and preservatives, along with the active ingredient. Theymay also contain additional solvents, solubilizing agents, thickeners, or stabilizers. Most syrupscontain 60 to 80 percent sugar because of its sweetness, viscosity, and stability. Syrups can beprepared using heat to dissolve the sugar and active components or without heat, using agitationto dissolve the ingredients. Sometimes sugar syrup is prepared separately and cooled beforemixing with a fluid extract. Elixirs are similar to syrups except that they contain some alcohol andless sugar. They are useful for delivering substances that are not soluble in water alone (Ansel,Popovich, and Allen, 1995).2-172.2.4 Powder and Granule Dosage Forms Powders are fine particles of material in dry form. Powders used for medicinal purposes must be a homogeneous blend of all desired components and must be of an appropriate particle size.Various types of mills and pulverizing equipment are used to reduce particle size, andstandardized sieves are used to measure particle size. Granules are agglomerates of smallerparticles. They are made by blending a liquid with a powder, then passing the mixture through asieve to produce the desired granule size. The granules are then dried (Ansel, Popovich, andAllen, 1995). 2.2.5 Lozenge Dosage Forms Lozenges are made to dissolve slowly in the mouth for local effect. They can be made by compression with a tableting machine, or if the active ingredient is heat resistant, lozenges can beproduced with hard-candy-making equipment. The active ingredients are added to a hot,concentrated sugar syrup that is molded and cooled (Ansel, Popovich, and Allen, 1995). 2.2.6 Packaging of Dietary Supplements The purpose of packaging is to provide protection, presentation, identification, information, and convenience from the time a product is manufactured until it is consumed. The type of packagingused will depend on the characteristics of the product, such as its sensitivity to moisture, oxygen,or light or its reactivity with the packaging material. The form of the product is also important.Whether the product is a tablet, capsule, liquid, or granule will determine the appropriatepackaging. Plastic bottles and jars are commonly used to package dietary supplements. Othertypes of packaging include glass bottles, jars, vials, and ampules, as well as bags or pouchesmade of plastic film, laminates, aluminum foil, or paper. Some types of packaging, such as blisterpacks, are a combination of several materials. Packaging is sometimes performed on a contractbasis (Lockhart and Paine, 1996). 2.3 GOOD MANUFACTURING PRACTICES A draft report prepared by representatives of several trade associations for FDA in 1995 outlinesgood manufacturing practices (GMPs) for the dietary supplement industry (U.S. Dept. of Healthand Human Services, 1997). These practices are modeled after GMPs for food, not those forpharmaceuticals. The majority of the GMPs in this report are identical to those for food.However, in some instances the report provides more detailed recommendations for themanufacture of dietary supplements than for foods. For example, the section of the report onproduction and process controls contains detailed guidelines for quality control, maintenance oflaboratory records, and specification of expiration dates. It calls for manufacturers to keep masterproduction and control records, as well as individual production and control records for eachbatch produced. The report also specifies that raw materials should be examined, identified, andtested prior to use. It recommends that manufacturers establish procedures for ensuring the2-18quality and composition of the final product. Instructions on appropriate packaging and labeling are included, as are procedures for handling complaints (Council for Responsible Nutrition,1995). 2.4 PRODUCTION COSTS FOR DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS Data on production costs for DS products are not readily available from secondary data sources.However, some information can be obtained on the relative costs of labor and materials at the4-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) level from the U.S. Bureau of the Census. Table 2-3presents the number of employees, payroll expenses, costs of materials, and value of industryshipments for each of the six SIC codes that encompass the majority of the DS industry. DSproducts fall predominately in SIC 2833, Medicinal Chemicals and Botanical Products, and 2834,Pharmaceutical Preparations; however, other types of firms are also included in these SICs. 1 The percentages of payroll expenses and cost of materials relative to value of shipments arecalculated in Table 2-3 for each SIC. For most of the SIC codes, the cost of materials is half ormore of the value of shipments, and payroll expenses are much less. For SIC 2833, the cost ofmaterials made up about 48 percent of the value of shipments in 1996. For 2834, in comparison,cost of materials made up only 30 percent of the value of shipments in 1996. The percentages oflabor expenses for each were 9 percent and 10 percent, respectively, in 1996. In general, from1994 to 1996, it appears that labor expenses were falling and costs of materials were risingrelative to value of shipments. 1SIC codes are discussed in greater detail in Section 6 of this report.Table 2-3. Labor and Materials Expense for SIC Codes that Contain Dietary Supplement Products: 1994-1996 SIC Year DescriptionTotal Employees (thousands)Total Payroll Current Dollars (million $)Cost of Materials Current Dollars (million $)Value of Shipments Current Dollars (million $)Payroll as a % of Value of ShipmentsCost of Materials as a % of Value of Shipments 2099 1994 Food Preparations, NEC Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, Bureau of the Census. 1994 and 1996 Annual Surv ey of Manufactures: Statistics for Industry Groups and Industries M94(AS)-1 and M96(AS)-1. 2-193-1SECTION 3 FACILITIES AND FIRMS Currently available estimates of the number of facilities and firms that supply raw materials and manufacture DS products cover a broad range.2 The Nutrition Business Journal estimates that in 1997, 150 raw material manufacturers and over 1,000 growers and harvesters supplied rawmaterials to the industry and 1,050 manufacturers produced finished DS products (see Figure 1-1).The Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN) estimates that between 800 and 1,400 raw materialsuppliers and manufacturers serve the market. These estimates are similar to the estimate of over1,100 DS raw material and manufacturing firms that are members of the five major DS tradeorganizations. 3 This may be an overstatement to the extent that some firms belong to multiple organizations but an understatement to the extent that some firms belong to none of theorganizations. RTI compiled information on plants and firms in the DS industry in the Dietary Supplement Enhanced Establishment Database (DS-EED). To the extent that data are available, the recordscontain information such as name and location of facilities, DS product type, facility type(manufacturer, ingredient supplier, repackager/relabeler/encapsulator, importer, exporter), otherproduct types manufactured, sales, employment, SIC codes, NAICS and international codes. Thesources of this information include the following: Z American Herbal Products Association 1998-1999 Membership Directory and Resource Guide; Z Council for Responsible Nutrition 1998 Membership Directory; Z Natural Food Merchandiser's Retailer Purchasing Guide, August 1998; Z InfoSeek Company Capsules (Hoover's Corporation), downloaded February 1998; Z Natural Products Expo West, Show Directory, March 1998; Z FDA's Official Establishment Inventory; Z Harris InfoSource, Inc.'s U.S. Manufacturers Database, electronic file received February 1998; and Z Thomas Food Industry Register on the Internet, downloaded January-February 1999. After deleting duplicate records from these sources, 2,026 facilities remained in the DS-EED. Of these 2,026 facilities, 1,978 are located in the United States, 42 are located in Canada, and 6 arelocated in Puerto Rico. 2In this section, the term facility is synonymous with establishment or plant and the term firm is synonymous with company . Firms may own a single facility or multiple facilities. 3Based on its interviews with the major trade organizations, RTI learned that the Council for Responsible Nutrition has 94 members; American Herbal Productions Association has approximately 200 members; the Nonprescription DrugManufacturers Association has 15 members who produce DS products; the Utah Natural Products Alliance has 8members; and the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA) has 800 raw material and manufacturing firmmembers. NNFA's numbers include some firms that produce natural products other than dietary supplements.3-2In Section 3.1, we describe the characteristics of the facilities in the DS-EED. In Section 3.2, we describe financial data for the DS industry. 3.1 FACILITY CHARACTERISTICS The facilities in the DS-EED are characterized by facility type, product type, and other productsproduced. Each of these characteristics is described below. The facility type indicates whether a facility manufactures, distributes, imports, exports, repackages, relabels, or encapsulates DS products or whether a facility provides raw ingredientsto the industry. Table 3-1 provides frequencies for each facility type. Because a facility may beinvolved in more than one activity, the frequencies add up to greater than the total number offacilities in the database. Table 3-1. DS Facility Type Frequencies Facility Type Number of Facilities Percentage of Facilities Manufacturer 1,555 78.6% Input supplier 316 16.0% Source: Dietary Supplement Enhanced Establishment Database (DS-EED), as obtained March 24, 1999. More than 78 percent of the facilities in the DS-EED are manufacturers of DS products. Sixteen percent of the facilities provide raw ingredients; 17 percent repack, relabel, or encapsulateproducts; and 13 percent distribute products. More plants export products (17 percent) versusimport products (11 percent). The product type indicates the type of DS produced or handled by each facility. Table 3-2 provides frequencies for each facility type. Vitamins and minerals, which are grouped togetherbecause facilities nearly always produce both in combination, are produced or handled by morethan half (54 percent) of the facilities. Facilities that produce or handle herbals and botanicalsfollow at 43 percent. Herbal and botanical extracts, which are a subset of herbals and botanicals,are produced or handled by 14 percent of facilities. Teas follow at 10 percent, amino acids at9 percent, proteins at 4 percent, and animal extracts at 2 percent. Concentrates, metabolites, andconstituents are produced or handled at 4 percent of plants, but this figure may not represent thetrue total because the industry directories used to compile the DS-EED did not provide sufficient3-3Table 3-2. DS Product Type Frequencies Product Type Number of FacilitiesaPercentage of Facilities Vitamins and Minerals 1,066 53.9% Herbals and Botanicals 850 43.0% Herbal and Botanical Extracts 273 13.8%Animal Extracts 34 1.7%Amino Acids 186 9.4%Proteins 87 4.4%Tea 200 Metabolites, and Constituents 80 4.0%Other Supplements 602 30.4% aThe record source for 372 facilities did not indicate any product types. Source: Dietary Supplement Enhanced Establishment Database (DS-EED), as obtained March 24, 1999. detail to identify these products. Similarly, nearly 19 percent of facility records indicate no product types, which is also due to insufficient detail in the industry directories. Table 3-3 furtherbreaks out product type by facility type for comparison across facility types. Other products produced indicates whether a facility produces foods and/or drugs in addition to dietary supplements. Table 3-4 provides frequencies of facilities producing each of these otherproduct types. Approximately 21 percent of facilities also produce foods and 17 percent alsoproduce drugs. 3.2 DS FINANCIAL DATA Future versions of the DS-EED will likely contain more information on sales and employment atindividual facilities than is available from industry directories. Once this information becomesavailable, it will be possible to characterize DS facilities based on sales volumes andemployment. In addition, parent company information can be used to categorize DS companiesas small or large. The U.S. Small Business Administration (1997) size definitions for the most relevant SIC codes are the following: Z 2075 Soybean Oil Mills: < 500 employees Z 2099 Food Preparations, Not Elsewhere Classified: < 500 employees Z 2819 Industrial Organic Chemicals, Not Elsewhere Classified: < 1,000 employees Z 2833 Medicinal Chemicals and Botanical Products: < 750 employees3-4Table 3-3.

These sales data include only supplements rather than sales of all products produced by each company.Table 3-5 lists supplement sales for the top 15 manufacturers.

September 1998. \"$23 Billion and Counting: Nutrition Industry Braces for a Competitive Future.\" 3(9):1-5, 13, 18.4-1SECTION 4 DEMAND FOR DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS Consumers use DS products for a wide variety of reasons. Some products are taken because they are essential nutrients (e.g., vitamins and minerals at recommended dosages). Others are takenbecause they are expected to have some pharmacological effect (e.g., herbals and botanicals). Inthis section, we identify the uses of major DS products, describe the consumers of DS, anddescribe substitution possibilities. 4.1 DS PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS AND USES DS products are desired by consumers based on, among other things, the actual, perceived, orsuggested health benefits that they yield to consumers. Consumers learn of the beneficial effectsof DS products from Z product labels, Z merchandise catalogs, Z media advertisements (radio, newspaper, magazines, television), Z the Internet, Z product literature, Z books and pamphlets, and Z physicians and other practitioners (e.g., chiropractors). The claims made by DS manufacturers and retailers are regulated by DSHEA. They are allowed to make structure/function claims that describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient inaffecting part of the structure or a function of the human body or that describe the way a nutrientor dietary ingredient acts to maintain body function and structure. In order to make these claims,DS retailers must back their claims with sufficient data (substantiation) and must also place on theproduct a disclaimer stating that the \"product is not intended to diagnose, cure, treat, or prevent adisease\" (Raubucheck, 1997). Some health claims that have been approved for use on conventional food products can be used on DS products as well. These include claims linking Z calcium and osteoporosis, Z folate and neural tube defects, Z soluble fiber from whole oats and coronary heart disease, Z soluble fiber from psyllium husks and coronary heart disease, and Z sugar alcohols and dental caries [cavities]. (see Table 2 in Commission of Dietary Supplement Labels, 1997).4-2This section provides information on the perceived or actual health benefits of dietary supplements in the following categories: vitamins, minerals, herbal and botanicals, amino acids,proteins, and animal extracts. Within each category, commonly purchased products are detailedas to the perceived or actual health benefits consumers receive by ingesting them, some commonclaims that are made, and any scientific evidence backing the validity of these claims.Metabolites, constituents, and concentrates and other supplement products not elsewhereclassified are discussed at the end of this section. 4.1.1 Vitamins Vitamins are essential for normal health, metabolism, growth, and the proper functioning of cells. Vitamins are divided into two categories: fat-soluble, which can be stored in the body, andwater-soluble, which are not stored in significant quantities in the body. Vitamins must beobtained from the diet because they are either not synthesized in the human body or are notsynthesized in large enough amounts. Table 4-1 lists 13 vitamins and their health benefits andwhether or not a particular vitamin is toxic or has a deficiency disease associated with it. Vitamin supplements may be purchased as single vitamin products, multivitamin preparations, or combined with other DS products (e.g., some St. John's wort products contain B-complexvitamins). Dietary supplement product vitamin preparations come in many forms, includingcapsules, tablets, sprays, liquids, candies and lozenges, and chewable tablets (Hendler, 1990). 4.1.2 Minerals Minerals are chemical elements required by our bodies for numerous biological and physiological processes that are necessary for the maintenance of health. Like vitamins, minerals are alsodivided into two categories. Those that are required in our diets in amounts greater than 100milligrams per day are called \"minerals\" and those that are required in amounts less than 100milligrams per day are \"trace elements.\" Minerals include compounds of the elements calcium,magnesium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, sulfur, and chlorine. Trace elements that arenecessary for human health include iron, iodine, copper, manganese, zinc, molybdenum,selenium, and chromium (Hendler, 1990). Table 4-2 describes the role of minerals and traceelements in the body and lists claims made for particular minerals, any scientific evidence thatexists to support these claims, and deficiency symptoms and toxicity. Some minerals that mayhave positive effects on human health are also included in the table. Sulfur, chlorine, andsodium, which are sometime included in DS products, are not included in the table because theyare found in food via the soil it is grown in, in our water supply, and in the case of sodium, innumerous food products. Minerals are prepared in a variety of forms including, but not limitedto, tablets, capsules, multivitamin-multimineral preparations, and liquids (Hendler, 1990).4-3Table 4-1.

They are both becoming increasingly valued by someconsumers for their perceived medicinal properties; however, FDA regulations prevent statementsthat these products are intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease. In addition to themore familiar herbs, Chinese traditional herbs and Ayurvedic (traditional Indian) medicinal herbsare becoming available in the United States. An estimated 2,500 herbs have been used formedicinal purposes at one time or another throughout history (Griffith, 1988). Table 4-3 listssome of the common conditions and symptoms and the herbal products that are used to treatthem. The active ingredients within herbal products vary depending on the plants' growingconditions and degree of maturity when harvested as well as the drying process used and the typeand duration of storage. Herbals and botanicals are available in many forms including teas,powders, tinctures, extracts, and liquids (Hendler, 1990). 4 4.1.4 Amino Acids Amino acids are compounds that include an amino group (NH 2) and an acidic function. Twenty amino acids are the chief components of proteins and are the building blocks of all livingstructures. They are divided into two categories: essential and nonessential. Table 4-4 lists theessential amino acids, which are not synthesized in the body, and the nonessential amino acids,which are. 5 Children require the eight essential amino acids plus histidine and arginine for physical well-being. Essential amino acids must be obtained from the diet while the nonessentialamino acids can be made by the body from other substances. There are other amino acids whichare found in the human body but are not involved in the synthesis of proteins. Table 4-4 includestwo of these, ornithine and taurine. Amino acids come in a variety of forms such as tablets,capsules, powders for oral solution, and as a constituent of multivitamin/mineral preparations.Injectable forms are also available but must be administered by a doctor (Griffith, 1988; Hendler,1990; HealthWorld Online, 1998a). 4.1.5 Proteins In the human body, proteins are antibodies as part of the immune system; an energy source; important in fetal formation, during pregnancy and in children's growth; essential in thereplacement of all the body's cells; involved in maintaining the proper sodium, water andpotassium balance inside cells which enables the heart, lungs, and nervous system to functionproperly; and important in regulating blood pH. There are specific dietary requirements forproteins although the exact amounts are not known. The Recommended Daily Allowance is 0.8grams per kilogram of ideal body weight for the adult. Protein deficiency is not common in theWestern world, but it does occur in Third World countries. 4Although DS products can be prepared as teas, not all teas are DS products. Teas have a Standard of Identity (SOI) as a food product and are considered as such unless the manufacturer labels them as dietary supplements. 5Information on benefits and claims not listed in Table 4-4 was not readily available from secondary sources.4-15Table 4-3.

As obtained on March 19, 1998.4-23Proteins are taken as DS products because they are believed to aid in the maintenance of a positive nitrogen balance in muscles, post-exercise recovery, building of muscles, and to increaseenergy. Proteins do not have specific medical or biological names; therefore they are marketedsimply as \"protein\" supplements and the name attached to the label is the company's choice.They come in a variety of forms from powdered drink mixes and energizing shakes to capsulesand tablets (HealthWorld Online, 1998c). 4.1.6 Animal Extracts Animal extracts are the tissue extracts from animals of specific tissues or glands. The term glandulars refers to the concentrated extracts of various animal glands. These products can be found as tablets, powders, capsules, as constituents of multivitamin/mineral preparations and oils.The following are commonly found animal extract and glandular supplement products (110%Products, 1998; Sequential Healing sulfate (from cartilage of most mammals)Pituitary Shark cartilage Companies are marketing glandular products with claims that they revive and rejuvenate glands that are not functioning as well as they once were due to the aging process. In other words,glandular products are claimed to restore health and function to the tissue that is targeted (e.g.,consumers' adrenal glands will work better if they take adrenal extracts). Glandulars are claimedto be effective in treating cancer and hypoglycemia, in lowering cholesterol, boosting sex driveand building muscle, and preventing and reversing aging. There is no legitimate scientificevidence that any of these claims are valid, and glandulars can be dangerous due to the fact thatsome of the organ concentrates may contain chemicals that livestock come in contact with, suchas antibiotics, growth hormones, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers. 4.1.7 Metabolites, Constituents, and Concentrates As mentioned in Section 2, these are alternative forms of products classified in the other categories. Thus they are not specifically addressed here.4-244.1.8 Other Supplement Products Not Elsewhere Classified A variety of other products are marketed as DS products and claim to have numerous beneficial impacts on human health and physical well-being.6 They may be available as capsules, liquids, tablets, powders, and as constituents of multivitamin/mineral preparations. A few of the morewidely available products are described below (HealthWorld Online, 1998d). Z Acidophilus \u2014bacterium found in yogurt and other products. It helps maintain bacteria balance in the lower intestines. Z Algae \u2014green or blue-green freshwater, one-celled organisms. The three main algae products are chlorella, spirulina, and blue-green manna. All these products are high inprotein and contain large amounts of vitamins and minerals. Blue-green algae productscontain all the amino acids and are marketed as body rejuvenators, which improve energylevels, decrease appetite, and increase mental energy. These products are commonlyused for weight loss and fasting and are sold in powdered or tablet form. Z Bee pollen \u2014microscopic male seed of flowering plants. No beneficial effects have been proven. Z Bioflavinoids \u2014chemical constituent of pulp and rind of citrus fruits, green pepper, apricots, cherries, grapes, papaya, tomatoes, and broccoli. Intake of these treats a rarebioflavinoid deficiency and prevents vitamin C and adrenalin from being oxidized. Z Brewer's yeast \u2014supplies B vitamins, proteins, and minerals and is a good source of enzyme-producing vitamins. It helps regulate sugar metabolism via the chromium itcontains and provides bulk to prevent constipation. Z Coenzyme Q \u2014part of mitochondria of cells. It is found in beef, sardines, spinach, and peanuts and helps control the flow of oxygen within individual cells. Z Dietary fiber \u2014makes up cell walls of plants. Because it passes through the digestive tract without being absorbed, it lessens the chances of constipation, helps to control blood-sugar levels in diabetics, and helps reduce cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood. Z Gamma-linolenic acid\u2014 an oil found in evening primrose plant (see and Botanicals). Z Inositol \u2014(also called myo-inositol) made synthetically and found in beans, nuts, oats, pork, rice, veal, wheat germ, whole-grain products, cantaloupe, calves' liver, citrus fruits,chickpeas, lentils, and lecithin. It helps move fats out of the liver. Z Lecithin \u2014made synthetically and also found in all animal and plant products and in cabbage, eggs, green beans, lentils, rice, and split peas, among other natural sources. Itprotects cells from damage by oxidation, is a major source of choline, and is found inchemicals that aid the passage of nutrients into cells from the bloodstream. Z Nucleic acids \u2014large molecules that are encoded with genetic instructions and are part of each living cell. Nucleic acids taken orally are not effective and have no impact, as theyare changed or destroyed in the intestinal tract before they can be absorbed. There is nodeficiency for nucleic acids, and the oral tablet and capsule forms are nontoxic (Griffith,1988; HealthWorld Online, 1998d). Z Royal jelly \u2014substance secreted by salivary glands of worker bees. It has no known effects in the human body. 6These claims have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. DS products may not include statements that they diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease.4-25Z Spirulina \u2014(Spirulina geitler, S. maxima, S. platenis ) algae. It has no known or proven effects. Z Superoxide dismutase \u2014enzyme associated with copper, zinc, and manganese. The oral forms have no effect, as they are destroyed in the intestines before being absorbed. 4.2 CONSUMERS OF DS PRODUCTS To construct a demand curve for a DS product, one would include characteristics of the population that consumes the product. These demographic characteristics (e.g., income, gender,age) are the factors that shift the demand curve for a particular product. However, information onthe demographic characteristics of DS users is scarce. Most of the large-scale studies on DS usewere conducted several years ago and did not contain information on nontraditional DS products(i.e., products other than vitamins and minerals). However, a new survey of 43,000 householdsthat was conducted by Hartman and New Hope includes information on the use of nontraditionalDS products (Wingate, 1998). In general, studies indicate that gender, age, race, income, educational level, and body weight are related strongly to DS use. Most studies found that whites, women, individuals over 30, andindividuals living in the western United States are more likely to consume DS products. Onestudy also found that other health habits and occupation are also strongly related to DS use. Incomparison, studies that considered smoking and tobacco use, alcohol use, exercise level, andmarital status found no correlation with DS use. In this section, we summarize the large-scale studies and briefly describe some of the small-scale studies that have been conducted on DS use. 4.2.1 Major Studies of DS Use Stewart et al. (1985): This survey assessed vitamin and mineral supplement usage via a national telephone interview survey of an age-stratified random sample of 2,991 people age 16 and over.This survey revealed that, excluding pregnant or lactating women, 39.9 percent of the populationconsumed one or more supplements daily. Of these, 52.4 percent consumed only onesupplement and 10.9 percent consumed five or more supplements daily. The most any personconsumed was 14 products daily. However, the percentage of people taking at least onesupplement in the past year declined from 51.1 percent in 1987 to 46.2 percent in 1992. Use ofsupplements by women was greater than used by men for each age group (16 to 24, 25 to 64,65+). Women ages 25 to 64 had the highest supplement usage (46.8 percent), and men ages 25to 64 had the lowest usage (33.3 percent). The most widely used supplements were singlevitamin/miscellaneous supplements, with vitamin/mineral combinations as the second mostcommon and multivitamin/minerals as the third most common supplement product consumed.Use was more common in the West census region than in the rest of the country. Those withhigher incomes and those who had at least finished high school were more likely to usesupplements than those who had lower incomes and those who had not finished high school.4-26Block et al. (1988): The data used for this assessment came from the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1971-1974, in which 21,000 people were sampled. Because theinformation is outdated, we give just a brief overview of the data. This paper presented detailedinformation on the use of nine specific vitamins and minerals for a broad range of behavioral anddemographic characteristics. More women were found to consume supplements than men, at26.1 percent vs. 19.4 percent. Consumption of supplements was much more common for whites,with 24.1 percent using supplements, than for blacks, with 11.7 percent using supplements.Overall, those older than 65 consumed the most supplements. Consumption was found to behighest in the West and lowest in the South. Educational level was found to correlate withsupplement consumption, although no significant correlation could be found between incomeand usage. Body weight, however, was found to have a significant negative relation to use ofvitamin and mineral supplements. Moss et al. (1989): This study provides estimates from the National Center for Health Statistics' 1986 survey of adults and young children who use nonprescription vitamin and mineral products.A vitamin and mineral user was defined as anyone who had taken a nonprescription vitamin,mineral, or fluoride product in the 2-week period before the interview was conducted. Thisreport estimated that 36 percent of all adults took vitamin and mineral supplements in 1986 andthat women were more likely than men to consume supplements (41 percent to 31 percent). Anestimated 40 percent of whites used supplements versus 20 percent of blacks. This racialdifference was found in both sexes and among all age groups. This study estimated that29 percent of Hispanic adults take supplements. Both family income and educational level werefound to be directly related to supplement usage. Those in the West were found to be more likelyto consume supplements, as were those who live in a metropolitan statistical area. Most peopletake just one supplement, and it is a multivitamin, according to this report. For those over 45, thepercentage of adults using two products or more (45 percent) was higher than for those under 45(36 percent). More women than men used more than one vitamin and mineral product.Differences in the types of products taken were also reported, with only 16 percent of adults whotook any vitamin product taking a single vitamin product, and 86 percent of adults whopurportedly took three products or more taking a single vitamin product. The paper also indicatesthat supplement use is frequent, with 70 percent of all adults and children who use supplementstaking them every day. Slesinski, Subar, and Kahle (1995): This study detailed the trends in the use of vitamin and mineral supplements in the United States. Information is based on the 1987 and 1992 NationalHealth Interview Surveys, making this paper relatively current. This study found that multivitaminuse increased from 17.4 percent to 19.3 percent from 1987 to 1992. In general, more womenthan men took supplements, and far more whites than either blacks or Hispanics consumedsupplements, although the percentage of blacks taking supplements increased 2 percent whilewhite and Hispanic use increased by only 0.3 percent and 0.1 percent, respectively. Also, thosewith higher incomes and educational levels were more likely to consume supplements in both4-271987 and 1992. Those age 55 and older had the highest percentage of supplement consumption in both 1987 and 1992. Overall, supplement usage did not change much between 1987 and1992. Subar and Block (1990): This study used data from the 1987 National Health Interview Survey which was collected from 22,080 adults age 18 to 99. Only 23.2 percent of the adultsinterviewed used DS products daily, although 51.1 percent said they had used a supplementwithin the year before the interview. Whites, women, and older people were found to be muchmore likely to consume supplements on a regular basis than blacks, men, and younger adults.Multivitamins were the most common supplements consumed, followed by vitamin C, calcium,and vitamins E and A. Daily usage was highest among both men and women in the 55 to 64 agerange (32.2 percent) and declined slightly with age. White women age 55 to 64 had the highestpercentage consuming supplements (39.9 percent); this number declined slightly with age.Within other sex-race categories, use increased with age. Whites consumed the mostsupplements within age-sex categories, followed by Hispanics and then blacks. This study also looked at other demographic and behavioral characteristics. Those completing high school and college were significantly more likely to consume supplements than those whodid not finish high school. Supplement use was also shown to increase with income. As in otherstudies, consumption was highest in the West and lowest in the South. Individuals with thehighest body mass index were the least likely to take supplements. Former smokers were theheaviest supplement users, followed closely by those who never smoked. People in the highestalcohol consumption category used supplements the least, although use of supplements wasrelatively similar for all other drinking categories. Those who believe that diet affects diseaseprevention were found to be significantly more likely to consume supplements than those whodid not believe there was a link between diet and disease prevention. This study included avariable not found in the other major studies\u2014occupation category. The category with thehighest daily supplement use (27.5 percent) was \"not in the labor force,\" which includes womenworking in the home and retired persons. Close behind are white-collar workers, 24.6 percent ofwhom use supplements regularly. The highest rates among white-collar workers were for seniorexecutives and those with a professional specialty. Less than 20 percent of blue-collar workersand those in the military regularly use supplements. Wingate (1998): This study, conducted in December 1997, is the most recent large-scale survey undertaken. A sample of 43,000 households with a member who had used vitamins, minerals, orherbal supplements in the past 6 months was asked about usage of 97 different vitamin, mineral,herbal, and other supplement products. This survey was unique in that it addressed the use ofsupplement products not typically asked about in other surveys, like herbs and amino acids. Overall, 68 percent of the 43,000 households responding to the survey reported that they had used vitamins, minerals, or herbal supplements in the past 6 months. The study found thatwomen age 21 to 40 are the most educated consumers, while those over 50 tend to use more4-28products and use them more frequently than younger consumers. Almost half the people using saw palmetto and glucosamine sulfate are over age 60. Pygeum, chondroitin sulfate, and bilberryare also popular among those over age 60. The largest percentage of households with a memberwho used a vitamin, mineral, or herbal product (30 percent) was in the 60+ age group. The40-49 age group followed, with 22 percent, and the 30-39 group, 21 percent. Geographic region and specific product purchases were also addressed. The highest concentration of garlic and ginseng users/buyers was in the southern Atlantic states, followed bythe Pacific states. Eighteen percent of households had a member who had used a supplement inthe past 6 months in the southern Atlantic states, followed by 16 percent in the central Northeastand 15 percent each in the Pacific and mid-Atlantic regions, the survey found. Garlic was usedby 19 percent of those surveyed, followed by ginseng (10 percent), ginkgo (9 percent), echinacea(7 percent), and antioxidants (7 percent). The survey found that 32 percent buy their supplementsat a pharmacy or drug store, 23 percent purchase them at a supermarket, 17 percent buy themfrom network marketing and 11 percent buy them at health food stores. 4.2.2 Smaller Studies Thomsen, Terry, and Amos (1987): A study of 163 adolescent students in a rural Iowa town found that 16 percent took a supplement daily and that 64 percent had taken one during the pastmonth. The teens' use of supplements was correlated with their parents' use of supplements. Zive et al. (1996): Young adults were the focus of another survey that used 24-hour diet recalls from 1988 to 1991 on a sample of 504 19- to 28-year-olds in Bogalusa, Louisiana. Nine and one-half percent of the participants reported taking a DS product in the prior 24-hour period. About11 percent said they took supplements daily, 17 percent said they took them \"once in a while,\"and 72 percent said they had never taken a DS product. Medeiros et al. (1991): People in seven western states were surveyed in the spring of 1986, and by telephone in the winter of 1986/1987 and again, in the fall of 1987. Forty percent usedsupplements at the baseline and in both telephone surveys. Those who used supplements long-term (in all three surveys) did not differ from nonusers by income or educational level, but theydid have a slightly higher mean age. Women represented 55 percent of long-term users, and60 percent of the nonusers were men. Eliason et al. (1997): This survey of 136 patrons of two health food stores had findings contrary to the major studies and to some of the smaller studies as well. Respondents took an average of5.9 supplements a day. Patrons took a total of 805 supplements, 50 of which had reportedtoxicities. Herbal products were the most commonly used supplements, followed bymultivitamins. The most popular herbal products were garlic, ginseng, ginkgo biloba, eveningprimrose oil, alfalfa, and echinacea. Like the other studies, the typical supplement user was awhite, middle-aged woman with an education beyond high school.4-29Eliason et al. (1996): Two hundred consecutive patients over age 18 attending a family medical practice were surveyed. Of these, 53 percent reported taking supplements. This study reportedhigher usage of more than one supplement product than other studies had (18 percent took 2 to 5supplements). Their average estimated expenditure was $6.60 per month, and 84 percent of theproducts they purchased were vitamins and minerals, 8 percent herbals, and 3 percent aminoacid and protein supplements. No tissue or organ extracts were taken. Only educational levelwas found to correlate significantly with supplement use. Oakland and Thomsen (1990): The use of supplements by the elderly was investigated in this 1990 study of 24 males and 78 females in seven Iowa counties. Forty-nine percent had usedvitamin and mineral supplements within the last 6 months. According to this study, 25 percent ofmen and 27 percent of women regularly used supplements. Merkel, Crockett, and Mullis (1990): In another study, 340 surveys were collected from randomly selected women age 26 to 51 with school-age children. Fifty-two percent of thewomen reported using DS products. Only 11 percent said they had never used a DS product.Over two-thirds of the supplement users took only one or two products, and only 7 percentregularly used more than six supplements. Multivitamins (78 percent), followed by calcium andvitamin C, were the most commonly consumed supplements. Applied Biometrics (1996): According to information provided by Applied Biometrics in a 1996 presentation to the Food and Drug Law Institute, 67 percent of supplement users do not have anychildren under age 18 living with them and 7 out of 10 have had some college education. Fifty-one percent of supplement users have incomes between $20,000 and $50,000, according toApplied Biometrics, and 19 percent have incomes greater than $50,000. The majority exercise atleast three times a week and 23 percent exercise daily. Eighty percent do not smoke and60 percent drink only occasionally. Applied Biometrics also notes that 30 percent of all womenand 23 percent of the total take only one supplement, most likely a multivitamin. Only about11 percent of women and 12 percent of men take two supplements. 4.3 SUBSTITUTION POSSIBILITIES FOR DS PRODUCTS In addition to the demographic characteristics described in Section 4.2, the price of substituteproducts shifts the demand curve for DS products as well. If products can substitute for oneanother, then an increase in the price of one product will increase the demand for its substitutes.However, DS products are so heterogeneous that either (1) no substitutes will exist or (2) ifsubstitutes do exist, consumers will have strong preferences for one product over another. Forexample, zinc, echinacea, and vitamin C are all consumed because individuals believe they willprevent colds, but they are dissimilar enough that even large price changes in one will probablyhave little effect on the demand for the others. In other words, the cross-price elasticity ofdemand is small.4-30For traditional vitamin and mineral products, an obvious source of substitution is food products that contain the vitamin or mineral. Consumers could obtain adequate amounts through the diet.However, nontraditional DS products are taken for reasons other than nutritionalsupplementation. For these products, the substitute product may be conventional medical care.In the section below, we review some of the information that is available on both forms ofsubstitution for DS products. 4.3.1 DS Products as Substitutes for Nutrients in Conventional and Fortified Foods Dietary supplements are imperfect substitutes for both conventional foods and fortified foods. While consumers can get all the nutrients they require from foods, the opposite is not true\u2014theycannot get all the nutrients they require from supplements. At most, dietary supplements canreplace a small portion of the diet. Substitution possibilities for both conventional and fortifiedfoods are described briefly below. Conventional Foods Some consumers of DS products, particularly vitamins and minerals, may be using them as substitutes for the nutrients available in foods. For example, consumers who wish to increasetheir intake of calcium may prefer to take a calcium pill rather than eat more dairy products. Or,an individual may prefer taking an iron supplement to eating red meat. If the price of thesupplement were to increase, it is possible that some consumers would respond by taking less ofthe supplement and eating more of the foods that are rich in that nutrient. Conversely, anincrease in the price of the nutrient rich-food could cause some consumers to rely more heavilyon supplements. Price may be a very small factor in determining the consumer's choice,however. Many consumers have compelling reasons for avoiding certain foods. Individuals withlactose intolerance would not eat more dairy products as a source of calcium, nor wouldvegetarians eat red meat as a source of iron. Consumers' strong preferences regarding food limitthe extent to which supplements and food can act as substitutes for each other. Fortified Foods In some cases, fortified foods and DS products may act as substitutes for each other. For example, an individual may choose a breakfast cereal that contains 100 percent of the RDAs for vitaminsinstead of taking a daily vitamin supplement. The same manufacturers who produce vitamins forthe dietary supplement industry also supply the food industry. Major manufacturers includingHoffmann LaRoche, BASF, Rhone-Poulenc, and ADM produce vitamins for the food industry aswell as the DS and animal feed industries. In terms of value, the food industry accounts for about20 percent of vitamins consumed, compared to 30 percent used in supplements and 50 percentused in animal feeds worldwide (Ullman's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 1996). Ifconsumers switch from a fortified food to a supplement, or vice versa, they may still be4-31consuming vitamins from the same manufacturer that have been prepared and packaged in a different form. Although the demand for vitamins from the manufacturer might remainunchanged, such a shift would affect businesses involved in the later stages of processing,packaging, or marketing either fortified foods or DS products. 4.3.2 DS Products as Substitutes for Conventional Medical Care Alternative medicine has become mainstream in its popularity as Americans increasingly turn to self-medication for treatment and prevention of disease. In 1996, $94 million was spent in theUnited States for books on herbs and related topics (Cuthbert, 1998). Unconventional medicine issometimes more accessible than traditional medicine to health care consumers, and a largesegment of the population is disgruntled with traditional medicine. Thus, some consumers aretaking a more proactive role in their health care and are looking to prevent illness to avoid theneed to see a doctor. Studies also show that consumers substitute herbal remedies andsupplements for traditional medical intervention. However, only a very small percentage ofconsumers rely completely on unconventional therapies. Most people who use alternativemedicine do so in conjunction with traditional medicine and generally use alternative therapiesfor long-term, chronic conditions; for secondary health problems; or for general well-being anddisease prevention. Most of those faced with serious conditions requiring medical treatment stillconsult a medical physician rather than pursuing unconventional therapies (Taylor, 1997). In a survey of 1,539 adults nationwide, one-third of respondents reported using at least 1 of 16 possible unconventional therapies, defined as medical interventions not taught widely in U.S.medical schools nor generally available in U.S. hospitals and including herbal medicine andmegavitamin therapy. Rates of use of unconventional therapies ranged from 23 to 53 percent,and use was more common among those 25- to 49-years-old, white, with some collegeeducation, and who lived in the West and had an annual income above $35,000 (Eisenberg et al.,1993). Comprehensive Therapy also reports that one in three Americans uses an unconventional therapy at some time (Taylor, 1997). The majority of those using nontraditional therapies to treat their principal medical problem use them to treat chronic medical conditions. In particular, patients with cancer, arthritis, chronicback pain, AIDS, chronic renal failure, eating disorders, and gastrointestinal problems frequentlyuse unconventional therapies. Of these conditions, megavitamin therapy is most commonly usedbecause individuals believe it will treat digestive difficulties. Those using megavitamin therapy totreat their ailments reported out-of-pocket expenditures averaging $203 per person per year(Eisenberg et al., 1993). Women are also using alternative medicine as a substitute for hormone replacement therapy after menopause. Supplements containing calcium, magnesium, boron, DHEA (a hormonalsupplement), and phytoestrogens, or naturally occurring plant sterols that may exhibit effectssimilar to estrogen are taken to mimic the effects of estrogen therapy in mitigating the symptoms4-32of menopause as well as to provide benefits beyond the treatment of menopausal symptoms (stronger bones, lower cardiovascular disease and cancer risk). Botanicals commonly used inmenopause treatment are angelica, black cohosh, chamomile, damiana, evening primrose,ginseng, saw palmetto, and licorice. Women are choosing such natural alternatives because theybelieve they will avoid the possible side effects of synthetic estrogen replacement therapy, such asbreast cancer, weight gain, and breakthrough bleeding. Supplementation and herbal healing are also being considered by some insurance companies and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) as possible avenues by which to offset some of theskyrocketing costs of medical care by substituting some traditional care with less costlyunconventional therapies. Oxford Health Plans Inc. became the first network provider foralternative medicine, according to Nutrition Business Journal (Nutrition Business International, October 1996a). Oxford plans to establish a network of 1,000 holistic providers, includealternative medicine coverage, and establish a mail order service for purchasing vitamins,remedies and alternative medicine products (Nutrition Business International, October 1996a).Indeed, Eisenberg's study does touch on the growing interest in insurance providers in this area;83 percent of those using the services of herbal therapists were reimbursed by third parties, aswere 30 percent of those using megavitamin therapies. Also, 70 percent of respondents in asurvey of HMOs reported an increase in the number of members asking for the provision ofalternative care therapies (Nutrition Business International, October 1996a). However, Eisenberg's study found that serious, life-threatening medical conditions are still generally treated by conventional doctors. Among people who did use an alternative therapy totreat a serious medical problem, 83 percent also sought treatment from a medical doctor for thatcondition. Of the 1,279 respondents reporting at least one principal medical condition, only3 percent saw an unconventional provider and not a medical doctor. Seven percent saw both amedical doctor and a provider, and 58 percent saw just a traditional medical doctor. Thesenumbers illustrate the rarity of visits to unconventional providers in the absence of a consultationwith a medical doctor (Eisenberg et al., 1993). A study conducted by the Medical College of Wisconsin of customers of two health food stores supports the Eisenberg study regarding use of unconventional therapies for overall wellness anddisease prevention and not as the preferred method of medical care. Of the 805 differentsupplements taken by the 136 persons surveyed, 84.3 percent were taken to prevent disease andhealth problems, and only 15.7 percent of those surveyed took supplements to treat healthproblems. Both studies found the use of unconventional therapy was not supervised by aphysician the majority of the time these therapies were used. As in the Eisenberg study, mostusers of these unconventional therapies did have health insurance and had a regular physician(Eliason et al., 1997). The use of unconventional therapies is also reflected in developments in alternative health law. In 1996 alone, Utah, Maine, and Vermont licensed all their naturopaths; Washington State's King4-33County established a natural health clinic; University of California at San Francisco created an Integrative Medicine Program and more than 30 other medical schools planned courses inalternative medicine; and medical freedom bills were active in 12 states (Nutrition BusinessInternational, January/February 1997).5-1SECTION 5 DIETARY SUPPLEMENT MARKETS, DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, AND INDUSTRY STRUCTURE Estimates of retail sales of DS products vary widely from Frost & Sullivan's 1997 estimate of $5.8 billion to F-D-C Reports, Inc.'s 1996 estimate of $10.3 billion. However, most sources agreethat the industry has grown rapidly and will continue to do so in the near future. In addition, thedistribution channels for these products are changing as grocery stores, drugstores, and massmarketers are increasing the range of DS products they carry. Because consumer demand hasincreased greatly, larger pharmaceutical companies are entering the market, often by buyingsupplement firms (Stewart, 1998). As a result, the structure of the market is changing and willcontinue to change as the DS market matures. In this section, we first provide information on the size of vitamin, mineral, and herbal and botanical markets as reported in secondary sources. We then describe the marketing of DSproducts by the following outlets: supermarkets, drugstores, mass merchandisers, natural foodstores, mail order and Internet, health care practitioners, and specialty shops. Finally, wedescribe the structure of the industry including market concentration and vertical and horizontalintegration. 5.1 SALES OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENT PRODUCTS Growth of DS product sales has been fueled in particular by increases in sales of herbal andbotanical products and mineral products. However, vitamins are still the largest component ofDS product sales. Table 5-1 breaks out sales of DS products by category, as reported in the F-D-CTan Sheet (F-D-C Reports, 1997b). Vitamins account for 48 percent of sales, minerals for6 percent, and herbals and botanicals for 28 percent, with sports nutrition (much of which isdietary supplements), meal supplements, and specialty supplements making up the remainder. Asindicated in Table 5-2, the leading brands of DS products in 1994 (the most recent year available)were Centrum (9 percent market share), Nature Made (8.7 percent), and Your Life (8.4 percent).However, nearly a third of sales are private label brands. In the following sections we describesales of the major DS product categories. 5.1.1 Vitamin Supplement Sales Vitamins are the largest supplement category, with $4.9 billion in sales in 1996 and 48 percent of the supplement market (see Table 5-1). Since vitamins are the most mature supplement category,they experienced growth of about 8 percent from 1995 to 1996, which is slower than the otherDS products (Nutrition Business International, September 1997b). Multivitamin preparationscontinue to make up the majority of vitamin sales. Among single-category vitamins, vitamins E,D, B 6, and folic acid led sales growth in 1996.5-2Table 5-1.

Values for other products and total are inferred.5-35.1.2 Mineral Supplement Sales Minerals experienced the second largest growth in sales in the DS category from 1995 to 1996, trailing only herbals and botanicals (see Table 5-1). In 1996, sales reached $600 million, anincrease of 18 percent over 1995. Calcium and selenium were two of the best-selling mineralproducts; both benefited from reports of positive clinical trials on their usage and from mediastories (Nutrition Business International, September 1997a). 5.1.3 Herbal and Botanical Supplement Sales As illustrated in Table 5-1, herbal and botanical products totaled $3 billion in sales for a 28 percent share of the DS market. Their growth rate of 20 percent from 1995 to 1996 was thehighest of all DS products. However, sales volumes of specific products are relativelyconcentrated in a few products. Specifically, garlic, ginseng, ginkgo biloba, and echinacea werethe best-selling herbal products in 1995 and 1996 (Table 5-3). The leading herbs in terms of salesgrowth in 1996, each with greater than 50 percent growth (in sales), were ginkgo biloba,echinacea, and saw palmetto. St. John's wort, a relative newcomer to the industry, hasexperienced phenomenal sales growth as well. Table 5-3.

DSproducts in this table include vitamins, herbals and botanicals, sports nutrition, mealsupplements, minerals, and specialty supplements. 7 Percentages of sales by distribution channel for herbals and botanicals in particular are included in Table 5-6. While multilevel marketingand natural food stores each have high market shares of 38 percent and 37 percent, respectively,mass merchandisers trail at only 10 percent. The market share of natural food/health chain stores has been steadily increasing at the expense of the market share of multilevel marketing firms. From 1996 to 1997, natural food and health chainstores sales increased 55 percent while multilevel marketing firm sales were unchanged. Themarket shares of the other distribution channels have remained fairly constant. 7\"Mass merchandisers\" refers to mass merchandise outlets, supermarkets, and drugstores.Table 5-5.

Table 5-7 breaks out the values and quantities of sales by mass market stores for eachof these products. 8 At the specific brand name level (see Table 5-8), food stores led the other mass market stores in sales of some brands, such as One-A-Day, Flintstones, Bugs Bunny, andNature Made and trail in the others. DS product sales in food stores have recently been erratic, asDS sales increased 24 percent in 1993, increased 6 percent in 1994, decreased by 7 percent in1995, and then increased 4 percent in 1996 (Nutrition Business International, October/November1997b). As more consumers are purchasing supplements at food stores and supplements are becoming an important part of the Health and Beauty Care (HBC) section, food stores are responding byincreasing the product mix and the variety and selection they offer. In particular, multivitaminand vitamin shelf space has been increased as has space for children's vitamins. Food stores arealso adding other DS items, especially herbal products, to their product list. In addition to expanding their product mix, food stores are also working to educate consumers and make them aware of supplement product offerings. Educational pamphlets and shelf talkers,which provide information on the shelf about the specific items sold on that shelf, can be found infood stores across the country. Price discounts, coupons, and products with \"25% More Free\" arealso common marketing techniques used in supermarkets for supplement products. Food stores 8The source of these data, Supermarket News , did not include the other dietary supplements.Table 5-7.

December 1996a. \"Dominant Brands Still Up for Grabs in the Nutrition Industry.\" Nutrition Business Journal 1(5):1-3.5-9are also using manufacturers' point-of-purchase displays to generate interest in the products, educate consumers, and explain the uses of products. These displays are generally arranged byproduct attribute without making any health claims; for example, energy , digestion , and the immune system are terms that are used. These displays enable retailers to move the display unit around in the store to get supplement products into high-traffic areas without rearranging existingshelf space, a bonus considering the shortage of shelf space in nutrition products aisles. In addition, some food stores are developing a \"store within a store\" concept for nutrition products, including supplements, to build category awareness. Other ways in which food storesare trying to increase supplement product visibility, include placing vitamins near the checkoutcounter to increase impulse purchases, placing them more prominently in stores, and cross-merchandising supplements with other food categories (e.g., children's vitamins in the cerealaisle, other supplements mixed in with incontinence care). The attention given to expanding product offerings, educating consumers, and giving supplements prominent store location is not a surprise considering the large profits food stores make on DSproducts. The profit margin for most products in food stores ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Dietarysupplements, however, yield profit margins near 40 percent (Gaseau, 1995). A buyer from a largeEast Coast supermarket chain said that pricing is not an issue and that food stores can \"... price[supplements] competitively and make a ton of money\" (Gaseau, 1995). 5.2.2 Drugstore Sales and Marketing Although drugstores are experiencing increased business in the overall supplement category, their market share is declining. Drugstores maintained a 49 percent market share in sales of dietarysupplements and had sales of $1.1 billion, according to AC Neilsen (Nutrition BusinessInternational, October/November 1997c). Drugstores lead the way relative to food stores andmass merchandisers in sales of multivitamins, minerals, one- and two-letter vitamins, and liquidvitamins/minerals (see Table 5-7). In addition, they lead sales of the majority of individual brandslisted in Table 5-8. However, there is evidence that this share is being eroded by massmerchandisers, who experienced a 60 percent increase in vitamin sales in 1994, and natural foodstores ( Chain Drug Review , 1995). To slow the flow of supplement sales toward other retail outlets, drugstores are working to educate consumers and to leverage their unique competitive advantage\u2014the in-housepharmacist\u2014to attract consumers. DS products are intentionally positioned in most drugstoresnear their pharmacies to capitalize on the advantage of having a knowledgeable, accessiblehealth care provider located nearby to educate and help guide consumers in their purchasedecisions. Monthly newsletters, manufacturer-supplied informational brochures, and educationalprograms are also being offered by chain drugstores as a means to educate consumers. In addition to trying to educate consumers, drugstores are also increasing the number of products they offer in response to rising demand and are using the media to highlight their larger product5-10mix. The expanded shelf space is likely to be filled with herbal products, as drugstores increase the number of herbal products they carry. Advertisements inform consumers that the drugstorescarry these herbal products. In general, West Coast drugstore chains have larger stores andgenerally devote more shelf space to the supplement category than those east of the Mississippi,although East Coast stores are trying to turn the supplement section into a destination departmentfor shoppers. Some drug chains also use secondary display locations in the store to drive impulsesales. As in food stores, manufacturers are also using point-of-purchase displays in drugstores to educate consumers about their products. Information Delivery Systems of California is taking thisapproach one step further in chain drugstores across the country. They are providing these storeswith a point-of-purchase audio system that allows customers to ask about and receive informationon over 60 key nutrients, botanicals, and related products. Manufacturers benefit from thissystem as they receive feedback on the number of times an inquiry was made about a producteach week, a feature that provides them with quantitative data on how well their marketing andpublic relations activities are working. Several major retailers are also working to developCD-ROM touch screen technology to allow consumers to determine which products best fit theirneeds. Drugstores also advertise price discounts in flyers and in other media to generate sales. 5.2.3 Mass Merchandiser Sales and Marketing Mass merchandise outlets accounted for approximately $665 million in sales of dietary supplements in 1996, giving these mass retailers a 26 percent market share (Nutrition BusinessInternational, October/November 1997c). Over 40 percent of these sales were vitamin products,for a total of $266.6 million in sales (F-D-C Reports, Inc., 1997b; F-D-C Reports, Inc., 1997c). Mass merchandisers carry a broad mix of private label and brand names, although most of the major advertising expenditure is on national brands. The presentation and mix that massmerchandisers offer consumers is more streamlined and mainstream than that found in healthfood stores, meaning that their product lines are similar to those in supermarkets and drugstores.Mass merchandisers carry what may be viewed as \"commodity products.\" Product lines ofnational-brand multivitamins, in particular, are better represented in mass merchandise outletsthan in health food stores. Mass merchandisers make buying decisions on the national level andtherefore wield large buying power. This enables them to be very price sensitive in choosingwhich products to carry and to refrain from getting locked into long-term contracts withmanufacturers and distributors. Therefore, mass merchandisers have great flexibility indetermining which products to present to consumers and the power to obtain these products atlow prices. Like drugstores and supermarkets, mass merchandisers are struggling to educate their consumers. Those that have pharmacies in the store position DS and nutrition products near the pharmacy.Mass merchandisers are also making an effort to educate their pharmacists by offering them5-11continuing education programs, newsletters, and seminars. Point-of-purchase displays, common in drugstores and supermarkets, are also used extensively in mass merchandise retail outlets. Inaddition, targeted couponing, shelf promotions, and pricing strategies are also used by massmerchandisers to generate supplement sales. 5.2.4 Natural Food Store Sales and Marketing Natural and health food stores commanded $4.5 billion in DS sales in 1997 for an overall market share of 35 percent (see Table 5-5). Sales increased 55 percent from 1996 to 1997, makingnatural food stores the fastest growing DS distribution channel. Sales of herbal and botanicalproducts are more concentrated in natural food stores and multilevel marketing firms than in theoverall supplement category with 37 percent and 38 percent, respectively, of the herbal andbotanical market (see Table 5-6). Of the natural food stores, General Nutrition Centers (GNC) stands out with $1.2 billion in sales in 1996, or 20 percent of the $6.2 billion retail market for supplements (Nutrition BusinessInternational, October/November 1997d). Large natural food store companies, such as GNC,produce their own products and may manufacture private-label products for supermarkets anddrugstores as well. Other natural food stores carry both national brands and private label brandsmanufactured by other companies. In the past, many natural foods stores concentrated on sports nutrition. Now they are focusing on sales strategies that are science-based and concentrating on good nutrition and care of the body tolure consumers. GNC in particular is also trying to appeal to mainstream consumers viaadvertisements on network television. In addition, stores are taking steps to customize theirservice as well. Some natural foods stores are creating nutrition profiles for customers to fit theirown lifestyles and needs and others are packaging the DS regime, which is tailored to anindividual, right in the store. At Great Earth stores, the sales staff must pass a unique 5-weektraining course. In addition to the more scientific and individualized approach, health food storesare also using touch-screen computers for research information and consumer education, point-of-purchase displays, educational literature, pamphlets, and newsletters. Natural food stores alsoadvertise their products, among other places, in magazines, on the Internet, and on radio andtelevision. Natural food stores have recently begun to broaden their customer base by establishing stores on military bases. GNC will open an undisclosed number of stores on military bases in order to tapan estimated $1 billion commissary market (Tascarella, 1997). In addition, Fitness and NutritionCenters already has outlets on Department of Defense property. 5.2.5 Multilevel Marketing Multilevel marketing, also known as direct selling, party plans, relationship selling, person-to- person selling, and network marketing, accounts for a large percentage of consumer sales in the5-12DS industry. In 1997, multilevel marketing firms accounted for 23 percent of overall DS sales (see Table 5-5). Multilevel marketing of DS products experienced no growth from 1996 to 1997.However, it accounted for the largest percentage of sales (38 percent) of herbal and botanicalproducts in 1996 (see Table 5-6). Direct selling has been a relatively successful distribution channel for the nutrition industry. The product is consumable, which is vital for the sustained growth and profitability of multilevelmarketing firms, and sales benefit from consumer education and the word-of-mouth techniqueintrinsic in person-to-person selling. The personal relationship established between distributorand customer may be a competitive advantage for direct selling companies. Multilevel marketingalso gives companies another sales advantage in that distributors are able to quickly andinexpensively dispense information on product research and new scientific studies. In addition,companies are able to keep their selling networks full with many new products as the nutritionindustry expands. Multilevel marketing is a growing industry that is increasingly attracting more companies for a variety of reasons. Multilevel marketing attracts small manufacturers in particular, as it is one ofthe few alternatives available to them without the high slotting fees and advertising expendituresof traditional retail sales. The improvement of information technology, which facilitates productdistribution, and tracking of products, customers and distributor performance, has attracted moreentrants into multilevel marketing. In addition to these cost-saving improvements, technology hasenabled communication up and down the sales network to be more efficient and cost-effective,thereby enabling the companies to get the product to the consumer at a lower cost, which makesthe business more attractive to potential entrants. The downsizing of corporate America andrestructuring of the workforce has also contributed to the growth in multilevel firms by increasingthe demand for entrepreneurial opportunities. Multilevel marketing provides an opportunity for\"downsized\" people to earn money to get back on their feet and bridge the gap between jobs orto start a new career. 5.2.6 Mail Order and Internet Sales and Marketing Mail order channels make up only 6 percent of sales of dietary supplements (see Table 5-5). The market share of mail order remained fairly constant from 1996 to 1997 even as the nutritionindustry's growth continued. Mail order accounted for a slightly larger percentage of herbal andbotanical product sales (9 percent) in 1996 than overall supplement category sales (see Table 5-5and 5-6). As of 1997, according to Nutrition Business Journal, there were about 300 mail order companies carrying dietary supplement products (Nutrition Business International, September1998). Nutrition Headquarters and Amrion, which was acquired by Whole Foods, are two of thelargest of these companies. Marketing for mail order is carried out via 800 numbers on shopping channels on the television, on the Internet, and through media advertising. Advertisements on the Internet frequently refer to5-13scientific studies done on the product and generally include personal testimonials from \"product users.\" Some companies carrying out mail order operations via the Internet have come underscrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC contacted about 400 companies inNovember 1997 following a 2-day sting operation in which these companies were found to bemaking deceptive or potentially false advertising claims. 5.2.7 Health Care Practitioner Sales and Marketing Health care practitioners made up a small segment of dietary supplement sales at 6 percent of the total DS product market in 1997 (see Table 5-5) and 4 percent of the herbal and botanical productmarket (see Table 5-6). However, sales grew by approximately 17 percent from 1996 to 1997(see Table 5-5). Rather than being seen as a retail outlet, physicians and chiropractors are usedgenerally by supplement manufacturers and companies as marketing avenues to get informationabout their products out to potential customers. The supplement companies educate health carepractitioners on the science behind their products in hopes that the research-supported messageof their products' benefits are passed on to the doctors' patients, who will then buy theirsupplements. 5.2.8 Specialty Shops Specialty shops include small, family-run stores as well as ethnic food stores that carry dietary supplements in addition to other products. They account for only 2 percent of herbal andbotanical product sales (see Table 5-6). Sales growth in 1996 was only 10 percent compared to agrowth rate of 25 percent at all retail outlets for natural products (Nutrition Business International,September 1997a). 5.2.9 Distributor and Manufacturer Marketing Efforts In addition to the marketing efforts of retail outlets, manufacturers and distributors engage in marketing efforts as well. To get their products on the shelves at supermarkets, drugstores, massmerchandise outlets, and health food stores, they use a variety of marketing techniques. Forexample, they place advertisements in medical journals and in the Physicians' Desk Reference as well as on network television and radio and in magazines to develop consumer and retailer brandloyalty to their products. Manufacturers also rely heavily on advertising in retail tradepublications such as Supermarket Business and Drug Store News and support large retail outlets with advertising in the mass media and through public relations campaigns. In addition, manufacturers supply retail outlets with the point-of-purchase displays to use in their stores, which gets their products into more heavily trafficked areas of the store. To generate salesof their own products and to make their products more attractive for retailers to carry,manufacturers provide coupons at the store level, give retailers money to advertise, and produce\"bonus bottles\" with, for example, 30 percent more of the product inside for free. They also offerretailers chain-specific promotions, targeted coupons, and cooperative advertising to client stores.5-145.3 MARKET STRUCTURE OF THE DIETARY SUPPLEMENT INDUSTRY Market structure is of interest because it determines the behavior of producers and consumers in the industry. If an industry is perfectly competitive, then individual producers are not able toinfluence the price of the output they sell or the inputs they purchase. This condition is mostlikely to hold if the industry has a large number of firms, the products sold and the inputspurchased are undifferentiated, and entry and exit of firms is unrestricted. Product differentiationcan occur from both differences in product attributes and quality and from brand namerecognition of products. Entry and exit of firms is unrestricted for most industries except, forexample, in cases in which government regulates who is able to produce, one firm holds a patenton a product, one firm owns the entire stock of a critical input, or a single firm is able to supplythe entire market. In the next section, we consider the factors that affect the degree of competition (number of firms and concentration ratios, product differentiation, and barriers to entry) as well as the degree ofvertical integration. We focus primarily on the input markets for raw materials and the outputmarkets for wholesale DS products. 5.3.1 Market Concentration Four-firm and eight-firm concentration ratios (CR4 and CR8) and Herfindahl-Hirschman indexes provide preliminary information that is useful in determining the structure of the market.Although the U.S. Department of Commerce computes these values, they do so only in censusyears and at the 4-digit SIC level. Because the most recent information available is from the 1992census and DS products are scattered across SIC codes, measures of concentration from thissource are of little use for the DS industry. However, we were able to construct a few measuresof concentration using information available from the Nutrition Business Journal . The September 1998 issue of the Nutrition Business Journal lists the top 40 manufacturing firms with their 1997 revenues and provides the summary information that is contained in Table 5-9.Using this information, we calculated that the CR4 is 23 percent, the CR8 is 39 percent, and theHHI is 250 (see Appendix A). Based on these values, the DS product manufacturing market is nothighly concentrated. While there are not specific criteria for evaluating CR4s and CR8s, the 1992Department of Justice's Horizontal Merger Guidelines states that industries with HHIs below1,000 are unconcentrated. The October 1996 issue of the Nutrition Business Journal provides the 1995 summary information on vitamin and herbal and botanical raw material suppliers that is contained in Table 5-9, but itdoes not list the revenues for individual suppliers that is necessary to construct all the measures ofconcentration. However, based on the information they provide, the CR8 for the vitamin rawmaterial market is 73 percent and for the herbal and botanical raw material market, 36 percent.5-15Table 5-9.

Thus, the vitamin raw material market is much more concentrated than either the DS manufacturing market or the herbal and botanical raw material market. In fact, the JusticeDepartment is currently investigating alleged price fixing and collusion in the vitamin rawmaterial market (Scott, 1998). Nearly all vitamin E, in particular, comes from one raw materialsupplier. In the DS market as a whole, mergers and acquisitions have been occurring frequently and are expected to continue. Thus, we expect that market concentration will increase over time.5-165.3.2 Product and Brand Differentiation Dietary supplements are by nature heterogeneous products. Even within a particular DS product type, there are many different types of products and many different forms in which the productsare made available. Thus, many niche markets exist in which companies may be the only or oneof a few manufacturers of a product. However, some of the products are more commodity-likeand there is little differentiation among different manufacturers of the products (e.g., singlevitamin products). Products may also be differentiated based on their brand names within a particular type of product. However, according to the Nutrition Business Journal , the nutrition industry in general has few dominant brands. Some of the reasons they cite are the large number of product niches,the variety of distribution channels, the dynamics of consumer trends (changing preferences overtime), and the evolution of nutrition science (Nutrition Business International, December 1996b).In some markets, however, a few companies have established strong brand name recognition.These include, for example, Centrum, One-A-Day, and Flintstones in the multivitamin market andGinsana and Ginkoba in the herbal and botanical market. 5.3.3 Barriers to Entry In the past, barriers to entry in DS product manufacturing were not particularly high, and many small firms entered the industry. Many products, especially herbal and botanical products, canbe produced in small-scale operations that are not highly capital-intensive. However, the barriersto entry are rising and will continue to do so primarily because of the effects of consolidation andthe effects of regulation, both federal and self-imposed. Because many distributors and retailers are consolidating, it is becoming harder for small companies to gain access to customers (Nutrition Business International, July 1997a). Massmerchandisers that carry DS products need to acquire adequate product from manufacturers tosupply all their needs. Also, because other manufacturers are consolidating, they are purchasinginputs in volume and thus are able to negotiate lower raw material prices than smallermanufacturers. In addition, regulation is making it more difficult for small firms to enter the industry. It may be more difficult for these firms to acquire the needed resources to comply with labeling regulationsas well as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs). Larger pharmaceutical firms that are branchingout into DS product lines will have little trouble complying as their existing products lines ingeneral must conform to much stricter regulations. Some of the regulations are imposed by the industry itself. In particular, the industry, through organizations such as the National Nutritional Foods Association (NNFA), is working towardestablishing standards for DS products. The NNFA has already established a True Label programin which it tests products to ensure that they are as represented on their labels. Although theseself-imposed regulations are voluntary, consumers may come to expect products that conform and5-17may not purchase products that do not. As with federal regulations, smaller firms may not be able to garner the resources for compliance. 5.3.4 Vertical Integration Vertical integration refers to the extent to which firms operate at more than one level of production and marketing. In general, we expect that firms that are more vertically integrated willbe able to retain a higher level of profits than firms that concentrate on a single level of theindustry. In the DS industry, we see examples of both ends of the spectrum. While many firms concentrate on a single level, others, such as GNC, span nearly the entire spectrum from manufacturing toconsumer sales. According to the Nutrition Business Journal , the chain of manufacturing from raw materials to finished products may span four or five companies (Nutrition BusinessInternational, August 1996). On the other hand, multilevel marketers and mail order companies,both of which have a large presence in the DS industry, span many of these levels.6-1SECTION 6 DIETARY SUPPLEMENT INDUSTRY DATA AND PROJECTIONS Because the DS industry comprises a large number of diverse products, industry data must be compiled from a variety of sources. In this section, we present industry data as compiled fromsecondary data sources and discuss projections and predictions for the industry. 6.1 DS INDUSTRY DATA Industry data are useful in characterizing baseline supply and demand conditions in particular DSproduct markets. Compiling this information is the necessary first step in conducting aneconomic impact analysis of a particular regulation. 9 Because the industry comprises such a large number of diverse products, providing detailed statistics on each product market is beyondthe scope of this report. Instead, we provide aggregate industry data and describe our proceduresfor constructing these data. 6.1.1 Domestic Industry Data The most complete and frequently reported industry data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census is reported at the 4-digit SIC level. After examining the descriptions of each SIC code to determinewhich contain DS products, RTI compiled the list of SIC codes in Table 6-1. In addition, thecorresponding North American Industry Classification Scheme (NAICS) codes are provided aswell. Of the products listed in Table 6-1, some are solely DS products and others are used or manufactured by other industries as well. For example, the tea products in SIC 2099 include allteas in addition to those that are considered DS products. SIC codes 2833 and 2834 containproducts that could be considered, depending on use and labeling, either DS products orpharmaceuticals (over the counter or prescription). SIC code 2075 contains all soybean productsin addition to protein supplements. SIC codes 2819, 2869, and 2899 contain chemicals that areused in a wide variety of industries in addition to the DS industry. Some value of shipments data are available for 5- and 7-digit SIC codes that are predominately DS products. These data are provided for SIC codes 2833 and 2834 for 1996 in Table 6-2.However, many DS products are most likely contained in the codes for products \"not stated bykind.\" 9RTI provided detailed information on the types of data needed to conduct an economic impact analysis and the adequacy of secondary data sources for providing it (see Muth and Anderson, 1998).Table 6-1.

January 1998. \"Current Industrial Reports: Pharmaceutical Preparations, Except Biologicals.\" MA28G(96)-1.6-66.1.2 International Trade Data Using 6-digit international codes, RTI compiled information on trade volumes for codes that contain DS products.10 The list of international codes used is provided in Table 6-3 along with the DS type to which we assigned each, their descriptions, and their corresponding SIC codes.Herbal and botanical extracts are combined with all herbals and botanicals because it is notpossible to determine the form of the product based on the international codes. Concentrates,constituents, and metabolites are not specifically identified because they are forms of the productsincluded elsewhere. The products that are classified in the international codes in Table 6-3 include, in addition to dietary supplements, foods, drugs, and products with industrial uses. Thus, estimates of tradevolumes and values based on these 6-digit codes may overstate the true volumes and values forDS products alone. In particular, vitamins include not only vitamins sold as DS products butvitamins used to fortify foods. Minerals include products that may be for industrial uses as well.Sulfur, for example, is sold as a dietary supplement, but most of its sales is likely for industrialuses. Products classified in herbals and botanicals include some products that may be sold asOTC or prescription drugs (e.g., ephedrine). Amino acids, proteins, and teas may be foodproducts in addition to DS products. Using the classifications in Table 6-3, we tabulated trade statistics as reported by the International Trade Commission. However, these trade values include all products for each code rather thanDS products only. In Table 6-4, import values for 1997 are listed by DS product type. Withineach DS product type, the top 10 countries from which the United States imports (by importvalues) are listed individually. In Table 6-5, export values for 1997 are listed as well. Again,within each DS product type, the top 10 countries to which the United States exports (by exportvalues) are listed individually. 6.2 DS INDUSTRY PROJECTIONS Although some trade publications cite the opinion that the DS industry is beginning to mature,high growth rates are still predicted for the foreseeable future. In the recent past, some haveestimated that industry sales have been growing at a rate of 20 to 30 percent a year. The Nutrition Business Journal is predicting an average growth rate of 10 to 14 percent per year to the year 2000 across all DS product types (Nutrition Business International, September 1998). Withinindividual product categories, it is predicting 16 to 18 percent growth rates for herbals and 10Initially, RTI identified 10-digit international codes for dietary supplements (see Muth, 1998). However, because 10-digit codes can differ depending on whether the product is imported or exported, using 6-digit codes appears tobe a more reliable approach.6-7Table 6-3.

As obtained June 1998.6-17botanicals, 6 to 7 percent growth rates for vitamins, 7 to 8 percent growth rates for minerals, 14 to 16 percent for specialty supplements, and 6 to 8 percent for sports supplements (NutritionBusiness International, September 1998). As new products are introduced, the range of DS products will continue to grow. In some cases, sales of individual products will grow as new research indicates the potential use or value of theproduct. In other cases, whole new types of products will be introduced in the market. Inparticular, the industry expects increased sales of herbal products used in Ayurvedic healing,which is a traditional medicine system originating in India (Nutrition Business International,September 1997a). Over time, the industry is expected to continue consolidating into a smaller number of manufacturing firms (Nutrition Business International, July 1997a). The number of smallbusinesses, in particular, is expected to decline due to economies of scale in production and thecost efficiencies that larger manufacturers obtain from volume purchase of inputs. In addition,small manufacturers may be unable to serve the larger retailers that are increasingly selling DSproducts. Sales of DS products by mass merchandisers such as Costco and Kmart are increasing and are expected to continue to grow in the future (Nutrition Business International, October/November1997a). In the past, mass merchandisers carried primarily the traditional vitamin and mineralproducts. However, they are starting to carry a broader range of DS products, including herbalproducts and products such as shark cartilage and melatonin. In addition, strong sales growth isexpected through multilevel marketing firms (Nutrition Business International, November 1996). Combined with the consolidation of manufacturing firms and the growth of sales by mass merchandisers is the importance of identifiable brand names (Nutrition Business International,December 1996a). Consumers seeking consistent quality of products migrate toward particularbrand names. The larger manufacturing firms are more likely to have the resources needed tomaintain consistent quality, the advertising budgets to establish brand name recognition, and theresources to serve a large enough portion of the market to maintain brand name recognition. Because the industry has grown rapidly and is beginning to be considered a legitimate industry, it has attracted the attention of investors on Wall Street (Nutrition Business International, July1997b). The Nutrition Business Journal and Natural Business both maintain stock market information on publicly traded DS product companies. The influx of outside investment dollarswill allow the industry to continue to grow, both by adding new products and by servingadditional markets.R-1REFERENCES 110% Products home page. <http://110.buysafe.com/browse2asp?id=20840>.

InTable A-1, we list the manufacturers and 1997 revenues as reported in the Nutrition Business Journal . First, we calculated each firm's share of total sales. We added the shares of the top 4 firms to obtain a 4-firm concentration ratio of 22.8 percent and the shares of the top 8 firms toobtain an 8-firm concentration ratio of 38.9 percent. To calculate the Herfindahl-Hirschmanindex, we first squared the shares of each manufacturer and then added them together for all 40firms listed to arrive at an HHI of 250.2. Although the HHI theoretically includes the shares of allfirms in the industry, adding the squared shares of firms below the 40th would have little effect onthe HHI.A-2Table A-1.
