Through dissecting mushrooms and studying/understanding how they work, researchers have discovered that these fungi are truly magical. For example, one of the significant findings show that mushrooms creates an extension of our fear response by creating new neurological pathways (or repairing old pathways) when faced with threatening situations. For some, these situations often occur as anxiety, which interferes with social interactions and the ability to cope with life's demands. Not only do mushrooms promote courage, but it enhances empathy - two sought after characteristics of quality leaders.

HOW Mushrooms WORK Mushrooms work by mimicking serotonin - a chemical that affects nearly everything we do, from how we feel to how we process information. As a result, this stimulates a serotonin receptor called 5-HT2A located in our prefrontal cortex of the brain. This leads to two important results: The production of Brand Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) which stimulates growth, connections, and activity in the brain. Our Microdosing Guides and information pulls detailed research from mycology articles into an informative guide that illustrates the benefits of implementing micro doses into your daily routine. "}
