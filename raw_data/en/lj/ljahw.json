After the second dose of vaccine administration, the immunological responses of TURKOVAC and CoronaVac vaccines will be demonstrated by neutralizing antibodies and anti-spiked antibodies. A total of 644 subjects will be enrolled. Subjects will be assigned according to randomization (1:1) for 2 different arms. The assigned vaccine will be administered to subjects in two doses on days 0 and 28. |Study Type Randomized, Observational Blind Phase IIB Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Effectiveness, Immunogenicity and Safety of Two Doses of CoronaVac (Sinovac) Vaccine Against Two Doses of Inactivated COVID-19 Vaccine (TURKOVAC) in Healthy Adolescent (12-18 Years) Subjects| |Actual Study Start Date :||January Primary Date :||May of the TURKOVAC vaccine will be 3 g/0.5 mL.
