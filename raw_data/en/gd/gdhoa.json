FOREWORD Asscientificandtechnologicaladvancesmakelifeincreasinglycomplex,providing food for the family also becomes more complex. Nutrition researchindicates that food choices influence one's health, energy, and appearance bothnowandinthefuture.Choicesinthefood marketbecomeincreasinglycomplicated as new and different forms of food are introduced. Modern equipmentprovidesnew and different ways to prepare and store foods. In addition,changing lifestyles increase the need for effective management of resources inproviding food for self and the family. Thus, education in planning, selecting,storing,preparing,serving,andthe proper care of kitchen appliances areimportant.Through the effort and study of many people this guide was developed to be usedby Consumer Home Economics teachers as a resource in planning and teaching theyear-long course in Foods and Nutrition for students in grades 9-12.Teachersare urged to use their creativity in adapting and expanding the suggestions inthis guide.Technical assistance in implementing this program is available from the HomeEconomics Education State Staff. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Many people have contributed to the development of this Curriculum Guide and theHome Economics Consultant Staff wish to express their appreciation to all ofthose individuals involved in the project.

COURSE DESCRIPTION HE7045(S-1 or Y-1)Credit:or 1Grades:9-12Enr.:12-20 FOODS AND NUTRITION Semester 1:Studentslearnto makeinformed choices of dailyTea.The content includes nutrition as it relates to health andappearance, and food patterns and customs.

Career opportunities in the field ofFoods, Nutrition, and Food Services are explored.Prerequisite:Foods and Nutrition, Semester 1 INTRODUCTION TO COMPETENCY-BASED, INDIVIDUALIZED PROGRAMS The most witiely accepted DEFINITION OF COMPETENCY-BASED was suggestedbyStanlyAlam,whodescribestheessentialelementsofcompetency-basededucation as follows: 1.Competencies (knowledge, skills,behaviors demonstrated by student are stated soasto makepossible assessment of a student's behavior in relation tospecific competencies; and made public in advance. 2.Criteria to be employed in assessing competencies are basedupon, and in harmony with, specified competencies; explicitinstatingexpectinglevelsofmasteryunderspecifiedconditions; and made public in advance. 3.Assessmentofthestudent'scompetencyusesstudent'sperformance asthe primary source of evidence; takes intoaccountevidenceofthestudent'sknowledgerelevanttoplanningfor,analyzing,interpreting, orevaluatingsituations; and strives for objectivity. 4.Thestudent'srateofprogressthroughtheprogramisdetermined by demonstrated competence rather than by time orcourse completion. 5.Theinstructionalprogramisintendedtofacilitatethedevelopment and evaluation of the student's achievement ofcompetencies specified.OTHER CHARACTERISTICS FOUND IN COMPETENCY-BASED PROGRAMS ARE: 1.Instruction is individualized and personalized. 2.Learningexperiencesoftheindividualareguidedbyfeedback (evaluation). 3.The program as a whole is systemic. 4.The emphasis is on exit, not entrance, requirements. 0t./ 5.Instruction ismodularized(i.e.,arrangedinalogicalsequence of steps to be learned). 6.The student is held accountable for performance, completingthe program when, and only when, he/she demonstrates thecompetencies that have been identified. Basedon. theprecedingcharacteristics, thefollowingtermsandworkingdefinitions are generally accepted for use in North Carolina.Competency-Based Education (CBE) - A system for planning and implementingclassroom activities which will help each student develop certain specifiedcompetencies.Mastery Learning - Term used to indicate an approach to learning in whichstudents are expected to \"master\"(i.e., become proficient with; becomecompetent in) the knowledge and skills specified as course outcomes.Individualized instruction - A systemfor managingthelearningprocessand environment in such a way that the individual differences of studentsareaccommodatedwhiletheyareworkingtoachieveprogramgoals,competencies, and objectives.Competency Testing - The testingofstudentstodetermineiftheyhavedevelopedthosecompetenciesspecifiedforaprogram(i.e.,theyarelearning what they are supposed to learn).Criterion-Referenced Competency Testing - The testing of each student usingtestsreferencedtospecificobjectivesfor competency mastery. Usingcriterion-referenced tests (CRTs) results in a comparison of the student'sperformance with the specific standard(s) rather than the performance ofother students.Accountability - Simply, the \"ability to account for\" and usually impliesthat quantitative evidence is available as documentation or proof.Instructional Accountability - A processwhichinvolvesassessing(measuring) student progress and achievement and being able to document towhat extent students have learned what they are supposed to learn (i.e.,being able to show that students have mastered the competencies). SECTION 2:COMPETENCY LISTING The Competencies and Instructional Objectives for the course are included inthislisting.COMPETENCIESare sequenced according tothe teacher-writers'recommendations as to the best teaching sequence for first semester and then forasecondsemester of the course. INSTRUCTIONAL OBJECTIVES are grouped and 111/1sequencedforeachcompetency.Someteachersmayprefertoteachunits,competencies, and/or instructional objectivesina different order than shownduring a given semester. xi The COMPETENCY STATEMENTS provide the foundation upon which the objectives, 1111/content outline, teaching/learning activiti*s, resources, and bank of test itemsare based.The verb in each competency statement and instructional objectivegives the key to-Te domain and level of behavior identified and the kind ofteaching, learning, an testing wETIFFsFauld be done. In other words, thesecompetencystatements\"spellout\"forstudents,parents,andotherstheknowledge and skills that completers of the course can be expected to possess.

Teachers are encouraged to use the Competency Listing to develop a yearly orUNIT PLAN OF WORK for the course. The Competency Listing may be reproduced andgiven to the students at the beginning of the course so that they will know whatis expected of them during the course. This could serve as an introduction tothe course, a unit within the course, and/or a review for a unit test. It isalso suggested thatteachers examine the competenciesintermsof specificFHA/HERO proficiency events and activities and then plan to incorporate themappropriately in various units throughout the course.

These test items areintended for use in evaluating anddocumenting student performance in mastering the competencies.

An interpretation of the code is shown in thebox which follows: INTERPRETATION OF TEST-ITEM CODE anyInstructionalObjective in 001Completes theUnique Numberfor this test item A test item coded 006-02-03 would be the third test item for Competency 6 andInstructionalObjective 6.2. Tobuildatestforagradingperiodthat\"covered\"competencies1-6,ateacher would selectfromthosetestitemsnumbered 001-00-01 through 006-00-05. The teacher also would prepare a TESTBLUEPRINT in order to balance the test. This would assure the INSTRUCTIONALVALIDITY OF THE TEST. A test has \"instructional validity\" wLen the items on thetest match the content as it was covered in class. Keep in mind that studentTades and reports should be based on instructionally-valid tests.KEYS for the test items are included as a separate section at the end of theCompetency/Test-Item section. To FIND THE ANSWER KEY FOR A TEST-ITEM, simplylocate its code number. Using the results of testing throughout the course, the xiv teacher may wish to prepare a Certificate of Competency Mastery or StudentCompetency Record for each student. A record of the competencies acquiredduring the program can give the student and the parents specific informationabout what was learned by the student in the program. Teachers are encouragedto reproduceand use thisrecordasapart of their student grading andreporting system and/or customize it for use in their own situations.Ow.
