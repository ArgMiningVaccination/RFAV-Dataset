The shops all have one thing in common: strings of dried fish maw and dried seafood bundled together, covering the store fronts like curtains.

Seahorse, Centipede, and Other Ingredients You'll Find in Traditional Chinese Medicine Shops [Alison Fung](https://matadornetwork.com/author/alisonfung/)Jul 22, 2019 Early in the morning in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been a part of Chinese culture for thousands of years. The practice focuses on healing and restoring balance in the body. The [earliest record](https://www.britannica.com/science/traditional-Chinese-medicine) of TCM is the Huangdi neijing (The Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic), which dates back to the third century BCE. The concepts from this time still translate today. The herbal bible of TCM, the Compendium of Materia Medica, was written in the 1500s and lists over 1,800 ingredients ranging from the common to the obscure. It'd take a lifetime to learn all of the ingredients, but these are some of the things you're likely to see if you get a chance to visit a store in [China](https://matadornetwork.com/destinations/asia/china/). Gul\u00ednggo, or tortoise shell jelly Turtles represent longevity in Chinese culture, and turtle shells are an important medicinal ingredient. Shells are harvested, boiled for hours, and then mixed with water and herbs. It's all cooked down into a black, gelatin-like mixture said to improve skin complexions and lower cholesterol. The gelatin mixture is eaten as a jelly topped with sugar syrup or other sweet foods to mask the bitterness. You can find these ready-made jellies in herbal stores and supermarkets across Hong Kong and China. Dng ch\u00f3ng xi\u00e0 co, or caterpillar fungus Caterpillar fungus (Ophiocordyceps sinensis) is a type of parasitic fungus that takes over the body of ghost moth larvae. It grows in the living larvae, eventually killing it and using its body for fuel to grow a short stalk. The fungus is found in the winter in the plateaus of Tibet and Northern China, where it's hunted down by experienced collectors and sold for as much as $30,000 per kilogram. The fungus, no more than one inch long, is said to strengthen immunity and fight off cancer. You can find caterpillar fungus in soups, steamed eggs, and steamed vegetables served at high-end restaurants across the country.

The fatty tissue is believed to treat stomach ulcers, improve skin complexions, and provide nutrients to a woman's reproductive system. When soaked into water, hasma becomes gelatinous.
