Tanya Penn Senior Research Scientist/Principal Investigator Martha Crowe Research Associate Our Local Community For both the SMH 2022 CHNA and HASD&IC 2022 CHNA processes, the time and expertise devoted by hundreds of community members \u2014 including community residents, physicians, hea lth care professionals, community health leaders, public health officials and others dedicated to the health and well -being of our community \u2014 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment vi were essential to develop a comprehensive, collaborative assessment of the health and social needs in San Diego. We are particularly grateful to those patients and community residents who shared their personal insight regarding health care access and challenges to health and well -being, especially amid our community's navigation of the COVID -19 pandemic. Sharp woul d like to extend our deepest thanks for the contributions made by all who participated in the 2022 CHNA process. Further, Sharp is committed to providing a CHNA that is valuable to all our community partners, and we look forward to strengthening that value and those partnerships in the years to come. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 1 Section 1 Executive Summary Sharp HealthCare (Sharp) has been a longtime partner in the process of identifying and responding to the health needs of the San Diego community. This partnership includes a broad range of hospitals, health care organizations and community agencies that have worked together to conduct triennial community health needs assessments (CHNAs) for more than 20 years. Previous collaborations among not -for-profit hospitals and other community partners have resulted in numerous well -regarded CHNA reports. Sharp hospi tals, including Sharp Memorial Hospital (SMH ) and Sharp Mary Birch Hospit al for Women & Newborns (SMBHWN ), base their community benefit and community health programs on the findings of their CHNAs, expertise in programs and services offered at their hospit al, and knowledge of the populations and communities they serve. SMH prepared this CHNA for fiscal year 2022 (FY 2022) in accordance with the requirements of Section 501(r)(3) within Section 9007 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Afforda ble Care Act) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS ) Form 990, Schedule H , for not -for-profit hospitals.1 In accordance with federal regulations, the Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (SMH 2022 CHNA) also includes needs identified for communities served by SMBHWN, as the two hospitals share a license, and report all utilization and financial data as a single entity to the California Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) .2 The SMH 2022 CHNA summarizes the pr ocesses and findings for communities served by both hospital entities. The SMH 2022 CHNA process and findings are based on the collaborative Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (HASD&IC 2022 CHNA) process and findings for San Diego County (SDC ). HASD&IC CHNA Collaboration and Governance The HASD&IC Board of Directors represents all member sectors and provides policy direction to ensure the interests of member hospitals and health systems are preserved and promoted. The CHNA Advisory Workgroup includes representatives from every participat ing hospital and health system and provides overarching guidance regarding the research approach and community engagement. The CHNA Committee works closely with the CHNA Advisory Workgroup and reports to the HASD&IC Board of Directors . The CHNA Committee i s responsible for implementing the countywide CHNA and includes representatives from the following San Diego hospitals and health care systems: Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 2 Kaiser Permanente Rady Children's Hospital Scripps Health (Vice Chair) Sharp HealthCare (Chair) Tri City Medical Center UC San Diego Health The process and findings of the collaborative HASD&IC 2022 2022 CHNA was further supported by additional data analysis and community engagement activities specific to the communit ies served by SMH and SMBHWN . The findings of the SMH 2022 CHNA will be used to help guide current and future community health programs and servi ces at SMH and SMBHWN , particularly for high -need community members. In addition, SMH will develop and make publicly available its three -year implementation strategy \u2014 a federally required written strategy to address the needs identified through the SMH 2022 CHNA process. The CHNA is considered adopted once it has been made widely available to the public. In addition, the CHNA and the implementation strategy must be approved by an authorized governing body of the hospital facility. 2022 CHNA Objectives Conducting a CHNA during a pandemic brought challenges to both planning and implementation. Both HASD&IC and Sharp developed new strategies to maintain strong connections with community members and community -based organizations (CBOs) throughout the communi ty engagement process. In addition, the community's needs have evolved continuously over the past few years as the pandemic has progressed. Specific objectives of the 2022 CHNA processes included: Identify, understand , and prioritize the health and soci al needs of SDC residents , especially those community members served by Sharp. Provide a greater understanding of barriers to health improvement in SDC and inform and guide local hospitals in the development of programs and strategies that address identif ied community health needs. Build on and strengthen community partnerships established through the 2019 CHNA processes. Explore the current impact of COVID -19 on the community health needs identified by the 2019 CHNA. Obtain deeper feedback from and about communities in SDC facing inequities. Align with national best practices around CHNA development and implementation, including the integration of health conditions with social determinants of health (SDOH). Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 3 The HASD&IC and Sharp (including SMH and SMBHWN ) 2022 CHNA community engagement processes used interviews, focus groups and online surveys with a wide range of stakeholders. Input was gathered from community residents and patients, community health workers (CHWs) , CBOs , service providers, civic leaders, health care leaders and experts, hospital and health care providers and staff, case managers, social workers, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) , and local government staff. The 2022 CHNA also included extensive quantitative analysis of na tional and state -wide data sets, SDC emergency department (ED) and inpatient hospital discharge data, community clinic usage data, county mortality and morbidity data , and data related to SDOH. The mixed -use approach to data collection and analysis made it possible to view community health needs from multiple perspectives. Community Defined For the purposes of the collaborative HASD&IC 2022 CHNA, the study area encompasse s all of SDC due to a broad representation of hospitals in the area. More than 3 million people live in socially and ethnically diverse SDC. Information on key demographics, socioeconomic factors, access to care, health behaviors and the physical environment can be found in the full HASD&IC 2022 CHNA report at: https://hasdic .org. The the communities served by both SMH and SMBHWN. As a specialty hospital providing care for expectant mothers and newborns , as well as wom en's services, SMBHWN serves the entire community of SDC. Co mbined with the communities served by SMH, the study are a for the SMH 2022 CHNA includes all six regions of SDC: central, east, north central, north coastal, north inland and south . Table 1 presents ZIP codes where the majority of SMH and SMBHWN patients r eside.

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 4 92102 East San Diego 92154 Nestor 92104 North Park Recognizing that health needs differ across SDC regions and that socioeconomic factors impact health outcomes, SMH 's 2022 CHNA process used the Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health Community Need Index (CNI) to identify communities within its service area that experience greater health inequities. Table 2 presents ZIP code s of the primary communities served by SMH and SMBHWN that have especially high need based on their CNI score.

The purpose of this effort was to address the historical, systemic and social drivers disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations including people of color, so cially disadvantaged groups and those living in poverty. Health Equity Framework Figure 1 details the health equity framework adopted by the CHNA Committee to help guide collective research, analysis and community engagement. San Diego hospitals, health systems, and health districts are committed to a CHNA process that reflects the shared values outlined in the healthy equity framework. 4 Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health Community Need Index (2022). Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 5 Figure 1: HASD&IC 2022 CHNA Health Equity Framework Research Methods and Approach To gain a deep and meaningful understanding of the health and social needs of SDC residents, two primary methods were employed for the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA: 1. Quantitative analyses of existing publicly available data were conducted to provide an overarching view of crit ical health issues across SDC . 2. Qualitative information was gathered through a comprehensive community engagement process to understand people's lived experiences and needs in the community. The CHNA Committee reviewed the feedback and data to prioritize the top needs in SDC. Please see Figure 2 for more information on the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA process. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 6 Figure 2: HASD&IC 2022 CHNA - Process Map Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 7 Quantitative Data Quantitative data were used for three primary purposes: 1. Describe the SDC community 2. Plan and design the community engagement process 3. Facilitate the \"prioritization process\" \u2014 identifying the most serious community health needs of SDC residents who face in equities Quantitative data included: California's HCAI limited data sets, 2017 -2019 SpeedTrack\u00a95 CNI4 Public Health Alliance of Southern California Healthy Places Index (HPI) National and statewide data sets including SDC mortality and morbidity data and data related to SDOH The HPI and the CNI were used to identify the most under -resourced geographic areas . This information helped guide the community engagement process, including selecting communities from which to solicit input and developing relevant and meaningful engagement topics and questions. The following reports and dashboards from the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency were also used : County of San Diego Community Health Statistics Health Disparities Executive Summary Report6 Racial Equi ty: Framework and Outcomes Brief San Diego County Self - Sufficiency Standard, Household with Two Adults, One Preschool - Age Child and One School -Age Child, 2021 Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) Health Equity Dashboard Series: Racial Equity Dashboards San Diego County Self - Sufficiency Standard Dashboard COVID -19 in San Diego County Dashboard LGBTQ+ Health and Well -Being Dashboard 5 SpeedTrack's Population Health Decision Support Platform, was utilized to export emergency department and inpatient hospital discharge data. 6 County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), Public Health Services (PHS), Community Health Statistics Unit (CHSU) (2022 ), Exploring Health Disparities in San Diego County: Executive Summary . www.SDHealthStatistics.com Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 8 Qualitative Data: Community Engagement Activities The goal of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement process was to solicit input from a wide range of stakeholders so the sample was as representative as possible of those facing inequities in SDC. A total of 841 individuals participated in HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement activities. Input from the community was gathered through the following efforts: Working with CHWs to conduct interviews with community members Conducting focus groups and key informant interviews with community members, CHWs, CBOs , service providers, civic leaders and health care leaders (conducted in collaboration with Kaiser Foundation Hospital -San Diego) Conducting focus groups and key informant interviews with hospital and health system clinicians, case managers, social wo rkers and executive leaders Distributing an online survey to community members, hospital staff, CBOs , FQHCs and local government staff Please see Figure 3 below for a summary of community engagement participation in the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 9 Figure 3: HASD&IC 2022 CHNA - Summary of Community Engagement Participation Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 10 SMH 2022 CHNA The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA process provided for the development of the SMH 2022 CHNA, with additional Sharp -specific quantitative data analysis and community engagement activities completing the SMH 2022 CHNA process. Quantitative Data The SMH 2022 CHNA process included strategic analysis by Sharp's Clinical Analytics team of internal hospital and clinic data to explore observations and trends among Sharp's patient population, particularly related to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. Data ca me from a variety of sources, including the Cerner Millennium electronic medical record, hospital and clinic claims data, managed care enrollment and clinical registries. Key service -line stakeholders in behavioral health and oncology, along with Sharp's Emergency Department Collaborative and Clinical Effectiveness department also participated in the process to ensure the accuracy of data sources and metrics. SMH also used SpeedTrack's California Universal Patient Information Discovery application to anal yze HCAI hospital discharge data, which provided insight on top diagnoses, trends and demographic characteristics among inpatients at SMH and SMBHWN as well as individuals who visited the ED at SMH during CY 2020. This analysis reinforced key themes identi fied in the Sharp and HASD&IC 2022 CHNA processes. In addition, SMH and SMBHWN used the CNI to identify the communities in their service area s experiencing health inequities . This i nclud ed overlaying hospital discharge data for specific health conditions on top of CNI data in order to analyze the connection between those health conditions and under -resourced communities in SDC. Qualitative Data: Community Engagement Activities Sharp conducted community engagement activities specifically for the community members it serves . Sharp collected input through three electronic surveys: 1. A survey for select Sharp health care pro vider s, particularly those professionals who serve patients with health equity challenges. 2. A survey for Sharp human resources (HR) professionals \u2014 representing the experiences of Sharp team members impacted by health and equity challenges. 3. A survey for the Sharp Insight Community \u2014 representing Sharp current and former patients (or their families and caregivers), some Sharp -affiliated physicians , and community members unaffiliated with Sharp. The first two surveys were conducted in contract with the Institute for Public Health at San Diego State University (IPH) and included 108 participants. The third survey was implemented in partnership with Sharp's Consumer Research team and included 619 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 11 participants . Table 3 summarizes the SMH 2022 CHNA surveys .

Several criteria were ap plied to the data to determine which health conditions were of the highest priority in SDC. These criteria included: the severity of the need , the magnitude/scale of the need , disparities or inequities and change over time. Those health conditions and SDOH that met the largest number of criteria were then selected as priority community health needs. As the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA process included robust representation from the communities served by SMH and SMBHWN , this prioritization process was replicated for SMH 2022 CHNA. Findings: Top Community Needs The CHNA Committee identified the following priority community needs for SDC ( listed in alphabetical order) : Figure 4: HASD&IC 2022 CHNA - Top Community Needs for SDC Access to Health Care Aging Care & Support Behavioral Health Children & Youth Well -Being Chronic Health Conditions Community Safety Economic Stability Figure 4 above represents the top identified community needs, the foundational challenges, and the key underlying themes revealed t hrough the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA process. The needs identified as the most critical for San Diegans are listed in the center of the circle in alphabetical \u2014 not ranked \u2014 order. The blue outer arrows of the circle represent the negative impact of two foundation al challenges \u2014 health disparities and workforce shortages \u2014 which greatly exacerbated every identified need at the center of the circle. The orange bars within the outer circle illustrate the underlying themes of stigma and trauma \u2014 the quiet yet insidiou s barriers that became more pervasive during the COVID -19 pandemic. The graphic demonstrates how each component of the findings \u2014 the top identified community needs, the foundational challenges, and the key underlying themes \u2014 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 13 impact one another. In par ticular, the foundational challenges (health disparities and workforce shortages) and underlying themes (stigma and trauma) interact with each other to amplify the identified community needs as well as disrupt efforts that advance health equity and improve community well -being. These findings were also supported through both the quantitative analysis and community engagement activities conducted as part of the SMH 2022 CHNA. In addition, Maternal & Prenatal Care, including High -Risk Pregnancy , was also identified as a community health need by the SMH 2022 CHNA. Community Recommendations 2022 CHNA community engagement participants were asked , \"What are the most important things that hospitals and health systems could do to improve health and well-being in our community?\" Overwhelmingly, respondents agreed that there is a critical need to help patients navigate available services that will help improve their health and well -being. In both the interviews and the surveys, suggestions that center ed around improved patient care rose to the top. Most responses fell into four categories: navigation and support, culturally appropriate care, workforce development and community collaboration. See Table 4 for the types of recommendations identified by HASD&IC's community engagement participants. Table 4: HASD&IC 2022 CHNA - Community Recommendations for Hospitals and Health Systems to Improve Community Health and Well -Being HASD&IC 2022 CHNA COMMUNITY ENGAGEM ENT RECOMMENDATIONS Provide Navigation & Support to Patients Connect patients to services that will improve their health & well -being Help patients understand and use health coverage Help patients coordinate their health services Help patients apply for health coverage or other benefits Help patients pay for their health care bills Provide Culturally Appropriate Care to Patients Ensure that a patient's care meets their needs Provide culturally appropriate health care in more languages Train hospital staff on biases Workforce Development Diversify the health care workforce Hire more doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals Create more health care job opportunities and career pathways Community Collaboration Collaborate with community groups and schools Provide health education Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 14 SMH 2022 CHNA Most IPH Sharp Provider Survey respondents believed Sharp does not have programs or services to address the ir issues of concern . Recommendations centered around providing increas ed connection and support, such as : more follow -up calls , home visits, and support for c aregi vers; enabling safe patient visitation during COVID -19; and raising awareness about and expanding available resources . In addition, t he most respondents believed telehealth to be potentially beneficial to patients. IPH Sharp Human Resources Survey respondents emphasized the importance of addressing employee well -being and reducing turnover. Their recommendations focused on improving communication, work -life balance, compensation, new graduate programs and the hiring process. Both surveys indicated that efforts must be made to increase the availability of behavioral health care providers and improve access to behavioral health care. It was also recommended to create more community -based behavioral health programs and offer services in patients' primary languages. Further, respondents from both IPH surveys expressed interest in employee educational opportunities focused on: care for the senior community; defining and applying cultural humility; and implicit/unconsciou s bias and its impact on decision making. Overall, IPH survey f indings suggest that increased support and human connection in health care \u2014 both for patients and staff \u2014 is essential to address the most acute needs experienced by Sharp's community. Similar to the IPH surveys, Sharp Insight Community Survey participants believed telehealth to be beneficial. Participant f eedback also revealed that more c ould be done to promote community awareness about Sharp programs and services among certain populations within SDC. Next Steps HASD&IC 2022 CHNA The CHNA Committee is in the process of planning Phase 2 of the 2022 CHNA, which will include gathering communit y feedback on the 2022 CHNA process and strengthening partnerships around identified community needs. In addition, the CHNA Committee has identified the following priority areas for future research: Updated hospital discharge data : Due to the COVID -19 pandemic and its potential to create temporary anomalies, hospital discharge data covering the years 2017 -2019 was used for this report. The CHNA Committee plans to seek expert assistance and provide the community with updated hospital discharge data from 2020 and 2021. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 15 Substance use: The 2022 community engagement process revealed concerns around increasing substance use for both children and adults but is not sufficiently documented in the most recent trends. Additional information will be collected from community partners. The impact of future/pending changes to programs critical to the health and well - being of our community : Following completion of this re port, there could be significant changes to many health and social support programs that communit y members relied on during the pandemic. The CHNA Committee plan s to assess the impact of these issues as part of the 2022 CHNA Phase 2 community engagement process . Increasing costs and inflation : The CHNA Committee plan s to follow up with community partners about the impact of increasing costs and inflation as part of the 2022 CHNA Phase 2 community engagement process . SMH 2022 CHNA SMH and SMBHWN are committed to the health and well -being of their communit ies, and the findings of the SMH 2022 CHNA will help inform the activities and services provided by the hospitals to improve the health of the community members they serve , especially those dispropor tionately affected by the COVID -19 pandemic. SMH developed the SMH FY 2023 - FY 2026 Implementation Strategy to address the needs identified in the 2022 CHNA for the ir communit ies serve d. Many of the programs included in the implementation strat egy have been in place at SMH and SMBHWN for several years. In addition, SMH and SMBHWN leadership, Sharp HealthCare Community Benefit and team members across Sharp are committed to an ongoing evaluation of the programs provided to address the needs of SMH and SMBHWN 's community members.

Sharp will explore strategies to gather feedback on these needs through future community engagement processes. In addition , as part of Sharp's 2019 CHNA Phase 2 process, the Sharp CHNA Community Guide was developed in response to the 2019 CHNA and is publicly available on -needs -assessments .cfm.The Sharp CHNA Community Guide seeks to provide community members with a user -friendly resource to learn about Sharp's CHNA process and findings, as well as the identified health and social needs addressed through Sharp programs. The Sharp CHNA Commun ity Guide also provides a direct link for community members to provide feedback on Sharp's CHNA. An updated Sharp CHNA Community Guide reflecting the 2022 CHNA will be publicly available on Sharp's website in 2023. Further , Sharp hospitals (including SMH and SMBHWN ), medical groups and health plans will continue advancing data integration and community referral efforts through partnership with 2 -1-1 San Diego's CIE . The CIE includes a l ongitudinal client record with community member history, access to and use of social programs (e.g., housing, food banks, community clinics, etc.), emergency transport data and much more. The CIE also includes a direct -referral feature, which allows for documented, bi -directional, closed -loop referrals between all CIE partner s \u2014 including hospitals, clinics and social service programs. Currently, there are more than 115 community partners (organizations) participating in CIE, and more than 90,000 community members enrolled, with approximately 4,500 new enrollments each month. Sharp is the first integrated health system \u2014 including its hospitals, medical groups and health plan \u2014 to participate in the CIE. By leveraging this technology, and expanding upon this capability for shared data, consistent tracking and robust reporting, the CIE partnership presents an exciting opportunity for Sharp to strengthen and evaluate the impact of clinical - community linkages for its patients and community members in need, particularly regarding SDOH.

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 20 Section 2 History & Background Sharp Memorial Hospital (SMH) is located at 7901 Frost Street in San Diego, ZIP code 92123. Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns ( SMBHWN ) is located at 3003 Health Center Drive in San Diego, ZIP code 92123 . History During the 1950s, San Diego's leadership planted the seeds that would blossom into a vibrant city. The city's population grew more than 30% \u2014 to more than 400,000 people \u2014 and the community's health care needed to change with the times. Rancher and radio communications pioneer Thomas E. Sharp provided the first of several donations from individuals, families and businesses to build the Donald N. Sharp Memorial Community Hospital, in memory of his son, U.S. Army Air Corps Lt. Donald N. Sharp, who was killed in World War II. The hospital was a visionary, comm unity -wide effort to transform health care in San Diego County (SDC). From the beginning, this was a health care organization designed for people, not profit. A major expansion of the SMH campus began immediately after its opening in 1955. This included a heart -lung machine developed jointly by SMH, heart specialists and Convair engineers for use in open -heart surgery; the first major long -term rehabilitation center specializing in care for patients with spinal cord, stroke and brain injuries; and a $1.78 million maternity wing called the \"Stork Club,\" which demonstrated the hospital's commitment to offer state -of-the-art obstetrical and gynecological services to the women of SDC. By its second decade, SMH had become a recognized leader in SDC for cardiac care, rehabilitation and maternity services. Once -dramatic advances like SDC's first implantable pacemaker and first open -heart surgery became commonplace. SMH was the region's newest and most modern hospital, and its destiny was to grow with SDC, becoming the area's most comprehensive health care center. By 1980 \u2014 the year of its silver jubilee \u2014 SMH was providing an extraordinary range of clinical services in facilities that had grown fourfold to meet the community's needs. The hospital would become the cornerstone of today's Sharp HealthCare (Sharp) . As medical science advanced rapidly into the area of high technology, SMH physicians performed the most cardiac catheterizations and cardiac surgeries in the region. The hospital brought the first computeri zed tomography scanner to SDC, and its staff was at Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 21 the forefront of transplantation, using artificial hearts and performing the region's first heart transplant. During the 1980s and 1990s, SMH became the single largest provider of acute care services in SDC. A growing reputation for excellence attracted clinicians and staff from around the world, which continues to this day. In 1985, SMH opened a level II neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which offered an optimal, nurturing environment for babies to gr ow, heal and receive high -quality medical care. By 1986, more than 6,500 babies were born at the hospital each year, including many high -risk premature babies, leading SMH to rank among the best hospitals for obstetric and neonatal care in California and t he nation. In 1989, the Stephen and Mary Birch Foundation donated $5 million to name SDC's first women's hospital after the couple's only daughter, Mary. The campaign for the new women's hospital was Sharp HealthCare Foundation's first -ever fundraising effort, raisin g $15 million for the $46 million hospital. It also marked the transition of women's and maternal services from SMH to the new Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns . SMBHWN officially opened in 1992 and remains SDC's only specialty hospital dedicated exclusively to caring for women and newborns. SMBHWN is proud to deliver almost 8,000 babies annually \u2014 more than nearly any other hospital in California. More than 1,000 of these babies each year are premature or high -risk newborns who require specialized care in the NICU. Additionally, more than 130 babies are transferred from other area hospitals to the SMBHWN NICU each year. The SMBHWN NICU has the capacity to care for up to 84 infants at a time and ranks in the top four centers in the nation for NICU infection prevention. In May 2019, SMBHWN announced that the world's smallest surviving baby had been born at the hospital and cared for in the NICU before being discharged home. Newborns at SMBHWN also benefit from the breakthrough discoveries happening at the hospital's Neonatal Research Institute (NRI). Bringing together a multidisciplinary team of experts, the NRI works to identify and disseminate best practices in newb orn care to improve the outcomes of at -risk infants. Leading -edge discoveries happening at the NRI hold the potential to transform the way newborns are cared for across the country. The Perinatal Special Care Unit at SMBHWN provides expert care for women w ho experience premature labor, or whose pregnancies have been complicated by conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure. The hospital has more affiliated maternal -fetal medicine specialists than any other hospital in San Diego \u2014 including 24/7 in -house coverage for OB -GYN, anesthesia and neonatology \u2014 bringing advanced training and experience to high -risk pregnancies. Women who are admitted to this unit receive specialized treatment in the hospital while they await the delivery of their baby. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 22 SMBHWN also provides a range of women's services specifically tailored to the care and comfort of women. The hospital offers a private unit dedicated exclusively to women's surgery, and expert caregivers specialize in the latest minimally invasive procedures, in cluding robotic gynecologic surgery. Now in its seventh decade, and with the dedication and commitment of more than 1,170 physicians and 3, 700 employees, SMH's leadership looks to the future. As was the case more than a half -century earlier , health care in SDC is in need of dramatic transformation to ensure clinical superiority for the community of tomorrow. On the site where Thomas E. Sharp first pledged a hospital to the memory of his heroic son, stands one of the most modern, technologically advanced and patient -centered care centers in the U.S. In January 2009, SMH opened the Stephen Birch Healthcare Center , which was the first new hospital constructed in San Diego in 15 years. True to its history, the new hospital was the product of its dedicated community, visionary staff and countless financial supporters. Together, they embody the spirit of caring and excellence that has become the legacy of Lt. Donald N. Sharp. The 315,000 -square -foot, 656 -bed facility include s many design elements inspired by the caregivers who work th ere and the philosophy of patient -centered care. Re - designated as a Planetree Patient -Centered Hospital with Distinction for the third time in 2015, SMH is dedicated to providing whole -person care and empowering patients and families through information an d education. The patient -centered experience at SMH includes the Arts for Healing Program, health information ambassadors, integrative healing , spiritual care and interpreter services . The SMH Emergency and Trauma Center is the largest in the county, having increased in size nearly 300 % since its inception. With 52 private patient rooms and four trauma bays, the center was consciously designed to reduce stress and waiting time. SMH's emergency department is nationally rec ognized for the high standard of emergency care it provide s to older adults . The level II trauma center is part of SDC's Trauma System \u2014 a partnership launched in 1984 that includes five other designated trauma centers in the county. SDC's Trauma System is a national leader in organized, efficient and exception al trauma care. SMH continues its tradition as one of the county's largest providers of acute care services and one of the busiest hospitals in SDC. SMH provides outstanding programs in cardiac care , cancer treatment, orthopedics, rehabilitation, bariatric surgery and organ transplantation. SMBHWN specializes in labor and delivery services, high -risk pregnancy, obstetrics, gynecology, gynecologic oncology and neonatal intensive care. For a complete list of the programs and services provided at SMH and SMBHWN , please refer to Appendix A . SMH and SMBHWN are part of Sharp \u2014 an integrated, regional health care delivery system based in San Diego, California. The Sharp system includes four acute care Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 23 hospitals; three specialty hospitals; three affiliated medical groups; 26 medical clinics; five urgent care cente rs; three skilled nursing facilities; two inpatient rehabilitation centers; home health, hospice and home infusion programs; numerous outpatient facilities and programs; three charitable foundations; and a variety of community health education programs and related services. Sharp also offers individual and group health maintenance organization coverage through Sharp Health Plan. Sharp serves a population of approximately 3.3 million in SDC and as of Sept. 30, 2021, is licensed to operate 22,209 beds. It i s Sharp's mission to improve the health of those it serves with a commitment to excellence in all that it does. Sharp's goal is to offer quality care and services that set community standards, exceed patients' expectations and are provided in a caring, con venient, cost -effective and accessible manner. More than 2,700 affiliated physicians and 19,000 employees are dedicated to providing the extraordinary level of care that is called The Sharp Experience. Please refer to Appendix B for a detailed overview of the Sharp system. Background: Sharp Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) For more than 20 years, Sharp has been actively involved in a triennial CHNA process. This process began in 1995, in accordance with the requirements of Senate Bill 697 (SB 697), community benefit legislation that requires not -for-profit hospitals in Calif ornia to file a triennial CHNA that identifies community health needs. Further, t he Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment ( SMH 2022 CHNA) responds to more recent Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulatory requirements that private n ot-for-profit hospitals conduct and make publicly available a triennial CHNA and corresponding implementation strategy. The implementation strategy identifies and details current or planned strategies intended to address the needs identified in the hospita l's CHNA. SB 697 also requires submission of an annual community benefit report to the California Department of Health Care Access and Information2 that describes programs and services provided to address those identified community health needs within their mission and financial capacity, as well as the financial value of those programs and services. To view the most recent Sharp HealthCare Communi ty Benefit Plan and Report, please visit: http://www.sharp.com/about/community/community -benefits -health - needs.cfm . participated in a cou ntywide collaborative that included a broad range of hospitals, health care organizations and community agencies to conduct a triennial CHNA. Findings from the CHNA, the program and services expertise of each Sharp hospital , and knowledge of the population s and communities served by those hospitals provide a foundation for community benefit programs and implementation strategies. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 24 With the passing of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010 , since 2013 Sharp has participated in a countywide CH NA effort under the auspices of the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC). Through the CHNA Committee , Sharp partners with other San Diego hospitals and health systems on this countywide CHNA , which significantly informs both the process and findings for the CHNAs that are completed for each Sharp hospital. Although only not -for-profit 501(c)(3) hospitals and health systems are subject to state and IRS regulatory requirements, the 2022 CHNA Committee includes hospitals and health systems who are not subject to any CHNA requirements, but who are deeply engaged in the communities they serve and committed to the goals of a collaborative CHNA. CHNA Governance The HASD&IC Board represents all member sectors and provides policy direction to ensure the interests of member hospitals and health systems are preserve d and promoted. The CHNA Advisory Workgroup includes representatives from every participating hospital and health system and provides overarching guidance regarding the research approach and community engagement. The CHNA Committee works closely with the C HNA Advisory Workgroup and reports to HASD&IC Board of Directors. The CHNA Committee is responsible for implementing the San Diego CHNAs. Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment (HASD&IC 2019 CHNA ) The HASD&IC 2019 CHNA was completed in July 2019 . Figure 5 below summarizes the findings of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA . The highest priority community health needs in SDC (in alphabetical order by social determinant of health [SDOH] or health condition) can b e found at the center. The figure illustrates the interactive nature of SDOH and health conditions \u2014 each impacting the other. In addition to the top community health needs identified, the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA findings described the underlying theme of stigma and the barriers it created. The complete HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Sharp Memorial Health Needs Assessment 25 Figure 5: HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Findings - Top 10 Community Health Needs Following the completion of the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA , the CHNA Committee conducted a Phase 2 effort which included a survey for community -based organizations (CBO) , hospitals and health systems, and other community stakeholders to gather feedback on the 2019 CHNA findings.9 Distributed between February and March 2020, the survey was designed to: ensure that the findings of th e 2019 CHNA were accurate; understand how stigma affects health; and frequently explore recurring themes that emerged during community discussions, including access to health care, immigration, and public charge. See Appendix C for more information about the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Phase 2 process including a summary of participation and key survey questions and response s. In addition, the CHNA Committee reviewed all data from the HASD&IC 2019 CHNA in accordance with their own patient communities, determined their capacity to address the identified community needs, and evaluated opportunities for next steps. This process guided the development of Sharp's implementation str ategies, which detail the programs, services and collaborations designed to address identified community health needs. Sharp hospital implementation strategies are updated annually and are available to the public on sharp.com at: https://www.sharp.com/about/community/community - benefits/health -needs -assessments.cfm . 9 The H ospital Association of San Diego & Imperial Counties 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment ( HASD&IC 2019 CHNA ) Phase 2 Survey was developed and disseminated before the COVID -19 pandemic took hold in our region. The CHNA Committee recognizes that communities facing inequities are experiencing unprecedented challenges, and the devastating increase in need s is not ca ptured in our 2019 Phase 2 findings. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 26 Notable implementation strategies and program developments for SMH and SMBHWN since the comp letion of the SMH 2019 CHNA are described in Table 6 below.

In addition, in 2020 Sharp incorporated its 2019 CHNA findings into an updated Sharp CHNA Community Guide. The guide provides community members with a user -friendly document describing Sharp's CHNA process and findings, as well as strategies Sharp implements to address i dentified health and social needs. In addition, the guide includes a direct link for community members to provide feedback on Sharp's CHNA process. Please refer to Appendix G for the 2019 Sharp CHNA Community Guide. In early -to mid-2023, an updated Sharp CHNA Community Guide will be publicly available at: https://www.sharp.com/about/community/comm unity -benefits/health -needs - assessments.cfm . Findings from both the Sharp and HASD&IC 2019 CHNA Phase 2 efforts provided essential guidance for the Sharp (including SMH and SMBHWN ) and HASD&IC 2022 CHNAs, the processes and findings of which are detailed in the following pages. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 30 Section 3 Methodology The Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment ( SMH 2022 CHNA) draws from and is based on the process and findings of the collaborative Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (HASD&IC 2022 CHNA). Sharp HealthCare (Sharp ) served as chair of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA Committee and has actively participated in and collaborated on the HASD&IC -led CHNA process since 2012. The 2022 CHNA community engagement process effectively began upon completion of the 2019 CHNA in Fall 2019. However, the formal HASD&IC 2022 CHNA contract and process began in late Spring 2020 and concluded in Summer 2022. Complete details of the methodology and findings of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA process included additional strategic analysis of internal hospital and clinic data to explore observations and trends among Sharp's patient population, particularly related to the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic. Sharp also conducted distinct patient, staff and community member engagement activities in order to further explore the specific health and equity needs of the communit ies served by SMH and SMBHWN . As such, this section will include details of the SMH 2022 CHNA methods and, where applicable, elements of the collaborative HASD&IC 2022 CHNA process. Based on the findings of the 2019 CHNA and recommendations from the community, the SMH and HASD&IC 2022 CHNA processes sought to provide a deeper understanding of barriers to health improvement in San Diego County (SDC) and to inform and guide local hospitals in the development of their programs and strategies that address identified commun ity health needs. These processes also respond to IRS regulatory requirements that require tax -exempt hospitals to conduct a health needs assessment in the community once every three years. With these goals in mind, the 2022 CHNAs were specifically designe d to: build on and strengthen community partnerships established through the 2019 CHNA processes; obtain deeper feedback from and about communities facing inequities in SDC, with a special focus on the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic; and align with nation al best practices around CHNA development and implementation. The 2022 CHNA processes included analyses of community -identified health conditions as well as socioeconomic barriers that contribute to health inequity. The latter focus supports the understa nding that the burden of illness, premature death and disability disproportionately affects minority population groups and other underserved community members. Knowledge of regional and population -specific differences is an important factor in understandin g and strategizing ways to effectively impact the health of our community. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 31 Methodology Overview HASD&IC 2022 CHNA The CHNA Committee completed an extensive review of national best practices and evidence -based frameworks to develop a research approach t o health equity. The purpose of this effort was to address the historical, systemic and social drivers disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations , including people of color, socially disadvantaged groups and those living in poverty. Figure 6 details the health equity framework adopted by the CHNA Committee to help guide collective research, analysis and community engagement. San Diego hospitals, health systems and health districts are committed to a CHNA process that reflects the shared values outlined in th is framework. Figure 6: HASD&IC 2022 CHNA Health Equity Framework Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 32 Research Methods and Approach To gain a deep and meaningful understanding of the health -related needs of SDC residents, two primary methods were employed in the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA: 1. Quantitative analyses were conducted of existing publicly available data to provide an overarching view of critical health issues across SDC. 2. Qualitative information was gathered from community residents, community - based organizations (CBOs) , federally qu alified health centers (FQHCs), hospitals and health systems, local government agencies, civic leaders, grantmaking organizations and San Diego County Public Health Services through a comprehensive community engagement process to understand the lived exper iences and needs of people in the community. The CHNA Committee reviewed the feedback and data to prioritize the top health needs in SDC. Please see Figure 7 below for more information on the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA process. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 33 Figure 7: HASD&IC 2022 CHNA - Process Map Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 34 SMH 2022 CHNA Guided by the same rationale, the SMH 2022 CHNA process also further explored the health and equity issues identified in the SMH 2019 CHNA. The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA process provided the for SMH 2022 CHNA, with additional Sharp -specific data analys es and community engagement activities completing the SMH 2022 CHNA process. Quantitative and qualitative data methods for both the HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs are described within this section. Quantitative Data HASD&IC 2022 CHNA Quantitative data were used for three primary purposes: 1. Describe the SDC comm unity 2. Plan and design the community engagement process 3. Facilitate the \"prioritization process ,\" identifying the most serious community health needs of SDC residents facing inequities Quantitative data include: California's Department of Health C are Access and Information (HCAI) limited data sets, 2017 -2019 SpeedTrack\u00a95 Community Need Index (CNI)4 Public Health Alliance of Southern California Healthy Places Index (HPI) National and state data sets including SDC mortality and morbidity data and data related to SDOH The HPI and CNI wer e used to identify the most under -resourced communities. This information helped guide the community engagement process, including selecting communities from which to solicit input and developing relevant and meaningful topics and questions. The following reports and dashboards from the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) were also used : County of San Diego Community Health Statistics Health Disparities Executive Summary Report6 Racial Equity: Framework and Outcomes Brief Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) Health Equity Dashboard Series: Racial Equity Dashboards San Diego County Self - Sufficiency Standard Dashboard COVID -19 in San Diego County Dashboard Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 33 San Diego County Self- Sufficiency Standard, Household with Two Adults, One Preschool Age Child and One School -Age Child, 2021 LGBTQ+ Health and Well -Being Dashboard SpeedTrack 's California Universal Patient Information Discovery, or CUPID application, was used to export emergency department (ED) and inpatient hospital discharge data. These data were analyzed to determine the most common primary diagnosis categories upon dischar ge. This analysis helped the CHNA Committee understand which health conditions have the greatest impact on hospitals and health systems, providing further insight into priority health needs. For health conditions identified as a high priority for the CHNA, full datasets were extracted and stratified by age and race. Rates were calculated for each group and for each condition per 100,000 in the population. Overall three -year trends (2017 -2019) were also calculated for each health condition, as well as for e ach age group and race/ethnicity within each health condition. This stratification shed light on disparities in SDC. SMH support SMH 's 2022 CHNA process, Sharp's Clinical Analytics team developed a detailed analysis to investigate key questions and issues related to the health and well - being of Sharp's patient population and the wider SDC community. Data used in this analysis came from a variety of sources, including the Cerner Millennium electronic medical record, hospital and clinic claims data, managed care enrollment and clinical registries. In addition, key service line stakeholders in behavioral health and oncology, along with Sha rp's Emergency Department Collaborative and Clinical Effectiveness department, were engaged in the data analytics planning process to ensure the accuracy of various data sources and metrics. Patients included in the analysis had an inpatient discharge or c linic visit at a Sharp facility between calendar year 2016 and 2021 (CY 2016 and 2021) . A five -year time period was chosen specifically to analyze trends prior to and during the COVID -19 pandemic. Please refer to Appendix H for the complete Sharp -specific data analysis conducted by Sharp's Clinical Analytics team for the SMH 2022 CHNA. SpeedTrack's CUPID application was used to analyze HCAI hospital discharge data, which provided insight on SMH and SMBHWN 's patient population s related to specific identified health needs. SMH and SMBHWN used the most recent year of available data (CY 2020) to identify top diagnoses, trends , and demographic characteristics, such as age, gender , and race/ethnicity, among both inpatients and individuals who visited the ED at SMH . The information generated by this analysis reinforce d key themes identified in the Sharp and HASD&IC 2022 CHNA processes. In addition, SMH and SMBHWN used the CNI to id entify the communities in their service area s experiencing health inequities. This included overlaying hospital discharge data for behavioral health, cancer, cardiovascular disease , COVID -19 and Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 36 Type 2 diabetes on top of CNI data to analyze the connection between these specific health conditions and under -resourced communities in SDC. This information will further assist in the development of SMH and SMBHWN programs to meet community needs in the areas of greatest disparity and inequity. Please refer to Section 4: Community Defined for additional detail on SMH and SMBHWN 's application of CNI data. Qualitative Data: Community Engagement Activities HASD&IC 2022 CHNA The goal of the community engagement process was to solicit input from a wide range of stakeholders so that the sample was as representative as possible of those facing inequities in SDC. Special efforts were made to include community members from groups that experience health disparities and service pro viders who work with those vulnerable populations. A total of 841 individuals participated in the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA. The f ollowing steps were taken to ensure community members' experiences were included: Working with community health workers (CHWs) to conduct interviews with community members Conducting focus groups and key informant interviews with community members, CHWs, CBOs , service providers, civic leaders and health care leaders (conducted in colla boration with Kaiser Foundation Hospital -San Diego)10 Conducting focus groups and key informant interviews with hospital and health system clinicians, case managers, social workers and executive leaders Distributing an online survey to community members, h ospital staff, CBOs , FQHCs and local government staff The CHNA Committee worked with community partners to plan community engagement activities with stakeholders representing every region of SDC and all age groups. In addition, the CHNA Committee explicit ly sought to engage a wide variety of stakeholders representing a divers ity of racial and ethnic groups. See Figure 8 below for a summary of participation in the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement interviews, focus groups and online survey . Additional participant descriptions are available in Community Health Needs Assessment ( CHNA ) process, Kaiser Foundation Hospital (KFH) -San Diego and Zion conducted a separate CHNA process consisting of quantitative and qualitative data collection. The qualitative data collection was conducted simultaneously with ongoing, continuous feedback between the two groups about the process; this allowed the groups' efforts to be complementary rather than duplicative. These efforts also enabled Hospital Association of San Diego & I mperial Counties (HASD&IC ) and KFH -San Diego and Zion to leverage each other's relationships in the community, resulting in greater community representation and the efficient use of resources. Select data were shared betw een the groups. This innovative and effective partnership resulted in a more robust CHNA for all San Diego County hospitals and health care system s. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 37 Figure 8: HASD&IC 2022 CHNA - Summary of Community Engagement Participation Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 38 Key Informant Interviews and Focus Groups Key informant interviews and focus groups were conducted between October 2021 and April 2022 to identify and explore priority health needs, S DOH, barriers to care and community assets and resources. Interviewers and facilitators asked questions developed and approved by the CHNA Committee to generate discussion about specific community health needs, as well as open -ended questions for broader d iscussions. Broad questions about health conditions and SDOH were asked at the beginning of each discussion, followed by more specific , targeted questions. Questions varied depending on the expertise and/or specific interests of the person or group partici pating in each interview or focus group. Focus groups and interviews were conducted via Zoom. Incentives, in the form of gift cards, were also provided when the groups were composed of community residents. Each interview and focus group began with a discu ssion about the purpose and process of the CHNA. The interviewer obtained verbal and visual consent to proceed (and, in some cases, record) and assured participants that their participation was voluntary and all feedback would be anonymous. Interpretative and translation services were arranged for any group that requested them. One focus group was conducted in Spanish by a facilitator through simultaneous English and Spanish interpretation. Online Community Survey The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA online community survey was used to support prioritization of health conditions and SDOH based on what survey respondents viewed as the most important or most serious challenges. The survey was distributed by email to targeted CBOs , social service providers, resident -led organizations, FQHCs, government agencies, grantmaking organizations and hospitals and health systems that serve a diverse array of people in SDC. When possible, these organizations shared the link to the surve y with the clients they served. Email recipients were also encouraged to share the survey with their colleagues. Open from Feb ruary 14 to March 30, 2022 , the survey was also widely shared through social media and email and reshared by CBOs . The survey wa s translated from English into five additional languages: Arabic, Spanish, Somali, Tagalog and Vietnamese. Mid-City CAN , a CBO located in City Heights, was contracted to complete the translations. Promotoras and CHW O utreach and Feedback Research partners at the Institute for Public Health at San Diego State University (IPH) facilitated two focus groups with CHWs. The IPH conducted both focus groups through Zoom. All focus group participants were CHWs working for a COVID -19 contact tracing program. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 39 Focus group participants were recruited through multiple avenues, including announcements in the County of San Diego HHSA's Community Health Worker Collaborative Newsletter, disseminated by the County of San Diego to provide updates on COVID -19 Communication and Outreach Services to the individuals working on one of the County 's COVID -19 contracts. In addition, emails were disseminated directly to all CHWs working on the Communities Fighting COVID ! Project11 at San Diego State University . Emails were sent to the leads on eight different County COVID -19 contracts, requesting that they disseminate the information to their CHWs or outreach workers. The announcement included an interest form that asked for the person's contact information, day of the week and time of day that worked best for them, type of gift card they would like to receive as a thank you , and a brief description of the type of work they currently do. Focus group participants were asked open -ended questions a bout identifying specific health conditions of concern, inequities in the community , and the needs of youth and seniors. Gift cards were emailed two days after the focus group as a thank you to all participants. In addition, to ensure the report included direct community member feedback from racial and ethnic groups experiencing disparate health outcomes, the CHNA Committee employed a new strategy to partner with CBOs that work with promotoras and other CHWs. For this process, t he HASD&IC 2022 CHNA online community survey was adapted with a subset of the survey questions for use as a data collection tool. The San Diego Refugee Communities Coalition and the Chicano Federation were selected to recruit interested promotoras and other CHWs to conduct the interviews. HASD&IC staff attended a San Diego Refugee Communities Coalition weekly CHW meeting to provide training on the goals of the CHNA and how to administer the interview. HASD&IC staff also provided training to the Chicano Federat ion promotoras. The p romotoras and other CHWs conducted the interviews either in person or over the phone. Interviewers asked open -ended questions about health and social needs, access to care challenges , and what hospitals could do to improve the health and well - being of the community. Interviewers then coded responses and input them in an online data collection tool. Price Philanthropies Foundation generously provided grants to both organizations to compensate the promotoras and other CHWs for comple ting interviews. SMH 2022 CHNA In addition to serving on the CHNA Committee in support of the collaborative HASD&IC 2022 CHNA process, Sharp conducted community engagement activities specifically for the community members it serves. The purpose of the Sharp (including SMH and 11 San Diego State University School of Public Health & I nstitute of Public Health (2021), Communities Fighting COVID! Project. https://cfc.sdsu.edu Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 40 SMBHWN ) 2022 CHNA community engagement activities was to gather feed back on the health and equity issues that were identified in Sharp's 2019 CHNA, including the impact of COVID -19 on those issues. Sharp solicited community input through three electronic surveys: 1. A survey for select Sharp health care pro viders , particula rly professionals who serve patients with health equity challenges. 2. A survey for Sharp human resources (HR) professionals to capture the interests and experiences of Sharp team members impacted by health and equity challenges. 3. A survey using the Sharp Insi ght Community to represent current and former Sharp patients (or their families and caregivers), some Sharp -affiliated physicians and community members unaffiliated with Sharp. The first two surveys were conducted in contract with the IPH to collect feedb ack related to Sharp patients and employees . Specific objectives of these surveys included: Gather feedback to better understand the most significant health and equity issues impacting community members served by Sharp, as well as the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on those issues. Collect insight to improve awareness and knowledge of how the COVID -19 pandemic has also impacted the health and well -being of Sharp health care professionals. Identify opportunities for internal and external collaboration to provide new, innovative programs that address the health and equity issues identified by Sharp patients, health care professionals and community members. Identify areas for improvement to current patient and community programs in order to better address h ealth and equity issues for San Diegans. The third survey was implemented in partnership with Sharp's Consumer Research team. The survey was distributed to the Sharp Insight Community \u2014 a private , online environment for Sharp patients and their families and caregivers , community members and Sharp -affiliated physicians and staff \u2014 to gather input on participants' experiences both at Sharp and within their own communities. Specific objectives of this survey included: Obtain feedback from community members on the identified health and equity issues experienced by San Diegans, including the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on those issues. Collect suggestions from community members about how Sharp may improve the health and well -being of the patients and communities it serves.

Table 8: Data Used in HASD&IC 2022 CHNA Prioritization Process Data Used in Prioritization Process Quantitative Data Qualitative Data Data and analysis from HHSA , Public Health Services including Community Health Statistics, Health Equity Dashboards, Morbidity & Mortality Data Analysis of secondary data, health conditions and SDOH County of San Diego leading causes of death 2019 data Hospital discharge trend data retrieved from HCAI limited data sets, 2017 -2019 SpeedTrack\u00a9 Community guidance from CHNA planning interviews Community engagement findings from focus groups Community engagement findings from key informant interviews Community engagement findings from interviews and focus groups with promotoras and CHWs 2022 CHNA online community survey The CHNA Committee used the following set of criteria in their prioritization process : Severity of need: This refers to how severe the health need is (such as its potential to cause death or disability) and its degree of poor performance against the relevant benchmark. Magnitude/scale of the need: The magnitude refers to the number of peopl e affected by the health need. Disparities or inequities: This refers to differences in health outcomes by subgroups, which may be based on geography, languages, ethnicity, culture, citizenship status, economic status, sexual orientation, age, gender or ot her factors. Change over time: This refers to whether or not the need has improved, stayed the same or worsened. Over the course of several meetings, the CHNA Committee collectively reviewed the quantitative and qualitative data and findings. The CHNA Com mittee discussed and considered each health condition and SDOH for which data was available. Those health Prioritization Criteria Severity of NeedMagnitude/ scale of the need Disparities or inequitiesChange over time Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 43 conditions and SDOH that met the largest number of criteria were chosen as top priorities. SMH 2022 CHNA As the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA process included robust representation from the communities served by SMH and SMBHWN , this prioritization process was replicated Findings from the SMH 2022 CHNA prioritization process and analysis of identifi ed health and equity needs are summarized in Section 5: Findings . 2022 CHNA Data Limitations and Information Gaps Limitations of the 2022 CHNA processes for both the SMH and collaborative HASD&IC CHNA effort s are d iscussed here to potentially benefit future CHNA processes and reports. Conducting a CHNA during a pandemic brought challenges to both planning and implementation. Community partners no longer met in person and new strategies were needed to maintain connections with residents and CBOs . In addition, the needs of the community e volved from the initial shutdown in March 2020 to when CHNA community engagement activities occurred in late 2021 and early 2022. Every effort was made to capture current sentiment even as the needs of the community change d. Although the intensity of certain needs may have varied over time, the key findings remained clear and consistent throughout the community engagement efforts. As with any CHNA process, the da ta available for use are limited. Much of the quantitative data included in both the HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNA processes were based on several different sources at the state and county level, often over different time periods that were not current to 2022. For example, at the time the report was created, the most recent period available for HCAI hospital discharge data was 2020, while the most recent statistics from the County's Community Health Statistics Unit were from 2019. More current data from these s ources (2021 and 2020, respectively) will not be available until later in 2022 . Qualitative data collected for the CHNA also has limitations . The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA process included approximately 840 participants in its community engagement processes, whil e the SMH 2022 CHNA process engaged nearly 730 participants, including over 600 residents/patients. Every effort was made to obtain community input from the populations who experience the greatest health inequities. Community participation from these group s was strong; however, participants included only those community members who were interested and able to engage in the process. Population and disease -specific key informant interviews also presented limitations in that the y may not have captured all of the challenges faced by the groups represented . Further , most respondents of the Sharp Insight Community Survey were female, age 55 or older, and white/Caucasian. Panel demographics for this particular survey likely Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 44 resulted in responses that were not fully representative of the diverse populations that reside in SDC. In addition , limitations existed related to the distribution and collection of the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA electronic community engagement surveys. These were distrib uted through those CBOs who were able to share the survey with their clients , as these partners had access to direct contact information . The response from community residents to the survey was low due to a limited pool of contact information . In addition, while there was representation from all regions and ethnicities based on the participants who completed these surveys, smaller sample sizes among certain groups may limit its generalizability to subsections of the population Further, the design of the community engagement surveys for Sharp's 2022 CHNA provided limited opportunity for feedback on certain needs that were identified through the collaborative HASD&IC 2022 CHNA. As a result, findings on these needs are only described in thi s report based on participant feedback from the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 45 Section 4 Community Defined Although Sharp Memorial Hospital (SMH) and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns (SMBHWN) serve the entire county of San Diego, the primary communities served by the hospitals include the city of San Diego, Chula Vista, the East County area, and t he North Inland communities surrounding Rancho Pe \u00f1asquitos. See Table 9 and Figure 9 for a lis t and map of where the majority of SMH and SMBHWN patients reside. For a map of community and region boundaries in SDC overall , please refer to Appendix K.

Feedback on community health needs was solicited from both community members and service providers living and working throughout SDC to assess priority health issues for the community. 12 Map created by Sharp HealthCare (Sharp) Strategic Planning Department (Feb. 2022). Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 47 Demographics13 In this section, SMH and SMBHWN 's communit ies are defined not only by their demographic makeup but also by health equity14 metrics known to contribute to health care access and health outcomes. Wherever possible, the following descriptions will focus on primary communities served by SMH and SMBHWN (e.g. their combined service area, as defined in previous pages) . However, wh ere secondary data sources are not available at this level of specificity, broader summaries of SDC are provided . In the next five years, SMH and SMBHWN 's combined service area is projected to grow 1.7%, slightly slower than the projected growth of SDC as a whole (1.8%). The two fastest growing ZIP codes in SMH and SMBHWN's service area are Chula Vista (91911) and San Carlos (92119) , as shown in Table 10.15 Table 10: Fastest Growing ZIP Codes in SMH and SMBHWN 's Service Area, 2022 -202715 ZIP Code Name into six regions extending 4,205 square miles from the southern borders of Orange and Riverside Counties to the border between Mexico and the U.S. With a population of more than 3 million people, San Diego is the second largest county in California and the fifth -most populous in the U.S. The region includes 18 incorporated cities and expansive unincorporated areas . The population is predominately white (45.6%), Hispanic or Latino16 (33.7%) and Asian/Pacific Islander (API)17 (11.6%).18,19 13 Portions of this section were sourced from the H ospital Association of San Diego & Imperial Counties 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment ( HASD&IC 2022 CHNA ). Primary sources used by HASD&IC to develop this material are cited throughout. 14 According to the World Health Organization (WHO), equity is the absence of unfair, avoidable or remediable differences among groups of people, whether those groups are defined socially, economically, demographically or geographically or by other dimension s of inequality (e.g., sex, gender, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation). Health is a fundamental human right. Health equity is achieved when everyone can attain their full potential for health and well -being (WHO, 2022). 15 Speedtrack, Inc.; U.S. Census Bureau. 16 Latino includes individuals and communities from Mexico, Central and South America, and the Caribbean. 17 Asian/Pacific Islander, API or AAPI, refers to people from East Asia, Southeast Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, Hawaii, Samoa, Guam, Fiji, and other South Pacific Islands or to describe people of Asian/Pacific Islander descent. 18 Unfortunately, because of how the Census data are collected, we do not clearly understand how many San Diegans are Middle Eastern, African, or Southeast Asi an. This information is critical to understanding the needs of San Diego's diverse communities. 19 County of San Diego HHSA, Public Health Services (PHS), Community Health Statistics Unit (CHSU) (2021), Demographic Profiles, 2019; U.S. Census Bureau, Americ an Community Survey 2015 -2019 . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 48 In 2022, there were 331,099 residents ages 65 and older in the SMH and SMBHWN combined service area, representing 15.0% of its population. Between 2022 and 2027, the service area's senior populati on is projected to grow by 14.7%.15 In 2019, the majority of households in SDC (62.4%) reported that the primary language spoken at home was Engl ish only. Among households who reported speaking English \"less than very well,\" 8.6% primarily spoke Spanish, 3.4% primarily spoke an API17 languag e and 1.7% spoke another language. As of 2019, 12.6% of SDC's population ages 25 and older had no high school diploma (or equivalent).19 Please see Table 11 and Figure 10 for more SDC demographic data.

An estimated 20,000 Native Americans reside in SDC, with only a small pe rcentage living on reservation land.20 According to the 2020 Census, foreign -born individuals make up nearly a quarter (23%) of SDC's population.21 California has the largest share of children in immigrant families nationwide (46%) and just 5% of California children are foreign -born.22 Currently, 87% of SDC's foreign -born population comes from countries in Latin America (44%) and Asia (43%).23 SDC's immigrant population has shifted over the past five years, with the fastest -growing population coming from five Middle Eastern and African countries, including Kenya, Iraq, Nigeria, Sudan and Syria.24 Fear persists among these foreign - born communities amid xenophobia and anti -immigrant political rhetoric.25 For nearly a decade, no county in California has received more refugees than SDC, according to state and federal data. Many refugees are assigned to San Diego because of the presence of four resettlement agencies and the existence of multiple established immigrant communities in the area. Of the new refugees that arrived in California between 2009 and 2017, 40% resettled in SDC. In 2021 alone, more than 3,700 refugees arrived in SDC.26 20 San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG), Tribal Governments . 21 Foreign -born refers to anyone who is not a U.S. citizen at birth, including persons who have become U.S. citizens through naturalization. 22 The Annie E.

There are over 143,000 active -duty personnel in SDC \u2014 a figure that is expected to increase to over 160,000 by 2025. Veterans account for nearly 1 in 10 adults (240,000) in SDC.32 Veterans have a unique source of health care available through the U.S. Depa rtment of Veterans A ffairs ; however, it is not universally available to all veterans and their families and many who qualify do not apply. In recent years, the number of uninsured veterans has continued to decline , though a number of veterans remain uninsu red.33 The Department of Defense faces significant challenges ensuring that all members of the military and their families receive proper health care for everything from general health and well -being to specialized clinical care for deployment -related cond itions.34 There are approximately two dozen post -secondary educational institutions in SDC, which enroll students from throughout San Diego, California, the U.S. and the world. Like non -local college students, most military families live in SDC for a lim ited time. Military families relocate 10 times more often than civilian families, moving every two to three years on average.35 The significant presence of college students and military -connected individuals and families means that a substantial portion of SDC's population resides in the area for less than five years. These populations share challenges similar to other San Diegans, 27 San Diego Refugee Communities Coalition (2020), COVID -19 Refugee Community Impact Report; SDSU and CommuniVax Coalition (2021) , Addressing COVID -19 Vaccination Equity and Recovery Among the His panic/Latino Population in the Southern California Border Region . 28 Food security means access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life. https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food -nutrition the Pandemic Unaccompanied Child Arrivals Increase . 30 Unaccompanied children are under 18 years of age, have no legal immigration status and arrive in the U.S. without a parent or legal guardian to provide care and custody. Most of these children come from Central America. These children are especially vulnerable to trafficking and criminal predation. 31 San Diego Union -Tribune (2021). 32 San Diego Military Adviso ry Council (2019), San Diego Military Economic Impact Study . 33 U.S. Census Bureau (2017), Health Insurance Coverage of Veterans . 34 The RAND Corporation, The Military and Health Care. 35 The Soldier Project (2022), How Often Do Military Families Move?

Nationally, Blue Star Families found that only 23% of active -duty family respondents had access to appropriate childcare , and 14% of enlisted respondents were food insecure.36 In 2019, more than half of California community college students reported difficulty affording balanced meals or concerns about running out of food, and nearly 1 in 5 were experiencing homelessness or lacked a stable place to live .37 Another transitiona l population in SDC are farmworkers. The National Center for Farmworker Health (NCFH) reports that there are over 14,200 agricultural workers in the county, many of whom are migratory or seasonal.38,39 Migratory families in SDC include an estimated 4,000 children and youth.40 NCFH also reports that agricultural workers suffer higher rates of infectious disease, tuberculosis, parasitic infection and diarrhea than the general population. Occupational haza rds are also attributed to higher instances of respiratory issues, which are often caused by exposure to fungi, dust and pesticides.41 Geography13 According to San Diego Association of Governments ( SANDAG ), over three -quarters (76%) of SDC's land is rural and the remainder is urban. The majority of county residents live in metropolitan San Diego. While urban and rural communities face many of the same challenges \u2014 including food insecurity and affordable housing \u2014 individuals in rural communities may have fewer resources available or may need to travel greater distances to access them. Access to reliable internet is a unique challenge in rural areas. Less than half of SDC's rural population has fixed internet compared to 97% of residents in urban areas.42 The California -Mexico border region includes San Diego and Imperial counties and northern Baja California, Mexico. The transnational region is home to more than 7 million people. The San Diego Workforce Partnership estimates that more than 90 million people cross the border each year, making it the busiest land -border crossing in the wo rld. Over 10,000 students and nearly 50,000 workers live on one side of the border and go to work or school on the other.43 For many San Diegans, Mexico's border cities provide access to affordable medical and dental care, as well as housing. As a place wh ere many people with varying cultural, economic and political characteristics interact, the border region is particularly vulnerable to the spread of infectious diseases. 36 Blue Star Families, 2020 Military Family Lifestyle Survey Comprehensive Report . 37 California Community Colleges (2019), #RealCollege Survey . 38 Migratory workers and their families use temporary housing as they follow the different crop harvests, while season al workers live locally but may experience changes in their tasks, hours or income at work. 39 National Center for Farmworker Health (NCFH) , Tableau Agricultural Worker Estimates 2017. 40 San Diego County Office of Education (2022). 41 NCFH (2020), A Profile of Migrant Health . 42 SANDAG (2020) , San Diego Forward: Vision for the 2021 Regional Plan . 43 San Diego Workforce Partnership (2022) , Border Relations of the CaliBaja Region & Impacts on our Economy . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 52 Controlling infectious diseases in the border region requires international collabora tion and communication.44 San Diego and Imperial counties are Southern Border Counties (SBC) sharing the U.S. - Mexico border. Although geographically close, their differences present unique challenges and opportunities. For this reason, several independen t civic and government entities from each county work closely together, including the workforce development boards and metropolitan planning organizations. In addition, there are nonprofit and philanthropic associations that serve the entire SBC region. Ho spitals collaborate daily with patients traveling through the geographically dispersed rural Mountain Empire communities at or near the county line . Cross -county collaboration has been especially critical for coordinating a regional public health response and managing surges throughout the COVID -19 pandemic. Economic Characteristics13 According to the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation (SD REDC), small businesses (those with fewer than 100 employees) represent more than 98% of all firms in SDC and 60% of t he region's total employment. Because they are often less financially stable than larger organizations, small business wages are 14% lower than the average.45 In addition, small businesses often provide fewer benefits and limited career mobility to their e mployees. The COVID -19 pandemic resulted in the closure of 1 in 3 small businesses across the county. In July 2020 , SANDAG reported that the pandemic had negatively impacted 9 in 10 small businesses.42 Cost of Living Barriers SDREDC reports that it is 47% more expensive to live in SDC than the average U.S. metro area, and the area's median home price is the fifth -highest nationwide.45 Just 39% of San Diegans earn wages that can keep up with the region's rapidly rising cost of living.46 When housing costs are considered, SDC's overa ll poverty rate rises from 13% to 20%.47 Adding to this burden, just 7% of low -income residents have access to fast and frequent transit services. The median transit travel time is 51 minutes \u2014 double the average commute time for people who drive to work.42 In 2019, 11.6% of the SDC population reported living below 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The county's unemployment rate was 5.7% (see Table 12 for details). In addition, in 2019, 5.0% of households in SDC received Supplemental Security Income .19 44 Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (2018), Workshop Summary: Infectious Disease Prioritization for Multijurisdictional Engagement at the United States Southern Border Region; Binational Border Health (2019) , Border Health Status Report to the Legislature . 45 San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation (2022), Inclusive Growth Initiative . 46 Circulate San Diego (2021) , Community Voices: Community Input to the 2020 -2021 Community Action Partnership Needs Assessment . 47 California Housing Partnership Corporation (2018) , San Diego County's Housing Emergency & Proposed Solutions .

In 2019, approximately one -quarter of people in SDC were nutrition insecure \u2014 including 44% of Hispanic or Latino individuals . Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, the percent of SDC's population experiencing n utrition insecurity increased to a peak of 39% (1.3 million people) in April 2020, then leveled off to 30% ( 1 million people) in November 2020. As of June 2021, nutrition insecurity continued to affect nearly 1 in 3 SDC residents.49 Children and youth un der the age of 18 make up nearly one-quarter of SDC 's population , and nearly 1 in 6 children are living below 100% of the FPL.50 See Tables 13 and 14 for additional details about children and poverty in SDC.

Nutrition security builds on food security by focusing on how the quality of our diets can help reduce diet -related diseases. It also emphasizes equity and tackling long -standing health disparities. https://www.usda.gov/nutrition -security. 49 San Diego Hunger Coalition (2021), Hunger Free San Diego Issue Brief: The State of Nutrition Security in San Diego County: Before, during and beyond the COVID -19 Crisis . 50 U.S. Census Bureau, 2019 American Community Survey one -year estimates.

A type of HRSA is a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA ). HPSA is defined as a geographic area, population group, or health care facility that has been designated by the HRSA as having a shortage of health professionals.

This underscores the importance of SMH's commitment to programs that help to educate, screen and prevent the incidence of cancer, as well as to programs that offer support and resources for community members impacted by cancer. Identifying SMH and SMBHWN 's High -Need Areas Identifying specific geographic areas with health inequities59 is critical to understanding community health. SMH and S MBHWN used a specific metric to determine communities within their service area that experience greater health inequities: the Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health Community Need Index (CNI). The CNI uses demographic and economic statistics to provide a \"CNI score\" for every populated ZIP code in the U.S. The CNI score is an average of the following five socio -economic barrier scores for each community: 1. Income Barriers 2. Cultural Barriers 3. Educational Barriers 4. Insurance Barriers 5. Housing Barriers 58 According to Mayo Clinic, diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the bo dy uses blood sugar (glucose). Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by a combina tion of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors and often appears during childhood or adole scence. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age, though it's more common in people who are overweight or older than 40 (Mayo Clinic, 2022 ). Throughout this report, Sharp data relating to diabetes primarily refers to type 2. 59 Accordi ng to the WHO , health inequities are differences in health status or in the distribution of health resources between different population groups arising from the social conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. These inequities hav e significant social and economic costs both to individuals and societies (WHO, 2018). Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 57 CNI scores range from 1.0 to 5.0, with a score of 1.0 indicat ing a ZIP code with the least need/low health inequity (light blue in Figures 11-15 below), and a score of 5.0 for a ZIP code with the most need/high health inequity (dark green in Figures 11-15 below). For more information about the C NI, please see Appendix L or visit the interactive website at: http://cni.dignityhealth.org/ . Table 21 presents primary communities (by ZIP code) se rved by SMH and SMBHWN that have especially high need/ health inequity based on their CNI score. Table 21: High -Need Primary Communities Served by SMH and SMBHWN , CNI Score > 4.04 ZIP 91910, Chula Vista 91942 La Mesa Cajon 92021 Cajon 92101 City 92102 San Diego 92104 North Park 92105 City Heights 92111 Linda Vista 92113 Southeast San Diego 92114 Encanto 92115 College Area 92154 Nestor In addition, Figures 11-15 present CNI maps for SDC \u2014 including many communities served by SMH and SMBHWN \u2014 with Sharp hospital discharge data for behavioral health, cancer, cardiovascular health, COVID -19 and Type 2 diabetes overlaid on the map. The maps demonstrate that while these health conditions affect communities of varying need, those areas with the highest CNI score (i.e., the highest vulnerability) often present higher discharge rates for these health issues. Thus, the maps strongly suggest the connection between rates of illness and disease, health care use, socioeconomic factors and health equity.

The Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (HASD&IC 2022 CHNA ) process included strong representation of the communit ies served by SMH and SMBHWN and a significant portion of its findings reflect the same needs of community members served by the hospitals . Therefore, relevant findings from the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA are a lso included. 2022 CHNA The HASD&IC 2022 CHNA identified the following priority community needs for San Diego County (SDC ) (listed in alphabetical order): Figure - Top Community Needs for SDC Access to Health Care Aging Care & Support Behavioral Health Children & Youth Well -Being Chronic Health Conditions Community Safety Economic Stability Figure 16 above represents the top identified community needs, the foundational challenges, and the key underlying themes revealed through the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA process.

Access to Health Care Overall Findings Access to Health Care emerged as a high priority need in both the SMH and HASD&IC 2022 CHNAs. Access to Health Care findings most often relate to the issues listed below , spanning from general barriers to accessing care to disparities and challenges in access ing care for specific populations . The findings also highlight the exacerbation of Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 65 these access to care issues caused by the COVID -19 pandemic for both community members and health care providers. Overall barriers to care Telehealth Health literacy Transportation Health insurance and financial concerns Stigma LGBTQ+ People experiencing homelessness Other populations ( end-of-life, immigration status, parents/ caregivers) Culturally competent and linguistically appropriate care Trauma -Informed Care (TIC) Workforce challenges Access to Health Care findings are described below for both the HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA Overall Barriers to Care Across HASD&IC's interviews and focus groups, there was universal acknowledgment that the pandemic caused widespread disruption to local health care system s in SDC . Factors identified as impacting the ability to access health care included postponed or canceled procedures, long wait times for appointments and the fear of COVID -19 exposure. Fear, specifically, caused some people to defer routine and medically necessa ry care. Among online survey participants, 59% identified Access to Health Care as a top concern and 31% identified long waits for an appointment as the top challenge in accessing health care. According to HASD&IC's secondary data findings , among Califor nians who report skipping or postponing care in the prior 12 months, more than half (57%) cited the COVID -19 pandemic as the reason.61 In addition, community members expressed the importance of spending enough time and having meaningful conversations with their doctor to fully evaluate their health needs and listen to their concerns. Quick and less thorough doctor visits created challenges to receiving the comprehensive care patients were hoping for. Community members expressed the importance of building a relationship with a doctor who will listen and help them maintain health. 61 California Health Care Foundati on (CHCF) (2022), The 2022 CHCF California Health Policy Survey . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 66 Community members shared the underlying challenges they experienced with accessing needed health care services. Significant challenges related to logistics and level of care includ e: Making an appointment with primary care or accessing their usual source of care. Insurance restrictions and confusion. For example, having a certain type of insurance, such as a health maintenance organization, and being limited to in - network providers only. Need for referrals as a barrier to accessing services or treatments. Finding the right fit with a provider, such as a primary care or behavioral health care professional. Timeliness in relation to level of care, such as after -hours urgent care. Community members identified several types of care as being particularly difficult to access , including specialty or referral -based care, oral or dental care, behavioral health care and follow -up care. In HASD&IC's online community survey , respondents identified these services as hardest to access: behavioral health services, counseling or therapy, psychiatry, dental services and urgent care/after-hours care. Referrals to see a specialist was commonly cited as a significant challenge. Com munity members reported long waits for services, treatments and procedures. Finding providers who can submit orders or make referrals can be time consuming. Many patients fall through the cracks, and some do not receive follow -up on their requests. Some of the specialty care mentioned by community members as being the most challenging to access was either necessary for a certain health concern or care that aligned with cultural or spiritual health -related beliefs , such as : women's health services ; dermato logy; physical therapy ; orthopedics ; gender affirming care ; gastroenterology ; ear, nose and throat ; memory/neurology ; alternative/holistic care ; and chiropractic services. Timely and appropriate behavioral health care was identified as the most challengi ng to access. For more information on behavioral and mental health care, please see the Behavioral Health finding s. In-home services, dental care and providers trained in geriatric care were cited as need s for aging community members. Please see the Aging Care & Support finding s for more information. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 67 Telehealth62 Telehealth usage expanded rapidly during the pandemic to allow health care providers and patients to connect virtually in a safe manner. In 2021, more Californians reported using telehealth as their means of receiving care over the prior 12 months \u2014 over half (55%) by phone and 44% by video.61 HASD&IC's community engagement findings revealed that telehealth increased access to health care for some community members with existing barriers prior to the pandemic. The opportunity to connect virtually with a doctor was a convenient option for those with childcare responsibilities, or who lacked access to transportation. Some people preferred to receive care in the comfort of their own home. However, telehealth was not easily accessible for the entire community. The most frequently cited barriers were a lack of access to techn ology or the internet. Some community members reported being uncomfortable and uncertain about how to navigate the internet (lack of digital literacy) to access their me dical records, labs or paperwork needed for appointments. Community -based organizations (CBOs) and health care providers had to come up with creative ways to ensure that people had access to telehealth. Community members shared that telehealth during the p andemic was not an optimal choice for certain groups of people, including those living in crowded households where there was little to no privacy; those with physical health needs that required in -person care and thorough screenings; and those lacking a ph one or smart phone, including seniors and individuals experiencing homelessness. Preliminary research on the use of telehealth during the pandemic is beginning to emerge. Key findings from HASD&IC's quantitative data analysis include: There were 52.7 mil lion Medicare telehealth visits in 2020, a 63 -fold increase compared to 2019. This report also found inequities: some Medicare beneficiaries, including Black and rural populations, used telehealth less frequently than their white and urban counterparts.63 A majority (57%) of providers viewed telehealth more favorably than before COVID -19, and 64% are now more comfortable using it.64 Remote care reduces the use of resources in health centers, improves access to care while minimizing the risk of direct transm ission of an infectious agent from person -to-person, and provides wider access to caregivers.65 62 The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) defines telemedicine as the practice of medicine using technology to deliver remote clinical services. Telehealth refers broadly to electro nic and telecommunications technologies and services used to provide care and services at a distance. It is different from telemedicine in that it refers to a broader scope of remote health care services than telemedicine (AAFP, 2022). The National Institu te on Aging (NIA) notes telehealth can include non -clinical services, for example health -related education , such as diabetes management or nutrition courses and health -related training and that these types of care may be particularly helpful for older adul ts with limited mobility and for those living in rural areas (NIA, 2020 ). 63 Seshamani, M.

There was a need for more education to help people understand basic health information. For example, more education on preventive health care, healthy lifestyles, and understanding the differences between so urces of care ( e.g., when to use urgent care vs. the emergency room). Both community members and health care providers agreed that health care settings should use simple, plain language forms \u2014 preferably at a sixth grade reading level \u2014 to help people u nderstand the information that is provided to them. Hospital clinicians shared that when patients are sick or in pain, it could be even more challenging for them to fully process health information or follow post -discharge instructions , including medicatio n adherence. The pandemic further exacerbated existing health literacy challenges. For example, many community members had to navigate the internet to access health information for the first time or had difficulty finding credible online resources to get trusted information about the COVID -19 vaccines. Navigating the health care system was identified as an increasingly challenging and stressful task. Specific challenges included people not understanding their health insurance benefits, no t knowing who m to call to access services, and identifying where to get care. Getting a hold of one's own health care provider or insurance company was extremely difficult. Populations who were identified as having significant challenges were people who sp eak little to no English, people experiencing homelessness and justice -involved67 individuals. Interviewees from CBOs shared that there is a significant need for justice -involved individuals to be guided and connected to critically necessary health care se rvices and resources after being released from an institution. English speaking people and community members who identified as being highly educated also described the health care system as being very difficult to navigate. 66 Healthy People 2030 (HP 2030) provides definitions for both personal health literacy and organizational health literacy. Personal health literacy - the degree to which individuals can find, understand, and use information and services to inform health -related decisions and actions for themselves and others. Organizational health literacy is the degree to which organizations equitabl y enable individuals to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health -related decisions and actions for themselves and others (HP 2030, 2022) Further, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CD C), individuals who read well and are comfor table using numbers can face health literacy issues when they aren't familiar with medical terms or how their bodies function; they must interpret statistics and evaluate risks and benefits that affect their health and safety; th ey are diagnosed with a ser ious illness and are scared or confused; or they have health conditions that require complicated self -care (CDC, 2020). 67 This descriptor indicates past or current involvement in the criminal justice system, typically indicating the person has exp erienced one or more of the following: an arrest, prosecution, incarceration in a jail or prison, and/or community supervision (S ubstance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [S AMHSA ], 2019 ). Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 69 SDC is a diverse region, and co mmunity members speak a variety of languages. While the majority of the county's population age 5 and older speaks only English at home (62.4%), many people speak a non -English language at home as well.19 For additional information on languages spoken in SDC, see Section 4: Community Defined . A study of refugee communities in SDC representing over 1,400 residents of East African, Middle Eastern, Central and South Asian, and Haitian backgrounds noted that during the COVID -19 pandemic, having no or limited English proficiency (LEP) negatively aff ected information access. This was reported as an overall sense of confusion due to language barriers and lack of coordinated information delivered in multiple languages and dialects .23 Countywide data is included in Figure 17 below.19 This highlights the importance of multilingual health educational materials and providers to increase health literacy and equity. The State of California Department of Healthcare Services requires all Medi -Cal managed care plans to provide written member information translated into languages that meet a numeric threshold of 3,000 or 5% of the eligible beneficiary population, whichever is lower.68 Figure 17: Languages Spoken at Home in S DC19 Transportation HASD&IC community engagement participants shared that transportation to medical appointments is an issue for people without cars, or for anyone without reliable transportation. Public transportation was described as time -consuming and difficult to 68 State of California Health and Human Services Agency Department of Health Care Services (2022), Standards for Determining Threshold Languages, Nondiscrimination Requirements, and Language Assistance Services . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 70 navigate . Without access to transportation, people are likely to miss or reschedule appointments, postpone care and be unable to pick up medications. Populations with the greatest barriers were identified as people living in rural communities, older adults, people with limited mobility and who are homebound , and people experiencing homelessness. Health Insurance and Financial Concerns Throughout HASD&IC's community engagement activities, lack of insurance was identified as a significant barrier to care for San Di egans. Some uninsured community members described being unable to pay for health insurance because they have other competing financial priorities, such as housing costs. People who are consistently undocumented experience challenges accessing health care because they are more likely to be uninsured or have restricted health coverage benefits that only cover emergency services. There are little to no health care resources available in the community to serve the undocumented population. A recurring theme shared by community members and health care providers was the difficulty uninsured and underinsured community members face when trying to access follow -up care, treatments or prescriptions. Uninsured and underinsured individuals are often unable to pay out of pocket for these services. LGBTQ+ community members also shared that lack of insurance is a common barrier for health. However, even with insurance, they often face challenges getting the care they need. According to HASD&IC's sec ondary data collection, 1 in 4 Californians (25%) say they or someone in their family had problems paying at least one medical bill in the past 12 months, an increase from 20% in the 2021 survey. Forty -three percent of lower income Californians report havi ng issues paying for medical bills, compared to 32% in 2021.61 Both the high cost of health care and medical debt were frequently identified by HASD&IC community engagement participants as severe obstacles to health care access. Due to high health care costs, many community members delay seeking care or cross the bord er to get more affordable health care services (including dental and vision) in Mexico. However, when the border closed due to the pandemic, people were unable to travel to Mexico for health care. Participants also shared that fear of medical debt was ca using people to delay getting treatment because they are already struggling to pay their bills. Community members shared that either they personally, or family or friends, have medical debt following a hospital stay. As a result, they worried about seeking emergency care at local hospitals. The need for financial assistance to help pay for medical bills was a frequent and a significant need shared by many of those interviewed. There are some programs Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 71 available at no cost or low cost to help pay for service s, but community members are not always informed of those resources. Some people find out about these resources by word of mouth from a family member or friend. Stigma69 Stigma was also identified as a significant barrier to accessing care, particularly for LGTBQ+ community members, people experiencing homelessness, older adults and undocumented or refugee communities. Community members shared feelings of anxiety or fear, and a likelihood of avoiding or delaying care due to concerns of being treated diff erently. Community members insured through the Medi -Cal program also experience stigma while accessing care. Additional f indings on stigma as a barrier to accessing health care are included below for select populations. LGBTQ+ Accessing and navigating ca re was described as procedurally difficult and complex for the LGBTQ+ community. The traditional approach to health care was described as non - inclusive and inadequately meeting the unique health needs of LGBTQ+ people. There is a paramount need for more safe, affirming and competent providers. Finding a gender -affirming provider is critically important for the LGBTQ+ community, to foster trust in their provider and feel comfort able fully discuss ing all health needs. The current network of gender -affirming providers is very limited and providers are hard to find. LGBTQ+ people rely on community -kept records or word of mouth to learn of providers who meet this criteria. Clinicians shared that transge nder and gender diverse people without insurance \u2014 particularly those who are undocumented \u2014 or people who are unable to access gender -affirming care are more likely to have risky and dangerous procedures done in non-health care settings. LGBTQ+ people ex perience health disparities and require care and services tailored to their unique needs.70 The process of asking all patients about their sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) empowers health centers to get to know their patients better and to pro vide them with the culturally responsive, patient -centered services they need. SOGI data collection also allows health centers to learn about the populations they are 69 Stigma can be generally defined as negative attitudes or beliefs towards another individual or group, which can result in shame, embarrassment or fear. Stigma referenced in this report could either be directly related to a COVID -19 diagnosis or vaccination status or unrelated (e.g., based on age, ra ce/ethnicity, gender, etc.). 70 Gonzales, G., Przedworski, J., & Henning -Smith, C.

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 72 serving, and to measure the access to care and quality of care provided to people of all sexual orientations and gender identities.71 Interviewees shared that LGBTQ+ people experience stigma and discrimination at all touch points of the health care system, especially from health care providers who lack sensitivity. Additionally, current forms and practices were identified as non -inclusive. For example, new patient or intake forms only provide binary options (male or female) , which exclude s non-binary community members. People have also struggled with being acknowledged by their ne w affirmed name and are often deadnamed.72 These negative experiences create an unwelcoming and unsafe environment and were identified by interviewees as reasons for avoiding or delaying medically necessary care. Further, s ome people who are transgender experience \"gender dysphoria,\" a mismatch between the sex they were assigned at birth and their gender identity, which can cause extreme distress or discomfort. People experiencing gender dysphoria often feel desperation when they do not feel understood o r cared for and may feel that they do not have any other options to obtain care. Advocates shared that in some cases, transgender community members will take extreme measures to avoid the trauma of trying to access the traditional health care system. Interviewees also shared that for those who are uninsured, access to medications like PrEP73 or PeP74 and necessary follow -up care is hindered by extreme cost s. For those with insurance, out -of-pocket costs may be even higher , as many insurance companies do no t cover these treatments. These high costs disproportionately impact BIPOC75 LGBTQ+ individuals, who are more likely to be low -income.76 Intersectional stigma77 also emerged as a barrier to accessing appropriate health care for LGBTQ+ individuals. Black transgender women face many challenges related to the convergence of race, gender identity and economic status in their lived experience. They are particularly vulnerable to health disparities, such as higher rates of HIV diagnoses. In 2 019, the majority of new HIV diagnoses among transgender people were among Black or African American people: 45% for transgender women and 41% for 71 Cahill, S., & Makadon, H. (2014).

While on PrEP, a regimen must be followed consisting of follow -up visits, continuous HIV testing, and obtaining refills (CDC, 2022). 74 PeP, also known as post -exposure prophylaxis, is similar to PrEP, except that it is taken when the patie nt believes they have been exposed to HIV. It must be taken within 3 days after the exposure, otherwise it is not effective. 75 Black, indigenous and people of color. 76 The Williams Institute (2019), LGBT poverty in the United States: A study of difference s between sexual orientation and gender identity groups . 77 Intersectional stigma occurs when an individual or group experience(s) multiple stigmas that both overlapping and co -constitutive.

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 73 transgender men.78 Black trans gender people also experience inequities related to unemployment, homelessness, household income level and attempted suicide.79 Further, LGBTQ+ people and people living with HIV are too often denied the care they need because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or HIV status. In a survey of LGBT people and people living wi th HIV on discrimination in health care , almost 8% of respondents reported that they had been denied needed health care outright. Over a quarter of transgender or gender -nonconforming respondents and 19% of respondents living with HIV reported being denied care.80 People Experiencing Homelessness Those experiencing homelessness can face months -long wait lists for shelter beds. During these long wait times, many are pushed to use any resources available to them to survive until the following day. In some circumstances, this could mean a trip to the emergency room to obtain food, cloth ing or a safe place to sleep for the night. For those with a very limited income, emergency department ( ED) visits tend to become more frequent toward the end of the month, as their financial resources dwindle. Lack of housing and personal resources caus e many people experiencing homelessness to access care for episodic, emergency situations. Interviewees frequently cited chronic health conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure (CHF), chronic pain and diabe tes as the most common reasons patients experiencing homelessness access health care in the ED. Another reason for accessing care in the ED was related to inconsistently taking or completely discontinuing medications. Please see the Chronic Health Conditions finding s for more information. There was agreement a mong HASD&IC's interviewees that having a safe place to stay after being discharged from the hospital is crucial to recovery and healing; without a stable place to stay, community members experiencing homelessness could undo any progress made during their hospitalization. Recuperative care (also known as medical respite care) was cited as a specific need for many patients experiencing homelessness who no lon ger need to be hospitalized but must still have a place to heal and recover from an illness or injury. In addition to recuperative care, lack of post -acute care with housing and medication management for patients experiencing significant behavioral health concerns was mentioned as a need. This includes assisted living, board and care facilities and Full 78 CDC (2021), HIV Surveillance Report: Diagnoses of HIV Infection in the United States and Dependent Areas, 2019 . 79 National L esbian , Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer Task Force (2009), Injustice at Every Turn: A Look at Black Respondents in the National Transgender Discrimination Survey . 80 Lambda Legal (2010 ), When Health Care Isn't Caring: Lambda Legal's Survey of Discrimination Against LGBT People and People with HIV . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 74 Services Partnership81 programs. Please see the Behavioral Health finding s for more information. Interviewees shared that people experiencing homelessness often feel marginalized, socially excluded , and discriminated against by other community members, services and health care providers. This social exclusion, coupled with daily challenges in building or maintaining social connections with others, makes them fearful of experiencing further discrimina tion. Subsequently, many people experiencing homelessness feel uncomfortable, distressed or undeserving of help when they seek health care treatment or need help for safety reasons. Access to home health devices was identified by interviewees as an existi ng need for patients experiencing homelessness that was worsened by the pandemic. Lack of a physical address and lack of a place to receive mail is one of the main barriers people experiencing homelessness face in securing home health. Though home health m ay be an appropriate post -discharge treatment option for certain patients experiencing homelessness, it can be challenging to provide necessary equipment, such as wheelchairs, walkers, canes or portable CPAP82 machines. In addition, inability to maintain sanitary conditions could lead to a higher risk of infection and there are challenges with equipment being stolen. Interviewees shared further that even if outpatient services for home health devices can be arranged, transportation is often a barrier to ac cessing these services. Other Populations (End -of-Life, Immigration Status, Parents/Caregivers) Despite the increased use of hospice and palliative care in recent decades, disparities in access to hospice care and end -of-life treatment persist.83 Comm unity members shared that it's difficult to find palliative care programs offering culturally diverse services. This is a particular challenge for community members who are LGBTQ+, veterans and people of color. The result is an increase in ED visits and ho spitalizations in the last six months of life for these populations, compared to non -Hispanic white individuals, regardless of cause of death.84 In addition, across all interviews, community members, CBOs and hospital leaders described undocumented immigr ants as living in a \"constant state of fear\" of detention and deportation. This fear prevents them from accessing health care, even in life - threatening or dire situations. Moreover, multiple changes to public charge85 rules over 81 Full Service Partnership (FSP) is a comprehensive and intensive mental health program for adults with severe and persistent mental illness. FSP uses a \"whatever it takes\" field -based approach using innovative interventions to help people reach their recovery goals.

Further, HASD&IC's community engagement participants shared that parents or caregivers with children ofte n face challenges accessing health care , such as making it to appointments, if they do not have access to childcare. Culturally Competent and Linguistically Appropriate Care A primary theme across focus groups and interviews was the need for more cultura lly competent and linguistically appropriate care. Community members shared their preference for receiving health care from providers who reflect their race and ethnicity. Specific populations, including individuals of Latino and Arabic descent, were conce rned that they are not treated fairly because of their cultural differences and thus it was harder for them to trust providers. Language was identified as a significant access -to-care barrier for non -English speaking and LE P community members. Having a pr ovider who speaks the patient's language builds trust, understanding and a comfortable environment in which to share health concerns. Many people who speak little to no English rely on family or friends for translation. Using a loved one was identified as limiting patient -provider privacy, which could result in the patient not fully disclosing their entire medical condition or needs. Language barriers were identified as a reason some community members avoid seeking care. Translation services have not been an adequate alternative to help with patient -provider communication and building trust. When a patient does not have access to a translator, health care providers use translation services via technology or the telephone. Specific challenges using translation services were identified as causing miscommunication: Because many of these translators do not have medical training, they may not be able to accurately translate what is being said by a health care provider. Transla tors often speak at a higher reading level or use more formal language than the patient . Telephone translators are unable to read facial expressions or body language to identify if patients fully understand what they are explaining. Trauma -Informed Care (TIC)86 The need for a trauma -informed approach to care echoed throughout HASD&IC's research and interview process. A multitude of perspectives highlighted the depth and 86 Trauma -Informed Care (TIC) is an organizational practice framework that involves understanding, recognizing and responding to the effects of all types of trauma a person has experienced. TIC emphasizes physical, psychological and emotional safety for both patients and providers, and helps rebuild a sense of control and empowerment (https://theacademy.sdsu.edu/programs/cwds/traum a-informed -care/). Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 76 range of traumas87 many people have experienced in their lifetime. Trauma -informed providers i mprove access and connection to care, creating a positive impact on the overall health of the community. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (S AMHSA ) has noted the items in Table 22 as examples of the types of trauma people may expe rience. It should be noted that there can be overlap, as some traumatic experiences fit into multiple categories.88 Table 22: Types and Categories of Trauma88 Trauma Types and Categories Community Complex Domestic violence Early childhood Group Historical Human caused Human trafficking Individual Mass Medical Natural Physical Political terror and war Refugee Repeated Secondary Sexual Single Sustained System -oriented re -traumatization Traumatic grief Vicarious Traumatic events such as adverse childhood experiences (ACE s), domestic violence, elder abuse and combat trauma are associated with long -term physical and psychological health effects. Please see the Children & Youth Well -Being findings for more information about ACEs. These events may have a negative impact on health care experiences and the likelihood of seeking preventive care. Th ese barriers highlight the importance of TIC for people with this kind of lived experience. TIC incorporates a set of assumptions c alled \"the four Rs \": TIC realizes the widespread impact of trauma and understands potential paths for recovery; recognizes the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients, families, staff and others involved with the system; responds by fully integrating knowl edge about trauma into policies, procedures and practices; and seeks to actively resist re-traumatization.89 TIC can refer to either evidence -based trauma interventions or to a broader systems -level approach that integrates trauma -informed practices throug hout a service delivery system (e.g., health care system, educational system, law enforcement).90 87 Individual trauma results from an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as ph ysically or emotionally harmful or life threatening, and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual's functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well -being (SAMHSA, 2016). Trauma refers to what happens inside our bodies during and after the event, not the event itself. Trauma can be experienced as a group, community or mass and diffe rentiates between them. In addition, trauma perceived as intentionally harmful often makes the event more traumatic for people and communities (SAMHSA, 2014). 88 SAMHSA (2014), TIP 57 Trauma -Informed Care in Behavioral Health Services; The National Child Tr aumatic Stress Network, Trauma Types . 89 SAMHSA (2014), Concept of Trauma and Guidance for a Trauma -Informed Approach . 90 SAMHSA (2022), National Strategy for Trauma -Informed Care Operating Plan. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 77 TIC is important because people who have experienced trauma may not seek health care until it is an emergency. Negative health outcomes can occur when indivi duals avoid preventive care and other routine services. This is of particular concern for certain populations who are more likely to experience trauma, such as people who are BIPOC, LGBTQ+ or have been trafficked. Implementing a TIC approach creates a more comfortable and inclusive environment conducive to a more equitable health care experience and better overall quality of life. As mandated reporters, health care providers play an important role in TIC , as nearly 90% of people who are being trafficked see k care during that period.91 People who have experienced traumatic events carry that trauma throughout their life. They may seem apprehensive, reluctant to share their needs or slow to trust providers. This fear and distrust can sometimes lead impacted individuals to use traditional remedies or delay care until it becomes an emergency. Recognizing implicit bias and microaggressions is fundamental to understanding what may potentially trigger adverse reactions, especially for patients from culturally or linguistically diverse backgrounds. Individuals who have been affected by traumatic events can pass their trauma down through generations, causing descendants to experience it as well. Furthermore, due to biological changes in the stress response system, these experiences are li nked to a greater risk of health inequities.92 HASD&IC's i nterviewees shared the importance of education, training and treating those they serve with dignity. Acknowledging the presence of trauma symptoms and the role trauma may play in a person's health decisions is critical. Because challenges related to trauma can trigger adverse feelings or make people feel unsafe, providers should be respectful, gentle and provide a welcoming, affirming environment. Implementing trauma -informed approaches to care by recognizing trauma, strengthening resiliency , and avoiding re -traumatization can lead to more open communication, greater patient engagement , and overall better attention to the broad spectrum of patient needs. Finally, health and service providers can als o experience trauma, including compassion fatigue. Researchers have identified two types of compassion fatigue: secondary and vicarious. According to SAMHSA, for some first responders, secondary traumatic stress refers to aspects of their work that can mak e them feel like the trauma experienced by the people they help is happening to them or someone in their lives. When these feelings are prolonged, they can develop into vicarious trauma.93 91 Polaris Project (2018), On-Ramps, Intersections, and Exit Routes: A Roadmap for Systems and Industries to Prevent and Disrupt Human Trafficking . 92 Arambula Solomon, M., Antone , C.L., Flores Jr., M., & Garcia, F.

This work -related trauma expos ure can occur from such experiences as listening to individual clients recount their victimization; looking at videos of exploited children; reviewing case files; hearing about or responding to the afterm ath of violence and other traumatic events day after day; and responding to mass violence incidents that have resulted in numerous injuries and deaths (U.S. Department of Justice [DOJ] Office for Victims of Crime, 2013). Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 78 Workforce Challenges Workforce shortage was identified by HASD&IC community engagement participants as the number one priority for local health care providers. The pandemic severely strained the existing health care workforce and s taffing shortages exacerbated challenges in meeting the growing demand for communit y services. Community engagement participants recognized that all health care settings , including behavioral health , were understaffed and described how workforce shortages adversely impact the patient experience. The health care sector has lost nearly ha lf a million workers since February 202094 and new data suggests that 18% of health care workers have quit during the pandemic and 12% have been laid off.95 From the end of 2019 to the second quarter of 2021, the staff vacancy rate at California hospitals jumped 98% and 78% of hospitals reported an increase in staff turnover. California needs to add 500,000 new allied health care professionals by 2024 in order to meet the demand for care.96 An overwhelming sense of exhaustion and intense burnout was expres sed throughout interviews with health care providers who cared for the sickest and most vulnerable patients during the pandemic. Additional factors identified as contributing to stress among health care workers include excessive administrative requirements and a lack of available resources in the community. Without these resources, hospital clinicians and social workers shared that they are unable to fully support patients with follow -up care. Burnout has led many health care professionals to retire earl y, relocate to different internal departments or leave the industry entirely. Both clinic and hospital administrators shared that recruiting and retaining health care workers has become increasingly difficult as they compete with other companies that offer more competitive salaries or benefits. Further, health care providers noted that the workforce shortage is creating a wider equity gap \u2014 fewer culturally competent and linguistically appropriate providers are available to care for SDC's diverse communit ies.

In addition, the complete results of HASD&IC's on line community engagement survey are available within the Employment Situation . 95 CHCF (2022), COVID -19 Is Reshaping California's Health Workforce . 96 Hospital Association of San Diego & Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) (2022), As Budget Season Gets into Full Swing, Workforce Challenges Can't Be Ignored . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 79 SMH 2022 CHNA Overall Barriers to Care The majority of participants in the Institute for Public Health (IPH) Sharp Provider Survey indicated that the COVID -19 pandemic had a moderate or major impact on limiting patients' access to behavioral health care (91%), specialty care (86%) and primary care (79%). In addition, 85% reported the pandemic either moderately or majorly increased patients' fear about accessing health care. Employees who participated in the IPH Sharp Human Resources Survey reported Sharp's own workforce faced challenges in accessing health care due to COVID -19. Approximately 80% reported that the pandemic caused at least a minor decrease in employees' access to either primary or specialty care and 86% reported increased fear of using health care services . In addition, 58% of Sharp Insight Community Survey participants reported the pandemic caused at least a minor decrease in their access to in -person medical care. Telehealth Considering the increas ed use of telehealth during the pandemic, IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants had the opportunity to comment on patients' use of virtual visits for health care, including ease of access to vi rtual visits, challenges with access, preferences for in -person or virtual visits , and the use of different telehealth modalities. Of those who provided feedback : 76% indicated the COVID -19 pandemic had a moderate or major impact on patients' ease of accessing visits. Respondents had mixed feedback about how easily patients can access video visits; 42% agreed or strongly agreed that patients could easily access video visits, while 58% disagreed or strongly disagreed. Most (91%) noted that lack of access to and knowledge about technology are primary barriers to accessing video visits. Inability to afford technology, insufficient internet access, and unreliable technology were also reported as challenges to access. Most (87%) agreed some patients prefer in -person visits for reasons beyond challenges with access to video visits, including to better connect with their provider and for more confidence in their care. The primary reason (96%) offered for preferring in -person visits was simply that patients prefer to communicate in person. This was followed by technol ogy challenges (76%), concerns about loss of personal connection between provider and patient (58%), and concerns about medical personnel's ability to perform a virtual physical exam (43%). More than half of providers indicated their ability to care for p atients, and patients themselves, could benefit from video visits (71%), electronic medication Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 80 reminders (61%), secure messaging (55%), and electronic health education (54%). Many also believed remote patient monitoring, audio -only visits and digital self-reporting of patient outcomes could be beneficial. Only 5% did not think telehealth has any benefits to their patients. Sharp Insight Community Survey participants also provided input on their use of telehealth during the past year. Feedback included the following : 45% had interacted with a Sharp health care professional (physician, nurse, etc.) through a video visit and 33% had interacted through an audio -only visit. Most respondents (77%) who had a video visit reported it being \"effective ,\" and most (69%) who had an audio -only telehealth visit reported it being \"effective .\" Of those who ha d a video visit, 82% reported that overall they liked their visit. Of those who had an audio -only visit, 76% reported that overall they liked their visit. 33% of respondents who liked their virtual visit (either video or audio) attributed their liking to convenience. Most of those who disliked their virtual visit attributed this to either a physical or general disconnect with their provider. Health Literacy Nearly all (99%) respondents to the IPH Sharp Provider Survey reported the pandemic had at least a minor impact on decreased health literacy ( i.e., capacity to process or understand basic health information and services in order to make appropriate health decisions). Transportation Nearly all (99%) IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants reported the pand emic had at least a minor impact on patients' access to transportation. Ideas provided to address this included increasing community awareness about shutt le access/Sharp Van Services and providing telehealth. In addition, the pandemic was cited as having at least a minor impact on access to transportation for 15% of Sharp Insight Community Survey participants. Stigma69 The majority (93%) of IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants reported that COVID -19 had at least a minor impact on stigma experienced by patients in the health care setting. In addition, the majority (88%) of IPH Sharp Human Resources Survey respondents indicated at least a minor increase in stigma in the workplace due to COVID -19. Further, at least a minor increase in stigma experienced in the health care setting due to COVID -19 was cited by 29% of Sharp Insight Community Survey participants . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 81 Culturally Competent and Linguistically Appropriate Care Sharp provides a variety of educational opportunities designed to support employees' personal and professional development. Employees who participated in the IPH community engagement surveys had the opportunity to choose among educational topics they would be most interested in learning about. Feedback from those who responded are highlighted below. IPH Sharp Provider Survey : Defining cultural humility and applying it to health care was one of the most frequently chosen topi cs among Sharp providers (50%) in addition to the impact of implicit/unconscious bias on decision -making (40%) . Interest in other topics related culturally competent and linguistically appropriate care was as follows Maternal and infant health with a focu s on the Black community (2 0%) Disparities in the Black community (27%) Disparities in Asian communities (2 4%) Disparities in the Latinx community ( 24%) Disparities in immigrant communities ( 31%) IPH Sharp Human Resources Survey: The most frequently chosen topics of interest by Sharp human resources employees included the impact of implicit/unconsc ious bias on decision -making (80%) and defining cultural humility and applying it to health care (53%) . Interest in other topics related culturally competent and linguistically appropriate care was as follows: Maternal and infant health with a focus on the Black community (27%) Disparities in the Black community (27%) Disparities in Asian communities (20%) Disparities in the Latinx community (7%) Disparities in immigrant communities (7%) Workforce Challenges As previously noted in the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA findings on Access to Health Care , the COVID -19 pandemic caused health care workforce shortages which resulted in challenges with meeting the health care needs of community members. Due to COVID -19, n early 90% of Sharp professionals who participated in the IPH Sharp Human Resources Survey expressed either a moderate or major increase in employees' d esire to change careers or leave the workforc e. Of these , the majority (78%) reported that Sharp does not have program s or services available to address this issue. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 82 Nearly 90% also reported that COVID -19 caused at least a moderate increase in employees' frustration or disengagement with their work . Fortunately, m ost of these respondents (73%) indicated that Sharp has established programs to address these issues. Please see the following appendices for more information on SMH 's 2022 CHNA Access to Health Care findings: Appendix I : IPH Sharp Provider/Human Resources 2022 CHNA Survey & Findings Appendix J : Sharp Insight Community 2022 CHNA Survey & Findings Aging Care & Support Overall Findings Concern s that disproportionately affect care and support during the aging process were identified as a high priority need in both the SMH and HASD&IC 2022 CHNAs. The findings for Aging Care & Support most often relat e to the health and social issues listed below , including the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on older adults in relation to these issues. Economic stability and risk of homelessness Social isolation Access to health care Access to community resources and support Behavioral health Stigma Other health and safety concerns Aging Care & Support findings are described below for both the HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA Economic Stability and Risk of Homelessness Throughout HASD&IC's community engagement activities, economic instability emerged as a theme in every conversation that focused on seniors. Interview and focus group participants expressed that t here are significant financial barriers to aging at home with dignity. Seniors who are considered higher -resourced may need to sell their homes or possessions to qualify for the assistance they need. Low -income seniors often struggle to afford home modifications or equipment that can allow them to continue Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 83 living safely and independently in their homes, such as grab bars, wheelchair ramps or shower chairs. If seniors cannot afford to make necessary modifications to their homes, they may experience health -related impacts, such as becoming bed -bound or conditions worsening. Additional data analysis revealed that s eniors are at a higher risk of poverty for many reasons, including limited income. Low -income seniors depend on public programs like Medi -Cal and cash assistance (Supplemental Security Income) to make ends meet. Factors such as chronic health conditions, disability, and loss of a significant other al so contribute to an increased risk of poverty. See Figure 18 for the rates of seniors living in poverty in SDC and Table 23 for the top needs of older adults served by 2 -1-1 San Diego. Figure 18: Percent of Se niors Age s 65+ Living Below 100% FPL by SDC Region, 201919 Table 23: Top Five Needs for 2 -1-1 San Diego Clients Age s 60+, 202197 Needs Percent of Total Clients Total Clients 39,699 Housing 22% Utilities 17% Income Support and Employment 12% Consumer Services 12% Health Care 9% Older adults make up a significant portion of the county's unhoused population. In 2020, 1 in 4 unsheltered SDC residents were adults ages 55 and over. Among the region's unsheltered seniors, 88% became homeless in SDC and 43% reported experiencing homelessness for the first time in their lives.98 Nationwide, the population of individuals 97 2-1-1. (2022). Data Dashboard . https://211sandiego.org/data -dashboard 98 Serving Seniors (2021), Senior Homelessness: A Needs Assessment . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 84 ages 65 an d older experiencing homelessness is expected to nearly triple over the next decade \u2014 from 40,000 in 2020 to approximately 106,000 by 2030.99 In September 2021, Serving Seniors released a study on SDC's senior homelessness crisis. According to the report, many older adults become homeless because they lack an economic safety net. They experience catastrophic events with dire financial consequences and may take actions that compromise their health and safety to make ends meet. More than half (56%) of people interviewed during the study reported that an additional $300 or less of monthly income would increase their rent security. Some interview participants reported avoiding shelters due to safety concerns , including risk of theft, physical harm and potential exposure to substance use. The person or environmental fit of shelters may be another area for exploration , given functional impairments and health concerns associated with the aging process. Further , study participants reported challenges with identifying and accessing services and resources, as well as struggling with technological barriers, transportation and mobility limitations. Figure 19 below displays the personal sacrifices that more than half of olde r adult study participants have made to afford rent.98 Figure 19: Sacrifices Made by Older Adults to Afford Rent98 99 University of Pennsylvania (2019), The Emerging Crisis of Aged Homelessness: Could Housing Solutions Be Funded by Avoidance of Excess Shelter, Hosp ital, and Nursing Home Costs? Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 85 Social Isolation Concerns about the social isolation of seniors were also a universal theme in HASD&IC's focus groups and interviews. Due to COVID -19 safety guidelines and fear, many sen iors were isolated during the pandemic , and many remain isolated. Social isolation impa cts the health and well -being of seniors. Throughout the pandemic, some seniors were unable to access smart devices and were unable to virtually socialize with loved ones or participate in community -based activities. Increased isolation resulted in greater depression and anxiety among seniors . In some cases, seniors went without medical attention for more than a year during the pandemic and neither their doctor nor the ir family realized how significantly their cognitive abilities had declined. Geographic isolation creates additional challenges for seniors. It was evident to service providers interviewed during the community engagement process that geographically isolated seniors throughout the county need special assistance and consideration, such as food deliveries. Some seniors are not just geographically isolated but also live alone, so it is essential to have people who can check in on them. In addition, according to Serving Seniors' report on SDC's senior homelessness crisis, social isolation presents a significant behavioral health concern among older adults , which affects those experiencing homelessness. Almost half of surveyed older adults (45%) report ed feeling lonely, isolated or cut off from friends and family.98 Further, lonely seniors are twice as likely to use painkillers and sedatives, w hich frequently leads to substance use problems, accidents, medical complications, falls or death.100 Access to Health Care HASD&IC's community engagement participants emphasized that COVID -19 had a significant impact on older adults' ability to access health care services. This is of concern because older adults are at greater risk of having multiple chronic conditions, includ ing dementia. Due to concerns related to COVID -19, some seniors were unwilling to make in -person appointments at their doctors' offices and hospitals. Mobility issues related to aging, being homebound, disabled, or dependent on a mobility aid are signif icant barrier s to accessing health care for many seniors. Physical limitations , such as vision or hearing loss, require extra assistance, consideration and accommodation that may not be readily available. 100 Kotwal, A.A., Steinman, M.A., Cenzer, I., & Smith, A.K. (2021). Use of High -risk Medications Among Lonely Older Adults: Results From a Nationally Representative Sample. JAMA Internal Medicine , 181(11), 1528 -1530. doi: 10.1 001/jamainternmed.2021.3775 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 86 Transportation and its costs were consistently ci ted as a barrier to seniors' ability to manage their health care, including getting to appointments on time or picking up prescriptions. Some seniors rely on family members for their transportation needs due to their age and physical limitations, but it ca n become overwhelming if there are frequent appointments and seniors may be reluctant to ask for help. Technology -based health care services and information are often not appropriate for older adults and seniors. Many older adults, especially those with lower incomes, cannot access information or necessary forms because they do not own or do not know how to use the required technology. Lack of access to technology and discomfort using technology also make telehealth appointments challenging for seniors. Vision and hearing challenges compound these difficulties. During the pandemic, access to appropriate post -acute care became a serious challenge for many seniors who were hospitalized with COVID -19 or other conditions. In some cases, skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) closed admissions due to COVID -19 outbreaks, ri sk of infection and low staffing. In general, patients enrolled in Medi -Cal are the least likely to be admitted to SNFs, especially if the patient is experiencing homelessness. Older adult patients experiencing homelessness have complex health needs that m ay require significant post -acute treatment and healing time, but options for longer -term, post-acute care with housing such as SNFs or recuperative care facilities are very limited. Further, community engagement participants identified inadequate dental coverage for seniors as a serious, ongoing issue that negatively impacts overall health. Seniors with Medicare do not have dental coverage. Seniors and older adults enrolled in Denti -Cal101 have extreme challenges finding providers. According to additional data analysis, oral health disparities are apparent in adults age s 65 and older. More than 9 in 10 older adults have had cavities, and 1 in 6 have untreated cavities. Older non -Hispanic Black or Mexican American adults have two to three times the rate of untreated cavities as non -Hispanic white adults in this age group.102 Further, County data indicates that ED and inpatient discharges have increased from 2017 to 2019 for disorders of th e teeth and jaw among those age s 65 and older.5 Disorders of the teeth and jaw include dental caries, loss of teeth , and other specified disorders of teeth and supporting structures.103 ED discharge rates increased by 14.2% from over the th ree year period, while inpatient discharge rates increased by 26.9% .5 See Figures 20 and 21 for discharge rates among older adults with disorders of the teeth and jaw.5 101 Denti -Cal is dental coverage for Medi -Cal beneficiaries. 102 CDC (2021), Disparities in Oral Health . 103 County of S an Diego HHSA , PHS, CHSU (2021), Public Use Codebook and Data Year: 2019 . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 87 Figure 20: ED Discharge Rate , Ages 65 and Older with Disorders of the Teeth and Jaw - SDC , 2017 -20195 Figure 21: Inpatient Discharge Rate , Ages 65 and Older with Disorders of the Teeth and Jaw - SDC , 2017 -20195 Behavioral Health Participants in the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement process expressed that seniors with behavioral health challenges face increasing difficulty accessing services. The most pressing concern identified by hospital clinicians was the lack of resources for seniors with behavioral health challenges. SNFs have limited willingness and capacity to accept patients with behavioral health diagnoses. This challenge is particularly acute for seniors who require psychotropic medications. There are few placement options for dementia patients who have behavioral health issues and show signs of agitation. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 88 Geriatric psychiatry resources are extremely limited, pa rticularly for senior patients who need to be discharged from the hospital to a more appropriate level of care. There is a high need for geropsychiatric care professionals to keep up with the expanding health care needs of the growing senior population, in cluding acute care specialists. When older adults struggle to access needed services, they may try to cope through substance use. Clinicians described recent increases in substance use among seniors, including alcohol, prescription drugs and illegal subst ances , such as methamphetamine (meth). In addition to these findings, a study conducted by researchers at a hospital in central San Diego found that elderly meth patients were more severely injured and required a higher level of care than other elderly patients. The study also found that w ithin SDC, individuals ages 55 to 64 have the highest rate of meth -related deaths of any age group (31.8 per 100,000).104 Stigma69 HASD&IC's communit y engagement participants described t he role that stigma plays in preventing many seniors from accessing critical programs and support. Older adults can be especially reluctant to seek help or admit they are experiencing behavioral health challenges, espec ially those in specific demographic groups. Stigma is often associated with behavioral health conditions due to cultural factors, historical trauma and mistrust. Some Native American elders will opt to use traditional medicines and healing practices rath er than seeking care for their behavioral health needs at a hospital or clinic. Many seniors experiencing homelessness fear that they will be judged by their hygiene and turned away from services. They also fear a lack of understanding from those providi ng needed health care services. Many LGBTQ+ seniors will seek services only when they absolutely need to because of fear of judgment and their needs not being understood by health care staff and providers. Some LGBTQ+ seniors feel they may be shamed, which leads them to share less about their health histories wi th providers.

In addition, Sharp Insight Community Survey participants ages 65 and older expressed COVID -19 had at least minorly impacted them i n the following ways: increased financial uncertainty (33%) , increased housing instability or risk of homelessness (10%) and increased unemployment (9%). Please see Sharp's Economic Stability findin gs for more information on this topic. Social Isolation Through the IPH Sharp Provider Survey, increased isolation among seniors was identified as one of the top needs most seriously impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic in the past year. Respondents were nearly unanimous (98%) that COVID -19 had a moderate or major impact on the isolation of seniors/older adults. Respondents also noted that COVID -19 made it more difficult to have contact with family and to have family at the bedside, which is especially important for highly vulnerable patients, such as those with de mentia. Survey participants had the opportunity to choose among specific populations that were most impacted by COVID -19 in relation to increased isolation among seniors ; caregivers of adults or older adult s were the most frequently selected population . The racial or ethnic groups most frequently identified as being most impacted in relation to isolation of seniors/older adults included Black/African American, Hispanic and Multiracial. Survey respondents were divided about whether Sharp has programs that help address increased isolation among seniors; 44% indicated yes and 56% indicated no. Examples provided by respondents of Sharp's existing efforts to address increased isolation among seniors/older adult s included educational efforts, outreach and referrals for resources and support, the Sharp Senior Resource Center , and increased use of telehealth. Further, 70% of Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents age s 65 and older reported experiencing at l east a minor increase in isolation or decrease in access to social support due to COVID -19. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 90 Access to Health Care Sharp Insight Community Survey participants ages 65 and older reported that COVID - 19 had caused at least a minor decrease in their access to the following types of care: in-person medical care (52%); in -person behavioral health care (17%); and medications or medical supplies (12%). Half of participants ages 65 and ol der reported increased fear of using health care services, and approximately one -quarter (22%) felt they experienced increased stigma in the health care setting due to COVID -19. In addition, Sharp Insight Community Survey participants were asked about t heir use of telehealth services in the past year. Findings from those age s 65 and older included the following: 41% reported they had interacted with a Sharp professional (physician, nurse, etc.) through a video visit and 36% reported they had interacte d through an audio -only visit. Of those who had virtual visits, 81% reported their video visit as \"effective\" in addressing their health needs while 71% reported their audio visit as \"effective\" in addressing their health needs. Overall, 70% reported the y \"liked\" their telehealth visit (either video or audio) while 30% \"disliked\" their visit. Compared to other age groups, th e survey found an association between being ages 65 and older and liking one's telehealth visit. Access to Community Resources and Support IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants had the opportunity to choose among specific populations who have been particularly impacted by COVID -19 in relation to limited access to emotional or social support ; Caregivers of adults or older adults were the most frequently selected population. Hispanic, Multiracial, Black/African American and Asian patients were the racial and ethni c groups noted to be especially impacted by COVID -19 in relation to limited access to emotional or social support. In addition, 70% of Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents age s 65 and older reported at least a minor increase in isolation or decrease in access to social support due to COVID -19. Respondents in this age group also reported dec reased access to healthy food (15%), transportation (20%) and community resources (10%) as a result of COVID -19. Among all age groups, the majority of Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents (96%) did not participate in Sharp's programs designed to support older adults, their caregivers and loved ones with aging concerns. Those who did participate named caregiver or family support programs, senior health education , and the Sharp Senior Resource Center as the most used programs. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 91 Behavioral Health IPH Sharp Provider Survey participants noted caregivers of adults or older adults as being especially impacted by COVID -19 in relation to increased anxiety and depression and decreased access to behavioral health care . In addition, due to COVID -19, more than half (53%) of Sharp Insight Community Survey participants ages 65 and older reported at least a minor increase in their anxiety or depression , and 17% experienced at least a minor decrease in their access to in -person behavioral health care. It is also worth noting that Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents ages 65 and older were more likely to participate in behavioral health programs compared to respondents from other age groups. Analysis of hospital discharge data for SMH showed that nearly a third (30.3%) of seniors admitted to the hospital in 2020 had a mental, behavioral or neurodevelopmental disorder. Among this group, 40.8% were diagnosed with a depressive disorder, while 28.6% were diagnosed with an anxiety and fear -related disorder.5 Please see Sharp's Behavioral Health findings for more information. Other Health and Safety Concerns5 According to SMH hospital discharge data , seniors ages 65 and older accounted for 48.1% of all inpatient discharges, and 22.3% of ED encounters at the hospital in 2020 . The top three princip al diagnoses among senior inpatients at SMH in 2020 were classified as (10.3%), cardiac dysrhythmias (4.0%) and heart failure ( 3.9%). The top three principal diagnoses among seniors who visited the ED at SMH in 2020 were classified as nonspecific chest pain ( 5.6%), other unspecified injury (5.1%) and abdominal pain (4. 8%). While nearly half (45.9%) of senior inpatients at S MH in 2020 wer e discharged to their homes (routine discharge), many others required additional support or a higher level of care upon discharge, such as home health care (23.0%) or transfer to a SNF ( 18.0%). In 2020, seniors represented 47.0% of inpatient discharges for unintentional injury at SMH, with fall -related injuries occurring in 47.3% of those discharges. Nearly all ( 86.5%) of seniors admitted to SMH in 2020 had a disease of the circulatory system. Among this group, nearly half ( 44.8%) were diagnosed with essent ial hypertension, while 39.9% were diagnosed with cardiac dysrhythmias and 34.9% were diagnosed with heart failure . More than half ( 56.8%) of SMH inpatients with a diabetes diagnosis in 2020 were seniors. Seniors represented 68.6% of inpatient discharges with an osteoarthritis diagnosis at SMH in 2020.

Behavioral Health findings are most notably described in relation to the health , social and population -specific challenges listed below . In addition, the CHNA findings highlight the profound impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on community members' mental well -being and their ability to access needed b ehavioral health care. Increasing behavioral health needs Increasing substance use Access to behavioral health care Stigma Post-acute care concerns Dual diagnosis patients LGBTQ+ People experiencing homelessness Veterans and military Other populations (Native American/Tribal, refugees , undocumented) Workforce challenges Behavioral Health findings are described below for both the HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs. Please see the Access to Health Care , Aging Care & Support , and Children & Youth Well -Being findings for additional data related to behavioral health. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA Increasing Behavioral Health Needs The pandemic took a substantial toll on the community's mental health. There was universal agreement among community engagement participants that mental and behavioral health needs in the community increased dramatically during this time . The pandemic disrupted daily routines , and factors such as economic hardship, uncertainty, social isolation and loneliness, and loss of a loved one contributed to the Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 93 growing prevalence of behavioral health disorders and a greater need for treatment. These stressors led to unprecedented increases in stress, anxie ty, depression and trauma , especially for people with pre -existing behavioral health conditions . As the demand for behavioral health services soared, the capacity of behavioral health programs and services fell increasingly short. Community -based service providers and health care providers expressed a feeling of heartbreak as they worked with community members who were in desperate need of behavioral health care. Providers experienced the community's desperation but were unable to address all their immedi ate needs \u2014 there was almost no availability for timely access to services. See Figure 22 below for a representation of the decline in mental health service utilization during the onset of the pandemic. Figure 22: Dramatically Decreased Mental Health Service Utilization Early in Pandemic105 Some data showed a decline in behavioral health service utilization (visits) during the first two years of the pandemic, but providers cautioned that this does not accurately represent the growing needs of the community. Challenges such as provider capacity and barriers hindered people from accessing and receiving necessary behavioral health care. In HASD&IC's online community survey , 70% of respondents identified behavioral health as a top health need. Wh en asked more specifically about behavioral health needs, respondents identified the following as the 10 most important mental or behavioral health needs in the community (in ranked order): depression; access to help; anxiety; stress; drug use; substance s (SUD alcohol use; burnout or fatigue; opioid use (including Fentanyl); and suicide or suicidal thoughts. 105 AHA (2022), TrendWatch: The impacts of the COVID -19 pandemic on behavioral health. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 94 Public health measures and flexibilities to protect community health allowed for a shift toward telehealth adoption to increase access to behavioral health services. However, telehealth was identified as an inadequate option for people with a higher acuity level who needed in -person care. With reimbursement -related restrictions on telehealth loosened, providers conducted 75% of behavioral health visits for commercially insured patients via telehealth in May and June 2020.105 A 2021 American Psychological Association survey of more than 1,100 psychologists found a significant increase in the demand for behavioral health treatment. Among their patients, 84% of providers reported increase s in anxiety, 72% reported increases in depressio n, and 62% reported increase s in trauma and stress -related disorders.106 Increasing Substance Use Community members expressed concern about the increased use of substances to cope with stress and anxiety caused by the pandemic, such as loss of income or employment, or social isolation. Community members experiencing anxiety and depression often self-medicat ed with subs tances, such as drugs and alcohol, further exacerbating their behavioral health conditions. SAMHSA data indicates that, in 2019, 20 million Americans ages 12 or older attested to having SUD s, which are characterized by alcohol use, illicit drug use, or b oth.105 Fentanyl -related overdose and death were identified by interviewees as a large area of concern due to its potency , lethality and increased presence in the community. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine.107,108 Powdered fentanyl resembles a variety of other substances that are taken recreationally. There have been recent reports of substances such as heroin, cocaine and meth being mixed (\"cut\") with it, and the end -product looks like other commonly consumed drug s. Interviewees shared that , in many cases, people do not know that their drugs are laced with fentanyl and consume it unknowingly, leading to accidental overdose or death. An area of concern expressed by c ommunity members was the increased consumption of alcohol. During the pandemic , uncertainty combined with disruption of routines, financial instability, and balancing work and sometimes childcare from home may have led some people to progress into heavier drinking habits or increase their overall alcoho l consumption. People with SUDs were suddenly isolated due to the pandemic, which increased the risk of solitary drug use and relapse. Social distancing measures impacted community 106 American Psychological Association (2021), 2021 COVID -19 Practitioner Survey. 107 Wilson, N., Kariisa , M., Seth, P., Smith IV, H., & Davis, N.L.

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 95 members who strongly preferred in -person individual or group therapy sessi ons. Unresolved or unaddressed behavioral health issues created pressure that led some community members to relapse. According to research from Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) ,109 the number of unintentional drug overdose deaths in SDC has increased since 2015. Most unintentional overdose deaths were opioid -related, and those numbers increased from 2015 to 2019. Research from OD2A also identified different demographic profiles for opioid -related events. Higher opioid -related mortality and ED visits were observed in younger populations , and males tended to have higher rates of ED visits and deaths. More than 840,000 Americans died of a drug overdose between 1999 and 2020, and millions more have been affected by other adverse health and social consequences of SUDs, including injury, infectious diseases and incarceration.110 According to data from the County of San Diego Medical Examiner's Office that was compiled and visualized by the San Diego Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force , unintentional prescription -caused deaths and Fentanyl -caused deaths have been steadily increasing over the years (see Figure 23).111 However, i t is important to note that not all deaths from Fentanyl are captured in these numbers \u2014 they may actually be undercount ed. From 2019 to 2020, there was a 206% increa se in the number of Fentanyl - caused deaths \u2014 151 compared to 462, respectively. From 2019 to 2020, there was a 109% increase in unintentional prescription - caused deaths \u2014 275 compared to 576, respectively. 109 County of San Diego HHSA (2021), Opioid -Related Overdoses & Encounters In San Diego 110 Saloner, B., Li, W., Bandara, S.N., McGinty, E.E., & Barry, C.L.

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 96 Figure 23: Unintentional Prescription -Caused Deaths in SDC to Care Challenges HASD&IC 2022 CHNA findings revealed the need for a robust, fully coordinated and integrated continuum of behavioral health care . Service deficits are causing severe consequences to the overall health and well -being of the community, especially for people with existing chronic behavioral health conditions. The pand emic further exacerbated existing barriers to accessing services , particularly for populations who were already experiencing inequities . Community members expressed desperation in their inability to find help and often felt hopeless as they grappled with t he lack of available resources. Community engagement participants identified severe deficits within the behavioral health continuum of care. People who do not have access to comprehensive mental and behavioral health services are at an increased risk of crisis. Community members expressed that there is an urgent need to improve access to early intervention services. Participants cited several k ey challenges and barriers that cause delays or deter people from accessing necessary care and treatment including: extremely long wait times or waitlists; unaffordable treatment and services; health insurance provider limitations and coverage conflicts; access to technology; and transportation. Long waits for appointments and treatment were a consistent concern. People often wait six months or longer for critically necessary mental and behavioral health services. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 97 Waiting for treatment has a significant impact on people who are in crisis and need immediate help. Ongoing behavioral health treatment and therapy can be very costly. Affordability was commonly cited as a barrier, especially during the pandemic as people were experiencing more economic hardship. Most health plans have a limited numbe r of in -network providers available for their members. Many community members with health insurance are unable to find someone in their network and must seek costly treatment from out -of-network providers. Additionally, provider director ies are often inacc urate or list providers who are no longer accepting patients. Medi -Cal coverage for beneficiaries diagnosed with Mild to Moderate Mental Illness is separate from Medi -Cal coverage for beneficiaries diagnosed with Serious Mental Illness. When the health p lans disagree about the patient's diagnosis, there can be delays in referrals and access to needed treatment. Patients with private health insurance also face denials for needed treatment. Lack of access to internet, computers and cellphones were frequen tly cited as barriers to accessing telehealth appointments. Transportation to appointments was an issue for people without cars, or for anyone without reliable transportation. Public transportation was described as time-consuming and difficult to navigat e. Transportation impacts a person's ability to continue any ongoing treatment or attend therapy. Stigma69 For community members with behavioral health disorders, stigma was identified as a pervasive issue impacting their overall health, well -being and quality of life. Stigma can cause people to delay or avoid seeking any help, including treatment and recovery. Several populations \u2014 including people of color, LGBTQ+, people experiencing homelessness, undocumented immigrants, refugees and Native American or tribal communities \u2014 experience stigma more frequently, creating additional challenges when they seek behavioral health care services. Figure 24 includes several different types of stigma surrounding people with a behavioral health condition. Most notably, cultural stigma was identified as a s ignificant barrier to people openly talking about their problems and seeking professional help. People with behavioral health needs are more likely to internalize their feelings due to negative cultural beliefs around behavioral health and any experiences with longstanding history of discrimination in the health care system. Particularly for people of color, seeking behavioral health care is often viewed as shameful, unacceptable or a sign of weakness. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 98 Figure 24: Types of Stigma112 The National Alliance for Mental Illness (NAMI) has identified stigma as a priority concern. The StigmaFree campaign is NAMI's effort to end stigma and create hope for those affected by mental illness.113 Fifteen years ago, a U.S. Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health \u2014 the first and only one to date \u2014 identified stigma as a public health concern that leads people to \"avoid living, socializing or working with, renting to or employing \" individuals with mental illness. Due to stigma, people living with mental health conditions are often : alienated and seen as \"others ;\" perceived as dangerous ; seen as irresponsible or unable to make their own decisions ; less likely to be hired or obtain safe housing ; more likely to be criminalized than offered health care services ; and a fraid of rejection to the point that they don't always pursue opportunities. Post-Acute Care Concerns The insufficient availability of post -acute services acro ss the board has created a bottleneck, with people waiting several months to a year to receive the appropriate level of care, especially after a hospital stay. Hospital staff are significantly challenged in finding timely follow -up care or a safe place to discharge people with complex behavioral health needs. These longstanding challenges became even worse during the pandemic. For patients recently discharged from acute or long -term care, any progress achieved during their stay may be diminished if they hav e long wait times to access the appropriate level of care. The most significant deficit in the post -acute care continuum is long-term care beds. Figure 25 below categorizes the level of need for the different types of post -acute behavioral health services. 112 White Hughto , J. M., Reisner, S. L., & Pachankis, J. E. (2015).

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 99 Figure 25: Adult Behavioral Health Post -Acute Care Continuum - Needed Services Dual Diagnosis Patients An estimated 500,000 Californians have a dual diagnosis of mental illness and a SUD.114 One in three people (33%) with a SUD has a co -occurring mental health condition. One in five people (20%) with a severe mental health disorder will also develop a SUD. Only 1 in 13 people (7.4%) with dual diagnoses receives treatment for both conditions. Community engagement participants shared the incredible challenges faced by comm unity members with a dual diagnosis. Managing a dual diagnosis is especially 114 CHCF (2021), In Their Own Words: How Fragmented Care Harms Pe ople with Both Mental Illness and Substance Use Disorder. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 100 complex because the systems of care for mental illness and substance use are separate. LGBTQ+ The LGBTQ+ community is at a higher risk of significant behavioral health inequiti es due to lack of social support, increased discrimination, stigma and trauma. LGBTQ+ community members frequently use substances to cope with stress and trauma. Transgender community members face unique challenges, such as gender dysphoria , which could le ad to anxiety, depression and self -harm. Fear of stigmatization and the lack of experienced , safe, gender -affirming care providers create additional barriers to accessing behavioral health care. Rates of chronic depression among transgender people are mo re than double those of cisgender populations and estimates of the prevalence of depression among transgender women are as high as 64.2%.115 People Experiencing Homelessness The experience of being homeless is traumatic and stressful. When unhoused commun ity members live in unsafe conditions, the trauma they endure can further exacerbate their behavioral health conditions. For both ED and inpatient discharges of patients experiencing homelessness in SDC in 2019 , half of the top 10 primary diagnosis codes were related to behavioral health. See Figures 26 and 27. Community members experiencing homelessness frequently avoid seeking medical attention until their situation becomes a crisis, such as a mental breakdown or e xtreme psychosis. Once someone is in crisis, the ED is often the only option for accessing care. There are generally no resources or services available in a timely manner for stabilized patients experiencing homelessness who are ready to be discharged, mak ing post - acute care and treatment nearly impossible. Health and social service providers emphasized the importance of timeliness in getting appointments and being linked to services in the community. In addition, community members experiencing homelessne ss face navigation barriers with long waitlists for services like case management. 115 National Institutes of Health (2022), Women's Health in Focus at NIH: Transgender Women's Health.

Fracture of the lower limb (except hip) Veterans and Military Compared to their civilian counterparts , veterans experience behavioral health disorders, SUDs , post -traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury at disproportionate rates. It is estimated that 18 to 22 American veterans die by suicide each day and young veterans age s 18 to 44 are at highest risk.116 Despite reporting better overall health than their civilian counterparts, women who have served are more likely to face behavioral health challenges. In fact, women who have 116 Olenick, M., Flowers, M., & Diaz, V. J. (2015). US veterans and their unique issues: Enhancing h ealth care professional awareness. Advances in Medical Education and Practice , 6, 635 -639. https://doi.org/10.2147/AMEP.S89479 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 102 served have a 42 % higher rate of having experienced a mental illness in the past year than those who have not served. Further, women who have served are more likely to be diagnosed with depression and have suicidal thoughts than civilian women.117 Unfortunately, the reluctance of veterans to seek treatment or help makes diagnosing and treating mental illness difficult.116 Other Populations ( Native American/Tribal , Refugees , Undocumented ) HASD&IC community engagement participants shared that Native American community members have experienced multiple types of trauma which may deter some from seeking needed treatment. They also shared that the most serious behavioral health concerns for Native Ameri can community members include SUDs and suicide prevention. Members of SDC's refugee community may have endured harrowing experiences that can cause long -lasting behavioral health consequences. Many have survived traumatic circumstances, such as witness ing deaths, starvation or violence in their homeland. Simultaneously attempting to process their experiences while adjusting to a new language and a different everyday life can furthe r impact their behavioral health. Refugee community members may also face cultural stigma when seeking behavioral health care. Receiving behavioral health treatment with the assistance of a translator can feel traumatizing or invasive to an individual's privacy. Community members emphasized that building trust with behavioral health providers takes time. This is a challenge when most insurance coverage limits the number of appointments per year. Policies in place during the previous administration and pa ndemic -related stressors have caused undocumented community members to experience stigma, trauma and severe anxiety. CBOs and providers shared the frustration of not being able to connect undocumented community members to behavioral health services and tre atments due to their cost without health coverage. Additionally, language differences and the lack of culturally competent behavioral health providers were barriers for people to feel safe and comfortable in disclosing their personal experiences as an undo cumented individual. Workforce Challenges Behavioral health providers, social service providers, and community members consistently expressed feelings of exhaustion and burnout. Every provider was stretched to their absolute limits. There are severe behavioral health staffing shortages across the continuum, particularly in clinical settings. Outpatient behavioral health clinicians are moving into private practice or moving out of SDC . The pre -existing shortage of inpatient behavioral health 117 Military Officers Association of America (2017), Health of Women Who have Served. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 103 clinicians was greatly exacerbated by the pandemic. There is no labor force to replace those who have left. Even in situations where new graduates could be brought in , they often lacked the experience or training necessary to prepare them for the in tensive and complex care required by patients in severe crisis. Due to the nature of the work, health care providers experienced vicarious trauma,93 compassion fatigue and secondary traumatic stress. Health care providers carry many of their patients ' stories and are constantly exposed to their traumatic experiences (both physical and psychological). Some clinicians drew parallels between health care providers working at the frontline of the pandemic and veterans who have served on the frontlines in combat. Research has found that frontline health providers during the pandemic report similar outcomes of depression, self -reported quality of life a nd burnout as combat veterans . Military conflicts and pandemic health care work have fundamental differences, but both have presented many people with morally damaging experiences, which in turn are associated with substantial psychological distress .118 See Appendix M for individual quotes from HASD&IC's community engagement interview and focus group participants regarding the identified community need of Behavioral Health. In addition, the complete results of HASD&IC's online community engagement survey are available within the Health Needs Participants in the IPH Sharp Provider Survey identified increased anxiety and depression as be ing among the top community needs most seriously impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic in the past year. Nearly all respondents agreed that COVID -19 had either a mod erate or major impact on rates of anxiety (98%) and depression (96%). Those noted as being most impacted by COVID -19 in relation to increased anxiety included caregivers of adults or older adults, patients using Medi -Cal or Medicare, those with LEP, and pregnant women. The racial or ethnic groups reported as being most impac ted by COVID -19 in relation to increased anxiety included Hispanic, Black/African American and white. More than half (64%) of respondents believed Sharp has not established programs to address increased anxiety. Those noted as being most impacted by COVI D-19 in relation to increased depression included caregivers of adults or older adults, patients using Medi -Cal or Medicare, and 118 Nieuwsma , J.A., H., Smigelsky, M.A., Workgroup, HERO Research Program, & Meador, K.G.

DOI: 10.1007/s11606 -022-07487 -4 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 104 those with LEP. Hispanic individuals were identified as being especially affected by increased depression due to COVID -19, as well as Black/African American , Multiracial and Asian individuals . Further, t wo-thirds of survey respondents suggested that Sharp has not implemented programs or services to help address increased depression. Among respondents to the Sharp Insight C ommunity Survey, 64% indicated that increased anxiety or depression had a t least a minor impact on the community due to COVID -19. According to internal data analysis conducted for Sharp's 2022 over 38,000 individuals as inpatients with a behavioral health diagnosis. This is a steady increase year -over-year from FY 2016. This increase is likely the result of both improved documentation and actual disease prevalence in the community. See Figures 28 and 29 below. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 105 Figure 28: Behavioral Health Disorders among Sharp's Acute Inpatients, FY 2016 -2021 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 106 Figure 29: Behavioral Health Disorders among Sharp's Acute Inpatients, Specific Conditions, FY 2016 -2021 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 107 Access to Behavioral Health Care According to the IPH Sharp Provider Survey, limited access to behavioral health services and limited access to emotional and social support were among the top clinical and social needs most seriously impacted by COVID -19 in the past year. The vast majority of survey respondents indicated that COVID -19 had a moderate or major impact on limiting access to behavioral health care (91%) and access to emotional or social support (e.g., support groups) (95%). Survey respondents indicated that the populations who have been especially affected by COVID -19 in relation to limited access to behavioral health care include patients utilizing Medi -Cal and Medicare and patients with LEP, as well as Hispanic, Black/Afric an American, and Multiracial individuals . More than half (57%) of survey respondents believed Sharp has not implemented programs or services to address limited access to behavioral health care. Further, m ost respondents (71%) indicated that Sharp has not implemented services to address limited access to emotional or social support. Virtual support groups were the only example offered about Sharp's efforts taken to address access to emotional or social support. Among respondents to the Sharp Insight Community Survey , 25% reported that decreased access to in -person behavioral health care due to COVID -19 had at least a minor impact on the community . In addition, 71% of participants reported that increased isolation or decreased access to social support had at least a minor impact on the community due to COVID -19. The majority of Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents (95%) did not participate in Sharp 's behavioral health program offerings . Those who did participate were more likely to be age 65 or older . Workforce Challenges IPH Sharp Human Resources Survey participants identified increased anxiety or stress as the most significant issue impacting Sharp team members during the past year (93%). Respondents were unanimous (100%) that Shar p has implemented programs and services to help employees with increased anxiety or stress.

The f indings for Children & Youth Well -Being are most often described in relation to the health and social issues below . Overwhelming, t he findings also emphasize the behavioral health needs of children and youth , and the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on their overall health and well -being. Increasing behavioral health needs Resource and service deficits in behavioral health Behavioral health workforce shortages Physical health Childcare and early education Early childhood development Education challenges Housing and economic stability for youth Safety concerns Sexual exploitation Children & Youth Well -Being findings are described below for both the HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA Increasing Behavioral Health Needs In October 2021, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) and Children's Hospital Association (CHA) declared a national emergency in children's mental health. \"Children and families across ou r country have experienced enormous adversity and disruption. The inequities that result from structural racism have contributed to disproportionate impacts on children from communities of color,\" according to the AAP, AACAP and CHA.119 A few months later, the U.S. Surgeon General issued an Advisory on Protecting Youth Mental Health, which outlines the pandemic's unprecedented impact on the behavioral health of America's youth and families and the challenges that existed long before the pandemic. 119 American Academy of Pediatrics (2021), AAP-AACAP -CHA Declaration of a National Emergency in Child and Adolescent Mental Health. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 109 It is estimated that as of June 2021, more than 140,000 children in the U.S. had lost a parent or grandparent caregiver to COVID -19. In 2019, before the pandemic, 1 in 3 high school students and half of female students reported persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, an overall increase of 40% from 2009. Socioeconomically disadvantaged children and adolescents are two to three times more likely to develop behavioral health conditions than peers with higher socioeconomic status.120 HASD&IC's online community survey included the following question: \"What most worries you about the health and well -being of children in our communit y?\" Responses are listed in Figure 30 below, grouped into five major categories. The concerns of the 502 survey respondents echoed much of the feedback gathered during the focus groups and interviews \u2014 the top concerns were related to the mental well - being of children and youth. The next high est areas of concern were around community safety. Figure 30: HASD&IC Online Community Survey Response - Top Concer ns for Children's Health & Well -Being 120 U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (2021), U.S. Surgeon General Issues Advisory on Youth Mental Health Crisis Further Exposed by COVID -19 Pandemic. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 110 The pandemic has had both temporary and long -term impacts on children's behavioral health, leading to an increased need for behavioral health services and support. Clinicians and community members agreed that the top behavioral health challenges among children and youth are anxiety and depression. There was also grave concern about children with autism and ADHD . Factors that have contributed to increased demand for behavioral health services and support include: bullying , lack of activities , social isolation , social media , and s tress due to family and financial circumstances These factors have translate d to a greater number of children seeking crisis mental health services at EDs across the county. Clinicians shared additional factors related to the increase in ED access , includ ing involvement with the justice system and parents seeking respite. Children with disabilities may have more serious unmet needs, and their access to care was severely limited by the pandemic. Populations described as being most vulnerable include children with physical and developmental disabilities, children diagnosed with social -emotional disturb ances , children with educational accommodations and children in special education programs. Early in the pandemic, m any families were forced to cancel in -home se rvices due to the risk of exposure. Therapy accessed virtually may not always be appropriate for younger children or those who are nonverbal. Hospital EDs have reported an alarming increase in psychiatric crises among children and youth . For example, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego reported a 1,746% increase from 2011 to 2019.121 In 2019, as many as six youth per day were treated for attempted suicide in local EDs. Also in 2019, depressive disorders were the most frequent principal diagnosis among hospital inpatients 17 years or younger .122 Although recent countywide data show an overall decrease in teen suicide deaths, there was an increase in 2020 among both Asian/Pacific Islander and Hispanic teens (see Figure 31). In addition, there has been a significant number of attempted suicides and increasing concern about suicidality in youth. Clinicians shared their experiences treating youth who are heavily influenced by content they find online and stated that social media has normalized suicide as an option for youth who are struggl ing with mental and behavioral health challenges. They described an inability for some youth to cope \u2014 something as seemingly minor as a parent taking away a child's cellphone could trigger a mental health crisis. 121 Rady Children's Transforming Mental Health Initiative, Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego and San Diego Center for Children (2021).

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 111 Figure 31: Teen Suicide s in SDC , 2020123 One positive result of the pandemic was that some children and youth became more comfortable asking for help. In the survey and in interviews , many mentioned that the stigma surrounding behavioral health has been reduced. Youth are more open about their mental state and open to seeking help. Unfortunately, for many other youth, the stigma remains. Aside from the difficulties that behavioral health conditions present for young people , there is also the issue of social or cultural stigma within families. Many youth are discouraged from seeking professional help because of blame, guilt or shame, combined with a lack of understanding from family. This makes it difficult to have support from family memb ers, a lack of which can harm or worsen these conditions over time. Without familial support, early behavioral health intervention and the recovery process may be jeopardized. Resource and Service Deficits in Behavioral Health Frustration and hopelessnes s about the dire lack of available behavioral health resources and services for children was expressed consistently in HASD&IC's community engagement process . 123 County of San Diego HHSA (2021), Suicide in San Diego County, 2020: Suicide Prevention Council Annual Stakeholders Meeting. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 112 Screening & Assessment Outpatient Mental Health In-Home Therapy Wrap Around care Mobile Crisis Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP) Residential (including emergency shelter) Urgent Care Inpatient Crisis Stabilization Unit/ Emergency Stabilzation Unit Emergency Dept (Physical Assessment Only)There is a significant gap in both screening and services for school -aged children (5 to 12). Sc hools don't have enough therapists, and even if there were more therapists, some clinicians shared that pulling children out of class isn't always a good solution. There is stigma associated with being pulled from class. Additionally, in -school therapy takes time away from classroom studies. In SDC , approximately half of all children (325,747 as of April 2022) are enrolled in Medi -Cal.124 Children enrolled in Medi -Cal often have additional risk factors that increase their need for mental and behavioral health treatments and interventions. Unfortunately, there is a significant gap between the behavioral health services that are needed to treat children and prevent them from reaching a crisis or acute state and the services that are covered by children's Medi -Cal. Figure 32 below describes Medi -Cal's mental health continuum of care for children.125 Figure 32: Medi -Cal Managed Care Mental Heal th Continuum of Care for Children125 One result of the serious deficits within the regional continuum of care is the increase in children and youth in crisis who are presenting at local EDs. While an inpatient acute care bed may be the needed level of care for some , others would benefit from crisis residential services or partial hospitalization programs where they could remain at 124 County of San Diego HHSA (2022), Eligibility Services by the Numbers Report: April 2022. 125 Graphic created by HASD&IC (2022) using data from the San Diego Center for Children. Covered by Medi -Cal Not Covered by Medi -Cal Continuum of Care Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 113 home. With long waitlists for community -based programs, many children and youth end up making repeated visits to the ED, even if they do not require hospital -level c are. Community -based services often lack the capacity to take on additional clients to provide the ongoing care that is needed. There is a lack of specialized programs focused on the comprehensive needs of families as they support a child with a behavior al health diagnosis . The lack of family support manifests frequently in EDs. Parents in need of respite sometimes feel like they don't have other options and will drop their children off at the ED to receive treatment and supervision. Some children remain at the ED without a parent for days at a time. In recent years, there has been an increase in volume at SDC's only emergency shelter for children. Post -shelter placement options are extremely limited. As a result, children who need high levels of care often end up in a 10 -day treatment or another short -term placement . Youth receiving treatment at the emergency shelter often leave without permission and then require medical clearance to return. In some instances, clinicians reported seeing the same youth s leaving and returning to the shelter each day for over a week. Behavioral Health Workforce Shortages The workforce shortage has had a devastating impact on access to mental and behavioral health services for children and youth. There are deficits in the continuum of care for children of all ages, but the need for early childhood mental health providers, specifically those who see child -welfare involved children , is particularly acute. It is important to note that programs created for adults are not appropriate for children and youth. Pediatric providers must have special ized training to provide effective care for child ren and youth who need behavioral health treatment. Hospital -based and community -based clinicians serving children and youth consistently stated that reducing bureaucratic burdens like reporting requirements would increase clinicians ' time and allow them t o serve more clients. Physical Health Rates of c hildhood immunizations, including papillomavirus, are down significantly compared to pre-pandemic times. The risk of COVID -19 exposure and infection may have kept some families from seeking routine pediatric care for their children. Reports from early in the pandemic revealed a significant decrease in vaccine administration for children and youth.126 This decline may have been worsened by the shift to online learning from in -person schooling, where 126 Patel Murthy, B., Zell, E., et al. (2021). Impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on administration of selected routine childhood and adolescent vaccinations \u2014 10 U.S. jurisdictions, March -September 2020. MMWR Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report , 7, 840- 845. DOI: http://dx.doi.org /10.15585/mmwr.mm7023a2 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 114 immunizations are generally required to attend.127 Even catch -up immunizations for children and youth are falling behind, which has serious implications. A decline in routine vaccinations could l ead to an increase in death or disability due to the emergence of vaccine -preventable diseases. According to preliminary data shared by the County of San Diego HHSA's Epidemiology and Immunization Services Branch, there was a decline in the total number o f routine childhood immunizations administered in SDC for most months from March through December 2020, compared to the same month s in 2019. The greatest impact was seen during the stay -at-home order in April 2020, with a 26% decline in vaccinations among children ages 0 to 5, and a 79% decline among those ages 6 to 18. Total vaccinations by month showed some rebounds in 2021 with some months surpassing 2019 totals , which may be attributed to catch -up vaccinations. In addition, s ome community members exper ienced high levels of inactivity and isolation due to stay -at-home orders associated with the pandemic, which may have lasting impacts on children 's social and physical health. A study of over 430,000 children ages 2 to 19 years found that body mass index increased nearly two -fold during the COVID -19 pandemic when compared to a pre -pandemic period.128 Childcare and Early Education The gap between the need and the availability of childcare has been a growing concern, and the pandemic created new challenges for both parents and childcare providers. Community members shared that finding affordable, quality childcare that met the needs of parents was increasingly difficult. Multiple recent studies conducted in SDC demonstrate how many families are struggling. High-quality early education and childcare for young children provides significant benefits, including physical and cognitive improvements and enhanced school readiness.129 An analysis of childcare supply and demand found that nearly half (48%) of children age s 5 and under have parents who work and have no available licensed childcare option , while 69% of children in that age group need childcare and are income eligible for a subsidy but not enrolled in a subsidized childcare program . In addition, over three -quarters (76%) of parents with children under 6 said finding affordable childcare in their a rea is an issue and 70% had difficulty finding childcare that meets their expectations. 127 Czeisler, M.\u00c9., Marynak, K., Clarke K.E., et al.

Pediatrics , 140(2). ht tps://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2017 -1488 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 115 Research suggests that early childhood education is important for a variety of reasons, and positive interventions are evident even after participants reach adu lthood.130 For example: Early childhood education has been shown to lower the rate of special education placement by 10%.131 Children who participated in high -quality early childhood education had increased rates of four-year high school graduation, college attend ance, associate's or higher college degree attainment and postsecondary degree attainment132 and higher employment rates at age 30.133 Participants also showed long -term health benefits, including reduced rates of depression, smoking and cardiovascular disease ,134 which can lead to lower health care costs \u2014 resulting in a 13% return on investment for these programs.133 Parents with children who participated in high -quality early childhood education saw sustained parental wage growth.135 Early Childhood Development HASD&IC's communit y engagement participants shared numerous concerns related to infants and young children. Resources to identify and treat developmental challenges were limited prior to the pandemic and are now critically scarce. During the early part of the pandemic, there were significantly fewer screenings available through regular check -ups or childcare. This has led to many children either not receiving or waiting months for diagnosis and treatment. Clinicians shared that there are specific challenges in diagnosing young children. Under the a ge of 5, behavioral health and development for children are often intertwined. Developmental c oncerns or delays (such as speech, hearing or gross motor skills) may often manifest as behavioral challenges, and vice -versa. Successful diagnosis for infants o r young children requires significant time. Clinicians need to understand whether the challenges they are seeing are development -related (such as autism) or effects of trauma exposure. Research shows that 85% of maltreated children under 3 have a moderate to high risk for developmental delays.136 In addition, ACEs can have long-term effects on children's health and well -being. The CDC describes ACEs as potentially traumatic events that occur during childhood ( ages 0 to 17 years). Examples include child abuse (physical, sexual or emotional); child 130 Cannon, J.

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 116 neglect ( physical neglect and inadequate supervision, or emotional, medical or educational neglect); and childhood trauma (witnessing violence in the home or neighborhood, substance use, m ental health challenges in the home, instability from parental separation or household member incarceration).137 Children who experience ACEs are at increased risk for long -term health problems that span behavioral, emotional and physical wellness , which also can affect education, employment and income levels. As the body responds to the toxic stress associated with ACEs, the hormone cortisol is in constant production and has a negative impact on neurological development as well as organs and tissues in the body. As a person's ACE score increases, their risk of these negative health outcomes increases.138 ACEs Aware , California's first -in-the-nation effort to screen patients for ACEs to help improve and save lives notes that not all stressors are toxic \u2014 some are important for growth and development. For example, positive stress can include brief periods of responding to a routine stressor such as a test or competition. Tolerable stress is also a form of positive stress that is limited in time and buffere d by connections with adults who help the child adapt and recover from an event , such as a natural disaster.139 ACEs are common and the effects can accumulate over time. CDC research suggests that 6 1% of adults have had at least one ACE and 16% have experi enced four or more types of ACEs. Females and several racial/ethnic minority gro ups a re at greater risk of experiencing four or more ACEs. Further, c hildren living in under -resourced or racially segregated neighborhoods, who move frequently , or who experie nce food insecurity can be exposed to toxic stress and increased ACEs.140 ACEs can create a generational cycle in which the children of parents with ACEs are more likely to experience ACEs. Traumatic events \"rewire\" the brain to operate in fight or flight response. This response can hinder executive functions that include attentional control, working memory, inhibition and problem -solving.141 Figure 33 below lists health conditions by age that are associated with ACEs. 137 Childhelp.

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 117 Figure 33: ACEs Associated with Health Conditions by Age139 Being aware of ACEs and their effects and dedicating resources to early interventions can make a significant impact on the trajectory of a child's life. This is because the brain has the ability to adapt and heal by creating new connections. This can be supported in an environme nt where a child has healthy, safe and nurturing relationships with caregivers as well as high -quality childcare, early childhood education, financial and housing stability and parental employment. TIC is essential to effectively provid e care to people af fected by ACEs. Instead of asking what is \"wrong \" with a person, a trauma -informed approach seeks to learn what happened to them in order to develop a better understanding, sensitivity and caring awareness. Please see the Access to Health Care findings for more information about TIC. Education Challenges Children and youth, especially those who were already struggling, faced additional challenges when pandemic safety measures caused schools to move to virtual learning. Even though most schools had re open ed during the time of HASD&IC's focus groups and inte rviews, youth were still trying to recover from the impact that the pandemic had on their ability to achieve in school. Early in the pandemic, one of the most serious educational inequities was access to reliable Wi -Fi or internet to support distance lea rning. School districts and CBOs made tremendous investment, but disparities remain. In addition, research suggests that Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 118 providing access to Wi -Fi alone was not enough to support successful learning environments at home.142 For many students, c rowded housing conditions made distance or virtual learning extremely difficult. Youth often struggled to concentrate due to distractions at home. In some households, multiple children were attempting to participate in online classes at the same time. In m any cases, older youth supported their younger siblings at the expense of their own education. Housing and Economic Stability for Youth The community shared that vulnerable youth are disproportionately impacted by housing challenges, and the pandemic rap idly intensified those challenges. Vulnerable youth subpopulations include LGBTQ+, former foster youth, justice -involved youth, Black and Latin x youth, pregnant and parenting youth, youth who did not complete high school, and youth who are survivors of hum an trafficking, child sexual exploitation, and domestic violence and abuse. These youth often lack the social networks that can serve as supports when the y experience a sudden change in circumstances. Young people who experience homelessness are at high risk for adverse outcomes such as physical and behavioral health challenges, substance abuse, incarceration, violence and abuse, barriers to education and employment, long -term homelessness, and lower life -expectancy. The San Diego Regional Task Force o n Homelessness' 2022 WeAllCount Point -in-Time Count found that the number of families experiencing homelessness was up 56% from 2020. The count also found that more than 1,800 youth are currently experiencing homelessness county wide.143 Often referred to as an \"invisible\" crisis, youth homelessness impacts 1 in 10 young adults ages 18 to 24 each year, and 1 in 30 adolescents (ages 13 to 17) experience homelessness without a caregiver .144 LGBTQ + youth are twice as likely to become homeless compared to their non-LGBTQ + peers and tend to receive residential treatment at disproportionately high rates. Youth experiencing behavioral health issues, particularly those receiving inpatient and residential behavioral health treatment, face an increase d likelihood of experiencing homelessness. A significant number of homeless youth report foster care involvement via out -of-home placements, either in foster care or institutional settings.145 Safety Concerns Clinicians and CBOs shared concerns about increasing safety risks for children. Many risks were amplified because of the pandemic. 142 San Diego for Every Child (2020), Beyond the Hotspot: Supporting Equitable Distance Learning in San Diego County. 143 San Diego Regional Taskforce on Homelessness (2022), San Diego County WeAllCount Point -in-Time Count. 144 Voices of Youth Count (2017), Missed opportunities: Youth homelessness in America. 145 Manatt Health (2022), Leveraging Medicaid to Reduce Youth Homelessness. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 119 The COVID -19 pandemic led to changes in the types of injuries that were most often experienced by children and youth. With stay -at-home orders, families were contained in their homes and unintentional injuries in the home, like window falls , led to hospitalizations in greater numbers than expected. As families spent more time outside, hospitals experienced an increase in ATV crashes and an unexpec ted increase in drownings \u2014 primarily in backyard pools.146 When schools were teaching through virtual learning, there was a reduction in mandated reporters identifying incidents of domestic violence and neglect. Children who were seen at hospital s seemed to have more serious injuries. In HASD&IC's online community survey, respondents identified bullying (57%) and social media/online gaming (56%) as top concerns. Although the survey doesn't specify whether the bullying was taking place online or in -person, based on community feedback there is growing concern about bullying and harassment through social media. In SDC , neglect comprises an average of 75% of all substantiated child maltreatment allegations for children ages 0 to 5. The combination of limited income and high housing costs are risk factor s for neglect.147 Sexual Exploitation Community members also shared serious concerns about the rapid growth of commercial sex ual exploitation of children (CSEC). Over the past few years, teenagers have spent more time on computers and cellphones than ever before . A 2016 report found that websites were being used to target youth. Since then, the targeting of youth through social media has become much more sophisticated. A study of human trafficking and CSEC in SDC found that the average age of entry into sex trafficking is 16.1 years of age. Among sex trafficking victims included in the study who had been arrested for prostitution, 55% reported that they were homeless and 28% had been in foster care. Twenty high schools were involved in the study, and all participating schools affirmed that recruitment was happening among their students. Further, 90% of participating schools had documented cases of sex trafficking victimiza tion.148 See Appendix M for individual quotes from HASD&IC's community engagement interview and focus group participants regarding the identified community need of Children & Youth Well -Being.

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 120 SMH 2022 CHNA Childcare and Early Education The majority (82%) of IPH Sharp Human Resources Survey respondents expressed that the COVID -19 pandemic had at least a minor impact on access to dependent care (childcare or eldercare). When asked how this need would impact Sharp team members over the next year, 43% believed the issue would remain the same while 21% thought it would get worse. Please see the IPH Sharp Provider/Human Resources 2022 CHNA Survey & Findings in Appendix I for more information on SMH 's 2022 CHNA Children & Youth Well -Being finding s. Chronic Health Conditions Overall Findings Chronic Health Conditions were identified as a high priority need through both the SMH and HASD&IC 2022 CHNAs. Chronic Health Conditions findings are described in terms of specific health conditions (e.g., cancer, cardiovascular disease , diabetes ) as well as relative to the affecte d populations and care challenges listed below. The findings also illustrate how the COVID -19 pandemic has exacerbated these issues . Incidence and mortality Access to care Economic stability , housing and the cost of care Veterans and military LGBTQ+ Other vulnerable populations Stigma Care management and coordination Medication management, cost and coordination Emotional and behavioral health Chronic Health Conditions findings are described below for both the HASD&IC and SMH 2022 CHNAs. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 121 HASD&IC 2022 CHNA Incidence and Mortality In 2019, c hronic health conditions accounted for the majority of SDC's l eading causes of death.57 According to the CDC, chronic diseases \u2014 referred to in this finding as chronic health conditions \u2014 are among the leading causes of death and d isability in the U.S. Six in ten U.S. adults live with a chronic disease and 4 in 10 adults live with at least two chronic diseases.149 From 2000 to 2019, SDC reported an overall decrease in the percentage and rate of deaths due to chronic health condition s.150 Despite this trend, cancer (malignant neoplasms) was San Diegans' leading cause of death in 2019, followed by diseases of the heart. Diabetes was identified as the seventh leading underlying cause of death for San Diegans in that same year.57 For additional data on SDC's leading causes of death, see Section 4: Community Defined . For all cancer sites, the age -adjusted rate in SDC from 2013 to 2017 was 406.9 per 100,000 population . The top 10 incidence151 rates by cancer site are represented in Figure 34.152 Figure 34: Incidence Rates for Cancer in SDC , 2013 -2017152 149 CDC (2022), About Chronic Diseases. 150 San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (2021), Chronic Disease Deaths in San Diego County - County Overview, 2000 -2019. 151 Incidence is the rate of new cases or events over a specified period for the population at risk for the event. In medicine, t he incidence is commonly the newly identified cases of a disease or condition per population at risk over a specified timeframe (National Library of Medicine, 2022). 152 California Cancer Registry (2019), Age-Adjusted Invasive Cancer Incidence Rates in California, 2013 -2017, By County. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 122 The age -adjusted mortality rate for all cancer sites from 2013 to 2017 was 145.9 per 100,000 population . Mortality rates by top 10 cancer sites are represented in Figure 35.153 Figure 35. Mortality Rates for Cancer in SDC , 2013 -17153 *Inflammatory Bowel Disease **non -Hodgkin's lymphoma Access to Care Fear of contracting COVID -19 caused many people to delay or forgo necessary or routine health care . As a result, according to interviewees, preventive care screenings and other health - related assessments were delayed, potentially leading to adverse health outcomes or the progression of an undetected or uncontrolled health condition. This is especially concerning for low -income community members. In 2020, 27.4% of California He alth Interview Survey ( CHIS ) respondents from SDC cited COVID -19 as the main reason for delaying or foregoing needed medical care.54 Research from California Health Care Foundation shows that nearly half ( 47%) of those who postponed care reported their condition worsened as a result (up 6% from a survey administered in th e previous year). When looking at lower -income Californians who postponed care, 51% reported their condition worsening.61 153 California Cancer Registry (2019), Age-Adjusted Cancer Mortality Rates in California, 2 013-2017, By County. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 123 Living with chronic heal th conditions has always been challenging, but the pandemic has made it much more difficult for many community members . In addition, new challenges have emerged. Ongoing unpredictability, social isolation and the inability to get treatment have all had an impact on people with chronic health conditions. Interviewees shared a deep concern about the possibility of an increase in patients who have delayed care and may now be sicker with more complex or complicated conditions. The CDC estimated that due to California's stay -at-home order, screenings at health care facilities may have decreased by 80% from 2019 to 2020 .154 Access to cancer care was identified as a significant challeng e for the community. Delayed or disrupted access to cancer screening and its long -term consequences was identified as a need for community members. More advanced cancers and excess deaths are of particular concern. Interviewees shared that cancer detection at later stages, when treatment may be more intensive and potentially less effective, was a significant concern. A National Cancer Institute prediction model155 estimated that delays in cancer screenings and postponed treatment during the pandemic could result in a dditional breast and colorectal cancer deaths in the U.S. over the next decade .156 One study in SDC found that the incidence of late -stage colorectal and breast cancer s presenting at that institution corresponded to a decrease in early -stage presentation of these cancers.157 Please see the Access to Health Care findings for more information. Economic Stability , Housing and the Cost of Care Insurance conflicts, the cost of insurance premiums and co -pays, and eligibility requirements for appropriate programs were cited as barriers to getting the care needed to manage chronic health conditions. Interviewees shared that community members were often confus ed and did not know what cash assistance programs or services they were eligible for. Cost of care and treatment, along with the looming fear of incurring medical debt , weighs heav ily on cancer patients and survivors. Current and future experiences with medical debt, especially with competing financial stressors, can severely hinder cancer patients and survivors from seeking needed care or limit their treatment options. 154 Miller, M.J., Xu, L., Qin, J., et al.

JAMA Network Open , 5(2), e2148581. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.48581 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 124 A survey of over 3,000 cancer patients and survivors by the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network Survivor Views program found that nearly three -quarters ( 73%) were concerned about their ability to pay current or future costs of care , and 7 in 10 worried about incurring medical debt due to cancer care and treatment . In addition, half of respondents ( 51%) reported incurring medical debt due to costs related to cancer care. Nearly half of respondents ( 45%) with medical debt delayed or avoided medical care for ser ious issues , and 62% reported delay ing or avoid ing medical care for minor issues . Further, about half of respondents described want ing the least expensive treatment options due to their debt. Among the 71% of respondents who made major changes to pay for t heir care, 36% reported cutting back spending on food, clothing and basic household items, while 28% used all of their savings and 20% borrowed money from family or friends.158 In addition, i nterviewees shared that chronic health conditions are especially difficult to manage for those who are unhoused or facing housing hardship. Lack of access to utilities and household appliances , such as refrigerators and stoves , was cited as a challenge to keeping medication stored at the proper temperature an d to cooking nutritious meals that are necessary for diabetes management. For cancer patients and survivors, housing is crucial for recovery and healing from treatments. Please see the Economic Stability findings for more information. Veterans and Military Older adults who have served in the military often present with co -occurring medical, behavioral health and SUDs . These complex cases are the most difficult to treat, which can lead to misdiagnosis, inefficient and ineffective treatment plans and care, worsening health, increased system costs and low patient satisfaction. Fifty -seven percent of older veterans have at least three o r more chronic conditions, compared to 44% of older civilians.159 The overall crude prevalence of having multiple chronic conditions was found to be higher among male and female veterans compared to their counterparts who had not served in the military.160 Veterans are at an elevated risk for cancer due to military service exposure to hazardous chemicals, related materials, and environment al hazard s such as radiation, gas, chemical weapons and herbicides. Presumptive conditions associated with these exposure s include certain cancers, respiratory issues and central nervous system conditions.161 Please see Figures 36 and 37 for 2015 to 2018 data showing the crude percentage of men and women , respectively , with multiple chronic conditions by veteran status and age . 158 American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network (2022), Survivor Views: Cancer & Medical Debt. 159 National Council on Aging (2019), A Profile of Older US Veterans . 160 CDC (2021), Multiple Chronic Conditions Among Veterans and Nonveterans: United States, 2015 -2018 . 161 Veterans Affairs Office of Research & Development (2021), Cancer .

LGBTQ+ persons living with HIV were identified as a group with a disproportionate need for care management support. Peer support and trauma -informed providers were also cited by interviewees as integral for successful disease management . Though new cases of HIV have decreased over the years, the number of individuals living with HIV has increased. In 2018, o ver 13,800 people in SDC were living with HIV . Researchers estimate that another 1,300 SDC residents are living with undiagnosed HIV.162 And, according to 2016 to 2020 CHIS data , the LGB Q163 population in SDC had a higher (29%) asthma rate compared to people who don't identify as LGBQ.164 Please refer to Figure 38 below for additional data on chronic disease prevalence among SDC's LGBQ community.

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 127 Other Vulnerable Populations Several interviewees agreed that people experiencing homelessness and senior community members were most at risk of having an uncontrolled chronic health condition. Interviewees shared that these conditions are often not detected or addressed until they become an emergency. Further, for community members without a home, it is challenging to adhere to a treatment plan such as taking medications on a regular schedule. Across multiple interviews, there was agreement that the most comm on illnesses or injuries for patients experiencing homelessness were untreated, infected or open wounds, and uncontrolled chronic health conditions such as diabetes. The California Department of Health Care Access and Information 2019 hospitalization data showed a significant number of chronic diseases among patients identified as experiencing homelessness \u2014 an average of 6.1 chronic conditions for inpatient discharge s and 2.1 for ED discharge s.5 In 2019, the ED discharge rate for diabetes was 180.6 per 100,000 population for all age groups ; however, the rate was double for those age 65 a nd older (383.5 per 100,000 population ).5 Interviewees also described u ndocumented community members with cancer as being at a severe disadvantage . Many do not have the necessary insurance coverage to enroll in programs and services that could provide financial, logistic al and other supportive needs related to their cancer diagnosis. Please see the Access to Health Care findings for more information. Stigma69 Some community members said they a re reluctant to seek preventive care such as cancer screenings, despite experiencing physical symptoms or a decline in their baseline health. The prospect of receiving a cancer diagnosis made people feel overwhelmed and fearful of potential suffering and death . Immigrants and refugees , whose communities may be smaller and closer -knit, reported being less likel y to seek cancer screening or treatment because they are afraid of being judged by others. Care Management and Coordination Chronic health condition management (i.e., symptom management), preventive screenings, and overall self -management have all been impacted by the pandemic. Some people with chronic health conditions experienced significant disruptions in their care and cri tical support services, potentially undoing progress in their care management journey. In addition, delays in getting the care that could have detected disease early or addressed unmanaged conditions have potentially resulted in more Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 128 acute and complex case s. For example, CDC research shows that, between November 2020 and February 2021, nearly 9 in 10 adults (87%) ages 18 to 29 with diabetes reported delayed receipt of medical care , and 44% reported difficulty accessing diabetes medications .165 Reinforcemen t of self -management skills such as self -care practices (sleep, diet, physical activity) and medication adherence suffered, potentially jeopardizing the capacity of some people to independently manage their health and mitigate illness. Through interview s conducted by community health workers and promotoras, the majority of health conditions (six of the top 10) identified as being the most concerning for community members were associated with chronic health conditions , including : stress (62%) ; high blood pressure (43%) ; diabetes (43%) ; nutrition, physical activity and weight (35%) ; heart disease and stroke (27%) and c ancer (26%) . The closure of various facilities during the pandemic disrupted access to routine and specialty care, making comprehensi ve care even more challenging for people living with chronic health conditions. Even when in -person services resumed, wait times for appointments were long \u2014 sometimes months out. This was especially concerning for patients who require more frequent, timel y and coordinated care. Without regular appointments and with long waits for specialty care, patients with chronic health conditions may have had to ration treatment and support services, i n turn relying on their own ability to stay engaged. According to the CDC's best practices in self-management, increased knowledge, education, support and resources can lead to positive chronic health condition outcomes.166 Due to the intersectionality of findings, please see the Access to Health Care findings for more general information. Medication Management, Cost and Coordination HASD&IC's community engagement participants expressed that financial constraints related to the pandemic made it more difficult to refill and obtain prescriptions . For some patients, medication became a lower priority than other competing financial needs. This made sticking to a treatment plan more difficult. Participants also shared that although those with chronic health conditions understand the importance of engaging in self -management activities such as taking medications on a regular basis, the pandemic made it difficult to stay committed to a routine. This may lead to long-term negative consequences such as advanced disease progression for some people . 165 Czeisler , M., Barrett, C.E., Siegel, K.R., et al.

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 129 Please see the Economic Stability findings for more information. Emotional and Behavioral Health Adherence to treatment p lans is impacted by a variety of factors, including a person's emotional state and behavioral health conditions , such as depression. Anxiety, uncertainty and other stressful experiences during the pandemic , such as coping with job loss, changes in income, or health insurance , may have further exacerbated existing emotional and behavioral health concerns of patients with chronic health conditions. As shown in Figure 39 below, 1 in 10 Californians reported that the stress of the pandemic worsened chronic health conditions .61 Others reported changes in eating patterns, dif ficulty sleeping and increased use of alcohol, tobacco or other substances. Income played a role in the extent to which the pandemic interrupted a person's life.167 Figure 39: Effect s of Worry or Stress Among Californians Related to the COVID -19 Pandemic , 202161 167 U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (2022), Mental Health and Coping during the Coronavirus (COVID -19) Pandemic. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 130 In addition, HASD&IC's community engagement feedback indicated that cancer patients and survivors often worry about being an unnecessary burden to their support systems when there were other competing stressors . See Appendix M for individual quotes from HASD&IC's community engagement interview and focus group participants regarding the identified community need of Chronic Health Conditions.

From FY 2016 to FY 2021, there was a 16% increase in the incidence of acute myocardial infarction, a 35% increase in d iabetes diagnoses and a 15% increase in stroke. Please refer to Figure 40 below for additional detail on the incidence of chronic health conditions at Sharp hospitals. Figure 40: Incidence Rate Trend for Selected Chronic Health Conditions, FY 2016 -FY 2021 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 132 Examining observed to expected mortality (O/E) ratios168 at Sharp hospitals from FY 2016 to FY 2021, there was an increase in deaths due to COPD , diabetes, acute myocardial infarction and hip fracture. There was a slight increase in deaths due to stroke and a slight decrease in deaths due to heart failure. However, further analysis is needed to determine if this variation is statistically significant. See Figure 41 below for additional detail. Figure 41: Mortality O/E Ratio Trend for Selected Chronic Health Conditions, FY 2016 -FY 2021 168 To compare performance across all institutions in terms of mortality, the observed vs expected mortality ratio (O:E) is utilized . The expected mortality is based on the patient's clinical acuity and severity of comorbidities. Therefore, institutions with a hi gher case mix index have a higher expected mortality. However, when the observed mortality is lower than the expected, the ratio becomes less than 1 (Cleveland Clinic, 2022). Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 133 Analysis of Sharp hospital data shows that, a mong COVID -19 patients admitted to the hospital, 62% presented with hypertension, 40% presented with diabetes and 43% presented with obesity. Patients presenting to the E D with COVID - 19 and hypertension were 2.5 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital compared to COVID -19 patients without hypertension. There was a varying risk breakdown by race and ethnicity for hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Patients with diabetes were much more likely to requi re a stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). COVID -19 patients with hypertension and diabetes had higher mortality rates than those without those conditions. Further analysis is required to fully understand these trends. See Figure s 42-45 below for additional information. Figure 42: Comorbid Conditions in Sharp COVID -19 Inpatients , March 2020 -March 2022 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 134 Figure 43: Effect of Comorbidities on COVID -19 Hospital Admission Rate, Sharp Hospitals, March 2020 -March 2022 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 135 Figure 44: Effect of Comorbidities on COVID -19 ICU Utilization, Sharp Hospitals, March 2020 -March 2022 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 136 Figure 45: Effect of Comorbidities on COVID -19 Mortality, Sharp Hospitals, March 2020 -March 2022 Care Management and Coordination The majority (96%) of Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents reported they did not participate in Sharp 's programs designed to connect patients and community members to support services o r resources . Of those who did partic ipate, 63% named \"other\" Sharp programs. This included : diabetes care and education programs (12%) ; nutrition programs (6%) , and weight management programs (6%) . Analysi s of Sharp patient data found that cancer screening volumes dipped significantly during the COVID -19 pandemic. While there was an increase in stage 1 cancer diagnoses, this is a continued trend from previous years and may or may not be related to the reduction in screenings from the previous year. More time and analysis are needed to assess the impact of the pandemic on screening and oncology patient volumes. See Figures 46 and 47 below for additional details . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 137 Figure 46: Impact of COVID -19 Pandemic on Oncology Screening Volumes, FY 2016 -2021 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 138 Figure 47: Impact of COVID -19 Pandemic on New Cancer Diagnoses, FY 2016 -2021 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 139 Please see the following appendices for more information on SMH 's 2022 CHNA Chronic Health Conditions findings: Appendix H : Sharp 2022 Clinical Data Analytics Appendix I : IPH Sharp Provider/Human Resources 2022 CHNA Survey & Findings Appendix J : Sharp Insight Community 2022 CHNA Survey & Findings Community Safety Overall Findings Community Safety was identified as a high priority need through both the SMH and HASD&IC 2022 CHNAs. However, due to the nature of Sharp's community engagement survey questions, opportunities for participant feedback on this topic were limited . Therefore, only findings from the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA process are described in this section . Community Safety findings are most often described in relation to the concerns listed below , including the significant impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on the se issues . Racism Violence and coercion High-risk populations Human trafficking Hospital workforce safety Community Safety findings are described below for the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA. HASD&IC 2022 CHNA Racism In January 2021 , the County of San Diego declared racism a public health crisis. In doing so, the County acknowledg ed that racism underpins health inequities throughout the region and has a substantial correlation to poor outcomes in many facets of life. As the public he alth agency for the region, the County has a responsibility to tackle this issue head on in order to improve the overall health of residents.169 Race was t he most common motivation for hate crimes in both 2020 (76%) and 2021 (64%). In 2020, 6% of the 34 hate crime cases reported in SDC attributed to race involved Asian victims. In 2021, this percentage increased to 18%.170 169 County of San Diego Board of Supervisors (2021), Framework for Our Future: Decl aring Racism a Public Health Crisis . 170 While these numbers are relatively small and should be considered when comparing percentage change, they are consistent with national statistics and other anecdotal feedback from the community regarding increases in t hese types of hate crimes since the pandemic began. SANDAG (2021), Crime in the San Diego Region Mid -Year 2021 Statistics . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 140 Violence and Coercion In HASD&IC 's online community survey , 29% of respondents identified \" being unsafe from violence and coercion at home, work/school, and in my neighborhood\" as a top concern. Community members reported s ignificant levels of fear and feeling unsafe. The COVID -19 pande mic increased stressors that were associated with community violence, such as cases of child abuse, interpersonal violence and domestic abuse.171 Pandemic safety measures, such as virtual schooling, reduced opportunities for government and community agencies to identify and intervene in potential cases of abuse. For instance, there was less mandated reporting while schools were closed. Pandemic saf ety measures further complicated victims' ability to protect themselves from abusers as courts were closed. In some cases , victims were filing restraining orders while continuing to live with the abuse perpetrator . There has been a notable rise in violen ce against marginalized groups. People who are exposed to violence, such as being victims of or witnesses to violen t acts may experience physical decline or adverse mental health effects, including trauma. Over time, trauma can lead to development of anxie ty and depression, or post -traumatic stress disorder.172, 173 In addition , feeling unsafe in one's own neighborhood due to increased or persistent law enforcement presence caused community members to worry about being surveilled . This impacted individuals' ability to trust their environment and maintain their health. Interviewees discussed the importance of having a safe environment in which to live, exercise, or play. The combination of feeling unsafe yet being watched may cause individuals to develop feelings of mistrust toward authority, which can lead to withdrawal and a reluctance to seek care or assistance. High-Risk Populations Community members frequently shared concerns related to living in unsafe neighborhoods and described their dai ly precautions (such as always carrying pepper spray). They mentioned the impact on people of all ages, but there were particular concerns about children and their access to safe outdoor spaces. Safety concerns were not limited to concerns regarding physic al harm \u2014 the community also cited concerns about exposure to racism and bullying. Interviewees identified some populations as higher risk for experiencing violence or abuse and disproportionately suffering from significant health inequities as a result . This included : People with a history of involvement in the foster care and child welfare systems Justice -involved y outh and adults Seniors who are vulnerable or caregiver -dependent People from marginalized rac ial/ethnic groups, such as those who are BIPOC LGBTQ+ community members, especially trans gender Black women 171 Cannon, C.

Expanding the original definition of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). Journal of Child and Adolescent Trauma , 12(3), 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 141 In California, Adult Protective Services receives more than 15,000 reports of elder and dependent adult abuse per month, and reports are increasing. T here are over 200,000 cases of elder and dependent adult abuse reported each year in California. Elder abuse is significantly underreported \u2014 for every case known to programs and agencies, an estimated 24 are unknown. For financial abuse, just 1 in 44 case s is known.174 In addition, t ransgender people are more likely than cisgender people to be victims of hate crimes and intimate partner violence , regardless of sex assigned at birth. Half of transgender adults report a t least one lifetime incident of physical or sexual assault. Compared to other groups, Black transgender women are more likely than other groups to be polyvictimized \u2014 subjected to multiple forms of violence, sometimes at the same time, over the course of their lifetime due to the intersectionality of race, gender and socioeconomic status.175 A frequent theme in conversations was the safety concerns of people experiencing homelessness. Community members who are homeless are more likely to be involved in violent acts and sustain injuries as a result of assaults. Furthermore, they are frequently targeted for theft of their belongings, such as identification documents, medications or mobility aids like wheelchairs, walkers or canes. This may lead individuals to develop an overwhelming sense of fear, a constant sense of being unsafe, and a feeling of deep mistrust of their surroundings. Such experiences can cause re -traumatization. According to County data , individuals experiencing homelessness have higher rate s of victimization in the following categories when compared to the general population: murder (19 times higher) , attempted murder (27 times) , robbery (15 times) , domestic violence (15 times) , aggravated assault (12 times) , elder abuse (10 times) and sexua l assault (9 times).176 Human Trafficking Human trafficking is a public health issue that intersects with all social determinants of health. Some community members are at a higher risk of being a victim of labor or sex trafficking due to age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity/race, sexual orientatio n or gender identity. Misinformation, especially during the pandemic, made identifying and assisting survivors and potential victims extremely difficult. Another challenge is sensationalism of images, assumptions, and stories shared publicly or in the medi a. While SDC is located along an international border, the most recent study from the University of San Diego found that 79.3% of people trafficked for sex are U.S. citizens.177 The San Diego Human Trafficking Task Force did note that the border plays a r ole in labor trafficking. 174 California Assoc iation of Area Agencies of Aging (2019), Elder and Dependent Adult Abuse Awareness . 175 Sherman, A.

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 142 At some point in their lives, more than 90% of people with developmental disabilities will experience sexual abuse , and nearly half (49%) will experience 10 or more instances of abuse. Other experts have estimated that the percentage is closer to 95%.178,179 In many cases, traffickers identify and exploit the vulnerabilities or unmet needs (emotional, financial, physical, etc .) of their victims to induce dependence. The following community members were identified by interviewees as particularly at risk: People living with a developmental disability People with children People from marginalized rac ial/ethnic groups, such as BIPOC Foster youth LGBTQ+ populations Undocumented individuals People experiencing food, economic or housing insecurity Interviewees identified major gaps in critical services for survivors of human trafficking. Needed services include: more shelter beds, especially for male or LGBTQ+ survivors ; more trauma -informed shelter or short -term housing options , such as low barrier options that do not require sobriety ; a 24/7 hotline for safe shelter collaborative program s, staffed by trained ment al health professionals; and text-message accessible hotline s or web -based intake services that are easily hidden from exploiters . Advocates reported that survivors are frequently misidentified as being difficult or non - compliant in clinical settings beca use of their inability to follow their care plan. However, this \"non-compliance\" may often be the result of trauma responses. To help prevent patient harm and moral injury to staff, bedside clinicians should administer assessments as part of multidiscipl inary protocols . TIC is ideal for assisting patients in requesting assistance or ensuring that they feel safe returning to health care facilities if they choose to decline assistance. If patients are not ready for support or do not trust the system or authorities, a premature hand -off to social work can stigmatize them.180, 181, 182 Hospital Workforce Safety San Diego hospitals and health systems have histor ically been hotspots for violent encounters. However, workplace violence has worsened during the pandemic and was identified as an alarming concern. Increased stressors and political tensions (e.g., mask mandate s) due to the pandemic may have caused an uptick in ag gression and violence towards health care workers. Types of violence that health care workers may encounter include: nonphysical or psychological harm , 178 U.S. DOJ Office of Justice Programs (1995), The sexual abuse interview for those with developmental disabilities. 179 The Journal of Adult Protection (2020), People with an intellectual disability: under -reporting sexual violence. 180 National Human Trafficking Training and Technical Assistance Center (2021), Core competencies for human trafficking response in health care and behavioral health systems. 181 Stoklosa, H., & Ash, C.

Violence against health care workers makes it difficult for providers and other health care staff to provide quality care. Additionally, witnessing violence in health care settings creates a stressful environment for other patients seeking care. Having a safe, comfortable and supportive working environment contributes to overall mental, physical and emotional well -being. Unfortunately, workplace violence also deeply impacts health care workers emotionally and p sychologically. After witnessing or assisting a colleague after a violent encounter with a patient, health care workers are profoundly affected by vicarious trauma.93 Such experiences could lead to staff burnout, compassion fatigue and secondary traumatic stress. Please see the Access to Health Care findings for more information. The health care industry experiences the highest rate of injuries caused by workplace violence and employees are five times as likely to suffer a n injury from workplace violence compared to the overall work force .183 Since the onset of the pandemic, violence against hospital employees has markedly increased \u2014 and there is no sign it is receding. Studies indicate that 44% of U.S. nurses report ed experiencing physical violence and 68% report ed verbal abuse during the pandemic.184 See Appendix M for individual quotes from HASD&IC's community engagement interview and focus group participants regarding the identified community need of Community Safety. In addition, the complete results of HASD&IC's online community engagement survey are available within the full HASD&IC 2022 Economic S tability Overall Findings Economic Stability was identified as a high priority need in both the SMH and HASD&IC 2022 CHNAs. Economic Stability findings primarily highlight the concerns listed below , including the profound impact of the COVID -19 pandemic on community members' ability to thrive economically. Economic self-sufficiency in SDC COVID -19 economic hardship Safety net/support programs Housing concerns Food insecurity 183 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2020), Workplace Violence in Healthcare, 2018. 184 Byon, H.D., Sagherian , K., Kim, Y., & Steege , L. (2021). Nurses' experience with Type II workplace violence and underreporting during the COVID -19 pandemic. Workplace Health and Safety , 1-9. doi: 10.1177/21650799211031233 Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 144 Childcare Fear of health care costs Economic Stability findings are described below for both the HASD&IC and SMH in SDC The profound impact that economic stability has on a person's health and well -being was a universal concern and topic of discussion among all interviews and focus groups. Many people were overwhelmingly stressed and worrie d about not having enough money to pay for essential necessities. At the same time, HASD&IC heard from community organizations that have seen a significant increase in the number of people seeking assistance. When a person loses their job , has unstable i ncome or lives in poverty, they may struggle to afford essential necessities including food, utilities, housing, childcare and health care. Alternatively, households or individuals with steady employment may still not earn enough (low-wage earnings) to mee t their health needs.185 Economic instability has a domino effect , and people often experienc e multiple challenges at once \u2014 for instance housing instability, food insecurity and a lack of reliable transportation. The high cost of living in SDC , coupled w ith the pressure of inflation has resulted in many people expressing difficulty affording and accessing services that meet their health and social needs. Economic instability places a burden on people by forcing them to make difficult decisions. For instan ce, does one spend money on rent or pay for a life-saving medication, or pay for groceries instead of the utility bill? Having to make these trade -offs can have a dire impact on the overall health and well -being of the community . Figures 48 and 49 below contain key findings from the County of San Diego's Self -Sufficiency Standard Dashboard (an economic stability measure that considers essential household expenses), to provide a more accurate picture of the income needed to live comfortably in SDC .186 185 HP 2030 (2022), Economic Stability . 186 County of San Diego HHSA (2022); San Diego County Self-Sufficiency Standard Brief, Single -Adult Household, 2021.

Families of affected workers also face d the consequences of lost jobs or wages , causing a ripple effect on their ability to access essential needs. The immediate impact of COVID -19 on SDC's r egional economy included:187 As of March 28, 2020, e stimated unem ployment among SDC residents was approximately 20 times the pre -pandemic rate. The unemployment rate in the region remain ed high, and at the end of May 2020, was estimated to be at 28.5%. As of June 7, 2020, more than two -thirds of Black (67%) and Hispanic (70%) SDC residents lived in ZIP codes with higher -than-average unemployment rates. In interviews conducted with refugees in 2021, 86% of participants shared that financial concerns were their biggest source of emotional distress.188 Safety -Net/Support Programs Over 1.35 million San Diegans \u2014 more than 1 in 3 SDC residents \u2014 are enrolled in safety -net programs such as Medi -Cal, CalFresh and CalWORKs.189 COVID -19 heightened the importance of and need for safety -net programs during an economic crisis. Interviewees shared that there was an increase in outreach from community organizations during the pandemic, encouraging them to enroll in programs designed to help them access and afford food and health care. In January 2022 , the average monthly income of CalFresh recipients in SDC was $997 , while the average monthly income for Medi -Cal enrollees was $1,082.190 In addition, community organizations and commu nity members expressed the \"deep fear\" the undocumented community had in having their immigration status revealed. Although many immigrant families qualified for safety -net programs and other resources that became available during the pandemic, community members shared that fear prevented people from seeking help. Multiple interviewees stated that the previous presidential administration's public charge85 rule caused immigrants and their family members (including U.S. -born children) to disenroll or avoid enrollment in public benefit programs. Nearly half (46%) of families who needed assistance during the pandemic did not apply for it due to concern s over immigration status.191 187 SANDAG (2020), COVID -19 Impact on the San Diego Region: Black and Hispanic Communities Hardest Hit. 188 University of California San DIego Center for Community Health -Refugee Health Unit (2021), 2021 COVID -19 Refugee Health Impact Assessment. 189 County of San Diego HHSA (2022), Eligibility of Services by the Numbers. 190 County of San Diego Office of Business Intelligence (2022), CalFresh and Medi -Cal Dashboards . 191 No Kid Hungry (2021), Public Charge was Reversed \u2014 But Not Enough Immigrant Families Know . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 147 Housing Affordable housing has become unattainable for many San Diegans and was identified as a top need by community engagement participants . With the soaring cost of housing, community members consistently described difficulty paying rent or finding an affordable place to live. Community members stressed that paying to maintain their housing was their top priority and left little money for ot her costs. Community members shared that rent increases create an even bigger challenge for people who are already living month -to-month. Some community members said they experienced rent increases twice in one year and faced the risk of being evicted fr om their homes . Others said they have had to move in with others to offset housing expenses. Unaffordable rent can eventually push people into homelessness. In addition, certain populations are at increased r isk of housing instability. Interviewees share d that strict requirements , such as established rental history and income that is at least double the amount of rent , create additional challenges for certain community members and increase the risk of housing instability. Individuals on fixed incomes, like seniors and people with disabilities, were identified as struggling to pay housing costs. Young people without an extensive rental history struggle to get approved for housing even with assistance from organizations. Refugee communities also face significant challenges in managing housing costs. A recent assessment of refugee health concerns during COVID -19 found that the pandemic made it harder for 75% of those interviewed to cover housing costs. Although 83% of the ho useholds included in the assessment received Section 8 housing vouchers, they still reported spending more than 30% of their income on housing.188 Without sufficient or stable income, finding affordable housing is difficult. Community organizations shared that undocumented workers in particular have a hard time finding employment because some of them do not have a visa (work permit). In California, n early 38% of undocumented workers and more than 61% of children living with undocumented workers live in households earning less than a living wage and face chronic and severe housing instability.192 Focus group participants and key informants said that pe ople who are hous ing insecure are also at high risk for human trafficking \u2014 especially labor trafficking , which involves working in high-risk, dangerous conditions in exchange for housing or income to pay for housing costs. Community organizations shared that, during the pandemic, there was an increase in calls pleading for cash assistance to pay for rent, mortgage and utilities. Despite eviction moratoriums, many households still found themselves at risk for eviction and some received eviction notices. Concern over losing their home caused turmoil, fear and anxiety. Rental assistance programs were available and provided relief to some families ; however, not everyone qualified for assistance or received it in a timely fashion . Community engagement 192 University of California Merced Community and Labor Center (2022), Essential Fairness: The Case for Unemployment Benefits for California's Undocumented Immigrant Workers. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 148 particip ants shared that it was particularly stressful trying to assist undocumented residents because there were no housing resources available. The community shared that although housing assistance exists for low -income residents , these resources fall short. P eople who are eligible for housing programs such as Section 8 and public housing encounter long waits due to high demand throughout SDC . Interviewees shared that being on the waitlist causes stress, anxiety and hopelessness as they try to advocate for them selves and support their families. According to 2-1-1 San Diego , the top client needs were housing (23%), utilities (14%), and income support and employment (12%). Of the clients assessed for housing , 54% had an immediate need; 21% needed housing in less t han a month; and 28% were identified as homeless (sheltered, unsheltered or unspecified homeless).193 In 2020, people on the Section 8 waitlist who were selected to receive a housing voucher had waited an average of 12 years before being chosen .194 In addition, a dequate housing conditions and safety were identified throughout the interviews as being a high need for community members. Some of the concerns about housing quality raised by interv iewees included contaminants, pests and lack of accessibility for those who are aging, those with disabilities or those with a health condition. Living in poor housing conditions can lead to an increased exposure to mold and allergens that can result in negative health outcomes over time. Additionally, housing that lacks reliable heating or cooling mechanisms has been found to put some people, such as seniors, at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease or death .195 Food Insecurity Food insecurity was identified as a persistent issue in the community. Economic instability and competing priorities were commonly mentioned as impact ing a household's access to food. Households forced to choose between competing priorities due to limited resources are often left without enough money for food. Financial strain, especially during the pandemic, caused an alarming number of people to experience food insecurity \u2014 many for the first time. In 2021, 83% of 2 -1-1 San Diego clients said they stru ggled to meet other basic needs before they could pay for nutrition al needs. About 43% of clients reported \"sometimes\" running out of food and 29% of clients reported running out of food during the previous month.193 Barriers to accessing food were identified. The se included not having enough money to purchase food, lack of reliable transportation to buy groceries or get to a local food bank (especially among people with physical limitations), and fear of applying or seeking help. Some community members also expresse d the need for food pantries to extend their normal business hours. Food insecurity is linked to negative health outcomes including poor nutrition and disease management.196 Food insecure children are more likely to have poor school performance, higher le vels of behavioral and emotional problems such as anxiety and depression, asthma , 193 2-1-1 San Diego (2021), Community Information Exchange All Clients Profile Report 2021. 194 County of San Diego HHSA (2021), Public Housing Agency Plans. 195 Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (2011), How Does Housin g Affect Health? 196 Food Research and Action Center (2017), The Impact of Poverty, Food Insecurity, and Poor Nutrition on Health and Well -Being. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 149 iron-deficiency anemia and increased ED visits.196,197 Food insecure adults are likely to have chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or coronary heart diseas e,198 while older adults are likely to have limitations in activities of daily living ,199 lower cognitive function, and CHF.200 For additional information on food and nutrition insecurity in SDC, see Section 4: Community Defined . Childcare In California, the annual cost of infant care is $16,945 .201 Like housing, childcare costs were referred to as consuming a significant portion of a household's budget and causing financial hardship among parents, especially single parents. The average price of childcare for two young children in the San Diego region consumes 40% of the budget for a typical family of four .202 Childcare providers shared that childcare is expensive \u2014 especially infant and toddler care \u2014 because there are far fewer providers available than prior to the pandemic . Interviewees shared that without access to affordable childcare , some parents lean on family members or relatives to care for their children. Other working parents are forced to decide whether to leave their job to care for their children at home. According to research by the S an Diego Workforce Partnership , the childcare crisis hits middle income working families hardest. Figure 50 below illustrate s the \"chasm\" families fall into if they do not have enough income to afford childcare and don't qualify for childcare subsidies .203 Figure 50: San Diego's Childcare Affordability Chasm203 197 Margaret M.C., Thomas, Miller, D.P., & Morrissey, T.W.

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 150 Childcare subsidies are available for low -to-moderate -income families, but interviewees expressed that there are long waitlists for financial assistance. In addition, some middle - income wo rking families are stuck between not qualifying for financial assistance and not being able to afford the expenses out-of-pocket . Community leaders shared that due to the pandemic and increased need for childcare assistance, the waitlist was severely impac ted. Interviewees shared that parents were under financial stress and desperate to find affordable childcare . Although emergency subsidies provided financial relief for some families, childcare slots were hard to find due to business closures. Fear of Health Care Costs A common theme raised during all interviews and focus groups was the fear of health care costs. Even people with existing health insurance shared that the out -of-pocket costs are expensive and unaffordable, especially among low -income co mmunit ies. Concerns about not being able to afford copayments or medical bills often cause people to delay the care necessary to maintain their health or a chronic condition, take less medication than prescribed to extend their supply (particularly among s eniors), and in some cases, avoid going to the ED in an event of an emergency.

More than 90% of respondents report ed that COVID -19 had either or a moderate or major impact on patien ts' financial security and 96% reported it had either a moderate or major impact on patients' employment stability. Patients noted to be especially impacted by COVID -19 in relation to increased financial insecurity included patients who use Medi -Cal; refugee or newly immigrated patients; individuals with LEP; caregivers of adults or older adults ; Hispanic patients; and Black/African American patients . In addition, the majority (88%) of IPH Sharp Human Resources Survey participants noted that COVID -19 had at least a minor impact on Sharp team members' financial security . Further, 43% of Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents reported experiencing at least a minor increase i n financial uncertainty due to COVID -19. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 151 Safety -Net/Support Programs Approximately 90 % of IPH Sharp Provider Survey respondents reported that COVID -19 had either a moderate or major impact on patients' access to community resources (e.g., housing, financial assistance, in -home support) and 83% reported that COVID -19 had a moderate or major impact on access to transportation. In addition, the majority (78%) of IPH Sharp Human Resources Survey participants noted that COVID -19 had at least a minor impact on Sharp team members' access to community resources . Most IPH Sharp Provider Survey respondents (70%) indicated that Sharp has not implemented programs to address increased financial insecurity. Exam ples given about how Sharp has addressed increased financial insecurity included: financial assistance, including pharmaceuti cal assistance and grocery gift cards; community resources, including referrals to CalFresh and local food pantries as well as Lyft rides to appointments; and clinical programs, such as telehealth and case management outreach. Among Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents , 15% reported that COVID -19 had at least minorly decreased their access to transportation , and 13% reported it had at least minorly decreased their access to community resources (e.g., housing, utilities, financial support) . The majority (96%) of Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents reported that they did not participate in Sharp's pro grams designed to connect patients and community members to support services or resources. Of those who did participate, 26% utilized Sharp's referrals to 2 - 1-1 San Diego , 11% utilized Sharp's referrals to 2-1-1 San Diego's Community Information Exchange, 11% utilized Sharp's patient transportation services , and 22% utilized other Sharp community resource referrals for concerns such as food, housing and transportation . Housing Concerns Among Sharp Insight Community Survey respondents , 12% reported COVID -19 had at least minorly increased their housing instability/homelessness. Food Insecurity Nearly all (98%) IPH Sharp Provider Survey respondents reported that COVID -19 had at least a minor impact on patients' food security , and t he majority (75%) of IPH Sharp Human Resources Survey participants noted that COVID -19 had at least a minor impact on Sharp team members' food security. Further, 20% of Sharp Insight Community Survey par ticipants indicated that COVID -19 had at least minorly decreased their access to healthy food. Childcare The majority (82%) of IPH Sharp Human Resources Survey respondents expressed that COVID -19 had at least a minor impact on access to dependent care ( childcare or eldercare).

Findings for this need are described by the following data trends and health concerns: Fertility trends Maternal and infant health indicators Infant mortality High-risk pregnancy Behavioral health Fertility Trends According to the CDC, following seven straight years of decline, the number of births in the U.S. increased 1% (to 3.66 million) from 2020 to 2021. This trend was driven by increases in births among White and Hispanic mothers, while all other racial/ethnic groups continued to experience a decline. The 2021 national general fertility rate and total fertility rate are both up 1% from 2020 \u2014 the first increase since 2014.204 The teenage birth rate reached a record low in 2021, dropping to 14.4 births per 1,000 females ages 15 to 19. The teen birth rate has declined 77% since its most recent peak in 1991. While the birth rate of women in the ir early 20s continued to decline, birth rates rose for women in their late 20s, 30s and 40s.204 In 2019, there were 38,445 live births in SDC overall. The 2019 infant mortality rate was 2.5 infant deaths per 1,000 live births in the north coastal region, 2.8 in the east region, 3.3 in the central region, 3.7 in SDC overall, 4.0 in the north central region, 4.4 in the north inland region, and 4.6 in the south region.205 Maternal and Infant Health Indicators Maternal health refers to the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period.206 Early and regular prenatal care helps many women have healthy pregnancies and 204 CDC National Center for Health Statistics (2022), Births: Provisional Data for 2021. 205 County of San Diego HHSA, PHS, CHSU (2021), Maternal and Child Health Outcomes Workbook, 2019. 206 World Health Organization (2022), Maternal Health .

Among babies born preterm, 36.0% were identified as Hispanic or Latino, and 5 5.0% were male.15 Sharp provides a variety of educational opportunities designed to support employees' personal and professional development. When asked to choose among educational topics they would be most interested in learning abou t, 20% of employees who participated in the IPH Sharp Provider Survey and 27% of employees who participated in the IPH Sharp Human Resources Survey expressed interest in education al opportunities about maternal and infant health with a focus on the Black c ommunity. Infant Mortality In 2019, 141 infants in SDC died before their first birthday. Infant mortality was more common among male infants (76 deaths) than female infants (65 deaths). Infants of other 207 U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Office on Women's Health (2021), Prenatal Care. 208 Early prenatal care is defined as care initiated during the first trimester of pregnancy, not accounting for frequency of car e. 209 VLBW refers to birth weight less than 1,500 grams (approximately 3 pounds, 5 ounces). 210 HP 2030 health indic ators are not available for VLBW or LBW infants . 211 LBW refers to birth weight less than 2,500 grams (approximately 5 pounds, 8 ounces). 212 Infant mortality refers to the number of deaths of infants under one year of age per 1,000 live births. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 154 races/ethnicities had the highest mortality rate (14.8 infant deaths per 1,000 l ive births) when compared to infants of all other races and ethnicities. Black infants had the second highest mortality rate of 13.9 deaths per 1,000 live births.205 In addition, 3,336 preterm births occurred in SDC during 2019.205,213 Compared to all other races and ethnicities, Hispanic mothers had the highest total number of births (14,340) , of which 8.4% were preterm. Although Black mothers and American Indian/Alaska Native mothers had fewer total births (1,515 and 129 total births, respectively ), they experienced the highest rates of preterm births among all other racial or ethnic groups (10.7% and 12.4% of preterm births, respectively). Similarly, although women ages 25 to 39 had the highest total number of births among all age groups, mothers age 40 and older were more likely to give birth preterm (13.9% preterm births among mothers age 40 and older compared to 8.5% among mothers ages 25 to 39).205 High-Risk Pregnancy A high -risk pregnancy is one that carries increased health risks for the pregnant person, the fetus, or both.214 High-risk pregnancy may result from a medical condition present before pregnancy or a medical condition that develops during pregnancy for either mom or baby and causes the pregnancy to become high risk. A high -risk pregnancy can pose problems before, during or after delivery and may require special monitoring throughout the pregnancy.215 Risk factors for high -risk pregnancy include: advanced maternal age \u2014 there is an increased risk for mothers age 35 years and older; lifestyle choices such as smoking, alcohol consumption or the use of illegal drugs; medical history including prior high -risk pregnancies or deliveries, fetal genetic conditions or family history of genetic conditions; underlying conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and epilepsy; and multiple pregnancies.215 An analysis of SMBHWN discharge data found the following:15 Among women admitted to SMBHWN in 2020 for supervision of a high -risk pregnancy, 80.0% were between the ages of 35 and 64. In 2020, women identified as Asian or Pacific Islander represented 14.9% of all female inpatient discharges at SMBHWN, but 25.0% of i npatient discharges with a gestational diabetes diagnosis. Among women enrolled in Medi -Cal who gave birth at SMBHWN in 2020, 60.3% presented with a complication during childbirth. Within this group, the most common complications were obesity (31.6%), abno rmalities in fetal heart rate and rhythm (28.2%), and anemia (23.1%). Behavioral Health Participants in the IPH Sharp Provider Survey identified increased anxiety and depression , as well as limited access to behavioral health care, as being among the needs most seriously impacted by the COVID -19 pandemic in the past year . Participants had the opportunity to choose among specific populations that have been mos t impacted by these issues .

Sharp Health Care (Sharp) Community Health Needs Assessment (C HNA ) Community Guide As part of its 2019 CHNA Phase 2 process, Sharp updated the Sharp CHNA Community Guide. The guide is available to the public on sharp.com and provides a user -friendly document describing Sharp's CHNA process and findings, as well as strat egies employed by Sharp to address identified health and social needs. In addition, the Sharp CHNA Community Guide provides a direct link for community members to provide feedback on Sharp's CHNA process. Please refer to Appendix G for the 2019 Sharp CHNA Community Guide. In early - to mid-2023, an updated Sharp CHNA Community Guide will be available https://www.sharp.com/about/community/community -benefits/health -needs -assessments.cfm . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 159 Section 7 Recommendations & Next Steps The findings of this C ommunity Health Needs Assessment (C HNA ) revealed significant priority health needs impacting communities served by Sharp Memorial Hospital (SMH ) and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns (SMBHWN ), particularly those facing inequities. In addition, the findings provided insight and reco mmendations from patients and community members and the Sharp Health Care (Sharp) team members who serve them . This insight will assist SMH and SMBHWN in the design and implementation of programs and services to help improve community health and well -being. Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment (HASD&IC 2022 CHNA) : Community Recommendations HASD&IC 2022 CHNA community engagement participants were asked , \"What are the most important things that hospitals and health systems could do to improve health and well -being in our community?\" Overwhelmingly, respondents expressed a critical need to help patients connect to and navigate available services that will help improve their health and well -being. In both the interviews and surveys, options that centered around improved patient care rose to the top. Most responses fell into four categories: navigation and support, cultur ally appropriate care, workforce development, and community collaboration. See Table 26 for the types of recommendations identified by HASD&IC's community engagement participants. For the complete results of HASD&IC's online community engagement survey , see Community Recommendations for Hospitals and Health Systems to Improve Community Health and Well -being HASD&IC 2022 CHNA COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS Provide Navigation & Support to Patients Connect patients to services that will improve their health & well -being Help patients understand and use health coverage Help patients coordinate their health services Help patients apply for health coverage or other benefits Help patients pay for their health care bills Provide Culturally Appropriate Care to Patients Ensure that a patient's care meets their needs Provide culturally appropriate health care in more languages Train hospital staff on biases Workforce Development Diversify the health care workforce Hire more doctors, nurses, and other health care professionals Create more health care job opportunities and career pathways Community Collaboration Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 160 Collaborate with community groups and schools Provide health education Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Co mmunity Health Needs Assessment ( Community Recommendations The SMH 2022 CHNA community engagement process collect ed input through a series of surveys with a special focus on the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic . Specifically, t his included the pandemic's impact on: the needs previously identified in the 2019 CHNA ; the use of Sharp 's programs and services designed to address t hose needs ; participation in telehealth ; and engage ment in Sharp 's employee education al opportunities. Through these s urvey s, participants provided valuable feedback and suggestions to help SMH and SMBHWN address the community's top health and social needs. Institute for Public Health at San Diego State University (IPH) Sharp Provider and Human Resources Surveys In partnership with the IPH, two surveys were distributed to Sharp team members ; the IPH Sharp Provider Survey assessed impacts on Sharp patients and the IPH Sharp Human Resources Survey assessed impact s on Sharp employees. A total of 108 employees represe nting different Sharp entities and occupations completed the two surveys. IPH Sharp Provider Survey results made it clear that the COVID -19 pandemic has had serious effects on Sharp's patients including: the isolation of seniors ; mental health ; access to health care; fear of utilizing health care; economic and food security; and access to social and emotional support and community resources . Most respondents believed Sharp does not have programs or services to address these issues. Recommendations include d providing more follow -up calls with patients, home visits, caregiver support, and enabling safe visitation even during COVID -19. Respondents also suggested raising awareness about existing resources and expanding resources that are already in place. When asked about teleheal th, most survey participants indicated that virtual video visits were not easy for patients due to challenges with accessing and using technology . Although m ost agreed that many patients prefer in -patient visits for a better connection with provider s and confidence in their care , 95% of respondents still agreed that many telehealth modalities are potentially beneficial to patients . IPH Sharp Human Resources Survey results revealed that COVID -19 was negatively impacting Sharp employees, most notably their levels of anxiety, stress, depression and frustration. Fortunately, most respondents believed Sharp has implemented programs to address these concerns. In addition, respondents indicated that employees are more likely to wish to change careers or leave the workforce and that they are more isolated . Most respondents believed Sharp does not have programs in place to alleviate these issues. Respondents emphasized the importance of addressing employee well -being and reducing turnov er. Their recommendations centered around improving communication, work -life balance, compensation, new graduate programs and the hiring process. Most critically, both surveys indicated that the community is facing a behavioral health crisis. And while th e behavioral health of patients and employees is worsening, the availability of Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 161 behavioral health providers has decreased and access to timely behavioral health care services has become even more difficult. Respondents emphasized that efforts must be made to increase the availability of behavioral health care providers and to ensure easy access to them for both patients and employees. Also emphasized was the creation of more community - based programs as well as the importance of offering behavioral health se rvices in patients' primary languages. Further, of the more than half of respondents from both surveys who participated in Sharp's employee educational opportunities, most felt these programs better prepared them to meet patient needs, relate to patients and fellow team members, and protect their own mental health and well -being. The topics of greatest interest for future educational sessions included: care in the senior community; defining and applying cultural humility; and implicit/unconscious bias and its impact on decision making. Overall, the results of the two surveys indicate that the negative impact of the COVID -19 pandemic has been significant on both patients and employees. Findings suggest that increased support and human connection in health care \u2014 both for patients and staff \u2014 is essential to address the most acute needs experienced by Sharp's community. These findings will help guide Sharp's (including SMH and SMBHWN ) internal discussions and program planning to address these complex issues with engagement, care and empathy. Please see the IPH Sharp Provider /Human Resources 2022 CHNA Survey & Findings in Appendix I for a complete discussion of these findings and recommendations . Sharp Insight Community Survey The Sharp Insight Community Survey was distributed to 3,156 Sharp Insight Community members including Sharp patients and their families, community residents , Sharp employees, and Sharp -affiliated physicians. A total of 619 recipients completed the survey. Although t he majority of respondents did not participate in Sharp programs designed to connect patients and community members to support services or community resources t hat might help address the identified community needs , those who did reported them as effective ly connecting them to the programs or services they were looking for. Due to the low number of participants reporting interaction with support services or community resources , recommendations for Sharp programs were limited . In addition, although the majority of survey participants indicated that the pandemic had a limited impact on their access to care , most still emphasized the convenience of tele health in accessing care during the pandemic. This data suggests that the pandemic impacted different demographic groups in different ways, further demonstrating health inequities faced in our region. The feedback also suggests that more can be done to promote community awareness about Sharp programs and servi ces among certain populations within S an Diego County (SD C). Please see the Sharp Insight Community 2022 CHNA Survey & Findings in Appendix J for additional feedback from this community engagement group . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 162 HASD&IC 2022 CHNA: Hospital Next Steps Hospitals and health systems that participated in the HASD&IC 2022 CHNA process have varying requirements for next steps. Private, not -for-profit (tax -exempt) hospitals and health systems are required to develop hospital or health system community health needs assessment reports and implementation strategies to address selected identified health needs. The participating health districts and district heal th systems do not have the same CHNA requirements but work very closely with their patient communities to address health needs by providing programs, resources and opportunities for collaboration with partners. Every participating hospital and health care system will review the CHNA data and findings in accordance with their own patient communities and principal functions and evaluate opportunities for next steps to address the top identified health needs in their respective patient communities. The CHNA report will be made available as a resource to the broader community and is intended to serve as a useful resource to both residents and health care providers to further communitywide health improvement efforts. HASD&IC and the CHNA Committee are proud of their collaborative relationships with local community organizations and are committed to regularly seeking input from the community to inform community health strategies. The CHNA Committee is in the process of planning Phase 2 of the 2022 CHNA, which wi ll include gathering community feedback on the 2022 CHNA process and strengthening partnerships around identified community needs. The CHNA Committee has already identified a few priority areas for future research: Updated hospital discharge data : This report generally cites hospital discharge data covering the years 2017 -2019. Due to the COVID -19 pandemic and its potential to create temporary anomalies, 2020 hospital discharge data was not used. The CHNA Committee plan s to seek expert assistance and p rovide the community with updated hospital discharge reports with data from 2020 and 2021. Substance use: The 2022 community engagement process revealed concerns around increasing substance use for both children and adults but is not sufficiently docume nted in the most recent trends. Additional information will be collected from community partners. The impact of future/pending changes to programs critical to the health and well -being of our community : Within weeks or months after this report is drafte d, there could be significant changes to housing eviction protections, Covered California premium subsidies, Medi -Cal requirements to maintain coverage, CalFresh benefits, free school lunches and other programs and supports that communities relied on durin g the pandemic. The CHNA Committee plan s to check in with community partners about the impact of these issues as part of the 2022 CHNA Phase 2 community engagement process . Increasing costs and inflation : Within the last few weeks of the community engagement process, there was increasing concern surrounding the issue of inflation and the rising Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 163 cost of essential items. Community organizations and food banks were reporting increasing need and struggling with the increased costs to meet the need. High gas prices were preventing community members from accessing needed services , such as health care appointments and food distributions. The CHNA Committee plan s to check in with community partners about the impact of these issues as part of the 2022 CHNA Phase 2 community engagement process . SMH 2022 CHNA: Next Steps SMH -2026 ( FY 2023 - FY 2026 ) Implementation Strategy to address the needs identified through the 2022 CH NA process for the primary communities they serve. The SMH 2022 CHNA Planning Team, in addition to Sharp leadership, Sharp Community Benefit, service line leaders and other team members are committed to an ongoing exploration of partnerships and collaborations that will help address the needs of SMH and SMBHWN 's community members. The SMH FY 2023 http://www.sharp.com/about/community/health -needs -assessments.cfm . In addition, the implementation strategy is submitted along with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 990, Schedule H. The IRS Form 990, Schedule H will also be publicly available on Gui destar (http://www.guidestar.org/ ) in the coming months. In addition, tools such as the Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health Community Need Index (CNI), will be used to continue to identify gaps in community resou rces and provide insight into further program development. Sharp will continue to explore work with HASD&IC and IPH to develop and implement Phase 2 of the 2022 CHNA. Phase 2 will focus on continued engagement of community partners to analyze and improve the CHNA process, as well as the hospital implementation strategies that address the 2022 CHNA findings. Thus, the CHNA process will evolve to meet the needs of our community members and support the work of our community partners who also address those id entified needs. Also, during Phase 2 , Sharp will take a closer look at th e findings that emerged during the collaborative 2022 CHNA process but for which the nature of Sharp's community engagement survey s provided limited opportunity for feedback \u2014 particularly Child & Youth Well -Being and Community Safety . Sharp will explore strategies to gather feedback on these needs through future community engagement processes. In addition, Sharp hospitals (including SMH and SMBHWN ), medical groups and healt h plans will continue advancing data integration and community referral efforts through partnership with 2 -1-1 San Diego's Community Information Exchange (CIE). The CIE includes a longitudinal client record with community member history, access to and use of social programs (e.g., housing, food banks, community clinics, etc.), emergency transport data and more. The CIE also includes a direct -referral feature, which allows for documented, bi - directional, closed -loop referrals between all CIE partners \u2014 including hospitals, clinics and social service programs. Currently, there are more than 115 community partners (organizations) participating in CIE, and more than 300,000 community members enrolled, with approximately 5,000 new community members enrolled each month. Sharp is the first integrated health system \u2014 including its hospitals, medical groups and health plan \u2014 to participate in the CIE. By leveraging this technology and expanding upon this capability for Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 164 shared data, consistent tracking and robust repor ting, the CIE partnership presents an exciting opportunity for Sharp to strengthen and evaluate the impact of clinical -community linkages for its patients and community members in need, particularly regarding social determinants of health .

Research continues to underscore that social determinants of health (SDOH) have a significant impact on a person's ability to access care and maintain health. Sharp's participation in the CIE pilot partnership promotes opportunities f or case managers and social workers across the system to provide more informed, holistic care to patients facing barriers, and make direct referrals to critical community -based resources to meet their needs. In addition, at the start of Year 3 of the par tnership, Sharp leadership approved moving forward with data integration of select CIE data with Sharp's Electronic Health Record system, in order to further increase and support utilization, and strengthen the community piece of Sharp's efforts to identif y and address SDOH and health equity in the communities it serves. Exploratory work is well underway to design the implementation strategy for this data integration over the next several months/year. Sharp teams continue to work closely with 2 -1-1 on the implementation and data integration plans for CIE, which includes ongoing metrics, such as CIE utilization across the system, referral tracking, impact on case management efficacy and successful connec tion to needed social services , health care utilization (e.g., inpatient readmissions, unnecessary emergency department Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 203Sharp Memorial Hospital and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Community Health Needs Assessment - Implementation Strategy Fiscal Years 2023 - 2026 Current as of: 9/7/2022 Page 20 of 90 Identified Community Health Need - Aging Care & Support Objectives/Anticipated Impact Strategy/Action Items Target Completion Date Responsible Party/ies Identified Themes in 2022 CHNA Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets, and Other Comments (ED) visits, length of stay, etc.) and others.

Not applicable (NA) a. NA NA NA Education Stigma Behavioral Health is identified as a health need in SMH's patient community , and a lthough SMH is not an LPS facility, SMH provides resources to address this priority. SMH employs a team of registered nurses and a nurse practitioner working under the direction of a California licensed psychiatric physician. The nurse practitioner s provide psychiatric assessm ent, treatment and medications to patients in the ED, observation units, and in-patient units at the request of the medical attending physician. An interdisciplinary Behavioral Health Committee provides evaluation, direction and oversight to assure behavio ral health -related education for facility staff and processes are optimized. Further , SMH's clinical social workers provide patients with support, education and resources to help address behavioral/emotional health issues that often accompany many health conditions (e.g., cancer, postpartum depression, physical rehabilitation, etc.). In addition , more comprehensive behavioral health needs of SMH's patient community are addressed through the programs/services provided th rough Sharp Mesa Vista Hospit al (SMV ) and Sharp McDonald Center, which are the major providers of behavioral health and chemical dependency services in SDC. SMV is located on the same campus as SMH , and is a collaborative partner to SMH in providing psychiatric care . 2.

Improve navigation of the health care system for cancer patients in San Diego County through patient navigation services. a. Continue to offer the cancer patient navigator program to SMH cancer patients. Ongoing SMH Clinical Case Manager, Oncology Administration Access to Health Care Patient Navigation Care Management In FY 2021, cancer patient navigators were diverted from cancer care to assist with COVID -19 patients and patients on other units. Due to the pandemic, the cancer centers also saw a decrease in patients. Despite these circumstances, a substantial number of patients were supported. In calendar year 2021 , more than 3,100 patients were assisted by S MH's cancer patient navigators in person and virtually . The team includes nurse patient navigators , licensed clinical social worker s (LCSW) , genetics counselor s, dietitian s and clinical trials specialist s. Nutrition plays a vital role in cancer care, and more than 600 patients were seen at the Cancer Centers of Sharp HealthCare (Cancer Centers of Sharp), which includes SCVMC , SGH and SMH , for nutritional assessment and ongoing support. Nurse navigators provided ongoing guidance for patients and families impacted by all cancer diagnoses through myriad supportive services, including referrals to numerous community agencies , explanation of procedures and te st results , assistance with financial resources and more. During an annual review with the navigators from the Cancer Centers of Sharp, the most significant challenge identified was the shortfall in providing navigation services to all Sharp cancer patien ts. An analysis of patients navigated by tumor site was completed using Navigation PowerForm documentation. The top three sites navigated in 2021 included breast, head and neck, brain and gastrointestinal tract cancers. With the recent addition of the hepa tobiliary tumor board, Sharp has increased the support this patient population needs from dedicated navigators and Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 207Sharp Memorial Hospital and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Community Health Needs Assessment - Implementation Strategy Fiscal Years 2023 - 2026 Current as of: 9/7/2022 Page 24 of 90 Identified Community Health Need - Cancer Objectives/Anticipated Impact Strategy/Action Items Target Completion Date Responsible Party/ies Identified Themes in 2022 CHNA Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets, and Other Comments dieti tians. In addition, the Cancer Centers of Sharp plan to revamp the current model for navigation and restructure navigator roles and responsibilities to better distribute resources to more disease sites. The Cancer Centers of Sharp share direct links to community resources and agencies by service needed as well as information on advance care planning (ACP) on sharp.com. The Cancer Cent ers of Sharp also include an online assessment on sharp.com for individuals to assess if at risk and qualify for a lung screening. Representatives throughout the Sharp system are exploring ways to further assist newly diagnosed cancer patients who are pa rticularly anxious at this vulnerable time. A new educational resource published in late FY 2021 \u2014 both printed and on sharp.com \u2014 provides a wealth of information for newly diagnosed patients including how to prepare for upcoming visits to cancer speciali sts; what they can do personally and with family and friends to prepare for the days ahead with treatment; and how to access information about cancer services and support provided by Sharp. While developing the brochure, access gaps were identified, and so special efforts are underway to ensure the brochure is easily accessible and that patients have reliable methods for questions to be answered in a timely manner. b. Provide and refine SMH Cancer Patient Navigation Distress Screening technology to screen, track and respond to psychological, spiritual, practical and other social needs experienced by Ongoing (evaluated annually) VP On cology Service Line SMH Cancer Patient Navigator Coordinator Care Management Continued goals for the Cancer Centers of Sharp's distress screening tool include expand ed use of the tool to increase the number of patients screene d at least one time, as well as the number of patients screened more than one time, especially at times of care transitions. COVID -19 had a substantial impact on the administration of the distress screening survey as well as im pacted results. In 2019, 2,327 surveys were completed versus only 1,483 in 2020, resulting in a 36% decrease. W hile facing the same challenges in Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 208Sharp Memorial Hospital and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Community Health Needs Assessment - Implementation Strategy Fiscal Years 2023 - 2026 Current as of: 9/7/2022 Page 25 of 90 Identified Community Health Need - Cancer Objectives/Anticipated Impact Strategy/Action Items Target Completion Date Responsible Party/ies Identified Themes in 2022 CHNA Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets, and Other Comments cancer patients and their families. Oncology Social Workers Sharp Nurses 2021 , the number of distress screenings increased to 1,655, but remained lower than pre -COVID -19 pandemic time s. Challenges in screening patients included intended brevity in patient visit times and exchange of materials to reduce COVID -19 exposure. Staff shortages impacted screening figures as well. In FY 2021, 39% of Sharp patients reported distress responses as serious or very serious concerns, a 3% increase from 2020. Also in 2021, patients with cancer at the Cancer Centers of Sharp expressed concern over the COVID -19 pandemic. The Cancer Centers of Sharp continue to be in frequent communication with patients, ensuring care is not disrupted. Financial concerns and health insurance remained a key source of distress for Sharp cancer patients. Other top concerns included worrying about the future and what lies ahead, pain, physical discomfort, exercise and physical activity and feeling too tired. Referrals are made to appropriate resources both within Sharp Healthcare and the greater community. Distress Screening Background : Beginning in June 2019, an electronic distress screening (available in both English and Sp anish), using a validated tool distributed by the Cancer Support Community, was implemented. The tool provides easier methods for completion, timely results sharing, report tabulation and chronologic comparison of results for each patient , for monitoring purposes . Algorithms were established for each question to identify information resources for areas of concern and staff member provided support if desired. Distress Screening \u2014 to assess psychological, social, spiritual and practical issues contributing to cancer patient distress - has been conducted at SMH over the past several years . This tool identifies patient needs in greater detail in order to make them actionable and rate them by i ntensity so that they may be prioritized and addressed appropriately. Routine reports including number of patients screened, Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 209Sharp Memorial Hospital and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Community Health Needs Assessment - Implementation Strategy Fiscal Years 2023 - 2026 Current as of: 9/7/2022 Page 26 of 90 Identified Community Health Need - Cancer Objectives/Anticipated Impact Strategy/Action Items Target Completion Date Responsible Party/ies Identified Themes in 2022 CHNA Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets, and Other Comments information on the issues that are most challenging for patients and the percentage of patients rated in high distress are reported to the Integrated Network Cancer Program (INCP) and to hospital entities annually. The information will drive efforts to target and provide additional support and resources to better meet our patient needs. c. Provide and refine SMH Cancer Patient Navigator PowerForm technology to screen, track and respond to psychological, spiritual, practical and other social needs experienced by cancer patients and their families. Ongoing (evaluated annually) VP Oncology Service Line Care Management Data Management/ Technology Similar to the SMH Cancer Patient Navigator PowerForm, a Social Work PowerForm was implemented in 2019. In 2020, the Social Work PowerForm was modified for better clarity and interpretation of social work documentati on. Cancer Patient Navigator PowerForm Background : Cancer patient navigators across Sharp collaborated to define, develop and propose a new Cerner Oncology Navigator PowerForm. The PowerForm was designed to standardize the cancer patient navigator's docu mentation, increase efficiency in patient care coordination, and improve overall patient care. By utilizing the PowerForm, navigators can document their assessment of patient needs and barriers to care , in addition to how they addressed patient unmet needs with appropriate internal and external support services and referrals. The documentation is annually reviewed to identify opportunities for improvement to the navigation program. 2. Increase cancer education and support for San Diego community members with cancer diagnoses. a.

Collaborate with community organizations and health care professionals to share best practices and provide education around human trafficking. Ongoing SMH Assistant Librarian Trauma - Informed Care team at SMV Collaboration Education Trauma Sharp FY 2022 - FY 2023 plans: Collaborate with the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) to address human trafficking by improving and implementing protocols in regional health care systems to identify and support patients who have been trafficked Collaborate with HASD&IC on additional continuing education addressing human t rafficking in health care settings Explore training human trafficking survivors to teach best practices to health care systems Share the trauma -informed care (TIC) series with other stakeholders and organizations Sharp's Continuing Medical Education (CME) Department has provided numerous CME activities targeted to Sharp and non -Sharp community physicians and providers related to human trafficking. The Health Subcommittee for the San Diego Regional Human Trafficking and Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children Advisory Council (Health Subcommittee) is collaborating with local stakeholders and HASD&IC to include human trafficking in HASD&IC's Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and promote TIC in all clinical settings. In an effort to equip Sharp and community health systems with TIC skills, Sharp collaborated with the Health Subcommittee, Palomar Health and the Institute on Violence, Abuse and Trauma to create a TIC continuing education series for physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, licensed marriage and family therapists, LCSWs , and other interested individuals within and Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 266Sharp Memorial Hospital and Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns Community Health Needs Assessment - Implementation Strategy Fiscal Years 2023 - 2026 Current as of: 9/7/2022 Page 83 of 90 Identified Community Health Need - Community Safety Objectives/ Anticipated Impact Strategy/Action Items Target Completion Date Responsible Party/ies Identified Themes in 2022 CHNA Evaluation Methods, Measurable Targets, and Other Comments outside the medical profession . Topics include ACE ( Adverse Childhood Experience ) score \u2014 a metric that represents the amount of toxic stress endured during childhood ; PEARR (provide privacy, education, ask, respect and respond) Tool \u2014 an effective, evidence -based and trauma -informed assessment for human trafficking , domestic violence and related violence; Neurobiology of Trauma ; Vicarious Trauma ; and Trauma -Informed Principles. The series addresses TIC, a gap in addressing human trafficking, which is vital to supporting patients who have been trafficked as well as the SDOH that contribute to human trafficking and similar exploitation, including poor health outcomes. An evidence -based and trauma -informed assessment like the PEARR Tool is more effective than screening. A trauma -informed assessment using the PEARR Tool facilitates discussions between patients and clinicians about personal safety , and hand offs to social work ers should be done with consent and transparency to avoid stigmatizing patients. TIC is a best practice to help patients feel safe requesting help, even if they do not request help to exit the ir situation. Since disclosure is not the goal, patients do not feel manipulated and are more likely to seek medical attention as needed. As part of the Health Subcommittee in FY 2021, the SMH assistant librarian presented A Trauma -Informed Approach to Human Trafficking at three continuing education events to nearly 90 clinical staff, which included nurse practitioners, social workers and registered nurses. The SMH team member was a facilitator at the Health, Education, Advocacy, Linkage Trafficking Train the Trainer Academy, along with a cohort of 42 individuals.

The purpose was to gather feedback on the top health needs (Figure 1) that were identified in the 2019 Sharp HealthCare Community Health Needs Assessment ( CHNA ). In addition, the survey sought to collect further input on issues such as the impact of COVID -19, access to health care, stigma, public charge, and immi gration. Figure 1. Identified Top Health Needs from CHNA Phase 1 Findings Methodology An electronic survey was created through Qualtrics and distributed to the following Sharp teams that were engaged in the phase 1 process : case management leadership, cancer navigators/social workers, diabetes educators, patient and family advisory council (PFAC) members, Mary Birch social workers and case managers, senior health center staff. The survey was open for approximately 7 weeks from June 16 , 2020 through August 7, 2020 with a total of 18 respondents completing the survey. An introductory email with a link to the survey provided both an explanation of the purpose and instructions for completing the survey. The survey asked respondents to identify the ir participation in CHNA Phase 1, the group they represent at Sharp HealthCare, and the Sharp entity they are aff iliated wit h. Based on the top health needs identified from the 2019 Sharp HealthCare CHNA, survey participants were asked to provide their agreement and additional Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 2783 | P a g e comments on the findings, and to discuss on the impact of the top health needs due to COVID - 19. The survey also collected participants' inputs on several topics related to the top health needs including the community's member's ability to access health care, stigma in health care settings, ways to address stigma, public charge, immigration, patient financial assistance program, and future com munication. Survey data was automatically captured through Qualtrics and analyzed through Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) and NVIVO. All percentages were calculated based on the total number of survey participants responding to the question. Participation in CHNA Phase 1 Question 1.

This feedback helps guide planning for future CHNAs, as well as programs to address those identified needs.The figure illustrates the interactive nature of SDOH and health conditions \u2014 each influencing the other. The 2019 CHNA community engagement activities also revealed an underlying theme of stigma, which will be analyzed further in Phase 2 of the CHNA. 1 https:/ /www.cdc.gov/socialdeterminants/index.htm Sharp 2019 CHNA \u2014 Identified Priority Health Needs Access to Health Care Community & Social Support Economic Security Education Homelessness & Housing Instability Unintentional Injury & Violence Aging Concerns Behavioral Health Cancer Chronic Conditions Maternal & Prenatal Care, including High-Risk PregnancyAs a not-for-profit organization, Sharp HealthCare places great value on the health and wellness of the San Diego community. This value is reflected in Sharp's mission to improve the health of those it serves with a commitment to excellence in all that it does. Since 1995, Sharp has participated in a countywide collaborative to conduct a triennial Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in an effort to identify the priority health needs facing the San Diego community. In 2013, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act presented a new requirement for not-for-profit hospitals and health care systems to develop a separate CHNA for each individually licensed hospital. To address these new requirements, since 2013, Sharp has partnered with other hospitals and health care systems in San Diego County to create a collaborative, countywide CHNA \u2014 an effort led by the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties (HASD&IC) and in contract with the Institute for Public Health (IPH) at San Diego State University. The collaborative CHNA provides the foundation for the development of CHNAs for each Sharp hospital. In 2019, Sharp contracted separately with IPH to develop tailored CHNAs through two phases: Phase 1 Sharp conducted focus groups, interviews and an online survey to collect feedback from Sharp clinicians and staff, as well as patients and community members served specifically by each of its hospitals. This allowed Sharp to better understand the unique needs of individuals who live in the communities it serves. Phase 1 findings identified the priority needs, including health conditions and social determinants of health (SDOH \u2014 conditions in the places where people live, learn, work and play)1 highlighted in the figure below. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 372Annual Implementation Strategy In response to the 2019 CHNA findings, each Sharp hospital created an implementation strategy that highlights the programs, services and resources provided by the hospital to address the identified priority health needs in its community. The table below presents an overview of the types of strategies offered by Sharp.

Stakeholder/Customer(s): Sharp Community Benefit, Clinical Effectiveness, Sharp Rees -Stealy Medical Group, Sharp Community Medical Group, Oncology and Behavior al Health service line leadership and the System Emergency Department (ED) Collaborative Project Goals and Planned Actions: Sharp's CHNA is a report issued every three years, which supports Sharp's community pillar \u2014 one of seven Pillars of Excellence that provide the foundation for Sharp vision to transform the health care experience . For more information on Sharp's Pillars of Excellence, see Appendix B: An Overview of Sharp Health Care. Through the 2022 CHNA pro cess, Sharp will be able to analyze data for key questions related to the needs of our community. Ultimately, the data will be used to assist in the development of programs and services to support the health of the community, including strategies to addres s health equity. Analytics Deliverables: Clinical Analytics created a full report including data tables, visualizations, and narratives to provide effective data storytelling. Key Business Requirements and Metrics: Data Source(s): Hospital and clinic electronic medical record and claims data, managed care enrollment, clinical registries Population Definition: Relevant Date(s): Include patients discharged between fiscal year 2016 and 2021 (FY 2016 and FY 2021 ), to allow for a five -year view to analyze trends for activity or behavior prior to and during the COVID -19 pandemic Topics of Interest:220 1) For all Sharp hospital visits ( ED, outpatient, and inpatient), has there been an increase in the percentage of patients with a behavioral health or substance use diagnosis (regardless of primary reason for the visit)? 2) What is the overall trend of oncology screening visit volumes, specifically for mammogram and colonoscopy? Have visit volumes recovered since the onset of 220 All data includes race, ethnicity, gender, home zip code, and primary language spoken data elements to allow for basic equity analysis. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 376 the COVID -19 pandemic? What are the effects of these volume trends? Analysis includes: a. Analysis of trends among new onset cancer diagnoses by stage 3) Are patients' health conditions worsening due to lack of care during the pandemic? What are the mortality trends for non -COVID patient populations during the pandemic? 4) How do comorbid conditions (i.e. hypertension, diabetes, obesity) affect outcomes for COVID -19 patients? Analysis inc ludes: a. Likelihood of inpatient hospital admission based on certain comorbidities b. Likelihood of requiring intensive care unit (ICU) or Critical Care treatment based on certain comorbidities c. Likelihood of survival to discharge based on certain comorbidit ies Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 377 Sharp 2022 CHNA Clinical Analytics: Key Takeaways Behavioral Health Disorders among Acute Inpatients In FY 2021, Sharp 's acute care hospitals admitted over 38,000 individuals as inpatients with a behavioral health diagnosis. This is a steady increase year -over-year from FY 2016. This increase is likely the result of both improved documentation and actual disease prevalence in the community. Follow -up actions are being planned with Sharp behavioral health leadership on how to create a shared vision to address the growing behavioral health disease burden among the inpatient population . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 378 Impact of COVID -19 Pandemic on Oncology Screening Volumes and New Cancer Diagnoses As expected, screening volumes dipped significantly during the COVID -19 pandemic. While there has been a rise in stage 1 cancer diagnoses, this is a continued trend from previous years and may or may not be related to the reduction in screenings from the previous year. More time and analysis is needed to assess the impact of the screening reduction on oncology patient volumes. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 379 Effect of COVID -19 Pandemic on Patients with Chronic Health Conditions Examining observed to expected mortality (O/E) ratios168 during the time p eriod FY 2016 to FY 2021, there was an increase in deaths due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, and hip fracture. There was a slight increase in deaths due to stroke and a slight decrease in deaths due to heart failure. However, further analysis is needed to determine if this variation is statistically significant. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 380 Effect of Comorbid Conditions on COVID -19 Outcomes Among COVID -19 patients admitted to the hospital, 61% presented with hypertension, 39% p resented with diabetes, and 43% presented with obesity. Patients presenting to the ED with COVID -19 and hypertension are 2.5 times as likely to be admitted to the hospital compared to patients with COVID -19 without hypertension. There was a varying risk br eakdown by race and ethnicity for hypertension, diabetes, and obesity. Patients with diabetes were much more likely to require a stay in the ICU. COVID -19 patients with hypertension and diabetes had higher mortality rates than those without those condition s. Further analysis is required to fully understand these trends.

Sharp's 2022 CHNA process focuse d on the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic . It also touched on telemedicine and the impact of Sharp employee education efforts. Two surveys were distributed to Sharp staff. The first assessed the impact of COVID -19 on Sharp patients (Survey One), and the second assessed the impact on Sharp employees (Survey Two ). A total of 108 employees representing different Sharp entities and occupations completed the surveys. Survey One results show ed that COVID -19 has had significant, serious effects on the needs of Sharp patients. The patient needs identified as most concerning related to behavioral health : increas ed isolation among senio rs; increased rates of anxiety and depression ; and decreased access to emotional and social support and behavioral health services. Respondents indicated that certain populations have been especially impacted by COVID -19 (e.g., seniors, people with limited English proficiency, racial/ethnic minorities among others) , but respondents also noted that the pandemic's impact is pervasive, affecting all patients. Survey One respondents gave many examples of Sharp programs and resources that address these needs, including education, referrals for case management and other services, patient outreach and follow -up, and behavioral health telehealth options. However, most respondents believed that more efforts are critical . They proposed suggestions around increas ing \"human contact\" in order to better meet patient needs . Implementing more follow -up calls, home visits, caregiver support , and strategies for safe visitation during the pandemic were frequent recommendations . Furth er, respon dents emphasized that Sharp must seek to increase the number and availability of behavioral health providers \u2014 including those who speak patients' primary languages \u2014 and to decrease access barriers to these providers. Survey One also queried employees about the use of telemedicine, specifically virtual video visits. Results showed that virtual video visits are not always easy for patients to use due to lack of acces s, knowledge and affordability, as well as unreliable technology . In addition , many patients prefer in -patient visits. Nearly all respondents agreed , however, that telehealth modalities - including video and phone - are potentially beneficial to patients. Survey Two findings highlight ed serious concerns about the well -being of Sharp employees, particularly their levels of anxiety, stress, depression, and frustration. Respondents indicated that e mployees are more likely to wish to change careers or leave the workforce, are more isolated, urgently need access to behavioral health assistance and have limited access to emotional and social supports. Most respondents believe d that these concerns will not lessen in the coming year. Sharp has implemented solid strategies to address employee an xiety, stress, and frustration through programs like the Employee Assistance Program (EAP), Best Health, Safe Speak, leadership development , and wellness resources. However, Survey Two participants noted that Sharp lacks adequate efforts to address the inc reased Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 3897 | P a g e desire to change careers or leave the workforce. Suggestions to better meet employee needs included expanding current mental health supports, increasing communication about available behavioral health services, hiring more staff, offering on -site ch ildcare, making EAP entity -based rather than centralized, increasing communication between employees and leadership, work -life balance programs, reevaluating the compensation philosophy, better new graduate programs, and flexibility in hiring new staff. Su rvey respondents recognized that Sharp has many competing priorities that inhibit or complicate the implementation of these recommendations, including finances, inadequate staffing, staff and leadership being stretched too thin, space, COVID -related restri ctions, interest, and pressure about patient satisfaction scores. Both surveys asked respondents to comment on their utilization of educational opportunities at Sharp. Most respondents attended educational sessions, and the most popular sessions included Leadership Development, Safe Speak, and Current Conversations. For those who were unable to attend, work schedule conflicts were the primary reason given. Respondents shared that Sharp's current e ducational opportunities better prepared them to meet patien t needs, relate to patients and fellow team members, and to protect their own mental health and well-being. Respondents identified care in the senior community, defining and applying cultural humility, and implicit/unconscious bias and its impact on decis ion making as the topics of greatest interest for future educational sessions . Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 3908 | P a g e I. Introduction Since 1995, Sharp Healthcare (Sharp) has conducted triennial needs assessments in the community to identify the priority health needs of the people and communities Sharp serves . These Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNA) serve two purposes: (1) they allow Sharp to take a community -informed approach to program planning , including the creation of new programs and the expansion or modification of existi ng programs; and (2) they meet the requirements of both California Senate Bill 697 of 1994, which requires California not -for-profit hospitals and health care systems to complete triennial CHNAs, as well as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2013, which mandates CHNAs for all not-for-profit hospitals and health care systems in the U.S. . The focus of the 2022 CHNA was informed by the significant , severe consequences of the global COVID -19 pandemic on both the community and the health care sys tem. As of February 2022 , 8.4 million people in California have reportedly tested positive for COVID -19, and more than 80 ,000 have died.1 In San Diego County alone , nearly 700,000 people have tested positive for COVID -19, and 4,686 have died.2 The ongoing emergence of new variants of COVID -19 lends even more urgency to this issue as hospitals and health care systems, Sharp among them, grapple with how to meet the ongoing demands on its providers and systems while continuing to provide the highe st quality of health care to a growing patient population with more intense needs. In May of 2020, as part of Phase 2 of the 2019 Sharp CHNA, a small survey was conducted with 16 Sharp employees . Results from the survey clearly showed that COVID -19 was already negatively affecting the community; three -quarters of respondents (75.0%) indicated that they observed some impact on the CHNA - identified community health needs due to COVID -19. In that survey, participants noted that a number of areas of community ne ed had been affected by COVID -19, including access to health care, aging concerns, behavioral health, cancer, community and social support, economic security, education, housing instability and homelessness, maternal health, and stigma. The 202 2 CHNA , described in part in this report, built on these data to create a more comprehensive assessment of the current state of health and well -being for the patients, employees , and community members served by Sharp . Two surveys were created. The goal of the fi rst (called Survey One in this report) was to further understand Sharp employees' perceptions about how COVID -19 is affecting their patients, Sharp's existing efforts to address these effect s, and ideas about how to better serve the patient population. It is becoming increasingly evident that COVID -19 is also taking a toll on health care workers and those working within health care systems .3 Sharp's 2022 CHNA, thus also included a focus on the needs of these essential workers. The goal of the second surv ey (Survey Two) was to garner information about the needs of Sharp employees based on the perspective of non-clinical Sharp employees who manage human resource and other 1 https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/california -covid -cases.html 2 https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/community_epidemiology/dc/2019 -nCoV/status.html Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 3919 | P a g e employee -related functions. The methods utilized and the findings from both surveys are presented in this report. Sharp contracted with the San Diego State University (SDSU) Institute for Public Health (IPH) to design the survey instrument a nd analyze and report results . II. Methodology Survey questions were d eveloped in collaboration between Sharp and SDSU IPH and focused on the impact of COVID -19 on patients and employees ( see Appendix B and Appendix D for a copy of both surveys ). Question design was informed by survey findings from phase two of the 2019 CHNA. The s urvey was created in Qualtrics , a survey software, and distributed via an emailed link to two sets of Sharp employees. Survey One was distri buted to a set of clinical employees who have extensive knowledge about patient well -being, including case managers and case management leadership, cancer navigators , social workers, diabetes educators, and others who came from a variety of Sharp entities including Sharp Community Medical Group, Sharp Grossmont Hospital, and Sharp Memorial Hospital. Survey Two was distributed to employees who are focused on employee -related services, primarily human resources teams from Sharp System Services. The link for Survey One was emailed to employees on October 6, 2021 , and the link for Survey Two was emailed October 12, 2021. Each email included an explanation about the purpose of the survey and instructions for completion. A reminder to complete the survey was emailed a week later. The survey closed on October 22 , 2021 . Descriptive statistics were utilized to analyze the results of all close -ended survey questions. P ercentages were calculated based on the total number of su rvey participants responding to the question. Content analysis was utilized for open -ended questions, and results were grouped into categories and themes. III. Survey One Results : Patient Impacts Sharp HealthCare Representation and Entity Affiliation The first survey (Survey One) focused on the impact of COVID -19 on patient s, and 92 employees responded . Question 1. Sharp HealthCare Representation (n=92) Who/what group do you currently represent at Sharp HealthCare? (check all that apply) As seen in the Figure 1 below, the majority of respondents (67%) indicated that they were social workers or case managers. Other representation included Sharp Oncology Department (11%), Diabetes Educators (11%), Sharp Community Information Exchange (2%), Sharp Rees -Stealy Population Health (2%), and other (12%). Other groups listed included : Behavioral Health Unit; Geriatric Dep artment at Sharp Grossmont Hospital; Hospice and Palliative Care ; Intern for Social Work ; Patient Access Services II; Registered Nurse Supervisor Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital Outpatient Services; Sharp Community Medical Group Case Management; Sharp Addiction Medicine Service Line ; Sharp HealthCare Clinical Effectiveness, Admin ; Sharp Mesa V ista Mental Health Outpatient ; and Sharp Psych iatric Outpatient .

Respondents indicated the level of impact COVID -19 has had -- no impact, minor impact, moderate impact, major impact, or don't know -on a list of ten clinical needs and seven social needs . They were then asked to choose which of those patient needs were most severely impacted by COVID. For those chosen, respondents were then asked to comment on particular populations affected, Sharp progr ams and services that address those needs, and other ideas about ways to address the needs . A total of 92 people responded to these questions. Note that r espondents could answer, \"Don't know how patients are currently impacted .\" These responses were exclu ded from the analysis; therefore, the total number of responses to each question varies. As described below, the six clinical and social needs identified as the most serious ly impacted by COVID during the past year were: (1) increased isolation among seniors; (2) increased anxiety ; (3) increased depression ; (4) limited a ccess to behavioral health services; ( 5) increased financial insecurity; and ( 6) limited access to emotional and social support. Question 3. COVID -19 Impact on Clinical Needs (n=92) How is COVID currently impacting the clinical needs of patients? As seen in Table 1, most survey participants felt that COVID -19 had a moderate to major impact on all but one of the patients' clinical needs listed (access to essential patient or durable medical equipment supplies) . They were nearly unanimous that COVID -19 had a moderate o r major impact on the isolation of seniors/older adults and on rates of anxiety and depression . The vast majority of survey respondents also indicated that COVID -19 has had a major or moderate impact on limiting access to behavioral health care (91%); limi ting access to specialty care (86%); increasing fear about utilizing health care (85%); and limiting access to primary care (79%).

Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 42745 | P a g e V. Conclusions The Sharp 2022 CHNA survey received a robust response from Sharp team members. Altogether, 108 employees representing many occupations and entities of Sharp answered the surveys. These team members were responsive to all survey questions and made good use of the open -ended questions to share ideas about how to improve both patient and employee care . Together, the results of the two surveys suggest that both patients and employees are hurting . And w hile survey respondents recognized and appreciated the services and resources Sharp offers, they also reported that more personal support for patients an d employees is needed. At the same time, respondents were cognizant that Sharp's health care system, its leaders, providers, and staff are all stretched thin, rendering meeting the se critical needs extremely challenging. The results of the survey are summarized below, using the respondents ' own words to contextualize the data whenever possible. Patient Impacts (Survey One ) Survey results provide clear evidence that COVID -19 has had significant, serious effects on the patients who Sharp serves. More th an three -quarters of survey participants indicated that COVID -19 has had a negative impact on a wide variety of clinical and social issues, including: isolation among seniors/adults ; anxiety; depression ; access to primary and behavioral health care ; fear about utilizing health care; financial security ; access to social and emotional support, community resources, and transportation; employment stability; and food security. When asked to choose which issues were of most concern for patients, survey respondents answers were primarily centered on issues related to behavioral health. Respondents reported that t he issues most impacting patients were incr eased isolation among seniors and increased rates of anxiety and depression. At the same time, respondents indicated that patients have decreased access to the very resources that would help address these growing needs: emotional and social support and beh avioral health services. And while certain populations were of particular concern - among them caregivers of older adults, Medi -Cal and Medicare beneficiaries, people of limited English Proficiency, and racial/ethnic minorities (especially Hispanic and Bl ack/African American people), many respondents noted that these issues are affecting everyone. \"There is a mental health pandemic that is not being addressed across the board.\" -- Survey One Respondent Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 42846 | P a g e When asked if Sharp had programs and services to address these critical issues, the majority of survey respondents answered \"no.\" For example, 56% of responden ts said Sharp is not implementing programs/services to address increas ed isolation in seniors, and 71% of people said that Sharp is not addressing limited access to emotional and social support. Nevertheless, many examples of relevant Sharp programs and resources that target these types of behavioral health issues were offered. Sharp efforts noted by respondents included educational efforts like posters, newsletters, and emails, referrals for case management and other services, outreach and follow -up with p atients, and telehealth options such as online support groups. Several themes recurred among the respondents when queried about additional ways to address these issues. Respondents ' recommendations focused on providing more \"human contact,\" including impl ementing more follow -up calls with patients, and ideally, home visits; providing supportive services to caregivers; and enabling safe visitation even during COVID -19. They also discussed raising awareness about existing resources and expanding resources th at are already in place. Another area of focus was on increasing the number and availability of behavioral health providers, potentially through contractors , although respondents noted that behavioral health contractors are not widely available. They also discussed decreasing barriers to access to behavioral health providers . Recommendations included ensuring that everyone, including employees, understands how to access services ; addressing insurance coverage issues; and simplifying process to make appointments. Respondents also mentioned creating more community -based programs, and several recommendations emphasized the importance of offering behavioral health services in the pa tient's primary language. Several respondents noted the challenges associated with implementing these suggestions, including limited resources within Sharp and with other behavioral health providers. Virtual Visits (Survey One) When asked about virtual vi deo visits, the majority of survey participants indicated that virtual video visits were not easy for patients to access due to lack of access to, knowledge about, and ability to afford technology, as well as insufficient internet access and unreliable tec hnology. Most also agreed that many patients prefer in - patient visits for a better connection with their provider and confidence in their care. Despite these results, 95% of respondents agreed that many telehealth modalities are potentially beneficial to p atients, especially virtual video visits, electronic medical reminders, secure messaging, and electronic health education. Employee Impacts (Survey Two) Although the sample size was smaller (n=16) for the survey that assessed COVID -19 impacts on employees , results suggest serious concerns about the well -being of Sharp employees as well. The vast majority of survey participants (>75%) believe that COVID -19 has affected employees' levels of anxiety, stress, depression, and Case management, social work, and behavioral health programs are available at Sharp. However, many of these programs have limited resources, staffing shortag es, and large caseloads that do not allow adequate time to impact care. --Survey One Respondent Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 42947 | P a g e frustration. They indicated that em ployees are more likely to wish to change careers or leave the workforce and that they are more isolated. At the same time, team members are feeling more urgency about accessing behavioral health assistance but have limited access to emotional and social s upports. Few respondents indicated that they expected these issues to get better in the coming year; most indicated that they would either stay about the same or worsen. Fortunately, survey respondents believe that Sharp is implementing programs to address two of the most pressing of these concerns, including 1) increased anxiety or stress and 2) increased frustration or disengagement. For example, 100% of respondents agreed that Sharp has programs to address employees' increased anxiety and stress. Frequently cited examples of Sharp's efforts in these areas include the EAP, Best Health, Safe Speak, leadership training, and wellness resource s, especially mindfulness. Recommendations for other ways Sharp could address these issues included : expanding mental health supports currently in place and increasing communication about available services; hiring more staff; on -site childcare; making EAP entity -based rather than centralized; and having leadership meet with team members. The third issue chosen as most s everely impacting employees was an increased desire to change careers or leave the workforce, and for this issue, 78% of survey respondents indicated that Sharp does not have programs or services in place to alleviate this problem. Survey participants also noted the difficulty of addressing this issue, noting how ubiquitous it is. Recommendations about efforts that could be made to address the increased desire to change careers or leave the workplace including increasing communication to discover underlyin g issues, work -life balance programs, reevaluating the compensation philosophy, better new graduate programs, and flexibility in hiring new staff. \"It's hard to {make recommendations} as many healthcare workers are deciding to get out altogether. - -Survey Two Respondent \"Create opportunities for employees to hear from others, maybe even leaders, who may have experienced the same thing.\" - Survey Two Respondent \"Leaders should meet with team members where they are to listen to their needs rather than sending emails or memos.\" - Survey Two Respondent Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 43048 | P a g e Survey respondents recognized and appreciated Sharp's many competing priorities to manage. They underst ood that the major barrier to more fully meeting patient and employee needs is limited resources for multiple, competing priorities. Major competing priorities listed included finances and fear of financial failure , staffing, staff and leadership stretched t oo thin, space, COVID -related restrictions, interest, employees feeling that they don't have the time to care for themselves, and patient satisfaction scores. To address these constraints, suggestions included supporting leaders, engaging leaders in this issue, making presentations virtual or available via video at any time, using interns, grants and support from executive leadership, and partnering with other organizations on new initiatives . Respondents emphasized the importance of addressing employee w ell-being and reducing turnover, as described by this Survey Two respondent: \"Actually, that is it...too many competing priorities without though on teams and individual employees.\" -Survey Two Respondent \"How can we expect leaders to support their team when they are so stretched? As a director, I have no lea ds or supervisors to assist me. I want so much to be there for my team, but I cannot due to the lack of resources for me.\" --Survey Two Respondent. \"Our conservative approach over the years has kept lay -offs at a minimum and has kept our ratings high. Ow we're experiencing turnover like never before which requires us to ch ange with the time.. .combine better pay with a sense of community, and our staff will feel valued and will most likely stay as a proud member of what our organization offers the community. \" --Survey Two Respondent. Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 43149 | P a g e Education (Surveys One and Two) Both surveys asked respondents to comment on their utilization of educational opportunities at Sharp. In Survey One, 62% of respond ents had attended educational sessions; in Survey Two nearly everyone had. The most popular sessions included Leadership Development, Safe Speak, and Current Conversations. For those who were unable to attend, work schedule conflicts were the primary reaso n given; however, some noted feeling too overwhelmed to participate. Most respondents felt that the sessions were impactful. They indicated that these educational opportunities better prepared them to meet patient needs, to relate to patients, to relate to fellow team members, and to protect their own mental health and well -being. The topics of greatest interest for future educational sessions were care in the senior community, defining and applying cultural humility, and implicit/unconscious bias and its impact on decision making. Final Thoughts and Next Steps As evidenced throughout this report, the need for increased support and human connection in health care - both for patients and staff - is essential to address the most acute needs experienced by Sharp's community. Patients would benefit from follow -up cal ls, home visits, and visitors when they are in the hospital. Employees would like to have more opportunities to meet with and hear from leadership, to hear about other employees' experiences, and to participate in educational sessions on their own time. In addition, most critically, it seems clear that the community is in a behavioral health crisis. And while the behavioral health of patients and employees is worsening, the availability of behavioral health providers has decreased and access to timely behav ioral health care services has become even more difficult. Respondents emphasized that efforts must be made to increase the availability of behavioral health care providers and to ensure easy access to them for both patients and employees. These findings w ill help guide Sharp's internal discussions and program planning t o address these complex issues with engagement, care and empathy. \"I can't even begin to think of what I might benefit from, there is not time to care for oneself.\" -- Survey One Respondent Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 43250 | P a g e Appendix A: Survey One, Additional Data Q3.

Given its importance, we would like to hear your feedback and recommendations related to this e ducation. Background : Stigma can be generally defined as negative attitudes or beliefs towards another individual or group which can result in shame, embarrassment, or fear. Stigma in health care settings was identified in the 2019 CHNA as a key health equity issue. Community members highlighted stigma as a central barrier to accessing care, seeking treatment and managing health, all which lead to significant health disparities. Stigma was also observed by a significant proportion of Sharp health care professionals who participated the Phase 2 CHNA Survey conducted in Summer 2020. Further, stigma associated with COVID -19 diagnoses or vaccination status has recently been identified as a key issue. 10.

Based on demographic and economic statistics, the CNI provides a score for every populated ZIP code in the United States on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0. A score of 1.0 indicates a ZIP code with the least need, while a score of 5.0 represents a Z IP code with the most need compared to the US national average (score of 3.0). The CNI is strongly linked to variations in community healthcare needs and is a good indicator of a community's demand for a range of healthcare services. Not-for-profit and community -based hospitals, for whom c ommunity need is central to the mission of service , are often challenged to prioritize and effectively distribute hospital resources . The CNI can be used to help them identify speci fic initiatives best designed to address the health disparities of a given community. Additionally, the CNI can be shared with community partners and used to justify grants or resource allocations for community initiatives. T he increased tra nsparency of hospital operations , with quality report cards and financial disclosures , has highlighted the need for community benefit efforts to be come strategic and targeted . While l ocal community needs assessments will always play a central role in this process, they are often voluminous and difficult to communicate . The CNI should be used as part of a larger community need assessment to pinpoint specific areas that have greater need than others. Methodology The CNI score is an average of five different barrier scores that measure various socio -economic indicators of each community using the 2021 source data . The barrier score s are listed below along with the individual 2021 statistics analyzed for each barrier. These barriers, and the statisti cs that comprise them, were carefully chosen and tested individually by both Dignity Health and IBM Watson Health : 1. Income Barrier Percentage of households below poverty line, with head of household age 65 or more Percentage of families with children unde r 18 below poverty line Percentage of single female -headed families with children under 18 below poverty line 2. Cultural Barrier Percentage of population that is minority (including Hispanic ethnicity) Percentage of population over age 5 that speaks English poorly or not at all 3. Education Barrier Percentage of population over 25 without a high school diploma Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 526\u00a92021 I BM Watson Health Page 2 4. Insurance Barrier Percentage of population in the labor force, aged 16 or more, without employm ent Percentage of population without health insurance 5. Housing Barrier Percentage of households renting their home Every populated ZIP code in the United States is assigned a barrier score of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 depending upon the ZIP code national rank (quintile). A score of 1 represents the lowest rank nationally for the statistics listed, while a score of 5 indicates the high est rank nationally. For all barriers, ZIP codes with score s of 1 or 2 have a smal ler percentage of the population facing the barrier than the national average , while ZIP codes with a score of 4 or 5 have a higher percentage. ZIP codes with a score of 3 have a similar percentage of the population as the national average. For the two bar riers with only one statistic each (education and housing), IBM Watson Health used only the single statistic listed to calculate the barrier score. For the three barriers with more than one component statistic (income, cultural and insurance), IBM Watson Health first analyzed the variation and contribution of each statistic for its barrier , and then weighted each component statistic appropriately when calculating the barrier score. After each ZIP code is assigned its barrier scores (from 1 to 5 ), the five barrier scores are averaged together to yield the CNI score. Each of the five barrier scor es receives equal weight (20% each) in the composite CNI score. A score of 1.0 indicates a ZIP code with the least need, while a score of 5.0 represents a ZIP code with the most need. Data Sources 2021 Demographic Data, \u00a9 2021 The Claritas \u00a9 2021 The Claritas Company 2021 Insurance Coverage Estimates, IBM Watson Health Applications and Caveats CNI scores are not calculated for non -populated ZIP codes. These ZIP codes include such areas as national parks, public spaces, post office boxes , airports, and large unoccupied buildings. IBM Watson Health uses a weighted average technique based on 2021 population numbers to calculate the CNI score for a given communit y: First, the CNI value for each ZIP code is multiplied by the 2021 population for the same ZIP code. Second, the \"CNI X 2021 population \" products for the community ZIP codes are summed . Finally , the summed value is divided by the 2021 community population. The result yields a weighted CNI average for all ZIP codes combined. CNI scores for ZIP codes with small populations ( fewer than 100 people) may be less accurate . This is because the s ample of respondents to the 2010 census is too small to provide accurate statistics for such ZIP codes. This issu e is mitigated by either eliminating such ZIP codes from your analysis completely, or by making sure that low population ZIP codes are combined with other surrounding high po pulation ZIP codes using the weighted average technique described above.

Given the rapid development and growth in young children, these delays in services mean that we are missing critical opportunities to intervene and support them and their caregivers \u2014 increasing their risk for additional challenges in school, with their families, and other systems in the future. \" KEY INFORMANT \"We run a county -wide program for complex children with both developmental a nd behavioral health needs from 0-5 years old .

And then people of color have most of those jobs. And ...in many cases, a greater risk of complications because of their comorbid conditions. So , all of those factors place these populations at greater risk for developing the disease if they're exposed, and further for being hospitalized or dying from the illness. \" KEY INFORMANT \"While the temporary expansion of federal nutrition assistance programs during COVID has played a pivotal role in helping many households meet their food need s each month; we know that looming expirations of these flexibilities will result in potentially devastating benefits cliffs for hundreds of thousands of San Diegans. In addition to navigating broader long -term economic impacts of COVID, recipients will on ce again need to think about how to meet their food needs after CalFresh/SNAP runs out two -thirds of the way through the month and face ensuing intersectional health implications of episodic hunger.\" KEY INFORMANT \"I'm not talking about a concern. I'm talking about a deep fear. I never knew the rawness of it, how afraid they are.\" FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANT \"Our undocumented folks have really, really struggled in particular ... The last administration being in place during the beginning of the pandemic ...created this space where undocumented folks felt like they couldn't come forward for any type of help whatsoever to any government agency.\" FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANT \"While there have been a lot of really fantastic resources that have come out [during the pand emic] like rental assistance and stuff like that, our folks who are undocumented don't qualify for that. \" KEY INFORMANT Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 551 \"We've seen a lot of folks experience labor trafficking through spaces where maybe they were told, \"Hey, we'll give you free room and bo ard and we'll pay you if you do this in -home healthcare service for us.\" Then ended end up being labor trafficking, a process as a result where literally there's that coercion of, they care about the person that they're caring for, and so they don't want t o leave that person .\" KEY INFORMANT \"Housing insecurity, period, and the threat of that has become a really big driver in the pandemic in particular for both sex and labor trafficking. \" FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANT \"Thinking about housing insecurity in particul ar and the struggle for many of our clients to find places that they could live that are affordable, especially because the pandemic has actually made housing costs skyrocket throughout San Diego County. And so it's made it that much more difficult for fol ks with unstable income\" KEY INFORMANT \"People are desperate for housing. Our calls are housing, housing, housing. Getting a vaccine becomes low on the list when you need housing.\" FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANT \"When the moratorium on evictions are lifted, I believe that there are going to be many families losing their homes, where they rent. I think it's really difficult for some families to catch up. I mean, if you're living month to month, and then you're [try ing to] catch up [on] payments and [do] not have access to rental assistance, even though it's out there...There will be a wave of families losing their homes.\" KEY INFORMAN T \"When a household's budget is already limited due to expenses or when an unexpected surgery occurs and now, a person or family does not have enough savings to count on, less money becomes available to spend on food. \" FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANT \"Even if parents can find an infant toddler slot, it's going to cost them ... it's [said to be] mo re than college tuition a year .\" KEY INFORMANT Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 552 \"The desperation that families feel to get that child care subsidy is fierce and it leads to just this ...level of stress and anger that we hear from parents rightfully so that they cannot access this thing that would change their lives, this one resource right that could open the door to a completely different future .\" KEY INFORMANT \"I get a lot of clients...that are afraid to go back to get their needs met because they can't afford their copayments, or they have huge astronomical bills from the hospital they can't pay .\" FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANT \"I took a [community member] that was having severe pain to the ER and guided them via text on what to do or ask for. He was worried to go in because of lack of insurance a nd the fear of receiving a large hospital bill. \" FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANT Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 553 Appendix N Map of Sharp HealthCare Locations Sharp Memorial Hospital 2022 Community Health Needs Assessment 554 Appendix O Sharp HealthCare Involvement in Community Organizations The list below shows the involvement of Sharp HealthCare executive leadership and other staff in community organizations and coalitions in fiscal year 2021.
