DRS(Decompression, Reduction and Stabilization) is a state-of-the-art technology protocol used to gradually relieve disc compression and other related disc conditions often associated with neck and low back pain: herniated and bulging disc, degenerative disc disease, sciatica pain, facet syndrome, numbness and tingling of the legs and even relapsed or failed back surgeries. Why should I consider DRS? DRS therapy is revolutionary. It is the only treatment that was developed by a team of specialists including Neurosurgeons, Orthopedic Surgeons, Physiatrists, Osteopaths, Chiropractors, Neurologists and Physical Therapists. DRS therapy is proven and effective. The procedure has been studied extensively and validated clinically. Thousands of patients have been successfully treated. DRS therapy is non-surgical and non-invasive. The complications from surgery can be severe and may result in debilitating conditions. DRS Therapy is painless and involves no recovery time. THE DRS Protocol Is: - Nonsurgical - Comfortable - Restores you to a normal and productive life Is chronic pain a common condition? Chronic pain is a very serious condition, yet until recently there was no satisfactory treatment. Pain medications do not always work; even when they do work, they do not solve the problem. Their long-term use is associated with risks, and sometimes they cause addiction. Epidural injections sometimes relieve the pain partially and temporarily, but they do not cure the underlying problems which cause back and neck pain. Does the DRS Protocol involve surgery or injection? No. The DRS Protocol is completely non-invasive, is non-surgical, and involves no injections. Not only is the DRS Protocol safe and painless, it's also comfortable and relaxing. What about surgery? Surgical procedures may relieve the pain; however, they change the anatomy of the back, are painful, have complications and a significant rate of failure. Many patients feel much worse after surgery than before it. What is Spinal Decompression? Spinal decompression is a procedure used to alleviate certain types of back and neck pain. Spinal decompression can be achieved both surgically and non-surgically. Both types of procedure have a number of drawbacks and benefits, although both are considered by most physicians and health care professionals as viable options to treat conditions caused by the compression of spinal nerves. What is Spinal Decompression Therapy? Spinal Decompression Therapy is a non-surgical, non-chiropractic therapy to relieve back pain and other problems associated with spinal disc injuries. Spinal Decompression Therapy is an alternative FDA-approved treatment option that has shown to be effective and with long-lasting results. Who benefits from Spinal Decompression Therapy? Patients most likely to benefit from spinal decompression are individuals suffering from persistent pain in their backs and necks, often caused by the pinching or irritation of a spinal nerve by a spinal column disc. Spinal Decompression is used to treat conditions that result in chronic back pain such as bulging discs, herniated discs, degenerative disc disease, pinched nerves, spinal stenosis, sciatica, and arm pain or leg pain attributed to the spine asserting pressure on the discs. What are the causes of Low Back Pain? Low Back Pain can be caused by varying degrees of poor posture, bad body mechanics, repetitive stress, or acute trauma/injury. Any of these can cause your vertebrae to compress your discs or to slip out of alignment which then applies pressure to your nerves. What does Surgical Spinal Decompression look like? Surgical spinal decompression usually consists of removing the portion of the spinal column disc compressing the affected spinal nerve. Surgical spinal decompression should only be used as a last resort when all other forms of non-surgical alternative treatments have failed. Your doctor may suggest surgical spinal decompression for bulging or ruptured disks, bony growths, or other spinal problems. What is Non-Surgical Spinal Decompression Therapy? Simply stated, non surgical Spinal Decompression Therapy is non-invasive and provides gentle decompression of the disc through the use of a computerized traction device to gently pull on the targeted area of the spine (the compressed disc). The distraction force is applied in between periods of relaxation, causing the spinal column disc and nerves to realign properly. This treatment is applied over a series of visits and involves no medications or surgical procedures. What is the DRS Protocol for Pain? DRS stands for Decompression, Reduction and Stabilization. The DRS Protocol is a comprehensive combination of treatments, which include axial/spinal decompression and multiple therapies. The DRS Protocol has been proven most effective for chronic disc conditions: degenerative disc disease, herniated disc(s), numbness and tingling of the hands/arms and legs/feet, as well as sciatica, posterior facet syndrome, spinal stenosis and failed back and neck surgeries. During treatment, intradiscal pressure is dropped from a positive to a negative. This negative pressure promotes the diffusion, or intake, of water, oxygen, and nutrients into the vertebral disc area, thereby rehydrating the degenerated disc. Repeated pressure differential promotes retraction of a herniated nucleus pulposus (the elastic core of the intervertebral disc). Treatment is customized for each patient's needs, as each patient's health and condition is uniquely individual. Is the DRS Protocol Therapy uncomfortable or painful? No, the DRS Protocol is neither painful nor uncomfortable. For treatment for low back pain, the patient lies comfortably on his/her back on the decompression table, with a set of nicely padded straps snug around the waist and another set around the lower chest. For treatment of neck pain, the patient lies comfortably on his/her back with a pair of soft rubber pads behind the neck. Many patients enjoy the treatment, as it is usually quite comfortable and well tolerated, often bringing almost immediate relief from pain. The DRS Protocol treatment reduces pressure inside of the disc, which in turn reduces the painful herniation and pain from other disc-related degenerative conditions. The pressure reduction results in increased blood flow to the injured area, reduction of pain, increased mobility, and tissue repair. Are there any other options available for relief from Low Back Pain? In addition to, or alongside of Non-surgical Spine Decompression Therapy, other alternatives that we may recommend may include: - Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) - Physical therapy - Exercise - Limited rest - Steroid injections - Bracing - Chiropractic Before or after therapy, you may have other types of treatment, such as: - Electrical stimulation (electric current that causes certain muscles to contract) - Ultrasound (the use of sound waves to generate heat and promote healing) - Heat or cold therapy - Cold Laser What Are the Risks of Spinal Decompression Surgery? These are some of the more common risks associated with spinal decompression surgery: - Infection - Bleeding - Blood clots - Allergic reaction to anesthesia - Nerve or tissue damage A risk of surgery is that it may not improve back pain very much, as it can be difficult to determine who will benefit from spinal decompression surgery. How can I avoid injury or back pain? No one is immune to back injury. Whether you have a strong back or have hurt your back before, it is well worth it to: - Stop yourself before casually picking up a light or heavy load. - Plan in your mind for the best way to lift what's in front of you. This could include enlisting help from one or more people. - Lift and move slowly and carefully. The time you take to use the right lifting mechanics is far less than the days, weeks, or months it can take to heal from a back injury. What are the signs that you should see your Doctor for back pain? You should see a doctor for back pain if you have any of the following signs: - Numbness or tingling - Severe pain that does not improve with rest - Pain after a fall or an injury - Or pain plus fever, weakness, trouble urinating, numbness in your legs, and/or weight loss when not on a diet Who Should NOT Have Non-surgical Spinal Decompression? Not all patients suffering from pain due to compressed nerves are helped by non-surgical spinal decompression. Before starting treatments of any kind, you should have a thorough physical examination and a series of scans of the affected area, including x-rays and/or an MRI to determine if you are a candidate for nonsurgical spinal decompression treatment. People with any of the conditions listed below should NOT have non-surgical spinal decompression: - Fracture - Tumor - Abdominal aortic aneurysm - Advanced osteoporosis - Pregnant If you have more questions please contact one of our "}
