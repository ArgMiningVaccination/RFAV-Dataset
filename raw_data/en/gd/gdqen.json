Welcome to the Job! The office of magistrate has a history dating back to 12th Century England, when King Richard assigned knights the duty of keeping \"the King's peace.\" While the office of Justice of the Peace was a prestigious and honorable one for centuries, it was abolished in North Carolina in 1962 due to corruption, widespread lack of professionalism, and general dis repute. The old justice of the peace was replaced by the newlycreated office of magi strate, sharing many of the sam e responsibilities but lacking the factors that eventually led to the downfall of the justice of the peace. A Constitutional Office For each county, the senior regular reside nt Judge of the Superior Court serving the county shall appoint from nominations submitted by the Clerk of the Superior Court of the county, one or more Magistrates who sh all be officers of the District Court. The initial term of appointment for a magistra te shall be for two years and subsequent terms shall be for four years. The number of District Judges and Magistrates shall, from time to time, be determined by the Ge neral Assembly. . . . Vacancies in the office of Magistrate shall be filled for the un expired term in the manner provided for original appointment to the office, unl ess otherwise provided by the General Assembly. NC Constitution, Art. IV, Sec. 10. Qualifications (a) In order to be eligible for nomination or for renomination as a magistrate an individual shall be a resident of the county for which he is appointed. (b) To be eligible for nomination as a magistrate, an individual shall have at least eight years' experience as the clerk of superior court in a county of this St ate or shall have a four-year degree from an accredited senior instituti on of higher education or shall have a two-year associate degree and four years of work experience in a related field, including teaching, social services, law enforc ement, arbitration or mediation, the court system, or counseling. The Ad ministrative Officer of the Co urts may determine whether the work experience is sufficiently related to the duties of the office of magistrate for the purposes of this subsection. In determining wh ether an individual's work experience is in Welcome to the Job Page 1a related field, the Administrative Officer of the Courts shall c onsider the requisite knowledge, skills, and abilities fo r the office of magistrate. G.S. 7A171.2. Appointment The procedure established in the NC Constitution for appointmen t as a magistrate has been criticized as involving \"too many cooks.\" That proced ure is set out in G.S. 7A171(b) as follows: Not earlier than the Tuesday after the first Monday nor later than the third Monday in December of each evennumbered year, the clerk of the superior court shall submit to the senior regular resident superior court judge of the district or set of districts as defined in G. S. 7A41.1(a) in which the clerk's county is located the names of two (or more, if requested by the judge) nominees for each magisterial office for the county for which the term of office of the magistrate holding that position shall expire on December 31 of that year. Not late r than the fourth Monday in December, the senior regular resident superior court judge shall, from the nominations submitted by the clerk of the superior court, appoint magistrates to fill the positions for each county of the judge's district or set of districts. G.S. 7A171: Term of Office (a1)The initial term of appointment for a magistrate is two years and subsequent terms shall be for a period of four years. Th e term of office begins on the first day of January of the odd-numbered yea r after appointment. The service of an individual as a magistrate filling a vacancy as provided in subsection (d) of this section does not constitute an initial term. For purposes of this section, any term of office for a magistrate who has served a two-year term is for four years even if the two-year term of appointment was before the effective date of this section, the term is after a break in service, or the term is for appointment in a different county from the county where the two-year term of office was served. . . . (c) If an additional magisterial office for a county is approved to commence on January 1 of an odd-numbered year, the new pos ition shall be filled as provided in subsection (b) of this section. If the additional position takes effect at any other time, it is to be filled as provided in subsection (d) of this section. Welcome to the Job Page 2(d) [Upon] a vacancy in the offi ce of magistrate . . . the seni or regular resident superior court judge shall appoint from the nominatio ns received a magistrate who shall take office immediately and shall serve until December 31 of the even-numbered year, and thereafter the position shall be filled as prov ided in subsection (b ) of this section. Supervision chief district judge . . . has adminis trative supervision and authority over the operation of the district cour ts and magistrates in his di strict. These powers and duties include, but are not limite d to, the following: (4) Assigning matters to magistrates, and consistent with the salaries set by the Administrative Officer of the Courts, prescr ibing times and places at which magistrates shall be available for the performance of th eir duties; however, the chief district judge may in writing delegate his aut hority to prescribe times and places at which magistrates in a particular county shall be available for the performanc e of their duties to another district court judge or the clerk of the supe rior court, or the judge may appoint a chief magistrate to fulfill some or all of the duties. . . , and the person to whom such authority is delegated shall make monthly reports to the chief district judge of the times and places actually served by each magistrate. G.S. 7A-146. Note: Counties vary widely in procedures related to vacation l eave for magistrates. Training & Education Magistrates are required to satisfactorily complete Basic School in order to be eligible for reappointm ent. G.S. 7A171.2. In addition, magistrates are required to attend at least 12 hours of training approved by the AOC for continuing education credit each biennium. (A biennium begins on January 1st each oddnumbered year and ends on Decemb er 31 st of each evennumbered year.) Most opportunities for continuing education credit for magistra tes are offered by the AOC and the SOG. The AOC pro vides extensive training oppor tunities related to Welcome to the Job Page 3technology for magistrates; additional information and class sc hedules are available through the AOC intranet. In a ddition, the following regularly scheduled events are designed specifically to address magistrates' educational needs : Spring and Fall Conferences Jointly sponsored by the AOC, SO G, and the NC Magistrates' Asso ciation. Each conference provides a minimum of 12 hours of continuing educati on credit. Judicial College Seminars Consisting of 23 days of intensive smallgroup instruction, th ese seminars are offered on a recurring basis: Involuntary Commitment Introduction to Holding Small Claims Court Special Topics in Small Claims Law Advanced Criminal Procedure DWI Domestic Violence Course announcements and registration information are sent out to magistrates by email well in advance of each course. OneDay Regional Small Claims Seminars Conducted each fall in 3 locatio ns throughout the state. These seminars focus exclusively on small claims law and provide 6 hours of continui ng education credit. Criminal Law & More Conducted each fall in 3 locatio ns throughout the state. These seminars focus on criminal law and other topics of particular interest to magistr ates, and provide 6 hours of continuing education credit. Other Training Opportunities There are numerous other training opportunities for magistrates offered by a wide variety of providers. Note that training offered by providers other than AOC and SOG must be approved in advance for continuing education credit; students should carefully consult AOC policy, ava ilable on AOC intranet, concerning requirements for credit approval, and/or contact James Gray at AOC ( James.F.Gray@nccourts.org; 9198901110). Welcome to the Job Page 4Duties of the Office The duties a magistrate may be authorized to perform include th e following: Accept guilty pleas, admission o f responsibility and enter judgment for infractions Handle misdemeanor and infractio ns for cases involving alcohol, boating offenses, state park/recreationa l areas, littering offenses, an d wildlife offenses (e.g., hunting, fishing, etc.) Accept written appearances, waive rs of trial or hearing and gui lty pleas and, in appropriate cases, enter judgment and collect fines, penalties and costs Issue arrest warrants Issue search warrants Grant bail or set release conditions (noncapital offenses) Hear and enter judgments on worthless checks (<$2000.00) Conduct initial appearances Conduct small claims court in cases involving up to $10,000 Administer oaths Provide punishment for direct criminal contempt Take depositions and examination before trial Issue subpoenas and capiases Take affidavits for verification of pleadings Assign years allowances to surv iving spouses and children Perform marriage ceremonies Take acknowledgment of written contract or separation agreement Accept applications for i nvoluntary commitments Conduct hearing for driver license revocations Validate vehicle towin g by law enforcement Validate impounding of vehicles in certain DWI/DWLR charges Issue temporary domestic violenc e protection orders in certain emergency c o n d i t i o n s Appoint an umpire pursuant to GS 20279.21 to determine the amo unt of property damage to a motor vehicle Removal from Office The grounds for removing a magis trate from office are \"the same as . . . . \" G.S. 7A173(a). The grounds for removing a judge from office are: (1) willful misconduct in office, (2) willful and persistent failure to perform the judge's duties, Welcome to the Job Page 5(3) habitual intemperance, (4) conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, (5) conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. G.S. 7A376(b). While the grounds for removing a magistrate from office are ide ntical to those for removing a judge, the procedures are quite different. In the c ase of judges, complaints are considered by The Judicial Standards Commission, which in turn makes recommendations to the North Carolina Supreme Court, base d on a written ethical code enacted by that Cou rt termed the Code of Judicial Conduct. By contrast, neither the Commission nor the Sup reme Court is involved in considering complaints against magistrates, although the Code of Judicial Conduct itself has indirect application as a primary source of determining whether particular conduct is \"prejudicial to the administration of justice.\" The procedure for removing a mag istrate from office is set out in G.S. 7A173. The first step occurs when a sworn written complaint is filed with the clerk of superior court. The next step requires the chief district court judge t o examine the charges in order to determine whether the allegations, \"if true, constitute grounds for removal.\" The final step in the statutory process is a public hearing conducted by a superior court judge; upon findi ng that grounds for removal exist, the judge is required to remove the magistrate from office. Welcome to the Job Page 6Intro to Law & Judicial Process DGL/SOG/2019 FOR NEW MAGISTRATES: INTRODUCTION TO THE LAW AND THE NORTH CAROLINA COURT SYSTEM Some new magistrates begin their job knowing a great deal about the law and the court s, and others know nothing more than they've learned from watching \"Law and Order.\" Understanding some basic information and vocabulary will not only help you do your job, but it will also help you understand what people are talking about at the water fountain. (It helps to know A CC basketball really well, too.) WHERE DOES LAW COME FROM? The \"bedrock\" of the law is found in the U.S. and N.C. C onstitutions . For example, the principle that citizens are protected from the government performing unreasonable searches comes from the U. S. Constitution. Constitutional law often seems vague, because it state s a general principle that will apply in many different circumstances. HOW a constitutional principle should be applied in any particular case is a question for a court to decide. Whe n certain higher -level courts (called appellate courts) consider legal questions in the context of the particular facts of individual cases, their written decisions ( opinions ) are published and their decisions become law (called case law ). Example: the U.S. Supreme Court was faced with a case in which a police officer searched a suspect's house for evidence of a crime. He had no warrant for the search, but he DID have a good reason to think he would find the evidence there. Based on these facts, was the search \"unreasonable\" under the Constitution? The Court said that it was, explaining in its opinion some of the rules for deciding whether a warrant is required before a sea rch is conducted. The Court's decision , applying the Constitution to those particular facts, became law that would be applied to all similar cases in the future. But what if the facts were only somewhat similar? What if another policeman performed a warrantless search in similar circumstances, but this time the suspect's spouse consented to the search ? In that case, the Court found that a different rule applied, yielding a different result, and thus different law: a spouse who resides at the home may c onsent to the search of the premises, and that search is not \"unreasonable.\" Another important source of law is legislation passed by the General Assembly (or, in laws that apply to the entire country, by Congress) . These laws (called statutes) are (usual ly) clear statements of rules and consequences. For example, magistrate s have authority to punish people for direct criminal Intro to Law - Page 1DGL/SOG/2019 contempt because the General Assembly enacted a statute in 1965 giving them that authority. (N.C.G.S. 7A -292) Like the case involv ing unreasonable searches under the Constitution, sometimes the application of a statute to particular facts is not clear. In deciding on the language to use in a statute, the General Assembly can't possibly imagine all the situations in which its words m ight be applied. In those cases, as above, a court may have to interpret the statute in order to decide a case. For example, if a city ordinance prohibits walking on the grass in a particular area, and a person runs through the grass, has that person vio lated the law? While the statute seems clear, it may be necessary to ask a court to decide what \"walking\" means. Summing up: There are three sources of law : Constitutional law , case law, and statutory law. KINDS OF CASES (Almost) all cases that come befor e a court are either criminal or civil. This is a very important distinction, because a lot depends on whether a case is one or the other. In a civil case, one person has a complaint about the actions of another . In essence , s/he is saying, \"I have been harmed by the actions of this person.\" The person doing the complaining is called the plaintiff and the person being complained about is called the defendant . With only a few exceptions, the plaintiff is asking the court to ord er the defendant to pay money as compensation for the injury . Example: Kendra hits Kyle during an argument in a bar. Kyle may bring a civil lawsuit ( Kyle vs. Kendra ), in which he wil l try to prove (1) Kendra hit me, and (2 ) she should pay me $500 for my medical bills and pain and suffering. If Kendra responds by saying, \"I had a right to hit him, because he hit me first,\" she has presented a defense to Kyle's claim. In a civil case, the plaintiff must prove the case by the greater weight of the eviden ce. This means Kyle does not have to show enough proof to make the judge positive that what he says is right; he only needs enough proof to convince the judge that what he says is most likely right. In a civil case, the defendant usually has to pay money if she loses, but sometimes she will be ordered to do something instead, such as move out of her apartment or hand over her refri gerator to Sears after she misses a payment . Some examples of typical civil cases are breach of contract cases, cases arising out of automobile accidents, medical malpractice cases, cases involving divorce or other family law questions, and landlord -tenant cases. In a criminal case , the party doing the complaining is the State of North Carolina. You might have expected t he complainant to be the victim of the crime, and in fact a victim might sue a defendant in a civil lawsuit for the same behavior that the State is arguing is a crime. For example, if your bank teller puts your deposit in his pocket, he has committed a cr ime and the State may bring a criminal action against him. At the same time, you may bring a civil action, arguing (quite correctly) that his improper behavior caused you to suffer a loss for which he should be obligated to compensate you. . The State's i nterest is not so personal, however \u2014the State is concerned with more than your individual loss. The State is concerned that this is a person breaking very important rules designed to Intro to Law - Page 2DGL/SOG/2019 protect the public in general. By bringing criminal charges, the State is seeking to PUNISH the defendant, as well as to let other bank tellers know that they better not do the same thing. If the State decided to proceed criminally against Kendra in the example above, that case would be called State vs. Kendra , and Kyle , wh ile an important witness, would not be a party to the case. While people often think it is necessary to choose whether to proceed against a defendant criminally or civilly, that is not true . Because the interest of the victim is not at all the same as tha t of the State, a defendant may be called to account for her actions in both kinds of actions. O.J. Simpson, a famous example, was found not guilty of murder (a criminal charge), but was later found in a civil lawsuit to be responsible for the wrongful de aths of the two homicide victims. There are several important differences between civil and criminal cases, in addition to their different names. Most importantly, a defendant in a criminal case faces more than a loss of money: she may end up in jail. Because we believe that loss of freedom is much more serious than loss of money, special rules apply. For one thing, the burden of proof is much higher. To send Kendra to jail for hitting Kyle , the State will have to prove its case beyond a reasonable do ubt. For another thing, the U.S. Constitution gives criminal defend ants some special protections: A criminal defend ant is entitled to an attorney even if unable to pay for one . A criminal defendant has a legal right to refuse to answer questions that migh t reveal incriminating evidence . In criminal cases, a jury trial is available upon request. Finally, the defendant is entitled to face and question the witnesses at trial . These special protections are designed to make it hard for an innocent man or woma n to be sent to jail; it is sometimes said that it is better for 100 guilty people to go free than for one innocent person to be imprisoned. There are three kinds of offenses against the State (or The People) in North Carolina. Most serious are felonies , involving crimes such as rape, murder, and theft of valuable property. Less serious are misdemeanors , involving crimes such as shoplifting, worthless checks, and simple assa ult. Least serious\u2014and technically not crime s at all\u2014are infractions , involving offenses such as speeding and failure to have your vehicle inspected. THE COURT SYSTEM The court system is somewhat like a factory, in that it has many different parts, workin g together but each responsible for doing a particular job . ADMINISTRATION AND RECORD -KEEPING. The Clerk of Superior Court is the business office of the court system, charged with keeping accura te records and handling money. The Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) is management: it administers the business of the courts, including personnel matters and a host of other responsibilities required to keep the courts operational, efficient, fair, and effective. Intro to Law - Page 3DGL/SOG/2019 TRIAL COURTS The trial courts are divided into the district court division and the superior court division. Cases handled in the district court division may be heard by a magistrate or by a district court judge, depending on the type of case. Magistrates have a number of duties, including issuing search warrants, setting conditions of pretrial release, and taking guilty pleas in certain small criminal cases. Magistrates also hear ci vil cases involving less than $10, 000 in small claims court. District court judges hear appeals fro m small claims court. The district court is also the proper court for civ il cases involving less than $25 ,000, misdemeanor criminal cases, family law and juvenile cases, and involuntary commitments. Cases handled in the superior court division may be heard by a superior court clerk or a superior court judge, depending on the type of case. The clerk of superior court is responsible for hearing cases involving probate, adoptions, foreclosures, and guardianship, among others. Superior court judges are respo nsible for trying felony criminal cases, misdemeanor criminal cases appealed from district court, civil cases involving more than $ 25,000, and appeals from cases decided by the clerk. Both district attorney s (also called prosecutors ) and public defenders work only on criminal cases. The DA represents the State, while the PD represents criminal defendants who cannot afford t o hire a private attorney. The district and superior courts together make up the trial divisions of North Carolina's judicia l system. These courts conduct trials , meaning they hear witnesses, determine important facts, and hand down legally binding decisions called judgments . But what happens if a judge makes a mistake? Appellate Courts Appellate courts have one purpose, and one purpose only: to determine whether the trial judge in a particular case has done his or her job correctly. An appellate court does not hear witnesses, and it does not decide the facts of a case. Instead, it examines the officia l record of the case fo r legal errors. For example, a landlord -tenant case might involve a tenant who asks that the landlord be ordered to reimburse him for padlocking the rental property in which he lives without first going through the eviction procedur e. If a trial judge dismissed this case, based on a ruling that a landlord is entitled to terminate a residential tenancy by merely locking the premises, the tenant might appeal the case. If he did, the appellate court would almost certainly say that the trial judge made an error in law: in fact, self-help eviction such as this is prohibited in residential rentals. The appellate court would write an opinion explaining the law so that other judges could avoid making the same mistake in other Intro to Law - Page 4DGL/SOG/2019 cases in the future, and it would direct the trial judge to correct the error in the particular case that had been appeal ed. In North Carolina, there are two appellate courts: the North Carolina Court of Appeals (fifteen judges who consider cases in a \"panel\" of three judges for each case) and the North Carolina Supreme Court (seven \"justices\" who all consider and vote on each case) . In cases in which the Court of Appeals cannot agree on the law, and in some other cases of great importance (for example, death penalty cases) , the North Carolina Supreme Court makes the final decision. THE COURT SYSTEM'S PUBLIC FACE: THE MAGISTRATE For most citizens, the first member of the court system they encounter is a magistrate, and in many cases, the magistrate is the ONLY court official they interact with. North Carolina's more than 600 magistrates hold an office that dates back to 1195, whe n King Richard the Lionhearted appointed certain knights to serve as \"Keepers of the Peace,\" the forerunner of the Justice of the Peace. In 1970, North Carolina modified i ts court system and moved from justices of the peace to magistrates , but the office remained in many ways the same. Nominated by the Clerk of Superior Court, appointed by the Resident Superior Court Judge, and supervised by the Chief District Court Judge, it is somewhat ironic that the magistrate \u2014with so many conceivable bosses \u2014is actual ly an independent judicial official, removable from office only for serious reasons found to exist in an official removal procedure established by statute.

Statutes Are laws passed by a legislative body Congress enacts federal statutes Local governing bodies pass ordinances. The NC General Assembly enacts state statutes o NC statutes are organized into chapters which are in turn organized into articles, sections, and subsections. o A citation to a NC statute may begin with NCGS, N C Gen Stat, or simply GS, followed by a number\u2014indicating the chapter \u2014a hyphen, and another number\u2014 indicating the section. EXAMPLES: The statutes of limitation for most civil actions may be found in GS Ch. 1, Art. 5. Intro to Law - Page 7DGL/SOG/2018 The qualifications for appointment as a magistrate are set out in NC Gen Stat. 7A-171.2. o Statutes are available online at https://www.ncleg.net/gascripts/statutes/statutes.asp (or j ust Google \"NC statutes\" and click the first link). Statutes must be read carefully, giving every word its pr e cise meaning. When a statute's meaning is not clear, there are legal rules about statutory construction , i.e., interpreting the meaning of the statute. Appellate Court Opinions (aka Case Law ) Written opinions provided by panels of appellate court judg es reviewing trials in individual cases. Appellate courts do not hear evidence or conduct trials. In stead they review the record of a trial to determine whether the trial judge made an error. Reading an appellate opinion requires a different approach than reading a statute. The part of the opinion essential to the result reached b y the Court is a holding. The Court's holding in an appellate case is binding on lower courts in future cases. Language in the opinion not essential to the result is dicta. Dicta in an opinion, however intriguing and suggestive, is not binding on lower courts and may be ignored in future opinions of the deciding court. NC has two appellate courts, the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court, with the former being the intermediate court and the latter being - well-- Supreme. Case names are in the form of Plaintiff v. Defendant, XX NC App (or NC) YYY (year of decision). Examples: Friday v. United Dominion Realty, Inc., 155 N.C. App. 671 (2003). State v. Knoll , 422 N.C. 535 (1988). If you are interested in reading court opinions as they're handed down, you can go to www.nccourts.org and click on \"opinions\" in the column on the right. If you're VERY eager, you can sign up there to be notified of new cases as soon as they're filed. If you're looking for a case and have only the name or what it's about, sometimes GOOGLE is your best bet. Example: Intro to Law - Page 8DGL/SOG/2018 Facts: LL-T case involving dispute over late fees assessed but unpaid in residential lease providing for monthly rent of $600. Late fees were calculated by computer and filled in automatically in written lease agreement. Computer rounded up to whole dollars, providing that late fee in amount of $31 would be assessed. LL never charged this amount, instead assessing $30. Statute: Case \"We hold that although Northwinds only charged and Ms. Frida y only paid a $30 late fee each time her rent was late, the $31 late fee provision of the Northwinds lease agreement is contrary to the provisions of G.S. \u00a7 42-46(a) and therefore void and unenforceable as against North Carolina public policy.\" What is the rule of law? There can be no free society without law administered throu gh an independent judiciary. If one man can be allowed to determine for himself what is law, every man can. That means first chaos, then tyranny. \u2014U.S. Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter (1947). From the very beginning, our state and national constitution s and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials before impartial Intro to Law - Page 9DGL/SOG/2018 tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the law. This noble ideal cannot be realized if the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers without a lawyer to assist him. \u2014U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black (1963) [N]either laws nor the procedures used to create or imple m ent them should be secret; and . . . the laws must not be arbitrary. \u2014U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Diane Wood (2003) When we [Americans] talk about the rule of law, we assume that we're talking about a law that promotes freedom, that promotes justice, that promotes equality. \u2014U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy (2007) Some people have said it boils down to four components: 1. __________________________________________________________ Due Process: The Heart of Your Job Put th is in your own words: ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________ No State shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.

Kerr This essay is designed to help new law students prepare for the first few weeks of class. It explains what judicial opinions are, how they are structured, and what law students should look for when reading them. I./g561W HAT'S/g561IN/g561A/g561LEGAL /g561OPINION ?/g561 hen two people disagree and that disagreement leads to a lawsuit, the lawsuit will sometimes end with a ruling by a judge in favor of one side. The judge will explain the ruling in a written document referred to as an \"opinion.\" The opinion explains what the case is about, discusses the relevant legal principles, and then applies the law to the facts to reach a ruling in favor of one side and against the other. Modern judicial opinions reflect hundreds of years of history and practice. They usually follow a simple and predictable formula.

It starts with the intro- ductory materials at the top of an opinion and then moves on to the body of the opinion. The/g561Caption/g561 The first part of the case is the title of the case, known as the \"cap-tion.\" Examples include Brown v. Board of Education and Miranda v. Arizona. The caption usually tells you the last names of the person who brought the lawsuit and the person who is being sued. These two sides are often referred to as the \"parties\" or as the \"litigants\" in the case. For example, if Ms. Smith sues Mr. Jones, the case caption may be Smith v. Jones (or, depending on the court, Jones v. Smith ). In criminal law, cases are brought by government prosecutors on behalf of the government itself. This means that the government is the named party. For example, if the federal government charges John Doe with a crime, the case caption will be United States v. Doe . If a state brings the charges instead, the caption will be State v. Doe, People v. Doe , or Commonwealth v. Doe , depending on the practices of that state. 1 The/g561Case/g561Citation/g561 Below the case name you will find some letters and numbers. These letters and numbers are the legal citation for the case. A citation tells you the name of the court that decided the case, the law book in which the opinion was published, and the year in which the court decided the case. For example, \"U.S. Supreme Court, 485 U.S. 759 (1988)\" refers to a U.S. Supreme Court case decided in 1988 that appears in Volume 485 of the United States Reports starting at page 759. The/g561Author/g561of/g561the/g561Opinion/g561 The next information is the name of the judge who wrote the opin-ion. Most opinions assigned in law school were issued by courts 1 English criminal cases normally will be Rex v. Doe or Regina v. Doe. Rex and Regina aren't the victims: the words are Latin for \"King\" and \"Queen.\" During the reign of a King, English courts use \"Rex\"; during the reign of a Queen, they switch to \"Regina.\" Intro to Law - Page 16How/g561to/g561Read/g561a/g561Legal/g561Opinion/g561 AUTUMN /g5612007/g561 53/g561with multiple judges. The name tells you which judge wrote that particular opinion. In older cases, the opinion often simply states a last name followed by the initial \"J.\" No, judges don't all have the first initial \"J.\" The letter stands for \"Judge\" or \"Justice,\" depending on the court. On occasion, the opinion will use the Latin phrase \"per curiam\" instead of a judge's name. Per curiam means \"by the court.\" It signals that the opinion reflects a common view among all the judges rather than the writings of a specific judge. The/g561Facts/g561of/g561the/g561Case/g561 Now let's move on to the opinion itself. The first part of the body of the opinion presents the facts of the case. In other words, what happened? The facts might be that Andy pulled out a gun and shot Bob. Or maybe Fred agreed to give Sally $100 and then changed his mind. Surprisingly, there are no particular rules for what facts a judge must include in the fact section of an opinion. Sometimes the fact sections are long, and sometimes they are short. Sometimes they are clear and accurate, and other times they are vague or in- complete. Most discussions of the facts also cover the \"procedural history\" of the case. The procedural history explains how the legal dispute worked its way through the legal system to the court that is issuing the opinion. It will include various motions, hearings, and trials that occurred after the case was initially filed. Your civil procedure class is all about that kind of stuff; you should pay very close attention to the procedural history of cases when you read assignments for your civil procedure class. The procedural history of cases usually will be less important when you read a case for your other classes. The/g561Law/g561of/g561the/g561Case/g561 After the opinion presents the facts, it will then discuss the law. Many opinions present the law in two stages. The first stage dis-cusses the general principles of law that are relevant to cases such as the one the court is deciding. This section might explore the history of a particular field of law or may include a discussion of past cases (known as \"precedents\") that are related to the case the court is de- Intro to Law - Page 17Orin/g561S./g561Kerr/g561 54/g561 11/g561G REEN /g561BAG/g5612D/g561ciding. This part of the opinion gives the reader background to help understand the context and significance of the court's decision. The second stage of the legal section applies the general legal principles to the particular facts of the dispute. As you might guess, this part is in many ways the heart of the opinion: It gets to the bottom line of why the court is ruling for one side and against the other. Concurring/g561and/or/g561Dissenting/g561Opinions/g561 Most of the opinions you read as a law student are \"majority\" opin-ions. When a group of judges get together to decide a case, they vote on which side should win and also try to agree on a legal ra-tionale to explain why that side has won. A majority opinion is an opinion joined by the majority of judges on that court. Although most decisions are unanimous, some cases are not. Some judges may disagree and will write a separate opinion offering a different approach. Those opinions are called \"concurring opinions\" or \"dis-senting opinions,\" and they appear after the majority opinion. A \"concurring opinion\" (sometimes just called a \"concurrence\") ex- plains a vote in favor of the winning side but based on a different legal rationale. A \"dissenting opinion\" (sometimes just called a \"dis-sent\") explains a vote in favor of the losing OMMON /g561LEGAL /g561TERMS /g561 FOUND /g561IN/g561OPINIONS /g561 ow that you know what's in a legal opinion, it's time to learn some of the common words you'll find inside them. But first a history lesson, for reasons that should be clear in a minute. In 1066, William the Conqueror came across the English Chan- nel from what is now France and conquered the land that is today called England. The conquering Normans spoke French and the de- feated Saxons spoke Old English. The Normans took over the court system, and their language became the language of the law. For sev-eral centuries after the French-speaking Normans took over Eng-land, lawyers and judges in English courts spoke in French. When English courts eventually returned to using English, they continued to use many French words. N Intro to Law - Page 18How/g561to/g561Read/g561a/g561Legal/g561Opinion/g561 AUTUMN /g5612007/g561 55/g561Why should you care about this ancient history? The American colonists considered themselves Englishmen, so they used the Eng- lish legal system and adopted its language. This means that Ameri-can legal opinions today are littered with weird French terms. Ex- amples include plaintiff, defendant, tort, contract, crime, judge, attorney, counsel, court, verdict, party, appeal, evidence, and jury. These words are the everyday language of the American legal sys-tem. And they're all from the French, brought to you by William the Conqueror in 1066. This means that when you read a legal opinion, you'll come across a lot of foreign-sounding words to describe the court system. You need to learn all of these words eventually; you should read cases with a legal dictionary nearby and should look up every word you don't know. But this section will give you a head start by intro- ducing you to some of the most common words, many of which (but not all) are French in origin. Types/g561of/g561Disputes/g561and/g561the/g561Names/g561of/g561Participants/g561 There are two basic kinds of legal disputes: civil and criminal. In a civil case, one person files a lawsuit against another asking the court to order the other side to pay him money or to do or stop doing something. An award of money is called \"damages\" and an order to do something or to refrain from doing something is called an \"in- junction.\" The person bringing the lawsuit is known as the \"plaintiff\" and the person sued is called the \"defendant.\" In criminal cases, there is no plaintiff and no lawsuit. The role of a plaintiff is occupied by a government prosecutor. Instead of filing a lawsuit (or equivalently, \"suing\" someone), the prosecutor files criminal \"charges.\" Instead of asking for damages or an injunction, the prosecutor asks the court to punish the individual through either jail time or a fine. The government prosecutor is often referred to as \"the state,\" \"the prosecution,\" or simply \"the government.\" The person charged is called the defendant, just like the person sued in a civil case. In legal disputes, each party ordinarily is represented by a law- yer. Legal opinions use several different words for lawyers, includ- Intro to Law \"attorney\" and \"counsel.\" There are some historical differences among these terms, but for the last century or so they have all meant the same thing. When a lawyer addresses a judge in court, she will always address the judge as \"your honor,\" just like lawyers do in the movies. In legal opinions, however, judges will usually refer to themselves as \"the Court.\" Terms/g561in/g561Appellate/g561Litigation/g561 Most opinions that you read in law school are appellate opinions, which means that they decide the outcome of appeals. An \"appeal\" is a legal proceeding that considers whether another court's legal deci-sion was right or wrong. After a court has ruled for one side, the losing side may seek review of that decision by filing an appeal be- fore a higher court. The original court is usually known as the trial court, because that's where the trial occurs if there is one. The higher court is known as the appellate or appeals court, as it is the court that hears the appeal. A single judge presides over trial court proceedings, but appel- late cases are decided by panels of several judges. For example, in the federal court system, run by the United States government, a single trial judge known as a District Court judge oversees the trial stage. Cases can be appealed to the next higher court, the Court of Appeals, where cases are decided by panels of three judges known as Circuit Court judges. A side that loses before the Circuit Court can seek review of that decision at the United States Supreme Court. Supreme Court cases are decided by all nine judges. Su-preme Court judges are called Justices instead of judges; there is one \"Chief Justice\" and the other eight are just plain \"Justices\" (technically they are \"Associate Justices,\" but everyone just calls them \"Justices\"). During the proceedings before the higher court, the party that lost at the original court and is therefore filing the appeal is usually known as the \"appellant.\" The party that won in the lower court and must defend the lower court's decision is known as the \"appellee\" (accent on the last syllable). Some older opinions may refer to the appellant as the \"plaintiff in error\" and the appellee as the \"defendant Law - Page 20How/g561to/g561Read/g561a/g561Legal/g561Opinion/g561 AUTUMN /g5612007/g561 57/g561in error.\" Finally, some courts label an appeal as a \"petition,\" and require the losing party to petition the higher court for relief. In these cases, the party that lost before the lower court and is filing the petition for review is called the \"petitioner.\" The party that won before the lower court and is responding to the petition in the higher court is called the \"respondent.\" Confused yet? You probably are, but don't worry. You'll read so many cases in the next few weeks that you'll get used to all of this very soon. III./g561W HAT/g561YOU/g561NEED/g561TO/g561LEARN /g561FROM /g561 READING /g561A/g561CASE/g561 kay, so you've just read a case for class. You think you under-stand it, but you're not sure if you learned what your profes- sor wanted you to learn. Here is what professors want students to know after reading a case assigned for class: Know/g561the/g561Facts/g561 Law professors love the facts. When they call on students in class, they typically begin by asking students to state the facts of a particu-lar case. Facts are important because law is often highly fact-sensitive, which is a fancy way of saying that the proper legal out- come depends on the exact details of what happened. If you don't know the facts, you can't really understand the case and can't un-derstand the law. Most law students don't appreciate the importance of the facts when they read a case. Students think, \"I'm in law school, not fact school; I want to know what the law is, not just what happened in this one case.\" But trust me: the facts are really important. 2 2 If you don't believe me, you should take a look at a few law school exams. It turns out that the most common form of law school exam question presents a long description of a very particular set of facts. It then asks the student to \"spot\" and analyze the legal issues presented by those facts. These exam questions are known as \"issue-spotters,\" as they test the student's ability to understand the facts and spot the legal issues they raise. As you might imagine, doing well on an issue-O Intro to Law - Page 21Orin/g561S./g561Kerr/g561 58/g561 11/g561G REEN /g561BAG/g5612D/g561Know/g561the/g561Specific/g561Legal/g561Arguments/g561Made/g561by/g561the/g561Parties/g561 Lawsuits are disputes, and judges only issue opinions when two par- ties to a dispute disagree on a particular legal question. This means that legal opinions focus on resolving the parties' very specific dis- agreement. The lawyers, not the judges, take the lead role in fram- ing the issues raised by a case. In an appeal, for example, the lawyer for the appellant will ar- ticulate specific ways in which the lower court was wrong. The ap-pellate court will then look at those arguments and either agree or disagree. (Now you can understand why people pay big bucks for top lawyers; the best lawyers are highly skilled at identifying and articulating their arguments to the court.) Because the lawyers take the lead role in framing the issues, you need to understand exactly what arguments the two sides were making. Know/g561the/g561Disposition/g561 The \"disposition\" of a case is the action the court took. It is often announced at the very end of the opinion. For example, an appeals court might \"affirm\" a lower court decision, upholding it, or it might \"reverse\" the decision, ruling for the other side. Alterna- tively, an appeals court might \"vacate\" the lower court decision, wiping the lower-court decision off the books, and then \"remand\" the case, sending it back to the lower court for further proceedings. For now, you should keep in mind that when a higher court \"af-firms\" it means that the lower court had it right (in result, if not in reasoning). Words like \"reverse,\" \"remand,\" and \"vacate\" means that the higher court though the lower court had it wrong. Understand/g561the/g561Reasoning/g561of/g561the/g561Majority/g561Opinion/g561 To understand the reasoning of an op inion, you should first identify the source of the law the judge applied. Some opinions interpret the Constitution, the founding charter of the government. Other cases spotter requires developing a careful and nuanced understanding of the impor- tance of the facts. The best way to prepare for that is to read the fact sections of your cases very carefully. Intro to Law - Page 22How/g561to/g561Read/g561a/g561Legal/g561Opinion/g561 AUTUMN /g5612007/g561 59/g561interpret \"statutes,\" which is a fancy name for written laws passed by legislative bodies such as Congress. Still other cases interpret \"the common law,\" which is a term that usually refers to the body of prior case decisions that derive ultimately from pre-1776 English law that the Colonists brought over from England. 3 In your first year, the opinions that you read in your Torts, Con- tracts, and Property classes will mostly interpret the common law. Opinions in Criminal Law mostly interpret either the common law or statutes. Finally, opinions in your Civil Procedure casebook will mostly interpret statutory law or the Constitution. The source of law is very important because American law follows a clear hierar-chy. Constitutional rules trump statutory (statute-based) rules, and statutory rules trump common law rules. After you have identified the source of law, you should next identify the method of reasoning that the court used to justify its decision. When a case is governed by a statute, for example, the court usually will simply follow what the statute says. The court's role is narrow in such settings because the legislature has settled the law. Similarly, when past courts have already answered similar questions before, a court may conclude that it is required to reach a particular result because it is bound by the past precedents. This is an application of the judicial practice of \"stare decisis,\" an abbrevia-tion of a Latin phrase meaning \"That which has been already decided should remain settled.\" In other settings, courts may justify their decisions on public pol- icy grounds. That is, they may pick the rule that they think is the best rule, and they may explain in the opinion why they think that rule is best. This is particularly likely in common law cases where judges are not bound by a statute or constitutional rule. Other courts will rely on morality, fairness, or notions of justice to justify 3 The phrase \"common law\" started being used about a thousand years ago to refer to laws that were common to all English citizens. Thus, the word \"common\" in the phrase \"common law\" means common in the sense of \"shared by all,\" not common in the sense of \"not very special.\" The \"common law\" was announced in judicial opinions. As a result, you will sometimes hear the phrase \"common law\" used to refer to areas of judge-made law as opposed to legislatively-made law. Intro to Law - Page 23Orin/g561S./g561Kerr/g561 60/g561 11/g561G REEN /g561BAG/g5612D/g561their decisions. Many courts will mix and match, relying on several or even all of these justifications. Understand/g561the/g561Significance/g561of/g561the/g561Majority/g561Opinion/g561 Some opinions resolve the parties' legal dispute by announcing and applying a clear rule of law that is new to that particular case. That rule is known as the \"holding\" of the case. Holdings are often con- trasted with \"dicta\" found in an opinion. Dicta refers to legal state- ments in the opinion not needed to resolve the dispute of the par-ties; the word is a pluralized abbreviation of the Latin phrase \"obiter dictum,\" which means \"a remark by the way.\" When a court announces a clear holding, you should take a min- ute to think about how the court's rule would apply in other situa-tions. During class, professors like to pose \"hypotheticals,\" new sets of facts that are different from those found in the cases you have read. They do this for two reasons. First, it's hard to understand the significance of a legal rule unless you think about how it might apply to lots of different situations. A rule might look good in one setting, but another set of facts might reveal a major problem or ambiguity. Second, judges often reason by \"analogy,\" which means a new case may be governed by an older case when the facts of the new case are similar to those of the older one. This raises the question, which are the legally relevant facts for this particular rule? The best way to evaluate this is to consider new sets of facts. You'll spend a lot of time doing this in class, and you can get a head start on your class discussions by asking the hypotheticals on your own before class begins. Finally, you should accept that some opinions are vague. Some- times a court won't explain its reasoning very well, and that forces us to try to figure out what the opinion means. You'll look for the holding of the case but become frustrated because you can't find one. It's not your fault; some opinions are written in a narrow way so that there is no clear holding, and others are just poorly reasoned or written. Rather than trying to fill in the ambiguity with false cer-tainty, try embracing the ambiguity instead. One of the skills of top-flight lawyers is that they know what they don't know: they know Intro to Law - Page 24How/g561to/g561Read/g561a/g561Legal/g561Opinion/g561 AUTUMN /g5612007/g561 61/g561when the law is unclear. Indeed, this skill of identifying when a problem is easy and when it is hard (in the sense of being unsettled or unresolved by the courts) is one of the keys to doing very well in law school. The best law students are the ones who recognize and identify these unsettled issues without pretending that they are easy. Understand/g561Any/g561Concurring/g561and/or/g561Dissenting/g561Opinions/g561 You probably won't believe me at first, but concurrences and dis- sents are very important. You need to read them carefully. To un-derstand why, you need to appreciate that law is man-made, and Anglo-American law has often been judge-made. Learning to \"think like a lawyer\" often means learning to think like a judge, which means learning how to evaluate which rules and explanations are strong and which are weak. Courts occasionally say things that are silly, wrongheaded, or confused, and you need to think independ-ently about what judges say. Concurring and dissenting opinions often do this work for you. Casebook authors edit out any unimportant concurrences and dis-sents to keep the opinions short. When concurrences and dissents appear in a casebook, it signals that they offer some valuable insights and raise important arguments. Disagreement between the majority opinion and concurring or dissenting opinions often frames the key issue raised by the case; to understand the case, you need to under- stand the arguments offered in concurring and dissenting opinions. IV./g561W HY/g561DO/g561LAW/g561PROFESSORS /g561 USE/g561THE/g561CASE/g561METHOD ?/g561 'll conclude by stepping back and explaining why law professors bother with the case method. Every law student quickly realizes that law school classes are very different from college classes. Your college professors probably stood at the podium and droned on while you sat back in your chair, safe in your cocoon. You're now starting law school, and it's very different. You're reading about actual cases, real-life disputes, and you're trying to learn about the law by picking up bits and pieces of it from what the opinions tell I Intro to Law - Page 25Orin/g561S./g561Kerr/g561 62/g561 11/g561G REEN /g561BAG/g5612D/g561you. Even weirder, your professors are asking you questions about those opinions, getting everyone to join in a discussion about them. Why the difference?, you may be wondering. Why do law schools use the case method at all? I think there are two major reasons, one historical and the other practical. The/g561Historical/g561Reason/g561 The legal system that we have inherited from England is largely judge-focused. The judges have made the law what it is through their written opinions. To understand that law, we need to study the actual decisions that the judges have written. Further, we need to learn to look at law the way that judges look at law. In our sys- tem of government, judges can only announce the law when decid-ing real disputes: they can't just have a press conference and an-nounce a set of legal rules. (This is sometimes referred to as the \"case or controversy\" requirement; a court has no power to decide an issue unless it is presented by an actual case or controversy be- fore the court.) To look at the law the way that judges do, we need to study actual cases and controversies, just like the judges. In short, we study real cases and disputes because real cases and disputes his-torically have been the primary source of law. The/g561Practical/g561Reason/g561 A second reason professors use the case method is that it teaches an essential skill for practicing lawyers. Lawyers represent clients, and clients will want to know how laws apply to them. To advise a cli-ent, a lawyer needs to understand exactly how an abstract rule of law will apply to the very specific situations a client might encoun-ter. This is more difficult than you might think, in part because a legal rule that sounds definite and clear in the abstract may prove murky in application. (For example, imagine you go to a public park and see a sign that says \"No vehicles in the park.\" That plainly for-bids an automobile, but what about bicycles, wheelchairs, toy automobiles? What about airplanes? Ambulances? Are these \"vehi- cles\" for the purpose of the rule or not?) As a result, good lawyers Intro to Law - Page 26How/g561to/g561Read/g561a/g561Legal/g561Opinion/g561 AUTUMN /g5612007/g561 63/g561need a vivid imagination; they need to imagine how rules might ap- ply, where they might be unclear, and where they might lead to unexpected outcomes. The case method and the frequent use of hypotheticals will help train your brain to think this way. Learning the law in light of concrete situations will help you deal with par- ticular facts you'll encounter as a practicing lawyer. Good luck!

What is the principal relief sought? Summary Ejectment Money Owed Return of Personal Property Not Coercive Judgment Not Action to Recover Real Property In case of a claim for $$ or personal property, what is amount in controversy? Maximum $10,000 Does at least one reside in your county? Q: What should the mag istrate do if a case does not meet one of these requirements? A: The magistrate should not hear the case. If the case isn't the type that may be heard in small claims: dismiss. If the amount in controversy too high: may be cured in some cases by amending complaint. Otherwise, di smiss or return to clerk. isn't a resident: dismiss or return to clerk Mandatory Rule #1: You must have subject matter jurisdiction. Amount in Controversy Rules ~ Amount in controversy is determined as of time case is filed. ~ Claimsplitting is not allowed. ~ In actions for return of personal property, amount in controversy is FMV. ~ In summary ejectment actions in which seeks only possession, amount in controversy requirement does not apply. Small Claims - Page 7 plaintiff defendant P a g e 2 Q: Where does a corporation \"reside\"? A: Corporations that have authority to do business in NC reside in either the county in which the principal office is located or the county in which the corporation maintains a place of business. If neither of these applies to a particular corporation, it resides in any county in which it is regularly conducting business. G.S. 179. Q: What if has sued more than one , but only one resides in the county? A: The law requires only that at least one reside in the county. HAS BEEN SERVED ? Check the file for one of the following: Completed return of service on back of summons 's affidavit & postal receipt 's written acceptance of service has filed motion, answer, or counterclaim OR is present in court Q: What should the magistrate do if the summons and compla int have not been served? A: Continue the case to allow additional time for service. Use AOC Form G108. Q: What if has sued more than one , but only one has been served? A: must choose between requesting continuance to pursue service on other s, or taking a vol untary dismissal against unserved s and going ahead against that has been served. Mandatory Rule #2: You must have jurisdiction over the : either service of process or voluntary appearance. Small Claims - Page 8 plaintiff defendant P a g e 3 Hint: Be careful not to confuse service of process with the rule about at least one residing in the county . They are two separate requirements. HAVE ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS BEEN FILED WITH THE CLERK ? Check the file for: an answer (which may also contain a counterclaim) a motion for continuance a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim [Rule 12(b)(6)] lack of personal jurisdiction improper venue Q: What difference does it make if files an answer? A: It makes very little difference. Quite often, answers are filed in cases in which is represented by an attorney unused to small claims practice who are unaware that answers are not required in small claims court. Filing an answer in a case does constitute a voluntary appearance, though, and so it may be important in an action in which has not been served and is not present in court. Q: How should I handle a pretrial motion for a continuance? A: The law favors, but does not require, granting a continuance if both parties join in the request. If a request for a continuance is made by only one party, the law requires that party to demonstrate good cause. If the magistrate grants a continuance, s/he must be certain that the other party receives Service on a Corporate : Delivering to registered agent, or Serving officer, director, or managing agent by Delivering copy Leaving copy in office with person apparently in charge Mailing or using delivery service (certified, signed receipt) Small Claims - Page 9 plaintiff defendant P a g e 4 notice of the new trial date and time. In summary ejectment actions, a continuance is permitted only for good cause and for a maximum of 5 business days unless both parties agree to a longer period. Q: What should I do if files a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim for relief? A: This motion is not allowed in small claims court. GS 7A216. Because it is a common motion in general civil actions, this error is usually made by an attorney unused to small claims practice and unfamiliar with the rules of small claims procedure set out in GS Ch. 7A, Art. 19. A magistrate should either instruct the attorney to withdraw the motion or deny it as improperly made. Q: What if the motion is actually valid in the sense that the complaint is virtually blank or so poorlystated that it in fact does fail to adequately notify of the underlying basis for the lawsuit sufficient to permit to identify potential defenses? A: GS 7A216 authorizes the magistrate to direct the to amend the complaint to provide adequate details, and to grant whatever continuances may be necessary to allow to respond to the new information. Q: What should I do if files a motion to dismiss pursuant to GS 1A1, Rule 12(b)(2) and/or (3), challenging venue or personal jurisdiction? A: GS 7A221 provides that assignment to the magistrate is automatically suspended if a files one of these motions. The clerk must schedule the motion for hearing before a district court judge. NOTE: Thes e objections are waived unless filed in writing prior to trial. A who objects to personal jurisdiction or venue for the first time at trial will not be heard, unless the defect is so severe as to deprive the court of total authority to hear the case. E.g., the LOCAL PRACTICE ALERT : Be sure to find out what your county's policy is about the procedure for pretrial requests for a continuance. Small Claims - Page 10 plaintiff defendant P a g e 5 complaint and summons clearly states that is not a resident of the county, thus depriving the small claims court of subject matter jurisdiction. BEFORE YOU HEAR THE EVIDENCE Complete the PreTrial Checklist Determine whether both parties, or their authorized representatives , are present. Who is an authorized representative? The party's attorney SE cases: with personal knowledge An agent Corporate party: officer or employee Special cases: estates, guardians (ad litem & otherwise) Who is NOT an authorized representative? Anyone having only power of attorney If neither party is present, or only is present : Dismiss the case for failure to prosecute , using AOCG108. Q: If appears and does not appear, is it appropriate to continue the case to allow the another chance to appear? A: No. Q: In this situation, should I mark my dismissal as with or without prejudice ? A: If asks you to dismiss the action, dismissal with prejudice is appropriate unless some special circumstances dictate a different result. Mandatory Rule #3: A party may appear only pro se (on his own behalf) or through an attorney unless an exception applies. Small Claims - Page 11 plaintiff defendant P a g e 6 Q: What do these terms actually mean? A: When a case is dismissed without prejudice , the may refile the same lawsuit. Unless barred by a statute of limitations, the only consequence to the for failing to appear is paying court costs when the files again. When a case is dismissed with prejudice , it is a final determination that is not liable for the particular fault alleged in the lawsuit. If attempts to bring a second lawsuit against the same for the same reason, is entitled to have the second case dismissed. And the fact that is not liable for that wrong may well be binding in future lawsuits involving the same events and circumstances. Q: If neither party appears, is the dismissal with or without prejudice? A: GS 1A1, Rule 41(b) states that a dismissal is with prejudice unless it falls into certain specified exceptions not relevant here, or unless the court specifically indicates to the contrary. The court has authority to so specifically indicate, but in light of the rule's \"default setting\" the rule seems to contemplate a general rule favoring dismissal with prejudice, with the court having authority to deviate from that when justice so requires. Local Practice Alert: Not all magistrates follow this practice. Some magistrates dismiss with prejudice if the appears and the plaintiff does not, while others require the to appear AND to request dismissal. Small Claims - Page 12 plaintiff defendant P a g e 7 If the is present and is not present , verify that the has provided a legally sufficient SCRA affidavit pertaining to whether is a member of the military. The affidavit must have the general form and contain the same information as AOCG250. Q: What is a legally sufficient affidavit? A: Plaintiff must have sworn to the truth of the statements before an official authorized to administer oaths and filed the completed document with the clerk. The must select one of three alternatives: is in the military is not in the military I am unable to determine whether is in the military If either of the last two alternatives are checked, the affidavit must contain specific facts in support of the selected alternative. Q: Who determines whether an affidavit is sufficient? A: The federal requirement applies to the judicial official conducting the trial\u2014not to the \u2014 and it is the judicial official who violates the law by proceedi ng to trial and entering judgment in the absence of an adequate affidavit. For this reason, it is the small claims magistrate who determines whether an affidavit is sufficient. Q: Does the law require the to check the DoD website and supply the results to the court? A: No. If the has sufficient information (SS# and/or DOB) to obtain a definitive result from the DoD website, few if any additional facts are likely to be necessary for the affidavit to be accepted by the magistrate. But the website is not a mandatory source of information, and in fact is not helpful in the absence of sufficient identifying informat ion about . The may rely on other evidence to support a conclusion that is not a servicemember. Q: What should the magistrate do if the affidavit simply states that the is unable to determine 's military status? Mandatory Rule #4: If defendant does not appear for trial, the SCRA prohibits the court from entering judgment in the absence of a legally sufficient affidavit attesting to the defendant's military status. Small Claims - Page 13 plaintiff defendant P a g e 8 A: This, without more, is an insufficient affidavit. The affidavit should state facts in support of the conclusion that the is unable to make this determination. Q: If is in the military, what should the magistrate do? A: The law requires that an attorney be appointed in this circumstance to contact to make sure knows both of the lawsuit and about 's rights to request a stay of proceedings under the SCRA. Determine whether the statutory requirements for minimum notice to have been satisfied: For summary ejectment cases: GS 42 29 requires sheriff's office to serve T \"at least two days prior to the day of trial.\" All other small claims cases: GS 7A214 requires a magistrate to continue the case if trial date is less than five days after is served. Q: What should the magistrate do if is present but the minimum notice requirements have not been met? A: The magistrate should inform that the law entitles the to additional time to prepare for trial if the wishes. If the waives the right to a continuance, the magistrate should proceed as usual with the case. If the prefers a continuance, the magistrate should continue the case for a time long enough to provide the with the minimum notice period. Mandatory Rule #5: Unless is present and waives a continuance, the magistrate must continue an action in which service of process was not accomplished a minimum time before trial. Local Practice Alert: The procedure for appointing an attorney when required by the SCRA is established by each county or judicial district. Because the SCRA applies to all civil cases, clerks and trial judges also encounter this requirement and should be able to answer any questions. Small Claims - Page 14 plaintiff defendant P a g e 9 AT THE BEGINNING OF TRIAL Identify the parties present and resolve any issues raised by the Pretrial Checklist. Deal with any lastminute developments. These are perhaps most likely to come up at the beginning of trial, but they sometimes arise as the parties present their evidence. Real party in interest (rpii) requirement : The law requires that the person bringing a lawsuit be the person who is entitled to the relief sought. If at any point during the trial it becomes clear that someone other than the is actually the injured party, the magistrate must offer the an opportunity to add or substitute the \"real party in interest,\" continuing the case if necessary. The most common instance of a rpii violation occurs when a property ma nagement company files a summary ejectment action in its own name, rather than in the name of the property owner. Plaintiff requests a voluntary dismissal. (Sometimes this happens before trial as well.) Rule: can dismiss the case at any point before s/he has finished presented eviden ce. Use AOCG108 to record the dismissal. has filed (or says she wants to file) a counterclaim. Q: What's a counterclaim? A: A counterclaim is simply a document (very similar to a complaint) in which asserts a claim against the . Generally, a counterclaim is filed as part of an answer, and the document should ideally be titled \"'s Answer & Counterclaim.\" Sometimes it may not be completely clear whether a intended to file a counterclaim or merely an answer. A counterclaim is different from an answer because it goes further. Instead of simply defending against 's claim, a is essentially saying, \"Not only do I not owe money. Plaintiff owes ME money!\" A Mandatory Rule #6: Every action must be brought in the name of the real party in interest. If the named plaintiff is not the rpii, the court must allow the plaintiff an opportunity to correct the error, continuing the case if necessary. Small Claims - Page 15 plaintiff defendant P a g e 1 0 is required to pay court costs for filing a counterclaim, just as a is for filing a complaint. Counterclaims will be discussed again in the Trial section of this document. Q: What should I do if files the counterclaim at the last minute and then brings a copy to trial, surprising the ? A: Assuming counterclaim meets above conditions, tell to give a copy. If needs time to prepare a defense, grant a continuance. Q: What if asks to file counterclaim after the time case is set for trial? A: Tell that s/he may file it as a separate action, but has missed the deadline for having the claim heard in this action. Q: What if counterclaim is for more than $10,000? A: has two choices: reduce the amount so that the counterclaim can be heard today, or take a voluntary dismissal and refile in district or superior court. NOTE: Be sure to inform that claimsplitting is not allowed, and that should accurately state all the damages s/he wishes to recover for the all eged wrongful act of the . Example: can't reduce a $18,000 counterclaim to $10,000 and then bring another action for the $8,000 excess. Q: What's the procedure if chooses to reduce the amount of damages? A: This requires to amend her counterclaim. The magistrate need only write something like the following in the Other section of the judgment, under Findings : \" filed a counterclaim in this action in the amount of $18,000\" but amended her complaint in open court to reduce the amount claimed to $10,000.\" I sue you! I sue you back! Rules for Counterclaims Must not exceed $10,000. Must be in writing. Must be filed with clerk before the time the trial is scheduled to begin. Small Claims - Page 16 plaintiff defendant P a g e 1 1 Q: What's the procedure if chooses to take a voluntary dismissal of her counterclaim? A: Be sure to state that in your judgment. Q: What happens to 's counterclaim if voluntarily dismisses his case? A: Verify that has received notice of the counterclaim, and then hear the counterclaim just as though it had been filed as a small claims action in the first place. One of the parties requests a continuance. If both parties are present and agree to a continuance, the law favors\u2014but does not compel\u2014 allowing it. If one party's request for a continuance is opposed by the other party, the party seeking a continuance must show good cause. There is reason to believe the has filed for ba nkruptcy. When a person files a bankruptcy petition, it triggers an automatic stay under federal law which prohibits creditors from attempting to collect debts from the person, including pursuing legal actions against the debtor. The stay goes into immediate effect when the petition is filed, and Mandatory Rule #7: If files a petition for bankruptcy, the small claims judge must stop the trial, discontinuing the action (using G108) until the automatic bankruptcy stay is lifted. \"[T]he trial court must pass on ... the question whether the moving party has acted with diligence and good faith. . . . The chief consideration to be weighed in passing on [the request] is whether the grant or denial of a continuance will be in furtherance of substantial justice.\" Shankle v. Shankle, 289 N.C. 473 (1976). Small Claims - Page 17 plaintiff defendant P a g e 1 2 any action taken by a state court thereafter is void, assuming the stay is applicable. (Criminal cases, for example, are not actions by a creditor and are not subject to the stay.) Q: Is the small claims judge subject to the stay even if the takes no action to inform the court that a bankruptcy petition has been filed? A: Yes. The stay goes into effect automatically, and judgments entered in violation of the stay\u2014 whether knowingly or not\u2014are void. Q: What should a magistrate do upon learning that a bankruptcy petition has been filed? A: Fill out the bottom portion of AOCG108, discontinuing the action until the stay has been lifted. Do not dismiss the action. Q: Does the stay apply to actions for summary ejectment? A: Yes, unless judgment was entered prior to 's filing the bankruptcy petition. A landlord is not without a remedy in this situation, however; the landlord may ask the bankruptcy court to lift the stay in regard to the tenant's obligation to pay rent. HEARING THE EVIDENCE Place both parties and any witnesses under oath at the outset. Explain to both parties that you will make a decision only after hearing from them both. Because the has the burden of proving the case by the greater weight of the evidence, must testify first. If only the is present, administer the oath to and any witnesses and hear testimony just as you would if were present. This situation is handled exactly as though were present, but presented no effective defense. Exception: In summary ejectment actions may request a judgment on the pleadings and thereby avoid the requirement that prove entitlement to relief. Small Claims - Page 18 plaintiff defendant P a g e 1 3 The degree of formality with which a small claims trial is conducted lies within the discretion of the magistrate. It is appropriate for magistrates to question witnesses and to provide the parties with information about small claims procedure, so long as the magistrate is careful to avoid asking leading questions, advising a party about the best course of action, or acting in a manner showing favoritism to either party. Trying a Case with a Counterclaim Recommended: Conduct the trial in two parts, trying the primary claim first and then separately hearing evidence on the counterclaim. After you've heard and decided both cases, calculate the total amount of the judgment, setting off as n ecessary. Enter one judgment, making clear how you ruled on both cases and what damages were awarded in each case. Amending the Complaint The law says that a judge should freely allow a to amend a complaint. Assuming the statute of limitations has not run, there is little reason to deny such a motion. Generally, the only issue of concern is whether fairness requires a continuance so that particularly an absent can be given notice and make any necessary adjustments to defend against the amended claim. Amendment to correct name? Allowed, provided that the correct person was served. Not allowed to substitute a different . Amendment to substitute reme dy? Common in actions to recover property where creditor discovers property is no longer in 's possession. Creditor should be allowed to amend complaint to request money owed, but take care that has notice of amendment. Amendment to amount requested? Allowed, but be sure has notice of increased amount. Amendment to change the ory of recovery (aka, checked the wrong box)? Unnecessary, but allowed. Again, issue is notice to . Mandatory Rule #8: Whether or not is present at trial, must prove the essential elements of the case by the greater weight of the evidence (subject to one exception). Small Claims - Page 19 plaintiff defendant P a g e 1 4 Q: What is the procedure for amending a complaint? A: In small claims court a motion to amend is often made during trial. In this circumstance, it is not necessary for the to physically write the amendment on the complaint. It is preferable for the magistrate to write the amendment on the judgment form. ENTERING JUDGMENT AND OTHER POSTTRIAL ISSUES Usually, small claims judgments are announced in open court. If the magistrate prefers, the magistrate may reserve judgment for up to 10 days. Note the exception for summary ejectment cases. GS 7A221(b) prohibits a magistrate from reserving judgment unless the parties agree or the case is complex. If the magistrate reserves judgment because the case is complex, judgment must be rendered within five business days. Q: What's the procedure for reserving judgment? A: The magistrate should inform the parties that they will receive a copy of the written judgment within the next two weeks, and explain the procedure for appeal. The magistrate must complete the section at the bottom of the judgment form labeled Certification , have the judgment stamped in by the clerk, and mail a copy to both parties. Q: Can a magistrate correct a clerical error in a judgment? A: A magistrate can correct a clerical error at any time, on the magistrate's own motion. Note that a clerical erro r is an error that does not affect the legal rights of the parties. For that reason, notice to the parties is usually not necessary. An example would be misspelling the name of one of the parties. See Small Claims Law p. 41 for details of procedure. Mandatory Rule #9: The judgment must contain the magistrate's decision about all claims in relation to all parties. Steps in Entering Judgment Make a clear division between the close of evidence and your readiness to announce your decision. Announce your decision, clearly identifying by name the party you're ruling in favor of. Provide a brief explanation of the legal reason for your decision. Allow the parties to ask questions about next steps, and inform the losing party of the right to appeal. Small Claims - Page 20 plaintiff defendant P a g e 1 5 Appeal The remedy for a magistrate's legal error is appeal to district court for trial de novo . Q: What is trial de novo ? A: When a small claims judgment is appealed, the district court judge conducts a whole new trial. The parties are not bound by their decisions at the small claims level: they may make new arguments, present new evidence, and even change the re medy they're seeking in the lawsuit. Q: What is the procedure for appeal? A: A party may give notice of appeal in two ways, either by notifying the small claims judge in open court, or by filing a written notice of appeal with the clerk within 10 days. An appealing party must pay costs of appeal within 20 days, or else appeal is dismissed. Note: costs must be paid within 10 days in summary ejectment actions. A party who cannot afford to pay the costs of appeal may be excused by qualifying as indigent. Q: What is the effect of the small claims judgment while an appeal is pending in district court? A: A judgment for money is automatically stayed when a party gives notice of appeal. An judgment awarding possession of real or personal property is not automatically stayed and so may be enforced just as if there were no appeal. In summary ejectment actions a tenant appealing a judgment in favor of a landlord can delay enforcement of the judgment through a procedure in the clerk's office requiring the tenant to pay the undisputed rent in arrears and sign an undertaking to pay rent as it comes due. Q: What happens after the small claims judgment? A: A who wins in small claims court is not permitted to enforce a judgment immediately; first, the 10day period during which the may give notice of appeal must end. Only then may the initiate enforcement procedures by going to the clerk. There is an additional cost to Mandatory Rule #10: The judgment in a small claims action is a final judgment and may be changed only by appeal or by an order entered pursuant to Rule 60(b) setting the judgment aside. Small Claims - Page 21 plaintiff defendant P a g e 1 6 enforce a judgment, which will be added to the costs owed by the losing party. The next steps vary, depending on whether the judgment is for money or recovery of rental or personal property. Some magistrates provide the parties a copy of the handout in the Reference Section titled \"What Happens After Small Claims Court.\" Motions to Set Aside Judgment under Rule 60(b ) Rule 60(b) sets out six reasons for setting aside a judgment. The first ground is that the judgment should be set aside because of excusable neglect, mistake, or surprise. In small claims, the \"excusable neglect\" at issue almost always involves a party's failure to appear. When a judgment is set aside under Rule 60(b), the case will be retried, usually based on the original complaint with no need to repeat service of process. Q: What is the procedure for deciding whether to set aside a judgment? A: Typically, the losing party files a motion to set aside the judgment, specifying the reason. Motions must be filed within a reasonable time, usually within one year. The other party is given notice of the motion, and the court conducts a hearing on whether the motion should be granted. Q: Who conducts the hearing? A: A district court judge generally hears Rule 60(b) motions, but some magistrates are authorized by their chief district court judge to hear motions provided that the motion is based on Rule 60(b)(1) (mistake, excusable neglect, inadvertence, or surprise.) Q: How does a magistrate determine whether the judgment should be set aside? A: The test is whether the party who made the error gave the case \"such attention as a man of ordinary prudence usually gives to important business affairs.\" If the moving party is , she must also allege that she has a meritorious defense to 's claim. Finally, our appellate courts have repeatedly stated tha t a motion under Rule 60(b) is not to be used as a substitute for appeal. If the error in question was a legal error made by the magistrate, the judgment will not be set aside (unless the error was so serious that it renders the judgment void). Q: If a magistrate decides to set aside the judgment, how is this decision implemented? Small Claims - Page 22 plaintiff defendant P a g e 1 7 A: The magistrate enters a written order setting aside the judgment, making appropriate findings about the grounds for doing so and, if the motion was filed by the , the existence of a meritorious defense. The magistrate should then recalendar the case for trial.

In general, evidence is admi ssible and entitled to consideration if it is relevant to an issue in the case and reliable ( that is, likely to be true). Why? Small claims court is not subject to review on appeal in the same way other trial courts are, so whether evidence does or does not become part of the record is not relevant in the same way. Small claims cases never involve juries, and so the legal principles governing consideration of evidence that apply to trials before the judge without a jury are more relevant than are the rules used in jury trials. Unless evidence is objected to, or unless you, the judge, feel that the evidence is such that it might improperly bias your decision, it sh ould be freely admitted - and given appropriate weight. When evidence is objected to, it is appropriate to rule on the objection by admitting the evidence but pointing out that its weight is to be determined. When an attorney repeatedly objects\u2014or when you anticipate that this may happen - it is proper to instruct the attorney to hold objections until the close of the evidence, at which point the attorney may be allowed to present arguments about its weight and admissibility. What you might say: \"As you know, we are about to conduct a trial before the judge without a jury, and one of the parties is not represented by an attorney, which is often the case in this court. My policy in such situations is to be lenient in allowing evidence to be offered, so that parties may testify without interruption. At the close of the evidence, I will hear any argument the parties would like to offer about evidence that you believe I should not consider. After hearing your argument, I will carefully consider all the relevant admissible evidence and determine what weight I will give it before arriving at my decision.\" Factors to consider in assessing credibility: Motive to lie Corroborating evidence Person in best position to observe Demeanor Ability to provide details Which version seems more likely? Small Claims - Page 27Notes: A Note on Dealing With Attorneys ~ Remember that attorneys have a different role, and thus a different agenda, than you in your role as a judicial official. ~Don't expect that an attorney will necessarily a pprove of or agree with your decisions, or the way you run your courtroom. Be respectful and polite, but be prepared to be assertive if necessary in maintaining control of the courtroom. ~ Like everyone else, attorneys vary in skill and ability. Don't assume that an attorney is more knowledgeable than you about the law, and don't accept general proclamations about what \"the law says\" at face value. ~ Let attorneys know that you will not rule in their favor unless they explain their argument clearly, in a way that everyone in the courtroom can understand. Communicate that you won't be intimidated into ruling favorably by a complicated jargon-laden legal argument made quickly and without regard for your ability to understand . This is an appropriate requirement, and one that an advocate should anticipate and respect. ~Never hesitate to require an attorney to establish the truth of his or her contentions by supplying a copy of a case or statute, granting a brief continuance if necessary for the attorney to obtain a copy or for you to read it carefully. Insist that copies of cases and statutes be complete, and specifically ask whether the law provided is current as of the date of trial if you have any reason to be doubtful. ~Be aware of procedural errors frequently made by attorneys unused to small claims practice. ~Particularly when confronted with an attorney who is disruptive or insists on interrupting the testimony of the unrepresented party, be prepared to cite GS Ch. 8C, Rule 611, which provides: The court shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and order of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to (1) make the interrogation and presentation effective for the ascertainment of the truth, (2) avoid needless consumption of time, and (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment. ~Similarly, when confronted with an attorney who objects to your questioning of parties or contends that your participation is inappropriate because you are \"helping,\" be prepared to cite Rule 614, which says . . . The court may, on its own motion or at the suggestion of a party call witnesses, and all parties are entitled to cross-examine witnesses thus called. . . . The court may interrogate witnesses, whether called by itself or a party. Small Claims - Page 28Four Rules of Evidence You Should Know Business records exception to hearsay rule Writing or records of acts, events, conditions, opinions, or diagnosis, made at or near the time by, or from information transmitted by, a person with knowledge are admissible if kept in the regular course of business and if it was the regular course of business to make that record, unless the source information or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness. G.S. 8-45: Verified statement of account In an action on an account for goods sold, rent s, services rendered, or labor performed, or any oral contract for money loaded, a verifi ed itemized statement of the account is admissible into evidence and is deemed correct unless disputed by the defendant. Verified: Accompanied by an affidavit from a person who (1) would be competent to testify at trial; (2) has personal knowledge of the particular account, or of the books and records of the business in general; and (3 ) swears that the account is correct and presently is owed by defendant to plaintiff. Itemized: Describes each item with price and item number, if there is one. Best Evidence Rule (paraphrased) When an action by a party is based on a right created by a written contract, and the content of that contract is in dispute, the party must either produce the contract or adequately explain why he is unable to do so. Parole Evidence Rule When contract is in writing, parties may not introduce evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreement that varies the terms of the written contract Note that the rule has no appl ication in two circumstances: (1) When the evidence is offered to assist the court in determining the meaning of an ambiguous term in the contract; and (2) when the evidence offered relates to an oral agreement taking place after the written contract and thus in support of an allegation that the written contract was subsequently modified by a later oral agreement. Small Claims - Page 29 Small Claims - Page 30Small Claims: What Lawyers Need to Know Small claims procedure is governed in large part by GS Ch. 7A, Art. 19. The Rules of Civil Procedure apply only when Article 19 does not contain a more specific rule applicable to small claims court. Here are a few of the most significant differences in small claims procedure: Service by publication is allowed only in (certain) cases involving motor vehicle liens. G.S. 7A 217, 211.1. Motions to dismiss based on Rule 12(b)(6) are not permitted. See GS 7A216 (referring to such motions by the old common law term \"demurrer\"). The defendant is not required to file an answer, and failure to do so constitutes a general denial. G.S. 7A 218. There are no default judgments in small claims, and (with the exception of summary ejectment actions meeting the requirements set out in GS 4230 for obtaining a judgment on the pleadings) the plaintiff must prove the case by the greater weight of the eviden ce even if the defendant files no answer and fails to appear at trial. The compulsory counterclaim rule does not apply in small claims court. GS 7A 219. The result in a case in which the plaintiff fails to produce sufficient evidence to establish a right to relief is a judgment of dismissal . Time periods for service of process, calendaring a case for hearing, and giving notice of appeal are abbreviated in small claims court. The procedure overall is less formal, and the rules of evidence are only generally observed. See GS 7A 222. Appeal of a small claims judgment is to district court for trial de novo. Small Claims - Page 31 Small Claims - Page 32WHAT HAPPENS AFTER SMALL CLAIMS COURT Location of Clerk's Office: __________________________________ Notice to Both Parties If you are either the plaintiff (the person suing) or defendant (the person being sued) and are unhappy with the decision of the ma gistrate, you may appeal the case to district court. You may appeal either by telling the magistrate at the trial that you want to appeal or by filing a written request with the clerk of court within 10 days after the magistrate ruled in your case. If yo u want to file a written request, ask the clerk to give you a copy of form AOC -CVM -303, which is the notice of appeal form. If you give written notice of appeal to the clerk, you must also send a copy of the form to the opposing parties in your case. Whe ther you appeal in open court or file a written appeal, you MUST PAY $150 court costs to the clerk . These costs must be paid within 20 days of the magistrate's ruling, unless you are a tenant appealing from judgment in a summary ejectment action, in whic h case the costs must be paid within 10 days of the magistrate 's ruling . If you cannot pay the appeal costs, you may be able to qualify to file your appeal as an indigent. If you are a tenant appealing an eviction and you want to continue to live at the premises until the case is heard on appeal, you will be required to pay past due rent to the clerk and to sign an undertaking that you will pay rent into the court as it becomes due to keep the judgment from being carried out. If you meet the requirements for appeal as an indigent, you may be excused from the requirement that you pay past due rent in order to remain on the premises while the appeal is pending. If one party appeals, there will be a completely new trial before a dis trict court judge. (In some cases , the matter may be assigned first to an arbitrator. If that occurs contact the clerk to have the procedure explained to you.) The clerk will notify both parties of the trial date (usually by mailing the trial calendar), and both must appear at tha t time. If you are the defendant and don't appear at trial, the plaintiff will probably win the case. Both parties should bring all your evidence and witnesses to the trial. The trial before the district court judge will be more formal than the one befo re the magistrate; therefore, you may wish to consider hiring an attorney to represent you. Notice to Plaintiff (Party Suing) If you won your case, your judgment against the defendant is good for 10 years. Before the end of the 10 years, you may bring an other lawsuit to extend the judgment an additional 10 years. If you have won a money judgment, it becomes a lien against any land owned by the defendant, which means the defendant cannot sell that land without paying your judgment. Just because you have a judgment does not mean that you will be able to collect it. The defendant must have enough property to enable the sheriff to sell the property to satisfy the judgment. You may try as many times in the 10 -year period as you wish to collect the judgment. If you have won a judgment that the defendant owes you money, the court cannot try to help you collect that money unless you have given the defendant an opportunity to claim his or her exemptions. \"Exemptions\" is a legal term referring to a judgment debto r's right to shelter certain property from being seized and sold to satisfy a judgment. After the judgment is rendered, you must get two forms (Notice of Rights and Motion to Claim Exempt Property) from the clerk. You must serve these on the defendant. The back of the Notice of Rights tells you how to serve the forms. If you have not heard anything from the defendant within 20 days after you have served the Notice of Rights and Motion, you may go to the clerk ask to have an execution issued. The back o f the Notice of Rights form tells you what you have to bring to the clerk. If the defendant responds to your notice and claims exemptions, you may either (1) agree with the exemptions claimed and ask the clerk to issue an execution for non -exempt property or (2) object to the claimed exemptions and have the district court judge determine the exempt property. After the district Small Claims - Page 33judge determines the defendant's exemptions, you may ask the clerk to issue an execution for all nonexempt property. You will hav e to pay $ 55 to have an execution issued --$25 for the court and $ 30 for the sheriff. Those costs will be added to the judgment to be repaid by the defendant. An execution is an order to the sheriff to seize and sell property of the defendant to satisfy t he judgment. If you know of any property that belongs to the defendant, you should attach to the execution a description of the property and where it may be found to help the sheriff. The sheriff will sell any property that can be found and turn the proc eeds over to the clerk of court, who will then turn the money over to you. If the defendant pays all or part of the money owed to you directly, you MUST go to the clerk's office and indicate how much you have been paid. If you have a judgment ordering the defendant to turn personal property over to you and if the defendant has not turned it over within 10 days after the magistrate enters the judgment, you may ask the clerk to issue a writ of possession to the sheriff. The cost to you for having the writ iss ued is $25, plus $ 30 for the sheriff. The sheriff will then try to recover the property from the defendant and turn it over to you. You may be asked to advance the costs of having the sheriff pick up the property. If you are a landlord and have a judgmen t for eviction and the tenant fails to leave the premises within 10 days after the judgment was rendered, you may pay $25 and have the clerk issue a writ of possession to the sheriff. The sheriff will then remove the defendant from the premises. You will have to pay the sheriff $ 30. You may be asked to advance the costs of removing the tenant's property and one month's storage costs or you may request the sheriff , in writing, to lock the premises and you will then be responsible for handling the tenant's property in the manner required by the law. If the defendant won a judgment against you on a counterclaim, read the section below for defendants. Notice to Defendant (Party Being Sued) If a judgment is entered against you stating that you owe the plaintiff money and you want to pay the amount owed, it would be safer to pay the money to the clerk of court rather than to the plaintiff. If you do pay the plaintiff directly, make sure he or she notifies the clerk so the judgment won't continue to be listed against you. If you cannot or do not pay the judgment, the plaintiff will serve a notice of rights on you, telling you that you must claim your exemptions or they will be waived. It is very important that you respond to that notice. Exemptions are property the law allows you to keep from being taken from you to pay off judgments against you. If you fail to claim your exemptions, the sheriff will be able to seize and sell any property you own. If you fail to claim your exemptions when notified, you may ask the clerk to set aside your waiver if you have the grounds. Also, even if you have waived your statutory exemptions, you may go to the clerk any time up until the proceeds of the sale of your property have been distributed to the plaintiff and request yo ur constitutional exemptions. The judgment is good against you for 10 years and may be extended for another 10 years. It becomes a lien against any land you own now or buy later until it is satisfied. If you have a judgment against you to turn personal p roperty over to the plaintiff, you may not prevent the property from being turned over to the plaintiff unless the plaintiff is a finance company and the judgment against you is to recover household goods that you listed as collateral in a security agreeme nt with the finance company and the finance company did not lend you the money to buy those goods. In that case, the finance company must give you notice of your right to claim exemptions as described in the paragraph above and you may keep the household goods from being repossessed by claiming them as exempt. If you are a tenant and have an eviction judgment against you, you will have to leave the premises. If you do not leave voluntarily, the sheriff may forcibly evict you and remove and store your belo ngings for you or may leave them with the landlord who may dispose of them in the manner allowed by the law. You will be held responsible for the costs of moving you out. If you won a counterclaim against the plaintiff in which you were awarded money, r ead the section for plaintiffs to see what to do. Small Claims - Page 34Words of Wisdom About Small Claims Procedure Always begin with \"Who is suing whom, for what?\" Who are the parties, and what are the claims? If the answers to these questions are not crystal clear from the complaint & summons, get those answers first. Focusing on this question at the ve ry beginning helps you remember the most important rule: Notice is a very big deal. And so is jurisdiction. There is a difference between an order \u2014which does something with a pending lawsuit\u2014and a judgment , which makes a determination based on the evidence about th e merits of a case. Your judgment should dispose of all the parties and all the claims. These three things should be identical : Your written judgment Your spoken judgment Your actual decision Finality of judgments is a very big deal. Everyone makes errors, and profession al decision-makers make lots of them. The remedy for legal errors made by a judicial official is appeal. Not changing your judgment. See previous principle. Decide the case in front of you.

Small Claims - Page 37 Small Claims - Page 38The Difference between an Order and a Judgment When a magistrate has heard evidence in a case and makes a decision based on that evidence, the formal document re flecting that decision is a judgment of the court. It is recorded on the appropriate AOC-CVM judgment form, signed by the magistrate, and filed with the clerk. Entry of judgment is one of the law's Momentous Moments\u2014like the effect of a deed, a divorce decree, or an honorable discharge, the rights of an individual are significantly different the moment after judgment is entered than the moment before. Because of this, a fundamental legal preference is expressed in the phrase \"finality of judgments.\" A judgment can be modified or set aside, but not without observation of formal legal requirements and never without good reason. One of many confusing facts in the world of small claims law is that when a plaintiff fails to prove the case by the greater weight of the ev idence, the law (and the AOC forms) uses the term dismissal to describe the outcome. In the la rger legal world, to say a case is dismissed means that it has been finally disposed of without the parties having produced evidence and the court deciding it on the merits. In Sma ll Claims Land, that's also true, but the word is used more broadly to encompass a decision on the merits against the plaintiff. While the terminology overlaps, it's import ant to distinguish the two very different outcomes, one of which is a judgment on the merits and the other is . . .not. Instead, the other (confusingly termed a dismissal ) brings a case to an end without a judgment being entered. The AOC form for recording a dismi ssal\u2014and actually other significant events occurring during the lifetime of a case\u2014is G-108, the generic Order form. G-108 is used to record a dismissal in any of the following events: 1) The plaintiff has decided not to proceed with the case at this time, and has not yet finished presenting evidence (a voluntary dismissal ). 2) The plaintiff has completed presenting evidence, but asks to dismiss and the court allows it (also a voluntary dismissal ). 3) The plaintiff failed to appear for trial (an involuntary dismissal ). 4) Neither party appeared for trial (an involuntary dismissal ). The AOC Order form has checkboxes allowing a magistrate to indicate that a dismissal is with or without prejudice. A dismissal with prejudice bars the plaintiff from later filing an identical action. A dismissal without prejudice , on the other hand, preserves the plaintiff's right to sue the defendant at a later point for the same alleged wrong. Generally, a voluntary dismissal is without prejudice. A magistrate should check the box indicating with prejudice only if the plaintiff so indicates. An example of an appropriate fact situation would be if the plaintiff informs the court that the plaintiff wishes to take a voluntary dismissal because the defendant has paid all that is owed. Generally, an involuntary dismissal is with prejudice. If the plaintiff fails to appear and the defendant appears and requests a dismissal, the law provides that the dismissal is with prejudice. When neither party appears, the same result generally applies, although a magistrate may dismiss without prejudice if justice requires. In some cases it may be best for the magist rate to check neither box and instead explain the dismissal. A common example arises when a plaintiff files a case in small claims which Small Claims - Page 39DGL/SOG/2015 is not eligible for hearing in that court. A dismissal with prejudice is subject to being understood as a ruling that the plaintiff may not refile the action in any court. A dismissal without prejudice is sometimes misunderstood by a plaintiff unfamiliar with the law to mean the case can be refiled in small claims court. In such a case the magistrate should simply check \"involuntary dismissal\" and write on the order form that the magistrate is without jurisdiction to hear the case in small claims court.

Agency Guarantors Joint and Several Liability Husbands, Wives, and Kids WHAT ARE THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT? If the agreement is in writing, ask for a copy. Read it carefully. Are the terms clear? If the agreement is not in writing, listen to the testimony about the terms. Do the parties agree about the terms of their agreement? If they don't agree, what specifically do they disagree about? What does contend? What does contend? In the case of a disagreement, the magistrate must determine the terms, remembering that the party seeking to enforce the contract has the B/P on its terms. Are there terms they left out? Assuming the intent to contract is clear, the magistrate \"fills in the blanks\" based on evidence about what is usual and reasonable, to implement the probable intention of the parties. What rules of evidence should the magistrate be mindful of in determining the terms? If a contract is written, the best evidence of what the parties agreed to is the written contract. If a contract is written, evidence about what the parties said before signing the contract is not relevant unless meaning is unclear (parol evidence rule). In an action on an account, a verified itemized statement of the account is sufficient to prove that owes that amount of mo ney in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Are there additional or different te rms written into the agreement by the law? In contracts for the sale of goods , is 's claim for breach of warranty? In actions based on a lease, does the landlord have additional responsibilities under the RRAA? In actions involving consumer credit sales, does the Retail Installment Sale s Act affect any of the contract terms?

Is this particular defendant (rather than someone else) bound by the contract? Does the contract involve a corporation? Does the contract involve an agency relationship?

Activity Contracts - Page 15 Contracts - Page 16A Basic Introduction to Contract Law Although contract law can become extremely complicated, at heart it is really very simple. A contract is nothing more than an agreement between two or more people that each will do something in exchange for receiving something. Regardless of whether a contract has hundreds of pages of fine print or consists of a few words and a handshake , there are four broad categories of legal issues that come up again and again. Contract F ormation More often than one might think, fa ct situations may raise an issue about whether the parties actually have entered into a contract. The critical factors are (1) that the parties each agreed to a deal in which (2) each of them gives something up and gets something in return. See what you think about the following fact situations: contract or no? 1. I promise to give my daughter a pony for her birthday. Contract? Yes No 2. Luna and I agree that I will pay her $35 if she will cut my grass , and she agrees to do so. Contract? Yes No 3. I make an appointment to see my doctor, and she diagnoses a cold. Contract? Yes No 4. I put an ad in the paper saying \"sofa for sale \u2014best offer.\" Before Phil shows up at my door saying he'd like to buy it, though, I chan ge my mind. Contract? Yes No 5. I agree to pay Samantha $1500 for her gently-used computer, b ut decide on the way to pick it up that I'd be better off buying a new one. Contract? Yes No 6. I agree to pay Samantha $1500 for her gently-used computer , but discover after I get home with it that the same computer costs $400 if I buy it new. Contract? Yes No Answers and Explanation s: 1. No contract. I promised to make a gift, but my daughter didn't give up anything \u2014there was no agreement or bargain here. It would be different, though, if I had said, \"If you do all the work in the garden this summer, I'll buy you a pony\" and my daughter said, \"Deal!\" Contracts - Page 172. Contract. I agreed to give up money for the benefit of getting my g rass cut, and Luna agreed to do the work for the benefit of being paid. 3. Contract. Even though there was no negotiation between me and my doctor, it is common knowledge throughout our society that when you seek out treatment by a doctor, you will be charged a reasonable fee. There was agreement here, but it was implied from our behavior, rather than being a verbal agreement. 4. No contract. By putting an ad in the paper, I indicated my willingness to consider offers for the sofa, but I didn't enter into an agreement with Phil. The result might be different, though, if my ad said, \"I'll sell my sofa to the first person who shows up at my door with $150 cash.\" In that case, I've made an offer, and indicated that a contract will come into existence if Phil shows up at my door with $150. If I change my mind, I will have to withdraw my offer before Phil accepts\u2014 I may need to put a sign in my front yard saying, \"I withdraw my offer. Keep your money. I love my sofa.\" 5. Contract. Because Sam antha and I hav e entered into an agreement, in which I give up money and get a computer, and she gives up her computer and gets money, I've lost the right to change my mind. Even though the actual performance of the contract has not yet occurred, the agreement has, and so a contract has been formed. Quite often a contract consists of an exchange of promises to perform, with performance occurring at a later date. 6. Contract. Whether a bargain is a good one or a bad one doesn't affect whether a contract has been formed. (Although in some extreme cases, it may affect whether the law will enforce that contract.) Freedom of contract means that we are all free to make a bad bargain. Be sure to note the questions you missed and pay particular attention to the rule in those situations. Be sure to ask the instructor if you're puzzled. Note: An important step in analyzing contract cases is determining WHO is liable under the contract. One common situation involves spouses who together enter into a contract, promising to pay the amount owed. Example: Luna and Jane have been married for a little over a year, and they've decided it's time to buy furniture. They both sign an installment sales contract provided for 12 easy monthly payments of $135. If they fail to pay the amount owed, the furniture store has a choice under the legal principle of joint and several liability. It can sue Luna and Jane together, or either of them separately. If the store sues one of them separately, it can sue for the entire amount due\u2014each of them has p romised to pay the entire amount due. Contracts - Page 18Change the facts: Luna buys the furniture, signs the agreement, gets tired of Jane, and moves to Canada. Can the furniture store sue Jane? [See p.9 for answer and explanation.] Determining the Terms of the C ontract Before you can decide whether a contract has been breached, you have to know what the contract requires each party to do. The details about the agreement between the parties are called the terms of the contract. Judges are happiest when the terms of a co ntract are clear: preferably written and with enough detail , but without being so complicated that it's hard to understand. All too often, though, it's not easy to determine exactly what the parties agreed to. In trying to figure that out, says the law, judges should have as a guiding beacon the question of what the parties intended. [But note : When the terms of an agreement are clear, the law will not rewrite a contract even if the evidence shows that one of the parties intended something different.] Sometimes it is difficult to identify the terms of a contract because the agreement between the parties was oral, and the evidence is conflicting about what the agreement was. In these cases, an important legal principle helps you as the judge decide what t o do: The party who has the burden of proof (usually the plaintiff) has the responsibility of producing enough evidence to persuade you that the terms of the contract were most likely what s/he says they were. If you believe that the version offered by that party is the more likely version (i.e., \"by the greater weight of the evidence\"), then that term is treated as part of the contract. What if you conclude instead that his contention is possible? That term does not become a part of the contract unless y ou conclude that it is not only possible, but in fact more likely than not. Try it out: Joanna is suing for money owed, saying that she lent Tom $50 three months ago, and that Tom promised to pay her back \"within the next couple of months\" with in terest b ut has never done so. Tom says he borrowed the money to buy textbooks for college, and that he and Joanna agreed he would repay the loan at the end of this semester, when Tom begins working at his summer job. You're not sure who to believe. What do you do? Check p. 9 for answer and explanation.) Sometimes the problem is not that the evidence about the terms is conflicting, but instead that there was no discussion about a term at all . In this case, the law sometimes fills in the blank s, and sometimes it does not. The rules about this are complicated, and a specific case may present a situation in which you need to consult reference material or ask for help. In many instances, though, your common sense will lead you to a correct result. When it is Contracts - Page 19obvious to you from the evidence that a term was not important to either party, or was obvious to both parties, the legal solution is usually to fill in the blank. Example: I walk by a store and see a black sweater on a mannequin in the window. The mannequi n is on a table containing many identical sweaters. The clerk notices my interest and asks if I would like to buy a sweater. I answer, \"Yes\u2014that's a great looking sweater.\" He boxes it up for me, and I pay for it, but when I open the box at home, I discover a polka-dot sweater. The salesclerk and I did not explicitly state that a term of the contract was that the sweater in the box would be identical to the sweater on the table. Nevertheless, that was an implied term of the contract. Problem: Same fact s, except this time the folded sweaters on the table are variously colored and patterned. The clerk says, \"Would you like to pick one out?\" and I respond, \"No, thanks. Just box one up for me.\" Can you conclude from this evidence that one term of the con tract was that the sweater would be black? ( Check p.10 for answer and explanation.) There is a special legal rule called the parol evidence rule about deciding what the terms of a contract are. [Parol is an old French word meaning \" spoken words.\" The simil ar French word parole meant \"word of honor.\" Cool, huh?] The legal name for this rule m akes it sound very technical, but it actually amounts to common sense. The rule simply says that if a written contract is clear, but one party wants to introduce evide nce that the actual verbal agreement between the parties was different from what is written down, the judge will base the decision on what is written down. The logic, of course, is that what is written down is more reliable evidence than recollections about what people said. Also, the law wants to encourage people to write their agreements down, so part of the reason for this rule is to support that encouragement. There are a couple of exceptions to the parol evidence rule, though . See if you can figure them out, based on the fact situations below: Sol and Luna sign a written agreement that says, \"I, Sol , will pay Luna $75 for performing yard work on my yard. Luna will complete this work between the 1 st and the 5th of this month, and I will pay h er upon completion.\" Question #1 : Luna has brought an action for money owed against Sol after Sol refused to pay h er. Sol says that's because Luna didn't trim the shrubbery. Luna wants to introduce evidence that, at the time they were negotiating the agreement, she asked Sol what he meant by \"yard work\" and Sol said, \" Mowing and raking the grass, edging the lawn, and using the weedeater in places where you can't get the mower.\" Ba sed on this part of their negotiation, Luna says, trimming the shrubbery was not actually included in their agreement, and thus she did not breach by failing to do so. In this case, the judge can consider Luna 's testimony. Can you figure out why? Contracts - Page 20Question #2: In this situation , Luna and Sol have entered into the same written agreement, but this time Sol wants to testify that, two weeks after they signed the contract, he asked Luna to include trimming the shrubbery, and Luna agreed, with the understanding that the she would have five extra days to do the work. The judge can consider this testimony. Can you figure out why? [See p. 10 for answers.] There's another situation in which a contract may have important terms even though the parties didn't discuss them, much less agree to them. Thes e terms are automatically part of contracts inv olving the sale of goods under a comprehensive statute known as the Uniform Commercial Code. These special terms are called implied warranties , and there are two of them: The implied warranty of merchantability is a term automatically inserted in a contrac t for the sale of goods to the effect that the seller promi ses (or \"warrants\") that the product it will do what it is ordinarily expected to do. An iron will get hot; a refrigerator will get cold. It doesn't matter that the contract doesn't say that explicitly (although often the contract will, and that's called an express warranty, or guarantee). If a person buys a a new television set that doesn't work, he has a legal claim that an implied term of the contract has been breached\u2014the term that says the TV set I'm buying from you will work. Note that this implied term applies only when the seller is a merchant. If you buy an iron at a yard sale, y ou're on your own! The implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is another term that makes good sense. That term says that if I consult a merchant who is in a specialize d business or otherwise purports to be someone who has some expertise about which product is best for some particular purpose, there is an implied promise that the goods I buy based on that advice will be suited to that particular purpose. Let's say I go to a store that sells running shoes and tell the clerk I'm going to run the Boston Marathon , and I buy a pair of running shoes base d on the advice of the salesman. Two weeks into my training, the shoes start to fall apart. I now have a legal claim that an implied term of the contract has been breached\u2014 the term that says these shoes will be suited for marathon running. The rules about warranties are the first examples we've discussed of an important aspect of contra ct law: consumer protection legislation. This is a subject we'll return to in a few page s. For now, just notice that the law sometimes inserts or deletes a contract term, despite our society's commitment to the ideal of freed om of contract, in order to p rotect consumers. There are exceptions and qualifications to the rules about implied warranties. One of the best known is that, when a seller sells something \"as-is,\" the seller makes no warranty about the condition of the goo ds. If you are confronted with a case involving a technical Contracts - Page 21legal dispute about a question such as whether an attempted waiver of warranty was legally effective, or some similar complex question, it would be best to reserve judgment and consult reference material or otherwise seek as sistance. Is the Contract One That the Law W ill Enforce? So far, I have indicated several times that common sense is a generally reliable guide in arriving at a correct legal answer in cont ract cases. That statement is much less true when it comes to the rules about legal enforcement of contracts. While there are sound reasons for the legal principles to which we will now turn our attention, sometimes the result of their application in particular cases may seem to contradict c ommon sense. The usual reason for this is that the principle is based on a policy decision made by our society that works well most of the time but may yield surprising or unfair results in a particular case. Remember : This situation comes up after you ha ve decided that the parties have entered into a contract , you have ascertained its terms, and you have determined that one party has breached the contract. Under what circumstances might the court, in this situation, nevertheless refuse to give the compla ining party a remedy? First, the law will usually refuse to e nforce a contract in which one of the parties was not able (i.e., lacked capac ity) to give legal consent. Stop here and ask yourself: what is an example of a party not able to give legal consent to a contract? _________________________________ If you said minors or persons who are mentally incompetent, you were correct. The general rule is that a contract by a minor or mentally incompetent person is not enforceable against that person. [Note th at the law is perfectly willing to enforce a contract against another person on behalf of a minor or incompetent \u2014we don't worry about protecting the interests of those who can protect themselves.] Similarly, a person who contracts because he has been tricked or misled, or who has been coerced in an illegal way, does not truly consent to the contract, and the law will not hold him to it. This is one of those general principles that have a lot of exceptions. Let's look at the rule, and at some of the excep tions, in the examples below. Example #1: Luna is 17 and looks 22. When she bought a car from Fast Eddie, she assured him she was 21. After she wrecks the car, she wants to return it and get a complete refund of her money. Can she? Example #2: Jane is a quiet woman with a sweet smile who gives no outward sign that she suffe rs from Alzheimer's and has been declared mentally incompetent. She goes to Sears and buys a Contracts - Page 22refrigerator for $900. She has purchased 3 other refrigerators this week. Sears wants to enforce its contract against Jane. Can it? Example #3: Susan signed a contract with Better Bodies as part of her New Year's resolution to finally knock off some weight, but she's thought better of it now. Better Bodies has sued Susan in small claims co urt for money owed on the contract, but Susan claims that Better Bodies should not be allowed to enforce the contract. She says they used glitzy machinery and a cool smoothie bar to talk her into signing a contract when they know very well that 9 out of 10 people who sign up stop coming within 6 weeks. Susan says she was tric ked. Can Better Bodies enforce the contract? Example #4: Robbie Robber kidnapped Abe's sweet Petunia pug dog and demanded $1,000 for ransom. Not only did Abe pay, but he also sole mnly swore that he wouldn't cooperate in any prosecution of Robbie. Robbie says that because Abe breached the contract by going to the police after recovering Petunia, Robbie has been severely injured\u2014 he's out dog and money, and in jail! Abe doesn't disp ute that he broke his promise to Robbie. Does Robbie have a good case? Example #5: After showing Miranda several sheets of fine print and explaining them to her, Snidely closes the deal on a rental agreement by asking her to sign a rental contract that he has kept concealed until now that contains a very high rental fee, covering the contents with other papers and talking quickly so Miranda doesn't notice. Snidely has filed an action against Miranda, but she says she never laid eyes on the contract that bears her signature, and you believe her. Is the contract enforceable? [Look at pp. 10-12 fo r answers and discussion.] There are three other common reasons for a court to refuse to enforce a contract. Although they have legal-sounding names, they're pretty straightforward. As a general rule, these reasons are affirmative defenses, which means the defendant is responsible for bringing them to the attention of the judge and persuading the judge of their validity. The Statute of Frauds. Some contracts are required to be written, dated, and signed by the debtor to be enforceable. The ones you are likely to see most often ar e retail installment sales contracts when the seller is furnishing the buyer credit so that he can buy the goods or services. Contracts - Page 23The Stat ute of Limitations. There are legal time limits within which a person must bring a lawsuit or else lose the right to do so. There are three important rules that come up frequently in this defense: 1. The statute of limitations for contracts for services or money lent is three years. 2. The statute of limitations for contracts for the sale of goods is four years. 3. In an action on an account, a part payment starts the statute of limitations all over again on the balance due. Unconscionability. Remember when I said earlier that freedom of contract includes the right to make a bad deal? Sometimes a deal is SO bad, and the circumstances surrounding it are so troublesome, that the law refuses to enforce a contract. One judge described this kind of contract as one that \"shocks the conscience.\" When a contract is made between two parties who are very unequal in terms of their bargaining power and sophistication, and the contract itself strikes almost everyone as extremely unfair, the law simply refuses to lend its support and approval by enforcing it. Instead, the contract\u2014or often one or more of the terms of the contract\u2014 is labeled \"unconscionable\" and not enforced. What Are the D amages? Assume that you've determined a contract exists, iden tified its terms, and decided that the contract has been breached. How do you decide what to award the plaintiff? What is the measure of damages? General rule: Amount of money owed plus interest from date of breach. Special measure of damages in actions for breach of war ranty term: Difference between fair market value of goods received and goods as warranted. Interest: In all breach of contract actions, the law awards interest for the time period between the date of breech and the date of judgment. If the contract itself contains a rate of interest, that interest rate will apply (so long as it does not exceed the allowable rate under the law.) If the contract does not contain an interest rate, the rate is set by statute at 8% (sometimes referred to as \"the legal rate .\") Attorney fees are not usually allowed as part of damages. In the case of contracts, a notable exception includes action on a note or other evidence of debt. Amount is at contract rate up to maximum of 15% of outstanding balance, and there is a notice provision that allows debtor to avoid attorney fees by paying off debt. Contracts - Page 24Example : I buy a pure-bred puppy from Super Intelligent Pets. I tell the salesperson I want the smartest dog in the store, and he tells me about the special Doggy IQ Test that all their dogs must take before being matched with an equally smart owner. I agree to pa y $500 over a one-year period, with interest at 10%. I also agree that if SIP has to take me to court, I will pay an attorney fee of $200. After I take Einstein home, I discover he's dumb as dirt and I stop paying SIP. SIP sues me for breach of contract , and I counter-sue for breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Assume you rule in favor of SIP and against me on my counterclaim. W hat will the damages consist of? [I'm not looking for a specific amount of money \u2014just tell me in w ords what you'd be thinking about.] Assume you rule against SIP and for me. How will you determine damages? [Answers on p. 12.] Answers and Explanations Page 3 [Joint and seve ral liability]: Luna buys the furniture, signs the agreement, gets tired of Jane, and moves to Canada. Can the furniture store sue Jane? Answer : No. Jane did not enter into the agreement with the furniture store, so she was not a party to the contract. Just being married to Luna doesn't mean Jane is legally responsible for all her agreements. Page 3 [Conflicting evidence of terms of contract]: Joanna is suing for money owed, saying that she lent Tom $50 three months ago, and that Tom promised to pay her back \"within the next couple of months\" with interest but has never done so. Tom says he borrowed the money to buy textbooks for college, and that he and Joanna agreed that he would repay the loan at the end of this semester, when Tom begins working at his summer job. You're not sure who to believe. What do y ou do? Answer : Dismiss the case. When both parties are credible and the versions offered by each are plausible, the party with the burden of proof loses. Before you become too concerned that this result may be unfair to Joanna \u2014since she migh t be telling the truth, remember that she could have insisted on putting their agreement in writing. Page 4 [Determining contract terms ]: This time the folded sweaters on the table are variously colored and patterned. The clerk says, \"Would you like to p ick one out?\" and I respond, \"No, thanks. Just box one up for me.\" Can you conclude from this evidence that one term of the contract was that the sweater would be black? Contracts - Page 25Answer : No. Since the display was varied, and I refused to select a particular sweater, there is no evidence to support a finding that the color of the sweater was a term of this particular contract. Page s 4 & 5 [Parol evidence rule]: Luna and Sol sign a written agreement that says, \"I, So l, will pay Luna $50 for performing yard work on my yard. Luna will complete this work between the 1st and the 5th each month, and I will pay her upon completion.\" Question #1: Luna has brought an action for money owed against Sol after Sol refused to pay her. Sol says that's because Lu na didn't trim the shrubbery. Luna wants to introduce evidence that, at the time they negotiated the agreement, she asked Sol what he meant by \"yard work\" and Sol said, \"Mowing and raking the grass, edging the lawn, and using the weedeater in places where you can't get the mower.\" In this case, the judge can consider Luna 's testimony. Can you figure out why? Explanation : The term in the contract that refers to \"yard work\" is not clear\u2014 we don't know what the parties meant when they included that in the contract. Evidence about discussions they had before or at the time they negotiated the agreement may be considered by the judge in deciding what the term means. The judge may or may not believe Luna 's testimony, of course, but this is an example of a case when the parol evidence rule does not apply to prevent the judge from even hearing the evidence. Rule: Parol evidence is properly admitted to explain a term in the contract that is ambiguous. Question #2: In this situation, Luna and Sol have entered into the same written agreement, but this time Sol wants to testify that, two weeks after they signed the contract, he asked Luna to include trimming the shrubbery, and Luna agreed, with the understanding that the time for her performance would be increased from 5 days to 10. The judge can consider this testimony. Can you figure out why? Explanation: This evidence is not about the original agreement, but about a change in the agreement that happened later . Obviously, we can't expect later agreements (called modifications ) to be included in the original writing. The parol evidence rule applies only to evidence about events that happened before or at the same time as the contract. Page s 6 & 7 [Reasons not to enforce a contract ]: Example #1: Luna is 17 and looks 2 2. She bought a car from Fast Eddie, and she assured Fast Eddie that she's over 18. After she wrecks the car, she wants to return it, and get a complete refund of her money. Can she? Answer: Yes. Luna is a minor and had no legal ability to enter into this contract\u2014as far as the law is concerned, Luna can enforce it against Fast Eddie if she wants to, but she can also Contracts - Page 26change her mind and cancel the contract at any point. If this seems unfair to you, remember that one purpose of this law is to encourage adults like Fast Eddie think twice before entering into a contract with a young person who may not be mature enough to make a good business decision. Example #2: Jane is a quiet woman with a sweet smile who gives no outward sign that she suffers from Alzheimer's and has been declared mentally incompetent. She goes to Sears and buys a refrigerator for $900\u2014one of the less expensive ones on the sales floor. She has purchased 3 other refrigerators this week. Sears wants to enforce its contract against Jane. Can it? Answer : Maybe. We have a slightly different rule for contracts by people who are mentally incompetent, perhaps because the law realizes that, unlike young people, there may be no way for a merchant to tell if Jane is capable of giving legal consent. If Sears had no reason to know that Jane was incompetent, and there's no evidence that the contract was unfair or that Sears was taking advantage of Janet, courts will enforce the contract. Example #3: Susan signed a contract with Better Bodies as part of her New Year's resolution to finally knock off some weight, but like most of us, she's thought better of it now. Better Bodies has sued Susan in small claims court for money owed on the contract, but Susan claims t hat Better Bodies should not be allowed to enforce the contract. She says they used glitzy machinery and a cool smoothie bar to talk her into signing a contract when they know very well that 9 out of 10 people who sign up stop coming within 6 week s. Susan says she was tricked. Can Better Bodies enforce the contract? Answer : Yes. This is the classic example of a bad bargain. Susan was not deceived by Better Bodies; the company may not have provided her with facts about how many customers change their minds, but it is under no duty to do so. The law distinguishes between active deception and a passive failure to inform. This situation reminds us of the old saying: Let the buyer beware. Example #4: Robbie Robber kidnapped Abe's sweet Petuni a pug dog and demanded $1,000 for ransom. Not only did Abe pay, but he also solemnly swore that he wouldn't cooperate in any prosecution of Robbie. Robbie says that because Abe breached the contract, he's been severely injured\u2014 he's out dog and money, and IN jail! Abe doesn't dispute that he made the promise to Robbie, and agrees as well that he broke it. Does Robbie have a good case? Answer: I sure hope you said no. There are several problems with this contract, in addition to the main point of the question , which is that contracts made as a result of coercion or extortion are not enforceable. Neither are illegal contracts, of course. Finally, there was no real exchange here. Robbie gave up Petunia, but he had no right to her to begin wi th\u2014she belonged to Abe! Contracts - Page 27Example #5: After showing Miranda several sheets of fine print and explaining them to her, Snidely closes the deal on a rental agreement by asking her to sign a rental contract that he has kept concealed until now that contains a very high rental fee, covering the contents with other papers and talking quickly so Miranda doesn't notice. Snidely has filed an action against Miranda, but she says she never laid eyes on the contract that bears her signature, and you believe her. Is the contract enforceable? Answer: No. This is an example of a contract in which there was no real consent\u2014 Miranda's signature was obtained by a trick, and so it is not a meaningful sign that she agreed to this contract. Page 9 [Determining damages]: I buy a pure-bred puppy from Super Intelligent Pets. I tell the salesperson I want the smartest dog in the store, and he tells me about the special Doggy IQ Test that all their dogs must take before being matched with an equally-smart owner. I agree to pay $500 over a one-yea r period, with interest at 10%. I also agree that if SIP has to take me to court, I will pay an attorney fee of $200. After I take Einstein home, I discover he's dumb as dirt and I stop paying SIP. SIP sues me for breach of contract, and I counter -sue f or breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Assume you rule in favor of SIP and against me on my counterclaim. W hat will the damages consist of? [I'm not looking for a specific amount of money \u2014just tel l me in words what you'd be thinking about.] Answer: SIP is entitled to whatever portion of $500 I haven't yet paid, with 10% interest up to the date of judgment. In addition, assuming SIP properly gave me notice of its intent to seek attorney fees, I will have to pay attorney fees, but only up to 15% of the outstanding balance. Assume you rule against SIP and for me. How will you determine damages? Answer: Damages on a breach of warranty claim are determined based on the difference between the fair market value of Einstein as warranted and as she actually is. It will be my burden to prove to you the current fair market value of a super-intelligent puppy of Einstein's breed and the FMV of an ordinary dog of that breed. I will be entitled to that amount, plus interest of 8% (the legal rate, which applies unless a contract specifies a different rate) from the date of breach (which in this case would be the same as the date of sale). Contracts - Page 28Involuntary Commitment Mark Botts, Associate Professor (2009) Criteria for Involuntary Commitment in North Carolina Mental Illness (Adults) an illness that so lessens the capacity of the individual to use self -control, judgment, and discretion in the conduct of his affairs and social relations as to make it necessary or advisable for him to be under treatment, care, supervision, guidance, or control. Mental Illness (Minors) a mental condition, other than mental retardation alone, that so impairs the youth's capacity to exercise age- adequate self -control or judgment in the conduct of his activities and social relationships that he is in need of treatment. Substance abuse the pathological use or abuse of alcohol or other drugs in a way or to a degree that produces an impairment in personal, social, or occupational functioning. Substance abuse may include a pattern of tolerance and withdrawal. Dangerous to self Within the relevant past, the individual has: 1.acted in such a way as to show that a.he would be unable, without care, supervision, and the continued assistance of others not otherwise available, to exercise self -control, judgment, and discretion in the conduct of his daily responsibilities and social relations, or to satisfy his need for nourishment, personal or medical care, shelter, or self-protection and safety; and b.there is a reasonable probability of his suffering serious physical debilitation within the near future unless adequate treatment is given. Behavior that is grossly irrational, actions that the individual is unable to control, behavior that is grossly inappropriate to the situation, or other evidence of severely impaired insight and judgment creates an inference that the individual is unable to care for himself; or 2.attempted suicide or threatened suicide and there is a reasonable probability of suicide unless adequate treatment is given; or 3.mutilated himself or attempted to mutilate himself and there is a reasonable probability of serious self- mutilation unless adequate treatment is given. Previous episodes of dangerousness to self, when applicable, may be considered when determining the reasonable probability of serious physical debilitation, suicide, or serious self- mutilation . Dangerous to others Within the relevant past the individual has: 1.inflicted, attempted to inflict, or threatened to inflict serious bodily harm on another and there is a reasonable probability that this conduct will be repeated, or 2.acted in a way that created a substantial risk of serious bodily harm to another and there is a reasonable probability that this conduct will be repeated, or 3.engaged in extreme destruction of property and there is a reasonable probability that this conduct will be repeated. Previous episodes of dangerousness to others, when applicable, may be considered when determining the reasonable probability of future dangerous conduct. Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that an individual has committed a homicide in the relevant past is evidence of dangerousness to others.

Her husband report s that Molly has forgotten to turn off the stove t wo times in the last week, resulting in the burning of some pots and pans and a Formica countertop. Molly is extremely forgetful, frequently talks to the wall, and appears to be out of touch with her real surroundings. She has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (manic -depressive disorder). Is Molly dangerous to herself or others? Why or why not? 3. John goes downtown, hangs out on the main street sidewalk, blocks people from walking by, preaches loud words, and refuses to leave after being directed by the city police. John's brother says that John is religiously preoccupied, has ideas of persecution, and delusions of grandeur. John cannot understand why City Hall will not give him a license. John's brother is afraid that if John persists in trying to convert someone on the street who is resisting John's idea, then this person might become physically aggressive toward John. John's brother does not get any indication that John is aggressively motivated in the sense of being physically violent. John's brother has prepared a petition/affidavit for commitment for the magistrate. John's brother has written down in the petition the facts stated above and added that he believes John is in a mentally ill state of mind , is dangerous to himself or others, and needs medical treatment. Is John dangerous to himself or others? Why or why not? 4. Same facts as in number 3 , except the petitioner adds that John \"assaulted two people yesterday.\" Is John dangerous to himself or others? Why or why not? IVC - Page 95.Jane has been unemployed for almost one year, having left her job because she felt she was being harassed by married men at work. She has not attempted to seek other employment and has been living in her car for the past two weeks, despite the cold weather (December ). Jane believes that people are harassing her. Jane's daughter, Mary, was able to get her mother assessed by a physician who diagnosed Jane as suffering from psychotic depression, and possibly paranoid schizophrenia. The doctoralso noted to Mary that Jane was not eating well. Since t his initial evaluation two weeks ago, Jane has refused treatment and begun living in her car . Mary reports that her mother seems to have imaginary friends visiting her car, has a flat affect, andbelieves that others are \"harming her.\" Mary believes that her mother is incapable of providing for herself in her present state and is not getting sufficient nourishment.Mary says that Jane does not appear to have eaten much in the last two weeks and islosing weight. Jane apparently r uns the car engine periodically to keep warm . Mary fears that Jane might die of carbon monoxide poisoning if Jane continues to live inher car the rest of the winter.

Reasonable grounds to believe: The knowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable person of ordinary intelligence and prudence to believe. Reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent probably meets the commitment criteria: The knowledge of facts that would lead a reasonable person of ordinar y intelligence and prudence to believe the respondent probably meets the commitment criteria. For the magistrate or clerk to have reasonable grounds to believe, he or she must first have knowledge of facts that lead to that belief. To have knowledge of facts that would give reasonable grounds to believe, the affiant must assert facts (signs and symptoms) in the affidavit. Mere conclusions or opinions do not suffice to give the magistrate or clerk reasonable grounds to believe, for the magistrate cannot simply adopt the belief of others. Rather, the magistrate must come to his or her own belief based on facts asserted in the affidavit. IVC - Page 13 IVC - Page 14Mark Botts, Associate Professor (2009) What Happens After a Magistrate Issues a Custody and Transportation Order Source: Administration of Justice Bulletin, September 2007 Upon request, the magistrate or clerk of court has issued an order for custody and transportation of a person alleged to be in need of examination and treatment. This order is not an order of commitment but only authorizes the person to be evaluated and treated until a court hearing. The individual making the request has filed a petition with the court for this purpose and is, therefore, called the \"petitioner.\" The individual to be taken into custody for examination will have an opportunity to respond to the petition and is, therefore, called the \"respondent.\" If you are taken into custody, the word \"respondent,\" below, refers to you. 1. A law enforcement officer or other person designated in the custody order must take the respondent into custody within 24 hours. If the respondent cannot be found within 24 hours, a new custody order will be required to take the respondent into custody. Custody is not for the purpose of arrest, but for the respondent's own safety and the safety of others, and to determine if the respondent needs treatment. 2.Without unnecessary delay after assuming custody, the law enforcement officer or other individual designated to provide transportation must take the respondent to a physician or eligible psychologist for examination. 3. The respondent must be examined as soon as possible, and in any event within 24 hours, after being presented for examination. T he examining physician or psychologist will recommend either outpatient commitment, inpatient commitment, substance abuse commitment, or termination of these proceedings. Inpatient commitment : If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for inpatient commitment, the examiner will recommend inpatient commitment. The law enforcement officer or other designated person must take the respondent to a 24 -hour facility. Outpatient commitment: If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for outpatient commitment, the examiner will recommend outpatient commitment and identify the proposed outpatient treatment physician or center in the examination report. The person designated in the order to provide transportation must return the respondent to the respondent's regular residence or, with the respondent's consent, to the home of a consenting individual located in the originating county. The respondent must be released from custody. Substance abuse commitment : If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for substance abuse commitment, the examiner must recommend commitment and whether the respondent should be released or held at a 24 -hour facility pending a district court hearing. Depending upon the physician's recommendation, the law enforcement officer or other designated individual will either release the respondent or take him or her to a 24 -hour facility. Termination : If the examiner finds the respondent meets neither of the criteria for commitment, the respondent must be released from custody and the proceedings terminated. If the custody order was based on the finding that the respondent was probably mentally ill, then the person designated in the order to provide transportation must return the respondent to the respondent's regular residence or, with the respondent's consent, to the home of a consenting individual located in the originating county. 4.If the law enforcement officer transports the respondent to a 24 hour facility, another evaluation must be performed within 24 hours of arrival. This evaluator has the same options as indicated in step 3 above. If the respondent is not released, the respondent will be given a hearing before a district court judge within 10 days of the date the respondent was taken into custody.

Dangerous to others. - Within the relevant past, the individual has inflicted or att empted to inflict or threatened to inflict serious bodily harm on another, or has acted in such a way as t o create a substantial risk of serious bodily harm to another, or has engaged in extreme destruction of property; and that the re is a reasonable probability that this conduct will be repeated. Previous episodes of dangerousness to others, when ap plicable, may be considered when determining reasonable probability of future dangerous conduct. Clear, coge nt, and convincing evidence that an individual has committed a homicide in the relevant past is prima facie eviden ce of dangerousness to others. Dangerous to self. - Within the relevant past the individual has done any of the f ollowing: (1) acted in such a way as to show all of the following: (I) The individual would be unable w ithout care, supervision, and the continued assistance of others not otherwise available, to exercise self-control, judgm ent, and discretion in the conduct of the individual's daily responsibilities and social relations or to satisfy the individ ual's need for nourishment, personal or medical care, shelter, or self-protection and safety. (II) There is a reasonable probabil ity of the individual suffering serious physical debilitation w ithin the near future unless adequate treatment is given. A showing o f behavior that is grossly irrational, of actions that the individual is unable to control, of behavior that is grossly in appropriate to the situation, or of other evidence of severely impaired insight and judgment shall create a prima facie inference that the individual is unable to care for himself or herself. (2) The individual has attempted suicide or threatened suicide and that there is a reasonable probability of suicide unless adequate treatment is given. (3) The individual has mutilated h imself or herself or attempted to mutilate himself or herself and that there is a reasonable probability of serious self-muti lation unless adequate treatment is given. NOTE: Previous episodes of dangerousness to self, when applicable, may be cons idered when determining reasonable probability of physical debilitation, suicide, or self-mutilation. Health screening. - An appropriate screening suitable for the symptoms presented and within the capability of the entity, including ancillary services routinely available to the entity, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition exists. An emergency medical condition exists if an individual has acute symptoms of sufficient severity, including severe pain, such that the absence of immediate medical attention coul d reasonably be expected to result in placing the individual's health in serious jeopardy, serious impairment to bodily functi ons, or serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.

Brannon What is Involuntary Civil Commitment? Involuntary civil commitment is the process that the state, through its courts, uses to order a person who meets certain statutory cr iteria to obtain mental health treatment. The person ordered to receive treatment is called \"the respondent.\" Civil commitment is involuntary because the re spondent is ordered to submit to mental health treatment without his or her consent. When a respondent is involuntarily committed, the state has substituted its judgment about what is best for the respondent for the respondent's own judgment. This substituted judgment is a significant intrusion on the respondent's right to liberty, as is the involuntary commitment itself. Despite its intrusiveness, the commitment process before 1973 contained ve ry few safeguards to assure that the respondent was not arbitrarily deprived of freedom. Procedural due process was lacking insofar as a person could be committed for twenty days, without notice or a hearing, if a physician certified that the person was mentally ill or inebriate and dangerous to self or others. 1 Substantive due process was lacking in that a respondent could be committed for up to 180 days if, after an informal hearing, the clerk of court found that he or she was mentally ill or inebriate. The respondent did not need to be dangerous to self or others to be committed. 2 In 1973 the process was changed so that no respondent could be taken into custody without a hearing in which a magistrate found that the respondent was either mentally ill or \"inebriate\" (later changed to The author is a faculty member of the Sc hool of Government.

Th e state must show some dangerousness. \"A state cannot constitutionally confine without more a nondangerous individual who is capable of surviving safely in freedom by himself or with the help of a willing and responsible family members or friends.\" 4 Parts six, seven and eight of Article 5, Chapter 122C of the North Carolina General Statutes establish the procedures for involu ntary commitment. A brief overview of these procedures is set out below. Description of Commitment Process The statutory procedure for an involuntary commitment involves some or all of the following stages: The Petition for Commitment : A person who has knowledge of someone he or she believes needs mental health or substance abuse treatment petitions the magistrate to begin the involuntary commitment process. 5 (Petitions may also be presented to the clerk of superior court. Although this bulletin will refer to magistrates only, the same law and procedure applies if the petition is presented to a clerk.) This petition is an affidavit setting out facts intended to show that the respondent meets the statutory criteria for issuing an order (called a custody order) to take the respondent into custody for examination by a physician or eligible psychologist. Review of the Petition : The magistrate reviews the petition to determine whether reasonable grounds exist to find that the respondent meets the criteria for a custody order. 6 If the magistrate does not find reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent meets the criteria, the magistrate must decline to issue the order. Custody Order : If the magistrate does find reasonable grounds to conclude that the respondent meets the criteria for a custody order, the magistrate must issue an order to a law enforcemen t officer to take the respondent into custody and transport him or 3.

This hearing must occur within 10 days of the date the respondent is taken into custody by order of the magistrate. 16 At the hearing, if the court is persuaded by clear, cogent and convin cing evidence that the respondent meets the commitment criteria, it will order involuntary commitment. 17 The magistrate's role in the involuntary commitment process is a sm all but important one. Magistrates decide whether to issue orders to take respondents into custody for examination. Magistrates do not actually commit anyone; district court judges dete rmine whether to commit. The role of the magistrate as an independent and neutral judicial official determining whether to initiate the process for involuntary commitment is a safeguard to provide due process to a person before depriving that person of liberty as required by the United States Constitution. 18 The rest of this bulletin will focus on the magistrate's role in the process that potentially leads to involuntary commitment. Criteria For Issuing A Custody Order When a person (called the petitioner) appears before a magistrate to initiate the process of involuntary commitment, the magistrate must determine whether there are reasonable grou nds to believe that the respondent meets the statutory criteria for issuing a custody order. Reasonable grounds exist when, taking into consideration all the relevant information, a reasonable person would conclude that there is a fair likelihood that the respondent meets the criteria for a custody order. The \"reasonable commitment); 122C-286(h) (substance abuse commitment). 18. See In re Reed, 39 N.C. App. 227, 249 S.E.2d 864 (1978). standard is synonymous with the probable cause standard that magistrates use in issuing warrants.19 There are three situations in which a magistrate can issue a custody order: 1. The respondent is mentally ill and dangerous to self or others. 2. The respondent is mentally ill and needs court-ordered treatment to prevent further disability or deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerousness. 3. The respondent is a substance abuser and dangerous to self or others. 20 The first standard, mentally ill and dangerous, is the most complicated of the standards. Mentally Ill and Dangerous to Self or Others Under this standard the magistrate must draw two conclusions from the facts presented before issuing a custody order: first, that the respondent is probably mentally ill; and next, that the respondent is probably dangerous to self or dangerous to others. 21 Mentally Ill An adult respondent is mentally ill when his or her capacity to use self-control, judgment, and discretion in the conduct of his or her affairs and social relations has been so reduced by an illness that it becomes necessary or advisable for the respondent to be under treatment, care, supervisio n, guidance, or control. 22 A minor respondent is mentally ill when he or she has a mental condition, other than mental retardation alone, that so impairs his or her capacity to exercise age adequate self-control or judgment in the conduct of activities and social relationships that he or she needs treatment. 23 In both cases, the important features of mental illness are: (1) an illness (2) that impairs judgment and self-control and (3) makes treatment advisable. This is a legal standard, not a medical standard, and therefore does not require that the respondent have been diagnosed with a recognized mental illness by a physician or psychologist. Rather, 19.

G.S. 122C-3(21)(i). 23. 37Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 4 the magistrate must listen for facts that show that the respondent needs treatment because of a mental condition that is impairing his or her ability to make judgments or exercise self-control. In determining whether there are reasonable grounds to find that the respondent is mentally ill, a magistrate should look for conduct that is on the extreme ends of behaviors. Of course every person can, at times, engage in behavior that might be called extreme: a person can be so hostile that he slams the door in someone's face or so agitated that she drives off from the store with the grocery bags on top of her car. But in a respondent who is mentally ill, this behavior should go one step further: hostility may be taken to the point of attacking someone or anxiety may be manifested by a complete inability to carry on with the other functions of daily life. Also the extreme behavior is continuing rather than a one-time occurrence. The magistrate must examine the information provided about the respondent's behavior, movements, speech, motions and thoughts. For example, is the responden t seeing things that are not really there? Is the respondent in constant motion or is he totally quiet and apathetic? Appendix II at the end of this bulletin gives examples of the kinds of extreme behaviors that might indicate mental illness. If a magistrate determines that the respondent is probably mentally ill, the next step is to determine whether the respondent is probably dangerous to self or others. Dangerous to Self A petitioner can show that the respondent is dangerous to self in three different ways: Respondent is unable to care for himself or herself, is suicidal, or has engaged in self-mutilation. Respondent is unable to care for self The first way of proving dangerousness is by showing that, within the relevant past, the respondent has been unable to care for himself or herself and as a result is likely to suffer serious physical debilitation in the near future if treatment is not given. 24 Magistrates should note that although the appellate cases cited in this bulletin are instructive, they are based on evidence presented at the district court hearing where the standard of proof\u2014clear, cogent, and convincing evidence\u2014is significantly higher than the reasonable ground s determination that the magistrate must make. The requirement that the behavior have occurred within the \"relevant past\" 24. G.S. 122C-3(11)a.1. does not mean that the behavior must have occurred within the \"recent past.\" There is no specific time within which the past behavior must have occurred to be relevant. (The concept of \"relevant past\" is discussed more thoroughly below at page 7.) The test for finding that the respondent is unable to care for self has two prongs and both must be satisfied before issuing a custody order. First, the magistrate must determine that the respondent has acted in such a way as to show that he or she probably would be unable, without care, supervision, and the continued assistance of others not otherwise available, to exercise se lf-control, judgment, and discretion in the conduct of daily responsibilities and social relations, or to satisfy the need for nourishment, personal or medical care, shelter, or self-protection and safety. Put more simply, the first prong requires the magistrate to find that the respondent probably would be unable to care for himself or herself in regard to daily affairs without treatment. For example, a respondent, who required anti-psychotic medication but refused to take it, would not eat properly, and refused recommended outpatient treatment was found dangerous to himself. Failure to care for medi cal, dietary, and grooming needs meets the test of dangerousness to self, the court said. 25 On the other hand, unusual eating habits alone may not show dangerousness to self. The North Carolina Court of Appeals was hesitant to find that a respondent who fasted for a time, then ate a whole chicken or loaf of bread, and also ate about five pounds of sugar every two days was dangerous to himself. 26 If the respondent seems unable to care for his or her daily needs, the magistrate must go on to make a second, more specific, finding that this inability to care for self creates a probability that the respondent will suffer serious physical debilitation within the near future. In the example above, where the respondent's dietary habits were irregular, the court noted that it could not find a likelihood of serious debilitation because the state had presented no evidence of the effect of the irregular diet on the respondent, or any evidence on how long he had been eating that way. 27 The result might have been different if the respondent was diabetic. On the other 25. In re Lowery, 110 N.C. App. 67, 428 S.E.2d 861 (1993). 26. In re Monroe, 49 N.C. App. 23, 270 S.E.2d 537 (1980). The decision was an appeal from the district court's commitment so the standard of proof that was not met was clear, cogent and convincing rather than the magistrate's standard of reasonable grounds. 27. Id. at 29, 270 S.E.2d at 540. IVC - Page 38September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 5 hand, where a petitioner presented evidence that the respondent had been living in her car for two weeks during the winter, had been unemployed for the last year, having left her job because she felt she was being harassed, and had no plans for earning income, and that her only means of subsistence was food brought by the petitioner, the court found that the respondent was at risk of serious physical debilitation. 28 In determining the reasonable probability of future dangerous conduct, the magistrate may consider previous episodes of dangerousness to self.29 If the petitioner presents evidence that the respondent's behavior is grossly irrational, that the respondent is unable to control his or her actions, that the respondent's behavior is grossly inappropriate to the situation, or that the respondent's insight and judgment are severely impaired, the magistrate may presume that the respondent probably meets this second prong. 30 To summarize, a magistrate may find a respondent dangerous to self if the respondent seems unable to take care of his or her daily needs and is likely to suffer serious physical debilitation in the near future if he or she does not receive treatment. However, the respondent cannot be found dangerous to self merely because he or she behaves in a way that may provoke others to harm him or her. For example, a respondent who was not physically violent herself, but who aggressively preached on the street corner, trying to convert all passersby, was not dangerous to herself merely because someone who reacted negatively to her conversion attempt might react in a way that is physically harmful to her. 31 Respondent is suicidal A respondent also can be dangerous to self if he or she has attempted or threatened suicide and there is a reasonable probability of suicide unless the respondent receives adequate treatment. 32 The magistrate may choose to treat an attempt at suicide, alone, as sufficient evidence that there is a reasonable probability of suicide. The magistrate also may treat a threat of suicide as grounds for issuing a custody order and leave the determination of whether there is 28. In re Medlin, 59 N.C. App. 33, 295 S.E.2d 604 (1982). The finding that the respondent was mentally ill was not disputed. 29. G.S 122C-3(11)a. 30. G.S. 122C-3(11)a.1.II. 31. In re Hogan, 32 N.C. App. 429, 232 S.E.2d 492 (1977). 32. G.S. 122C-3(11)a.2. a future likelihood of suicide to the examiners. Whether a statement constitutes a threat of suicide will depend on the respondent's history and the context in which the statement was made: for example, a statement like \"I could kill myself\" probably is not a threat of suicide when it comes from a person who has just done something enormously embarrassing, but it may be when it comes from someone who has suffered a dramatic loss of some kind. Respondent has engaged in self-mutilation The third way to show a respondent is dangerous to self is to prove that he or she has mutilated or attempted to mutilate himself or herself and that serious mutilation is likely to occur again unless the respondent is committed. 33 No North Carolina appellate cases have discussed this ground for commitment. Self-harm or self-injurious behavior is fairly prevalent today, 34 particularly among adolescents and may include burning, biting, cutting, head banging, picking at skin, pulling out hair, bruising. But some self-harm, while needing treatment, does not rise to the level of self-mutilation necessary for involuntar y commitment, and the magistrate must be careful to distinguish between the two. The involuntary co mmitment statute requires that the magistrate find that serious self-mutilation is likely to occur unless the respondent is committed. Therefore, the frequency and the severity or seriousness of the injury is critical. The magistrate should also look at other factors such as the reason for the self-harm, whether the respondent has access to weapons to do serious harm, and the progression of seriousness of the injuries. One case from another state in which the facts show ed dangerousness to self based on self-mutilative behavior indicated that the patient had a history of cutting himself, injuring 33. G.S. 122C-3(11)a.3. 34. About one percent of th e United States population uses physical self-injury as a way of dealing with overwhelming feelings or situ ations, but the problem is more prevalent among teenagers where an estimated ten percent have experimented with self-mutilation.

IVC - Page 39Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 6 himself very seriously to the point that he required blood transfusions.35 Dangerous to Others A magistrate must also i ssue a custody order for a mentally ill respondent if he or she is dangerous to others. A respondent is dangerous to others if, within the relevant past, he or she has: (1) inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another, or has acted in a way that creates a substantial risk of serious bodily harm to another, or has engaged in extreme destruction of property, and (2) there is a reasonable probability that such conduct will be repeated. 36 Respondent has inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another Most cases coming before a magistrate probably will be fairly clear cut as to whether the respondent inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another person. But what if the respondent has only threatened to inflict serious bodily harm on another? Is the threat a sufficient basis for finding that the respondent is dangerous to others? Courts addressing the issue have concluded that overt dangerous actions are not necessary to conclude that a respondent is dangerous to others. For example, a respondent who threatened his aged and nervous mother and family with increasing frequency over several weeks, saying he was going to \"get you all,\" in conjunction with evidence that he believed his family had sexually seduced him and that he appeared ready to fight any time one of them said something to him, led the court to conclude that the respondent was dangerous to others. 37 In another case, a respondent was found dangerous to others based on evidence that he kept an iron pipe and hatchet under his bed and, through threats, had kept his mother in one chair, unmoving, while he screamed, shouted, cursed, and threatened to \"bust\" her head if she called anybody. 38 A respondent who had threatened many people in the neighborhood and 35. In re Best Interest of M.G. 2002 WL 31854887 (Tex. App.-Tyler 2002) 36. G.S. 122C-3(11)(b). 37. In re Monroe, 49 N.C. App. 23, 270 S.E.2d 537 (1980). 38. In re Collins, 49 N.C. App. 243, 271 S.E.2d 72 (1980). had threatened to cut her brother's throat was found dangerous to others.39 In order to find a respondent dangerous to others on the basis of threats alone, however, the petitioner must present specific evidence about the kind of harm the respondent thr eatened, when the threats were made, and in what context. For example, the mere allegation that the \"respondent ha[d] made statements to her husband of a threatening nature,\" without more, is insufficient.40 One issue that sometimes troubles magistrates is commitment of persons who are residing in nursing homes. For example, a resident of the nursing home who suffers from dementia or bipolar disorder becomes violent and attacks another resident of the nursing home and the nursing home staff seeks to have the resident involuntarily committed. The fact that the respondent is in a nursing home or the fact that the respondent suffers from dementia should not result in any different decision by the magistrate. If the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to believe the respondent is mentally ill (i.e., has an illness\u2014and dementia and Alzheimer's disease are mental illnesses--that impairs judgment and self-control and makes treatment advisable) and is dangerous to self or others, the magistrate should issue a custody order. Respondent's behavior creates a substantial risk of serious harm There are no reported North Carolina cases that have addressed a respondent whose actions, though not intended to inflict serious bodily harm on another, have nonetheless created a substantial risk of serious harm. Some situations, of course, will be clear cut: if the respondent, while playing with matches, sets fire to an occupied twenty-unit apartment building in the middle of the night, the respondent's behavior creates a substantial risk of serious harm. Other cases will require a judgment call: if the respondent has a habit of digging man-sized holes in a field near his house, whether or not such conduct creates a substantial risk of serious harm depends on the depth of the holes, the amount of pedestrian traffic in the field, and the visibility of the holes to pedestrians who do walk in the field. If the field sees significant pedestrian traffic, and the respondent artfully covers the holes 39. In re Jackson, 60 N.C. App. 581, 299 S.E.2d 677 (1983). This respondent had also cut her brother's hand within the last week, but the court did not discuss the seriousness of this cut or its role in the determination that she was dangerous to others. 40. In re Holt, 54 N.C. App. 352, 354, 283 S.E.2d 413, 415 (1981). IVC - Page 40September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 7 with grass, the holes may create a substantial risk, but if the holes are only two inches deep, they may not create a risk of serious physical harm. Respondent has engaged in extreme destruction of property The one reported case in No rth Carolina dealing with dangerousness to others based on engaging in extreme destruction of property emphasized the \"extreme\" requirement. In that case the respondent had used a hammer to break everything she could find in her house, including the television, the telephone, and all available glass. 41 Reasonable probability of dangerous behavior being repeated Unlike the second prong of the dangerousness to self test, the second prong of the dangerousness to others test\u2014a reasonable probability that the dangerous behavior will be repeated\u2014has not been emphasized in court cases. The stat ute provides that the magistrate may consider previous episodes of dangerous behavior in determining future probability of dangerous conduct. 42 Therefore, as long as the magistrate finds past acts of dangerousness this prong is satisfied. Within the relevant past The tests for dangerousness to self and others share the requirement that the respondent's allegedly dangerous behavior has occurred within the relevant past. This requirement is no different than the requirement of relevance in evidence law, generally. That is, any information that tends to make the existence of a material f act more or less likely is relevant. 43 In the context of involuntary commitment, the respondent's behavior occurred within the relevant past if the behavior makes it more or less likely that the respondent is dangerous to self or others at the time commitment is considered. \"[The] acts are relevant because they occurred close enough in time to the district court [or magistrate's] hearing to have probative value on the ultimate question before the court of whether there was a 'reasonable probability that such [violent] conduct [would] be 41. In re Williamson, 36 N.C. App. 362, 244 S.E.2d 189 (1978). There was also evidence that the respondent threatened to physically injure family members. 42. G.S. 122C-3(11)b. 43. G.S. 8C-1, Rule 401. repeated.'\"44 So, for example, if the petitioner presents information that the mentally ill respondent, now thirty years old, went through a period when she was ten where she would only eat dirt, the behavior probably did not occur within the relevant past. The concept of within the relevant past does not depend solely on the passage of time, however, but on the totality of the circumstances as the petitioner presents them. For example, the petitioner presents evidence that the mentally ill respondent tried to kill his brother three years ago after refusing to take medication prescribed for his mental illness. This information may seem remote in time. However, if the petitioner supplements this evidence with the information that the mentally ill respondent has once again stopped taking his prescription medication and is exhibiting symptoms similar to those that preceded the three-year-old incide nt, that three-year-old evidence may have occurred within the relevant past. Although most information the magistrate hears will probably not be this remote, the important thing to remember is that there is no bright-line in time beyond which information is no longer relevant. In fact, one of the problems the General Assembly wanted to cure in changing the language of the standard from \"within the recent past\" to \"within the relevant past\" was the practice of some judicial officials of setting a specific limit on the time frame for the conduct. 45 Summary The magistrate must issue a custody order when he or she finds reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent is probably mentally ill and dangerous to self or others. Mental illness has three elements: (1) an illness (2) that impairs judgment and self-control (3) to a degree that makes treatment or supervision advisable. A respondent is dangerousness to self if he or she: (1) is unable to care for self and there is a reasonable probability of serious physical debilitation in the near future or (2) has attempted or threatened suicide and there is a reasonable probability of suicide or 44. Davis v. N.C. Dep't of Human Res., 121 N.C. App. 105, 115, 465 S.E.2d, 2, 8 (1995) 45. See Joan Brannon \"Mental Health,\" N ORTH CAROLINA LEGISLATION 1989 at 127 (Institute of Government 1990). IVC - Page 41Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 8 (3) has mutilated, or attempted to mutilate, himself or herself and there is a reasonable probability of serious self-mutilation. A respondent is dangerous to others if (1) he or she has: (a) inflicted or attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another or (b) acted in a way that creates a substantial risk of serious bodily harm to another or (c) engaged in extreme destruction of property and (2) there is a reasonable probability that such conduct will be repeated. Mentally Ill and in Need of Treatment Even if a mentally ill respondent is not dangerous to self or others, a magistrate still must issue a custody order if the respondent, based on his or her psychiatric history, is in need of treatment to prevent further disability or deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerousness.46 Mental illness in this context means the same thing as mental illness in the inpatient commitment context: (1) an illness (2) that impairs judgment and self-control (3) to the extent that treatment or supervision is advisable. Although this standard (unlike the mentally ill and dangerous to self or others standard) does not specifically require the petitioner to show that within the relevant past the respondent has engaged in, attempted, or threatened to engage in conduct that is dangerous to self or others, such evidence seems necessary to show a psychiatric history indicating that deterioration leading to dangerousness is likely. That is, psychiatric history that would make dangerous deterioration predictable is bound to be a history of past instances in which the respondent did become dangerous. For example, if the petitioner presents evidence that the respondent has stopped taking her antipsychotic medication and states that the lack of medication will make the respondent dangerous, this statement alone probably is not sufficient grounds to issue a custody order: it should be supported by information that when the respondent has gone off her medication in the past she has done, attempted, or threatened to do, something dangerous. Involuntary Commitment of Mentally Retarded Respondents 46. G.S. 122C-261(b). Special rules apply in issuing custody orders for mentally ill persons who are also mentally retarded. A mentally retarded respondent may be involuntarily committed only if he or she meets one of the standards set out above; that is, the respondent must be mentally ill and dangerous to self or others or must be mentally ill and in need of treatment to prevent deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerousness. 47 It is often difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether the dangerous behavior is caused by the mental retardation or mental illness, If the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to believe the respondent is mentally ill as well as mentally retarded and if the magistrate finds dangerousness to self or others, the magistrate should issue the commitment or der and leave it to the professionals to determine whether involuntary commitment is appropriat e for the respondent. Moreover, a mentally retarded person cannot be admitted to a state psychiatric hospital unless the respondent is so extremely dangerous as to pose a serious threat to the community and to other patients in a non-state hospital or is so gravely disabled by both multiple disorders and medical fragility or deafness that alternative care is inappropri ate. In both of those situations the determination of whether the respondent meets the criteria for commitment to a state psychiatric hospital is made by the Local Management Entity for the area where the respondent resides or is found. 48 If a respondent is mentally retarded, the petitioner must produce facts indicating this on the petition, and the magistrate must specifically note it on the custody order. \"Mental retardation\" is defined as \"significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with deficits in adaptive behavior and manifested before age 22.\" 49 Making such a diagnosis is beyond the knowledge of lay petitioners and magistrates alike and should be left to the professional examiner. However, the petition must 47. G.S. 122C-261(b). In Thomas S. v. Flaherty, 699 F. Supp. 1178 (W.D.N.C. 1988) a federal district court held that North Carolina was inappropriately confining and treating mentally ill retarded persons in the state psychiatric hospitals and ordered the state to provide a full range of habilitative treatment for mentally retarded persons confined in state psychiatric hospitals. The requirement limiting admission to state hospitals was enacted in 1995 in response to that case. See Joan Brannon, 1996 Legislation Amending the Involuntary Commitment and Domestic Violence Laws, A DMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE MEMORANDUM No. 96/04 at 1. 48. G.S. 122C-261(f). 49. G.S. 122C-3(22) (1996). IVC - Page 42September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 9 include facts indicating me ntal retardation. Four questions can help a magistrate determine whether the respondent is probably mentally retarded: (1) Has a doctor or psychologist ever said that the respondent has mental retardation? (2) Has the respondent ever been in special education classes for st udents with mental retardation? (3) Has the respondent ever received special services for respondents with mental retardation such as sheltered workshops or group home placement? (4) Did the problems relating to intelligence and functioning begin before age 22? In order to find the respondent mentally retarded, the answer to the fourth ques tion must be \"yes\" and at least one of the other three questions must also be answered in the affirmative.50 The special provisions regarding mentally retarded persons do not apply to substance abuse commitments. Substance Abuse Commitment Magistrates may also be asked to issue custody orders for respondents who are substance abusers. The standard for issuing a custody order in these circumstances is: (1) the respondent is a substance abuser who is (2) dangerous to self or others.51 Substance abuse means the pa thological use or abuse of alcohol or other drugs in a way, or to a degree, that produces an impairment in personal, social, or occupational functioning; it may include a pattern of tolerance and withdrawal. 52 The use does not need to have occurred over any certain length of time or in any certain amount. To be pathological the use need only be habitual or compulsive and have a negative impact on the respondent's functioning. Such functional impairment might mean, for example, that the respondent misses important meetings at work because of alcohol or drugs, verbally abuses friends and family members when drunk, or suffers delusions when she has gone too long without drugs or alcohol. A magistrate who finds that the respondent is probably a substance abuser and is dangerous to self or others must issue a custody order. The standard for assessing danger to self or others is the same as described under the standard for inpatient commitment of persons with mental illness. 50. Brannon, supra note 47 at 2-3. 51. G.S. 122C-281. 52. G.S. 122C-3(36). Unlike the definition of mental illness, this definition is a medical one. Procedure for Initiating Involuntary Commitment To begin the process of involuntary commitment a person must petition for an order (the custody order) to have the respondent picked up for examination by a physician. Petitioning for a custody order differs in several significant ways from the usual small claims court procedure. First of a ll, the procedure is not a trial; it is merely a mechanism to have the respondent taken into custody for examination. Petitioning for a custody order is an ex parte hearing: that is, the hearing takes place without notice to, or the presence of, the opposing party\u2014in this case, the respondent. The respondent normally is not present, but even if respondent is present, the usual procedure for presentation of evidence is not followed. The respondent is not part of the process and does not present evidence in his or her favor or get to cross examine the petitioner or petitioner's witnesses. Also, two fundamental rules of evidence are not followed in petitioning for involuntary commitment. First, the petitioner is deemed a competent witness even in cases where he or she has no personal, firsthand, knowledge of the respondent's state. This departure from the rules of evidence leads to the second, which is that a petitioner can prove his or her case, and the respondent may be taken into custody and transported for examination, entirely on the basis of hearsay evidence. 53 In this last respect, hearing a petition for a custody order is like the probable cause determination in issuing criminal process. Who may initiate a petition? Anyone with information about the respondent may petition for a custody order..54 The respondent's family members or friends, neighbors, social workers, teachers, physicians or law enforcement officers can all be petitioners. The petitioner's knowledge of the respondent's condition does not have to be firsthand; hearsay information about the respondent is acceptable. For example, a law enforcement officer may petition for a custody order on the basis of information told to him or her by the respondent's neighbor, or a respondent's sister may petition based on information from the respondent's mother. In this respect, the petition resembles an application for a warrant: hearsay evidence can be considered, but at the trial of the matter before a 53. In re Zollicoffer, 165 N.C. App. 462, 598 S.E.2d 696 (2004). 54. G.S. 122C-261(a), -281(a). IVC - Page 43Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 10 district court, the witness must have personal knowledge of the facts a bout which he or she is testifying. Who is subject to a custody order? Any person may be subject to a custody order (assuming the petitioner presents sufficient evidence), no matter his or her age. Involuntary commitment of minor children may occur less frequently than of adults because parents (or guardians) are given the power to consent to treatment for their minor children and can have them admitted to treatment without showing dangerousness. Involuntary commitment thus generally occurs only when a child's parents do not consent to treatment, the parents cannot be found, or because of the child's dangerousness, the parents believe it is best to involuntarily commit the child. However, if the petitioner presents sufficient facts to commit a minor, the magistrate cannot refuse to issue a custody order for a minor simply because the parent could seek a voluntary admission. Where is the petition initiated? Petitions may be made to a magistrate in the county where the respondent lives or in the county where the respondent is found. 55 For example, if a resident of Cabarrus County is found wandering the streets of downtown Charlotte without proper clothing, speaking to imaginary friends, either a magistrate in Cabarrus County or a magistrate in Mecklenburg County is authorized to issue a custody order for the respondent and the petitioner can go to either place. Most often the petition is brought in the county where the respondent is found. A respondent who is found in North Carolina need not be a resident of the state to be involuntarily committed. A Mecklenburg County magistrate could also issue a custody order for a resident of South Carolina who is found in Mecklenburg County. 56 How is a petition made? 55. G.S. 122C-261(a), -281(a). 56. If a resident of anot her state is involuntarily committed in North Carolina, the State psychiatric hospital may return the respondent to his or her home state. G.S. 122C-345. Personal Appearance Most petitioners must appear personally before the magistrate to execute the petition.57 The magistrate may have the petitioner fill out the petition or may complete it for the petitioner after the petitioner has conveyed the relevant facts about the respondent's condition. Either way, the petitioner must swear to the facts contained in the petition. An unsworn petition cannot serve as the basis for issuance of a custody order. 58 Physician or Psychologist Petitioner One group of petitioners does not have to personally appear before the magistrate: when the petitioner is a physician or eligible psychologist59 who has examined the respondent, he or she may execute an affidavit before any official authorized to administer oaths (usually a notary public) and submit the affidavit to the magistrate by delivering the original to the magistrate or sending a copy by telefacsimile transmission.60 The physician or psychologist examiner need not appear before the magistrate to testify, but the magistrate must have the notarized affidavit or a faxed copy of it in front of him or her and make a determination from the facts contained in the affidavit that the resp ondent meets the custody order criteria. Because the physician's or psychologist's evaluation must comply with the requirements of an initial examination, the physician or psychologist petitioner frequently will attach a form called \"Examination and Recommendation to Determine the Necessity for Involuntary 57. G.S. 122C-261(a), -281(a). 58. In re Ingram, 74 N.C. App 579, 328 S.E.2d 588 (1985). 59. There is a pilot progr am operating in several western Local Management Entities (LMEs) allowing the initial evaluation to be performed by a licensed clinical social worker, a masters level psychiatric nurse or a masters level certified addictions specialist in addition to a physician or eligible psychologist. In those LMEs when these clinicians perform the initial evaluation, they are treated like physicians and eligible psychologists and do not have to personally appear before the magistrate when they are the petitioner. 60. G.S. 122C-261(d). A similar provision for transmission by telefacsimile is not included in the substance abuse statute. However, since the procedure could be followed without a statutory provision, it can be followed in substance abuse commitments also. IVC - Page 44September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 11 Commitment\"61 to the affidavit and the facts may be stated in the attachment. If the affidavit is submitted by telefacsimile transmission, the physician or psychologist must mail the original no later than five days after transmission to the clerk or magistrate to be filed in the case file. Sometimes rather than mailing the original, the physician or psychologist will give it to the law enforcement officer who comes to the physician or psychologist to take the respondent into custody under the order. Petition Must Show Facts The \"Affidavit and Petition for Involuntary Commitment\" (AOC-SP-300) is a sworn affidavit setting forth facts that show that the respondent meets at least one of the standard s for issuance of a custody order. The magistrate must issue a custody order if the petition shows that the respondent is probably: (1) mentally ill and dangerous to self or others; (2) mentally ill and in need of treatment to prevent deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerousness; or (3) a substance abuser who is dangerous to self or others. The petition must set forth facts in support of petitioner's allegations and not just conclusions. Facts are assertions or statements about something having objective reality\u2014an actual event in time or space. Conclusions are judgments. Statements in a petition such as \"the respondent lacks self-control and is unable to provide for himself\" or \"the respondent is a mentally ill ... person who is dangerous to [her]self or others [and] [r]espondent has strange behavior and irrational in her thinking\" 62 are conclusions. An example of a statement of facts is: \"For the past two weeks the respondent has been hallucinating, claiming that an escaped convict is after him and that his wife is secretly keeping the convict in the basement of their home. On three occasions between April 23 and 25 he threatened to shoot his wife if she does not get rid of the convict. On April 26, the respondent purchased a gun, shot his wife in the arm, and told her that she had three days to get the convict out of the house.\" The facts stated in the petition must support all the criteria necessary for a custody order. The statement of facts above, for example, establishes that the respondent is probably mentally ill (hallucinating, claiming that an escaped convict is conspiring with his wife), that he inflicted serious physical harm on someone (shot his wife), and that there is a likelihood 61. The form number is DMH 5-72-01 (Sept. 2001). 62. In re Ingram, 74 N.C. App. 579, 581, 328 S.E.2d 588, 589 (1985). such conduct will be repeated (past behavior and still hallucinating indicates conduct likely to reoccur); this statement of facts supports a finding that the respondent is mentally ill and dangerous to others. But recall the example of the mentally ill respondent who fasted for days at a time and then ate a whole loaf of bread or a chicken, and ate five pounds of sugar every two days. While this statement of facts may have supported a finding that the respondent was unable to care for himself, it did not show that he was in danger of serious physical debilitation, as required to find the respondent mentally ill and dangerous to himself. The following petition also was found to be insufficient to allege mental illness and dangerous to self: \"Respondent has strange behavior and irrational in her thinking. Leaves home and no one knows of her whereabouts, and at tim es spends the night away from home. Accuses her husband of improprieties.\" 63 An example of a sufficient petition based on respondent's danger to self is: \"Respondent stopped taking her psychiatric medicine (Haldol) three weeks ago. She has begun having trouble sleeping at night and hasn't slept more than one hour in the past 48 hours. She hasn't bathed for a week and has been talking constantly for the last week even though normally she is a quiet person. Last night when it was 25 degrees outside, I found her walking around in the back yard in a short-sleeved shirt saying she was looking for her mother, who died fifteen years ago.\" A petition adequate to obtain a custody order for a substance abuser might be the following: \"The respondent has been smoking crack cocaine three times daily for the last two weeks; he lost his job two days ago when he showed up at work high and now that he has no income of his own to buy drugs today he beat his mother and fath er to steal their money.\" When a respondent is mentally retarded as well as mentally ill, the petition might allege (in addition to facts necessary to support the other required elements for commitment) something to the effect that the respondent was identified as mentally retarded when she was in second grade and has been receiving special education services for the mentally retarded since that time. It is not clear whether it is necessary to allege facts regarding the mental retardation since that is not a criteria for commitment, but rather a special provision that affects the choice of hospitals for the respondent. However, since the statute requires the magistrate to find that \"the respondent is also probably mentally ill\" 64 the safest practice is to include facts supporting that finding. 63. Id. 64. G.S. 122C-261(b). IVC - Page 45Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 12 Magistrate's Role in Ascertaining Facts Asking Questions A petitioner who appears before a magistrate seeking a custody order is often in a state of crisis. Due to this emotional state and the fact that the petitioner is probably not acquainted with the custody order criteria, the magistrate may have to actively participate in getting information from the petitioner and in writing the petition. The magistrate should always feel free to ask specific questions necessary to determine whether to issue a custody order. Common questions to ask might include: 1. Has the respondent harmed or threatened to harm self or others within the past 24 hours? Within the last week? Month? Three months? a. What did the respondent do to himself or herself? b. What did the respondent do to you? c. What did the respondent do to others? 2. Is the respondent hallucinating (seeing or hearing things that other people don't)? What kind of things is he or she hearing or seeing? 3. Can the respondent identify the day, where he or she is, his or her name or age? 4. Does the respondent have unreasonable thoughts that people are talking about him or her or are going to kill or hurt him or her? Tell me what he or she said, or how you learned this information?. 5. Is the respondent making exaggerated or elaborate claims, such as: a. being on a special mission; b. being another important and powerful person; c. being part of a powerful organization? 6. Does the respondent have trouble sleeping at night? How long since the respondent had a normal night's sleep? 7. Has the respondent consumed more than one pint of alcohol per day for the past three to ten days? 8. Is the respondent taking any medication? a. what is it? b. has the respondent taken any illegal drugs within the past 24 hours? Month? Three months? What kind of drug? How much? 9. Has there been any change in the respondent's appetite? Has it grown or decreased? Is the respondent eating at all? 10. Is the respondent doing his or her normal activities? If not, what is the respondent doing differently? 11. Is the respondent unable to care for self because of his or her mental condition? Is he or she eating, sleeping, dressing, bathing, using the toilet, staying out of traffic? Writing Down All the Relevant Facts The magistrate must make sure that the petition itself contains all the facts about a respondent's present condition as well as information about previous episodes of dangerousness that are relevant to determining that there is a reasonable probability of future dangerous conduct or that would show the current deterioration would predictably result in dangerousness if treatment is not provided. 65 The facts must support all the bases for commitment that are checked on the order. For example, if the respondent is mentally ill and dangerous to self, the facts must support each of these prongs. If there is not enough space for this information on the petition itself, the magistrate should attach an extra sheet. Full detail is important for two reasons: First, the district court judge is likely to dismiss the case if the petition is lacking in detail to support a custody order. 66 \"[A custody] order is essentially a judgment by which a person is deprived of his liberty ..., and as a result, he is entitled to the safeguard of a determination by a neutral officer of the court that reasonable grounds exist for his original detention....\" 67 Even if the petitioner is a physician or psychologist, the petition must state sufficient facts to support the issuance of a custody order. Giving too much deference to physicians or psychologists, who are required to give facts like other petitioners, may result in the case being dismissed and is an abdication of the magistrate's role as an independent judicial official determining reasonable grounds to proceed. 65. G.S. 122C-261(a), -281(a). 66. In re Ingram, 74 N.C. App. 579, 328 S.E.2d 588 (1985). 67. In re Reed, 39 N.C. App. 227, 229, 249 S.E.2d 864, 866 (1978). IVC - Page 46September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 13 Second, because the physician or psychologist who examines the respondent may not speak to anyone besides the respondent, the petition must convey to the examiner the respondent's current state and past history. Denying The Custody Order If, after hearing the petitioner, the magistrate does not find reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent meets one of the custody order standards, the magistrate must not issue a custody order. In this circumstance, the magistrate does not have to fill out a petition (in those cases where the petitioner has not filled out his or her own petition) and is not required to make written findings of fact. The magistrate should give the petitioner the information necessary to contact the local mental health center and pursue whatever treatment options the respondent will voluntarily accept. Issuing The Custody Order A magistrate who does find reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent meets one of the custody order standards must issue a custody order. Where the statutory criteria for is suing a custody order are met, the magistrate should issue a custody order even if the respondent, either in person or via the petitioner, agrees to submit to treatment voluntarily. The reason for this result is this: it is possible that the respondent, because of mental illness or substance abuse, may not have the capacity to consent to treatment. Whether the capacity to consent does exist is a determination that should be left to the professional examiner and, if the respondent has capacity to consent, the examiner may convert the involuntary commitment to a voluntary admission. In a case from Florida the respondent agreed to hospitalization but later claimed that he was deprived of his liberty without due process because he didn't have the mental capacity to understand his consent. He successfully claimed that the hospitalization should have occurred under the involuntary commitment process where he would have been afforded the due process safe guards inherent in that procedure. 68 The bottom line is that if a respondent meets the custody order criteria, the magistrate should issue the order. 68. Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed. 2d 100 (1990). The kind of order the magistrate issues will depend on who the petitioner is. When the Petitioner is Not a Physician or Psychologist When the petitioner is not a physician or eligible psychologist, the magistrate will use the form entitled \"Findings and Custody Order Involuntary Commitment\" (AOC-SP-302). Findings In issuing the order itself the magistrate must first make \"findings\" of fact. The order contains three possible findings: (1) the respondent is mentally ill and dangerous to self or others or in need of treatment to prevent deterioration that would predictably lead to dangerousness; (2) the respondent, in addition to being mentally ill, is also mentally retarded; or (3) the respondent is a substance abuser and dangerous to self or others. The magistrate should check all that apply, and it is possible that all three could apply. The magistrate, however, may only check the mental retardation box [box (2)] if the respondent is also mentally ill and that box was also checked. If the respondent is a substance abuser and also mentally retarded, there is no similar requirement to make findings concerning mental retardation. Order Under the order the magistrate should check the block that directs \"any law enforcement officer\" to take the respondent into custody and take the respondent for examination by a person authorized by law to conduct the examina tion (block 1). The officer must take the respondent to an area facility 69 for examination; if a proper person to perform the examination is not available in the area facility or no facility is available, the officer takes the respondent to any physician or psychologist locally available, 70 which typically is the emergency department of the nearest general hospital. If the initial examiner recommends inpatient commitment, the order directs a law enforcement officer to transport the respondent to a designated 24-hour facility for a second examination. 69. An \"area facility\" is a facility operated by or under contract with an area mental health authority. G.S. 122C- 3(14). 70. G.S. Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 14 When the Petitioner is a Physician or Psychologist When the petitioner is a physician or psychologist71 who has already examined the respondent and has made a specific recommendation as to the respondent's disposition and the magistrate finds reasonable grounds supporting the recommendation, then the order the magistrate issues depends on the examiner's recommendation for disposition, which is found in Section III of \"Examination and Recommendation to Determine Necessity for Involuntary Commitment\" (DMH 5-72-01). If the examination form is not attached and the physician has not specified the type of commitment\u2014mentally ill and dangerous; mentally ill and in need of treatment; or substance abuser and dangerous\u2014the magistrate must determine which type of commitment the facts support. When the physician or psychologist recommends inpatient commitment If the physician or psychologist petitioner recommends inpatient commitment and the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to affirm that recommendation, the magistrate must issue the regular custody order (AOC-SP-302), make the appropriate finding, and ch eck the box in the order directing the law enforcement officer to transport the respondent directly to a designated 24-hour facility for examination and custody pending a district court hearing (box 2). 72 There is no need to take the respondent to a local examiner because the physician or psychologist petitioner has already performed that examination. When the physician or psychologist recommends outpatient commitment If the physician or psychologist petitioner recommends outpatient commitment and the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to affirm the recommendation, the magistrate does not issue a custody order because th e respondent will not be taken into custody. Rather, the magistrate issues the order entitled \"Findings and Order Involuntary Commitment Physician-Petitioner Recommends Outpatient Commitment\" (AOC-SP-305), which requires hearing a district court judge to hold a hearing to determine whether the respondent will be 71. See supra note 59. 72. G.S. 122C-261(d). involuntarily committed to outpatient treatment.73 The clerk will issue a notice of hearing to the respondent.74 Outpatient commitment means treatment in an outpatient setting and may include medication, individual or group therapy, day or partial day programming activities, services and training including educational and vocational activities, supervision or living arrangements, and any other services prescribed either to alleviate the individual's illness or disability, maintain semi-independent functioning, or to prevent further deterioration that may reasonably be predicted to result in the need for inpatient commitment to a 24-hour facility. 75 When the physician or psychologist recommends substance abuse commitment If the physician or psychologist petitioner recommends substance abuse commitment and the magistrate finds reasonable grounds to affirm that recommendation, the type of order issued by the magistrate depends upon the recommendation of the physician or eligible psycho logist as stated in the \"Examination and Recommendation\" form. 76 If the physician recommends that the respondent be held at a 24-hour facility, the magistrate issues a custody order to transport the respondent directly to the designated 24-hour facility for examination and custody pending a district court hearing AOC-SP- 302, block 2). If the physician recommends that the respondent be released pending a hearing, the magistrate issues an order that a hearing before a district court judge be held to determine whether the respondent will be involuntarily committed (AOC- SP-305). Designate the 24-Hour Facility To Which Respondent Taken In the final part of the first page of the custody order, the magistrate must fill in the name of the designated 24-hour facility77 to which the respondent may be 73. Id. 74. The form is \"Notice of Hearing/Rehearing for Involuntary 5-72-01. 77. Under G.S. 122C-252 hospita ls must be designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Resources to receive and treat involuntarily committed respondents. Any facility IVC - Page 48September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 15 taken if the first examiner finds that the respondent is an appropriate candidate for inpatient commitment or if the petitioner is a physician or psychologist who recommends inpatient commitment. Note that the magistrate does not put the place for the officer to take the respondent to the first evaluation (in other words the mental health center or local hospital emergency room) in this block. The form and statute require that the magistrate put the designated 24-hour facility to which the respondent will be taken for the second evaluation and at which he or she will be held for a district court hearing. The Department of Health and Human Services maintains a list of designated 24-hour facilities on its website at http: //www/ ncdhhs.gov/mhddsas/ ivc/ ivcdesignatedfacilities_6-14-07.pdf. In order to ensure that the respondent will be admitted to any designated 24-hour facility (state psychiatric hospital or local public or private hospital that has been designated by the State to take involuntary commitments) to which he or she might be taken, the magistrate should name the 24-hour facility to which most respondents are sent and then put \"any designated 24-hour facility,\" (e.g. \"Broughton Hospital or any designated facility\"). Some magistrates merely put \"any designated 24-hour facility\" without naming any specific facility. Private Hospital Placements A respondent who has the resources to pay for the cost of inpatient hospital care without the use of any public funds may select a private facility for treatment and care. In those cases where the respondent is able to choo se a private placement, the petitioner must have already have made arrangements with the chosen facility and if it is clear that the private facility has agreed to accept the respondent, the magistrate should fill in the name of that facility on the order. 78 If the family has not made prior arrangements for admission to a private facility, the magistrate should send the respondent to the usual designated could take the respondent, but private hospitals may not take indigent respondents. 78. G.S. 122C-263(d)(2) implies that direct commitment to a private hospital is appropriate when it provides that if the first examiner recommends inpatient commitment, \"the law enforcement officer ... shall take the respondent to a [designated] 24-hour facility.... If there is no area 24-hour facility and if the respondent is indigent and unable to pay for care at a private 24-hour facility, the law enforcement officer ... shall take the respondent to a State facility for the mentally ill....\" 24-hour facility and the Local Management Entity or facility staff can transfer a respondent who qualifies for admission to a private hospital. Requirement to Contact Area Authority Before Issuing Custody Order In two different circumstan ces, the magistrate must contact the local mental hea lth center before issuing a custody order. First, in cases where the magistrate has found that the respondent is probably mentally retarded, in addition to being mentally ill, he or she must contact the area author ity (local mental health center) before issuing any order. 79 When the petitioner is not a physician or an eligible psychologist, the area authority will tell the magistrate where to take the respondent for the initial and second examinations. The magistrate should indicate to the officer wher e to take the respondent for the first evaluation and should write the location of the second evaluation in the block on the form \"name of 24-hr. facility for mentally ill.\" When the petitioner is a physician or eligible psychologist, the area authority will designate the 24-hour facility to which the respondent should be taken and the magistrate should write this location down on the order in the block for the 24-hour facility for mentally ill. In the event that a mentally retarded person gets beyond the magistrate without the petitioner asserting and the magistrate finding that the person is mentally retarded and the mental retardation is discovered at the first evaluation, the examiner at the first evaluation can fill in a non-state facility in the box designated \"or following facility designated by area authority.\" Second, some counties have local policies that require the magistrate to contact the local mental health center before issuing a custody order. If the chief district court judge has approved the policy, it should be followed by the magistrates. Who Serves the Custody Order When the magistrate issues a custody order, generally a law enforcement officer serves the order. City police officers are responsible for transportation to a location within the county if the respondent resides, or was taken into custody, within city limits. If the respondent resides, or was taken into custody, in the county but outside city limits, the county deputy sheriffs are responsible fo r transportation, including 79. G.S. 122C-261(b). IVC - Page 49Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 16 transportation to locations outside the county.80 This statute is confusing if a respondent resides in the city but is found in the county outside the city limits or vice versa since in those situations both the police and sheriff are designated to transport for evaluations within the county. The local law enforcement agencies must determine which agency transports in those circumstances. There are two situations where persons other than law enforcement officers may provide transportation under a custody order. The city or county may designate volunteers or other personnel to provide transportation rather than using law enforcement officers. 81 The persons designated by the city or county follow the same procedure as law enforcement officers. Magistrates may authorize family members or immediate friends of the respondent to carry out the custody order if the following criteria are met: first, a family member or immediate friend must make a request to transport the respondent; and second, the magistrate must find that the respondent does not pose substantial danger to the public. 82 The critical word is \"substantial\" since all respondents must be dangerous. For example the second criterion might be met in a case where the respondent is an older person who has been found dangerous to self because he is unable to care for himself but becomes extremely agitated when dealing with law enforcement officers. If the magistrate authorizes transportation by a family member or friend, in addition to completing the custody order, the magistrate must also complete the form entitled \"Request and Authorization to Deliver Respondent\" (AOC-SP-902M). The magistrate should inform the family member or friend providing the transportation where to take the respondent for the initial evaluation and where to take the respondent for the second evaluation if necessary (which is the 24-hour facility designated by the magistrate on the custody order). The magistrate also should inform the person that he or she must return to the clerk of court the form entitled \"Request and Authorization to Deliver Respondent\" with the acknowledgement of delivery filled in and the \"Custody Order\" with the \"preliminary examination\" section filled in. Validity 80. G.S. 81. G.S. 122C-251(g). 82. G.S. 122C-251 (f). The magistrate's custody order directs any law enforcement officer to ta ke the respondent into custody and transport him or her as directed in the order within 24 hours afte r the order is issued and without unnecessary delay after assuming custody. 83 If the respondent is not taken into custody within 24 hours of issuance of the order, the order is no longer valid and the officer may not take the respondent into custody after that time. Wh at is not clear is the procedure that must be followed if the respondent is not taken into custody within 24 hours and the petitioner still wishes to commit the respondent. One possibility is for the magistrate to issue a second custody order based on the first petition. The other course of action would be to require the petitioner to present evidence of the respondent's continued dangerousness in a new petition and issue a new order based on that petition. The procedure the magistrate follows may depend on the nature of the facts presented in the first petition. Some facts would support the issuance of a custody order even though one or more days might have passed since anyone has seen the respondent and since the issuance of the custody order. Other facts may present a weaker case with the passage of a day or more. If at the time the request for a new custody order is made, the magistrate determines that the facts alleged in the first petition lead the magistrate to find reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent now meets the criteria for commitment, th e magistrate can issue a second order based on the first petition. 84 Where is the order valid? For example, what if a respondent moves back and forth between counties? As long as the custody order was issued by an appropriate magistrate\u2014one sitting in a county where the respondent either resided or was found\u2014it can be served on the respondent anywhere in North Carolina. 85 The only difficulty with service is a practical one of getting the order to the appropriate law enforcement agency in the county where the respondent is to be taken into custody. Generally, an officer from the magistrate's county delivers the order to the appropriate ag ency. Although there are no cases or statute governing the situation, it probably is sufficient for the officer holding the original custody order to fax a copy of the order and petition to a law enforcement agency in the county where the respondent is now believed to be found for service. 83. G.S. 122C-261(e), -281(e). 84. There are no reported cases in North Carolina dealing with this issue. 85. G.S. 122C-261(e), -281(e). IVC - Page 50September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 17 Inform Petitioner of Next Steps If the magistrate issues a custody order for a mentally ill respondent, the magistrate must provide the petitioner (and respondent, if present) with information regarding the next steps in the process. 86 Although the statute containing this requirement does not enumerate specific pieces of information that should be relayed, the magistrate should inform the petitioner that: (1) the custody order is a document that initiates the process leading to commitment; it is not the commitment order itself; (2) the respondent will be taken into custody by a law enforcement officer and taken to a local facility to be examined by a physician or psychologist who will make one of three recommendations: (a) release the respondent because he or she does not meet the commitment criteria; (b) release the respondent but schedule a district court hearing within 10 days because the respondent meets the criteria for outpatient commitment; (c) take the respondent to a 24-hour facility because he or she meets the criteria for inpatient commitment. (3) if the second examiner recommends inpatient commitment, the respondent will be held at the 24-hour facility for observation and treatment pending a district court hearing to be held within 10 days. The facility staff must release the respondent when he or she no longer meets the criteria for involuntary commitment. A model notice of next steps is found at Appendix III at the end of this bulletin. 87 Inquiry Into Respondent's Indigence Upon issuing a custody order for inpatient commitment, the magistrate is required by law to inquire as to whether the respondent is indigent (and thus entitled to have appointed counsel at the district court hearing).88 However, many magistrates no longer make this inquiry because indigent respondents who are sent to a state psychiatric 86.

G.S. 122C-261(c), -281(c). hospital are entitled to receive representation from the special counsel and in that situation determining whether a respondent is indigent is the responsibility of the special counsel.89 At hearings for mentally ill persons in counties other than where state hospitals are located, counsel is appointed for indigent respondents in accordance with the rules adopted by the Office of Indigent Defense Services. 90 However, even if a mentally ill respondent is not indigent, but refuses to retain counsel, the Office of Indigent Defense Services must appoint counsel for him or her anyway.91 Therefore, for most mentally ill respondents counsel is going to be appointed so a magistrate's determination of indigence is unnecessary. For substance abuse respondents, the statute provides that the clerk of c ourt, upon direction of the district court judge, assigns counsel 92 who represents the respondent at the trial level, and upon appeal the Office of Indigent Defense Services appoints counsel. 93 Respondents who are recommended only for outpatient treatment (that is, those who are not at a state psychiatric hospital) do not have the right to counsel at their district court hearing. However, a judge may appoint counsel for an indigent respondent who is recommended only for outpatient commitment if the judge determines that the issues involved in the outpatient commitment are of significant complexity or that the respondent is unable to speak for himself or herself. 94 Magistrates who do conduct an indigence inquiry should use the form \"Affidavit of Indigency,\" AOC- CR-226. Emergency Commitments In addition to the regular procedure for initiating an involuntary commitment, there are two emergency procedures for circumstan ces where the respondent requires immediate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others. 89. G.S. 122C-270(a). 90. G.S. 122C-270(d). Currently the judge or clerk the appointments. G.S. 122C-268(d). 51Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 September 2007 18 Emergency Commitments for Mentally Ill Magistrates are not involved in emergency commitments of mentally ill respondents. The criteria for the special emergency procedure is that the person not only meet the criteria for a regular commitment but also that person is in need of immediate hospitalization to prevent harm to themselves or others. The emergency commitment procedure allows anyone, including law enforcement officers, to take the respondent directly to a local physician or psychologist or directly to a State facility for examination. 95 If the examiner finds that the respondent is, in fact, (1) mentally ill, (2) dangerous to self or others, and (3) in need of immediate hospitalization, the examiner will send sworn certification of this finding to the clerk of superior court on the form entitled \"Supplement to Support Immediate Hospitalization\" (DMH 5-72-01- A). This supplement must accompany the examiner's usual examination form (\"Examination and Recommendation To Determine Necessity for Involuntary Commitment,\" DMH 5-72-01). 96 The certification takes the place of the magistrate's custody order and requires a law enforcement officer to transport the respondent to a 24-hour facility for a second examination. If a person comes to the magistrate with an evaluation by a physician and the additional supplement certifying the need for immediate hospitalization, the magistrate should not issue a custody order but should indicate to the law enforcement officer that the certificate takes the place of a custody order. Emergency Commitment of Substance Abusers The special procedure for emergency commitment of substance abusers does involve magistrates. Only law enforcement officers may petition for emergency commitment of substance abusers. If a substance abuser is violent and requires restraint, and if delay in taking him or her to a physician or eligible psychologist for examination would probably endanger life or property, the law enforcement officer may take the substance abuser into custody and take 95. G.S. 122C-262. 96. Both forms are needed because the examiner must give facts supporting the mental illness and dangerousness as well as the need for immediate hospitalization, and the certificate for emergency commitment does not require facts supporting the mental illn ess and dangerousness. G.S. 122C-262(b), -264(b1). him or her immediately before a magistrate to seek a custody order.97 If magistrate finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence (note that this evidentiary standard is higher than that required in the non- emergency case) that (1) the facts in the affidavit are true, (2) that the respondent is in fact violent and in need of restraint, and (3) that delay in taking the respondent to a physician or eligible psychologist would endanger life or property, the magistrate must issue an emergency commitment order to take the respondent directly to a 24-hour facility, bypassing the first examination. The form is entitled \"Petition for Special Emergency Subs tance Abuse Involuntary Commitment Petition and Custody Order\" (AOC-SP-909M). Transportation Orders In addition to issuing custody orders that require officers to transport the respondent for examination in response to a petition for involuntary commitment, magistrates may order law enforcement officers to provide transportation in two other situations. First, if a substance abuser who is under an order for outpatient treatment fails to comply with that order, the area mental health authority or supervising physician may, after reasonable efforts to solicit the respondent's compliance, ask the magistrate to order that the respondent be taken into custody and transported to the area authority or physician for examination. 98 Also if a substance abuser who has been discharged from inpatient commitment and breaches the conditions of his or her release, the area mental health authority or physician may request that the respondent be taken into custody and transported to the area authority or physician for examination.99 Upon request, the magistrate must issue an order a law enforcement officer to transport the respondent to a designated physician for examination. The form is \"Request for Transportation Order and Order (Committed Substance Abuser Fails to Comply With Treatment or Is Discharged From 24-Hour Facility)\" (AOC-SP-223). The second situation in which the magistrate may be asked to issue a custody order is where transportation is needed to transfer certain respondents from one 24-hour facility to another. 100 In this situation, a respondent being held for a district court hearing or already comm itted by a district court 97. G.S. 99. Id. 100. G.S. 122C-206(c1). - Page 52September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 19 judge needs to be transferred from the 24-hour facility in which he or she is being held to another 24-hour facility. Frequently this occurs when the respondent was sent to a local hospital but that hospital is unable to handle the respondent and wants the respondent sent to a state psychiatric hospital. The magistrate may also be asked to transfer a minor or incompetent adult who was voluntarily admitted from one facility to another. If a responsible professional at the original facility notifies the magistrate to issue an order, the magistrate must order a law enforcement ag ency to transfer the respondent. The form is \"Notice of Need For Transportation Order and Order (From One 24-Hour Facility to Another)\" AOC-SP-222. Conclusion After a magistrate has issued an order to take a respondent into custody and transport him or her for examination, the magistrate's involvement in the process of involuntary civil commitment ends. From this point the respondent is examined by two professionals and, if these examinations reveal that the respondent meets the cr iteria for commitment, the respondent will receive a hear ing in the district court, at which time the judge may commit the respondent.

Page 56September 2007 Administration of Justice Bulletin 2007/05 23 Appendix III Steps Following the Issuance of a Custody Order for Involuntary Commitment Upon request, the magistrate or clerk of court has issued an order for custody and transportation of a person alleged to be in need of examination and treatment. This order is not an order of commitment but only authorizes the person to be evaluated and treated until a court hearing is held. The individual making the request has filed a petition with the court for this purpose and is, therefore, called the \"petitioner.\" The individual to be taken into custody for examination will have an opportunity to respond to the petition and is, therefore, called the \"respondent.\" If you are taken into cust ody, the word \"respondent,\" below, refers to you. G.S. 122C-261(b) requires that the petitioner and the respondent, if present, be informed of the next steps that will occur for the respondent. 1. A law enforcement officer or other person designated in the custody order must take the respondent into custody within 24 hours. If the respondent cannot be found within 24 hours, a new custody order will be required to take the respondent into custody. Custody is not for the purpose of arrest, but for the respondent's own safety and the safety of others, and to determine if the respondent is in need of treatment. 2. Without unnecessary delay after assuming custody, the law enforcement officer or other individual designated to provide transportation must take the re spondent to a physician or eligible psychologist for examination. 3. The respondent must be examined as soon as possibl e, and in any event within 24 hours, after being presented for examination. 4. Upon examination, the physician or psychologist w ill recommend either outpatient commitment, inpatient commitment, substance abuse commitment, or termination of these proceedings. Inpatient commitment: If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for inpatient commitment, the examiner shall r ecommend inpatient commitment. The law enforcement officer or other designated person shall take the respondent to a 24-hour facility. Outpatient commitment: If the examiner finds the respondent meets the criteria for outpatient commitment, the examiner will recommend outpatient commitment and identify the proposed outpatient treatment physician or ce nter in the examination report. The person designated in the order to provide transportation must return the respondent to the respondent's regular residence or, with the respondent's consent, to the home of a consenting individual located in the originating county. The respondent shall be released from custody. Substance abuse commitment: If the examiner find s the respondent meets the criteria for substance abuse commitment, the examiner shall recommend commitment and whether the respondent should be released or held at a 24-hour facility pending a district court hearing. Based on the physician's recommendation, the law enforcement officer or other designated individual shall take respondent to a 24-hour facility or release the respondent. Termination: If the examiner finds the respondent meets neither of the criteria for commitment, the respondent must be released from custody and the proceedings terminated. If the custody order was based on the finding that respondent was probably mentally ill, then the person designated in the order to provide transportation must return respondent to the respo ndent's regular residence or, with the respondent's consent, to the home of a consenting indivi dual located in the originating county. 5. If inpatient treatment is recommended, the law enforcement officer transports the respondent to a designated 24 hour facility where another evaluation must be performed within 24 hours. This evaluator has the same options as indicated in step 4 above. If th e evaluator determines that the respondent needs inpatient treatment, the respondent is admitted to the facility for care and treatment. 6. The inpatient treatment provider must release the respondent when in the provider's professional opinion the respondent no longer meets commitment criteria. If the respondent is not released, the respondent will be given a hearing before a district court judge within 10 days of date respondent taken into custody. The hearing is usually held in the county where the 24-hour facility is located unless the respondent request a hearing in the county where the petition was initiated.

Acts that are part of\u2014or connected to\u2014the current or ongoing incident, episode, or situation that help you assess what is happening and what is likely to happen if adequate treatment is not given. Dangerous to Self The individual gets up 3 to 6 times a night and has unusual eating habits (sometimes fasts, sometimes eats a whole loaf of bread or whole chicken in one sitting, eats about 5 lbs. of sugar every couple of days by drinking sugar dissolved in water). Is the individual dangerous to self?10 11 12 IVC - Page 625 Dangerous to Self A two prong test that requires a finding of: a lack of selfcare ability regarding one's daily affairs, and a probability of serious physical debilitation resulting from the more general finding o f lack of selfcaring ability.

There are a few legal concepts, though, that are good to know about, if only because there is so much misinformation floating around. Tree Law General rule: A person who owns property is required to use reasonable care to avoid injury to adjoining prope rty by unsound trees on the owner's property. A property owner is not liable for damage caused by \"an act of God,\" however, meaning injury that was not foreseeable. Similarly, a property owner must use reasonable care to avoid injury caused by trees on his or her property falling on to public roads. The owner is not liable, however, if the owner had no notice of the danger. An owner may be said to have \"notice\" if the evidence shows the owner should have known of the condition --including the situation in which an agent of the owner was informed of the condition -- even if the evidence falls short of establishing actual knowledge on the part of the owner. Rights of adjoining landowners: NC has not decided a case raising this issue, but cases from other jurisdictions are uniform in holding that a landowner has the right to trim branches or roots extending over his or her land, and that a landowner has no right to enter his neighbor's property for the purpose of cutting down his neighbor's tree. Beyond th at, courts ha ve established varying rules for resolving these disputes. Negligent Children: Children under the age of seven are incapable of being negligent as a matter of law. Children between 7 and 14 are presumed incapable of negligence, but that presumption may be rebutted by a showing that the child acted in a way that is careless even when compared to other children of the same age. When children cause injury to person or property, whether negligently or intentionally, the child's parent(s) may be found responsible because of the parent's own negligence as a parent (negligent supervision). NC law makes parents responsible for injury to person or property deliberately caused by their children, up to a maximum of $2,000 . Page 2Vicarious Liability: In some circumstances, the law holds a person responsible for torts committ ed by someone else. The most common examples are: A employer may be held responsible for the negligent acts of an employee. The legal owner of a car may be held responsible for the negligence of the driver, if the owner is a passenger in the car. The l egal owner of a car may be held responsible for the negligence of a driver who is a member of the driver's household, even if the owner is NOT a passenger in the car. Is a husband responsible for the negligence of his favorite suit to the dry cleaners, but when he went to pick it up, the suit was a better fit for his five -year -old than it was fo r him. He brings an action in small claims court, alleging that the dry cleaner's negligence resulted in his property becoming worthless. The dry cleaner defends as follows: 1. \"John hasn't introduced any evidence that I was negligent. In fact he hasn't introduced any evidence at all that I ever touched the suit.\" What do you think? _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________ ____________________________ 2. \"On the pick -up ticket \u2014and on a big sign in the store \u2014we say that we're not responsible for damage to property left for cleaning.\" What do you think? __________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ Torts - Page 33. \"John dropped off a cheap suit with a tag plainly stating, \"Hand wash only.

Connie doesn't have the money to pay the entire purchase pric e, though. So FF offers to sell her the furniture on an installment plan\u2014in other words, to \"finance\" her purchase. Of course, there's a possibility that Connie will take the furniture but not finish paying for it. If that happened, FF coul d certainly sue Connie for breach of contract. But there's a good chance that Connie might turn out to be \"judgment-proof,\" and even if she isn't, it would involve a lot of effort and expense on FF's part to collect. An alternative, which helps FF feel more secure, and thus more interested in selling to low-income customers, is for FF and Connie to enter into another contract saying that if Connie misses a payment, FF can repossess the furniture. FF doesn't even have to come to court, un less its effort to retrieve the furniture might cause a breach of the peace. As you know, a business deal is often referred to as a transaction, and this special type of two-contracts-in- one is called a __________________ ______________________. To create a secured transaction, the debtor must sign a written, date d ___________________ _________________that describes the property involved specifically enough so that it may be identi fied. The parties to this agreement are Connie, the debtor, and FF, the _________________ ___________________. The property that secures the transaction is called _______________________ . Rather than saying that FF and Conn ie entered into a security agreemen t in which FF obtained the right to repossess the collateral if Connie doesn't pay, it 's easier to simply say that FF took a ________________ _______________ in the property. The legal term for Connie's failure to pay, which triggers FF's right to repossess, is _____________________. The rules about what FF does after repossessing the prop erty are complex.

Recovering Personal Property - Page 8Rights of Third Parties SP may be able to repossess property from 3rd parties if SP has a perfected security interest. Perfection may occur in four ways: By filing financing statement with Secretary of State. A purchase money security interest is automatically perfected. In the case of motor vehicles, by filing a lien with DMV. Creditor retains posses sion of property (e.g., pawnbroker) Priority rules for perfected security interests: Purchase money security interest prevails over all others. First to perfect wins otherwise. Perfected interest wins over unperfected interest. Special rule for consumer goods A \"good faith purchaser\" of consumer goods who purchases from a buyer takes free of a security interest in the goods if The GFP did not know there was a security interest in the goods; The GFP paid for the goods; The goods were for the GFP's persona l use; the goods before a financing statement was filed.

Womble Furniture Co. instituted a civil action on July 1, 2014 to recover a dining room table, six chairs, one couch, a cocktail table and an upholstered wing chair. At the trial, Womble introduces a written security agreement signed on April 5, 2012 in which defendant agreed that the items listed would be collateral for the extension of credit for their purchase on that day from Womble. Womble indicates that the defendant defaulted on March 1, 2014 and asks for judgment to recover all of the items listed. Defendant does not contest that he defaulted, but states that he only owes $300 and the items Womble seeks to recover are worth more than $300. He wants you to limit your judgment to recover the dining room table and chairs only since they are worth more than $300. How do you rule and give your reasons. 2. Fantas tic Furniture Co. brings an action to recover possession of a dining room suite sold to Samuel and Sarah Sand. At the trial the manager of Fantastic Furniture Co. testifies that he sold the furniture and that the Sands entered into an oral agreement to use furniture as collateral for the debt. He then introduces his account record, which shows a default by the Sands. How do you rule and why? 3. ABC Appliance Co., a secured party, brings an action to recover possession of a refrigerator against Simon Sam pler. The magistrate entered a judgment in favor of ABC Appliance Co. Two months later ABC Appliance Co. brings an action to recover deficiency indebtedness . Simon Sampler counterclaims against ABC Appliance Co. for failure to conduct sale in a commerciall y reasonable manner. At the trial ABC Appliance Co. proves that upon recovering refrigerator, he sold it to an employee for $150. ABC Appliance proves that $200 was owed on the debt when the refrigerator was repossessed and that the company's expenses in s elling the refrigerator was $50. ABC Appliance asks for a judgment of $100. Simon Sampler says that ABC Appliance gave him notice by calling him two hours before the sale was to take place and that the sale was not held in a commercially reasonable manne r. He asks for $90 damages (10% of the principal amount of the loan plus the interest charges) for failure to conduct the sale in a commercially reasonable manner. How do you rule and why on ABC's claim and Simon's counterclaim? 4. Abe Barker calls Sam's Heating and Cooling and asks to have them deliver and install a window unit. Sam's Heating and Cooling comes out to his house installs the unit and then sends a bill to Barker for $300, the cost of the unit and installation. Barker d oes not pay the bill; Sam's Heating and Cooling brings an action to recover possession of the air conditioning unit as a nonsecured plaintiff. At the trial Sam's proves the facts stated above; Barker is not present. How do you rule and why? 5. Easy Credi t Appliance Co. filed a civil action on July 1, 2014 to recover a refrigerator purchased on June 1, 2008 ; a clothes dryer purchased on June 1, 2009 ; a VCR purchased on June 1, 2010; a television set purchased on June 1, 2011, and a washing machine purchase on June 1, 2012. As each item was purchased, the buyer signed a security agreement listing the item just purchased and all the items previously purchased as security for the debt. The buyer defaulted on his payments on March 5, 2014. Easy Credit asked for a judgment to repossess all of the items listed as collateral. The defendant argued that he had been paying $75 on the contract since 2008 and he believed Easy Credit was not entitled to recover all of the items listed since he must have paid off some of the first items purchased.

Present day law is a mixture drawn from three sources, each with its ow n historical development, primary goals, and interests to be protected. Property law Consumer protection law Contract law Landlord/Tenant - Page 3The unique remedy of summary ejectment is available only in cases involving \"a simple landlord tenant relationship\" AND only for four specific breaches Breach of a lease condition for which reentry is specified. Failure to pay rent Holding over Criminal activity The most important aspect of making correct decisions in summary ejectment actions is identifying the grounds and then applying the rules associated with that ground. Breach of a lease condition for which reentry is specified No matter what the complaint say s, it works best to begin in ev ery case by determining whether the lease contains a forfeiture clause (i.e ., a lease condition for which reentry is specified). The analysis for this ground works like this: Ask the plaintiff whether th e lease is oral or written. If written, require that a copy of the lease be placed into evi dence. Read the lease for language prov iding in essence that a consequ ence of breach may be termination of the lease. Key words are right of reentry and default, but neither may be used. Identify the trigger for forfeiture. Determine whether the plaintiff has demonstrated that tenant's behavior triggered forfeiture. Determine whether plaintiff strictly complied with any procedur al requirements for declaring forfeiture set out in the lease. (For example, notice requirement.) _ Landlord/Tenant - Page 4Failure to pay rent What if there is no forfeiture clause? If the landlord has no contractu al right to end the lease because of tenant's breach, the general rule is that a landlord's only remedy is money damages caused by the tenant's behavior. If the partic ular breach is failure to pay r ent, however, NC law throws the landlord a life prese rver (confusingly) identified a s Failure to Pay Rent. The General Assembly passed a law specifically targeting a situ ation in which a tenant is occupying property, not paying rent, and refusing to leave by creating a statutory procedure allowing the landlord to eject the tenant i f all efforts to obtain payment fail. This ground is only available if there is no forf eiture clause in the lease. To qualify for this statutory exception to the general rule, the landlord must make a demand that the tenant pay rent and must give the tenant at least ten days from the date of demand before filing an action for s ummary ejectmen t. The landlord has the burden of showing compliance with this requirement as part of a prima facie case. If the tenant is able to come up with all money owed and court costs at any time prior to entry of judgment (\" tender\"), the tenant is entitled to have the action for SE dismissed. Holding over AKA \"The lease has ended, but the tenant's still there!\" There are three ways a lease can end: (1) The parties agree at the beginning on the enddate (\"This lease for one year begins on Sept. 1, 2011, and ends on August 31, 2012.\") (2) The parties agree at the beginnin g on a procedure for ending th e lease (\"The landlord will provide the tenant 45 days advance written notice prior to the termination date.\") (3) The parties did not agree about wh en or how the lease would end , resulting in termination based on statute: a. lease for 7 days: 2 days notice b. lease for one month: 7 days notice c. lease for one year: 30 days notice d. lease for mobile home space: 60 days notice NOTE: This notice operates to terminate lease as of end of rental period. For example, in a monthtomonth lea se, with rent payable on the fi rst day of the month, the landlord may give notice as early as Sept. 1, or as late as Sept. 23, in order to terminate the lease as of Sept. 30. Landlord/Tenant - Page 5Criminal activity If the lease itself states that criminal activity is a trigger for a forfeiture clause, the ground for summary ejectment is actually \"breach of a lease con dition pp. 182184 for discussion). G.S. 4259 to 73 sets out the statutory procedure for eviction based on criminal activity when the lease does not make that available. The stat ute is long and complex, and a magistrate should not hear a summary ejectment a ction based on the statute before studying pp. 178184 of Small Claims Law. Landlord/Tenant - Page 6Essential Elements and Common Defens es in Summary Ejectment Actions Breach of a lease condition Plaintiff/LL must prove: ___ landlord-tenant relationship ___ lease contains a forfeiture clause ___ T breached lease condition for which forfeiture is specified ___ LL followed procedure set out in lease for decl aring a forfeiture and terminating the lease. Common defenses: ___ failure to follow lease procedure 1 ___ T has not breached (often due to RRAA) ___ waiver2 Failure to pay rent Plaintiff/LL must prove: ___ landlord-tenant relationship; ___ terms of the lease related to obligation to pay rent ___ LL demanded that tenant pay rent on certain date 3 ___ LL waited at least 10 days afte r demand to file this action ___ T has not yet paid the full amount due. Common defenses: ___ T does not owe rent (often due to RRAA) ___ lease contains forfeiture clause 4 ___ failure to make proper demand ___ filing too soon after demand ___ tender 5 Holding over Plaintiff/LL must prove: ___ landlord-tenant relationship ___ terms of lease related to duration and procedure for termination, if any ___ LL has followed lease procedure or, if no ne, given statutory notice, to terminate 6 ___ T has not vacated. Most common defenses: ___ waiver ___ improper notice Landlord/Tenant - Page 7Criminal activity7 Plaintiff/LL must prove one of the following things: ___ Criminal activity occurred within the rental unit ___ The rental unit was used to further criminal activity ___ T, household member, or guest engaged in crim inal activity on premises or in immediate vicinity ___ T gave permission for a barred person to return to property ___ When person barred from unit re-enter ed unit, T failed to notify LL or LEO Most common defenses: ___ T did not know or have reason to kn ow of first three grounds listed above ___ T took all reasonable steps to prevent criminal activity ___ Eviction would create serious injustice 1 Appellate courts have emphasized that LLs must \"strictly comply\" with procedural requirements in lease 2 Unless lease contains provision that LL's acceptance of partial rent does not waive LL's right to SE. 3 This demand for rent must be \"clear and unequivocal.\" Snipes v.

Quite often this deficit is apparent to the magistrate even before a tenant begins introducing evidence - or in some cases in which the tenant is not even present a trial. Sometimes, though, a tenant's own testimony or other evidence will challenge one of the essential ele ments to a degree sufficient to prevent a conclusion that the landlord has proven it by the greater weight of the evidence. One of the most common \"essential elements\" defenses is presented in summary ejectment cases based on default in rent payments - whe ther based on \"breach of a lease condition\" or \"failure to pay rent\" -- when a tenant claims that the condition of the rental premises violated the RRAA, thus reducing the actual amount of rent owed to the LL. See Small Claims Law pp. 197 - 199 for details, including an example of the calculations necessary to assess this defense. Jan. Feb.

Here are some of the most common: Waiver : Waiver is a broad equitable defense that is very fact -specific and potentially applicable in many contract cases. In the LL -T context, the waiver doctrine provides that when a LL learns that T has breached the lease in a manner entitling the LL to terminate the lease, the LL is presented with a choice: either terminate the lease, or \"waive the breach\" and continue on with the agreement. A LL may do either, but may not act incons istently so as to indicate an intention to waive the breach and then seek eviction. Depending on the particular situation, there are many ways to waive the breach, but the most common behavior is to accept money from the T. Nothing else appearing, the assu mption is that a T who gives a LL money does so in the belief that the payment will allow the T to remain in possession of the property. There is an exception to the waiver doctrine when (1) the ground for ejectment is breach of a lease condition, (2) the LL accepts partial payment, and (3) the written lease contains non -waiver provision consistent with these requirements. GS 42 -26(c). Waiver is not an available defense when SE is based on criminal activity pursuant to GS 42, Art. 7, or when plaintiff is a public housing authority, although there are exceptions to this rule. See Small Claims Law, p. 172. Res judicata : A LL who brings a second action for possession after losing a prior action based on the same breach will have the action dismissed based on t his defense, roughly translated as \"it has already been adjudicated.\" Note that failure to pay rent in May is NOT the same breach as failure to pay rent in April. Tender : A tenant who offers to pay the total amount of rent owed plus court costs in cash at any time prior to entry of judgment is entitled to dismissal of the summary ejectment action provided that the ground for eviction is GS 42 -3, the statutory implied forfeiture of failure to pay rent. Tender is not a defense to SE based on any other ground . Because tender is a defense - rather than an offer to settle -- when the ground for eviction is failure to pay rent under GS 42 - 3, a LL cannot defeat the defense merely by refusing to accept payment. Retaliatory eviction: GS Ch. 42, Art. 4A, sets out t he details of this defense. Landlord/Tenant - Page 10Forfeiture Clauses1 Is this a forfeiture clause?

NCREC Standard Form 410-T (2006) Landlord/Tenant - Page 14BE AWARE OF THESE PROCEDURAL RULES FOR SUMMARY EJECTMENT CASES In the absence of a \"simple landlord- tenant relationship,\" both small claims magistrate and district court judge lack subject matter jurisdiction to hear action labeled as \"summary ejectment.\" Agent with personal knowledge may sign complaint and represent LL. GS 7A -223(a). Property owner is rpii and must be listed as plaintiff in complaint. Action must be calendared within 7 business days of complaint being filed. Sheriff must serve summons and complaint within 5 days of complaint being filed. Service of process must occur at least 2 days prior to trial date. Service by first class mail + posting on rental premises is sufficient for award of possession only. Magistrates should leave # 7 related to award of costs on CVM -401 Judgment Form blank. If landlord is seeking both money damages and possession, service is by posting, and defendant is not present, 2017 amendment allows plaintiff to ask that the claims be \"severed,\" with claim for possession heard immediately and money damages claim heard at later time after defendant has been personally served. Service by private process server not allowed even after unsuccessful attempt by sheriff for possession claim, but private process server allowed to serve severed claim for money damages. . Plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the pleadings if: Defendant was served, but has not filed answer nor appeared for trial Complaint lists breach of lease condition for which re- entry is specified as grounds Plaintiff requests JOTP in open court Continuances are available only for good cause and for no more than five days or next session of court, whichever is greater, unless parties consent to longer period Magistrate prohibited from reserving judgment unl ess parties agree or court finds the case is \"more complex.\" In case of complex case, magistrate required to enter judgment within 5 business days. If judgment is for landlord in small claims court and tenant appeals, tenant is subject to being evicted while appeal is pending unless tenant satisfies statutory requirements for obtaining stay. Landlord/Tenant - Page 15C osts of appeal for trial de novo must be paid within 10 (not 20) days of entry of judgment. Appeal subject to dismissal in district court under some conditions, requir ing magistrate to make a finding when tenant presents a defense in small claims court. Sheriff must execute a writ of possession within 5 days of issuance. Landlord/Tenant - Page 16LL-T Notetaking Outline Remember contract analysis applies to these cases, and so do The Ten Mandatory Rules of Procedure. Is there a (rental) contract? May be written or oral (usually), but must be agreement between person entitled to possession of land and Person #2 that Person #2 has right to possess property in exchange for pa ying rent or providing some other service. This is a conditional agreement: \"T has po ssession on condition that T do _____.\" T is purchasing the right to possession of the property for a limited time, while LL retains ownership of property. _____________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This question also goes to MR#1: do you have jurisdiction? In SE action for possession only, amount in controversy N/A, defendant must re side in your county, and there must be LL-T relationship between plaintiff & defendant. _____________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________ If no landlord-tenant relationship exists betw een the parties, the magistrate should dismiss the action and note on the dismissal form that the small claims court is without jurisdiction due to the lack of a landlord-tenant relationship. Who are the parties? As to the named plaintiff, remember MR#6: the real party in interest is the owner of the property, and the lawsuit must be brought in that person's name. An exception to the general rule applies in SE actions, however, allowing an agent of the owner with personal knowledge to sign the complaint and present the case . (MR #3). The defendant in a SE action is the person(s) who contracted with the LL to rent the property. Other occupants have no contractual relationship with the owner; they are there with the tenant's agreement and lose their right to occupancy automatically when the tenant is ejected. _____________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________ Landlord/Tenant - Page 17Preliminary procedural considerations MR#2: Service of process or appearance is required. In SE cases only, sheriff may serve process by mailing to defendant's last known address and posting on door of premises. See Return of Service re posting on back of summons. When service is accomplished by mail/posting and defendant does not appear in court, no money judgment is permissible. _____________________________________________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________ MR#4: If defendant is not pres ent, SCRA affidavit required. MR #5: Defendant must have been served at least 2 days prior to trial. Statute excludes legal holidays, suggesting that requirement is 2 calend ar days: service on Friday PM sufficient for case to be heard Monday AM. Special Rule for Continuances: In 2013 GS 7A-223(b) was amended to provide that (1) an action for SE should be continued only for good cause shown, and (2) a continuance in SE cases only should not exceed 5 days or until the next session of small claims court unless the parties agree to a longer delay. Disputed title to real property will not be resolved in small claims court. If a defendant files an answer raising this issue, assignment to small claims court is withdrawn and the case is put on the district court docket. _____________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ MR #8: Plaintiff must produce evidence in support of claim even if defendant is not present. Subject to one exception, discussed below, a LL must introduce evidence of each essential element of the claim even if defendant is not present. Just as in other civil cases, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing a prima facie right to relief before the defendant is required to produce any evidence in defense. Exception: Judgment on the Pleadings. (see requirements on p. 30, Small Claims Law) What Are the terms of the contract? Did Defendant Breach? What Are the Damages? ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Landlord/Tenant - Page 18Magistrate must either render judgment in open court or reserve judgment.* In 2013 GS 7A-22 was amended to restrict reservation of judgment in SE actions unless (1) the parties agree, or (2) the case is \"more complex,\" in which case judgment must be entered within 5 business days. The statute provides examples of issues that might render an action more complex (e.g., subsidized housin g cases, counterclaims, criminal activity), but circumstances are not limited to the examples listed. Two other recent legislative amendments relate to appeals from SE cases, but both require modification of usual procedure by the magistrate at the small claims level. First, a litigant who wishes to appeal from a small claims ju dgment is required to pay costs of appeal within a certain period. Failure to make timely payment results in automatic dismissal of the appeal. In SE actions only, costs must be pa id within 10 days of entry of judgment. In all other small claims cases, the appellant has 20 days to pay costs. (Note that parties who qualify as indigent make be excused from this requirement.) GS 7A-228. The second legislative change to GS 7A-228 establishes a procedure for dismissal of a tenant's appeal under certain circumstan ces related to the degree of a tenant's participation in the action. The sole involvement of the magistrate in this procedure is to make a notation on the judgment if the defendant raised a defense in the small claims action. If a tenant raised a defense in writing, that will be part of the record, but an oral defense will not\u2014thus the importance of the magistrate's notation. It is important to note that the magistrate need not have found the defense persuasive\u2014indeed, there would be no appeal by the tenant if that were the case. An unpersuasive defense has legal significance in this context, and must be noted. Landlord/Tenant - Page 19 Landlord/Tenant - Page 20DGL/SOG Introduction to Small Claims 2017 What Magistrates Need to Know About the RRAA The Residential Rental Agreements Act (and Other Tenants' Rights Statutes) The Residential Rental Agreements Act is set out in G.S. Chapter 42, Sections 38 to 44. This law, which was passed in 1977, changed NC law to require landlords to maintain residential rental premises at a certain minimal level of habitability. This obligation is imposed as a matter of social policy by the State of North Carolina. For that reason, a tenant has no authority to give a landlord permission to violate the law. In exchange for providing greater protections to tenants, including prohibiting selfhelp eviction and requiring landlords to provide fit and habitable housing, a number of preferential procedures are provided to landlords allowing fast and inexpensive evictions when tenants breach a lease . Who and What is Covered by the Law? The RRAA applies only to residential rental agreements. The law applies to any dwelling unit, including mobile homes and mobile home spaces, as well as surrounding grounds and facilities provided for use by residential tenants. The statute defines \"landlord\" to include not only property owners, but also rental agencies or other persons who have or appear to have authority to comply with the legal requirements imposed by the RRAA . The RRA A does not apply to vacation rentals covered by GS Ch. 42A, temporary lodging in hotels or motels, and to permissive occupancy of premises furnished without charge. What Does the Law Provide? The law imposes 8 distinct obligations on a landlord: 1. It must comply with building and housing codes. 2. It must keep premises in a fit and habitable condition. 3. It must keep common areas in safe condition 4. It must maintain and promptly repair electrical, plumbing, heating, and other supplied facilities and appliances. 5. It must install a smoke detector and keep it in good repair. 6. It mu st install a carbon monoxide detector and keep it in good repair. Landlord/Tenant - Page 21DGL/SOG Introduction to Small Claims 2017 7. It must notify the tenant if water the landlord charges to provide exceeds a certain contaminant level. 8. It must repair within a reasonable time any \"imminently dangerous condition\" listed in the statute: a. Unsafe wiring. b. Unsafe flooring or steps. c. Unsafe ceilings or roofs. d. Unsafe ch imneys or flues. e. Lack of potable water. f. Lack of operable locks on all doors leading to the outside. g. Broken windows or lack of operable locks on all windows on the ground level. h. Lack of operable heating facilities capable of heating living areas to 65 degrees Fahrenheit when it is 20 degrees Fahrenheit outside from Novem b er 1 through March 31. i. Lack of an operable toilet. j. Lack of an operable bathtub or shower. k. Rat infestation as a result of defects in the structure that make the premises not impervious to rodents. l. Excessive standing water, sewage, or flooding problems caused by plumbing leaks or inadequate drainage that contribute to mosquito infestation or mold. Notice Requirements General rule: The tenant must give whatever notice is necessary to reasonably permit the landlord to fulfill his obligations. With regard to #4, the rule related to electrical, plumbing, and other \"facilities and appliances,\" the tenant is required to give written notice that repair or maintenance is necessary (except in case of emergency). A property owner is presumed to have knowledge of conditions in existe nce at the begi nning of the rental, and no further notice by the tenant is required. A Tenant Can't Excuse a Landlord from the Law's Requirements The obligations imposed on landlords by the RRAA are not based on the rental agreement between the parties, but are imposed by law. Consequently, the rules apply even if the contract says nothing about them even if the lease specifically states that the tenant waives those rights even if the housing had obvious violations which the tenant was aware of when the tenant entered into the lease even if the rent is substantially lowered to reflect the FRV of the defective proper ty Landlord/Tenant - Page 22DGL/SOG Introduction to Small Claims 2017 Q: What is the effect of a lease provision that specifies that an appliance (e.g., dishwasher) is being provided as an accommodation to the tenant, but only if the tenant agrees to pay any cost of repair if the appliance breaks? A: The provision is not enforceable; the landlord is required to repair the dishwasher. Note that the landlord is not required to provide a dishwasher, bu t is required to maintain and repair those appliances it provides. Q: What are the landlord's rights and obligations if the tenant's own behaviors cause an imminently dangerous condition (#8) on the property? A: The landlord is required to repair or remedy any imminently dangerous condition, even one that results from the tenant's fault, but the tenant is responsible for paying the actual and reasonable costs of repairs. A Tenant Has Obligations Too GS 4243 lists the requirements applicable to tenants related to keeping property clean and undamaged and to cooperating with the landlord to ensure that the rental unit has at all times an operable smoke and/or carbon monoxide alarm. A landlord who becomes aware of a tenant's violations of these requirements is required to give written notice to the tenant except in case of emergency. Remedies: What Happens When a Landlord Fails to Meet His Responsibilities Under the Act? At the outset, you are confronted with two apparently contradictory provisions of the Act that have worried commentators. On the one hand, the obligations of the landlord and the tenant under the Act are \"mutually dependent\"\u2014that is, each of them is obligated only if the other keeps his part of the bargain. Based just on this provision, one might reasonably conc l ude that a tenant's obligation to pay rent \"depends\" on the landlord's provision of fit and habitable premises. But another section of the Act specifically says that a tenant may not \"unilaterally withhold rent prior to a judicial determination of the tenant's right to do so.\" What does this mean? No one is absolutely certain, because there have a ctually been only a few appellate cases interpreting the RRAA. It seems clear, though, that a tenant who withholds rent because the landlord violates the RRAA risks being evicted for failure to pay rent. A much safer course would be to pay rent and then bring an action in rent abatement; a ten ant who prevails in this action will recover damages for the landlord's past violation of the Act and may well also secure a \"judicial determination of [his] right\" to withhold future rent until the landlord complies with the law. If a tenant does not adopt this safer course, but inste a d withholds rent, one leading commentator suggests the following approach: Landlord/Tenant - Page 23DGL/SOG Introduction to Small Claims 2017 First, determine the actual amount of rent owed, after factoring in the amount of offset to which the tenant is entitled due to the landlord's breach of the RRAA. If that amount is zero, dismiss the action. If the amount is greater than zero, the next step depends on the specific basis for the action: If the action is based on breach of a lease condition for which forfeiture is specified, the landlord is entitl ed to possession upon making the usual showing. If the action is based on failure to pay rent, however, the tenant may successfully defend by tendering the amount which the magistrate has dete rmined is actually owed. Repair & Deduct? Can a tenant hire someone to fix the roof, pay for it out of his own pocket, and then take that amount out of the rent? We don't know, and the commentators are divided in their predictions. Until North Carolina courts clarify the law, it seems likely that many courts will cautiously allow tenants to do this, with the facts of the individual case being import ant (a tenant who gives notice, waits a long time, and then spends a small amount of money being much more likely to prevail than a tenant who fails to give notice and makes major repairs, such as replacing a roof). Procedure The Act states that a tenant may enforce his rights under the RRAA by civil action, including \"recoupment, counterclaim, defense, setoff, and any other proceeding, including an action for possession.\" Thus, a magistrate may be confronted with applying the Act in any of the following circumstances: 1. The landlord brings an action for posses sion and/or money damages, and the tenant d efends by contending that the landlord violated the Act. 2. The landlord brings an action for possession and/or money damages, and the tenant brings a counterclaim for rent abatement based on the landlord's violation of the Act. 3. The landlord brings an action for money damages, and the tenant responds by arguing that the landlord's damages should be reduced (\"set off\") because of his violation of the Act. 4. The tenant files an action for rent abatement. Damages The tenant is entitled to the difference between the FRV (fair rental value) of the property as warranted and the FRV of the property as it actually is, plus any incidental damages (for example, the tenant had to Landlord/Tenant - Page 24DGL/SOG Introduction to Small Claims 2017 buy a space heater when the furnace stopped working). NOTE: A tenant may only recover up to the amount of rent he actually paid. How are damages proven? No expert testimony is required. Witnesses may offer their opinion about the FRV of property, and the magistrate may also rely on the magistrate's own experience in determining reasonable dama g es. Exercise: Let's Look at Some Lease Provisions Lease #1: Resident accepts Property in its present \"ASIS\" condition . . . _____________________________________________________________________________________ All appliances of any kind including window air conditioners are specifically excluded from this Agreement. Such appliances remain as a convenience to Resident and Management assumes no responsibility for their operation. No part of the monthly rent is attributable to them. ______________________ ____ ___________________________________________________________ Discount for prompt payment and maintenance: Time is of the essence of this Agreement. If the rent, and any previous balance due, is received and accepted on or before (the due date described above) and Resident complies with the maintenance requirements contained herein, a _______ Dollar discoun t will be credited to the rental payment. Resident shall at his own ex pense and at all times maintain the premises in a clean and sanitary manner, including all equipment and appliances therein. . . Resident expressly stipulates and agrees that Management is granting a rental discount in exchange for Resident's agreeing to perform and bear the expense of, or have performed, minor maintenance and repairs on the dwelling, therefore Manage men t shall NOT be responsible for maintenance and repairs of the premises during the term of this Agreement. If Resident repair responsibilities conflict with any state laws to the contrary, Resident expressly agrees to fully waive and relin quish any protections so provided. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Lease #2 In the event repairs are needed beyond the competence of the Tenant, Tenant is urged to contact the Landlord. Tenant is offered the loan of the shed as an incentive to make his own decisions on repairs to the property and to allow Landlord to rent the property without the need to employ professional management. Therefore, as much as possible, Tenant should refr ain from contacting the landlord or his agent except for emergencies, or for expensive repairs. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Landlord/Tenant - Page 25DGL/SOG Introduction to Small Claims 2017 Tenant warrants that any work or repairs performed by him will be undertaken only if he is competent and qualified to perform it. Tenant will be totally responsible for all activities to assure that work is done in a safe manner which will meet all the applicable codes and statutes. Tenant furth er warrants that he will be accountable for any mishaps or accidents resulting from such work, and will hold the Landlord free from harm, litigation, or claims of any other person. Tenant is responsible for all plumbing repairs including faucets, leaks, stopped up pipes, frozen pipes, water damage, and bathroom caulkin g. ____ ________________________________________________________________________________ Appliances or furniture in the unit at date of lease are loaned not leased to Tenant. Maintenance of appliances or furniture is the responsibility of Tenant who will keep them in good repair. ____________________________________________________________________________________ Rent Abatement Problem Larry Landlord rents an apartment to Tommy Tenant. There is no written lease. Tommy pays $600 rent on the first of each month. Larry files for summary ejectment based on failure to pay rent on March 15, based on Tommy's failure to pay rent for February and for March. You hear the case on March 25. Imagine that Larry establishes a prima facie case, but Tommy's testimony is that the apartment has had no heat since he moved in, on Jan. 1st. He testifies that he notified Larry immediately of the problem, and Larry promised to fix it, but beyond providing a space heater, has taken no other steps to repair the heating system. Tommy tells you that he believes the apartment with a single space heater, rather than a central heating system, is worth only $300 a month. He is prepared to tender the full amount due in order to maintain possession of the property. Assuming you find Tommy's estimate credible, what amount must he tender? ______________ January February March FRV $300 $300 $300 Amt by T $600 0 0 Balance +$300 0 ($300) Assume that Tommy is not asking to remain in possession of the property, but that he is instead merely disputing the amount owed. What is your money judgment? ___________ ___________ Landlord/Tenant - Page 26DGL/SOG/April 2017 Fees in Summary Ejectment Actions For Leases Entered Into On or After Oct. 1, 2009 Late Fees In residential leases, parties may agree to late fee for payments five or more days late. When rent is paid monthly, the maximum fee is $15 or 5%, whichever is greater. In case of weekly rent, maximum is $4 or 5%, whichever is greater. Complaint Filing Fee In residential leases, parties may agree to this fee, not to exceed $15 or 5%, whichever is greater, only if: tenant was in default LL filed complaint for SE tenant cured the default LL dismissed the claim. Fee may be charged as part of amount required to cure default. Court Appearance Fee In residential leases, parties may agree to this fee, not to exceed 10% of monthly rent if tenant was in default LL won a SE action neither party appealed.1 Second Trial Fee In residential leases, parties may agree to this fee, not to exceed 12% of monthly rent, in event of new trial following appeal from small claims judgment. If CourtAppearance Fee was awarded as part of small claims judgment, that award is vacated. Available if tenant was in default LL prevailed. Additional Rules LL can charge only one of the last three fees, and that fee may not be deducted from subsequent rent payment or asserted as ground for default in subsequent SE action. Prohibits LL from attempting to charge a larger fee and provides lease provision in violation of law is void. 1 In 2016 GS 4246(f) was amended to allow magistrates to award a court appearance fee upon entry of judgment in favor of the landlord, with the provision that this award is to be vacated if the tenant successfully appeals the judgment. Landlord/Tenant - Page 27DGL/SOG/April 2017 Landlord/Tenant - Page 28 DAMAGES THAT MIGHT BE AWARDED TO LL IN SUMMARY EJECTMENT AC TION FOUR TYPES 1. Unpaid rent up to date of judgment 2. Breach of contract damages a. Occupancy damages for continued possession after end of lease b. When lease is for a fixed period, damages for remainder of term NOTE d uty to mitigate c. Check lease for liquidated damages clauses 3. Fees pursuant to GS 42 -46 (residential only) a. Late fees b. Administrative fees c. Attorney fees 4. Damage to property (exceeding normal wear and tear) Measure is difference between FMV of property before and after damage. Cost of repair may be relevant to determination, but is not itself proper measure of damages. PROBLEM 1 On Jan. 1st, LL and T entered into a six -month lease, and T almost immediately began having problems paying the $600/month rent. After 3 months of T paying late and/or making partial payments, LL informed T of her intent to file for summary ejectment. T stated that s he would just move out, because she had lost her job and did not anticipate being able to pay the rent. LL agreed that would be best, and T moved out on March 31. On July 1, LL filed an action for money owed with damages as follows: $350 in unpaid rent as of the time T moved out $1800 for the three months remaining on the lease period $90 for six months of late fees, $50 administrative fee $75 attorney fees (LL is unrepresented, but he testifies that he paid $75 to an attorney for consultation about rep resenting himself in this action, and has a receipt) $1200 property damage. LL's testimony about the property damage was that the entire rental premises were so dirty and in such Landlord/Tenant - Page 29disrepair that he was forced to hire a professional cleaning crew ($250), t o repaint the entire premises ($400), replace the 8 -year -old carpet ($800), pay a landscaping company to weed and prune in the grown -up yard ($275), and replace the refrigerator ($500). PROBLEM 2 PROCEDURAL ISSUES RELATED TO DAMAGES RELATED TO COMPLAIN T In all cases in which a plaintiff seeks money damages, the magistrate should award damages - if at all - based on the evidence presented at trial. Remember that the complaint serves a notice function, and that the plaintiff is not limited to the amount s tated in the complaint. In summary ejectment actions, the amount of rent due as of the date of trial will almost always differ from the amount requested in the complaint. It is not necessary to amend the complaint, unless the amount requested at trial is s ignificantly greater or due to newly asserted claims. WHEN SERVICE IS BY POSTING AND THE DEFENDANT DOES NOT APPEAR The wording of the summary ejectment complaint form requests money damages in addition to possession unless the plaintiff affirmatively modif ies the form. The result is that many times plaintiffs may be largely unaware that they have asserted two separate claims for relief, each of which must be disposed of in a final judgment. When service is by posting and the defendant does not appear, the m agistrate does not have jurisdiction to award money damages, including costs. If the plaintiff does not request that the claim be severed pursuant to GS 7A-223(b1), the magistrate should note on the judgment form that the claim for damages was not consider ed because service was by posting. If the plaintiff does request that the claim be severed, note that the issue about costs is resolved: no determination as to costs is made at Part 1 of the trial, regarding possession, and the tenant will have been perso nally served when Part 2 of the case is decided and a final judgment entered. RELATED TO STAY OF ENFORCEMENT A judgment awarding possession of rental premises is enforceable after ten days even if the tenant appeals, unless the tenant obtains the (entirely separate) stay of enforcement pending appeal. Because the stay procedure involves calculating amounts of money to be deposited in the clerk's office, litigants and magistrates Landlord/Tenant - Page 30alike sometimes confuse the details of this procedure with calculation of damag es. This is particularly true because the magistrate must enter information related to both aspects of the case on the judgment form. On the judgment form, under Findings, the magistrate should complete #3 by recording the smallest amount of rent both pa rties agree is owed. (If the defendant does not appear for trial or file an answer, this amount will be based on the LL's testimony and/or the amount requested in the complaint.) Note that this record of the parties' contentions is entirely unrelated to th e amount of rent, if any, actually determined by the magistrate to be owed. On the portion of the judgment form reproduced below, the block labeled Rate of Rent should be completed for use by the clerk if necessary in case of appeal. On the other hand, the block labeled Amt. of Rent in Arrears should be completed by the magistrate only if the intent is to enter a money judgment. Potential res judicata issues : The legal doctrine of res judicata provides that a final judgment on the merits bars subsequent actions between the same parties on the same issues \u2014not only those issues which actually were litigated, but also those that might have been. GS 42 -28 provide s that a landlord in a summary ejectment action may seek, in addition to possession, \"rent in arrears, and damages for the occupation of the premises since the cessation of the estate of the lessee . . . but if he omits to make such claim, he shall not be prejudiced thereby in any other action for their recovery.\" In a significant case, the Court of Appeals reminded us that the statutory right to seek monetary damages in a separate action from a summary ejectment claim \"does not create an exception to the g eneral rule that all damages must be recovered in one action.\" Chrisalis Properties, Inc. v. Separate Quarters , Inc., 101 NC App 81 (1990), rev. denied 328 NC 570 (1991). The rule applie s to all damages arising out of tenant's breach of lease and its subse quent termination. Arguably, damage to property would not fall under this rule, because it is a tort, rather than breach of contract. Landlord/Tenant - Page 31 Impact of security deposit: Unless the security deposit is part of the case - typically because tenant has filed a count erclaim - the magistrate should determine damages and enter judgment without regard to any security deposit that might be available as another source of compensation for damages. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISIONS Liquidated damages: \"a sum which a party to a contract agrees to pay or deposit which he agrees to forfeit if he breaks some promise . . . arrived at by a good -faith effort to estimate in advance the actual damage which would probably ensue from the breach.\" Penalty: \"a sum which a party similarly agr ees to pay or forfeit, . . . but which is fixed, not as a pre -estimate or probable actual damages, but as a punishment, the threat of which is designed to prevent the breach.\" McCormick, Damages \u00a7146 (1935) A liquidated damages provision is enforceable und er North Carolina law when: 1. damages are speculative or difficult to ascertain, and 2. the amount stipulated is a reasonable estimate of probable damages, OR the amount stipulated is reasonably proportionate to the damages actually caused by the breach. Knutto n v. Cofield , 273 NC 355 (1968). The party challenging the validity of the provision has the burden of demonstrating that it does not satisfy the requirements for enforceability. Consider the following provisions taken from a NC residential lease: Occupancy by guests staying over 14 days will be considered in violation of this agreement and additional monthly rent of $100 per person shall be due chargeable from the beginning date of this Agreement. (emphasis original) Please be aware that a minimum $250 will be charged if the apartment is not clean (normal wear and tear excepted) upon move out, including steam cleaning carpets. If Management elects to accept rent after the due date, resident agrees to pay $5 for each day after the Due Date as additio nal rent. In the event collection of past due rent must be made by Management at the Property location, the Resident agrees to pay a $30 collection fee as liquidated damages for each such attempted collection. . . . In the event any check given by Residen t to Management is returned by the bank unpaid, Resident agrees to pay to Manageme nt $50.00 as liquidated damages. Landlord/Tenant - Page 32LandlordTenant Law: NC Small Claims Law by Brannon (2009) The chapter on LandlordTenant Law in Joan Brannon's book on small claims law continues to be an outstanding reference. While a few portions of the text have been rendered inaccurate by subsequent legislation or case law, the majority of these relate to procedural modifications applicable to small claims court. Readers should be aware of the following changes: The unconscionability issue discussed on p. 160 was directly addressed by the NC Supr eme Court in Eastern Carolina Regional Housing Authority v. Lofton, 789 SE2d 449 (2016), in an opinion holding that a landlord is not required to produce evidence negating the possibility that eviction in the particular circumstances would be unconscionable. Referen ces throughout the text to damages not exceeding $5000 should read \"10,000\" due to legislation in 2013 increasing the jurisdictional amount for small claims cases. The section on page 170 referring to \"Other Contractual Fees\" has been substantially ame nded by legislation enacted in 2009 amending GS 42 46 establishing a hierarchy of permissible administrative fees. In 2012 the General Assembly added GS 4226(c) permitting a landlord to accept partial payment of rent in certain circumstances without waiving the right to pursue eviction. This legislation is an important addition to the discussion of waiver beginning on p. 171 of the book. The section labeled Secu rity Deposits on p. 189 of the book should be supplemented with legislation making minor amendments to GS 4251. In addition, Neil v. Kuester Real Estate Services, Inc., 237 NC App 132 (2014) is an important case limiting the \"full refund\" remedy for violation of the Act to willful violations of GS 4250, the provision related to the deposit of funds to a trust account. The section on pp. 190192 governing a landlord's right to dispose of tenant's property should be revised to correct references to dollar amounts and time periods in accordance with statutory amendments set out in GS 42 25.9 and 4236.2. Landlord/Tenant - Page 33 Landlord/Tenant - Page 34 On the Civil Side A UNC School of Government Blog Categories A lease is a contract, but......... This entry was contributed by Dona Lewandowski on October 11, 2017 at 8:00 am and is filed under Small Claims Law. In my last post, I emphasized the contractual nature of a rental agreement. My main point was that the agreement between the landlord and tenant, whether oral or written, is where a small claims magistrate begins in a summary ejectment lawsuit. Often parties wrongly assume that some aspect of their mutual commitments \"goes without saying.\" In fact, a summary ejectment action is at its heart a breach of contract lawsuit, and the specific terms of the contract are the starting point in determining any dispute. While the lease is always the beginning point, the magistrate's analysis must often go further than just the parties' agreement. As I've previously discussed, landlord -tenant law is replete with special rules, some (mostly procedural) tending to favor the landlord and some (mostly substantive) tending to favor the tenant. The US Supreme Cour t has pointed out that these procedural advantages and consumer protections, viewed together, work to balance the legal scales related to this unique legal relationship. Lindsey v . Normet , 405 U.S. 56, 72, 92 S. Ct. 862, 873, 31 L. Ed. 2d 36 (1972). This post highlights some of the many ways consumer protection legislation affects the residential contractual agreements between landlords and tenants. The discussion that follows is l imited to that sort of agreement. Consumer legislation in landlord -tenant law is scattered across a number of statutes, and some additional protective principles - usually equitable in nature - have been recognized at common law. These rules vary in their impact on a lease agreement: they may delete a lease provision by deeming it void and unenforceable, insert a provision as \"implied by law,\" or authorize certain provisions only if they comply with statutory restrictions. Sometimes the statutes establish t he consumer's right to sue the landlord for violations, while others authorize tenants to raise violations in defense of a summary ejectment action by the landlord. Violations of some of these rules have been held to constitute an unfair or deceptive pract ice under GS 75 -1.1, resulting in awards of triple damages and attorney fees. A comprehensive list of these provisions is beyond the scope of this post, but a loosely -organized summary appears below: Specialized Protections for Certain Kinds of Tenants: Victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking GS 42 -42.2 Prohibits discrimination in rental practices GS 42 -45.1 Allows early termination of rental agreement GS 42-42.3 Allows change of locks on rental premises Landlord/Tenant - Page 35Persons serving in the military GS 42 -45 Allows early termination of rental agreement 50 USC 3955 (Federal) Allows early termination of rental agreement 50 USC 3951 (Federal) Restricts evictions/seizure of personal property Tenants of foreclosed property GS 45 -21.17 Requires certain tenants to receive advance notice of foreclosure sale GS 45 -21.16A Allows early termination of lease by tenants in anticipation of foreclosure GS 42-45.2 & GS 45 -21.33A Allows lease to survive foreclosure Recent renewal of federal Protecting Tenants at Foreclosure Act, allowing lease to survive foreclosure Tenants in subsidized housing Numerous federal statutes & regulations as well as NC case law (see citations & discussion in Brannon, NC Small Claims Law , pp. 184 -186, 211) require strict compliance with procedural requirements and showing of good cause for termination of tenancy.

GS 42 -36.1A Landlord/Tenant - Page 37 Landlord/Tenant - Page 38Failure to Pay Rent 1. LL has a forfeiture clause in the lease providing that being more than 3 days late with the rent on more than 2 occasions in a 6 -month period is a breach of the lease authorizing the LL to terminate the lease. T recently lost his job and \u2014for the first time -- missed a rent payment. The following day, on March 2, LL demanded that the tenant make immediate arrangements to catch up the rent or else be evicted. On March 15, having received no payment, the LL filed this action for SE. Who wins? 2. LL's lease cont ains a provision stating that, in the event the T is late with rent, the T is aware and agrees that, pursuant to the lease, the LL is considered to have made a demand effective the moment the payment is late. T misses a payment on March 1, and LL files for SE on March 11 without having communicated with T. Who wins? 3. T knows that he's likely to have trouble paying the rent this month and discusses it with the LL, who says, \"Just do the best you can \u2014pay as much as you can as soon as you can, because I don't want to have to evict you.\" That conversation happened on February 27, and on March 1, the T missed the rent payment. On March 11, LL files for SE. Who wins? 4. Imagine the above conversation happened on March 1. Different result? 5. T failed to pay rent on M arch 1, and LL promptly demanded the rent. On March 9, LL files for SE. Who wins? 6. T failed to pay rent on March 1, and LL promptly demanded the rent. On March 9, LL accepted half the rent. On March 11, LL files for SE. Who wins? 7. T failed to pay rent on March 1, and LL promptly demanded the rent. On March 11, LL filed for SE. When the case comes to court, the T offers to pay total rent plus reimbursement for court costs, in cash right then. LL refuses to accept the sum offered, saying she's willing to fo rget about the money, but still wants possession, saying she doesn't want to have to come back to court every time the tenant is late. Who wins? 8. Is the result different if T is prepared to pay all past due rent but doesn't have enough cash for court cost s? Landlord/Tenant - Page 39 Landlord/Tenant - Page 40Holding Over 1. Lease runs from Jan. 1 - Dec. 31, 2018. On Jan. 2, 2019, LL files SE action. Testimony is that T has always paid rent on time.

Lease says nothing about notice required to terminate. When the year ended, T continued to occupy the property. LL files for summary ejectment. T defends on ground that LL failed to give notice of termination. Who wins? What legal principle explains your answer? 2. T had a lease for one year, with rent payable at the first of each month. At the end of the year he remained on the property and continued to pay rent. Six months later, LL filed a summary ejectment action on the ground that T held over after the one-year lease. (He's decided he could get more money if he rented to a newT.) Who wins? What legal principle explains your answer? 3. LL and T have an oral lease agreement to rent an apartment on a month -to-month basis for $250/month. T agreed to pay $250 and move in on July 1. He paid for July and August, but on Sept. 1he failed to pay. On Sept. 2 LL demanded the rent. On Sept. 5 LL filed a summary ejectment lawsuit. Trial was held on Sept 30. LL proved that the Sept rent was due Sept. 1, that he demanded it on Sept. 2, and that it remained unpaid at the time of trial. T offers a check for $250 in court, but LL insists on a judgment. Who wins? What legal principle explains your answer? 4. LL and T have an oral lease providing for month -to-month tenancy, with rent due the first day of the month. T failed to pay rent on Jan. 1. On Jan. 10, LL gives T notice that he wants to end the lease at the end of the month, telling T she'll have to be out of the rental property by that day. When T remained on the property on Feb. 1LL filed this action. At trial, T offers a cash payment for the Jan. and Feb. rent and court costs. LL insists on a judgment. Who wins? What legal principle explains your answer? 5. LL and T have a written one-year lease requiring payment of $400/month due on the first. The lease contains a forfeiture clause for failure to pay rent. T failed to pay rent on May 1, and LL filed an action seeking possession on May 3, seeking possession and back rent. At trial on May 25 Tasks you to dismiss the case because LL did not offer any evidence that he demanded the rent and waited ten days before filing the action. Who wins? What legal principle explains your answer? 6. Same facts, except that T is not present at trial and LL asks for judgment on the pleadings. Do you grant his request? What legal principle explains your answer? Landlord/Tenant - Page 437. LL has filed a summary ejectment action based on holding over at the end of a lease for six months. The lease ended on May 31, and you hear the case on June 15.The monthly rent was $250. At trial LL offers evidence that she has entered into a lease with a new tenant, who was to move in on June 1, at an increased rental rate of $300/month. LL also seeks damages for injury to property: she found nicks in the living room wall and the clothesline in the backyard on the ground. She says it will cost $75 to paint the living room and $25 to put up a new clothesline. LL is seeking $300 (rent for June) plus $100 damage to property. T says he moved out on the 10th, and so should have to pay only $83.33 (10 days, based on his rent of $250). He also says the clothesline was at least 10 years old and fell down because the metal rusted through. What damages do you award? State your reasons. 8. LL filed a summary ejectment action on May 31 after T failed to pay rent for May. Trial is held on June 15. LL proves that rent was $350 a month, T failed to pay, and that LL demanded the rent on May 10. Assuming you rule in LL's favor, what is the amount of your judgment? If T came to court and offered tender as a defense, what amount would be required for an effective tender? 9.T rents a mobile home space from LL. She failed to pay rent on May 1. On May 2 LL demanded the rent, and filed this action on May 15. At trial on June 10, LL proves the terms of the lease, that rent has not been paid, and that he made demand on the 2nd. T defends based on the special law requiring 60 days notice in cases involving rental of mobile home spaces. Who wins? Why? 10. LL brings an action for summary ejectment based on failure to pay rent. At trial LL proves that the lease provided for a monthly rental of $550, that she made demand, and waited 10 days before filing this action. She seeks possession, $825 for 1 \u00bd months rent, a late fee of $60 (for 2 months at $30/month), and an administrative fee of $150 for her inconvenience in having to come to court. Assume that the written lease has a late fee and administrative fee provision consistent with the amounts she seeks. What damages do you award? 11. LL has filed a SE action against T based on breach of a lease condition (specifically, a clause stating that having a pet on the premises results in an automatic forfeiture of the lease). The one-year lease provides for monthly rent of $450. LL testifies that he has seen a cat in T's apartment. He also states that T did not pay rent for this month (having been served with the complaint and summons on the first of the month), and so asks for two weeks back rent. T defends, saying (1) he has no proof she had a cat, (2) she certainly doesn't have a cat now, and (3) she's prepared to tender rent for the entire month in addition to court costs. How do you rule?

I have been married to my husband for ten years. I became pregnant with my first child shortly after we were married. We now have three children, ages ni ne, seven and six. Even from the beginning, my husband has made all of the decisions for our family. He told me that my job was to be a good wife\u2014 to take care of the children and to cook and clean for him. The first time he hit me was when I was pregnant wi th my first child. We had come home from my mother's house and he was angry about something. I think I had forgotten to buy a kind of food item that he wanted, and then he slapped me. I thought it was just an isolated event. I never thought he would do it again. Since then, he has hit, kicked, choked, slapped and bu rned me. He does not hurt me physically that often, though, maybe only once a month. Mainly, when I do something he doesn't like, such as visiting my mother or talking on the phone to a friend, he calls me a prostitute and other bad names, and tells me that he will take the children and go to his mother 's home if I am not a good wife. He refuses to let me take a job, even though all of our children are in school, and I would be qualified for many different kinds of jobs. He does not let me have any money, except for a little for grocery shopping. He is very jealous and possessive. A few months ago, he became very angry because I was late getting home from the store. He accused me of seeing another man and punched a hole in the door between the kitchen and the living room. My sons were there and saw this, and he yelled at them to go to their rooms. I recently overheard him talking to my seven-ye ar-old son. He was asking if my son ever saw me talking to \"other men.\" He told my son that I was crazy and that my son should watch me and tell him if I did anything strange. Another time, we went to a party given by a friend of his from work. I met the wife of one of the people my husband works with. We spent a long time talkin g. After some time, my husband came up to me, grabbed my arm so tightly it hurt and left bruises, an d whispered in my ear, \"We' re leaving.\" Just by the look he gave me, I knew he was angry that I spent so much time talking with the woman, and that he would likely beat me when we got home. When we got home, he smashed a framed picture I have of myself with a group of my friends at the university, before I was married, by throwing it at the wall near where I was standing. He told me that I \"knew\" what would happen if I continued to disobey him. A few months ago, my husband came home late with friends and made me get up to cook them food. He started joking with his friends about how much I weighed, and that I was like all other women who let themselves go once they got married. He called me many bad names. After his friends left, he woke me up again and forced me to have sex with him, even though I didn't want to and was feeling sick. Recently, I tried to talk to my husband about the abuse. He got very angry. He said he doesn't hurt me any more than is to be expected of a husband and that in fact he thin ks that he is too nice to me. He said that if he did happen to be a bit harsh with me sometimes, it was my fault anyway for not being a good wife and letting myself become so unattractive. I love my husband, but I do not think I can continue to live with him. He has threatened to kill me, the children, and himself if I leave him, and I don't have anywhere to go. I don't have a job or any money, and would not be able to find another place to s tay even if I did leave. Understanding Domestic Violence - Page 9 Understanding Domestic Violence - Page 10 Do's and Don'ts of Handling Domestic Violence Victims DO DON'T Explain the services available in a simple and direct manner. Assume that battered women know about their options and the services available. Prioritize the victim's needs. Overload the victim with services and decisions. Express concern for their safety and that of their children. Empower the victim with information that increases their choices. Ever ask the victim why they stay. This is a shaming remark, which insinuates the victim is at fault. Leaving does not always solve the problem. Be aware of your own attitude, experiences and reactions to abuse. It is appropriate to disagree with the victim's behavior and/or attitude while remaining objective, empathetic and understanding. Impose your own values and make quick judgments. Your reaction to the victim's responses will be communicated strongly. Help the victim understand the danger and repetitiveness of the violence. Expect the victim to exaggerate or invent the violence. Encourage the victim to take small steps, which will promote independence and build self-confidence. Try to rescue the victim. Take into consideration cultural values and beliefs. Lump all victims into one category. Challenge any efforts on the victim's part to justify the abuse through religion. Reject the woman's religion or ignore references to religious beliefs. Convey fears for the victim's safety and respect their reasons for staying. Separation from the abuser can be the most dangerous time for the victim. Convey disappointment if the victim chooses to stay. This can elicit feelings of failure and worthlessness. Define your role as a court official; be realistic about what you can and cannot do with regards to the relationship. Get caught up in the role of marriage counselor, mediator and/or referee. Recognize that the victim's reactions and responses may change frequently and be unpredictable. Reactions will range from resistance to cooperation. Become cynical with the victim's failure to take the action or respond the way you believe they should. Your frustration can result in victim blaming and impact your ability to intervene effectively. Express your concerns if the situation is lethal and take appropriate action. Ignore or minimize the potential dangerousness of the situation. Be patient and honest with the victim. Expect instant decision-m aking by the victim or contribute to unrealistic expectations. Emphasize the abuser's responsibility for his/her own choices. Let the victim blame themselves or other factors for the abuse. Expect the \"honeymoon\" period to emerge following an abusive episode. Delay in responding to a reported incident of violence. Timing is a key factor in gathering evidentiary information. Challenge the victim's explanation of the incident and openly ask if their partner is hurting them. The approach must be sensitive and not threatening in nature. Accept unexplained injuries accompanied by implausible reasons. Be honest with the victim, especially about confidentiality issues. Make a promise you can't keep. Understanding Domestic Violence - Page 11 Understanding Domestic Violence - Page 12Danger Assessment * 1.

This lethality checklist is taken from The Magistrate Protocol for Domestic Violence Cases. Understanding Domestic Violence - Page 13 Understanding Domestic Violence - Page 14Why Victims of Domestic Violence Stay and Go Situational Factors: Economic dependence Fear of greater physical danger to themselves and their children if they attempt to leave Fear of emotional damage to children Fear of losing custody of children Lack of alternative housing Lack of job skills Social isolation resulting in lack of support from family or friends and lack of information regarding alternatives Fear of involvement in court processes Cultural and religious constraints Fear of retaliation Emotional Factors: Fear of loneliness Insecurity over potential independence and lack of emotional support Guilt about failure of marriage Fear that partner is unable to survive along Belief that partner will change Ambivalence and fear over making formidable life changes Understanding Domestic Violence - Page 15 Understanding Domestic Violence - Page 16Signs to Look for in a Battering Personality 1. Possessiveness. At the beginning of a relationship, an abuser may say that jealousy (actually possessiveness) is a sign of love. Possessiveness has nothing to do with love. It is a sign of lack of trust. The abuser may question his partner a bout who she talks to, accuse her of flirting, or keep her from spending time with family, friends, or children. As the possessiveness progresses, he may call her frequently during the day or drop by unexpectedly. He may refuse to let her work for fear she'll meet someone else, or even enga ge in behaviors such as checking her car mileage or asking friends to watch her. 2. Controlling Behavior. At first the batterer will say this behavior is due to his concern for her safety, her need to use her time well, or her need to make good decisions. He will be angry if the woman is \"late\" coming back from the store or an appointment; he will question her closely about where she went and who she talked with. As this behavior progresses, he may not let the woman make personal decisions about the house, her clothi ng, or even going to church. He may keep all the money or even make her ask permission to leave the house or room. 3. Quick Involvement. Many battered women dated or knew their abuser for less than six months before they were married, engaged, or living t ogether. He comes in like a whirlwind, claiming, \"you're the only person I could ever talk to\", or \"I've never been loved like this by anyone.\" He will pressure the woman to commit to the relations hip in such a way that later the woman may feel very guilty or that she's \"letting him down\" if she wants to slow down involvement or break off the relationship. 4. Unrealistic Expectations. Abusive people will expect their part ner to meet all their needs. He expects a perfect wife, mother, lover, and friend. He will say things such as \"if you love me, I'm all you need, and you're all I need.\" His partner is expected to take care of everything for him emotionally and in the home. 5. Isolation. The abusive person tries to cut his partner off from all resources. If she has male friends, she's a \"whore.\" If she has women friends, she's a lesbian. If she's close to family, she's \"tied to the apron strings.\" He accuses people who are the woman's supports of causing trouble. He may want to live in the country, without a telephone, or refuse to let her drive the car, or he may try to keep her from working or going to school. 6. Blames others for problems. If he is chronically unemployed, someone is always doing him wrong or out to get him. He may make mistakes and then blame the woman for upsetting him and keeping him from concentrating on the task at hand. He may tell the woman she is at fault for virtually anything that goes wrong in his life. 7. Blames others for feelings. The abuser may tell his partner \"you make me mad,\" \"you're hurting me by not doing what I want you to do,\" or \"I can't help being angry.\" He is the one who makes the decision about what he thinks or feels, but he will use these feelings to manipulate his partner. Harder to catch are claims, \"you make me happy,\" or \"you control how I feel.\" 8. Hypersensitivity. An abuser is easily insulted, claiming his feelings are hurt, when in actuality he is angry or taking the slightest setback as a personal attack. He will rant and rave about the injustice of things that have happened, things that are just a part of living (for example being asked to work late, getting a traffic ticket, being asked to help with chores, or being told some behavior is annoying). 9. Cruelty to animals or children. Abusers may punish animals brut ally or be insensitive to their pain or suffering. An abuser may expect childre n to be capable of things beyond their abilities (e.g. punishes a 2 year old for wetting a diaper). He may tease children until they cry. Some studies indicate that about 60% of men who physically abuse their partners also abuse their children. 10. Sexual abuser. An abuser may physically assault private parts of a woman's body. He may show little concern about whether the woman wants to have sex and use violence to coerce her into having sex with him. He may begin having sex w ith his partner while she is sleeping. He may Understanding Domestic Violence - Page 17force her to do sexual acts that she finds uncomfortable, unpleasant, or degrading. He may demand sex after beating her. 11. Verbal abuse. In addition to saying things that are in tentionally meant to be cruel and hurtful, verbal abuse is also apparent in the abuser's degrading of his partner, cursing her, and belittling her accomplishments. The abuser tells her she is stupid and unable to function without him. This may involve waking her up to verbally abuse her or not letting her go to sleep. 12. Rigid sex roles. The abuser expects his partner to serve him. He may even say the woman must stay at home and obey in all things - even acts th at are criminal in nature. The abuser sees women as inferior to men, responsible for menial tasks, and unable to be a whole person without a relationship. 13. Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde personality. Many women are confused by the abuser's sudden changes in mood. She may think he has some sort of mental problem because one minute he's agreeable, the next he's exploding. Explosiveness and moodiness ar e typical of men who beat their partners. These behaviors are related to other char acteristics, such as hypersensitivity. 14. Past battering. The abuser may say he has hit women in the past, but blame them for the abuse (e.g., they made me do it\"). The women may h ear from relatives or ex-partners that he is abusive. A batterer will abuse any woman he is with if the relationship lasts long enough for the violence to begin; situational circumstances do not make one's personality abusive. 15. Threats of violence. This includes any threat of physical force meant to control the partner. \"I'll slap your mouth off,\" \"I'll kill you,\" \"I'll break your neck.\" Most people do not threaten their partners. Abusers will try to excuse their threats by saying that everybody talks that way. 16. Breaking or striking objects. Breaking loved possessions is used as a punishment, but mostly to terrorize the woman into submission. The abuser may beat on the table with his fist, or throw objects around or near his partner. There is great danger when someone thinks he has the right to punish or frighten his partner. 17. Any force during an argument. This may involve the abuser's holding the woman down, physically restraining her from leaving the room, or any pushing or shoving. He may hold his partner against the wall, telling her, \"You're going to listen to me.\" Understanding Domestic Violence - Page 18Domestic Violence and Children Children Exposed to Batterers Traits of Batterers \u0083 Controlling \u0083 Entitled/Self-Centered \u0083 Believe they are the victims \u0083 Manipulative \u0083 Good public image \u0083 Skillfully dishonest (e.g. say they \"don't remember\") \u0083 Disrespectful, Superior Implications of Entitlement Thinking \u0083 Leads abusers to think they are the victim \u0083 Will stop partner from attending to children so she can attend to him \u0083 Wants children to meet his needs \u0083 Increases a child's vulnerability when conditioned to meet adult's needs Implications of Good Public Image \u0083 Keeps people from believing partner and children \u0083 Abuser looks like sensitive team player \u0083 Confuses the children o believe no one else thinks anything is wrong with battering o Leads children to blaming the mom, because she is only one saying something is wrong Implications of Manipulation \u0083 Calm demeanor in court \u0083 File multiple harassing or retaliatory motions \u0083 Make false allegations against partner, (e.g. -f light risk, substance abuser, neglects children) \u0083 Use court process to avoid child support or get it reduced \u0083 Use parallel actions in different jurisdictions to gain advantage Batterers \u0083 Good early in a relationship \u0083 Externalize responsibility \u0083 Punish, retaliate \u0083 Batter serially \u0083 Danger increases post separation Understanding Domestic Violence - Page 19Information from Lundy Bancroft, author of The Batterer as Parent Batterer's Risk to Abuse Children Physical Abuse \u008350% of batterers abuse their children \u00837 tim es more likely to abuse their children than a non- battering parent Sexual Abuse \u0083Six tim es more likely to sexually abuse their children than a non-battering parent \u0083Correlated with presence of violence towards partner but not severity Post Separation Risk \u0083Abuse mothers during exch anges \u0083Use child as weapon for information on mo ther \u0083Phy sical, sexual, or mental abuse of child \u0083Child expose d to abuser's violence of ne w partner \u0083Learn attitudes and behaviors that lead to violence \u0083Batterer is no t focused on needs of child Understanding Domestic Violence - Page 20Domestic Violence The dynamics of domestic violence relationships Agenda What acts constitute Domestic Violence?

Understanding Domestic Violence - Page 26DVPOsDVPO S TABLE OF CONTENTS Ex Parte DVPOs - Bullet Points 1 Legal Issues in Domestic Violen ce - Outline 3 Chapter Parte DVPOs \u2014Bullet Points What It Is & When It's Available Primary relief sought by plaintiff is protective order issued by DC enforceable by contempt or criminal law Ex parte DVPO is supplemental remedy sought by plaintiff for purpose of protection during interval between filing complaint/motion and DC hearing. Ex parte DVPO issued following hearing conducted in absence of defendant. Magistrates may issue ex parte DV PO if Authorized by CDCJ Court is not in session No DCJ available within next four hours Ex parte DVPO expires at midnight of next day district court is in session. Ultimate Legal Question s Does it clearly appear from specific facts shown that there is a danger of acts of domestic violence against the plaintiff or minor child? If so, what relief is necessary to protect plaintiff/child from such acts? Has an act of domestic violence in fact occurred? Essential Elements Requires plaintiff to prove 1) Relations hip & 2) Act Firearms If plaintiff establishes right to relief, magistrate must inquir e about firearms. If any of 5 statutory factors are present, magistrate must order surrender of firearms. Remedy Magistrate must order defendant to refrain from further acts of DV, Magistrate may order additional relief necessary to protect the plaintiff/child. DVPOs - Page 1Custody Magistrate is prohibited from entering order related to temporary custody of minor children unless magistrate finds substantial risk of physical or emoti onal injury or sexual abuse. Plaintiff must provide CV -609 (Affidavit as to Status of Minor Child) Procedure If no complaint has been filed with the clerk, magistrate has authority to accept complaint from plaintiff. Find out how many copies of the order your office requires. Provide plaintiff with copy of order and deliver copy to sheriff for service. DOME STIC VIOLENCE SOME BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT TIC VIOLENCE PROT ECTIVE ORD ERS1 G.S. Ch. 50B creates a special kind of civil action in which the relief sought is protection from inju ry by the defendant, in the form of a coer cive order by a judge prohibiting the defendant from taking certain action s. If the defendant knowingly violates the order, he may be found in contempt of court for violation of a court order. As an alternative to being found in contempt, the defendant may be found guilty of the crime of violating a DVPO. A speci al kind of DVPO is available to a plaintiff who fears that she may be injured during the inter val between filing the complaint and the time the hearing is held. What statistical fact suggests that this conce rn of plaintif fs is often well-founded? A pers on seeking a DVPO has the option of asking for an ex parte DVPO as well. An ex parte DVPO is a protective order already in place befo re the defendant learns that the victim has filed for a DVPO. An ex parte DVPO is issued following a hearing conducted in the absence of the defendant. What concern does this raise in your min d? Magistrates never issue DVPOs, but in some counties magistrates are autho rized to deter mine whether an ex parte DVPO should issue. Autho rized magistrates may conduct hearings on requests for ex parte DVPOs only if (1) district court is not in sess ion, and (2) no district court judge will be available to conduct the hearing for at least four hours. Has your chief district court judge auth orized magistrates to issue ex parte DVPO's? Never Only during conferenc es or other relati vely rare occasions Theoreticall y, but we are strongly urged to use criminal charges when possible Yes 1 This outline refers to the victim of domestic violence as \"the plaintiff\" or \"she\", and the perpetrator of dom estic violence as \"the defendant\" or \"he\", but any of these terms may be inaccura te in a specific case. The terms are used consistently in order to avoid confusion, and were chos en because they are accurate in the majo rity of cases. In fact, though, a significant minority of victims of domestic violence are male. And because a person may seek a DVPO either by filing a civil action or by filing a motion in an already-existent civil action, that person may be a plaintiff or a defendant. DVPOs - Page 3 An ex parte DVPO issued by a magistrate is valid until midni ght of the next day district court is in sess ion. A district court judge will conduct another ex parte hearing when court is back in sess ion. The \"permanen t\" hear ing on plaintif f's request for a DVPO is re ferred to as the \"10 day hearing,\" After defendant is served with the complaint, a full hearing is conducted on whether plaintiff is entitled to a DVPO and, if so, what provisions the order should contain. The order entered by the district court judge after hearing the evidence is valid for one year, and may be extended at the end of that time for up to two years. A DVPO is available only to parties involved in a type of person al relationsh ip specifi ed in the statute. These rela tionshi ps are: --current or former spouses --pers ons of the opposite sex who live together or have lived together --parents and children,2 and grandparents and grandchildren. NOTE: no DVPO may issue under this section against a child under the age of 16. --pers ons having a child in common --current or former household members --pers ons of the opposite sex who are or have been in a dating relatio nship .3 2 Including those acting in loco pare ntis to a minor child. 3 A dati ng relatio nship is defined as a relatio nship in which the parties are romantically involved over time and on a continuous basis over the course of the relatio nship. DVPOs - Page 4Particular behavior qualifies as domestic violence only if the defendant: -- tried to cause physical injury; -- intenti onally caused physical injury; -- behaved in a way that caused the plaintif f, a member of her famil y, or a member of her househ old, to be afraid of imminent serio us bodily inju ry; -- behaved in a way that caused the plaintif f, a member of her famil y, or a member of her househ old, to be afraid that defendant will continue to terrorize that person to such a degree that the person experiences significa nt mental suffering. This behavior must be inten tional on the part of the defendant, and it must have no legitimate purpose .4 The statute refe rs to this behavior as harassment. -- committed any act defined as rape or sexual offense in GS 14-27.2 to 14-27.7. If a magistrate deter mines that it clearly appears from specific facts shown that there is danger of acts of domestic violence against the plaintiff or a minor child, the magistrate may order any relief necessary to protect them from such acts. [Note, however, additional showing required for order related to child custody.] If a magistrate finds that an act of domestic violence did in fact occur (i.e., the defendant committed one of the acts listed above against a pers on in a pers onal relationship protected by the statut e), the magistrate MUST enter an order which at a minimum prohibits the defendant from committing any further acts of domestic violence. And the magistrate must do one other thing as well: the magistrate must question the plaintiff about defendant's o wnership or access to firear ms. (Does the de fendant have access? Does the defendant own or have acce ss to ammunition? A permit to purchase firearms? A permit to carry a concealed firearm?) The magistrate must ask about the information above in every case, but in some cases the magistrate is required to go further and specifically order the defend ant to turn over to the sheriff all guns, amm unition, and permits within his custo dy or contro l. This order is man datory if any of the following facto rs are present: 4 The statu te specifically states that this behavior may include, among other things, written commun ication, telephone calls (includi ng voice mail), email, faxes, and pager messag es. DVPOs - Page 51) The defendant has at some time in the past used or threatened to use a deadly weapon. 2) The defendant has a patte rn of prior conduct involving the use or threatened use of violence with a firearm against people. 3) The defendant has made threats to seriously inju re or kill the plaintiff or minor child. 4) The defendant has threatened suici de. 5) The defendant has inflicted serio us inju ries on the plaintiff or minor child. The magistrate has autho rity to grant a wide range of additional relief to the plaintif f, depending on the parti cular circumstances of the case. These reme dies include 1) granting the plaintiff possession of the parties' shared residence, and ordering the defendant to leave the home; 2) deter mining which party has the right to possession of pers onal property during the time the order is effective, including possession of family pets; and 3) ordering the defendant to stay away from the plaintif f, as well as speci fic places such as the plain tiff's workplace and homes of family members. The magistrate is often asked to make a deter mination of tempo rary custody of minor children residing with one or both parties. The magistrate is explicitly prohibited by GS 50B -2(c)(1) from doing this, unless . . . . . . the child is exposed to a substantial risk of physical or emotional injury or sexual abuse. DVPOs - Page 6If a magistrate makes this finding, s/he may then go on to order that the defendant stay away from the minor child, return the child to the plaintif f, or not remo ve the child from the plaintif f. In suppo rt of this order, the magistrate must make a formal finding that the order is necessa ry for the chi ld's safety. ANSWERING QUESTIONS ABOUT DVPO'S Every magistrate should know the answe rs to the following questions, and those answe rs sometimes vary from one county to the next\u2014and one magistrate to the next, depending on your pers onality, the shift you're working, and other circumstances. Magistrates sh ould be guided by two fundamental principles in responding to these quest ions: Provid ing information to citizens about the court system's response to domestic violence is an important part of your job; and You have a respons ibility to be certain that the information you provide is accurate. 1. How do I get a DVPO? 2. Why should I cons ider a DVPO? 3. How much does it cost? 4. What do I have to prove to get one? 5. What if my spouse violates the order? 6. How long will it last? 7. Can I get one for my kids and family too? 8. Do I need a lawyer to get one? 9. Is there anyone that can help me fill out the forms? 10. When will my spouse find out about it? List other questions you've hea rd or can think of: 11. 12. 13. In many counties, the cler k's office or lo cal ag ency offering assistance to domestic violence has prepared brochures or other handouts providing victims with answers to these questions. In every case, the magistrate should be certa in that the citizen is info rmed that there are no court costs associated with seek ing a DVPO , and that an atto rney is not necessary to access these services. DVPOs - Page 7/g3 DVPOs - Page 8Chapter 50B. Domestic Violence. G.S. Ch. 50B was amended by the General Assembly in 2019 by S.L. 2019 -168. Because of their recency, those changes are not reflected in the following document. While the legislative changes are significant for district court judges, the do not directly affect magistrates' responsibilities under the statute. \u00a7 50B -1. Domestic violence; definition. (a) Domestic violence means the commission of one or more of the following acts upon an aggrieved party or u pon a minor child residing with or in the custody of the aggrieved party by a person with whom the aggrieved party has or has had a personal relationship, but does not include acts of self - defense: (1) Attempting to cause bodily injury, or intention ally causing bodily injury; or (2) Placing the aggrieved party or a member of the aggrieved party's family or household in fear of imminent serious bodily injury or continued harassment, as defined in G.S. 14-277.3A, that rises to such a level as to inflict substantial emotional distress; or (3) Committing any act defined in G.S. 14 -27.21 through G.S. 14 -27.33. (b) For purposes of this section, the term \"personal relationship\" means a relationship wherein the parties involved: (1) Are current or former spouses; (2) Are persons of opposite sex who live together or have lived together; (3) Are related as parents and children, including others acting in loco parentis to a minor child, or as grandparents and grandchildre n.

(c) As used in this Chapter, the term \"protective order\" includes any order entered pursuant to this Chapter upon hearing by the court or consent of the parties. (1979, c. 561, s. 1; 1985, c. 113, s. 1; 1987, c. 828; 1987 (Reg. Sess., 1988), c. 893, ss. 1, 3; 1995 (Reg. Sess., 1996), c. 591, s. 1; 1997 s. 2015 s. 36.) \u00a7 50B -2.

If the party is proceeding pro se and does not request an ex parte hearing, the clerk shall set a date for hearing and issue a notice of hearing with in the time periods provided in this subsection, and shall effect service of the summons, complaint, notice, and other papers through the appropriate law enforcement agency where the defendant is to be served. (c) Ex Parte Orders. - (1) Prior to the hearing, if it clearly appears to the court from specific facts shown, that there is a danger of acts of domestic violence against the aggrieved party or a minor child, the court may enter orders as it deems necessary to protect the aggrieved party or minor children from those acts.

(4) If the court determines that it is in the best interest of the minor child for the other party to have contact with the minor child or children, the court shall issue an order designed to protect the safety and well -being of the mino r child and the aggrieved party. The order shall specify the terms of contact between the other party and the minor child and may include a specific schedule of time and location of exchange of the minor child, supervision by a third party or supervised vi sitation center, and any other conditions that will ensure both the well -being of the minor child and the aggrieved party.

The Code cons ists of a Preamble and seven Canons (gen eral statements of overall principles), set out below. The complete Code contains a subst antial number of more specific provisions for each Can on; that document appears at the end of this section of the notebook. North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct Preamble An independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable to just ice in our society, and to this end and in furtherance thereof, this Code of Judicial Conduct is hereby established. A violation of this Code of Judicial Conduct may be deemed conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, or willful misconduct in office, or otherwise as grounds for disciplinary proceedings. . . .

Canon 4 Ethics-Page 1A judge may participate in cultural or historical activities or engage in activities concerning the legal, economic, educational, or governmental system, or the administration of justice.

Ethics-Page 2THE TEN BIG RULES1 1. When it comes to behaving honorab ly, a magistrate is a magistra te 24 hours day. 2. A magistrate's judicial duties must be given priority over all other activities. 3. An ethical magistrate is patient , dignified, and courteous to a ll those with whom s/he comes into contact with in the course of performing his or her responsibilities. ________________________________________________________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________ 4.

A magistrate may engage in civic and charitable activities and other public service, including teaching, writing, and public speaking, so long as (a ) the magistrate does not raise funds for the organization; and (b) his or her activi ties do not raise doubt about the magistrate's ability t o be impartial in performing th e duties of the judicial office. 8. Neither a magistrate nor any member of the magistrate's family should accept a gift or other benefit given in connect ion with the magistrate's offi ce. 9. A magistrate should never enga ge in direct fundraising. 1 Dona's paraphrase, offered for the purpose of structuring in-class discussion. The Ten Big Rules are certainly not to be relied upon instead of, or as a definitive restatement of, the Code of Judicial Conduct, which may be found in its entirety at the end of this Tab. Ethics-Page 310. A magistrate should not endorse, or contribute to the campaign of, any particular candidate for office. ________________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________ ________________________________________________________________________________________________ It might be said that a magistrate is most likely to run afoul of the Code of Judicial Conduct in three areas: (1) bias, (2) incompetence and/or lack of professionalism, and (3) abuse of power. Reading the Code from this perspective generates the following list of particularly important considerations for an inexperienced magistrate in approaching the duties of this new office: To avoid the appearance of bias: a. Be extremely careful about ex parte communications. b. Avoid mixing work with family, social, or other relationships c. Do not participate in any matter involving (in any way) a person within the third degree of relationship to you or your spouse. d. Don't hesitate to disqualify yourself in any matter in which your impartiality might reasonably be questioned. e. Keep your interactions with law enf orcement officers professional, being mindful of your differential roles. f. Eschew membership in organizations that practice unlawful discrimination g. Be unswayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism. Ot Or maybe the 3 big no-no's? Ethics-Page 4h. Be very careful about public comment on matters likely to come before you. To avoid the appearance of incompetence/lack of professionalism: a. Be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it. b. Maintain order and decorum in proceedings before you. c. Address parties by their appropriate title and last name and require them to address you in the same way. To avoid the appearance of abuse of power : a. Do not lend the prestige of your office to advance the private interest of others. b. Treat everyone who appears before you with patience, dignity, and courtesy. c. Do not engage in fundraising activity. d. Do not endorse anyone for public office (although you may attend political gatherings, be active in a political party, and make contribution s to the party). e. Do not accept a gift from a party, and avoid accepting gifts from parties who appear frequently before you or who are otherwise in a position likely to benefit or suffer from your decisions as a judicial for Ethics A magistrate is married to a police officer. Can the magistrate handle cases in which the officer appears before him or her? You arrive early to small claims court, as does a merchant bringing se veral collection suits. One of the defendants comes into the courtroom and sees the two of you chatting. Does your behavior raise ethical concerns? Your church asks you to serve as the head of its finance committee. Your duties would include raising money for next year's budget. Can you serve? The incumbent sheriff is running for re-election and asks you to endorse him. Can you? A local bail bonding company gives each magist rate a gift certificate to the local mall at Christmas? Can you North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct Adopted April 2003 The North Carolina Code of Judicial Conduc t is hereby amended to read as follows: Preamble An independent and honorable judiciary is indispensab le to justice in our society, and to this end and in furtherance thereof, this Code of Judicial Conduct is hereby established. A violation of this Code of Judicial Conduct may be deemed conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute, or w illful misconduct in office, or otherwise as grounds for disciplinary proceedings pursuant to Article 30 of Chapter 7A of the General Statutes of North Carolina. No other code or proposed code of judicial conduct shall be relied upon in the interpretation and application of this Code of Judicial Conduct. Canon 1 A judge should uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary. A judge should participate in establishing, ma intaining, and enforcing, and should himself observe, appropriate standards of conduct to ensu re that the integrity and independence of the judiciary shall be preserved. Canon 2 A judge should avoid impropriety in all his activities. A. A judge should respect and comply with the law and should conduct himself at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the in tegrity and impartiality of the judiciary. B. A judge should not allow his family, social or other relationships to influence his judicial conduct or judgment. He should not lend the prestige of his office to advance the private interest of others; nor should he convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence him. A judge may, based on personal knowledge, serve as a personal reference or provide a letter of recommendation. He should not testify voluntarily as a character witness. C. A judge should not hold membership in any organization that practices unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion or national origin. Canon 3 A judge should perform the duties of his office impartially and diligently. The judicial duties of a judge take precedence over all his other activities. His judicial duties include all the duties of his office prescribed by law. In the performance of these duties, the following standards apply. A. Adjudicative responsibilities.

(4) A judge should accord to every person who is legally interested in a proceeding, or his lawyer, full right to be heard according to law, and, except as authorized by law, neither knowingly initiate nor knowingly consider ex parte or other communications concerning a pending proceeding. A judge, however, may obtain the advice of a disinterested expert on the law applicable to a proceeding before him. (5) A judge should dispose promptly of the business of the court. (6) A judge should abstain from public comment about the merits of a pending proceeding in any state or federal court dealing with a case or c ontroversy arising in North Carolina or addressing North Carolina law and should encourage similar ab stention on the part of court personnel subject to his direction and control. This subsection does not prohibit a judge from making public statements in the course of official duties; from explaining for public information the proceedings of the Court; from addressing or discussing previous ly issued judicial decisions when serving as faculty or otherwise participating in edu cational courses or programs; or from addressing educational, religious, charitable, frate rnal, political, or civic organizations. (7) A judge should exercise discretion with re gard to permitting broadcasting, televising, recording, or taking photographs in the courtr oom and areas immediately adjacent thereto during civil or criminal sessions of court or recesses between sessions, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 15 of the General Rules of Practice for the Superior and District Courts. B. Administrative responsibilities. (1) A judge should diligently discharge his administrative responsibilities, maintain professional competence in judicial administration, and facilitate the performance of the administrative responsibilities of other judges and court officials. (2) A judge should require his staff and court officials subject to his direction and control to observe the standards of fidelity and diligence that apply to him. (3) A judge should take or initiate appropriate disciplinary measures against a judge or lawyer for unprofessional conduct of which the judge may become aware. (4) A judge should not make unnecessary appointments. He should exercise his power of appointment only on the basis of merit, avoiding nepotism and favoritism. He should not approve compensation of appointees beyond the fair value of services rendered. C. Disqualification. (1) On motion of any party, a judge should disqualify himself in a proceeding in which his impartiality may reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances where: (a) He has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceedings; (b) He served as lawyer in the matter in controve rsy, or a lawyer with whom he previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning the matter, or the judge or such lawyer has been a material witness concerning it; (c) He knows that he, individually or as a fiduciary, or his spouse or minor child residing in his household, has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding; Ethics-Page 10 295 (d) He or his spouse, or a person within the thir d degree of relationship to either of them, or the spouse of such a person: (i) Is a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or trustee of a party; (ii) Is acting as a lawyer in the proceeding; (iii) Is known by the judge to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding; (iv) Is to the judge's knowledge likely to be a material witness in the proceeding. (2) A judge should inform himself about his pe rsonal and fiduciary fina ncial interests, and make a reasonable effort to inform himself about the personal financial interests of his spouse and minor children residing in his household.

D. Remittal of disqualification. Nothing in this Canon shall preclude a judge fro m disqualifying himself from participating in any proceeding upon his own initiative. Also, a j udge potentially disqualified by the terms of Canon 3C may, instead of withdrawing from the pr oceeding, disclose on the record the basis of his potential disqualification. If, based on such disclosure, the parties and lawyers, on behalf of their clients and independently of the judge's par ticipation, all agree in writing that the judge's basis for potential disqualification is immaterial or insubstantial, the judge is no longer disqualified, and may participate in the proceedi ng. The agreement, signed by all lawyers, shall be incorporated in the record of the proceeding. For purposes of this section, pro se parties shall be considered lawyers. Canon 4 A judge may participate in cultural or historic al activities or engage in activities concerning the legal, economic, educational, or governmental system, or the administration of justice. A judge, subject to the proper performance of his judicial duties, may engage in the following quasi-judicial activities, if in doing so he does not cast substantial doubt on his capacity to decide impartially any issue that may come before him: A. He may speak, write, lecture, teach, participat e in cultural or historical activities, or otherwise engage in activities concerning the ec onomic, educational, legal, or governmental system, or the administration of justice. B. He may appear at a public hearing before an executive or legislative body or official with respect to activities permitted under Canon 4A or other provision of this Code, and he may otherwise consult with an executive or legislative body or official. C. He may serve as a member, officer or director of an organization or governmental agency concerning the activities described in Canon 4A, and may participate in its management and investment decisions. He may not actively assist su ch an organization in raising funds but may be Ethics-Page 11 296 listed as a contributor on a fund-raising invitation. He may make recommendations to public and private fund-granting agencies regarding activities or projects undertaken by such an organization. Canon 5 A judge should regulate his extra-judicial acti vities to ensure that they do not prevent him from carrying out his judicial duties. A. Avocational activities. A judge may write, lecture, teach, and speak on legal or non-legal subjects, and engage in the arts , sports, and other social and recreational activities, if such avocational activities do not substantially interfere with the performance of his judicial duties. B. Civic and charitable activities. A judge may participate in civic and charitable activities that do not reflect adversely upon his impartiality or interfere with the performance of his judicial duties. A judge may serve as an officer, director, trustee, or non-legal advisor of an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal or civic or ganization subject to the following limitations. (1) A judge should not serve if it is likely that the organization will be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before him. (2) A judge may be listed as an officer, director or trustee of any cultural, educational, historical, religious, charitable, fraternal or civi c organization. He may not actively assist such an organization in raising funds but may be liste d as a contributor on a fund-raising invitation. (3) A judge may serve on the board of directors or board of trustees of such an organization even though the board has the responsibility for approving investment decisions. C. Financial activities. (1) A judge should refrain from financial and busin ess dealings that reflect adversely on his impartiality, interfere with the proper performance of his judicial duties, exploit his judicial position or involve him in frequent transactions with lawyers or persons likely to come before the court on which he serves. (2) Subject to the requirements of subsecti on (1), a judge may hold and manage his own personal investments or those of his spouse, children, or parents, including real estate investments, and may engage in other remunerative activity not otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this Code but should not serve as an officer, director or manager of any business. (3) A judge should manage his investments and other financial interests to minimize the number of cases in which he is disqualified. (4) Neither a judge nor a member of his family residing in his household should accept a gift from anyone except as follows: (a) A judge may accept a gift incident to a public testimonial to him; books supplied by publishers on a complimentary basis for official or academic use; or an invitation to the judge and his spouse to attend a bar-related function, a cultural or historical activity, or an event related to the economic, educational, legal, or governmental system, or the administration of justice; (b) A judge or a member of his family residing in his household may accept ordinary social hospitality; a gift, favor or loan from a friend or relative; a wedding, engagement or other special occasion gift; a loan from a lending institution in its regular course of business on the same terms generally available to pers ons who are not judges; or a scholarship or fellowship awarded on the same terms applied to other applicants; Ethics-Page 12 297 (c) Other than as permitted under subsection C.(4)(b) of this Canon, a judge or a member of his family residing in his household may accept any other gift only if the donor is not a party presently before him and, if its value exceeds $500, the judge reports it in the same manner as he reports compensation in Canon 6C. (5) For the purposes of this section \"member of his family residing in his household\" means any relative of a judge by blood or marriage, or a person treated by a judge as a member of his family, who resides in his household. (6) A judge is not required by this Code to disclose his income, debts or investments, except as provided in this Canon and Canons 3 and 6. (7) Information acquired by a judge in his judicial capacity should not be used or disclosed by him in financial dealings or for any other purpose not related to his judicial duties. D. Fiduciary activities. A judge should not serve as the executor, administrator, trustee, guardian or other fiduciary, except for the estate, trust or person of a member of his family, and then only if such service will not interfere with the proper performance of his judicial duties. \"Member of his family\" includes a spouse, child, grandchild, parent, grandparent or any other relative of the judge by blood or marriage. As a family fiduciary a judge is subject to the following restrictions: (1) He should not serve if it is likely that as a fiduciary he will be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before him, or if the estate, trust or ward becomes involved in adversarial proceedings in the court on which he serv es or one under its a ppellate jurisdiction. (2) While acting as a fiduciary a judge is subject to the same restrictions on financial activities that apply to him in his personal capacity. E. Arbitration. A judge should not act as an arbitrator or mediator. However, an emergency justice or judge of the Appellate Division designated as such pursuant to Article 6 of Chapter 7A of the General Statutes of North Caro lina, and an Emergency Judge of the District Court or Superior Court commissioned as such pursuant to Article 8 of Chapter 7A of the General Statutes of North Carolina may serve as an arbitr ator or mediator when such service does not conflict with or interfere with the justice's or j udge's judicial service in emergency status. A judge of the Appellate Division may participate in any dispute resolution program conducted at the Court of Appeals and authorized by the Supreme Court. F. Practice of law. A judge should not practice law. G. Extra-judicial appointments.

Canon 6 A judge should regularly file reports of co mpensation received for quasi-judicial and extra- judicial activities. A judge may receive compensation, honoraria and reimbursement of expenses for the quasi- judicial and extra-judicial activities permitted by this Code, subject to the following restrictions: A. Compensation and honoraria. Compensation and honoraria should not exceed a reasonable amount. Ethics-Page 13 298 B. Expense reimbursement. Expense reimbursement should be limited to the actual cost of travel, food and lodging reasonably incurred by th e judge and, where appropriate to the occasion, by his spouse. Any payment in excess of such an amount is compensation. C. Public reports. A judge shall report the name and nature of any source or activity from which he received more than $2,000 in income during the calendar year for which the report is filed. Any required report shall be made annua lly and filed as a public document as follows: The members of the Supreme Court shall file such re ports with the Clerk of the Supreme Court; the members of the Court of Appeals shall file such reports with the Clerk of the Court of Appeals; and each Superior Court Judge, regular, special, and emergency, and each District Court Judge, shall file such report with the Clerk of the Superi or Court of the county in which he resides. For each calendar year, such report shall be filed, absent good cause shown, not later than May 15th of the following year. Canon 7 A judge may engage in political activity consis tent with his status as a public official. The provisions of Canon 7 are designed to strike a balance between two important but competing considerations: (1) the need for an impartial and independent judiciary and (2) in light of the continued requirement that judicial candidates run in public elections as mandated by the Constitution and laws of North Carolina, the right of judicial candidates to engage in constitutionally protected political activity. To promote clarity and to avoid potentially unfair application of the provisions of this Code, subsection B of Canon 7 establishes a safe harbor of permissible political conduct. A. Terminology. For the purposes of this Canon only, the following definitions apply. (1) A \"candidate\" is a person actively and public ly seeking election to judicial office. A person becomes a candidate for judicial office as soon as he makes a public declaration of candidacy, declares or files as a candidate with the appropriate election authority, authorizes solicitation or acceptance of contributions or public su pport, or sends a letter of intent to the chair of the Judicial Standards Commission. The term \"candidate\" has the same meaning when applied to a judge seeking election to a non-judicial office. (2) To \"solicit\" means to directly, knowingly and intentionally make a request, appeal or announcement, public or private, oral or written, whether in person or through the press, radio, television, telephone, Internet, billb oard, or distribution and circula tion of printed materials, that expressly requests other persons to contribute, give, loan or pledge any money, goods, labor, services or real property interest to a specific indi vidual's efforts to be elected to public office. (3) To \"endorse\" means to knowingly and expr essly request, appeal or announce publicly, orally or in writing, whether in person or throu gh the press, radio, television, telephone, Internet, billboard or distribution and circulation of printe d materials, that other persons should support a specific individual in his efforts to be elected to public office. B. Permissible political conduct.

Practical Tips for New Judges Making the Transition to the Bench By Judge Douglas S. Lavine Hon. Douglas S. Lavine was appointed to the trial bench by Connecticut Governor Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in 1993 and to the Connecticut A ppellate Court in 2006 by Governor M. Jodi Rell. The views expressed in this article are strictly his own. He can be reached at Dou glas.Lavine@co nnapp.jud.ct.gov. Congratulations! You have been appointed to the bench. I can assure you that you will find your new job to be enormously gratifying and challenging. You will have a rare opportunity to use your legal and personal skills, honed by the pra ctice of law, to serve the community. I can honestly say that I have enjoyed going to work on all but a few days of the nearly sixteen years I have been on the bench. Almost all of my judge friends feel the same way. With your new position comes a signifi cant passage. You are beginning something exciting, but you are also ending an impo r- tant phase of your life. You will be moving out of your previous comfort zone, one in which you may have had a high degree of control over your daily life and signif icant c onfidence in your abilities. In your new milieu, it is likely that almost everyone you deal with\u2014other judges, lawyers, court staff \u2014will in itially understand the way the system operates better than you. It will take time to adapt to your new surroundings i n what one writer has called the \"neutral zone \"\u2014a time of reorientation to new circumstances and surroundings.1 Be patient with yourself. In a relatively short period of time, you will emerge, like the proverbial butterfly from the cocoon, relaxed and conf ident, ready to fly. Everyone will call you \"Your Honor, \" doors will be held open, and lawyers will laugh at your jokes \u2014even when they are not funny. Especially when they are not funny. You will carry an elevated status in your community, particularly in t he legal world you inhabit. People will view you di fferently, and you will view yourself differently. You will be held to higher, more exacting standards. Everyone will stand when you enter the cour troom. I have a colleague who recalled the first time she headed out onto the bench. Everyone stood. She reflexively turned around, asking herself, \"Whom are they standing for? \" From now on, they will be standing for you. This is heady stuff and can result in a severe attack of early onset robitis, a dreaded dise ase sometimes afflicting new judges which I will discuss later. It takes some time to adjust. Presumably, mentors, colleagues, and others you trust will offer advice. Like everyone who came before you, you will need to find your own way. No matter the adv ice you receive from other judges, every decision you make will be your own. It will become part of your judicial DNA. I wish you the best in ruling on the myriad issues you will confront over the years, issues often critical in the lives of the people who come before you and in the communities in which you live. I do not claim to have any sage advice when it comes to the art of judging. But in more than fifteen years on the bench \u2014 thirteen as a trial judge, and almost three on the Connecticut Appellate Cou rt\u2014I have learned a few things about how to deal with recurring issues, some on the bench and many off, that you are sure to encounter. I claim to speak for no one but myself and underscore that the points raised here are based on my own experiences and ob servations, and sometimes, mistakes. As a judicial colleague, I hope these nuts -and-bolts suggestions will help you successfully cope with some of the mundane issues that you will face in your new role. Dealing with Friends Some people will take your new status in stride. But others, including people you have known your whole life, may act di f- ferently. Some acquaintances might be a bit standoffish or appear to be slightly intimidated. Others will tease you about ha v- ing all the answers. Dealing with lawyer friends and colleagues \u2014people you used to practice with or against \u2014will present special challenges, especially when faced with issues of recusal or disqualification. It is important to be familiar with profe s- sional requirements relating to these issues. I recommend speaking to experienced judges with a good sense of local pra c- tices and mores before making recusal or disqualification decisions. Of course, judges have a duty not to remove themselves from a case merely because a motion has been made. But expe rience teaches that even if litigants lose their cases, they can accept their disappointment if they think they have had a fair hearing. Appearances matter. Obviously every case is di f- ferent, but be very careful about remaining in a case if your fairness o r objectivity can be reasonably questioned. You must be the guardian of your own reputation for fairness and impartiality. The Line Between Public and Private Behavior In a nutshell, it is best, under most circumstances, to act as if this line no longer e xists. What I mean is this: whatever you say and do, an ywhere and to anyone, can be grist for the mill if it reflects upon your fitness to dispense justice. I suggest the following approach: except, pe rhaps, when dealing with immediate family and friends, imagine that what you say or do will appear in your local newspaper. Much as you may try, you really cannot be a judge just during the hours you are at court, or in your chambers. You are a judge all the time. Let me give a few h ypotheticals. (1) Every yea r, prior to your appointment, you have hosted a big party at which alcohol is served. In the past, if someone was stopped on the way home for a DUI, it might have been a cause for concern. Now, it could mushroom into a major career blemish. (2) In the past , you sat and smiled uncomfortably when someone told an inappropriate joke. Now, doing or saying nothing might be understood by ot h- Ethics-Page 17Published in The Judges' Journal, Volume 48, Number 1, Winter 2009. \u00a9 2009 by the American Bar Association.

This information or any portion thereof may not be copied or disseminated in any form or by any means or stored in an electronic database or retrieval system without the express written consent of the American Bar Association. ers to be an endorsement of the offensive attitudes expressed by the teller of the joke. (3) In the past, when someone was tailgating at high speeds you might have been tempted to slow down, or yell at them, or gesticulate. Now, taking any of these actions could lead to an allegation that you exhibited \"road rage \" and lack appropriate judicial temperament. (4) In the past, you m ight talk freely in an elevator no matter who was in it. Now, any words you utter could have an impact on a case or a juror or could be repeated in another courtroom. The simple truth is this: the line between private and public behavior has become blurre d beyond recognition now that you are a judge. As a judge, you are a public figure. Your private conduct, therefore, is of interest to the public \u2014and the press. Therefore, you must conduct yourself with the utmost care in private matters as well as public. Requests for Legal Advice Here is the usual scenario. You are at a party when the friend of a friend approaches you, introduces himself, and states he knows you are a judge. He makes small talk. He says that he knows you are not allowed to give legal adv ice. Actually, he tells you, he is not seeking legal a dvice, but he has just one question, and maybe you can assist. It seems that his brother -in- law has been kicked out of the house by his spouse and he wants to go in to get his clothes and other personal belongings. Any problem? Or \"a friend 's son \" got caught in the school bathroom smo king marijuana and was manhandled by the school 's personnel. Can 't they sue the school? Or his elderly mother got this speeding ticket and . . . . You get the idea. As a law yer, you have undoubtedly dealt with such questions throughout the years. But as a judge, it becomes more important still that you absolutely, positively say or do nothing that could be construed \u2014or misconstrued \u2014as giving legal advice. First of all, judges are prohibited from giving such advice. Secondly, it is not uncommon for laypeople to misunderstand or misinterpret legal concepts \u2014or to hear what they want to hear. So even if you decide to be polite and give some seemingly innocuous counsel with a discl aimer, the disclaimer is likely to be ignored. The last thing you want to learn is that Joe Smith 's friend went into criminal court and told the judge that he went into the house to retrieve his belongings because \"Judge Jones told me I could. \" My advice? Tell the simple truth. Explain that you would like to be of assistance but that you are strictly prohi b- ited, for professional reasons, from giving legal advice. And never, ever succumb to the temptation to do so. Mentioning that You Are a Judge Years ag o, I worked as an assistant U.S. attorney. Often, I would be sitting next to someone on an airplane and the co n- versation would be r elaxed and friendly until I mentioned that I was a prosecutor. Then everything stopped. I always a s- sumed that people thought that I would init iate a tax investigation if they said the wrong thing. In your new role, people will react differently to you when they learn you are a judge. Some people will want to treat you more favorably because of your position. My advice is to resi st, except in social situations where the subject arises naturally, the temptation to tell people that you are a judge unless you are asked. What that means is this. (1) If you are on a waiting list at a local restaurant, do not mention that you are a judg e in the hope of getting seated before your time, and don 't permit your spouse, significant other, or partner to do so either. (2) If you are pulled over for speeding, do not disclose that you are a judge in the hope of gaining favored trea tment. And do no t put your judicial credentials next to your driver 's license so the officer will inevitably discover that you are a judge. (3) If your spouse has a dispute with the local mechanic because he charged more than he said he would, do not make that angry phone call claiming that, as a judge, you know what he is doing is unlawful, a violation of co n- sumer protection laws, that you decided a case just like this, etc. (4) If your child is arrested for possession of marijuana, do not try to use your status to obtain preferential treatment for him or her. And so on. The bottom line is that the inappropriate use of your position to obtain special treatment is an abuse of power. Charities Some people will try to use your pres ence at an event or your name on a letterhead to raise funds. No matter how worthy the charity or cause, this should be resisted. Check relevant ethical rules, guidelines, and decisions to determine to what e x- tent you can be involved in charitable events, including those with which you have had a long -time involvement. Political Activities Different considerations may apply, of course, in states in which judges are elected. But for appointed judges in places like Connecticut, the rule is simple. Political activity is strictly verboten. Avoid rallies, fund -raisers, making contributions, bumper stickers, and signs or posters on your lawn. If your spouse is involved in politics, steer clear of situations in which it appears that you yourself are engaging in po litical conduct. Email It is probable that at home you have received unsolicited email that is offensive to you. Be careful not to allow any such unsolicited material to be forwarded to your work computer. When writing email messages at work, avoid langu age that would embarrass you if printed in the local newspaper. Tell friends and colleagues not to send you jokes, articles, and pi c- tures at work. When online at work, avoid sites or searches that could call up offensive material. Use your home computer to communicate with friends to avoid contamination of your work computer.

Work Interactions All of your contacts with everyone in the work setting should be polite, professional, and courteous. You are a role model and should set the appropriate tone. This includes lawyers, secretaries, marshals, probation officers, the cleaning crew, fa m- ily relations officers, stenographers, court reporters, members of the public, foreign visitors, school children on a class trip \u2014 virtually everyone. Court systems are huge echo cha mbers. Everything you say and do is grist for the mill. Rumors and a n- ecdotes fly from court to court. If you are rude or inconsiderate, that will be known to everyone quickly. Jokes or comments that might have been appropriate in your past life, wh en talking to longtime associates or e mployees, are better left unsaid in your new role. Discussing Cases or Opinions in Public The scenario is a familiar one. You are out to lunch with judge friends and the discussion turns to a trial you are presiding over. You offer a few tart opinions on the performance of a lawyer or the merits of the case. Oops! You didn 't notice, but in the next booth is the very lawyer you have been discussing, or the plaintiff, or a juror. The prospect of a mistrial in your first trial now dangles before you. Be very, very discreet when discussing legal matters, particularly a case, with a colleague. Talking about cases or decisions in a public setting \u2014a restaurant, a hallway, an elevator \u2014frequently invites disaster. Sim i- larly, do not leave files, drafts of opinions, or anything else relating to a case lying around \u2014in a car, at a restaurant, or an y- where. Ruling Before You Are Ready Your job is now to analyze arguments and make decisions. In a variety of settings, the problems req uiring a decision will come at you very quickly. Nonetheless, my advice is to never rule unless you are comfortable with what you are doing. It is often said that lawyers prefer a timely decision, any decision, even if it is at odds with their positions, t o being forced to wait. And there will be times when numerous factors \u2014a heavy docket, a crowded court, the presence of people who have come from a long distance to attend a proceeding \u2014will militate toward just ruling and moving on. I am not counseling timidity or indecision. But if that little internal voice that sometime speaks to you tells you that you are not ready to rule, listen to it. Take a recess. Hear more argument and think it over. Seek out advice from a senior colleague. Order ad ditional briefs. Or just sleep on it. Very few decisions are so urgent that they cannot wait a few more hours or days. Expressions of Personal Opinions on the Bench During my first judicial assignment, a crusty veteran gave me two bits of advice. First, h e said, always stop in the bat h- room before going out onto the bench. Second, KYBMS \u2014Keep Your Big Mouth Shut. I leave to you whether you choose to follow his first bit of advice. But over the years I have come to appreciate his blunt advice about keeping pe rsonal comments and observations to an absolute minimum. Plea santries are okay. Occasional conversation can be alright. But always r e- member that we are not being paid to express our personal or political views on the matters of the day or share our thought s on the pennant race, the state of the economy, or anything else. Nor are we a sort of master of ceremonies in a robe, presi d- ing over an entertainment event. Except for court personnel, lawyers and the like, the people in the courtroom almost always do no t want to be there. They are a captive audience. It is, frankly, somewhat egocentric to think otherwise and an abuse of your authority to force people to listen to opinions they would just as soon not hear. Humor on the Bench or in Written Opinions Off th e bench, a lively and irreverent sense of humor can be charming. I used to think I was funny until my now -twenty - two-year-old daug hter somewhere back in the eighth grade or so stopped laughing at my jokes and just sighed. But on the bench, or in written op inions, joke -telling runs the risk of detracting from the solemnity of the proceedings, being boorish, and veering off into abusiveness. A joke \u2014particularly at someone 's expense \u2014may earn you snickers from some observers, but what seems funny to you will be deeply offensive to someone else. Criminal defendants, litigants in a divorce, plaintiffs in a malpractice case, and others forced into court, see nothing at all humorous about their situation. Never forget that for most people, a court case represents a traumatic event and frequently involves matters of the utmost importance in their lives. Even when you are acting with the best of intentions or trying to lessen the tension in the courtroom, attempts at humor are almost always likely to be misunderstood. My advice? Avoid the laugh lines; think it, but don 't say it. The same applies to written opinions. Jokes, or opinions in verse, may seem clever when written, but they are not likely to seem funny to the pe o- ple on the receiving end whose cases you are dec iding. Treating Everyone with Courtesy and Respect You should strive to treat everyone \u2014underline everyone \u2014with patience, courtesy, and respect. This includes the corpor a- tion president and the convicted felon, the elderly alcoholic and the star athlete, th e pro se litigant and the top flight lawyer. You speak for the community, so at times, you will be required to make harsh decisions \u2014particularly when sentencing d e- fendants convicted of serious crimes. But even as you voice the community 's concerns, there i s never a reason to treat an y- Ethics-Page 19Published in The Judges' Journal, Volume 48, Number 1, Winter 2009. \u00a9 2009 by the American Bar Association.

Your job is to set the appropriate tone of dignity and fairness in the courtroom and to apply the rul es fairly to ever y- one. Dealing with the Media How do you deal with the media? With extreme care. This is particularly the case if you receive a call asking you to co m- ment on a pending matter. In most, if not all, jurisdictions, judges are prohibited from commenting on a pending case. In many jurisdictions, the judicial branch will have designated a person to handle calls and manage press relations. If you are uncomfortable returning reporters ' calls, you can delegate that job to someone else. However, as a former reporter who co v- ered legal matters, I can attest to the fact that often reporters are working under tight deadlines. Therefore, even if you ca n- not or do not wish to comment, the courteous thing to do is to return the call personally or to direct s omeone else to do it so that the reporter is informed that you cannot, or will not, comment. Robitis We turn now to the dreaded disease, robitis. Robitis is defined as a condition that befalls a judge when he or she dons a robe which causes the judge to assume a self -important, arrogant attitude. In your years in practice, you have undoubtedly practiced b efore judges with this dreaded affliction. Robitis can be fatal to a judge 's career. Friends and colleagues will probably be reticent to tell you if you have come down with it. Figure out a way to have someone \u2014perhaps a mentor or more experienced colleague who you respect \u2014close the door and tell you if you are showing symptoms of the disease. Co m- ments from lawyers and jurors, if you have access to them, can be helpful. If you see a recurring theme emerging in these comments, resist the human urge to resent them and ignore them. Also try to step outside of yourself \u2014mentally \u2014on occ a- sion, look dispassionately down at your own behavior, and ask yourself if you like what you see. Your work is important; take it seriously. Try not to take yourself too seriously. A touch of humility goes a long way. So does a willingness to acknowledge that you have made a mi stake or misunderstood an argument or would like to be educated on a point of law. Ethical Concerns You must be the guardian of your own integrity and reputat ion. Friends and family may ask you to do things not unde r- standing that a di fferent set of rules applies to you. My wife still makes fun of me when we are walking our dogs because I refuse to walk over a small patch of waterfront property near our home tha t has a \"No Trespassing \" sign posted. Explain to your family in emphatic terms that you are now living under a set of rules that is different from other people 's and that you need to be scrupulous in ways that others may find excessive. Periodically revie w the Code of Judicial Conduct. When in doubt about the propriety of conduct, check with a senior colleague or a designated person in your judicial branch. Keep your ethical antennae up. Never do anything if you have qualms about its propriety. A Final Comment Again, congratulations to you. I guarantee that you will love being a judge. It is an honor and a privilege to be appointed or elected a judge. It is also a great responsibility. I wish you the best. I hope these suggestions are helpful to you as b egin this exciting passage. Endnote 1. WILLIAM BRIDGES , TRANSITIONS : MAKING SENSE OF LIFE'S CHANGES (1980). Ethics-Page 201 JUDICIAL ETHICS AND SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES Michael Crowell UNC School of Government August 2012 (Updated) One of the significant developments in communication in recent years is the astounding growth of social networking websites. Huge numbers of people have join ed Facebook or LinkedIn or Twitter or other on-line social networks as a means to notify others of news in their lives, to learn what their friends and relatives and acquaintances are doing, and to generally stay in touc h with other people with whom they have something in common . Businesses, organizations and government agencies use social networks to communicate information about their products and services and get limited feedback. For individuals, and for some kinds of organizations, the appeal of such sites is the opportunity for ongoing back-and-forth communication among large groups of people . Typically a social network allows someone to post a profile and photographs, videos, music, etc., and in vite others to become \"friends\" or \"fans.\" Some information may be shared with the whole world; other parts may be restricted to a select, small group. As with the general population, the number of judge s using social media sites continues to increase. A 2012 report says that 46.1 percent of judges surveyed use a social media profile site. Among those judges, Facebook is most popular, being the choice of 86.3 percent of the users. For some time now state bar regulatory agencies have been addressing the effect of electronic communication on traditional ethical rules for lawyers the extent to which law firm websites constitute advertising, whether e-mail inquiries establish an attorney/client relationship, and so on. Likewise, judges hearing cases have faced new legal issues involving electronic discovery and searches of computers . Judges are becoming familiar, too, with problems of jurors communicating with the outside world and conducting their own research via their smart phones and other devices. Until recently, though, there has been relatively little reference material for judges concerning their own social networking and the Code of Judicial Conduct. The purpose of this paper is to share some information addressing questions of judges' personal use o f social networks. I welcome any additional material anyone knows about. Ethics-Page 212 Judges' use of social networks A good overview of social networking issues for judges appears in an April 30, 2010, on-line article from Slate entitled \" Tweet Justice .\" The article reports that some judges search Facebook and other sites to check on what lawyers and parties are up to, and it tells of one judge who requires all juveniles appearing before her to friend her on Facebook or MySpace so she can monitor their activities. As the article says, the new social media can generate ethical issues for judges. One question is the appearance created by a judge and lawyer \"friending\" each other on a social network. Another potential pitfall is the increased opportunity for ex parte communication. The article cites a North Carolina judicial discipline case arising from a Facebook friendship. North Carolina disciplinary case The North Carolina disciplinary case mentioned in the Slate article is an April 2009 reprimand issued by the Judicial Standards Commission . The judge and lawyer had decided at the beginning of a child custody/support proceeding to friend each other on Facebook and then exchanged comments about the case on the social network. That contact led to the reprimand for ex parte communication. The judge was also reprimanded for his independent research on the parties, without informing either side, through his visits to the wife's business website, a photography business where she posted both photographs and poems. Articles about judges and social networks For another example of how a judge's use of Facebook can lead to trouble, there is the resignation of Georgia judge Ernest Wood as reported in both the ABA Journal . Another example, also reported in a local newspaper , involves a lawyer who served as a substitute judge in North Las Vegas. He was removed from the office once the district attorney discovered that the judge's MySpace page said one of his personal interests was \"Breaking my foot off in a prosecutor's ass.\" There a re also two articles on social networking in American Judicature Society publications, but they are not on-line. One is \"Judges and Social Networks\" in the Judicial Conduct R eporter, Vol. 32, No. 1, p. 1. The other is \"The Too Friendly Judge? Social Netwo rks and th e Bench,\" by Cynthia Gray in Judicature magazine, Vol. 93, p. 236 (May-June 2010). Ethics opinions The question of whether judges may join social networks and whether they may be social networking friends with lawyers, law enforcement officers and others now has been addressed Ethics-Page 223 by eight state ethics committees. All the opinions say that judges may join social networks, but they disagree on the propriety of friending lawyers. Florida, Oklahoma and Massachusetts say no; New York, Kentucky, South Carolina, Ohio and California say yes, though usually with qualifications. All the opinions warn judges about the potential pitfalls of social networks for embarrassment and damage to the dignity and integrity of the office. The short reviews of the ethics opinions below explain the issues that may arise under the Code of Judicial Conduct. Florida The Florida Supreme Court's Judicial Ethics Advisory Co mmittee's opinion 2009 -20, issued on November 17, 2009, received a great deal of publicity because it was one of the earliest opinions and because it concluded that judges may not add lawyers as friends on a social network. The opinions from several other jurisdictions have taken a different view, as discussed below. The Florida committee opined that a judge could join a social network and post comments and other materials so long as the material did not otherwise violate the Code of Judicial Conduct, but that the judge could not add as friends lawyers who appear before the judge, nor allow lawyers to add the judge as a friend. The committee further said that a judge's election campaign committee could post material on a social network and could allow lawyers and others to list th emselves as \"fans ,\" provided the judge or campaign committee did not control who could list themselves in that manner. The committee's concern was that the judge's acceptance of a lawyer as a friend on the judge's page on the s ocial network would violate the canon which prohibits a judge from conveying the impression, or allowing others to convey the impression, that a person is in a special position to influence the judge. The comparable provision in North Carolina's Code of J udicial Conduct is in Canon 2B. The Florida's committee noted that being listed as a friend as the term is used on social network would not necessarily mean that the lawyer actually was in a special position, but the listing would convey that impression. The original Florida opinion generated additional inquiries resulting in three follow-up opinions. The first is Opinion Number 2010- 04 which advises that judicial assistants may add as Facebook friends lawyers who may appear before the judge for whom the assistant works, so long as the assistant's Facebook activity is conducted independently of the judge and does not mention the judge or court. The next Florida opinion, Number 2010- 05, advised that candidates for judicial office are not subject to the original opinion and that they, thus, may add as Facebook friends lawyers who are likely to appear before them if elected. The opinion is based on the wording of the Florida Code of Judicial Conduct which specifies the portions that apply to candidates. Ethics-Page 234 Finally, the Florida Judicial Ethics Advisory Committee revisited and reiterated its support for its original opinion on March 26, 2010, with Opinion Number 2010- 06. The new opinion was prompted by several inquiries, two of whi ch proposed disclaimers on judges' Facebook pages and one of which asked about an organization's Facebook page. The committee advised, first, that a judge who is a member of a voluntary bar association which uses a Facebook page may use that page to communicate with other members, including lawyers, about the organization and about non- legal matters, and does not have to \"de -friend\" lawyer members who might appear before the judge. The opinion emphasized that the organization, not the judge, controlled the Facebook page and decided which friend requests would be accepted and rejected. One judge asked whether the concerns expressed in the original opinion could be addressed by including a disclaimer on the judge's Facebook page s tating that (a) the judge would accept as a friend anyone the judge recognized or who shared a number of common friends; (b) the term \"friend\" does not mea n a close relationship; and (c) no one listed as a friend is in a position to influence the judge. Another judge inquired about a similar approach, proposing to state on the judge's Facebook page that the judge would accept as a friend all lawyers who requested to be added. The Florida committee rejected both proposals and stuck to its original opinion. The committee majority said that the disclaimer failed to cure the impression that a lawyer listed as a Facebook friend had special influence. The majority observed that lawyers who chose not to use Facebook would not be listed as friends and that there was no assurance that someone viewing the page would see or read the disclaimer. A minority of the committee wrote a dissent, calling for withdrawal of the original opinion, arguing that judges are not prohibited from having lawyers as friends in the historic sense of the word and that adding a lawyer as a Facebook- defined friend creates no stronger impression of special influence than does ordinary socializing. The minority would advise that a judge may accept lawyers as Facebook friends and that any motion to require the judge to recuse because of that relationship would need to include additional specific allegations supporting the impression of special influence. South Carolina In October 2009 the South Carolina Advisory Committee on Standards of Judicial Conduct issued Opinion 17-2009 . With little discussion the committee said that a magistrate may join Facebook and be friends with law enforcement officers and court employees so long as the site is not used for discussion of judicial business. Ethics-Page 245 New York More extended discussions, tending toward the same result as South Carolina but with more helpful analysis and discussion, have come from New York, Kentucky, Ohio and California . The gist of Opinion 08-176 of the New York Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics, issued on January 29, 2009, is that there is nothing fundamentally different about a judge socializing through a social network and socializing in person, and nothing fundamentally different about communicating electronically rather than face to face. The key question for the committee was not whether a judge could join a social network but how the judge behaves on the network. The judge, said the committee, needs to be aware of the public nature of comments posted on such a site; the potential of creating the appearance that a lawyer who friends the judge will have special influence; and the likelihood that people might use th e judge's social network page to seek legal advice. The committee observed that in some ways allowing a person to become a friend on a social network is no different than adding the person's contac t information to a Rolodex, but still cautioned that when combined with other circumstances the friending can lead to the appearance of a close social relationship requiring disclosure or recusal. Kentucky One of the most extensive opinions is Formal Judicial Ethics Opinion JE- 119 issued on January 10, 2010, by the Ethics Committee of the Kentucky Judiciary. The Kentucky committee does not believe that being designated a friend on a social netwo rk by itself conveys an impression of a special relatio nship. The committee repeats the cautions of the New York opinion, though, and notes that \"social networking sites are fraught with peril for judges . . . .\" Personal information, photographs and comments that might be appropriate for someone else may not satisfy th e higher standards for judges. The committee also warns of the problem of ex parte communications and cites the North Carolina reprimand. California Opinion 66 from the Judicial Ethics Committee of the California Judges Association, issued on November 23, 2010, is well written and useful. The California committee concludes, with qualifications, that a judge may join a social network, even one which includes lawyers who may appear before the judge, but the judge must disclose the social network connection and must defriend the lawyer when the lawyer has a case before the judg e. As to whether a judge may friend a lawyer, the committee answers that it depends on the nature o f the social network and whether the lawyer has a case before the judge. If the social network is one limited to the judge's relatives and a few close colle agues and it is used for exchanging personal information, for example, the likelihood will be greater that the lawyer appears to have special influence . There is much less risk, by comparison, when the social Ethics-Page 256 network involves individuals and organizations interested in a particular subject or project, say a sports team or a charitable project, and the exchanges are limited to that topic. Regardless of the nature of the social network, however, the California opinion says the judge should always disclose tha t the judge has a social network tie to a lawyer and must recuse from any case in which a friend from the first kind of network, the more personal one, is participating. Even for the second kind of social network, the less personal one, the judge should de-friend the lawyer when the lawyer appears in a case before the judge. One issue the California opinion addresses but other s do not is the judge's obligation when others post comments on the judge's personal social network page. The committee says that the ethical obligation to avoid the appearance of bias requires the judge to monitor the judge's page frequently for such comments and to delete the comments, hide them from public view or otherwise repudiate anything others say that is offensive or demeaning. Leaving comments on the page can create the impression that the judge has adopted the comments. The California opinion also admonishes judges to not create links to political organizations or others that would amount to impermissible political activity . And the judge must be careful not to lend the prestige of the office to another by posting any material that would be construed as advancing that other person's interest. Finally, the opinion admonishes judges to be familiar with a social network's priv acy settings and how to modify them. And the judge should be aware that other participants in the social network may not guard privacy as diligently and may thereby expose the judge's comments, photographs, etc., to others without the judge's permission. Ohio The Ohio opinion is Opinion 2010- 7, issued December 3, 2010, by the Ohio Supreme Court's Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. It is the last opinion in the list of 2010 opinions . The Ohio opinion observes that there is no prohibition on a judge being a friend of a lawyer who appears before the judge, thus friending on-line cannot be an ethics violation by itself . The opinion notes the special risks associated with social networks for judges and advises that: (a) the judge must be careful to maintain the dignity of the office in every comment, photograph, etc., posted on the site; (b) a judge should not interact on social networks with individuals or organizations whose advocacy or interest in matters before the court would raise questions about the judge's independence ; (c) the judge should not make any comments on a site about any matter pending before the judge; (d) the judge should not use the social network for ex parte communications; and (e) the judge should not undertake independent investigation of a case by visiting a party's or witness' page. Finally, the Ohio opinion advises judges to consider Ethics-Page 267 whether interaction with a lawyer on a social network creates any bias or prejudice concerning the lawyer or a party. Oklahoma The Oklahoma Judicial Ethics Advisory Board issued its Judicial Ethics Opinion 2011-3 on July 6, 2011. Oklahoma supports the Florida point of view, that while a judge may participate in social networking sites the judge should not be social network friends with lawyers, law enforcement officers, social workers or others who ma y appear in the judge's court. In the panel's view such a relationship can convey the impression that the person is in a special position to influence the judge. It is immaterial whether the person actually is in such a position, it is the possible impression that matters, and in the opinion of the Oklahoma committee, \"We believe that public trust in the impartiality and fairness of the judicial system is so important that [it] is imperative to err on the side of caution where the situation is 'fraught with peril.'\" Massachusetts The last opinion issued is CJE Opinion No. 2011-6 from the Committee on Judicial Ethics of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Massachusetts relies on the Florida analysis in concluding that a judge may join a social network site but may not friend any lawyer who appears before the judge. \"Stated another way, in terms of a bright -line test, judges may only 'friend' attorneys as to whom they would recuse themselves when those attorneys appeared before them.\" Friending creates the impression, Massachusetts concl udes, that the lawyer is a special position to influence the judge. The Massachusetts opinion repeats briefly the warnings from other opinions about the posting of embarrassing photographs, the avoidance of ex parte communications, and the like, and also adds a new caution. It tells judges not to identify themselves as judges on the social network site, nor allow others to do so. Such identification would run afoul of the code provisions against using the prestige of the office to advance private interests, in addition to the problem of creating an impression that others are in a special position to influence the judge. Summary Although the number of opinions about judges and social networks is still small, there does seem to be a consensus building on several issues. There appears to be general agreement among the ethics committee that: (1) Judges may join on-line social network s. (2) Social networks create opportunities and temptations for ex parte communication that judges must be careful to avoid. Ethics-Page 278 (3) Judges are still judges when posting materials on their social networking pages and need to realize that the kinds of comments and photographs posted by others may not be appropriate for them. (4) Judges need to avoid on-line ties to organizations that discriminate, just as they are prohibited from joining such organizations. (5) Judges also need to avoid on-line ties to organizations that may be advocates before the court. (6) Judges need to avoid posting comments on social network sites or taking other actions on such sit es that lend the prestige of the judge's office to the advancement of a private interest. The ethics committees divide most sharply on the issue of a judge accepting a lawyer as a friend on a social network. The majority of the states opining on the issue to date conclude that friending does not by itself establish such a relationship as to imply that the lawyer has special influence and does not by itself require the judge to recuse from cases with that lawyer, although they recognize that a social network friendship may create such problems when combined with other circumstances. In the view of those states, being a friend of a judge on a social network is no different than being a friend in person and does not by itself lead to automatic recusal. On the other hand, the ethics committees of three states have concluded that a social network friendship is sufficiently likely to create the impression of special influence that it should be barred. Although such an impression of favoritism may be mistaken, the approach of those ethics committee is to err on the side of caution when it comes to appearances of fairness. Judges also should be aware of the security issues that come with social networking. A judge's page on Facebook or MySpace or other social netwo rk can provide lots of information to someone who is dissatisfied with the judge's decisions and wants to do harm. 8/10 /12 This paper may be used for educational purposes without permission.

Terms LOTS - Language(s) other than Spanish Limited English Proficient (LEP) individual - a person who speaks a language other than English as his or her primary language and has a limited ability to read, speak, write, or understand English Interpretation - the accurate and complete unrehearsed transmission of an oral message from one language to an oral message in another language Translation - the accurate and complete transmission of written text from one language into written text in another language Proper Role of Court Interpreter The interpreter's job is to render everything said in court from the source language into the target language Accurately without any distortion of meaning Without omissions and additions Without changes to style or register With as little delay or interference as possible OLAS-Page 1 The interpreter's job is NOT To explain anything to anybody To fill out forms To serve as a \"go between\" Interpreters have an ethical obligation to ask for repetition if speech is unclear In order to conserve impartiality and confidentiality, the interpreter should not be asked to be alone with any of the parties Interpreters may sight translate a form for an LEP individual, but may not advise the individual on how to complete the form or answer the indiv idual's questions . Do not use untrained bilingual individuals to interpret during court proceedings Using an untrained bilingual speaker to interpret during court proceedings creates potential conflicts of interest and may have a negative impact on the case Bilingual speakers who are not trained court interpreters are not aware of the role, the demand, the modes of interpreting, the ethics or rules of professionalism required of the court interpreter and therefore cannot interpret accurately and complete ly, which can significantly impact equal access to justice for the LEP individual Tips for working with court interpreters Speak to the LEP individual directly just as you would an English speaker - e.g., \"What time did you call the police?\" Use plain English, avoid jargon, and do not use acronyms Speak slowly and clearly with regular pauses between complete thoughts Ask one question at a time Do not ask interpreter to explain or summarize what is said Provide the interpreter with information about the case; the more information an interpreter has about a case, the better he or she can prepare and perform Do not ask the interpreter if the LEP individual understands what you are saying; the interpreter's role is to serve as a language conduit, not to asses s understanding In order to ensure the accuracy of the interpreting services provided throughout the proceeding, provide a team of two interpreters for any proceeding lasting two hours or more Interpreters must be given a break every 20 - 30 minutes to maintain accuracy Early identification of cases in which an interpreter is needed Early identification of the need for interpreting services in an individual case allows for efficient assignment, reduces the number of continuances for lack of an interpreter, and maximizes the possibility that litigants will understand what to do next in their case OLAS-Page 2 Use interpreter resources efficiently - share interpreters between criminal and civil courtroom calendars and schedule an interpreter only for the time the interpreter is needed; do not request interpreters \"just in case\" because their services are often needed in another county Failure to provide sufficient time to secure a qualified interpreter may result in a delay or postponement of the court proceeding if a qualified interpreter is not available How to Request a Court Interpreter The request process for both Spanish and LOTS interpreters is consistent statewide. A Request for Spoken Foreign Language Court Interpreter must be submitted to the Language Access Coordinator (LAC) for the county where the case is set to be heard at least 10 days in advance of the court appearance to ensure adequate coverage. More advance notice may be required for LOTS interpreters who are located out of state. The request form can be accessed at https://www.nccourts.gov/request- for-spoken-foreign-language-court-interpreter . Failure to cancel scheduled services with notice of more than 24 hours will result in cancellation fees. Alert the interpreter and LAC immediately if it is determined services will not be needed. Services Frequently Asked Questions for Judicial Officials [July 2018] Who is entitled to a court interpreter? The Judicial Branch is committed to removing barriers that hinder equal access to justice by individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP). The court should require an interpreter for any court proceeding involving a party in interest who speaks a language other than English as the primary language and has a limited ability to read, speak, or understand English. Who pays for the court interpreter? The Judicial Branch will provide a court interpreter at state expense and at no cost to the party in the following types of court proceedings: All court proceedings heard before the magistrate All court proceedings heard before the clerk of superior court All court proceedings heard before the district court judge All court proceedings heard before the superior court judge Who is considered a party in interest? Parties in interest in a court proceeding can be any of the following: a party; a victim; a witness; the parent, legal guardian or custodian of a minor party; the legal guardian or custodian of an adult party. How do I determine whether a person has limited English proficiency and needs a court interpreter? To help determine whether to require a court interpreter, the court should conduct a voir dire that asks open-ended questions that cannot be answered with a simple yes or no. Visit www.NCcourts.gov to access the Language Access Bench Card for suggested voir dire questions, the interpreter's oath, jury instructions , and general tips for working with court interpreters. What types of interpreting services are available? The Judicial Branch offers a number of language access services to meet the needs of LEP individuals, including staff court interpreters, contract court interpreters, telephone interpreting, remote interpreting, translation, and transcription-translation services. Certified staff court interpreters provide Spanish interpreting services 9 counties: Alamance, Buncombe, Chatham, Durham, Forsyth, Guilford, Mecklenburg, Orange and Wake. The court proceeding is scheduled for today, but no court interpreter has been scheduled. Is it possible to find an interpreter on such short notice? The request process set forth in the Standards requires a completed Request for Spoken Foreign Language Court Interpreter be submitted by counsel, if applicable, or court personnel to the local Language Access Coordinator at least 10 days in advance of the court date or as soon as the matter is placed on the calendar, whichever occurs first. Court OLAS-Page 5interpreters are often scheduled well in advance of the court date, so last minute coverage is unlikely outside of staff court interpreter districts. Attorneys should be instructed to submit a request for a future court date. Court personnel should assist with submitting the request on behalf of self-represented litigants. If parties bring friends or family with them to interpret, may we use those friends or family as court interpreters? No. Only court interpreters approved by OLAS may provide interpreting services during a court proceeding. Friends and family may help parties communicate with court staff outside the courtroom, but they may not serve as court interpreters. May court personnel who speak other languages serve as court interpreters in court proceedings? No. Court personnel who speak other languages may help parties communicate with court staff outside the courtroom, but they may not serve as court interpreters in court proceedings. Additionally, law enforcement officers, corrections officers, and attorneys may not serve as court interpreters in court proceedings. May I use telephone interpreting to conduct a trial?

OLAS-Page 8Guide to Interpreter Language Needed and Interpreter Used Indicators This document is designed to assist with the use of the interpreter language needed and interpreter used indicators in the following indicators should be used to indicate spoken foreign language interpreting services and sign language interpreting services for the deaf and hard of hearing. The interpreter language need ed and interpreter used indicators should be used for managing cases that need or use an interpreter, and should not be used solely for scheduling interpreters. Use of Interpreter Indicators If a case is coded as interpreter language needed, an interpreter should not automatically be scheduled for every setting of that case. Judicial officials, attorneys, and court personnel always should check the case file to determine who needs the interpreter and if an interpreter actually will be needed for the proceeding. For example, the victim in a criminal case who needed an interpreter during a trial may not be present during the defendant's subsequent probation violation hearing , so the court would not schedule an interpreter for the subsequent proceeding. Courts should use interpreter resources efficiently by shar ing interpreters between criminal and civil courtroom calendars, scheduling an interpreter only for the time the interpreter is needed and not requesting interpreters \"just in case ,\" as their services are often needed in another courtroom or county. What is a court proceeding? A court proceeding is any hearing, trial, or other appearance before any North Carolina state court in an action, appeal, or other proceeding, including any matter conducted by a judicial official. Who is a judicial official? A judicial official is a clerk, judge, magistrate, or justice of the General Court of Justice. Interpreter Language Needed Data Interpreter language needed indicates that an interpreter is needed for a limited English proficient (LEP) individual in a case.

Contact For procedural questions on the use of the interpreter indicators, please contact the Office of Language Access Services at 919 890-1407 or OLAS@nccourts.org . OLAS-Page 12Frequently Asked Questions: Interpreter Needed and Used Indicators When do I use the interpreter language needed indicator? If an interpreter will be needed for any court proceedings for any limited-English proficient individual, select the appropriate language from the interpreter needed section. For example, if the state's witness to a criminal case speaks Korean, indicate that a Korean interpreter will be needed by selecting Korean from the languages available under the interpreter language needed section. When do I use the interpreter used indicator? If an interpreter was used at any point during a court proceeding for any limited-English proficient individual, select Yes / Y from the interpreter used section. For example, if a magistrate used the telephone interpreting service to conduct an initial appearance, the magistrate would indicate that an interpreter was used during that proceeding. But, if a clerk used the telephone interpreting service to answer a general question about a court date, the clerk would not indicate that an interpreter was used because it was not during a court proceeding. What is a court proceeding? A court proceeding is any hearing, trial, or other appearance before any North Carolina court in an action, appeal, or other proceeding, including any matter conducted by a judicial official. Who is a party in interest? A party in interest is a party to a case; a victim; a witness; the parent, legal guardian, or custodian of a minor party, or the legal guardian or custodian of an adult party. Who is a judicial official? A judicial official is a clerk, judge, magistrate, or justice of the General Court of Justice. How do I use the indicators? The interpreter language needed and interpreter used indicators should be used for managing cases that need or use an interpreter, and should not be used solely for scheduling interpreters. Judicial officials, attorneys, and court personnel always should check the case file to determine who needs the interpreter and if an interpreter actually will be needed for the proceeding. For example, the victim in a criminal case who needed an interpreter during a trial may not be present during the defendant's subsequent probation violation hearing, so the court would not schedule an interpreter for the subsequent proceeding. Courts should use interpreter resources efficiently by sharing OLAS-Page 13interpreters between criminal and civil courtroom calendars, scheduling an interpreter only for the time the interpreter is needed and not requesting interpreters \"just in case ,\" as their services are often needed in another courtroom or county. May I change the indicators? No. Once the case has been indicated as interpreter needed or interpreter used, do not change the indicators unless it was entered into the system incorrectly. For example, if a law enforcement officer incorrectly indicates in eCITATION that a Spanish interpreter is needed, but the court determines that the defendant speaks Portuguese, not Spanish, the language needed indicator may be changed to Portuguese. If there are multiple LEP parties in interest to a case, for whom do I indicate that an interpreter is needed / was used? Because our current technology only allows for indicators at the case level (not by each event or party), indicate that an interpreter is needed based on the first request or indication that you received that an interpreter will be needed for the court proceeding for any party in interest. Indicate that an interpreter was used at the first court proceeding in which an interpreter was used for any party in interest. Who should set the interpreter indicators? Any person with update capability to the data systems that currently have the interpreter indicators (eCITATION, NCAWARE, ACIS, CCIS-CC, CCIS-DA, VCAP, JWise) should set the interpreter language needed indicator at the time of the first request or indication received that an interpreter will be needed for the court proceeding for any party in interest. Any person with update capability to the data systems that currently have the interpreter indicators (eCITATION, NCAWARE, ACIS, CCIS-CC, CCIS-DA, VCAP, JWise) should set the interpreter used indicator at the first court proceeding in which an interpreter was used for any party in interest. Do the indicators also apply to services for the deaf and hard of hearing? Yes. If interpreting services will be needed for someone who is deaf or hard of hearing, indicate that by selecting American Sign Language (ASE) or by selecting Other and indicate the language accommodation that will be needed. If interpreting services or accommodations were provided to someone who is deaf or hard of hearing during a court proceeding, indicate that an interpreter was used.
