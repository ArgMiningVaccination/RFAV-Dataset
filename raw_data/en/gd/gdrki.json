Also, this book examines the limits of narrative medicine, a field developed by Rita Charon that blissfully blends together the studies of literature and medicine. Narrative medicine is helpful to clinicians and caregivers when trying to understand patient's needs, but Flanagan recognizes the ethical challenges associated with narrative medicine when the patient has verbal and/or cognitive deficits. Through using Paul Ricoeur's models of selfhood and care as a framework, Flanagan argues that clinicians and caregivers can provide exemplary care regardless of the patient's verbal and cognitive deficits. Flanagan asserts that any clinician or caregiver should work with the patient, and their family, to ensure they are getting a valuable, constructive, and honest review of their life. Caring for patients as they are is the main focus of this book, and Flanagan stresses that connecting Ricoeur's concept of patient identity accompanied with narrative medicine can help improve the patient experience at the end of their life.Death is not easy for anyone to deal with. Regardless if you are the clinician or caregiver, death has a way to make you stop and think about everything going on in your life. In October 2020, I lost my grandmother, Dorothy, after a three-year battle with dementia. In my opinion, dementia is a horrible disease because it forces family members and friends to watch their loved one drift away slowly. Grandma Dorothy, or \"Dodo\" as we all called her, was my rock, my guiding light, my person. I still think of her often. During the last month of Dodo's life, we called upon the help and guidance of our local hospice care provider. Those caregivers helped our family in one of our darkest times. The hospice caregivers helped feed, bath, and comfort Dodo in her final days of life. They truly made a positive impact in the final days of Dodo's life. Shortly after Dodo's passing, I took time to sit down and read Flanagan's book centered on narrative medicine and hospice care. This book is beautifully written, and it allowed me to better understand the actions and judgment calls made by hospice clinicians and caregivers during the final days of Dodo's life. In the moment, and as a family member, my judgment was clouded because I was losing one of the most important figures in my life. Looking back, I realize how important hospice workers are at the end of a person's life and see clearly why Flanagan chose to explore such an important topic.This book contains five chapters. In chapter 1, \"Narrative Medicine: The Turn toward Narrative in Clinical Practice,\" Flanagan discusses reforms in medical education in the United States over the years.1 For many years, medical education was focused on healing arts and patient care, but more recently there has been a shift to education based on biology, chemistry, and laboratory science. Paul Ricoeur, and other narrative medicine scholars, have argued for a better model of both evidence-based and patient-centered health care practices. In chapter 2, \"Narrative Identity and Practice in the Hospice Model of Care,\" Flanagan highlights Cicely Saunders's work as it examines the concept of patient identity within the hospice model of care.2 Saunders, as a trained nurse, social worker, physician, and the founder of St. Christopher's Hospice in 1967, recognized the importance of care beyond physical pain. Saunders recognizes the term \"total pain,\" which is pain that includes physical, spiritual, existential, and psychosocial pain. According to Flanagan, total pain is something that can be managed by religious and spiritual care services. Due to Saunders's wanting to treat the total pain in a patient, hospice services now have social workers, chaplains, bereavement counselors, volunteers, and medical professionals on staff.In chapter 3, \"Narrative Ethics and Practice from the Patient's Perspective: Life Review as Ethical Self-Assessment,\" Flanagan reviews a specific form of narrative practice called life review.3 Flanagan explains that life review is a model of retrospective self-reflection that patients may engage in when facing the end of their lives. Life review signifies a form of ethical self-reflection where the patient can experience regret, grief over lost time, and a desire for forgiveness. Health-care chaplains commonly use life review as a narrative-based intervention to help patients cope with their spiritual and emotional pain during the end of their lives. In chapter 4, \"The Limits of Narrative Medicine for End-of-Life Patients,\" Flanagan analyzes the limits of narrative medicine due to patients' declining cognitive function and inability to verbally communicate during the end of life.4 Flanagan describes the elements of narrative selfhood and identifies levels of narrativity for patients as she speaks to how narrative concepts of patient identity can be understood as social rather than solely individual. Also, Flanagan touches on Ricoeur's view of social selfhood and how it is useful when working with patients who are unable to speak themselves.In chapter 5, \"Expanding Beyond Narrative: Hospitality, Accompaniment, and Companioning as Models of Presence with Patients,\" Flanagan acknowledges the ways clinicians and caregivers can attend to patients beyond narrative practices.5 Flanagan discusses the Christian practice of hospitality in the form of welcoming the stranger for those patients who cannot engage cognitively or verbally. She also reviews the contributions of Paul Ricoeur's view of accompaniment as a nonnarrative-based form of presence with the dying and theologically informed practice of hospitality. Not only is Flanagan concerned with managing dying patient's physical pain, she is also concerned with social isolation and loneliness, as well as psychosocial and spiritual distress as a manifestation of total pain. Overall, Flanagan wants to shed light on those patients who fall outside the patient population highlighted in current models of narrative medicine.There are many terrific things to praise about this book. First, Flanagan made an active decision to write about a population of people who often go unnoticed and unvisited at the end of their lives. It could not have been easy spending countless hours researching hospice care, hospice clinicians and caregivers, as well as religious and ethical practices within hospice care. Second, I appreciated how she focused on the work of Paul Ricoeur, as well as philosophers Rita Charon, Cicely Saunders, and Lisa Cahill. The models and philosophies Flanagan selected for this book were thoughtfully blended into her work to create important and purposeful arguments throughout. Finally, I found the layout and organization of the book to be phenomenal, making perfect sense to me as I turned the pages. From an overview and history, to identity and ethics, to the limits and what takes us beyond narrative medicine, the book's information flows seamlessly. I was effortlessly engaged.While I enjoyed the book overall, I did find myself wanting to hear more of the author's voice. Flanagan often uses \"I\" language, but I wanted her to show, not tell. I felt this book did a terrific job of talking about the strengths and limitations of narrative medicine, but I feel it could have been even more powerful with more of the author's voice. Narratives have power, and I felt the book could have had even more appeal with a stronger narrative voice incorporated throughout. That said, I do not want to detract from how well the book is written. Flanagan should be proud of this accomplishment.I recommend this book to researchers and educators interested in exploring narrative medicine in hospice care. Too often, as humans, we get caught up in the busy and exciting world around us. We forget about those who came before us, as we are so focused on our jobs, our friends, our daily responsibilities. Flanagan reminds us not only to remember but to work to comfort those who are often forgotten at the end of their lives.A sentence on the last page of the book stuck with me: \"By learning to be open to feelings of discomfort, a caregiver then will continue to interact with a patient even if the experience is not immediately rewarding.\"6 As we all progress through life and eventually encounter loved ones nearing the end of their lives, I hope we can all remember the importance of being there for them. Even if it is not immediately rewarding, being there with someone as they fade away, I hope we can all remember to embrace the discomfort and be there for those who need us the most. Thank you, Tara, for this important work.", "sitename": "University of California Press", "date": "2022-07-01", "cleaned_text": "in Hospice Care: Identity, Practice, and Ethics through the Lens of Paul Ricoeur, draws on both narrative practices and hospice philosophy as she invites readers to better understand ethical dimensions that occur between end-of-life care and religion.
