Address US Department of Education Response to Menu Waiver Request Assessment Values Not binding but guiding. Summarized primarily from the 2014 Board -Adopted Assessment Values In order to drive the Board's mission to develop successful citizens through robust public education, the assessment system should: Be valid, reliable, and unbiased and ensure a meaningful statewide accountability system Measure students' mastery and progress toward college and career readiness in alignment with the state academic standards Provide the same accessibility to assessments and accommodations for all students Provide data to parents, students, educators and policymakers in a timely manner to inform: the public, instruction, and policy Reduced testing by only testing as necessary to drive programmatic and systematic decisions Provide meaningful Menu options in high school pursuant to the state statute that also meet federal requirements US ED Waiver Response ARS 15 -741.02 requires the Board to adopt a Menu of Assessments that schools may select from and administer instead of the statewide assessment In December 2018, the Arizona Department of Education (ADE) made a request to the U.S. Department of Education (US ED) asking to waive certain federal requirements as it pertains to the Menu of Assessments. US ED declined the waiver request, placed Arizona on \"high -risk\" and directed Arizona to demonstrate by May 31, 2019 how the state will come into compliance or risk federal funds. This did not affect the 2018 -2019 school year. Specifically, this requires a single statewide assessment to be administered once to all students in high school. Additionally, US ED stated that a Menu of Assessments in grades three through eight is not permissible under federal law A Menu -like system in which an approved assessment is administered instead of the statewide assessment is possible but will require time and require the state to meet certain requirements 5-Year Assessment Plan Short Term: The Next Two Years SHORT TERM: To satisfy US ED's request and to continue with a meaningful assessment system, the following will be in place for the next two years (Spring 2020 and Spring 2021): Modify the name from AzMERIT to AzM2 Continue test question development and refinement reviewed by Arizona educators AzM2 in elementary school is status quo Administer a summative AzM2 in 10thgrade. Eliminate end of course testing in high school. Blueprint for AzM2 found on ADE's website: http://www.azed.gov/assessment//azm2 /. Test is more heavily weighted towards Algebra I standards (about 60%). LEAs may select an assessment from the Menu but all high schools must administer the renamed AzM2 in 10thgrade to all students regardless of the Menu choice The above aligns to the assessment values (reduce testing, feed into accountability, etc.) and complies with the federal request 5-Year Assessment Plan Short Term: The Next Two Years 2018 -2019 2019 -2020 2020 -2021 Elementary Statewide Assessment AzMERITAzM2 (Name Change)AzM2 (Name Change) Embedded Field Test New Assessment High School Statewide Assessment AzMERIT Grades 9-11ALL Students Take: AzM2 (Name Change) Grade 10 ALLStudents Take: AzM2 (Name Change) Grade 10 Embedded Field Test New Assessment ORLEAs may select instead of the statewide assessmentLEAs MAY administer one of the below in addition to the statewide assessment High School Option \"Menu\"ACT SATMenu Assessments (ACT, Cambridge, Pearson)Menu Assessments (ACT, Cambridge, Pearson and TBD Based on RFP) 5-Year Assessment Plan Long Term: The \"Vision\" Year and Beyond Elementary School (3 -8): All schools administer a new single statewide assessment after stakeholder meetings and field testing of new statewide assessment High School (9 -12): LEAs will have two assessment options The Board will adopt aligned nationally recognized assessments that offer: 1) a 9thor 10th grade preparatory test; and 2) an 11th grade college entrance test from the same vendor. This will be considered the statewide assessment in high school and what we assume most schools will administer. Pursuant to the Menu of Assessments statute and the locally selected option under federal law, the Board will also adopt an option for schools to select a different nationally recognized test that offers: 1) a 9th or 10thgrade preparatory test; and 2) an 11th grade college entrance test from the same vendor instead of the statewide assessment 5-Year Assessment Plan Long Term: The \"Vision\" Year and Beyond 2021 -2022 Elementary Statewide Assessment New Single Statewide Assessment High School Statewide Assessment Nationally Recognized College Entrance Assessment Administered in 9thor 10thGrade and 11thGrade ORLEAs may administer the below instead of the statewide assessment (dependent on factors listed in subsequent slide ) High School Option \"Menu\" Dependent on factors listed in subsequent slideDifferent Nationally Recognized College Entrance Assessment Administered in 9thor 10thGrade and 11thGrade The Full 5 -Year Assessment 2020 -2021 Students Take: AzM2 Embedded Field Test New AssessmentNew Single Statewide Assessment 3-8 Menu?

Discussions continue with the federal government on the feasibility of an elementary school Menu. High School Menu requires federal peer review, standards alignment, accommodations uniformity, and comparability of assessments for accountability. \"Vision Year\" in high school plans for meeting federal requirements in advance but if the federal government still rejects the Menu in high school, the plan provides for a single statewide assessment that meets many of the Board's values.

Phoenix College Prep Academy's AzMERIT scores have steadily increased within the last three years, rising above the state average, earning an 'A' in the grade system for the past two academic years . Phoenix College Prep Academy Phoenix College Prep Academ y curren tly has a waiting list for 2019 -20 school year therefore request an enrollment increase. We have already met our cap of 215 returning students because we have 75 confirmed students (incoming freshman) wi th completed paperwork. We have requests dail y from upperclassmen that would like to transfer if our enrollment increase is gran ted which would take our enrollm ent to 255 for the 201 9-20 school year and 300 for the 20 21-22 school year. Curre ntly our students have taken 600 college classes with nearly 1800 college credits last year at a cost of nearly $200,000 including books and tuition by the Summer Session. This yea r our students have completed 95 % of college classes with an 88% success rate (C or better). We would like to give this early coll ege opportunity to more students in the surrounding communities of the Phoenix Valley. Ninety -three percent of our students are first generation college students and over ninety percent are on free and reduced lunch; therefore, this enrollment increase wou ld greatly help more disadvantaged families in the Phoenix community.

Sincerely, Keith Brown Principal Maricopa County Community College District Governing Board Minutes May 26, 2015 A public hearing, special session, regular meeting , and executive session of the Maricopa County Community College District Governing Board were scheduled to be held beginning at 6:30 p.m. at the District Support Services Center, 2411 West 14th Street, Tempe, Arizona, pursuant to ARS \u00a7 38-431.02, notice having been duly given. GOVERNING BOARD Tracy Livingston, President Johanna Haver, Secretary Doyle Burke, Member Alfredo Gutierrez, Member John Heep, Member Jane McGrath, Member Dana Saar, Member ADMINISTRATION Rufus Glasper Maria Harper -Marinick Debra Thompson LaCoya Shelton Steve Helfgot Combs Linda Steven Gonzales Janet Langley for Irene Kovala Shouan Pan Paul Dale Paul DeRose for Chris Haines Chris Bustamante Jan Gehler Shari Olson Gene Giovannini CALL TO ORDER The public hearings were called to order at 6:31 p.m. PUBLIC HEARINGS The Maricopa County Community College District presented its proposed FY2015 -16 budget ($1.4 billion) for adoption. There was no proposal to increase tuition or property tax levy. President Livingston provided the opportunity to address the Governing Board concerning the proposed budget. One citizen and tax payer asked to present. Reverend Dr. Robin Hollis, from Valley Interfaith Project (VIP), mentioned she was a deacon of the Ariz ona Episcopal Diocese and said she wanted to recognize MCCCD and the role it plays in Arizona. She appreciates that role and she wanted to thank the administration for ensuring that Maricopa's families have a place to get a higher education and workforce d evelopment. She asked the Board to consider a few facts as it pondered its budget decision: MCCCD is the most affordable higher education opportunity for the community especially in light of the fact that approximately 68% of jobs will require post -seconda ry education by 2020. MCCCD also remains the largest provider of job training. With the State 's decision to winnow its support down to zero it sends the wrong message to the community. She hopes the State recovers its senses and re -engages support for high er education. There can be no greater investment in human capital than higher education. She applaud s the Board's courage and gives it thanks. The Maricopa County Community College District then considered the proposed budgets for GateWay Early College Hig h School (GWECHS) and Phoenix College Preparatory Academy (PCPA) for FY2015- 16. President Livingston asked the Vice Chancellor of Business Services, Ms. Debra Thompson, to present the budgets under consideration. Ms. Thompson asked the principal of GWECHS , Ms. Lisa Smith, to provide additional information. Ms. Smith reported that enrollment was expected to increase from 267 to 27 3. Average daily membership is expected to increase slightly from 262 to 265. State based funding per student increased slightly from $3,373.11 to $3,426.74. The State will provide $2,022.02 in additional funding (including an inflation rate of 1.59%) . The allocation of Prop 301 funds per student remains the same at $295 . All instructional programs and staffing remain unchanged and additional funding is earmarked for instructional materials and increased cost s of fundamental items (i.e., bus passes, paper, etc.) Minutes | May 26, 2015 Regular Board Meeting Page 2 of 9 Ms. Thompson then asked the principal of PCPA, Mr. Keith Brown, to provide additional information. Mr. Brown reported that enrollment was expected to increase from 90 to 120 (the maximum number of students the school can have is 100 although the Board is considering his request to increase the cap to 400 ). Average daily membership is expected to remain static . State based fun ding per student increased slightly from $3,373.11 to $3,426.74 . The State will provide $2,022.02 in additional funding . Prop 301 funds per student remain at $295. PCPA's budget is increasing in a few budget areas due to enrollment increases. The transport ation budget for 2015 -16 has increased due to more students. PCPA is hoping to add breakfast to its lunch program at no additional costs this year. President Livingston then provided an opportunity to address the Governing Board concerning the proposed cha rter school budgets. No citizens asked to present. President Livingston concluded the public hearings to adopt the proposed budget for FY2015 - 16 and to approve the proposed budgets for the two charter schools. Copies of the budget presentations are in the appendix. The Public Hearings were concluded at 6:50 p.m. SPECIAL SESSION President Livingston convened a Special Session immediately following the public hearings. ITEM 1.1 ADOPTION OF PROPOSED MARICOPA COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLE GE DISTRICT BUDGET FY2015- 16\u2014adopt proposed FY 2015 -16 Budget. The General Fund, Current Auxiliary Fund, Current Restricted Fund, and Plant Fund total $1.5 billion. Pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes, the proposed Legal Budget has been made available online on the District's main w eb page and was published in Arizona Republic on May 11th and May 18th. Some Board members asked to provide background on their decision : Mr. Burke: He asked the Board to consider strongly entertaining the notion to increase property tax levy and tuition next year. Mr. Gutierrez: He feels this budget reflects 'planned obsolescence' and if MCCCD goes into the future with a flat budget, many things will begin to take a toll on the district (e.g., inflation, demoralization of employees, and 'magically maintai ned' buildings). The Board has to consider the consequences. The costs are known (maintenance, not increasing salaries/COLA) so MCCCD knows what to expect. He votes 'aye' with great hesitation and hopes this Board realizes if this continues MCCCD may becom e a second -rate institution. Mr. Heep: He thanked the administration and Board for reviewing the budget process and the continuous plans to free up capital for continued growth in the district. Mrs. McGrath: She remarked this was the third budget she has p articipated in development of and the only one which was completed by someone else and presented to the Board and explained by staff. She cannot vote yes for something she had not role in. Mrs. Livingston: She thanked everyone who worked on the budget and said she was proud of it. She disagrees that it is planned obsolescence, rather it is time to think way outside the box \u2014time to get a little dirty and plan for what is next. MOTION Motion 10299 Board Member Saar made a motion to adopt Item 1. 1. Board Memb er Haver seconded. In accordance with state law, the Governing Board voted on this motion by roll call: Mr. Burke \u2014aye; Mr. Gutierrez Saar \u2014aye. By a vote of 6-1 (McGrath), the motion passed.

STUDENT LIFE REPORTS Rio Salado College (RSC) Student Life and Leadership (SLL) members approached the podium and reported on activities at the college. The purpose of SLL is to engage students in activities and organizations outside of their academics. Rio Salado may not offer traditional \"campus\" life, but it does provide many ways for students to get involved and add value to their academic experience. Students can be online and engaged by participating in the National Society of Leadership and Success (NSLS), Phi Theta Kappa International Honor Society (PTK), Student Public Policy Forum (SPPF), Be a Leader Foundation Mentorship Program, Chancellor's Civ ic Leadership Medallion, or Student Leadership Retreat. Students shared the National Society of Leadership and Success induction requirements ( orientation, leadership training day, three reflections on s peaker broadcasts, and t hree success networking team meetings) and what is required to be considered for a National Engaged Leader Award ( six reflections on s peaker broadcasts, six success networking team meetings, and f ive hours of c ommunity service). This is the second year of Rio's chapter. About 120 stud ents joined and 35 students were honored as inducted members. In total, 13 students received the National Engaged Leader Award. Students then went on to describe Rio's Phi Theta Kappa International Honor Society requirements: c umulative GPA 3.50+, 12 credi ts completed, currently enrolled at RSC, Phi Theta Kappa a pplication, and a m embership fee. Rio's PTK International Honor Society is a Five Star Chapter of the l argest honor society in h igher education and provides commencement student speaker candidates and c ommencement student marshal candidates. It hosted the PTK Honors' Institute for the Arizona Region and the Honors -In-Action Project with the City of Tempe Public Library focused on draw ing females into STEM fields. Opportunities on the horiz on include c reation of student clubs, expansion of Student Life participation at RSC l ocations , increased c ommunity service projects , new college mascot - related activities , and much more! RSC Student Governance Maheux , Jacques Osley . COLLEGE REPORTS Dr. Paul Dale , President of Paradise Valley Community College ( PVCC), remarked this report exemplifies the power of MCCCD's partnerships with employers, grants, and the leadership at the college. He then introduced Ms. Christie Colunga, Early Childhood Education faculty at PVCC, to speak. Ms. Colunga informed the Board that the AAS degree in Early Childhood Education offered by PVCC is accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). An explosion of research highlights the importance of early life experiences and the central role of early relationships ( From Neurons to Neighborhoods: the Science of Early Childhood Development , 2000). PVCC responded to several grant opportunities in 2010- 2015 including: Early Childhood Teacher Professional Development in Language Acquisition and Literacy, a Helios Education Foundation grant, which sought to update and unify Arizona's approach to language acquisition and early literacy by establishing foundational, standard college course work. Researcher, Dr. Eva Shivers, Indigo Cultural Center, Phoenix (2010 - present), with a grant award of $327,302; Central Maricopa Infant Toddler Project, a First Things First grant, which was a pilot program to im prove the quality of infant and toddler care and early education in the region using standardized and qualitative measure to determine effectiveness. Researcher, Dr. Diana Schaack, San Diego State University (2011- 2014), with a grant award (over five years ) of $1,200,000; and Professional Development for Early Care and Education Professionals, also a First Things First Grant, which featured community building through facilitated conferences and communities of learners, extended contact with experts in the f ield, and the use of protocols (2010 -2015), with a grant award of $896,543. Outcomes included students' ability to study with national and international leaders in the field. The Central Maricopa Infant Toddler Project aligned college coursework with the n ationally recognized Program for Infant Toddler Care. Thirty six teachers and nine directors Minutes | May 26, 2015 Regular Board Meeting Page 4 of 9 had the opportunity to enroll in six college credits aligned with professional development. They have seen incredible participation \u2014First Things First Professional Development for Early Care and Education Professionals Grant had approximately 600 a year for five years resulting in over 3,000 participants (duplicated count) from over 60 different early childhood programs that were given the opportunity to enroll in 2 4 different college courses.

Dr. Chris Bustamante, President of Rio Salado College (RSC), introduced Mr. Otis White, Faculty Chair for Business and Public Administration at Rio, who presented on the great partnership between MCCCD and industry partners (insurance). At the Insurance Industry Summit - April 2014, he learned that there are 7,000+ employment positions curren tly available in Maricopa County and in the next five to seven years this number will increase to 15,000. Insurance is a dominant industry growth sector in Arizona and nationwide and offers high paying jobs with a broad range of career options within the i ndustry. MCCCD works with an advisory committee comprised of 46 members and represent 23+ national and local companies and organizations. Committee members come from RSC, MCC, GCC, NAU, and the National Industry Education Organizations.

Minutes | May 26, 2015 Regular Board Meeting Page 5 of 9 EMERITUS , AWARDS , AND RECOGNITION Dr. Ernie Lara , President of Estrella Mountain Community College ( EMCC), thanked the Board and asked EMCC's Dean of Academic Affairs, Ms. Kathleen Iudicello, to help present a Vice President Emeritus Distinction to Dr. Bryan K. Tippett. ( Dr. Tippett passed away in the S pring so his partner , Mr. Frank Wilson, received the award in his place .) Dr. Tippett has over 30 years of higher education experience, and was committed to ensu ring the highest quality teaching, learning, and caring for students, colleagues, and the community. Dr. Tippett began his career in Maricopa 17 years ago at Mesa Community College as an Associate Dean and then Senior Associate Dean, providing instructiona l leadership for the Division of Mathematics, Sciences, and Exercise Science. He served most recently as the Vice President of Academic Affairs at Estrella Mountain Community College. Dr. Tippett also held other leadership roles which included the Higher L earning Commission; Arizona Academic Administrators Association; Arizona State Board of Pharmacy; West Valley Fine Arts Council; Valley of the Sun United Way, and Sojourner Center, to name a few. Dr. Tippett was instrumental in establishing community partn erships and cross -functional MCCCD student activities, including: West Valley Think Tank which facilitates professional growth for instructors and P -20 pipeline for students across local school districts; the Student Research Conference, which uniquely pro vides MCCCD students with conference presentation opportunities for undergraduate research, an activity typically reserved for students at four -year institutions or in graduate -level coursework. His collaborative style supported faculty, staff, administrators, and students, empowering individuals to actualize their potential and advance their academic and life goals. He often stated: \"Many institutions of higher education are focused only on teaching, but Estrella Mountain Community College is focused on te aching, learning and caring; and to that end, every decision that is made should improve learning for all.\" Through the gift of caring and personal encouragement, Dr. Tippett gave heart to the Estrella family so that students and colleagues alike were able to pursue their dreams of higher education and success. Dr. Tippett exemplified teaching, learning and caring at Estrella Mountain Community College, within MCCCD, and for the community. Emeritus status for Dr. Bryan K. Tippett would memorialize his legac y and provide inspiration to family, friends, colleagues and students. Mr. Wilson thanked the Board on behalf of Dr. Tippett's family and himself for this moment. This emeritus award wonderfully finalizes Dr. Tippett's career and the implications are many. It represents a thank you for a job well done and validates his work. The world has lost another beautiful mind with his passing and today's gathering has allowed this honor to help his legacy move forward. From teaching to administration, he maintained a high bar for himself, yet he always kept in mind not everyone set the bar quite as high for themselves. Mr. Wilson said he lived with Dr. Tippett for 25 years and that ability made him what he was. He hopes his legacy will be carried on. Dr. Shari Olson , President of South Mountain Community College ( SMCC), introduced Ms. Barbara Gonzales, Adjunct Faculty and DECA advisor, to speak about the International Career Development Conference in which key individuals from the DECA club presented and placed. Ms. Gonzales said the students competed at Grand Canyon University in F ebruary and five students then went to the international conference in Orlando, FL. In order to go to the international conference, a student would have to score 70% and above for their first place win. Three SMCC students finished in the top 10. She then asked the students to come forward. Gus Barnes informed the Board he participated in the Entrepreneur Challenge which consisted of a case study (which he had 24 hours to study and prepare a presentation) and he finished in the top 10 out of 2,400. He said he received a Blue Diamond award for having 50 hours of community service and maintaining a 3.5 GPA. Brian Florendo informed the Board he participated in the Accounting Challenge which involved a simulation (which he had 30 minutes to study and prepare a p resentation) and finished in the top 10. Next year he plans to win! Juan Gonzales informed the Board he participated in the Human Resource Management Entrepreneurial Challenge (he also had only 30 minutes to read a case study and prepare a presentation). H e finished in the top 10, as well. He thanked the Board for funding the trip , saying he has learned to add value to himself. CITIZEN 'S INTERIM There were no requests to address the Board. CHANCELLOR REPORT Chancellor Rufus Glasper took a moment to reflect on Dr. Tippett. He said they shared a cinderblock wall for 19 years as neighbors and his death was a great loss to all. He then thanked the Board for approving the budget and for establishing its committees. MCCCD has never had a budget committee in 50 years and the current budget process has evolved over time. He advised the Board he understands the budget is a policy document and policy belongs to the Board. As MCCCD continues into the budget process for next year, he asks the Boa rd to consider the path the District has taken in the past 50 years. Since 2008, MCCCD has lost $68 million in resources Minutes | May 26, 2015 Regular Board Meeting Page 6 of 9 and has become more effective. MCCCD has cut its budgets by $48 million and will continue to do more. Last year, MCCCD had a $7.3 billi on impact on Maricopa County. He reminded the Board that 68% of the state university juniors have MCCCD credits . MCCCD is able to graduate students with a 4 -year degree in partnership with the state universities and students don't have to leave the college campus. MCCCD just awarded over 23,000 degrees. If it is not allowed to serve all of its communities, the Board needs to make those decisions very deliberately using evidence -based data. The data will show that, without some type of increase in the system , MCCCD cannot continue to serve all in the community. He has asked the Board to return to 60:40 ratio of full - time faculty to maintain a reasonable level of quality. He thanks the staff for being good soldiers during the trying times and many changes. The y get tired, however and he would hate to lose the best and the brightest because of the belief that it is more important to save money. He hopes the Board will continue to make decisions to allow MCCCD to continue to be the best institution in Arizona and the largest provider of workforce development.

It was great to see all t he grads who were excited to be at our colleges. Minutes | May 26, 2015 Regular Board Meeting Page 8 of 9 Mrs. Haver reported she recently visited SMCC and it was an exciting experience where she learned a lot. Their developmental education program is amazing. She was particularly impressed by their Boot Camp fo r students who 'almost' placed into college courses.

PCPA's capacity to Support Quality and long Term Academic Success in the following ways: 1)PCPA wrll continue to provide mentorship and support by dividing our bottom 35% into intervention teams led by teachers after school. 2)PCPA will continue to use \"Reading Plus\" intervention program that individualizes a reading plan for each student according to their ability level. Although many students come to us reading much lower than grade level, most of our students have improved two or three grade levels with this program. 3)PCPA will continue to require preliminary and post Galileo assessments on students in addition to 4 benchmark assessments and p,;z_ Merit testing each Spring. 4)PCPA requires all students to take the ACT prior to graduation and provides support and test taking strategies throughout the year including ACT Prep classes. 5)PCPA bridges the gap for students with Phoenix College main campus and requires them to take Accuplacerto help support their academic schedules with collegiate courses at the end of their 10th grade year. 6)PCPA will continue to add any and all necessary resources to ensure academic success for all of our students.

Teachers in charge of these colleges will not only help students with their high school and college plan, but also provide speakers, field trips, and internships related to these career fields. 8)PCPA will continue to pay for college classes for qualified students and help our students gain a head start to their college career. We had 160 students take 600 college classes during the 2017-2018 school year in comparison to 142 students that took 400 college classes in 2016-17 school year. During the 2017-2018 school year, 42% of our senior class were able to obtain their AA degree before even graduating from high school. Last school year, 2017-2018, we had students take an accumulation of 600 classes for 1,800 college credits. We are currently on track to sustain the same amount of college courses to be taken from our students for the 2018-2019 school year. Our goal is to have every student earn a minimum o f a year of college credits before graduation and 30% of our graduating classes earn their Associates degree from Phoenix College before graduating from Phoenix College Prep Academy each school year. We plan on sustaining the level of support for these college classes with the same level of student growth. We were able to secure grants to pay for large portions of these classes and grant managers have pledged their continuous support of our efforts. 9)PCPA has obtained an outside contract with Arizona Charter Association/Center for Student Achievement to provide onsite professional development for teachers and staff. This contract allows us 6 coaching sessions and in class observations. The contract offers guidance for Administration to uphold higher expectations of teachers, support staff and students. The contract shows and supports teachers for 6 week planning, lesson plans and data reviews. 10)PCPA has adopted and implemented AVID for incoming freshman since the 2018-19 academic year to help ensure the student's college readiness and academic achievements. 11)Since the 2017-2018 school year, we have provided test preparation resources for ACT and SAT testing. We utilize Chalk Talk Solutions to give test preparation for the ACTs and SATs. Since we implemented Chalk Talk Solutions, we have seen a 10% marked improvement in ACT test scores alone. We even had three students from the 2017-2018 school year, have a composite score of 32, 32 and 34. PCPA's capacity to Support Quality and Long Term Operational Success in the following ways: PCPA is located on the beautiful Osborn campus of Phoenix College. This location provides adequate space to grow to 374 students. 1)PCPA works with the Maintenance and Operations at Phoenix College to assure the grounds, classrooms, and facilities are maintained at a high level of appearance and safety standar ds. 2)PCPA has added 7 computer labs. This gave us 232 desktop computers, 65 laptop computers and 100 chrome- books ordered for the 2018-2019 academic year allowing us to have a 1 to 1 ratio. 3)PCPA has one Title I staff, and as of the 2018-2019 school year,our new ESS providers, Integrated Educational Services, will continue to help support the bottom 35% and address their academic needs. 4)PCPA has added 3 full time teachers for the 2018-19 school year and will continue to add teachers as our school continues to grow. PCPA will add 1 part time reading specialist that will assist the Title I staff and teachers to address Reading proficiency and standards for students on campus. PCPA will adjust Administrative and Office staff according to enrollment and need for additional support as enrollment increases each year. 5)PCPA will review the contract with Center for Student Achievemen t/ Arizona Charter Association in terms of Coachi ng and determine if a full time Data Coach versus part time contracted support is necessary as enrollment increases. 6)Our budget and finances are managed thro ugh the district office of the Maricopa Community Colleges. This ensures compliance to all policies and state laws as well as fiscally responsible decision-making. Maricopa Community Colleges budget is 1.6 billion annually. 7)PCPA and Phoenix College continue to co-host an annual STEAM weekend conference with Strong TIES providing exposure for our current students, surrounding Middle School and High School students interested in STEM and Art programs. This will also serve as a marketing/recruitment event for Middle School students potentially interested in PCPA. 8)For the past four years, we have provided a program called Reading Plus. Reading Plus has provided intervention to our lower level tier 1 students. PCPA's capacity to Support Quality and Long Term financial Viability in the following ways: 1)PCPA does not pay monthly rent because of the relationship to the charter holder considers our high school one of their own entities. This allows Phoenix College Prep Academy to be even more fiscally responsible and put extra money into our academic programs. 2)Due to our relationship with the Maricopa Community Colleges our students benefit in taking college classes free with proof of residenc y. 3)During the past 2 years, PCPA has had a waiting list for incoming freshman due to generally meeting the cap by June. We currently have 75 freshmen that have filled out the enrollment packets for the 2019-2020 school year. 4)We plan to have each freshmen class start with 75 over the next 3 years therefore increasing the numbers of upperclassmen each year. 5)PCPA continues to explore all opportunities to bring community awareness to the campus and program therefore generating more community partnerships and donati ons from partners and grants opportunities.

GOVERNING BOARD Tracy Livingston, President Johanna Haver, Secretary Doyle Burke, Member Alfredo Gutierrez, Member John Heep, Member Jane McGrath, Member Dana Saar, Member ADMINISTRATION Rufus Glasper Maria Harper -Marinick Debra Thompson LaCoya Shelton Steve Helfgot Combs Linda Steven Gonzales Janet Langley for Irene Kovala Shouan Pan Paul Dale Paul DeRose for Chris Haines Chris Bustamante Jan Gehler Shari Olson Gene Giovannini CALL TO ORDER The public hearings were called to order at 6:31 p.m. PUBLIC HEARINGS The Maricopa County Community College District presented its proposed FY2015 -16 budget ($1.4 billion) for adoption. There was no proposal to increase tuition or property tax levy. President Livingston provided the opportunity to address the Governing Board concerning the proposed budget. One citizen and tax payer asked to present. Reverend Dr. Robin Hollis, from Valley Interfaith Project (VIP), mentioned she was a deacon of the Ariz ona Episcopal Diocese and said she wanted to recognize MCCCD and the role it plays in Arizona. She appreciates that role and she wanted to thank the administration for ensuring that Maricopa's families have a place to get a higher education and workforce d evelopment. She asked the Board to consider a few facts as it pondered its budget decision: MCCCD is the most affordable higher education opportunity for the community especially in light of the fact that approximately 68% of jobs will require post -seconda ry education by 2020. MCCCD also remains the largest provider of job training. With the State 's decision to winnow its support down to zero it sends the wrong message to the community. She hopes the State recovers its senses and re -engages support for high er education. There can be no greater investment in human capital than higher education. She applaud s the Board's courage and gives it thanks. The Maricopa County Community College District then considered the proposed budgets for GateWay Early College Hig h School (GWECHS) and Phoenix College Preparatory Academy (PCPA) for FY2015- 16. President Livingston asked the Vice Chancellor of Business Services, Ms. Debra Thompson, to present the budgets under consideration. Ms. Thompson asked the principal of GWECHS , Ms. Lisa Smith, to provide additional information. Ms. Smith reported that enrollment was expected to increase from 267 to 27 3. Average daily membership is expected to increase slightly from 262 to 265. State based funding per student increased slightly from $3,373.11 to $3,426.74. The State will provide $2,022.02 in additional funding (including an inflation rate of 1.59%) . The allocation of Prop 301 funds per student remains the same at $295 . All instructional programs and staffing remain unchanged and additional funding is earmarked for instructional materials and increased cost s of fundamental items (i.e., bus passes, paper, etc.) Minutes | May 26, 2015 Regular Board Meeting Page 2 of 9 Ms. Thompson then asked the principal of PCPA, Mr. Keith Brown, to provide additional information. Mr. Brown reported that enrollment was expected to increase from 90 to 120 (the maximum number of students the school can have is 100 although the Board is considering his request to increase the cap to 400 ). Average daily membership is expected to remain static . State based fun ding per student increased slightly from $3,373.11 to $3,426.74 . The State will provide $2,022.02 in additional funding . Prop 301 funds per student remain at $295. PCPA's budget is increasing in a few budget areas due to enrollment increases. The transport ation budget for 2015 -16 has increased due to more students. PCPA is hoping to add breakfast to its lunch program at no additional costs this year. President Livingston then provided an opportunity to address the Governing Board concerning the proposed cha rter school budgets. No citizens asked to present. President Livingston concluded the public hearings to adopt the proposed budget for FY2015 - 16 and to approve the proposed budgets for the two charter schools. Copies of the budget presentations are in the appendix. The Public Hearings were concluded at 6:50 p.m. SPECIAL SESSION President Livingston convened a Special Session immediately following the public hearings. ITEM 1.1 ADOPTION OF PROPOSED MARICOPA COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLE GE DISTRICT BUDGET FY2015- 16\u2014adopt proposed FY 2015 -16 Budget. The General Fund, Current Auxiliary Fund, Current Restricted Fund, and Plant Fund total $1.5 billion. Pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes, the proposed Legal Budget has been made available online on the District's main w eb page and was published in Arizona Republic on May 11th and May 18th. Some Board members asked to provide background on their decision : Mr. Burke: He asked the Board to consider strongly entertaining the notion to increase property tax levy and tuition next year. Mr. Gutierrez: He feels this budget reflects 'planned obsolescence' and if MCCCD goes into the future with a flat budget, many things will begin to take a toll on the district (e.g., inflation, demoralization of employees, and 'magically maintai ned' buildings). The Board has to consider the consequences. The costs are known (maintenance, not increasing salaries/COLA) so MCCCD knows what to expect. He votes 'aye' with great hesitation and hopes this Board realizes if this continues MCCCD may becom e a second -rate institution. Mr. Heep: He thanked the administration and Board for reviewing the budget process and the continuous plans to free up capital for continued growth in the district. Mrs. McGrath: She remarked this was the third budget she has p articipated in development of and the only one which was completed by someone else and presented to the Board and explained by staff. She cannot vote yes for something she had not role in. Mrs. Livingston: She thanked everyone who worked on the budget and said she was proud of it. She disagrees that it is planned obsolescence, rather it is time to think way outside the box \u2014time to get a little dirty and plan for what is next. MOTION Motion 10299 Board Member Saar made a motion to adopt Item 1. 1. Board Memb er Haver seconded. In accordance with state law, the Governing Board voted on this motion by roll call: Mr. Burke \u2014aye; Mr. Gutierrez Saar \u2014aye. By a vote of 6-1 (McGrath), the motion passed.

STUDENT LIFE REPORTS Rio Salado College (RSC) Student Life and Leadership (SLL) members approached the podium and reported on activities at the college. The purpose of SLL is to engage students in activities and organizations outside of their academics. Rio Salado may not offer traditional \"campus\" life, but it does provide many ways for students to get involved and add value to their academic experience. Students can be online and engaged by participating in the National Society of Leadership and Success (NSLS), Phi Theta Kappa International Honor Society (PTK), Student Public Policy Forum (SPPF), Be a Leader Foundation Mentorship Program, Chancellor's Civ ic Leadership Medallion, or Student Leadership Retreat. Students shared the National Society of Leadership and Success induction requirements ( orientation, leadership training day, three reflections on s peaker broadcasts, and t hree success networking team meetings) and what is required to be considered for a National Engaged Leader Award ( six reflections on s peaker broadcasts, six success networking team meetings, and f ive hours of c ommunity service). This is the second year of Rio's chapter. About 120 stud ents joined and 35 students were honored as inducted members. In total, 13 students received the National Engaged Leader Award. Students then went on to describe Rio's Phi Theta Kappa International Honor Society requirements: c umulative GPA 3.50+, 12 credi ts completed, currently enrolled at RSC, Phi Theta Kappa a pplication, and a m embership fee. Rio's PTK International Honor Society is a Five Star Chapter of the l argest honor society in h igher education and provides commencement student speaker candidates and c ommencement student marshal candidates. It hosted the PTK Honors' Institute for the Arizona Region and the Honors -In-Action Project with the City of Tempe Public Library focused on draw ing females into STEM fields.

He then introduced Ms. Christie Colunga, Early Childhood Education faculty at PVCC, to speak. Ms. Colunga informed the Board that the AAS degree in Early Childhood Education offered by PVCC is accredited by the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). An explosion of research highlights the importance of early life experiences and the central role of early relationships ( From Neurons to Neighborhoods: the Science of Early Childhood Development , 2000). PVCC responded to several grant opportunities in 2010- 2015 including: Early Childhood Teacher Professional Development in Language Acquisition and Literacy, a Helios Education Foundation grant, which sought to update and unify Arizona's approach to language acquisition and early literacy by establishing foundational, standard college course work.

He then introduced the student speakers: Mallory Kurtz, Richard Anson, and Laurel Smith to present . The students reported on MUNFW saying it is one of the original five Model United Nations conferences commissioned by the United Nations; Eleanor Roosevelt was the second keynote speaker; and past hosts include Stanford, San Francisco State University, Mesa Community College, UC Berkeley, and Arizona State University. The theme was The Reach of the UN in the Modern Era: The Conflict Between Individual, Collective, and Sovereign Rights . Committees simulated included GA, UNESCO, IMO, UNHCR, UNHRC, Security Council, and Sixth Committee. The students reported that they were the first school to bring up LGBTQ topics \u2014 which is now gaining momentum. Their Career Fair included the Peace Corps, Department of State, Hunger Watch, and the U.S. Army. They launched a social media aspect for the fair and received good feedback from the State Department about it. Dr. Chris Bustamante, President of Rio Salado College (RSC), introduced Mr. Otis White, Faculty Chair for Business and Public Administration at Rio, who presented on the great partnership between MCCCD and industry partners (insurance). At the Insurance Industry Summit - April 2014, he learned that there are 7,000+ employment positions curren tly available in Maricopa County and in the next five to seven years this number will increase to 15,000. Insurance is a dominant industry growth sector in Arizona and nationwide and offers high paying jobs with a broad range of career options within the i ndustry. MCCCD works with an advisory committee comprised of 46 members and represent 23+ national and local companies and organizations. Committee members come from RSC, MCC, GCC, NAU, and the National Industry Education Organizations.

FACULTY EXECUTIVE COUNCIL (FEC) REPORT Ms. Salina Bednarak , President of the Faculty Association (FA), reported she was the new President and said she was proud to work for Maricopa and the students it serves. She said residential faculty members dedicate thei r lives to students and FA supports efforts that are transformative for students and meaningful for faculty. They also work with the Adjunct Faculty Association (AFA) and understand that, while the system relies heavily on adjuncts, FA wholeheartedly agrees that increasing the n umber of residential faculty is necessary. She promised to work together with the Board to meet the needs of the institution. ADJUNCT FACULTY ASSOCIATION (AFA) REPORT Mr. Leo Valverde, President of the Adjunct Faculty Association (AFA) , reported two items .

Minutes | May 26, 2015 Regular Board Meeting Page 5 of 9 EMERITUS , AWARDS , AND RECOGNITION Dr. Ernie Lara , President of Estrella Mountain Community College ( EMCC), thanked the Board and asked EMCC's Dean of Academic Affairs, Ms. Kathleen Iudicello, to help present a Vice President Emeritus Distinction to Dr. Bryan K. Tippett. ( Dr. Tippett passed away in the S pring so his partner , Mr. Frank Wilson, received the award in his place .) Dr. Tippett has over 30 years of higher education experience, and was committed to ensu ring the highest quality teaching, learning, and caring for students, colleagues, and the community. Dr. Tippett began his career in Maricopa 17 years ago at Mesa Community College as an Associate Dean and then Senior Associate Dean, providing instructiona l leadership for the Division of Mathematics, Sciences, and Exercise Science. He served most recently as the Vice President of Academic Affairs at Estrella Mountain Community College. Dr. Tippett also held other leadership roles which included the Higher L earning Commission; Arizona Academic Administrators Association; Arizona State Board of Pharmacy; West Valley Fine Arts Council; Valley of the Sun United Way, and Sojourner Center, to name a few. Dr. Tippett was instrumental in establishing community partn erships and cross -functional MCCCD student activities, including: West Valley Think Tank which facilitates professional growth for instructors and P -20 pipeline for students across local school districts; the Student Research Conference, which uniquely pro vides MCCCD students with conference presentation opportunities for undergraduate research, an activity typically reserved for students at four -year institutions or in graduate -level coursework. His collaborative style supported faculty, staff, administrators, and students, empowering individuals to actualize their potential and advance their academic and life goals. He often stated: \"Many institutions of higher education are focused only on teaching, but Estrella Mountain Community College is focused on te aching, learning and caring; and to that end, every decision that is made should improve learning for all.\" Through the gift of caring and personal encouragement, Dr. Tippett gave heart to the Estrella family so that students and colleagues alike were able to pursue their dreams of higher education and success. Dr. Tippett exemplified teaching, learning and caring at Estrella Mountain Community College, within MCCCD, and for the community. Emeritus status for Dr. Bryan K. Tippett would memorialize his legac y and provide inspiration to family, friends, colleagues and students. Mr. Wilson thanked the Board on behalf of Dr. Tippett's family and himself for this moment. This emeritus award wonderfully finalizes Dr. Tippett's career and the implications are many. It represents a thank you for a job well done and validates his work. The world has lost another beautiful mind with his passing and today's gathering has allowed this honor to help his legacy move forward. From teaching to administration, he maintained a high bar for himself, yet he always kept in mind not everyone set the bar quite as high for themselves. Mr. Wilson said he lived with Dr. Tippett for 25 years and that ability made him what he was. He hopes his legacy will be carried on. Dr. Shari Olson , President of South Mountain Community College ( SMCC), introduced Ms. Barbara Gonzales, Adjunct Faculty and DECA advisor, to speak about the International Career Development Conference in which key individuals from the DECA club presented and placed. Ms. Gonzales said the students competed at Grand Canyon University in F ebruary and five students then went to the international conference in Orlando, FL. In order to go to the international conference, a student would have to score 70% and above for their first place win. Three SMCC students finished in the top 10. She then asked the students to come forward. Gus Barnes informed the Board he participated in the Entrepreneur Challenge which consisted of a case study (which he had 24 hours to study and prepare a presentation) and he finished in the top 10 out of 2,400. He said he received a Blue Diamond award for having 50 hours of community service and maintaining a 3.5 GPA. Brian Florendo informed the Board he participated in the Accounting Challenge which involved a simulation (which he had 30 minutes to study and prepare a p resentation) and finished in the top 10. Next year he plans to win! Juan Gonzales informed the Board he participated in the Human Resource Management Entrepreneurial Challenge (he also had only 30 minutes to read a case study and prepare a presentation). H e finished in the top 10, as well. He thanked the Board for funding the trip , saying he has learned to add value to himself. CITIZEN 'S INTERIM There were no requests to address the Board. CHANCELLOR REPORT Chancellor Rufus Glasper took a moment to reflect on Dr. Tippett. He said they shared a cinderblock wall for 19 years as neighbors and his death was a great loss to all. He then thanked the Board for approving the budget and for establishing its committees. MCCCD has never had a budget committee in 50 years and the current budget process has evolved over time. He advised the Board he understands the budget is a policy document and policy belongs to the Board. As MCCCD continues into the budget process for next year, he asks the Boa rd to consider the path the District has taken in the past 50 years. Since 2008, MCCCD has lost $68 million in resources Minutes | May 26, 2015 Regular Board Meeting Page 6 of 9 and has become more effective. MCCCD has cut its budgets by $48 million and will continue to do more. Last year, MCCCD had a $7.3 billi on impact on Maricopa County. He reminded the Board that 68% of the state university juniors have MCCCD credits . MCCCD is able to graduate students with a 4 -year degree in partnership with the state universities and students don't have to leave the college campus. MCCCD just awarded over 23,000 degrees. If it is not allowed to serve all of its communities, the Board needs to make those decisions very deliberately using evidence -based data. The data will show that, without some type of increase in the system , MCCCD cannot continue to serve all in the community. He has asked the Board to return to 60:40 ratio of full - time faculty to maintain a reasonable level of quality. He thanks the staff for being good soldiers during the trying times and many changes. The y get tired, however and he would hate to lose the best and the brightest because of the belief that it is more important to save money. He hopes the Board will continue to make decisions to allow MCCCD to continue to be the best institution in Arizona and the largest provider of workforce development.

It was great to see all t he grads who were excited to be at our colleges. Minutes | May 26, 2015 Regular Board Meeting Page 8 of 9 Mrs. Haver reported she recently visited SMCC and it was an exciting experience where she learned a lot. Their developmental education program is amazing. She was particularly impressed by their Boot Camp fo r students who 'almost' placed into college courses. The Boot Camp provides intense instruction over a couple of weeks, saving students a semester's worth of time and expense . She also attended several celebrations including one for SPOT 107. She also atte nded CGCC's Silver and Teal Awards. She attended the Maricopa Foundation Awards program and participated in PC's Commencement. She said half of the students received their degrees in the rain but no one left until everyone had gotten their papers. Mr. Heep congratulated students for their graduations and gave a shout out to the presidents and their staff for their enthusiasm. He said it was an honor to participate. He attended Commencements for Rio and MCC and also the Veteran's Convocation. He also went to CGCC's Silver and Teal Awards and was impressed as he has never seen that kind of appreciation for vendors before. Mrs. McGrath reported she also attended many rewarding ceremonies. Mr. Saar reported he attended SCC Commencement and noted that MCCCD gradu ated over 25,000 students this year. He congratulated everyone.

Mrs. Livingston reported she had spoken at Rio, GWCC, PVCC Commencements and at the Veterans Convocation, and was delighted to speak at Rio's High School Equivalency graduation. Several of those students came back to us after some time away and it was absolutely moving. It was so exciting to be there and to feel their excitement and see in their eyes and heart. They were all true champions that night. It was a pleasure to see all the different graduates make their mark . So many were off the traditi onal path, including many dual enrollment students who received their college degree before graduating from high school. She was so pleased to see what MCCCD is turning out. She reported she had gone to visit SMCC before the Board meeting that day and was similarly impressed with their developmental education efforts. She will be finishing her college tours in August. VICE CHANCELLOR There were no reports. AADGB There was no report. ASBA AND ACCT There were no reports.

(\"Charter Holder\") submitted an expansion amendment request to add a new school to the existing charter contract, increase the grade levels the Charter Holder is approved to serve from grades K -8 to grades K-12, and to increase the enrollment cap from 900 to 1800, beginning in FY 20 21. This enrollment cap accounts for three years of projected student enrollment. See Appendix A: Amendment Request Materials and Support Materials . The Charter Holder is making this request in order to extend its whole -child model of education to students in Kindergarten through 12th grade . According to the Charter Holder's narrative, \"w hen combining the growth trajectory of Paideia, the lack of quality high school options in South P hoenix, along with the demand for the Paideia high school program, it is imperative now to complete the expansion process through high school graduation along with a new campus to house 7th - 12th grades .\" The staffing plan includes utilizing internal candidates to take on the role of principal at the current and proposed schools, and having the current principal transition exclusively to the role of Executive D irector. Recruitment will be done through \"digital advertising, the Paideia substitute cohort, and in -state universities.\" Teacher training will be conducted through Paideia's online training portal and also include coaching from teacher coaches and grade -level/content area team leaders. The 9 - 12 curriculum will include \"rigorous fiction and nonfiction text, meaningful partner discussion, in -depth Socratic seminars, and purposeful coached projects across the disciplines.\" Three Year Plan FY 2019 FY 202 0 Enrollment 842 900 1235 1375 Staff Recommendation The Charter Hol der has not met the criteria to receive a staff recommendation for expansion.

Freshman Project : Freshman students are required to complete the My Voice ECAP planning form. This project will guide the student to discover talents, interests, learning style and passions in planning their high school journey. They will be introduced to the four \"Find My Voice\" questions: o What need do you sense in your family, community and the world? o Do you possess a true talent that, if nurtured through learning, can meet the need? o Does the opportunity to meet the need tap into your passion ? o Does your conscience inspire you to take action and become involved? Students in their freshman year will focus on the first question: \"What need do I sense in my family, community, world?\" The culminating project will identify a range of needs that interest the student along with why that need is important to solve and pos sible solutions. Sophomore Project: The sophomore project continues developing the freshman project by focusing on the second question, \"What true talent do I have that if nurtured through learning can meet the need identified in the freshman project?\" Th e culminating project will include the student's exploration of learning styles and what is needed to learn and where to go to gain the knowledge to make an impact on the need identified in the Freshman project. Junior Project: The junior project builds on the previous years of development by exploring the question, \"Does the opportunity to meet the need tap into my passion to act?\" The student more deeply explores social impacts and ramifications of inaction to the need identified. The culminating project is an outline of action to be accomplished in the senior project. Senior Project: The senior project culminates with targeted internships and action research within the area of need, learning and passion identified in the previous years. Meditations Journ al: All Paideia students are exposed daily from Kindergarten to graduation to ideas that provoke critical thinking and deep pondering. These ideas might be sparked through thought -provoking quotes, short stories, pictures or music. Students spend one full week on a single idea. Every morning all Paideia students reflect or meditate on the presented idea. These reflections or meditations are recorded in their personal Meditations Journal. This daily habit develops the skill of thinking deeply and pondering s lowly of ideas and principles. During the student's senior year, she will explore through previous meditations and create a final meditations journal representing her intellectual journey to graduation. The meditations journal will be published by the sch ool with one copy given to the scholar at graduation and one copy placed in the Paideia library.

This way, as he understands it, the two Paideia schools would not impact one another in their annual academic grade from the state.

Activating Prior Knowledge: discussion and questioning of previous learning about the standard 9 -10.W.1.a Word Work: Word Work could include context analysis, questioning, discussion of word use, and application to the standard. Academic Vocabulary for Word Work: central claim, oppos ing claim, counterclaim, reasoning , evidence Research -Pair-Share: Students have done previous research in preparation for the research -based argument paper. Have students discuss in pairs the strongest or most interesting possible central claim that has emerged from their research. Guided Practice using Outline Tool: Distribute the Outline Tool. Guide students to record their problem -based questions on the tool. Didactic Instruction and Questioning : Provide didactic instruction on central claims. Display a series of claims for students to analyze: o Central Claim: Granting anyone the rights to sell human tissue is morally and ethically questionable; neither researchers nor patients should have rights to s ell any human tissue. o Claim: Giving researchers legal ownership of others' genes, cells, or tissues infringes on individuals' rights to privacy and control over their unique genetic information. o Claim: Doctors and researchers can profit from tissue taken d uring surgery and institutions have control over these tissue samples. Word Work: Students will analyze and discuss the academic language for the standard - central claim, opposing claim, counterclaim, reasoning, evidence Research -Pair-Share: Students will discuss in pairs the strongest or most interesting possible central claim that ha s emerged from their research. Outline Tool : Record problem -based questions on the Outline Tool Discuss Central Claims: o Include subtopics that develop the topic and support the claim o Clearly state each subtopic o Use relevant and sufficient e vidence to develop my subtopics o Adapt content and l anguage to my specific audience Analyze claims : Students will organize the claims they identified in a coherent order. Partner Work: Discuss ideas and fill in Evidence and Reasoning portions of the Outline Tool. The student activities are aligned to the standard 9-10.W.1.a because students are introducing precise claims and creating a clear organization. 3 o Claim: The sale or resale of human tissue is dehumanizing and exacts a psychological toll on the patient or the patient's family. Ask: Which claim in this sequence does not support the central claim? Guided Practice and Intellectual Coaching : Instruct students to organize the claims they identified in a coherent order. Ask potential questions for students to guide their organization of the tools: o Are your Evidence -Based Claims in a logi cal order? o How do you link your claims to best support the central claims? o How can you transition from one claim to another to effectively show the reasoning and how it best supports the central claim? Model the Outline Tool : Remind students that the pu rpose of this outline is to have a clear plan for their research -based argument paper and to consolidate all of their information. Display one supporting claim of the Model Outline Tool for students. Explain that students need to use the evidence from thei r research to support each claim in the body of their paper (much like each claim in the paper supports the central claim), and copy the evidence onto the \"Evidence\" portion of the Outline Tool. Explain that students will write a brief explanation of how t his evidence supports each claim in the \"Reasoning\" portion of the Outline Tool. Model the process. Inform students that this analysis is the starting point for each body paragraph and the foundation of the reasoning among the evidence in the research -based argument paper. Partner Discussion : Instruct students to form pairs to discuss their ideas about which evidence best supports the first claim on their Outline Tool. Then students complete the first \"Evidence\" and \"Reasoning\" portions of the Outline Tool. 2 9-10.W.1 .b Objective : In this instructional strategy, the teacher will review the objective for this lesson - Students will determine a central claim for an argument, organize supporting claims and evidence for each claim, and analyze the evidence that supports each claim. Activating Prior Knowledge: discussion and questioning of previous learnin g about the standard 9 -10.W.1.b Word Work: Word Work could include context analysis, questioning, discussion of word use, and application to the standard. Academic Vocabulary for Word W ork: counterclaim, refute, opposing claim , supporting claim Developing Counterclaims: Students will develop counterclaims to their central claims and supporting claims for the counterclaim Turn and Talk: Students will talk to a partner about the relationships between the claim and the counterclaim: What is the view of the counterclaim How is it refuting the central claim? Discuss: Discus s counterclaims and supporting claims with the whole class. Partner Work: Students form pairs to review their central claims on the Outline Tool and form a counterclaim to their central claim. 4 Developing Counterclaims: Direct students to the counterclaims portion of the Outline Tool. Explain to students that in this lesson, they will develop both counterclaims to their central claims and supporting claims for the counterclaim. Turn and Talk: Display the model central cl aim and counterclaim portions of the Model Outline Tool. Ask students to briefly Turn -and-Talk in pairs to discuss the following question about the relationship between the claim and counterclaim. What is the view of the counterclaim? How is it refuting th e central claim? Discussion: Lead a brief whole -class discussion on student responses. Partner Review : Instruct students to form pairs to review their central claims on the Outline Tool and form a counterclaim to their central claim. Remind students to ref er to their Research Portfolios if necessary because over the course of their research, they have encountered opposing perspectives concerning their issues. Remind students that if they have several counterclaims to consider, they should think about which counterclaim would provide a more interesting or compelling exploration of the topic. Didactic Instruction on supporting claims: Display the following supporting claims for students. Model Counterclaim: All tissue should be available for an individual to sell if it does not endanger the individual's life and would improve his or her financial situation. Claim: If an individual has a way to profit from their body, they can put themselves in a position to make a lot of money. Claim: Compensation is necessary to get tissue donations. Claim: Researchers should not be the only ones profiting from sale of human tissue. Ask student pairs to discuss the following question: Which of the claims best supports the counterclaim and why? Which supporting claim does not e ffectively support the counterclaim and why? Outline Tool : Explain to students the Outline Tool is the lesson assessment. They will be assessed on the counterclaim as well as the supporting claims, evidence, and reasoning for the counterclaim. Instruct students to record the supporting claims for the counterclaim on the \"Supporting Claim\" portion of the Outline Tool, the evidence on the \"Evidence\" portion of the Outline Tool, and the reasoning on the \"Reasoning\" portion of the Outline Tool. Discuss in partners: Which of the claims best supports the co unterclaim and why? Which supporting claim does not effectively support the counterclaim and why? Outline Tool: Record the supporting claims for the counterclaim on the \"Supporting Claim\" portion of the Outline Tool, the evidence on the \"Evidence\" porti on of the Outline Tool, and the reasoning on the \"Reasoning\" portion of the Outline Tool. The student activities are aligned to the standard 9 -10.W.1.a because students are introducing and developing counterclaims. 5 Evidence -Based Claims Criteria Checklist (for use during instruction/modeling) S.A.

Activating Prior Knowledge: Students should begin to factor polynomial expressions by first analyzing their structure, a skill that is developed throughout the lesson. Suggest that students work on their own and then compare answers with a neighbor; allow students extra time if necessary. (A2.MP.7 ) Students should notice that the structure of each of the factored polynomials is the same; for example, the factored forms of part (a) and part (b) are nearly the same, except that part (b) contains 3 in place of the in part (a). In parts (c) and (d) , the factored form of part (d) contains 2, where there is only an in part (c). The factored form of part (f) is nearly the same as the factored form of part (e), with 2 replacing and 2 replacing . The difference of two squares formula, 22=(+)(), can be used to factor an expression even when the two squares are not obvious. Consider the following examples. Example 1 Write as the product of two factors. =()()=()(+) Example 2 Factor . - Engage in anticipatory set and discuss prior knowledge - Work in groups to factor polynomial equations in one variable and participate in a class discussion by using vocabulary and terms relevant to the lesson - Work out exit ticket problems with the goal of self -assessing their own process in factoring polynomial equations in one variable Activities are aligned to the standard A2.A -SSE.A.2 because students are polynomial expressions and factoring patterns. Rev. 08/08/16 For Use in Amendment Requests only Page 3 of 7 = ()() =(+)() = [(+)][()] =(+)() Have students discuss with each other the structure of each polynomial expression in the previous two examples and how it helps to factor the expressions. Example 3 Consider the quadratic polynomial expression 92+125. We can factor this expression by considering 3 as a single quantity as follows: 92+125= (3)2+4(3)5. Ask students to suggest the next step in factoring this expression. Now, if we rename =3, we have a quadratic expression of the form 2+ 45, which we can factor 2+45=(1)(+5). Replacing by 3, we have the following for m of our original expression: 92+125=(31)(35). 2 Objective: Students use the structure of polynomials to identify factors. Activating Prior Knowledge (A2.MP.7) Direct Instruction/Intellectual Coaching: Use the example of factoring 38 to scaffold the discussion of factoring 38. Students should be pretty familiar by now with factors of 38. Let them try the problem on their own to check their understanding. Suppose we want to factor 38. Do you see anything interesting about this expression? (A2.MP.7) If they do not notice it, guide them toward both terms being perfect cubes. We can rewrite 38 as 3-23. - Engage in anticipatory set and discuss prior knowledge - Work in groups to factor polynomial equations in one variable and participate in a class discussion by using vocabulary and terms relevant to the lesson - Work out exit ticket problems with the goal of self -assessing their own process in factoring polynomial equations in one variable Activities are aligned to the standard A2.A -SSE.A.2 bec ause students are polynomial expressions and factoring patterns. Rev. 08/08/16 For Use in Amendment Requests only Page 4 of 7 Guess a factor. Anticipate that they will suggest 2 and +2 as poss ible factors, or guide them to these suggestions. Guided Instruction on Rewriting Rational Expressions: 1) 4x+8 4 2) 44 2+4+4 Small Group Work: Group students to work together on Exercise 2 -4. Have students put problems up on whiteboards for class to discuss. Closing Ask students to summarize the important parts of the lesson in writing, to a partner, or as a class. Use this as an opportunity t o informally assess understanding of the lesson. The following are some important summary elements. Exit ticket as student self -assessment: Students take their exit ticket independently. Teachers write solutions to exit ticket problems on board and have students assess their own work and conclusions. 1.

Rev. 08/08/16 For Use in Amendment Requests only Page 7 of 8 Model Rhetorical Impact Tracking Tool Name: Class: Date: Text: \"Of Our Spiritual Strivings\" from of Black Folk by W.E.B. Du Bois 11-12.RI.6: Determine an author's point of view or purpose in a text in which the rhetoric is particularly effective, analyzing how style and content contribute to the power, persuasiveness, or beauty of the text. 11-12.W.9b Draw evidence from literary or information al texts to support anal ysis, reflection, and research. b. Apply grades 11 -12 Reading standards to informational text and nonfiction. Rhetoric: The specific techniques that writers or speakers use to create meaning in a text, enhance a text or a speech, and in particul ar, persuade readers or listeners. Point of View (an author's opinion, attitude, or judgment) : Purpose (an author's reason for wri ting) : Rhetorical device and definition Examples of the rhetorical device in the text (with paragraph or page reference) Rhetorical effect (power, persuasiveness, beauty, point of view, purpose) Parallel structure: using the same pattern of words to show that two or more ideas are equally important \"to be a co -worker in the kingdom of culture, to escape both death and isolation, to husband and use his best powers and his latent genius.\" (par. 5) Du Bois's use of parallel structure contributes to the p ower of his text because it emphasizes the idea that African Americans want to achieve equality, and that achieving it will help them escape \"death and isolation,\" and allow them to use their \"best and genius\" (par. 5). Allusion: an indire reference \"The shadow of a mighty Negro past flits through the tale of Ethiopia the Shadowy and of Egypt the Sphinx.\" (par. 5) These allusions contribute to the power of the text because they remind the reader of the strong and celebrated history of African Americans that has been largely forgotten or ignored. Imagery: the use of figurative language or vivid descriptions to make pictures in the reader's mind \"the powers of single black men flash here and there like falling stars\" (par. 5) Du Bois's d escription of black men as falling stars contributes to the beauty of the text because it compares African -American men to rare and extraordinary celestial elements that occur only briefly before they disappear forever. This emphasizes the tragedy of how t he important contributions of \"single black men\" (par. 5) have been overlooked.

Rev. 08/08/16 For Use in Amendment Requests only Page 6 of 8 Summative Assessment High Performance Response Requirements Item #1 Analyze the effectiveness of the structure Silko uses in her exposition, including whether the structure makes points clear, convincing, and engaging. Student responses will be assessed using the 12.1.2 End -of-Unit Text Analysis Rubric. High Performance Response(s) A High Performance Response should: Identify 3 -5 structural elements of \"Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit\" (e.g., The essay is written in first person, and is reflec tive. The essay relies heavily on memory and flashbacks, and continually contrasts \"old -time\" stories and people with d ominant contemporary American values. Silko does not directly address the title of her essay until the final paragraphs, which creates a circular structure.). A High Performance Response may include the following evidence in support of a multi -paragraph analysis: The essay is written in the first person and uses flashbacks to relate personal experiences (e.g., \"One day, when I was in th e first grade, we all crowded around the smiling white tourists\" (par. 8)). Silko's use of first person and flashbacks i s engaging because it feels as if Silko is speaking directly to the reader, engaging with her past in an inviting way. Silko titles her essay \"Yellow Woman and a Beauty of the Spirit,\" but does not reference \"Yellow Woman,\" or Kochininako, unti l the final paragraphs of her essay, creating a circular structure. Silko begins focusing on herself with the statement \"From the time I was a small child, I was aware that I was different\" (par. 1). She recalls how her racial differences made her stand out, but how the \"old -time people\" never saw her as worth less than anyone else (par. 3). She then recounts several \"old stories,\" some of them personal and some of them mythical, ending finally with stories about \"Yellow Woman.\" She clarifies for the reader that in these stories, beauty is seen as an inward manifestation more so than an outward one: \"remember that the old -time people were not so much thinking about physical appearances. In each story, the beauty that Yellow Woman possesses is the beauty of her passion, her daring, and her sheer strength to act when catastrophe is immin ent\" (par. 26). After describing Yellow Woman, Silko writes that she \"even imagined that Yellow Woman had yellow skin, brown hair , and green eyes like mine\" (par. 30). Here, she conflates Yellow Woman's beauty and her own, giving the title of the essay more than one meaning. \"Yellow Woman\" refers both to Kochininako and Silko herself, and the \"beauty of the spirit\" belongs to both of them \u2014indeed, to \"all women\" (par. 32). The circular structure makes her claims about inner beauty more clear because the reader can trace the idea consistently through all the stories of the text. The circular structure also makes Silko's claims about beauty more engaging because the stories of beauty vary from personal family experiences to interesting mythical stories, ultimately including all women in the defini tion of beauty. Silko relies heavily on reflection, often referencing her Grandma A'moo h, and the \"old -time people.\" Like memory, her account is very fluid, often moving onto a new story or claim by simple association. However, at times, Silko's memory shifts are jarring in their juxtaposition. For exampl e, she discusses \"Tse'itsi'nako\" and then abruptly shifts to discussing the appearance of her great -grandmother (par. 10 -11). Also, when she is recounting stories of Yellow Woman, she inserts a jarring memory: At first Silko writes, \"Thus Kochininako's fearless sensuality results in the sa lvation of the people of her village, who are saved by the meat the Buffalo People 'give' to them\" (par. 27). Silko then immediately follows this story with the following sentences: \"My father taught me and my sisters to shoot .22 rifles when we were seve n; I went hunting with my father when I was eight, and I killed my first mule deer buck when I was thirteen. The Kochininako stori es were always my favorite because Yellow Woman had so many adventures\" (par. 28). This memory is relevant, but Silko makes no effort to transition in or out of it; it simply appears. Silko uses juxtaposition to imitate how memory works in people's minds \u2014seemingly unconnected scenes appear one after the other. This structural choice engages the reader because it feels as if the reader is invited into Silko's memory. The juxtaposition of stories also engages the reader becaus e it is jarring, and the reader must make sense of how the two st ories fit together. Summative Assessment High Performance Response Requirements Summative Assessment High Performance Response Requirements Rev. 08/08/16 For Use in Amendment Requests only Page 7 of 8 Item #2 Item #3 Assessment(s) Analyze the effectiveness of the way Silko begins the text. Student responses will be assessed using the 12.1.2 End -of-Unit Text Analysis Rubric. High Performance Response(s) A High Performance Response should: Describe an aspect of the way Silko begins the text (e.g., In her first sentence, Silko observes that \"[f]rom the time [she] was a small child, [she] was aware that [she] was different\" (par. 1).). Explain whether or not and why the way Silko begins the text is effective (e.g., Because this observation indicates that Silko has struggled with this awareness of difference \"[f]rom the time [she] was a small child\" (par. 1), th e reader instantly understands its importance to Silko. By setting out such a personal and significant observation in the very first sentence, Silko immediately engages the reader by making him or her curious about why Silko \"was different\" (par. 1) and ho w she has experienced it over the course of her life. Directly following the observation of her difference, Silko reaches further back in time before her childhood and explains that her great -grandfather was white and \"married [a] full -blood Laguna Pueblo wom[a]n\" (par. 1). Through sharing her family history, Silko clarifies why she and her sisters \"didn't look quite like the other Laguna Pueblo children, but [they] didn't look quite white either\" (par. 1). Including this information helps clarify why Silko 's appearance as both white and Indian is a significant issue for Silko to discuss. Though the reader understands by the end of the first paragraph why Silko \"was different\" (par. 1), the reader remains curious about why this difference is significant to S ilko.). Assessment(s) Analyze how Silko's explanation of what happened \"[i]n the 1880s\" (par. 1) orient s the reader . How does this make her argument clear and convincing? Student responses will be assessed using the 12.1.2 End -of-Unit Text Analysis Rubric. High Performance Response(s) A High Performance Response should: Analyze how Silko's explanation orients the reader Explain how the explanation makes her argument clear and convincing. Silko orients the reader by going back to a time before she was born to explain the reason for her difference, why she and her sisters \"didn't look quite like the other Laguna Pueblo children, but [they] didn't look quite white either\" (par . 1). Her great - grandfather was white \"married full -blood Laguna Pueblo wom[a]n\" (par . 1). Silko explains that the white side of her family or iginally came to where the Laguna Pueblo lived to \"survey the land for the U.S. government\" and \"send[] Indian children thousands of miles away from their families\" (par . 1). Including this information orients the reader by helping clarify why Silko's appe arance as both white and Indian is a significant issue for Silko to discuss.

If this sounds like you, then please share your story. If my life to date were a novel, the motif would be shoes . Shoes have made a huge impact on my life in ways varied and unexpected. In fact, a passion for shoes is a family trait. My father was a lo ng-distance runner and an early athletic shoe aficionado. He later became the CFO of an athletic shoe manufacturer where he help ed develop some of the first high-tech running shoes. Following in my father's footsteps, I acquired a great passion for learnin g about athletic shoes and I now have an impressive collection to match. Shoes have shaped my college and career plans, but their impact goes even deeper. Studying and collecting athletic shoes has taught me the value of a hard -earned dollar. When I was f ourteen, my mom gave me an ultimatum: \"Dad and I have been looking at the bills, and we have decided that unless you would like to eat shoes, you will have to get a job.\" I looked at the meticulously stacked shoeboxes towering over the rest of my room and made some quick calculations. \"I see your point,\" I replied. So I spent my summer poolside, not lounging around with a tall glass of lemonade, but standing over a deep fryer slinging fri es and onion rings at my community pool's snack bar. I faithfully sav ed half of every paycheck for college, and just as faithfully spent the other half on shoes. Pairs of slim metallic gold Air Max, orange filigree -embossed Foamposites, and a rare tie -dyed mash up of fabrics branded as \"What the Dunk\" all made their way int o my collection. By the end of that summer, I had enough stock in my collection that I decided to become a self -employed shoe entrepreneur, buying and selling shoes online at a handsome profit. I camped overnight in Center City Philadelp hia to get a prime place in line to purchase highly -coveted sneakers. I made some savvy investments, but I was also conned in an ill -advised Craigslist deal with an unscrupulous buyer. The challenges, rewards, and thrills of running a small business have fueled my decision t o major in business. A shared passion for shoes creates an instant connection with people I meet, whether in a suburban shopping mall or a trendy neon -lit Los Angeles sneaker store. I have learned that in some places, shoes are not a fashion statement or a status symbol. Rather, shoes enable a child to make an arduous trek to school and surmount a potential education barrier. When I first learned about the nonprofit organization, In Ian's Boots, I knew I found a way to unite my shoe passion with my mission to contribute positively to the world around me. Founded by the grieving parents of a fellow soccer goalie killed in a sledding accident, In Ian's Boots collects used sho es for people in need around the world. Doctors found a biblical message in his boots urging \"perseverance,\" and this story and message spoke to me. Last year, I hosted a drive and collected over 600 pairs of sh oes, some of which have been distributed to Honduras, Ghana, and Haiti. I am eager to continue my life's journey at a college where my passion, entrepreneurial spirit, and desire to effect social change can be ignited by a powerful educational experience. I can only imagine all the places my shoes will take me next.

Provide a description of the charter holder's philosophical approach to improving pupil achievement. Include how this philosophy has impacted the success of the existing school . If a different population will be served in the new school, how does this philosophical approach apply? Legacy Traditional School's globally accredited program of instruction provides a solid foundation of fundamental and higher thinking skills through a structured curriculum aligned to the Arizona College and Career Ready Stan dards that is consistent within each grade level and sequential throughout the grades. The kindergarten through eighth grade curriculum is taught using direct teaching techniques and whole class instruction. Our goal is to create and maintain a school cul ture where students are healthy, safe, engaged, supported and challenged. Our core values include work ethics, integrity, leadership, discipline, teamwork, and character. The \"Back to Basics\" academic model, emphasis on high expectations, structure, patrio tism, rigor, character, consistency and responsibility has gained positive community recognition in Avondale . This proven approach has improved pupil academic achievement as evident by the high pass and growth percentile measured by AZ Merit . This approach has also enabled pupils the ability to function highly as responsible citizens in society as evident by stakeholder satisfaction surveys and secondary school feedback. A market analysis suggests the population of the W. Surprise school will be similar t o the population of the Avondale school. 2. Describe the existing program of instruction of the current school, including methods of instruction and curriculum for the core academic co ntent areas, which supports this philosophy and aligns to Arizona Academic Standards . Legacy Tradition al School (\"LTS\") \"teach es the curriculum\" at the speed and pace in which it is intended. The methods of instructional delivery are designed to meet the needs of the high end of the class rather than slowing the delivery pace curriculum for a few. Students struggling a re provided with additional help , interventions and tools to succeed. LTS uses a direct instructional model, also known as \"Teacher -Centered I nstruction\" for all grades. The Teacher- Centered Instruction is a high ly focused method of direct instruction and scripted strategy which provides a fast pace and constant interaction between the teachers and stud ents . As noted by the National Institute for Direct Instruction , \"Direct Instruction is a model for teaching that emphasizes well -developed and carefully planned lessons designed around small learning increment s and clearly defined and prescribed teaching tasks. It is based on the theory that clear instruction eliminating misinterpretations can greatly im prove and a ccelerate learning\" . In keeping with the Direct Instructional model, LT S uses a method of instruction that features incremental skill introduction which provides sequentia l learning through progressive complex concepts and skills. Throughout the teaching process, teachers are sensitive to the needs of each individual student and carefully monitor their progress. The major benefit is that students receive instruction directly from a highly effective teacher, rather than from a peer, or through self- learnin g. In an effort to ensure the reliability of instruction, and the overall program of instruction, LTS employs a full -time Principal, two Assistant Principal s and an Instructional Coach at each campus. The LTS traditional program features a structured curriculum , aligned to Arizona College and Career Ready Standards, which develops a solid foundation of key skills and focuses on the achievement of high level thinking abilities. By adopting a uniform curriculum across all associate schools, LTS has maintained consistency within each grade level, and ensured sequential learning as student's advance to subsequent grades. This sequential growth begins the process of establishing a rich academic legacy within all students. As a back -to-basics pr ogram of instruction, an elevated emphasis is placed on Reading, Writing and Mathematics. In addition to the special emphasis on core subjects, LT S teaches Social Studies, Science, Physical Education, Music, Visual and Performing Arts, Library/Research, C omputers, and Foreign Language. The back -to-basics Language Arts curriculum at LTS utilizes the evidence based Spalding International Language Arts program along with Journeys for reading supplement . This phonics based curriculum is comprised of daily gra mmar instruction, spelling, vocabulary, continued reading fluency, comprehension instruction, and the six (6) traits of writing. This curriculum builds upon the skills mastered in the previous grades/lessons and continues to expand the knowledge of each st udent. This program exceeds the requirements of the Arizona LA standards. The back -to-basics Mathematics curriculum at LTS utilizes the evidence based Saxon program . This comprehensive, sequential and spiraling curriculum exceeds the requirements of the A rizona Common Core Standards - Mathematics and provides for a continual flow of learning through the incremental introduction of new concepts and ideas, which are mastered through daily practice. Mastery of each unit is required of eve ry student, with mast ery being 7 0% or higher. Through this approach , students can review daily what they learned previously , and add a new piece of knowledge to their vast growing storehouse of information. The certified and highly qualified i nstructors follow the evidence ba sed, Madeline Hunter's 7 S teps of Instruction in lesson planning and the implementation of the curriculum in their individual classrooms. The successful implementation Program of Instruction of the se steps provides students with a greater opportunity to effectively learn and ma ster the skills and concepts presented. 3. Present an explanation of how the implementation of the existing program of instruction meets the needs of the proposed target population . The target population is similar to our existing model school and is seeking a proven program of instruction offered by a globally accredited charter school system to provide a learning environment that improves student academic achievement. Legacy Traditional School has demonstrated the ability to implement its back -to-basics program of instruction to students in Kindergarten through eighth grade better than all other LEAs in the state. With over 18,000 students enrolled in fourteen , \"A\" rated associates schools located throughout the state, LTS h as the experience, infrastructure and capaci ty to meet the needs of this target population. The needs will be met by executing a complete replication of the implemented program of instruction seen at each of Legacy's schools. The key components of a proven formula that will be utilized to identify the initial essentials of the target pop ulation include communication, stakeholder engagement, professional development, assessment, data analysis, remediation, implementation and accountability . 4. Describe the level of proficiency th at students must obtain to demonstrate mastery of academic core content and clear criteria for promotion from one level to the next. Both Language Arts and Mathematics curricula are structured programs that align directly with Arizona standards to ensure the proper education of all students. Teachers work with individual students and their parents to ensure that they remain accountable for their progress and are learning the curriculum in the manner recommended. The LTS grading scale is reflected below fo r all grades. Students demonstrate mastery of a skill when they score an 7 0% or better on an assessment or when the instructor determines that they have mastered the skill, whether through direct observation and/or other means. LTS firmly believes that academic promotion is the way to best prepare students to succeed throughout their school years, and then throughout life. The LTS remediation program is designed to intervene early on, when concerns are first detected, to ensure all students are adequate ly prepared for promotion to subsequent grades. LTS has also developed a tiered approach for intervention to ensure that students are adequately prepared for prom otion to the next grade level . If students are promoted in the lowest tier in any subject are a, additional corrective action will be taken to ensure that students obtain full mastery in the subsequent year. Students will be promoted when they demonstrate proficiency of the fundamental skills that are needed to be successful at the next grade level . The retention of a student in his/her grade level is the final intervention step to ensure these skills are achieved before advancing to the next grade level. Students must demonstrate accomplishment of the standards in reading, writing, mathematics, sci ence, and social studies adopted by the Arizona State Board of Education. Legacy values all academic disciplines by providing a well -rounded program of instruction. The Promotion and Retention Policies reflect our back -to-basics philosophy, rooted in the b elief that all students will be successful across all disciplines when they are proficient in the foundational skills of reading, writing and mathematics. 2018 -2019 Legacy Traditional School Arizona Parent Handbook 41 Promotion Criteria for Grades K -6 Stud ents will be promoted in K - 6th grades when they have demonstrated proficiency of a combined 70% or above in the foundational academic subjects of language arts (writing, grammar, reading, spelling, and phonograms) and math at the conclusion of the school y ear. Promotion Criteria for Grades 7 -8 Students will be promoted in 7th/8th grades when they have demonstrated proficiency of a combined 70% or above in their core academic subjects of literature, English, math, science, and social studies at the conclusio n of the school year. K -8 Students Who Do Not Meet Promotion Criteria If the student does not meet the Promotion Criteria for his or her grade level, parents will be notified of all available interventions. Interventions may include, but are not limited to intensive tutoring, summer school and grade -level retention. 6. Operational Plan Attach a clear, specific and concise response regarding the operational plan for the entity requesting replication. The expected page length for all three questions is no more than one page. 6-1. Describe the organization's strategic growth plan and desired outcomes over the next five years in Arizona. Include: number of schools with grades served including expansion progression, projected opening dates, and projected number of students served. The organizational development plan estimates aggressive growth over the next five years. At a minimum, we aim for one school per year to be built in Arizona. Target start dates for these school s will continue to be based on neighboring schools . The organization currently serves over 18,000 K-8 students in the fourteen managed schools throughout Arizona . The organization project s to have a minimum of 20,000 students enrolled in Legacy Traditional School s by 2020. The organization will continue to explore additional grades served in cu rrent and future Legacy Traditional School s. Expansion to new and existing Legacy Traditional Schools will be regularly evaluated based on demand. 6-2. Discuss your operational capacity to open and operate schools successfully, including lessons learned from past expansion, and how you plan to avoid or minimize challenges in the replication school. The organization has successfully demonstrated the operational capacity to open and operate schools. In eleven academic years, the organizati on has opened fourteen schools and increased student enrollment from 389 to over 1 8,000. The over 100- member ESP provides support and related field expertise to existing and new schools. 6-3. Summarize the organization's capacity to support the quality and long -term academic and operational success and financial viability of the replication school, and proposed growth of the school . The organization has demonstrated the capacity to support high quality academic outcomes, operational success and positiv e fina ncial outcomes. Eleven of twelve Legacy Traditional Schools received an \"A\" label for their 2017 -2018 academic performances , the twelfth school being only one point from an \"A\" . Additionally, Legacy Traditional Schools have the greatest quantifiable operational success as measured by the highest student membership among all K -8 charter systems in the state . Finally, the replication school meets the Board's Financial Performance Expectations. The proposed growth of the school over the course of three y ears is based on the organization's findings from previous openings and the schools' three year trend. The organization forecasts the enrollment to be 70% of the school's capacity during its inaugural year and a 5% to 10% increase in enrollment each succee ding year. Target Population and Enrollment of New School 5-1. Describe the population of the Replication Model School, including the demographic profile, academic performance of students entering the school, and distance trave led by current students. The demographic profile shows a healthy blend of race and ethnicity at LTS - Avondale . Over 8 5% of LTS -Avondale students reside within a 10 -mile radius o f the campus and within the Littleton Elementary School District ( LESD). To determine the academic performance of students entering the school, an examination o f Littleton Elementary School District's 2016 SY AZ Merit/ AIMS Pass Rate (PR) results in comparison to AZ State results are provided in the chart below. Demographics AZ Merit Pass Rate LESD/AZ AZ Merit/AIMS Pass Rate LESD/AZ Asian or LESD 3rd Grade PR ELA/AZ 23/40 LESD 3rd Math/AZ 25/42 Black 9% LESD 4th ELA/AZ 29/46 LESD Math/AZ 26/44 LESD 5th 30/45 LESD 5th Math/AZ 29/46 American 1% LESD 6th ELA/AZ 25/38 LESD Math/AZ 28/39 LESD 7th 18/26 ELL 72% LESD Sci /AZ 45/60 Reduced LESD 8th Grade PR Sci /AZ 46/60 5-2. Identify the target population of the proposed school , demonstrating a clear understanding of the students the school intends to serve, including , whether the students will be primarily neighborhood or commuter, current levels of academic performance , and a demographic profile. Legacy Traditional School - West Surprise will target students within five miles of the intersection of N Citrus Rd and W Cactus Rd in Surprise, AZ . The area within this five -mile radius includes portions of the Dysart Elementary District . We anticipate the student population of LTS -West Surprise will be similar to the demographic characteristics of the Legacy Tradit ional School - Avondale . The majority of the students will be primarily neighborhood students in that they are expected to live/travel within 5 miles of the school, however , there most likely will be a small percentage of students who will live/travel greater than ten miles of LTS - West Surprise . The new campus will also absorb students from the current wait list of our Surprise campus. To determine the anticipated small percentage of students entering the school, an examination of the Dysart Elementar y District 201 8SY AZ Merit/AIMS Pass Rate (PR) results in comparison to AZ State results are provided in the chart below . 3rd Grade PR Math / ELA 4th Grade PR Math/ ELA /Science 5th Grade PR Math / ELA 6th Grade PR Math /ELA 7th Grade PR Math / ELA 8th Grade PR Math / ELA / Science detailed description of how the Charter Holder will meet the identified enrollment targets, along with a clear description of the advertising and promotional plan that supports the successful enrollment of the projected student count identified in the application and a timeline for enrollment at the proposed school and how it will be communicated to the public. Target Population and Enrollment of New School The need for a second school presented itself as a result of the continued waitlist at our Surprise campus which was around 600 students at the beginning of this 2018/19 school year, and is currently around 500 students for next school year 2019/20. Parents have readily requested LTS -Avondale to replicate in nearby communities to better serve the educational needs of their children. LTS -West Surprise has the capacity and infrastructure to provide the Surprise community with high -quality education and develop an educational environment that improves student academic achievement. In addition to improved education, LTS -West Surprise has the ability to provide a distinguished school facility and is the perfect partner for the city and community. The city of Surprise had an estimated population of 134, 085 as of July 2017 , according to most recent Census estimates . The es timated population growth between 2010 and 2017 was 14.1% and the forecasted population growth between 2018 and 2023 within a 5 -mile radius of LTS - Goodyear is 16.6%. The western portion of the valley has g rown rapidly in the past decade. There are 1 9,530 children aged 5 to 14 within a 5 -mile radius a school, and 10 ,182 within a 3 -mile radius of the school. According to the Arizona Department of Education, an Average Daily Membership (ADM) of 15,2 49 of studen ts in grades K -8 within a three -mile radius of t he proposed site was reported in 2 017- 18. LTS- West Surprise will target 1,4 40 of these studen ts whose parents seek a tuition -free, traditional education. Demographic analysis indicates a sufficient student population for LTS-Goodyear. A thorough competi tive analysis was also conducted and showed that the closest elementary schools from the site were B-rated by the Arizona State Board of Education, which would give us a competitive advantage in this market since Legacy Traditional School - Avondale is A-rated, as are 11 of 12 Legacy Traditional Schools in Arizona. Legacy Traditional School - West Surprise student recruitment and marketing efforts will include a mul ti-tiered messaging approach which will appeal to all types of families. All families within a 3-5-mile radius will be targeted to receive mailers, digital banners, Facebook paid campaigns a nd other materials such as door hangers if/when relevant for unique messaging. It is Legacy's practice to give every family in the community it serves an equ al opportunity to enroll. Lega cy has never filtered out lower -income families from its demographic and marketing -reach profile. Clear and transparent enrollment practices will be communicated at various community interest meetings, expressed in the student handbook and provided on the LTS website. 5-4. Describe the fair and equitable enrollment procedures and policies compliant with A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -184 of the Replication Model School that will be implemented at the proposed school, including the timeframe, waitlist, lottery an d documents included in the enrollment packet. Legacy Traditional School accepts all students with no specific geographic boundaries. The enrollment process will begin once authorization is granted and will continue until the school reaches capacity. All new students who submit a complete enrollment packet are accepted on a fir st-come -first served basis, with the following priorities: Students returning in the second or any subsequent year of enrollment; Children of employees and b oard members; Children with siblings already accepted into the program; Intra -district transfers; Students qualifying for the McKinney Vento program. In order for a student 's registration to be considered complete, parents must complete an electronic en rollment form; provide immunization records, proof of residency and the state residency form, an official birth certificate, the ESEA form, and PHLOTE form at the time of registration. Other documentation (Special Education IEP and MET, custody documents, Affidavit of Home School Instruction, promotion paperwork, discipline records, etc.) may be required for registration when they are applicable to the student. Upon initial enrollment and annually upon re -enrollment, parents and students will acknowledge th e School Policy Support Agreement re -establishing a commitment to comply with the rules and policies at Legacy Traditional School. Re -enrolling students will also resubmit the ESEA form and updated residency information (if applicable). Target Population and Enrollment of New School Section D.2: Planned Facility Attach the following information regarding the proposed location of the new school. D.2-1.

September 9, 2019 Board Meeting 1 AGENDA ITEM: Recent Updates to ASBCS Online Issue During the new Financial Performance Framework's development, stakeholders repeatedly expressed to the Board's Financial Framework Subcommittee (\"Subcommittee\") that the new financial dashboard must be easy to understand and user friendly. Further, the Sub committee considered additional transparency, including making the performance of the Board's portfolio more accessible. Financial Dashboard At the September Board meeting, staff will demonstrate the new financial dashboard. As a preview, examples of the n ew financial dashboard have been included with this staff report . Like the Board's operational dashboard, the new financial dashboard includes a summary view and an expanded, detailed view. DASHBOARD EXAMPLES The example \" Good Standing\" dashboard begins on page 3. Although not included in the meeting materials, the \"Adequate Standing\" dashboard will include the same level of information as the \"Good Standing\" dashboard. The differences will be that certain measures on the \"Adequate Standing\" dashboard will be rated \"Approaches Standard\" and will display with yellow triangles , and the \"Good Standing\" rating will be replaced with \"Adequate Standing: Meets the Board's Financial Performance Expectations ,\" which will display in yellow. The example \" Intervent ion\" dashboard begins on page 6 . Charter holders that receive an Intervention rating must submit information to the Board regarding the charter holder's financial performance. The Subcommittee's recommended framework, which was approved by the Board in Dec ember , indicated that efforts would be made to have all charter holder submissions and related Board communications accessible from the dashboard. When the \"Intervention\" rating is clicked, the user is taken to a webpage that includes this information (see page 8) . Thi s webpage is updated thro ughout the intervention p rocess . PLACE FOR CHARTER HOLDER EXPLANATION Based on feedback received during the Subcommittee's process, the new financial dashboard allows a charter representative to enter a brief explanation for the charter holder's financial performance that will display under the charter holder's dashboard. After the charter holder's fiscal year 2019 audit dashboard becomes available through ASBCS Online, the charter representative will be able to enter a n explanation (see page 10). To add an explanation, the charter representative must: 1. Log into ASBCS Online. 2. Access the \"Performance\" tab. 3. Scroll down to the bottom of the fiscal year 2019 or subsequent audit financial dashboard. 4. Click on \"Add explanation (optional).\" School Performance The Subcommittee also considered recommendations to promote transparency. One of those recommendations involved making the performance of the Board's portfolio more accessible. Through the new School Performance web page, which may be accessed at https://online.asbcs.az.gov/schools/performance , the public is able to access the school level academic performance and the charter holder level financial and operational performance of each open school in the Board's portfolio . The School Performance webpage includes the most current academic (fiscal year 2018) and operational (fiscal year 2019) performance ratings available under the Board's performance frameworks. The first financial performance rating will display after the fiscal year 2019 audit has been received and reviewed. The information that displays for each school will update as the individual dashboards are updated. The School Performance webpage also inc ludes a link to the \"Performance\" tab, which is the same link the Board's rules require schools to post on their websites. \"Good Standing \" Dashboard Example \"Intervention\" Dashboard Example Place for Charter Representative To Add Brief Explanation September 9, 2019 Board Meeting 5 DO THE CHARTER HOLDE R'S PROPOSED OR IMPL EMENTED ACTIONS ADDR ESS THE PROBLEMS THAT CONTRIBUTED TO OR CAUSED THE CHARTER HOLDER'S UNDERPERFORM ANCE ON THE FINANCIAL PER FORMANCE FRAMEWORK'S MEASURES AND ARE THEY REALISTIC TO IMPLEMENT?

Charter schools are expected to be wealthy; and not all have this financial status. Not all charters are for profit; especially the ones operating under a not for profit organization. Non-profits are not expected to make a profit. Also, there is no explanation on what is considered an \"acceptable\" answer to these 4 questions (enabling the school to continue to operate). The mechanism seems a bit \"subjective.\" Training (technical assistance) on the calculation of the different ratios would be beneficial. Thank you, Martha Camacho mcamacho@ypic.com 1 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 AGENDA ITEM EXECUTIV E SUMMARY: Compliance Matters \u2014Espiritu Community Development Corp . (Entity ID: 4335) Issue Pursuant to Arizona Revised Statute (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 15 -183(R) and Arizona Administrative Code (\"A.A.C.\") R7- 5-403(F), if the Board determines a charter holder does not meet the Board's minimum operational performance expectations, it shall consider the charte r holder's noncompliance and may subject the charter holder to additional charter oversight as outlined in Article 6 of the A.A.C , including issuing a notice of intent to revoke the charter contract. Pursuant to this rule, Espir itu Community Development Co rp. (\"Charter Holder\") has been placed on the agenda for the Board's consideration. The Charter Holder failed to meet the minimum operational performance expectations set forth in A.A.C. R7 -5-403 and the Board's operational performance framework when the C harter Holder received an overall rating for fiscal year 2019 of \"Does Not Meet the Board's Operational Performance Standard\" due to s ix of the nine O perational Performance Framework measures being rated \"Does Not Meet Standard .\" Policy Background \u2014Operati onal Performance Framework The Board shall annually assign a charter holder an overall operational performance rating based on measures specified in the Operational Performance Framework, which reflect the degree to which the charter holder achieved the mi nimum operational performance expectations . A.A.C. R7 -5-403(B). The Board shall determine a charter holder meets the minimum operational performance standard if the charter holder receives no measure rated \"Falls Far Below Standard\" and no more than five m easures rated \"Does Not Meet St andard\" for the evaluated year. A.A.C. R7 -5-403(C) . Charter Holder Background The Charter Holder was granted a 20- year renewal charter in 201 0. The Charter Holder operates one school, NFL YET College Prep Academ y (the \"School\"), serving grades 7-12 in Phoenix . For FY 2020, the Charter Holder is reporting an estimated count of 393 students as of August 1 5, 2019. For additional information on the Charter Holder, see Appendix A: Charter Holder Profile. Board staff conducted a n unscheduled site visit to the School on February 5 , 2019. At the visit, Board staff identified multiple compliance issues leading to marking the Charter Holder's operational dashboard and requiring submissions to bring the Charter Holder into compliance. Several of the issues were related to enrollment practices, governing board alignment, availability of instructional staff education background and work experience, and fingerprinting. See Appendix B : Onsite Visit Final Report for more detail. Outside of the issues identified during the school site visit, the Charter Holder was also out of compliance in its requirements to the Arizona Department of Education (\" ADE\") concerning services to English Language Learners (\"ELL\") and the Charter Holder' s Annual Financial Report. During the school site visit, Board staff met with school leader, Rosalva Lopez . See Appendix C: Communication Timeline for detailed information about Board contact with the Charter Holder. 2 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 Summary of the Operational Performance Measures Recorded in FY 2019 Measure Identified at Original Notification Date Original Due Date Status 1.b.

Arizona Department of Education - Annual Financial Report ADE N/A 10-15-18 Submitted October 20, 2018 1.b. English Language Learner Requirements ESSA \u00a7 1112(e)(3)(A)(B) requires that all Parental Notification and Consent Forms for students identified as English Language Learners (\"ELL\") be sent home within 30 days of the beginning of each school year or with in two weeks of a student registering during the school year. The form is to be maintained in the individual student's cumulative folder . Board staff reviewed the cumulative f iles for students identified as ELL. The cumulative files were missing the current Parental Notification and Consent Form for Student Placement in an English Learner Program. The Charter Holder's failure to properly maintain the required forms for ELL students resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determ ines whether a charter holder is adhering with the applicable education requirements defined in state and federal law. Subsequently, the Charter Holder submitted the required Parental Notification and Consent Forms to Board staff for review. 2.b. Attendance Practices Charter holders in Arizona are required to comply with all applicable statutes and rules regarding enrollment practices that do not violate the rights of students. A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 110; A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 184. During the school site visit, and during the process of reviewing materials submitted after the school site visit, the Board identified a violation in attendance practices. A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 901(A)(1) states that excused abs ences are defined by ADE. ADE defines an excused absence as an absence due to illness, doctor appointment, bereavement, family emergencies, and out- of-school suspensions.

The statute does not allow schools to deny students for suspension s or other disciplinary a ctions taken against them. The School's enrollment packet required students to provide discipline information other than expulsion history and stated that failure to disclose the information could result in termination of the student's placement . A.A.C. R7 -2-306(B) (1) and (2) (a), (b), and (c) require that a student's parent or legal guardian identify the primary or home language of all students on the enrollment form and the home language survey.

Board staff met with school elementary principal, Christina Gabaldon . March 21, 2019 Board staff emailed the Charter Representative, notifying her that the Onsite Visit Final Report ( \"report \") was available on the ASBCS Online system. Board staff marked the Charter Holder's operational dashboard for each non -compliance issue identified in the report . The Charter Holder was given a deadline of April 22 , 2019 to submit the required documentation detailed in the report. April 1 , 2019 Prior to the due date, the Charter Holder submitted the required documentation. After review of all submissions, Board staff issued a Site Visit Closeout notification to the Charter Holder . Board staff updated th e Charter Holder's operational d ashboard to reflect the closeout status. July 31, 2019 Board staff notified the Charter Holder of its Failure to Meet Operational Performance Expectations. The notification stated that the Charter Holder would be placed on the September 9, 2019 Board agenda for disciplinary action. August 1, 2019 School principal Christina Gabaldon called Bo ard staff for clarification about the Failure to Meet Operational Performance Expectations notification. 1 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 AGENDA ITEM EXECUTIV E SUMMARY: Compliance Matters \u2014George Gervin Youth Center, Inc. Issue Pursuant to Arizona Revised Statute (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 15 -183(R) and Arizona Administrative Code (\"A.A.C.\") R7 -5-403(F), if the Board determines a charter holder does not meet the Board's minimum operational performance expectations, it shall consider the charte r holder's noncompliance and additional charter oversight as outlined in Article 6 of the A.A.C., including issuing a notice of intent to revoke the charter contract. Pursuant to this rule, George Gervin Youth Center , Inc. (\"Charter Holder\") has been place d on the agenda for the Board's consideration. The Charter Holder failed to meet the minimum operational performance expectations set forth in A.A.C. R7 -5-403 and the Board's O perational Performance Framework when the Charter Holder received an overall rat ing for fiscal year 2019 of \"Does Not Meet the Board's Operational Performance Standard\" due to six of the nine O perational Performance Framework's measures being rated \"Does Not Meet Standard .\" Policy Background \u2014Operational Performance Framework The Board shall annually assign a charter holder an overall operational performance rating based on measures specified in the O perational Performance Framework, which reflect the degree to which the charter holder achieved the minimum operational performance expectations . A.A.C. R7 -5-403(B). The Board shall determine a charter holder meets the minimum operational performance standard if the charter holder receives no measure s rated \"Falls Far Below Standard\" and no more than five measures rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the evaluated year . A.A.C. R7 -5-403(C). Charter Holder Background The Charter Holder was granted a 15-year new charter in 201 1. The Charter Holder operates one school, George Gervin Prep Academy (the \"School\"), serving grades K -8 in Phoenix . For FY 2020, the Charter Holder is reporting an estimated count of 151 students as of August 1 4, 2019. For additional information on the Charter Holder, see Appendix A: Charter Holder Profile. Board staff conducted a n unscheduled site visit to the School on March 7 , 2019 and met with Brendly Singleton, School Principal and Samantha Davis, Academic Coach. At the visit, Board staff identified multiple compliance issues leading to marking the Charter Holder's operational dashboard and requiring submissions to bring the Charter Holder into compliance. Several of the issues were related to the enrollment policies , appropriate fingerprinting requirements for its staff, notification to parents, required teacher salary posting , insufficient governing board minutes and the charter's non compliance with responding timely to these issues. See Appendix B : Onsite Visit Final Report for more detail. Outside of the issues identified during the school site visit, the Charter Holder was also out of compliance in its requirem ents to the Arizona Depar tment of Education (ADE) concerning Classroom Site Fund (\"CSF\") submissions and testing improprieties during the 2018 -2019 AzMERIT test administration . See Appendix C: Communication Timeline for detailed information about Board con tact with the Charter Holder. 2 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 Summary of the Operational Performance Measures Recorded in FY 2019 Measure Identified at Original Notification Date Original Due Date Status 1.b.

Other Obligations USV 4-1-19 5-1-19 Teacher Salary Posting submitted by July 1, 2019 1.b. Data for Achievement Profile A.R.S. \u00a7 15-183(E)(4) requires a charter school to ensure it designs a method to measure pupil progress toward the pupil outcomes adopted by the State Board of Education (\"SBE\") pursuant to section 15 -741.01, including participation in the statewide assessment and the nationally standardized norm -reference achievement test as designated by the SBE. During the annual test observations conducted by ADE to ensure standardization of test administration and test security, the ADE identified \"two separate instances of te st improprieties\" at the School. Each instance is detailed in A ppendix D: Summary of AzMERIT Observations . Because the Charter Holder failed to administer the 2018 -2019 AzMERIT tests per the test administration directions , the ADE invalidated a specified number of tests. T he Charter Holder's failure to ensure the School administers the statewide assessments in accordance with the test administration directions resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder is adhering to the education requirements defined in state and federal law . 2.b. Enrollment Processes Charter holders in Arizona are required to comply with all applicable statutes and rules regardi ng enrollment and attendance practices that do not violate the rights of students. A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 110; A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 184. During the school site visit, and during the process of reviewing materials submitted after the school site visit, several violations regarding enrollment and attendance practices were identified. A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 828(G) places the responsibility to request a copy of the pupil's record on the enrolling school and states that the request must be made directly to the previous school and within fiv e days after 3 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 enrollment. The School's enrollment packet required documentation of previous grades or transcripts at the time of enrollment. Arizona law places the responsibility of requesting a pupil's record on the enrolling school and states that the request must be made directly to the previous school and within five days after e nrollment. A.R.S. \u00a7 15 - 828(G). In addition, Arizona law does not provide that suspension or retention may be a basis for determining enrollment eligibility. A.R.S . \u00a7 15- 184. The School's enrollment packet requested information on whether a student had been suspended or retaine d. The packet did include a disclaimer that the information would not be considered in making enrollment decision . Regardless of the disclaimer, informa tion contained in a pupil's record must be directly requested from the prior school and after enrollment. A.R.S. \u00a7 15-828 details the available options for families to present as proof of age and identity for the enrolling student. The School's enrollment packet did not indicate that families have the option to provide documentation other than a birth certificate as prescribed by A.R.S. \u00a7 15-828. A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -841(B) states , \"[a] pupil may be expelled for excessive absenteeism only if the pupil has reached the age or completed the grade after which school attendance is not required as prescribed in section A.R.S. \u00a7 15-802. The School's attendance policy indicates the school administration \"has full authority to take disciplinary action that may lead to expul sion.\" Attendance cannot be a condition of expulsion for students who have not yet reached the age of sixteen . A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -802(A). T he School serves students in grades K -8 and, therefore, students under the age of 16 for whom school attendance is required and expulsion for excessive absenteeism is not authorized . A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -872(C) states that \"[e]ach public school shall make full discloser of the requirements and exemptions [to proof of immunization] as prescribed in this section and section 15 -873.\" A.R.S . \u00a7\u00a7 15-872(E) and 15 -873(A) detail the available options and timelines for families to submit immunization records or a waiver. The School's enrollment packet did not indicate that families have the option to provide documentation other than a complete im munization record for enrollment. The packet required the immunization record to be submitted at the time of enrollment. A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -184(F) states, \" a charter school shall not limit admission based on ethnicity, national origin, gender, income level, disabling condition, proficiency in the English language or athletic ability .\" Charter schools may not require parents to identify the student's country of origin or citizenship status for enrollment purposes. The School's enrollment packet requested the student's country of birth. The Charter Holder's failure to comply with all applicable statu tes and rules regarding enrollment and attendance practices resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the O perational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder appropriately administers student admission and attendance. Subsequently, the Charter Holder timely submitted an updated enrollment packet which complied with all relevant Arizona Revised Statutes described above. An up dated Scholar/Parent Handbook that complies with the Arizona law regarding attendance was submitted after a second notification . 2.c. Fingerprinting A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -183(C)(5) requires that all persons engaged in instructional work directly as a classroom, laboratory or other teacher have a valid fingerprint clearance card (\"FCC\") issued by the Arizona Depar tment of Public Safety (\"DPS\"). During the school site visit, School staff was unable to provide a valid FCC for each of the six contracted tutors that were observed providing intervention instruction to the students in the classrooms . 4 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 The Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the O perational Performance Framework measure that determines compliance with maintaining a safe environment consis tent with state and local requirements. Subsequently, the Charter Holder timely provided a valid FCC issued by DPS for each of the tutors observed on the day of the site visit. 2.d. Teacher Resumes Pursuant to A.R.S . \u00a7 15-183(F), charter schools shall inform parents and guardians of the availability of the educational and teaching background and experience of all instructional staff members. During the school site visit, School staff did not provide evidence that the parents and guardians were informed of the availability of the educational and teaching background and experience of all instructional staff members . Due to its failure to comply with A.R.S . \u00a7 15-183(F) , the Charter Holder was Not Meet Standard\" for the operational perf ormance framework measure that determines a charter holder is transparent in its operations. Subsequently, the Charter Holder timely submitted a notification sent to parents that complies with A.R.S . \u00a7 15- 183(F) . 2.d. Open Meeting Law Charter school govern ing bodies are required to comply with A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 38-431.01- 09, Open Meeting Law. A.R.S. \u00a7 38-431.01(B) require s that public meeting minutes include the following : date, time, and place of meeting ; names of members of the public body present or absent; a general description of matters considered ; an accurate description of all legal actions proposed, discussed, or taken ; and the names of members who propose d each motion. The minutes shall also include the names of the persons, as given, making statements or representing material to the public body and a reference to the legal action about which they made statements or presented materials. During the school site visit, Board staff was provided the governing board minutes for the May 2018, June 2018, Nove mber 2018, December 2018, January 2019, and February 2019 meetings . Each of the meeting minutes contained various violations of O pen Meeting Law, to include: not listing some members as present or absent, not listing all members, agenda had action items th at were not addressed in the minutes . Due to its failure to comply with Open Meeting Law, t he Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines a charter holder is transparent in its operat ions. Subsequently, the Charter Holder timely submitted corrected board minutes which complied with Open Meeting Law. 2.e. Timely Submission s\u2014Classroom Site Fund A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 977(J) requires charter schools that receive Classroom Site Fund (CSF) monies to submit a report by November 15 of each year to the Superintendent of Public Instruction that provides an accounting of the CSF expenditures for the previous fiscal year and a summary of the results. Based on information provided to the Board by ADE , the Ch arter Holder was notified on December 17, 2018 that the fiscal year 2018 Classroom Site Project Narrative Summary (Narrative), which was due November 15, 2018, had not been submitted. The Charter Holder was given a deadline of January 14, 2019 to submit. T he Charter Holder failed to submit the Narrative by the given deadline. 5 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 The Charter Holder's failure to timely submit resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holde r is complying with its obligations to the Board. Subsequently, the Charter Holder was given a final deadline of January 22, 2019 to submit the Narrative. The Narrative was submitted to ADE on January 18th, and upon review of the Narrative , Board staff req uested follow - up information by February 4, 2019. The Charter Holder submitted a revised Narrative to ADE on January 25, 2019 , and upon review of the revised Narrative , Board staff requested additional follow -up information by February 12, 2019. On January 29, 2019, the Charter Holder submitted the final Narrative to ADE and the matter was closed out. 2.e. Timely Submissions \u2014Charter Governance A.A.C. R7 -5-303 requires that all charters submit amendment requests to the Board through ASBCS Online when making changes to the charter contract. During a review conducted before the school site visit, Board staff found that the Charter Holder's governing board members listed on the School's website was not in alignment with the governing board members listed on ASBC S Online . Furthermore, during the school site visit and the process of reviewing materials submitted after the school site visit, Board staff found that the December 2018, January 2019 and February 2019 governing board minutes listed several members that do not align with the members listed on ASBCS Online . Because the governing board of the Charter Holder differs from the one listed on ASBCS Online, the Charter Holder is required to update the governing board through the Board's amendment process. The Ch arter Holder's failure to timely submit an amendment request resulted in a second mark under the operational performance framework measure that determines whether a charter holder is complying with its obligations to the Board. Subsequently, the Charter Ho lder submitted an amendment request to ensure alignment between the board membership on the ASBCS Online and the membership as reflected in the governing board minutes reviewed by Board staff . 2.e. Timely Submission s\u2014Site Visit Required Documentation A.A.C . R7-5-505(F) and (G) require charter holders to demonstrate, by a specified date, compliance with all issues identified after a compliance check. The Charter Holder failed, on several occasions, to timely submit documentation required to demonstrate compliance with a number of operational issues. The Charter Holder was notified on Apr il 1, 2019 of its required submissions to demonstrate compliance following a site visit conducted March 7 , 2019. The Charter Holde r was given a deadline of May 1 , 2019 to submit. The Charter Holder did not submit all of the required documentation by the sp ecified deadline. Subsequently, the Charter Holder was g iven a final deadline of July 1 , 2019 to submit. The Charter Holder did not submit all of the required documentation by the specified deadline. See Appendix E: 30 Day Failure to Submit for more detai l. The Charter Holder's failure to timely submit resulted in a third mark under the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder is complying with its obligations to the Board. On July 5 , 2019, the last notification was sent to the Charter Holder outlining the remaining issue and the required documentation. See Appendix F : 7 Day Failure to Submit for more detail. The Charter Holder's failure to timely submit resulted in its first mark on the FY 2020 Operational Performance Dashboard under the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder is complying with its obligations to the Board. 6 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 Subsequently, the Charter Holder submitted documentation that demonstrated curr ent compliance with issues identified at the site visit. 3. Other Obligations \u2014Teacher Salary Posting Pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -189.05, each charter school is required to prominently post teacher salary information on its website homepage. During a review conducted before the school site visit, Board staff found that the School 's website did not have the req uired teacher salary posting . The Charter Holder's failure to post the required teacher salary information on its website resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder is complying with other obligations. On April 1, 2019, the Charter Holder was notified of its requirement to post teacher salary information on the homepage of its website. The Charter Holder was given a deadline of May 1, 2019 but failed to comply by the specified deadline. Subsequently, after a second notification and by July 1, 2019, the Charter Holder posted the required teacher salary information in compliance with A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -189.05. 7 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 APPENDICES A.

(Entity ID: 79926) Issue Pursuant to Arizona Revised Statute (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 15 -183(R) and Arizona Administrative Code (\"A.A.C.\") R7 -5-403(F), if the Board determines a charter holder does not meet the Board's minimum operational performance expectations, it shall consider the charte r holder's noncompliance and additional charter oversight as outlined in Article 6 of the A.A.C , including issuing a notice of intent to revoke the charter contract. Pursuant to this rule, Lifelong Learning Research Institute, Inc. (\"Charter Holder\") has b een placed on the agenda for the Board's consideration. The Charter Holder failed to meet the minimum operational performance expectations set forth in A.A.C. R7 -5-403 and the Board's O perational Performance Framework when the Charter Holder received an ov erall rating for fiscal year 2019 of \"Does Not Meet the Board's Operational Performance Standard\" due to seven of the nine Operational Performance Framework measures being rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\". Policy Background \u2014Operational Performance Framework The Board shall annually assign a charter holder an overall operational performance rating based on measures specified in the Operational Performance Framework, which reflect the degree to which the charter holder achieved the minimum operational performance expectations . A.A.C. R7 -5-403(B). The Board shall determine a charter holder meets the minimum operational performance standard if the charter holder receives no measure s rated \"Falls Far Below Standard\" and no more than five measures rated \"Does Not M eet Standard\" for the evaluated year . A.A.C. R7-5-403(C). Charter Holder Background The Charter Holder was granted a 20- year renewal charter in 2016. The Charter Holder operates one school, Lifelong Learning Academy (the \"School\"), serving grades K -8 in Tucson . The School received alternative designation in fiscal years 2017 and 2018 but was not renewed alternative status by the Arizona Department of Education (\"ADE\") in fiscal year (\"FY\") 2019. For FY 2020, the Charter Holder is reporting an estimated c ount of 20 students as of August 1, 2019. For additional information on the Charter Holder, see Appendix A: Charter Holder Profile. Board staff conducted an unscheduled site visit to the School on March 12, 2019. At the visit, Board staff identified multip le compliance issues leading to marking the Charter Holder's operational dashboard and requiring submissions to bring the Charter Holder into compliance. Several of the issues were related to the implementation of the School's current program of instructio n, policies related to enrollment, appropriate fingerprinting requirements for its staff, required teacher salary posting , insufficient governing board minutes and the charter's non compliance with responding timely to these issues. See Appendix B : Onsite V isit Final Report for more detail. Outside of the issues identified during the school site visit, the Charter Holder was also out of compliance in its requirements to ADE concerning services to students with disabilities and had a complaint substantiated due to violations with Open Meeting Law. During the school site visit, Board staff met with corporate and school governing board member s Robert Klem and Shirley Williamson . Ms. Williamson also serves as the school's front offi ce manager . School principal, c harter representative and corporate and school governing board member, Mary Lou Klem , was not in attendance. All three board members also serve on the corporate and school governing bod ies of Jack Thoman Air and Space Academy and Performing Arts Studio, a sister school under a separate charter being considered by the Board at the September 9, 2019 meeting.

Educational Program \u2014Mission Statement A.A.C. R7 -5-303 requires that all charters submit amendment requests to the Board through ASBCS Online wh en making changes to the charter contract. During a review conducted before the school site visit, Board staff found that the Charter Holder's mission on ASBCS Online was not in alignment with the operating mission on the Charter Holder's website. Because the mission statement of the Charter Holder differs from the mission listed in the charter contract , the Charter Holder is required to update its mission through the Board's amendment process. The Charter Holder's failure to ensure the School's mission ali gns with the charter contract resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the operational performance framework measure that determines whether a charter holder's educational program and operations reflects the essential terms of the educational program as described in the charter contract. Subsequently, the Charter Holder timely updated the Charter Holder's website to reflect the mission on file with ASBCS Online. 3 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 1.a. Educational Program \u2014Program of Instruction A.A.C. R7 -5-303 requires that all c harters submit amendment requests to the Board through ASBCS Online when making changes to the charter contract. During a review conducted before the school site visit, Board staff found that the Charter Holder's program of instruction in the charter contr act was not in alignment with the educational program described on the Charter Holder's website. Because the program of instruction of the Charter Holder differs from the one listed in the charter contract, the Charter Holder is required to update the prog ram of instruction through the Board's amendment process. Furthermore, during the school site visit, and during the process of reviewing materials submitted after the school site visit , Board staff did not see evidence that the School has a specified educa tional program to instruct students with autism or to provide a science, technology, engineering, and math (S.T.E.M.) curriculum. See Appendix D : Program of Instruction for more detail. The Charter Holder's failure to ensure the charter's program of instru ction is delivered in accordance with the charter contract resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder's educational program and operations reflect the essentia l terms of the educational program as described in the charter contract. Subsequently , after a second notification was sent by Board staff , the Charter Holder did not submit evidence of the School's program of instruction to support the educational models being implemented at the School. Instead, the Charter Holder submitted an explanation that minimally addresses the School's curriculum and programs. See Appendix E: 30 Day Failure to Submit - Program of Instruction for more detail. On June 18, 2019, a last notification was sent to the Charter Holder requesting the submission of a program of instruction amendment and evidentiary documentation to support the School's current educational models described above . See Appendix F : 7 Day Fai lure to Submit - Program of Instruction for more detail. No evidence has been submitted to the Board. 1.b. Services to Students with Disabilities A.R.S. \u00a7 15-183 (E)(7) requires that charter holders comply with \"all federal and state laws relating to the e ducation of children with disabilities in the same manner as a school district. \" On February 8, 2019, ADE's Exceptional Student Services ( \"ESS\") division notified Mrs. Mary Lou Klem, the authorized charter representative, that the School was out of compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\") following an on -site monitoring of the School's special education program. ESS identified areas of noncompliance in each of the four categories reviewed: Child Find, Evaluation/Reevaluation, Individualized Education Program, and Procedural Safeguards/Parental Participation. The School was issued a Corrective Action Plan (\"CAP\"). Due to its failure to comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 15-183(E)(7) , the Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the operational performance framework measure that determines a charter holder adheres with applicable education requirements defined in state and federal law. The Charter Holder was required to submit specified documentation to ADE to satisfy the outlined requirements in the CAP by April 8, 2019. No additional documentation has been submitted to ESS to close out the CAP. 4 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 2.b. Enrollment Process es Charter holders in Arizona are required to comply with all applicable statutes and rules regarding enrollment practices that do not violate the rights of students. A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 110; A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 184. During the school site visit, and during the process o f reviewing materials submitted after the school site visit, several violations regarding enrollment practices were identified. A.A.C. R7- 2-306(B) (1) and (2) (a), (b), and (c) require that a student's parent or legal guardian identify the primary or home language of all students on the enrollment form and the home language survey. The School's enrollment packet was missing the three required language questions on the enrollment form. A.R.S. \u00a7 15-828 details the available options for families to present as proof of age and identity for the enrolling student. The School's enrollment packet did not indicate that families have the option to provide documentation other than a birth certificate as prescribed by A.R.S. \u00a7 15-828. A.R.S. \u00a7 \u00a7 the available options and timelines for families to submit immunization records or a waiver. The School's enrollment packet did not indicate that families have the option to provide documentation other than a complete immunization record for enroll ment. The packet required the immunization record to be submitted at the time of enrollment. The Charter Holder's failure to comply with all applicable statu tes and rules regarding enrollment practices resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the operational performance framework measure that determines whether a charter holder appropriately administers student admission and attendance. Subsequently, the Charter Holder timely submitted an updated enrollment packet which complied with all releva nt Arizona Revised Statutes described above. 2.c. Fingerprinting A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -183(C)(5) requires that all persons engaged in instructional work directly as a classroom, laboratory or other teacher have a valid fingerprint clearance card (\"FCC\") issued by the Arizona Department of Public Safety (\"DPS\"). A.R.S. \u00a7 15-512 requires non -instructional staff to be fingerprint checked through DPS. During the school site visit, School staff was unable to provide a valid FCC for one substitute teacher and the appropr iate fingerprint check for a parent volunteer that was observed monitoring the students at the computer lab without supervision and for a staff member responsible for landscaping. The Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines compliance with maintaining a safe environment consistent with state and local requirements. Subsequently, the Charter Holder provided a narrative response indicating that the person responsible for landscaping h ad only visited the school once and that the School understood that a parent volunteer would require a valid FCC if the volunteer left the area of direct supervision (e.g. to supervise students in the computer lab). The response also stated that the FCC fo r the substitute teacher is current and was included in the submission to Board staff . However, n o evidence of a valid FCC was found in that submission. On June 18, 2019, a last notification was sent to the Charter Holder requesting a copy of a valid FCC. No evidence has been submitted to the Board that the substitute teacher has been issued a valid FCC by DPS. 5 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 2.d. Academic Performance Notification s Pursuant to A.R.S . \u00a7 15-114, charter schools \"shall not display any achievement, classification or ranking that was assigned by a public or private entity after the achievement, classification or ranking is no longer current unless the year of issuance of the achievement, classification or ranking is prominently displayed.\" During the school site visit, Board staff reviewed the School's current calendar and found the academic performance information was outdated. The calendar stated that the School was an \"A\" school and did not prom inently display the year the School was rated an \"A\" school . Due to its failure to comply with A.R.S . \u00a7 15-114, the Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the operational performance framework measure that determines a charter holder is tran sparent in its operations. Subsequently, the Charter Holder timely removed the statement from the School's current calendar. 2.d. Open Meeting Law Charter school governing bodies are required to comply with A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 38-431.01- 09, Open Meeting Law. A.R.S. \u00a7 38-431.02 requires public notice of all meetings of public bodies and outlines what the notices m ust include. A complaint filed against the Charter Holder on August 14, 2018 alleged that the Charter Holder had violated A.R.S. \u00a7 38- 431.02. According to t he 2017 audit for the Charter Holder, it indicated that these requirements had been met, therefore a complaint was filed for providing false information. After reviewing the complaint, the Charter Holder's response, and all follow up information requested , the complaint was substantiated and closed on December 17, 2018. A.R.S. \u00a7 38-431.01(B) require s that public meeting minutes include: date, time, and place of meeting ; names of members of the public body present or absent; a general description of matters considered ; an accurate description of all legal actions proposed, discussed, or taken ; and the names of members who propose d each motion. The minutes shall also include the names of the persons, as given, making statements or representing material to the public body and a reference to the legal action about which they made statements or presented materials. During the school site visit, Board staff was provided the governing board minutes for the June 20, 2018, July 2, 20 18, and October 15, 2018 meetings . Each of the meeting minutes contained various violations of O pen Meeting Law, to include: not listing absent or present members; not providing an accurate description of what legal action was taken; not listing the vote o f the motioning board member . Due to its failure to comply with Open Meeting Law , as described above , the Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the O perational Performance Framework measure that determines a charter holder is transparent i n its operations. Subsequently, the Charter Holder timely submitted corrected board minutes which complied with Open Meeting Law as required. 2.e. Timely Submissions \u2014School Name Change A.A.C. R7 -5-303 requires that all charters submit amendment requests to the Board through ASBCS Online when making changes to the charter contract. The charter contract for this school states that the name of the school is \"Lifelong Learning Academy\" . However , during the site visit, Board staff observed that the School's name on the building was \"Air and Space Academy .\" Additionally, at the time of the visit, this was the name listed on the School's website, enrollment materials, and handbook. Because the opera ting name of the school differs from the name listed in the charter contract, the Charter Holder is required to update the name properly through the Board's amendment process. A.A.C. R7 -5-303(D)(18). 6 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 Due to its failure to comply with A.A.C. R7 -5-303, the Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines a charter holder is complying with its obligations to the Board. Subsequently, the Charter Holder indicated it would not be changing the nam e of the School through the amendment process . Instead , it would make arrangements to change the electronic signage. On June 18, 2019, the last notification was sent to the Charter Holder requesting proof of the change in electronic signage on the school building. No evidence has been submitted to the Board to show proof of the change. 2.e Timely Submission s\u2014Complaint Response Pursuant to A.A.C. R7-5-507(C) , a charter holder complained against shall, within ten days after receiving a copy of the complaint, provide a written response to the Board that addresses each allegation, the statement of facts, and supporting evidence in the complaint. On August 15, 2018, the Charter Holder was notified of a complaint related to Open Meeting Law violations ( see 2.d. Open Meeting Law) , and a response was due by August 29, 2018. The Charter Holder failed to timely submit a response by the given deadline. The Charter Holder's failure to timely submit resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the operational p erformance framework measure that determines whether a charter holder is complying with its obligations to the Board. Subsequently, the Charter Holder was given a final deadline of September 6, 2018 to submit a response. The Charter Holder submitted a res ponse before the deadline. After reviewing the response, Board staff requested follow -up information and granted the Charter Holder a deadline of October 16, 2018. The Charter Holder failed to timely submit a response by the October 16 deadline. The Charte r Holder's failure to timely submit resulted in a second mark under the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder is complying with its obligations to the Board. The Charter Holder was given a final deadline of Octo ber 22, 2018 to submit the required follow -up information. The Charter Holder failed to timely submit a response by the given deadline. The Charter Holder's failure to timely submit resulted in a third mark under the operational performance framework measu re that determines whether a charter holder is complying with its obligations to the Board. The complaint was substantiated and closed on December 17, 2018. 2.e Timely Submission s\u2014Site Visit Required Documentation A.A.C. R7-5-505(F) and (G) require charter holders to demonstrate , by a specified date, compliance with all issues identified after a compliance check. The Charter Holder failed, on several occasions, to timely submit documentation required to demonstrate compliance with a number of operati onal issues. The Charter Holder was notified on April 19, 2019 of its required submissions to demonstrate compliance following the March 12, 2019 and given a deadline of May 20, 2019 to submit. The Charter Holder did not submit all of the required documen tation by the specified deadline. The Charter Holder's failure to timely submit resulted in a fourth mark under the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder is complying with its obligations to the Board. Subseque ntly, the Charter Holder was given a n extension and final deadline of June 10, 2019 to submit. The Charter Holder did not submit all of the required documentation by the specified deadline. See Appendix G: 30 Day Failure to Submit for more detail. The Charter Holder's failure to timely submit resulted in a fifth mark under the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder is complying with its obligations to the Board. 7 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 On June 18, 2019, a last notification was se nt to the Charter Holder outlining the remaining issues and the required documentation. See Appendix H: 7 Day Failure to Submit for more detail. No additional documentation has been submitted to the Board. 3. Other Obligations \u2014Teacher Salary Posting Pursu ant to A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -189.05, each charter school is required to prominently post teacher salary information on its website homepage. During a review conducted before the school site visit, Board staff found that the Charter Holder's website did not have the required teacher salary posting . The Charter Holder's failure to post the required teacher salary information on its website resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the operational performance framework measure that determines whether a charter holder is complying with other obligations. Subsequently, after a second notification, the Charter Holder posted the required teacher salary information in compliance with A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -189.05. 8 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 APPENDICES A.

Upon review of the lesson plans and discussion with Mrs. Branch, it is not evident that the School has a specified educational progr am to instruct students with autism or to provide a STEM education. Additionally, the Charter Holder's program of instruction does not address these educational models. As the program of instruction differs between what the School displays on its website and what is described in the charter contract and the Cha rter Holder has not submitted an amendment to properly update the program of instruction , the Charter Holder is in violation of its contract. Issue 2 An academic documentation review was conducted b y Board staff. A description of its findings is found in Appendix A: Program of Instruction - Lifelong Learning Academy. Provide the following: - Submission of an administratively complete program of instruction amendment request to properly update the char ter contract. - Evidence of a professional development plan for the 18 -19 school year for the School that aligns with the program of instruction and best practices. - Evidence of the selected curriculum, methods of instruction and assessment that support the educational models for students with autism and STEM education. - Evidence of curriculum alignment with state academic standards for core content areas and grade levels for the 18 - 19 school year.

Services to Student s with Disabilities A.R.S. \u00a7 15-183(E)(7) requires that charter holders comply with \"all federal and state laws relating to the education of children with disabilities in the same manner as a school district\" . In separate instances, the Charter Holder has violated this statute. On October 17, 2017, following an on -site monitoring visit, the ADE 's Exceptional Student Services (\"ESS\") division, notified the School that it was out of compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"). and issued a Corrective Action Plan (\"CAP\") . The Charter Holder was required to submit specified documentation to ESS within 60 days and additional documentation within one year of the date of the notification. 3 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 On October 26, 2018, the Charter Holder was notified by ESS that it had not submit ted the required documentation by the October 17, 2018 deadline, and that the Charter Holder's \"federal IDEA payments [would] be interrupted until such time as adequate compliance is achieved and the corrective action plan is closed out.\" Due to its failure to comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 15-183(E)(7) , the Charter Holder was rated a \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines a charter holder adheres with applicable education requirements defined in state and federal law. No additional documentation has been submitted to ESS to close out the CAP. On January 17, 2019, ADE's Dispute Resolution division notified the Charter Representative that the School was out of compliance with IDEA following a complaint investigation . The com plaint was substantiated by Dispute Resolution, and the School was issued a CAP . The Charter Holder was required to submit specified documentation to ADE to satisfy the outline d requirements in the CAP by February 18, 2019 and separate requirements by Marc h 4, 2019. The Charter Holder's failure to comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 15-183(E)(7) resulted in a second mark under the O perational Performance Framework measure that determines a charter holder adheres with applicable education requirements defined in state and federal law. The complaint was substantiated and closed June 20, 2019. 2.b. Enrollment Processes Charter holders in Arizona are required to comply with all applicable statutes and rules regarding enrollment practices that do not violate the rights of stude nts. A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 110; A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 184. During the school site visit, and during the process of reviewing materials submitted after the school site visit, the Board identified the following violations regarding enrollment practices : A.A.C. R7-2- 306(B) (1) and (2) (a), (b), and (c) require that a student's parent or legal guardian identify the primary or home language of all students on the enrollment form and the home language survey. The School's enrollment packet was missing the three questions on the enrollment form. A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -828(G) places the responsibility of requesting a pupil's record on the enrolling school and states that the request must be made directly to the previous school and within five days after e nrollment. The School's enrollment packet required students to provide discipline information other than expulsion history. In addition, Arizona law does not provide that suspension or retention may be a basis for determining enrollment eligibility. A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -184. A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 15 detail the available options and timelines for families to submit immunization records or a waiver. The School's enrollment packet did not indicate that families have the option to provide documentation other than a complete immunization record for enrollment. The packe t r equired the immunization record to be submitted at the time of enrollment. The Charter Holder's failure to comply with all applicable statues and rules regarding enrollment practices resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the O perational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder appropriately administers student admission and attendance. Subsequently, the Charter Holder submitted an updated enrollment packet which complied with all relevant Arizona Revised Statutes described above. 4 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 2.c. Fingerprinting A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -183(C)(5) requires \"[a]all persons engaged in instructional work directly as a classroom, laboratory or other teacher have a valid fingerprint clearance card \" (\"FCC\") issued by the Arizona Department of Public Safety (\"DPS\"). During the school site visit, School staff was unable to provide a valid FCC for the special education teacher who was not on site at the time of the visit. The Charter Holder was ra ted \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the O perational Performance Framework measure that determines compliance with maintaining a safe environment consistent with state and local requirements. Subsequently, the Charter Holder submitted the required valid FCC for the identified staff member. 2.d. Academic Performance Notification s Pursuant to A.R.S \u00a7 15-114, charter schools \"shall not display any achievement, classification or ranking that was assigned by a public or private entity after the achievement, classification or ranking is no longer current unless the year of issuance of the achievement, clas sification or ranking is prominently displayed.\" During the school site visit, Board staff reviewed the School's current calendar and found the academic performance information was outdated. The calendar stated that the School was an \"A\" school and did not indicate the year for which the \"A\" rating had been earned . Due to its failure to comply with A.R.S \u00a7 15-114, the Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines a charter holder is tran sparent in its operations. Subsequently, the Charter Holder removed the statement from the School's current calendar. 2.d. Board Alignment Pursuant to A.A.C. R7 -5-505(C), Board staff may conduct a compliance check of a charter holder's operational performa nce at any time . Compliance checks are conducted before a site visit.

During the compliance check conducted before the school site visit, Board staff found that the Charter Holder's board members as reported through ASBCS Online and with the A CC were not aligned. Due to its failure to maintain alignment between the p rincipals identified in the charter contract and with the ACC , the Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the O perational Performance Framework measure that determines a charter holder is transparent in its operations. Subsequently, the Charter Holder filed the required documentation to align the corporate board members listed with ASBCS Online and the ACC. 2.d. Open Meeting Law Charter school governing bodies are required to comply with A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 38-431.01- 09, Open Meeting Law.

Due to its failure to comply with A.R.S. 15 -183(F), the Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines a charter holder is transparent in its operations. Subsequently, the Charter Holder provided documentation of the special education teacher's educational and teaching background that complies with A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -183(F) A.A.C. -5-507(C), a \"charter holder complained against shall, within 10days after receiving a copy of the complaint, provide a written response to the Board that addresses each allegation, the statement of facts, and supporting evidence in the complaint. \" On August 15, 2018, the Charter Holder was notified of a complaint related to Open Meeting Law (see 2.d. Open Meeting Law) , and that a response was due by August 29, 2018. The Charter Holder responded timely . Board staff reviewed the submission and requested follow -up information to be submitted by October 16 , 2018. The Charter Holder failed to timely submit a response by the given deadline.

The Charter Holder operates one school, Montessori House Charter S chool (the \"School\"), serving grades K -6 in Mesa . For FY 2020, the Charter Holder is re porting an estimated count of 33 students as of August 1 4, 2019. For additional information on the Charter Holder, see Appendix A: Charter Holder Profile. Board staff c onducted a n unscheduled site visit to the School on February 20, 2019. At the visit, Board staff identified multiple compliance issues leading to marking the Charter Holder's operational dashboard and requiring submissions to bring the Charter Holder into compliance. Several of the issues were related to the enrollment policies, appropriate fingerprinting requirements for its staff, required teacher salary posting , insufficient governing board minutes , availability of the instructional staff 's education background and work experience and the charter's noncompliance with responding timely to these issues. See Appendix B : Onsite Visit Final Report for more detail.

Enrollment Processes Charter holders in Arizona are required to comply with all applicable statutes and rules regarding enrollment practices that do not violate the rights of students. A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 110; A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 184. During the school site visit, and during the process of reviewing materials submitted after the school site visit, the Board identified a violation in the School's enrollment practices. A charter school cannot require parent involvement or a sum of money as a condition of enrollment or continued enrollment. A.R.S. \u00a7 15-185(B)(6) . The Parent Vo lunteer Contract, included in the enrollment packet indicated that parents are \"both encouraged and required to be actively engaged in the school\" and \"Parents must volunteer to be on at least 2 committees during each school year.\" The Charter Holder's fai lure to comply with applicable statu tes and rules regarding enrollment practices resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the O perational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder appropriately administers student a dmission and attendance. Subsequently, the Charter Holder submitted an updated enrollment packet which complied with all relevant Arizona Revised Statutes described above. 2.c. Fingerprinting A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -183(C)(5) requires that \"[a]ll persons engaged in instructional work directly as a classroom, laboratory or other teacher have a valid fingerprint clearance card \" (\"FCC\") issued by the Arizona Department of Public Safety (\"DPS\"). During a school site visit, and during the process of reviewing materials submitted after the school site visit, School staff was unable to provide a valid FCC for the instructional aide, Art teacher and Special Education teacher . The Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the O perational Performance Framework measure that determines compliance with maintaining a safe environment consistent with state and local requirements. 3 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 Subsequently on the day of the site visit, the Charter Holder emailed valid FCCs for the contrac ted Special Education teacher and a narrative response indicating that the Art teacher's last day of instruction was February 19, 2019 and the Art teacher would no longer be at the School. Additionally, Board staff received documentation showing that the instructional aide's FCC application was \"in process\" with DPS. Upon review of the instructional aide's FCC application on the DPS website, Board staff found that as of March 19, 2019 the status was \"Application Completed - Results mailed to applicant.\" On July 12, 2019, the Charter Holder submitted the results mailed to the instructional staff member indicating a good cause exception for a Level I fingerprint clearance card was granted . 2.d. Teacher Resumes A.R.S . \u00a7 15-183(F) requires a charter school to k eep in the \"personnel file of all current employees who provide instruction to students at the charter school information about the employee's educational and teaching background and experience in a particular academic content subject area \". Furthermore, a charter school shall inform parents and guardians of the availability of the informat ion regardin g the educational and teaching background and experience of all instructional staff members. A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 183(F). During the school site visit, School staff was unable to provide the educational and teaching background and experience for six instructional staff members and did not provide evidence that the parents and guardians were informed of the availability of the educational and teaching background and expe rience of all instructional staff members. Due to its failure to comply with A.R.S . \u00a7 15-183(F) , the Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines a charter holder is transparent in its operations. Subsequently, the Charter Holder submitted a notification sent to parents that complies with A.R.S . \u00a7 15-183(F) . The School posted a statement on its website that states, \" All instructional staff Vita's are available in the front office.\" 2.d. Open Meeting Law Charter school governing bodies are required to comply with A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 38-431.01- 09, Open Meeting Law.

The minutes shall also include the names of the persons, as given, making statements or representing material to the public body and a reference to the legal action about which they made statements or presented materials. At the time of the site visit, the 3 -member school governing body included two me mbers of the corporate board. Any time both members are present at the corporate board meetings constitutes a quorum of the school governing body . If matters related to the school are discussed when both members are present, the meeting will be subject to Open Meeting Law. During the school site visit, and during the process of reviewing materials submitted after the school site visit, several violations of Open Meeting Law were identified in the March 28, 2019 corporate board meeting minutes and the April 18, 2019 school governing body meeting minutes. Due to its failure to comply with Open Meeting Law , as described above , the Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the O perational Performance Framework measure that determines a charter holder is transparent in its operations. Subsequently, the Charter Holder submitted corrected board minutes which complied with Open Meeting Law as required. 4 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 2.e. Timely Submissions \u2014School Governing Body A.A.C. R7 -5-303 requires that all charters submit amendment requests to the Board through ASBCS Online when making changes to the charter contract. During the school site visit, and during the process of reviewing materials submitted after the school site visit, Board staff found that the school governi ng body meeting minutes listed one member that did not align with the members listed on ASBCS Online . Because the school governing body of the Charter Holder differs from the one listed on ASBCS Online, the Charter Holder is required to update the school g overning body through the Board's amendment process. Due to its failure to comply with A.A.C. R7 -5-303, the Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines a charter holder is complying with its obligations to the Board. The Charter Holder subsequently submitted an amendment request to ensure alignment between ASBCS Online and the board membership currently reflected . 2.e Timely Submission s\u2014Site Visit Required Documentation A.A.C. R7-5-505(F) and (G) require charter holders to demonstrate , by a specified date, compliance with all issues identified after a compliance check.

The Charter Holder was notified on March 21 , 2019 of its required submissions to demonstrate compliance following a site visit conducted on February 20, 2019. The Charter Holder was given a deadline of April 22, 20 19 to submi t compliance documentation. The Charter Holder did not submit any documentation by the specified deadline. The Charter Holder's failure to timely submit resulted in a second mark under the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder is complying with its obligations to the Board. Subsequently, the Charter Holder was given a final deadline of April 30 , 2019 to submit the required documentation. The Charter Holder did not submit all of the required do cumentation by the specified deadline. See Appendix D : 30 Day Failure to Submit for more detail. The Charter Holder's failure to timely submit resulted in a third mark under the O perational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter ho lder is complying with its obligations to the Board. On May 31 , 2019, a last notification was sent to the Charter Holder outlining the remaining issues and the required documentation. See Appendix E : 7 Day Failure to Submit for more detail.

A copy of the School's policies for hiring an individual prior to obtaining a FCC must be provided along with the procedures that will be used in accordance with the polices and compliance with to A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 183.C .5. A copy of the results mailed by DPS to Ms. Barba regarding the FCC application. The Charter Holder submitted the following: The required policies addressing the fingerprinting requirements A narrative describing the steps taken to ensure compliance with fingerprinting requirements A duplicate copy showing Ms. Barba's FCC application has a status of \"In Process . This was the same documentation submitted to Board staff by the School on February 20, 2019. Board staff checked the status of the application on May 30, 2019 , and the results state, \"Application Complete - Results mailed to applicant.\" Current submission requirement: A copy of the results mailed by DPS to Ms. Barba regarding the FCC application. 5 The submission was deemed insufficient because the Charter Holder did not submit the results of Ms. Barba's FCC application, as requested. Teacher Salary Posting Initial submission requirement: A screenshot of or link to the updated website home page with the required teacher salary posting. The Charter Holder submitted a screenshot of the School's webpage showing a link titled \"Teacher Salary Listing\" . The required documentation was deemed insufficient because the link provided to Board staff is not found on the School's website. In stead the School's home webpage states \" Teacher's salary is between $40,000 -$45,000 based on experience and education. \" This is not a link but a statement. (See Appendix A: School's webpage) The School is still missing all four components of the required teacher salary posting as detailed in the next column. Current submission requirement: A screenshot of or link to the updated website home page with the teacher salary posting with all required information per A.R.S. \u00a715 -189.05: o The average salary of all teachers employed by the charter school for the current year. o The average salary of all teachers employed by the charter school for the previous year. o The dollar increase in the average salary of all teachers employed by the chart er school for the current year. o The percentage increase in the average salary of all teachers employed by the charter school for the current year. 6 Open Meeting Law This is a new compliance issue. Board staff requested meeting minutes for all meetings held by the corporate board and school governing body in January, February, and March. The Charter Holder provided the following meeting minutes : January 17, 2019 board meeting for Montessori House, Inc. February 28, 2019 board meeting for Montessori House, Inc. March 7, 2019 board meeting for Montessori House, Inc. March 28, 2019 board meeting for Montessori House, Inc. April 18, 2019 school governing board meeting for Montessori House Charter School Upon review by Board staff, the following deficiencies were found: 1. The M arch 28, 2019 board meeting minutes list the following members as present: - Sherie Richardson - Wayne Strong - Daniel Lovell - Richard Eldridge The minutes do not list member Justen Judd as being present or absent. Sher yl Richardson and Wayne Strong are also members of the 3 member school governing body which is subject to open meeting law. Both members being present at the corporate board meeting s (as seen in the January, February and March board meeting minutes) is a quo rum of the school governing body and matters related to the school were discussed ; therefore, the corporate board meetings during which Sher yl Richardson and Wayne Strong are in attendance are subject to open meeting law (OML) and must comply with OML stat ute. 2. The April 18, 2019 school governing body meeting minutes list the following members as present: - Sheryl Richardson - Wayne Strong The meeting minutes also list the following Provide the following: Documentation from the March 28, 2019 and April 18, 2019 demonstrating compliance with A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a738 -431.01(B), (C), (D) and -431.03(B) that require public meeting minutes include: o Date, time, and place of meeting. o Names of members of the public body present or absent. o A general description of matters considered. o An accurate description of all legal actions proposed, discussed, or taken, including a record of how each member voted and the names of members who propose each motion. The minutes shall also include the names of the persons, as given, making statements o r representing material to the public body and a reference to the legal action about which they made statements or presented materials. 7 attendees and refers to them as \" board members present\" : - Daniel Lovell - Richard Eldridge - Justen Judd The school governing body as listed on ASBCS Online consists of Sheryl Richardson, Wayne Strong, and Duane Oakes. Daniel Lovell, Richard Eldridge, and Justen Judd are not school governing body members; however, Daniel Lovell and Richa rd Eldridge motion and second, respectively , on two actions listed in the minutes. Voting is listed as \"unani mous\" meaning that Justen Judd participated in voting, as well, as he is listed in the minutes as a board member. Duane Oakes is not listed as pres ent or absent in these minutes . Since the April minutes describe action taken by the school governing body, they are subject to OML and must comply with OML statute. Recorded in Measure 2.d.: Open Meeting Law 8 Appendix A: 1 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 AGENDA ITEM EXECUTIV E SUMMARY: Compliance Matters \u2014Victory High School, Inc. Issue Pursuant to Arizona Revised Statute (\"A.R.S.\") \u00a7 15 -183(R) and Arizona Administrative Code (\"A.A.C.\") R7 -5-403(F), if the Board determines a charter holder does not meet the Board's minimum operational performance expectations, it shall consider the charte r holder's noncompliance and may subject the charter holder to additional charter oversight as outlined in Article 6 of the A.A.C, including issuing a notice of intent to revoke the charter contract. Pursuant to this rule, Victory High School, Inc. (\"Chart er Holder\") has been placed on the agenda for the Board's consideration. The Charter Holder failed to meet the minimum operational performance expectations set forth in A.A.C. R7 -5-403 and the Board's O perational Performance Framework when the Charter Hold er received an overall rating for fiscal year 2019 of \"Does Not Meet the Board's Operational Performance Standard\" due to six of the nine O perational Performance Framework measures being rated \"Does Not Meet Standard .\" Policy Background \u2014Operational Performance Framework The Board shall annually assign a charter holder an overall operational performance rating based on measures specified in the O perational Performance Framework, which reflect the degree to which the charter holder achieved the minimum opera tional performance expectations . A.A.C. R7 -5-403(B). The Board shall determine a charter holder meets the minimum operational performance standard if the charter holder receives no measure rated \"Falls Far Below Standard\" and no more than five measures rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the evaluated year . A.A.C. R7 -5-403(C). Charter Holder Background The Charter Holder was granted a 20- year renewal charter in 2010. The Charter Holder operates one school, Victory High School - West Campus (t he \"School\"), serving grades 9 -12 in Phoenix . For FY 2020, the Charter Holder is re porting an estimated count of 23 students as of August 1 4, 2019. For additional information on the Charter Holder, see Appendix A: Charter Holder Profile. Board staff condu cted a n unscheduled site visit to the School on March 27 , 2019. At the visit, Board staff identified multiple compliance issues leading to marking the Charter Holder's operational dashboard and requiring submissions to bring the Charter Holder into complia nce. Several of the issues were related to the School's current program of instruction, enrollment policies, appropriate fingerprinting requirements for its staff, required teacher salary posting , insufficient governing board minutes , availability of the instructional staff 's education background and work experience and the charter's noncompliance with responding timely to these issues. See Appendix B: Onsite Visit Final Report for more detail. Outside of the issues identified during the school site visit, the Charter Holder was also out of compliance due to issues identified in the Charter Holder's FY 2018 audit . Additionally, the Charter Holder signed an F School Consent Agreement in FY 2019 due to receiving an \"F\" letter grade. During the school site vis it, Board staff met with Dr. Shirley Branham, the School's principal, charter representative and corporate and school governing board member , and Jacque Jackson, assistant principal and corporate and school governing board member. See Appendix C: Communic ation Timeline for detailed information about Board contact with the Charter Holder. 2 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 Summary of the Operational Performance Measures Recorded in FY 2019 Measure Identified at Original Notification Date Original Due Date Status 1.a.

Educational Program \u2014Program of Instruction A.A.C. R7 -5-303 requires that all charters submit amendment requests to the Board through ASBCS Online when making changes to the charter contract. During the school site visit, and during the process of reviewing materials submitte d after the school site visit, Board staff observed a blended learning approach in the classrooms visited. The Charter Holder's contract does not provide for a blended program of instruction. The presentation of the School's program of instruction provided by the charter representative at the site visit did not align with the Charter Holder's program of instruction in the charter contract. Consequently , the Charter Holder is required to update the program of instruction through the Board's amendment process . The Charter Holder's failure to ensure the charter's program of instruction is delivered in accordance with the charter contract resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the O perational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder's educational program and operations reflect the essential terms of the educational program as described in the charter contract. Board staff sent two notification s to which the Charter Holder did not submit a program of instruction amendmen t request to update the charter contract. Instead, the Charter Holder submitted an explanation that described the change in the program of instruction for the School . On June 24, 2019, a last notification was sent to the Charter Holder requesting the subm ission of a program of instruction amendment to support the School's current program of instruction . On July 29, 2019, the Charter Holder submitted a program of instruction amendment request that has been approved . 3 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 2.b. Audit Corrective Action Plan (\"CA P\") A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -901 specifies school requirements for reporting student membership and absences to the Arizona Department of Education (\"ADE\"). A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -914(G) requires \"[e]very charter school and school district audit to include a systematic review of average daily membership . . . using a methodology that is consistent with guidelines established by the a uditor general \". The \"systematic review\" is included in the Board's Legal Compliance Questionnaire. The Charter Holder's FY 2018 Legal Compliance Questionnaire indicated, \"The School did not provide information uploaded to ADE (AzEDS ADM15 report) to compare to the School's computerized attendance system records.\" As a result, the auditor was unable to d etermine the overall accuracy of the membership and absence data reported by the Charter Holder to ADE and used to determine the Charter Holder's FY 2018 state equalization assistance. The Charter Holder received a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for t he operational performance framework measure that determines whether the charter holder is administering student admission and attendance appropriately. In accordance with A.A.C. R7 -5-504(G) and the Board's Audit & Compliance Questionnaire Follow -up Matri x (\"audit matrix\"), staff notified the Charter Holder on January 24, 2019 that a CAP must be submitted. The audit CAP was timely completed on February 7, 2019. 2.b. Enrollment Processes Charter holders in Arizona are required to comply with all applicable statutes and rules regarding enrollment practices that do not violate the rights of students. A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 110; A.R.S. \u00a7 15- 184. During the school site visit, and during the process of reviewing materials submitted after the school site visit, a violation w as identified regarding enrollment practices : A.R.S. \u00a7 \u00a7 15-872(E) and 15 -873(A) detail the available options and timelines for families to submit immunization records or a waiver. The School's enrollment packet did not indicate that families have the optio n to provide documentation other than a complete immunization record for enrollment. The packet required the immunization record to be submitted at the time of enrollment. A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -184(A) requires a charter school to \"enroll all eligible pupils who sub mit a timely application, unless the number of applications exceeds the capacity of a program, class, grade level or building.\" Arizona law also places the responsibility of requesting a pupil's record on the enrolling school and states that the request must be made directly to the previous school and within five days after enrollment. A.R.S. \u00a7 15 - 828(G). The School's enrollment packet required documentation of previous transcripts at the time of enrollment. The Charter Holder's failure to comply with applicable statu tes and rules regarding enrollment practices resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder appropriately administers student admission and a ttendance. Subsequently, the Charter Holder submitted an updated enrollment packet which complied with all relevant Arizona Revised Statutes described above. 2.c. Fingerprinting A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -183(C)(5) requires \"[ a]ll persons engaged in instructional work directly as a classroom, laboratory or other teacher or indirectly as a supervisory teacher, speech therapist or principal to have a valid fingerprint clearance card \" (\"FCC\") issued by the Arizona Department of Public Safety (\"DPS\") . In separate instances, the Charter Holder has violated this statute. 4 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 The Charter Holder's FY 2018 audit indicated, \"For one employee required to have a valid FCC, the School had a FCC that expired on May 14, 2018 on file as of the testing date of June 6, 2018.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 41- 1758.08 authorizes the use of an expired FCC to satisfy the fingerprint requirements of A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 15 -183 and 15 -512 with the appropriate affidavit signed by the holder of the expired FCC. The Charter Holder did not have the appropriate signed affidavits for t he employee on file. In accordance with A.A.C. R7 -5-504(G) and the Board's audit matrix, staff notified the Charter Holder on January 24, 2019 that a CAP must be submitted. The audit CAP was timely completed on February 7, 2019. The Charter Holder receiv ed a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the operational performance framework measure that determines whether the charter holder is maintaining a safe environment consistent with state and local requirements. During the March 27, 2019 school site visit, and during the process of reviewing materials submitted after the school site visit, School staff was unable to provide a valid FCC for the long -term volunteer that Board staff observed solely supervising a classroom of students working in the computer lab . The Charter Holder's failure to comply with A.R.S. \u00a7 15-183(C)(5) resulted in a second mark under the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines compliance with maintaining a safe environment consistent with state and local re quirements. On June 24, 2019, a last notification was sent to the Charter Holder requiring a copy of the volunteer's FCC. Subsequently, on June 25, 2019, the Charter Holder sent an email to Board staff stating that the long -term volunteer had made an appo intment with a fingerprinting management service. However, the long -term volunteer had a family emergency and left town , and the Charter Holder has not been in contact with the volunteer since he left. The Charter Holder informed Board staff that the volunteer would no longer be working at the School. 2.d. Teacher Resumes A.R.S . \u00a7 15-183(F) requires a charter school to keep in the personnel file of all current employees who provide instruction to students at the charter school inf ormation about the employee's educational and teaching background and experience in a particular academic content subject area. During the school site visit, School staff was unable to provide the educational and teaching background and experience for twe lve instructional staff members . Due to its failure to comply with A.R.S . \u00a7 15-183(F) , the Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines a charter holder is transparent in its operations . Subsequently, the Charter Holder submitted the resumes for the instructional staff members in compliance with A.R.S . \u00a7 15-183(F). 2.d. Open Meeting Law Charter school governing bodies are required to comply with A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 38-431.01- 09, Open Meeting Law. A.R.S. \u00a7 38-431.01(B) require s that public meeting minutes in clude the following : date, time, and place of meeting ; names of members of the public body present or absent; a general description of matters considered ; an accurate description of all legal ac tions proposed, discussed, or taken ; and the names of members who propose d each motion. The minutes shall also include the names of the persons, as given, making statements or representing material to the public body and a reference to the legal action about which they made statements or presented materials. 5 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 On November 6, 2018, the Charter Holder received a Failing School Notification letter indicating that the school operated by the Charter Holder was assigned an \"F\" letter grade for FY 2018. This notification outlined the requirements under A.A.C. R7 -5-602(C), which included submitting to Board staff the minutes approving the signing of the consent agreement. During the process of reviewing the minutes, Board staff identified several violations of the Open Meeting Law in the December 14, 2018 governing board meeting minutes. Due to its failure to comply with Open Meeting Law , as described above , the Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the O perational Performance Framework measure that determines a charter holder is transparent in its operations. Subsequently, the Charter Holder submitted corrected board minutes which complied with Open Meeting Law as required. 2.d. Board Alignment Pursuant to A.A.C. R7 -5-505(C), Board staff may conduct a compliance check of a charter holder's operational performance at any ti me. Compliance checks are conducted prior to a charter holder being considered by the Board . For the purpose of a compliance check, a charter holder is in compliance if any measure on its operational dashboard rated \"Does Not Meet Standard \" or \"Falls Far Below Standard \" in the current year and/or the prior fiscal year has been addressed , the charter holder is in \"good standing\" with the Arizona Corporation Commission (\"ACC\") , and the charter holder is maintaining alignment between the p rincipals identified in the charter contract and with the ACC. During the compliance check conducted, Board staff found that the Charter Holder's board as reported through ASBCS Online and the board as listed with the ACC were not aligned. Due to its failure to maintain align ment between the p rincipals identified in the charter contract and with the ACC, the Charter Holder was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the O perational Performance Framework measure that determines a charter holder is transparent in its operations. Subs equently, the Charter Holder filed the required documentation to align the corporate board members listed with ASBCS Online and the ACC. 2.e Timely Submission s\u2014Site Visit Required Documentation A.A.C. R7-5-505(F) and (G) require charter holders to demonstrate , by the specified date, compliance with all issues identified after a compliance check . The Charter Holder failed, on several occasions, to timely submit documentation required to demonstrate compliance with a number of operational issues. The Charter Holder was notified on April 26, 2019 of its required submissions to demonstrate compliance following a site visit conducted March 27 , 2019. The Charter Holder was given a deadline of May 27 , 2019 to submit documentation of compliance . The Charter Holder did not submit all of the required documentation by the specified deadline. The Charter Holder's failure to timely submit resulted in a rating of \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the Operational Performance Framework measure that determin es whether a charter holder is complying with its obligations to the Board. Subsequently, the Charter Holder was given a final deadline of June 19 , 2019 to submit documentation . The Charter Holder did not submit all of the required documentation by the spe cified deadline. See Appendix D : 30 Day Failure to Submit for more detail. 6 ASBCS, September 9, 2019 The Charter Holder's failure to timely submit resulted in a second mark under the Operational Performance Framework measure that determines whether a charter holder is complying with its obligations to the Board. On June 24 , 2019, a last notification was sent to the Charter Holder outlining the remaining issues and the required documentation. See Appendix E : 7 Day Failure to Submit for more detail. On July 29 , 2019, the Charter Holder submitted documentation that demonstrated current compliance with issues identified at the site visit. 2.e. Favorable Board Actions \u2014F-School Consent Agreement Pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -241.02(I) and A.A.C. R7 -5-602, w hen a charter school is assigned a letter grade of F, the Board is required to either take action to revoke the charter school's charter or restore the charter school to acceptable performance through a consent agreement. On October 5, 2018, the Board was notified by ADE that the School was assigned a letter grade of \"F\" for FY 2018 . At the November 13, 2018 Board meeting, the Board approved an updated consent agreement to accommodate schools assigned a l etter grade of \"F\" in FY 2018. On March 19, 2019, the Board approved and executed the consent agreement with the Charter Holder . The Charter Holder's failure to meet the Board's established academic performance expectations was rated \"Does Not Meet Standard\" for the O perational Performance F ramework measure that determines a charter holder complies with its obligations to the Board. 3. Other Obligations \u2014Teacher Salary Posting Pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 15 -189.05, each charter school is required to prominently post teacher salary information on its website homepage. During a review conducted before the school site visit, Board staff found that the Charter Holder's website did not have the required teacher salary posting .
