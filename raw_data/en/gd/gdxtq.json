Previous failed vaccine efforts targeted HSV which elicits only neutralizing antibodies. M.D.](/faculty/10991/betsy-herold/), and colleagues have developed a promising \"non-gD\" candidate vaccine that elicits antibodies that generate antibody-dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The NIH has awarded the researchers a five-year, $3 million grant to isolate and characterize these ADCC-mediating mAbs, individually and in combination, in mouse models of HSV infection; determine how deletion of gD allows for the generation of ADCC; and study interactions between gD and the immunomodulatory molecule herpes entry mediator (HVEM), which is expressed by most immune cells. The findings will have implications for designing vaccines and mAbs against other pathogens and cancer. Dr. Herold is professor of [pediatrics](/departments/pediatrics/), of [microbiology & immunology](/departments/microbiology-immunology/), and holds the Harold and Muriel Block Chair in Pediatrics at Einstein and is vice chair for research and chief of infectious diseases at Einstein and the [Children's Hospital at Montefiore](https://www.cham.org/).
