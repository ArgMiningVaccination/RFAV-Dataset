On this page, we share a list of NCI-designated centers and the integrative programs and offerings listed on their websites. This is not a comprehensive list of all clinics or centers that offer integrative cancer care. Many additional cancer centers beyond NCI-designated centers, plus independent programs and clinics, are available. See Finding Integrative Oncologists and Other Professionals for directories of practitioners across the spectrum of integrative professionals. Some points to consider as you search for a cancer center: - Some major cancer centers with integrative medicine programs are not specifically integrative oncology programs. - An integrative medicine program does not always mean integrative medicine providers and conventional care providers collaborate. - Integrative oncology services may range from limited to extensive. Key questions to ask: - Does the center have an integrative medicine program for people with cancer? - What specific services are offered? - What kinds of practitioners/physicians are providing direct complementaryin cancer care, complementary care involves the use of therapies intended to enhance or add to standard conventional treatments; examples include supplements, mind-body approaches such as yoga or psychosocial therapy, and acupuncture medicine services? - What is the cost of services? Which services will insurance cover? Information about cancer centers was last updated in October 2019.
