Helpful Information Possible Side Effects After Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you from getting COVID-19. You may have some side effects, which are normal signs that your body is building protection. These side effects may affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects. Common Side Effects On the arm where you got the shot: - Pain - Redness - Swelling Throughout the rest of your body: - Tiredness - Headache - Muscle pain - Chills - Fever - Nausea Helpful Tips to Relieve Side Effects Talk to your doctor about taking over-the-counter medicine, such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin, or antihistamines, for any pain and discomfort you may experience after getting vaccinated. You can take these medications to relieve post-vaccination side effects if you have no other medical reasons that prevent you from taking these medications normally. It is not recommended you take these medicines before vaccination for the purpose of trying to prevent side effects. To reduce pain and discomfort where you got the shot - Apply a clean, cool, wet washcloth over the area. - Use or exercise your arm. To reduce discomfort from fever - Drink plenty of fluids. - Dress lightly. If You Received a Second Shot Side effects after your second shot may be more intense than the ones you experienced after your first shot. These side effects are normal signs that your body is building protection and should go away within a few days. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine both need 2 shots in order to get the most protection. You should get the second shot even if you have side effects after the first shot, unless a vaccination provider or your doctor tells you not to get it. You only need 1 shot of the Johnson & Johnson's Janssen (J&J/Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine to get the most protection. When to Call the Doctor In most cases, discomfort from pain or fever is a normal sign that your body is building protection. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider: - If the redness or tenderness where you got the shot gets worse after 24 hours - If your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you think you might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the vaccination site, seek immediate medical care by calling 911. - Emergency Care - Cape Coral Hospital 636 Del Prado Blvd Cape Coral, FL 33990 - Emergency Care - Coconut Point 23450 Via Coconut Pt Estero, FL 33928 - Trauma & Emergency Center - Gulf Coast Medical Center 13681 Doctors Way Fort Myers, FL 33912 - Emergency Care - HealthPark Medical Center 9981 S HealthPark Dr Fort Myers, FL 33908 - Emergency Care - Lee Memorial Hospital 2780 Cleveland Ave, Suite "}
