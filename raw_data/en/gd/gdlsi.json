[7500] CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2016 6 SECTION II: PROGRAM 'S PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT AND PROGRESS This section consists of two subsections that gather information about the CHIP and/or Medicaid program. Section II A captures your enrollment progress as well as changes in the number and/or rate of uninsured children in your s tate. Section II B captures progress towards meeting your s tate's general strategic objectives and performance goals. SECTION IIA: ENROLLMENT AND UNINSURED DATA 1. The information in the table below is the Unduplicated Number of Children Ever Enrolled in CHIP in your state for the two most recent reporting periods. The enrollment numbers reported below should correspond to line 7 (Unduplicated # Ever Enrolled Year) in your state's 4th quarter data report (submitted in October) in the CHIP Statistical Enrollment Data System (SEDS). The percent change column reflects the percent change in enrollment over the two- year period. If the percent change exceeds 10 percent (increase or decreas e), please explain in letter A below any factors that may account for these changes (such as decreases due to elimination of outreach or increases due to program expansions). This information will be filled in automatically by CARTS through a link to SEDS . Please wait until you have an enrollment number from SEDS before you complete this response. Program FFY 2015 FFY 2016 Percent change FFY 2015 -2016 CHIP Medicaid Expansion Program 17971 17965 -0.03 Separate Child Health Program 88244 90050 2.05 A. Please explain any factors that may account for enrollment increases or decreases exceeding 10 percent. [7500] N/A - Decrease of CHIP Medicaid Expansion and decrease of Separate Child Health program are each less than 10 percent. Children under age 19 w ho are losing eligibility for Medicaid and who have a medical condition that makes them effectively uninsurable. 2. The tables below show trends in the number and rate of uninsured children in your state. Three year averages in Table 1 are based on the Current Population Survey. The single year estimates in Table 2 are based on the American Community Survey (ACS). CARTS will fill in this information automatically , and significant changes are denoted with an asterisk (*). If your state uses an alternate data source and/or methodology for measuring change in the number and/or rate of uninsured children, please explain in Question #3. Table 1: Number and percent of uninsured children under age 19 below 200 percent of poverty, Current Population Survey Uninsured Children Under Age 19 Below 200 Percent of Poverty Uninsured Children Under Age 19 Below 200 Percent of Poverty as a Percent of Total Children Under Age 19 Period Number Std.

Please explain any activities or factors that may account for increases or decreases in your number and/or rate of uninsured children. [7500] Tennessee's economy is continuing to recover, with unemployment decreasing to 4.8 percent as of November 2016. This has likely contributed to the decrease in the percentage of uninsured CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2016 8 children observed over the last few years. While the recovery continues, there are still a number of Tennessee families who lack access to employer -sponsored insurance or who may be unable to afford the insurance offered by their employer. B. Please note any comments here concerning ACS data limitations that may affect the reliability or precision of these estimates. [7500] The ACS data may not lag as much the actual number of uninsured children in the state. 3. Please indicate by checking the box below whether your state has an alternate data source and/or methodology for measuring the change in the number and/or rate of uninsured children. Yes (please report your data in the table below) No (skip the rest of the question) Please report your alternate data in the table below. Data are required for two or more points in time to demonstrate change (or lack of change). Please be as specific and detailed as possible about the method used to measure progress toward covering the uninsured.

[7500] CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2016 9 SECTION IIB: STATE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES AND PERFORMANCE GOALS This subsection gathers information on your s tate's general strategic objectives, performance goals, performance measures and progress towards meeting goals, as specified in your CHIP s tate plan. (If your goals reported in the annual report now differ from Section 9 of your CHIP state plan, please indicate how they differ in \"Other Comments on Measure.\" Also, the state plan should be amended to reconcile these differences). The format of this section provides your s tate with an opportunity to track progress over time. This section contains templates for reporting performance measurement data for each of five categories of strategic objectives, related to: Reducing the number of uninsur ed children CHIP enrollment Medicaid enrollment Increasing access to care Use of preventative care (immunizations, well child care) Please report performance measurement data for the three most recent years for which data are available (to the extent that data are available). In the first two columns, data from the previous two years' annual reports (FFY 2014 and FFY 2015) will be populated with data from previously reported data in CARTS. If you reported data in the two previous years ' reports and you want to update/change the data, please enter that data. If you reported no data for either of those two years, but you now have data available for them, please enter the data. In the third column, please report the most recent data available at the time you are submitting the current annual report (FFY 2016). In this section, the term performance measure is used to refer to any data your s tate provides as evidence towards a particular goal within a strategic objective. For the purpose of this section, \"objectives\" refer to the five broad categories listed above, while \"goals\" are s tate-specific, and should be listed in the appropriate subsections within the space provided for each objective. NOTES: Please do not reference attachments in this section. If details about a particular measure are located in an attachment, please summarize the relevant information from the attachment in the space provided for each measure. In addition, please do not report the same data that were reported for Child Core Set reporting . The intent of this section is to capture goals and measures that your s tate did not report elsewhere. As a reminder, Child Core Set reporting migrated to MACPR O in December 2015. Historical data are still available for viewing in CARTS. Additional instructions for completing each row of the table are provided below. Goal: For each objective, space has been provided to report up to three goals. Use this secti on to provide a brief description of each goal you are reporting within a given strategic objective . All new goals should include a direction and a target. For clarification only, an example goal would be : \"Increase (direction) by 5 percent (target) the number of CHIP beneficiaries who turned 13 years old during the measurement year who had a second dose of MMR, three hepatitis B vaccinations and one varicella vaccination by their 13th birthday.\" Type of Goal: For each goal you are reporting within a given strategic objective, please indicate the type of goal, as follows: New/revised: Check this box if you have revised or added a goal. Please explain how and why the goal was revised. CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2016 10 Continuing: Check this box if the goal you are reporting is the same one you have reported in previous annual reports. Discontinued: Check this box if you have met your goal and/or are discontinuing a goal. Please explain why the goal was discontinued. Status of Data Reported: Please indicate the status of the data you are reporting for each goal, as follows: Provisional : Check this box if you are reporting performance measure data for a goal, but the data are currently being modified, verified, or may change in any other way before you finalize them for FFY 2016. Explanation of Provisional Data - When the value of the Status of Data Reported field is selected as \"Provisional\", the state must specify why the data are provisional and when the state expects the data will be final. Final : Check this box if the data you are reporting are considered final for FFY 2016. Same data as reported in a previous year's annual report : Check this box if the data you are reporting are the same data that your state reported for the goal in another annual report. Indicate in which year's annual report you previously reported the data. Measurement Specification: This section is included for only two of the objectives \u2014 objectives related to increasing access to care, and objectives related to use of preventative care\u2014 because these are the two objectives for which states may report using the HEDIS\u00ae measurement speci fication. In this section, for each goal, please indicate the measurement specification used to calculate your performance measure data (i.e., were the measures calculated using the HEDIS\u00ae specifications or some other method unrelated to HEDIS\u00ae). Please indicate whether the measure is based on HEDIS\u00ae technical specifications or another source. If HEDIS\u00ae is selected, the HEDIS\u00ae Version field must be completed. If \"Other\" measurement specification is selected, the explanation field must be completed. HEDIS\u00ae Version: Please s pecify HEDIS\u00ae Version (example 2015). This field must be completed only when a user select the HEDIS\u00ae measurement specification. \"Other\" measurement specification explanation: If \"Other\", measurement specification is selected, please complete the explanation of the \"Other\" measurement specification. The explanation field must be completed when \"Other\" measurement specification has been selected. Data Source: For each performance measure, please indicate the source of data. The categories provided in this section vary by objective. For the objectives related to reducing the number of uninsured children and CHIP or Medicaid enrollment, please indicate whether you have used elig ibility/enrollment data, survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (specify the other source). For the objectives related to access to care and use of preventative care, please indicate whether you used administrative data (claims) (specify t he kind of administrative data used), hybrid data (claims and medical records) (specify how the two were used to create the data source), survey data (specify the survey used), or other source (specify the other source). In all cases, if another data sour ce was used, please explain the source. Definition of Population Included in Measure: CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2016 11 Numerator: Please indicate the definition of the population included in the numerator for each measure (such as the number of visits required for inclusion, e.g., one or more visits in the past year). Denominator: Please indicate the definition of the population included in the denominator for each measure. For measures related to increasing access to care and use of preventative care, please check one box to indicate whether the data are for the CHIP population only, or include both CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) children combined. Check one box to indicate whether the data are for the CHIP population only, or include both CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) children combined. If the denominator reported is not fully representative of the population defined above (the CHIP population only , or the CHIP and Medicaid (Title XIX) populations combined), please further define the denominator. For example, denominator includes only children enrolled in managed care in certain counties, technological limitations preventing reporting on the full population defined, etc.). Please report information on exclusions in the def inition of the denominator (including the proportion of children excluded), The provision of this information is important and will provide CMS with a context so that comparability of denominators across the s tates and over time can occur. Deviations from Measure Specification For the measures related to increasing access to care and use of preventative care. If the data provided for a measure deviates from the measure specification, please select the type(s) of measure specification deviation. The types of deviation parallel the measure specification categories for each measure. Each type of deviation is accom panied by a comment field that s tates must use to explain in greater detail or further specify the deviation when a deviation(s) from a measure is selected.. The five types (and examples) of deviations are: Year of Data (e.g., partial year), Data Source (e.g., use of different data sources among health plans or delivery systems), Numerator (e.g., coding issues), Denominator (e.g., exclusion of MCOs, different age groups, definition of continuous enrollment), Other. When one or more of the types are selected, states are required to provide an explanation. Please report the year of data for each performance measure. The year (or months) should correspond to the period in which enrollment or utilization took place. Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may be different from the period corresponding to enrollment or utilization of services. Date Range: available for 2016 CARTS reporting period. Please define the date range for the reporting period based on the \"From\" time period as the month and year which corresponds to the beginning period in which utilization took place and please report the \" To\" time period as the month and year which corresponds to the end period in which utilization took place. Do not report the year in which data were collected for the measure, or the version of HEDIS\u00ae used to calculate the measure, both of which may be dif ferent from the period corresponding to utilization of services. Performance Measurement Data (HEDIS\u00ae or Other): In this section, please report the numerators and denominators, rates for each measure (or component). The template provides two sections for entering the performance measurement data, depending on whether you are reporting using HEDIS\u00ae or other methodologies. The form fields have been set up to CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2016 12 facilitate entering numerators and denominators for each measure. If the form fields do not give y ou enough space to fully report on the measure, please use the \"additional notes\" section. The preferred method is to calculate a \"weighted rate\" by summing the numerators and denominators across plans, and then deriving a single state- level rate based on the ratio of the numerator to the denominator). The reporting unit for each measure is the s tate as a whole. If states calculate rates for multiple reporting units (e.g., individual health plans, different health care delivery systems), States must aggregate data from all these sources into one State rate before reporting the data to CMS. In the situation where a state combines data across multiple reporting units, all or some of which use the hybrid method to calculate the rates , the s tate should ent er zeroes in the \"Numerator\" and \"Denominator\" fields. In these cases, it should report the s tate-level rate in the \"Rate\" field and, when possible, include individual reporting unit numerators, denominators, and rates in the field labeled \"Additional Notes on Measure,\" along with a description of the method used to derive the s tate-level rate. Explanation of Progress: The intent of this section is to allow your s tate to highlight progress and describe any quality -improvement activities that may have contributed to your progress. Any quality -improvement activity described should involve the CHIP program, benefit CHIP enrollees, and relate to the performance measur e and your progress. An example of a quality -improvement activity is a state- wide initiative to inform individual families directly of their children's immunization status with the goal of increasing immunization rates. CHIP would either be the primary l ead or substantially involved in the project. If improvement has not occurred over time, this section can be used to discuss potential reasons for why progress was not seen and to describe future quality -improvement plans. In this section, your state is a lso asked to set annual performance objectives for FFY 2017 , 2018 and 2019. Based on your recent performance on the measure (from FFY 2014 through 2016), use a combination of expert opinion and \"best guesses\" to set objectives for the next three years. P lease explain your rationale for setting these objectives. For example, if your rate has been increasing by 3 or 4 percentage points per year, you might project future increases at a similar rate. On the other hand, if your rate has been stable over time, you might set a target that projects a small increase over time. If the rate has been fluctuating over time, you might look more closely at the data to ensure that the fluctuations are not an artifact of the data or the methods used to construct a rate. You might set an initial target that is an average of the recent rates, with slight increases in subsequent years. In future annual reports, you will be asked to comment on how your actual performance compares to the objective your s tate set for the year , as well as any quality -improvement activities that have helped or could help your s tate meet future objectives. Other Comments on Measure: Please use this section to provide any other comments on the measure, such as data limitations, plans to report on a measure in the future, or differences between performance measures reported here and those discussed in Section 9 of the CHIP state plan.

What other strategies does your state use to measure and report on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? What have you found? [7500] CoverKids also uses additional HEDIS measures as well as NCQA standards to measure, monitor, and assure that quality standards are maintained. We have found that additional outreach and specific targeted interventions are necessary to improve outcomes for the CHIP population. 2. What strategies does your CHIP program have for future m easurement and reporting on access to, quality, or outcomes of care received by your CHIP population? When will data be available? [7500] For future measurement years, we will continue collect HEDIS data using hybrid methodology for the seven HEDIS measures that were collected using hybrid methodology beginning with measurement year 2012. These include: Well -Child Visits in the First 15 Months of Life; Well -Child Visits in the Third, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Years of Life; Childhood Immunization Status; Im munizations for Adolescents; Adolescent Well- Care; Weight Assessment and Counseling for Nutrition and Physical Activity for Children/Adolescents; Prenatal and Postpartum Care. 3. Have you conducted any focused quality studies on your CHIP population, e. g., adolescents, attention deficit disorder, substance abuse, special heath care needs or other emerging health care needs? What have you found? [7500] Focused studies include weekly reports on Attention Deficit Disorder which is used for telephonic outreach as well as a proactive report for Childhood and Adolescent Immunizations identifying members with immunization gaps 3 months prior to their 2nd and 13th birthday for telephonic outreach. A proactive report for well child visits and adolescent well car e visits identifying members with a gap 3 months prior to their birthday was implemented in 2015 for telephonic outreach. We have found that additional outreach and specific targeted interventions have been successful in improved outcomes for the CHIP population. 4. Please attach any additional studies, analyses or other documents addressing outreach, enrollment, access, quality, utilization, costs, satisfaction, or other aspects of your CHIP program's performance. Please include any analyses or descripti ons of any efforts designed to reduce the number of uncovered children in the state through a state health insurance connector program or support for innovative private health coverage initiatives health coverage initiatives. [7500] The attached report (C overKids Preventative and Wellness Executive Summary - 3rd Quarter) is a quarterly report used to analyze all areas related to CoverKids Health outcomes. This report has been developed to provide management level committees results on interventions and out reach efforts. Enter any Narrative text related to Section IIB below [7500] . CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2016 51 SECTION III: ASSESSMENT OF STATE PLAN AND PROGRAM OPERATION Please reference and summarize attachments that are relevant to specific questions A. OUTREACH 1. How have you redirected/changed your outreach strategies during the reporting period? [7500] We continue to maintain many of the same strategies for outreach to our CoverKids population. We rely on our partners in the community including the Managed C are Organizations to provide routine communications to members such as newsletters and outreach during noted gaps in care just to name a few. We continue to utilization the annual back -to-school mailing as our primary outreach activity. 2. What methods have you found most effective in reaching low -income, uninsured children (e.g., T.V., school outreach, word- of-mouth)? How have you measured effectiveness? [7500] As previously mentioned we continued our annual back -to-school mailing in 2016 provi ding information on the CoverKids program to all public schools across the state of Tennessee. Approximately one million fliers were mailed to schools with instructions to provide the information to students and/or parents. The fliers included information on the importance of health insurance, how to apply and the need for routine checkups and dental visits. The fliers were printed in English and Spanish. In addition to the mailing outreach we continue to provide information through the kidcentral tn we bsite. This website is supported by the Tennessee Children's Cabinet and provides information on services and programs available to citizens in the state including CoverKids. We are able to measure the effectiveness of these efforts by tracking visits to certain websites which are CoverKids specific as well as tracking any growth in enrollment in the months following the annual back -to- school mailing. 3. Which of the methods described in Question 2 would you consider a best practice(s) ? [7500] The annual back -to-school mailing is a best practice for our program. We have been successful in carrying out this effort for nearly a decade and with great success. We continue to identify new opportunities to partner with our stakeholders and health plans but the mailing is cost -effective and easily maintained and executed. 4. Is your state targeting outreach to specific populations (e.g., minorities, immigrants, and children living in rural areas)? Yes No Have these efforts been successful, and how have you measured effectiveness? [7500] With our back -to-school mailing, we send information to all public schools across the state of Tennessee. We mailed fliers to more than 1700 schools reaching both rural and urban areas in Tennessee. As previously mentioned the flier is printed in both English and Spanish. Information is provided in the flier on how to receive additional langu age services such as translation and/or interpretation services. We measure the effectiveness of the outreach efforts by any changes in enrollment. We attribute any enrollment growth in the days and months following the mailing as a positive correlation to the information shared within the communities across the state. 5. What percentage of children below 200 percent of the Federal poverty level (FPL) who are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP have been enrolled in those programs? [5] (Identify the data source used). [7500] Based on monthly enrollment reports from the health plan that administers the CoverKids program, enrollment based on FPL is broken down into two groups. Group One is members who are between 205% and 255% FPL. The percentage of CoverKids members in that group is approximately 14.55 percent based on enrollment figures through the end of September 2015. Group Two is members who are less than 204 percent FPL which represents approximately 85.45 percent. For the CoverKids \"unbor n\" program approximately 7.73 percent is between 205% and 255% FPL compared CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2016 52 to 92.7 percent which are below 205% percent based on enrollment through the end of September 2016.

If relevant, please describe any limitations or restrictions on the data entered into this table. Please describe any s tate policies or procedures that may have impacted the redetermination outcomes data. Definitions: 1. The \"total number of children who are eligible to be redetermined\" is defined as the total number of children due to renew their eligibility in federal fiscal year (FFY) 2016, and did not age out (did not exceed the program's maximum age requirement) of the program by or before redetermination. This total number may include those children who are eligible to renew prior to their 12 month eligibility redetermination anniversary date. This total must include ex parte redeterminations, the process when a s tate uses information available to it through other databases, such as wage and labor records, to verify ongoing eligibility. This total number must also include children whose eligibility can be renewed through administrative redeterminations, CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2016 58 whereby the s tate sends the family a renewal form that is pre -populated with eligibility information already available through program records and requires the fami ly to report any changes. 2. The \"total number of children screened for redetermination\" is defined as the total number of children that were screened by the state for redetermination in FFY 2016 (i.e., ex parte redeterminations and administrative redeterminations, as well as those children whose families have returned redetermination forms to the state ). 3. The \"total number of children retained after the redetermination process\" is defined as the total number of children who were found eligible and rem ained in the program after the redetermination process in FFY 2016. 4. The \"total number of children disenrolled from title X IX after the redetermination process\" is defined as the total number of children who are disenrolled from title X IX following the r edetermination process in FFY 2016. This includes those children that states may define as \"transferred\" to CHIP for title XXI eligibility screening. a. The \"total number of children disenrolled for failure to comply with procedures\" is defined as the total number of children disenrolled from title X IX for failure to successfully complete the redetermination process in FFY 2016 (i.e., families that failed to submit a complete application, failed to provide complete documentation, failed to pay premium or enrollment fee, etc.). b. The \"total number of children disenrolled for failure to meet eligibility criteria\" is defined as the total number of children disenrolled from title X IX for no longer meeting one or more of their state's Medicaid eligibility c riteria ( i.e., income too high, etc.). c. The \"total number of children disenrolled for other reason(s)\" is defined as the total number of children disenrolled from title X IX for a reason other than failure to comply with procedures or failure to meet eligibility criteria, and are not already captured in 4.a. or 4.b. The data entered in 4.a., 4.b., and 4.c. should sum to the total number of children disenrolled from title XIX (line 4). CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2016 59 Table 3. Duration Measure of Selected Children, Ages 0- 16, Enrolled in Title XIX and Title XXI, Second Quarter FFY 2016 The purpose of tables 3a and 3b is to measure the duration, or continuity, of Medicaid and CHIP enrollees' coverage. This information is required by Section 402(a) of CHIPRA. Reporting on this table is required . Because the measure is designed to capture continuity of coverage in ti tle XIX and title XXI beyond one year of enrollment, the measure collects data for 18 months of enrollment. This means that reporting spans two CARTS reports over two years. The duration measure uses a cohort of children and follows the enrollment of the same cohort of children for 18 months to measure continuity of coverage. States identify a new cohort of children every two years. States identified newly enrolled children in the second quarter of FFY 2016 (January, February, and March of 2016) for the FFY 2016 CARTS report . If your eligibility system already has the capability to track a cohort of enrollees over time, an additional \"flag\" or uniqu e identifier may not be necessary. The FFY 2016 CARTS report is the first year of reporting in the cyc le of two CARTS reports on the cohort of children identified in the second quarter of FFY 2016. States will continue to report on the same table in the FFY 2017 CARTS reports. The next cohort of children will be identified in the second quarter of the FFY 2018 (January, February and March 2018). Instructions: For this measure, please identify newly enrolled children in both title XIX and title XXI in the second quarter of FFY 2016, ages 0 months to 16 years at time of enrollment. Children enrolled in January 2016 must have birthdates after July 1999 (e.g., children must be younger than 16 years and 5 months) to ensure that they will not age out of the program at the 18th month of c overage. Similarly, children enrolled in February 2016 must have birthdates after August 1999, and children enrolled in March 2016 must have birthdates after September 1999. Each child newly enrolled during this time frame needs a unique identifier or \"f lag\" so that the cohort can be tracked over time. If your eligibility system already has the capability to track a cohort of enrollees over time, an additional \"flag\" or unique identifier may not be necessary. Please follow the child based on the child's age category at the time of enrollment (e.g., the child's age at enrollment creates an age cohort that does not change over the 18 month time span). Please enter the data requested in the tables below , and the template will tabulate the percentages . In this report you will only enter data on the 6- month enrollment status. Only enter a \"0\" (zero) if the data are known to be zero . If data are unknown or unavailable, leave the field blank. Note that all data must sum correctly in order to save and mo ve to the next page. The data in each individual row must add across to sum to the total in the \"All Children Ages 0- 16\" column for that row. And in each column, the data within each time period (6, 12 and 18 months) must each sum up to the data in row 1 , which is the number of children in the cohort. This means that in each column, rows 2, 3 and 4 must sum to the total in ro w 1; rows 5, 6 and 7 must sum to the row 1; and rows 8, 9 and 10 must sum to row 1. Rows numbered with an \"a\" ( e.g., rows 3a and 4a ) are excluded from the total because they are subsets of their respective rows. CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2016 60 Table 3a .

[7500] H. CHIPRA CAHPS REQUIREMENT CHIPRA section 402(a)(2), which amends reporting requirements in section 2108 of the Social Securit y Act, requires Title XXI Programs (i.e., CHIP Medicaid expansion programs, separate child health programs, or a combination of the two) to report CAHPS results to CMS starting December 2013. While Title XXI Programs may select any CAHPS survey to fulfil l this requirement, CMS encourages these programs to align with the CAHPS measure in the Children's Core Set of Health Care Quality Measures for Medicaid and CHIP (Child Core Set) . Starting in 2013, Title XXI Programs should submit summary level information from the CAHPS survey to CMS via the CARTS attachment facility. We also encourage states to submit raw data to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's CAHPS Database. More information is available in the Technical Assistance fact sheet, Collecting and Reporting the CAHPS Survey as Required Under the CHIPRA: http://www.medicaid.gov/Medicaid- CHIP -Program - Information/By -Topics/Quality -of-Care/Downloads/CAHPSFactSheet.pdf . If a state would like to provide CAHPS data on both Medicaid and CHIP enrollees, the agency must sample Title XIX (Medicaid) and Title XXI (CHIP) programs separately and submit separate results to CMS to fulfill the CHIPRA Requirement.

[7500] The CoverKids program medical and pharmacy benefits are self -funded, with the exception of dental care which remains fully insured. A 3.2% rate increase FFS increase went into affect 1/1/2016 for CoverKids providers. Medical benefits were expanded for pregnant women and copays were reduced for all members during FY 2016. Other Administrative costs reflect a state assessed MCO premium tax effective January 1, 2016 going forward. CoverKids Personnel moved to TennCare and a portion of salaries are directed to general overhead costs through cost allocation. CHIP Annual Report Template - FFY 2016 82 SECTION V: PROGRAM CHALLENGES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS 1. For the reporting period, please provide an overview of your state's political and fiscal environment as it relates to health care for low income, uninsured children and families, and how this environment impacted CHIP. [7500] As of December 16, 2015, non- pregnant applicants continue to apply for coverage through the Marketplace. Deloitte was awarded the Systems Integration contract for the State of Tennessee. Deloitte will build the new Medicaid and CHIP eligibility and determination system. 2. During t he reporting period, what has been the greatest challenge your program has experienced? [7500] As noted above, the development of the state's new eligibility determination system continues to be a major challenge. We continue to operate under a federally -approved mitigation plan as systems development work continues. In the interim, the FFM remains the primary point of entry for most CHIP applicants in Tennessee. 3. During the reporting period, what accomplishments have been achieved in your program? [7500] CoverKids enrollment has been steady around 70,000 for the last couple of years. We continue to enroll uninsured Tennesseans, children no long eligible for Medicaid coverage or children whose parents cannot afford employer -sponsored insurance. We continue to work on aligning the separate CHIP program benefits with the Medicaid program and member material. As part of this alignment effort, in 2016 we made changes to the coverage available to \"unborn\" enrollees to more closely mirror the coverage available to pregnant women in Tennessee's Medicaid program. 4. What changes have you made or are planning to make in your CHIP program during the next fiscal year? Please comment on why the changes are planned. [7500] We will continue to work on aligning the separat e CHIP program to mirror the Medicaid program, such as enhance the Behavioral Health benefits and Quality management. Tennessee plans to implement our new Eligibility and Determination system next year where Medicaid and CHIP enrollment will be housed in one system. This will be a great accomplishment for the state to implement a seamless process for our beneficiaries, enrollees and applicants and become an Assessment state.
