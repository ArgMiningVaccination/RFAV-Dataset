Hargreave, MB ChB, MD, FRCP, FRCPC Emeritus Professor of Medicine, McMaster UniversityFrederick E. Hargreave 22 November 1938 - 15 June 2011 Freddy Hargreave joined McMaster University in 1969 in the early days of the Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine after his medical training at the University of Leeds and research training with Professor Jack Pepys at the Brompton Hospital in London where he described a new clinical entity called 'Bird Fancier's Lung'. At McMaster University, along with his close friend and colleague Professor Jerry Dolovich, his studies in asthma changed the way the disease is diagnosed. He developed innovative tests to measure airway responsiveness and airway inflammation and make decisions on clinical treatments. Professor Hargreave changed the focus from just treating asthma symptoms to preventing and controlling them. He was known as an excellent teacher, and he trained many of the world's current leaders in asthma research. Most importantly, he cared for his patients in an exemplary manner with unfailing courtesy, dedication, humility and kindness. He constantly endeavored to bring the health challenges his patients faced every day to the research community in order to find better ways to improve the quality of their lives. 13:00 - 14:00 POSTER SESSION 2 HALL 4 For full details of the below Poster Sessions, please view the \"Poster\" section of this Final Program.
