Dean of Women General Information 45 building are rich in ornament. Mr. and Mrs. Billings gave one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars as an endowment fund for the building. The Library contains over one hundred and forty-seven thousand volumes and forty-five thousand pamphlets and is the largest collection of books in the State. It has a classified shelf arrangement, dictionary catalogue, special bibliographies and other modern facilities and aids for convenient use. The shelves are accessible to readers, except in the special collections. All the leading periodicals, including many foreign ones, and the most important transactions of learned societies are received currently. All the administration is directed toward making the Library the active center of the intellectual life of the University and an auxiliary to every teaching department. Attention is given to directing the students how to use the catalogues, reference books and special bibliographies, and in general research work. Books selected by professors for supplemental reading in connection with class work are \"reserved\" on special shelves for students in those classes. The Library is open from 8.15 in the morning to 9 in the evening and from 2 to 6 on Sunday afternoons in term time, with shorter hours during vacations. The privileges of the Library are granted freely to those not connected with the University and books are loaned frequently to high schools and to persons living at a distance. The students also have the use of the Fletcher Free Library of the city, a collection of about sixty thousand volumes of such selection and so liberally administered as very helpfully to supplement the University Library. Among the special collections of the Billings Library is the private collection of George Perkins Marsh, former resident of Burlington, author, scholar, and United States Minister, first to Turkey and later to Italy. This comprises twelve thousand eight hundred and eighty-two volumes and is especially rich in philology, European history and literature, and physical geography. The collection is contained in a handsome room built in 1887 especially to receive it. The Hawkins Collection, given to the University by the late Gen. Rush C. Hawkins, is also a notable one, containing several thousand books and pamphlets relating to the Civil War period. This collection has been greatly augmented by the gift of Gen. O. O. Howard's valuable military library, the gift of his son, Harry S. Howard. The Library is also in possession of an interesting collection of rare and valuable early books, first editions, manuscripts, and autographs. On the walls of the Library hang portraits of Ira Allen, the founder of the University; Frederick Billings, the donor of the building; several of the Presidents and others intimately associated with the life of the institution. 46 University of Vermont Supplementing the extensive collection of the works of Vermont authors, books descriptive of Vermont and those with Vermont imprints which are in the Billings Library, the University has received and cata\u00ad logued the valuable Vermont library of the late James B. Wilbur. The books, pamphlets, maps, manuscripts and photostats in this collection are deposited in the Wilbur Room of the Fleming Museum. Gifts for the Vermont collection always are welcome. The Medical Library containing about ten thousand volumes is in the College of Medicine building. One hundred sixty current medical journals are on file and loose-leaf systems of medicine and surgery are kept up to date. This Library is open from 9 a.m. to S p.m., Saturdays 9 to 12 noon. It is open on Tuesdays and Fridays during the evening. The Agricultural Library is in Morrill Hall. It contains several thou\u00ad sand volumes and many thousand pamphlets and journals dealing with agriculture, horticulture and veterinary science. Departmental libraries are located in the offices of the station agronomist, animal husbandman, agricultural economist, botanist, chemist, regulatory chemist, horticul\u00ad turist, as well as in the Extension Service Buildings. In addition to the main collections of books in the Billings, Marsh, Wilbur, Agricultural and Medical Libraries there are departmental libra\u00ad ries in the Williams Science Hall, the Engineering Annex, and the Old College Building. THE FLEMING MUSEUM (Erected 1931) The Robert Hull Fleming Museum was made possible by the generosity of the late James B. Wilbur of Manchester, Vt., of Miss Katherine Wolcott of Chicago, 111., and of six other friends of the University. It is named in honor of Miss Wolcott's uncle, a graduate of the class of 1862. The architects were McKim, Mead and White of New York. The south wing of the building, known as the Wilbur Room, was built especially to receive the collection of books, documents and maps that were presented to the University by the late James B. Wilbur. Hie Fleming Room, adjoining the beautiful two-storied Entrance Hall, is given over to the treasures of art gathered by Mr. Fleming during many years of travel. The exhibition rooms in the Museum contain frequently changed col\u00ad lections in geology, mineralogy, paleontology, all branches of zoology, ethnology and archaeology, and early Vermont furniture, utensils and costumes. The bird room and Cannon Room are noteworthy. The art collections of the Museum consist of paintings, engravings and sculpture. They have recently been supplemented by many repro\u00ad ductions of paintings. The collections include one thousand photographs, General Information 47 prints and engravings representing nearly every school of art. The Carnegie Art Reference Set, a teaching collection of over two thousand books, photographs, textiles and prints, to which additions are frequently made, is an important part of the Art Library.

Students taking the latter curriculum may apply any scholarship credit to fees for vocal music. Contestants are judged especially on tone, accuracy of pitch, rhythm and interpretation. Stage deportment and diction are also considered. The conditions of these contests are controlled by the Music Department of the University. LITERARY SCHOLARSHIPS Ten scholarships are provided by the University for the encourage\u00ad ment of literary work in the schools of the State. Three scholarships of one hundred and fifty dollars each are offered for the best short stories, essays and poems in annual competition, three scholarships of one hundred dollars each for the second best in each class, and three scholarships of seventy-five dollars each for the third best in each class. There also is one scholarship, valued at one hundred dollars, for the best one-act play. The competition closes May 1. THE CLASSICAL SCHOLARSHIPS Five scholarships of two hundred dollars each are offered each year by the University to freshmen, not residents of Vermont, who have com\u00ad pleted four years of preparatory Latin with honor grades. Those ap\u00ad pointed will be expected to take courses in Greek and Latin in college. The scholarships will be renewed in succeeding years for students who maintain high standing and continue the study of classical languages. The awards are made by the Classical Department. CITIZENS MILITARY TRAINING CAMP SCHOLARSHIPS Four full scholarships of three hundred dollars each are offered each year by the University of Vermont to freshman students to be selected by the President of the University from those C. M. T. C. students at the C. M. T. Camps in New England, who, having submitted evidence of having fulfilled the University of Vermont entrance requirements and of being in need of financial assistance in order to attend college, General Information 81 DEGREES Degrees are conferred upon the recommendation of the different Col\u00ad leges as follows: COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES CLASSICAL CURRICULUM; Bachelor of Arts, (A.B.)

The degrees of Master of Arts and Master of Science may be earned after attendance in regular or summer sessions. Technical Degrees, awarded only to graduates of the College of Engineer\u00ad ing of this University, require evidence of high professional achievement for at least four years supplemented by an approved thesis. GRADUATE FELLOWSHIPS AND SCHOLARSHIPS For the purposes of assisting students whose undergraduate record and personal qualities give promise of success, either in research or in the profession of teaching, the University has established a number of fellow\u00ad ships and scholarships. UNIVERSITY FELLOWSHIPS.\u2014Seven fellowships of seven hundred dollars each the first year, and eight hundred dollars each the second year, with exemption from tuition charges, are awarded to students whose under\u00ad graduate record and personal qualities give promise of success either in research or in the profession of teaching. The fee for the degree is charged. The holder of a fellowship is expected to work for the Master's Degree, to study some special problem of research and to give a certain amount of assistance to the department in which he holds the fellowship. The maximum amount of time devoted to this assistance, however, does not exceed eight hours per week. These Fellows are subject to such general rules as are in effect for those who are doing work for advanced degrees. In awarding three of these fellowships preference is given to applicants who are not graduates of the University of Vermont. EXPERIMENT STATION FELLOWSHIPS.\u2014A number of fellowships of nine hundred dollars each, with exemption from tuition charges, are awarded each year to full time research assistants in the Experiment Station who are working for the Master's Degree. All such awards are made on the recommendation of the Station Director. The fee for the degree is charged. THE GEORGE H. WALKER DAIRY FELLOWSHIP is a grant of not less than seven hundred dollars, with exemption from tuition charges, available to graduate students who during their undergraduate course have studied \"agriculture, chemistry and bacteriology\" and who desire to study the problems relating to the production of a sanitary milk supply on com\u00ad paratively small plants and farms. The endowment of ten thousand dollars is sufficient to provide biennially a fellowship for one year. General Information 83 THE SHEFFIELD FARMS DAIRY FELLOWSHIP is a grant of nine hundred dollars per year, with exemption from tuition charges. This fellowship is derived from a grant of one thousand dollars per year provided by The Sheffield Farms Company, Incorporated, and is available for 1939-1940 and 1940-1941. The purpose is to foster research in dairying for the benefit of producers. THE UNIVERSITY GRADUATE SCHOLARSHIPS provide full and partial tuition rebate for graduate students. Ten scholarships of three hundred dollars each are awarded annually to selected students enrolled in the Graduate Department. The partial scholarships are variable in number and amount and are budgeted annually. In awarding one-half of these scholarships preference will be given to applicants who are not graduates of the Uni\u00ad versity of Vermont. REGISTRATION FOR GRADUATE STUDY A graduate who holds a Bachelor's degree or its equivalent from an approved college or university may be admitted to graduate study and register for such graduate studies as he is prepared to take. It is understood that a candidate in Arts shall have taken the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Philosophy, and that a candidate in Science shall have taken the degree of Bachelor of Science. If any other sequence of degrees is proposed the candidate shall satisfy the Committee on Degrees of his ability to do the work outlined. The Bachelor's degree, in order to be accepted, must have been taken at an approved institution. New students must apply for admission to the chairman of the Com\u00ad mittee on Graduate Work. They must file with the committee an enroll\u00ad ment blank approved by the department in which the major is to be taken. The payment of the required fees at the Comptroller's office completes registration. Candidates must register not later than November 1 of the college year in which the degree is sought. Students in the Summer Session must enroll on the appointed day in each of at least three Summer Sessions. On account of the seminar nature of most of the work the number of candidates selected for each department must be limited. All inquiries concerning the special opportunities for research in each department will be referred to the head of that department, and only candidates who desire to work along lines in which the University offers exceptional advantages will be accepted. Tuition is three hundred dollars a year. One-half of this charge is payable in advance on the first of each semester. No laboratory fees are charged but charges will be assessed for breakage. The fee for the Master's degree is twenty-five dollars. 84 University of Vermont Time alone is a minor consideration in all graduate work. Experience has shown, however, that at least the equivalent of a year's work is neces\u00ad sary for a student to fulfill the scholastic requirements for a Master's degree. The degree of Master of Arts or of Master of Science may be con\u00ad ferred for research work in a chosen field upon graduates of this Univer\u00ad sity or of any other college or university of recognized standing, after one year's residence at this University. Research Fellows, because they assist in teaching, must be in residence during two full academic years. THE MASTER'S DEGREES IN COURSE As the requirements for the Master's degrees are based on the ability of the candidate to do original research in his chosen field the result of which must be presented in the form of a thesis, the work is distinctly individualistic and so-called graduate courses are not directly counted toward a degree. The instructor in charge may require such graduate and undergraduate courses as seem essential for a proper understanding of the problem dis\u00ad cussed in the thesis. Such preliminary work may prolong the time require\u00ad ment. A typical plan for graduate study is given below: 1. General readings. A course of general reading will be assigned by the committee, to be followed by a written report and examination. 2. The plan of major and minor study must be submitted and the appli\u00ad cation for candidacy formally presented to the Committee on Degrees not later than November 1 of the college year in which the degree is sought. 3. Each candidate is required to present a thesis upon some chosen topic within the major field of study which shall give the result of an inves\u00ad tigation undertaken since graduation and show evidence of capacity for independent research. The candidate also will be expected to pass an examination before the Committee on Degrees, designed to test the thoroughness of the work done and fitness for the degree. Examinations for the Master's degree are held in May. The thesis must be presented not later than May 1, and will be deposited, if approved, in the University Library. 4. A minor subject must be chosen in a field of study different from that of the major. This minor must be closely related to the work of the thesis. General Information 85 GRADUATE STUDY EST THE SUMMER SESSION The requirements for the degrees of Master of Arts and Master of Science earned by attendance in Summer Sessions are essentially the same as those stated above with such minor adjustments as seem necessary. Students of the Summer Session who desire to have their work count for credit toward an advanced degree should consult with the Director of the Summer Session regarding the selection of courses. Under his guidance a major and a related minor course of study should be chosen. It is desirable that students carry three courses each year while meeting the residence requirements. At least three summers before the candidate expects to complete his work, he should select a thesis topic in the chosen major field. This topic should be selected only after consultation with the supervising instructor and should be presented to the Committee on Degrees for approval. The outline, method and development of the thesis must be under the constant direction of the supervising instructor, assisted by the Committee on Degrees. A course of general readings will be assigned by the Committee on Degrees in addition to the work of the major and related minor, and a written report and an oral examination on the readings will be required. The Director of the Summer Session, subject to the approval of the University Committee on Degrees, will assign supervising instructors for all students who register for work toward an advanced degree. The supervising instructors will make sure that the work followed is of graduate grade and that emphasis is placed on the ability for research. An oral examination before the Committee on Degrees, covering the courses of study as well as the research method and the conclusions of the thesis, will be required. At least four Summer Sessions will be necessary to satisfy the time requirement of residence. THE MASTER OF EDUCATION DEGREE The Degree of Master of Education is offered to those Summer Session students who wish to specialize in Education. Candidates for this degree are required to submit a transcript of their undergraduate records before they are accepted for matriculation. If they have not had a sufficient number of courses in Psychology and Education they will be required to take additional courses of undergraduate grade in these fields. Their records as undergraduates must be of such a character as to indicate ability to do graduate work. Matriculation should take place during the first summer of residence. 86 University of Vermont Upon matriculation an adviser will be appointed by the Committee on Degrees under whose direction a systematic course of study, con\u00ad tinuing for four summers and including not less than thirty semester hours of approved graduate work, will be planned. All courses taken for credit toward this degree must be of such a character as to develop ability in research and must be passed with high standing. The course entitled, \"The Intellectual Background of Modern Life\" is required of all candi\u00ad dates for this degree. A course in general readings will be prescribed. Abstracts of these readings will be required and a preliminary oral examination will be conducted. The readings should be completed and the preliminary ex\u00ad amination should be taken as early as possible during the four summer sessions of residence. A thesis may be accepted in lieu of six semester hours of graduate study provided that it is developed under the direction of the Department of Education at the University of Vermont and is approved by the Com\u00ad mittee on Degrees. The degree Master of Education will be awarded upon the passing of a comprehensive examination when the thirty semester hours of graduate study have been completed. The fee for the Master's degree when earned through attendance at Summer Sessions is twenty-five dollars. THE TECHNICAL DEGREES The advanced degrees of Civil Engineer, Mechanical Engineer and Electrical Engineer may be conferred upon graduates of the College of Engineering of the University of Vermont of at least four years' standing, who shall have been engaged in professional work, for at least three years, in positions of responsibility and shall have shown ability to design and execute important engineering work. The candidate must present a satisfactory thesis upon some technical subject that shall show original investigation. The candidate shall pre\u00ad sent to the Committee on Degrees, not later than October 10 of the col\u00ad lege year in which the degree is sought, an outline of his thesis and a concise statement of his technical training and experience. The subject of the proposed thesis as well as the professional record shall be approved by the Committee on Degrees. The thesis shall be presented to the Committee on Degrees not later than May 15, in order that the Committee may approve and recommend the candidate for the appropriate degree. The fee for these degrees is twenty-five dollars. General Information 87 UNIVERSITY EXTENSION The aim of the University Extension work is to broaden the horizon of those who have not had the advantages of a college education and to afford an opportunity for those who have attended college to keep in touch with academic thought along their favorite lines, or to gain some information about subjects which they have not studied in college. The Extension work includes: 1. THE AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION SERVICE. 2. SUMMER SESSION. 3. EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCES. 4. CONFERENCE WITH EDITORS OF HIGH SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS. J. EXTENSION COURSES. Several departments are prepared to offer ex\u00ad tension courses in various subjects. It is possible to arrange for such courses to be given in any town where a group of reasonable size can be enrolled. Enrollment is open to all who are interested. Those who satisfactorily complete an extension course of thirty hours are granted two semester hours' credit at the University of Vermont. The State Board of Education grants to those teachers who satisfac\u00ad torily complete approved courses, limited credit towards higher cer\u00ad tificates. Information regarding courses and expenses may be obtained by addressing the Chairman of the Committee on University Ex\u00ad tension. 6. LECTURES. These are given by members of the Faculty, or other persons affiliated with the University, on topics of general interest. Single lectures, or courses of lectures (available throughout the State) are offered by members of the Faculty. The number of lectures in a courses will be determined by circumstances. A list of the lectures offered will be mailed on request and further details concerning the work indicated above may be had from the Chairman of the Commit\u00ad tee on University Extension. Inquiries relating to agriculture should be addressed to the Agricultural Extension Service. 7. RADIO BROADCASTING. Radio broadcasting is now a regular teaching method used by the Agricultural Extension Service in its work among the rural people of the state. Four stations within and one outside of Vermont are used regularly for this purpose, the equivalent of about ten broadcasts per week being made. From time to time the Univer\u00ad sity, using the facilities of a local broadcasting station, provides edu\u00ad cational programs contributed by members of the faculties of the 88 University of Vermont four colleges, the Extension Service and Experiment Station staffs. The musical programs are under the auspices of the Department of Music. A series of talks, sponsored by the Museum staff, is presented weekly throughout the year. 8. THE LIBRARIES. The books of the general and special libraries of the University are available for loan to the people of Vermont. Many books are sent each year on loan to other libraries, clubs and organiza\u00ad tions and to responsible individuals. The only charge is the cost of transportation. Application should be made to the Librarian. 9. THE FLEMING MUSEUM. The Robert Hull Fleming Museum is an active agency in the extension program of the University. The ex\u00ad hibits have been made available to city and rural schools. With the cooperation of Parent-Teachers' Associations, The Better Films Coun\u00ad cil and many other volunteer groups and individuals, the Museum offers on Saturday afternoons, entertainments, moving pictures, a story telling hour, and illustrated talks. These instructive programs interest and attract large groups of children. The Fleming Museum Art Asso\u00ad ciation has a large adult membership. Working with the Museum staff these organizations arrange addresses and special art exhibits, all of which are free to the public. University lectures, plays and musicals, as well as the programs of a number of scientific societies and civic clubs are held in the auditorium of the Museum. Many thousand peo\u00ad ple visit the Museum annually. Information can be secured from the Director. THE SUMMER SESSION A Summer Session is maintained each year for a period of six weeks. Subjects offered include Art, Botany, Chemistry, Commercial Subjects, Dramatic Art, Economics, Education, English, French, Geography, Ger\u00ad man, History, Home Economics, Industrial Arts, Italian, Latin, Mathe\u00ad matics, Music (instrumental and vocal), Philosophy, Physical Education, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Spanish, and Zoology. The school is intended to meet the needs of various groups of students, such as: 1. Students or teachers who have completed a four-year college course and who wish to take advanced work for credit toward the Master's degrees. 2. Principals and superintendents of schools who desire to take funda\u00ad mental or specialized courses in the fields of Educational Administra\u00ad tion and Supervision. Admission 111 ENTRANCE SUBJECTS ENGLISH The requirement in English is designed to develop in the student the ability to read with understanding, knowledge and judgment of litera\u00ad ture, and accurate thinking and power in oral and written expression. This training is to be viewed not merely in its bearing upon the stu\u00ad dent's work in courses in English, but in its relation to his work in all other subjects. A fundamental aim in the study of literature is to develop the stu\u00ad dent's enjoyment of good reading, and his recognition of the varied elements in literature, particularly the artistic, social, and personal. No formal process of study should obscure this aim. Any carefully or\u00ad ganized course of secondary school study of literature should recognize the importance of immediate interest in the thing read, and meet the need of clear understanding of its content and of its general significance in relation to author, period, type, and social background. The measure of the student's achievement in literature will be ability to discuss his reading intelligently, with adequate scope, and with a usable knowledge of elementary critical terms. A satisfactory course should therefore pro\u00ad vide a sufficient acquaintance with traditionally great literature and with recognized literary types. Training in composition aims to stimulate the student's original powers of expression, both logical and imaginative, and to enable him to develop and organize his material in a way that reflects his own incentives and interests. The test in composition will assume continuous and thorough train\u00ad ing in mechanics. This training implies a mastery in practice of the essentials of grammar as an aid to the discussion of phraseology, syntax and general structure, and of problems of meaning and interpretation. It implies also habitual correctness in punctuation, spelling, capitalization, and sentence and paragraph construction. In addition, it assumes a reasonable maturity of vocabulary, and such a command of varied and flexible sentence forms as may be expected from rigorous and systematic training in language as the effective instrument of thought. Such in\u00ad struction necessitates constant and painstaking practice by the candidate in criticism and revision of his own written work. This training should be directed to the expansion and intelligent order\u00ad ing of the student's experience, and the increase of his sense of power and enjoyment in writing. 112 University of Vermont It is important that as far as possible the student be taught to use library facilities such as dictionaries, encyclopedias, card catalogues, indices, periodicals, readers' guides, and other works of reference. The examination assumes a close and thoughtful acquaintance with a substantial amount of worthy literature, and a general knowledge of the more important literary types. These should include Drama, Prose Narrative, Poetry, Essays, Biography and Miscellaneous Prose. Teachers and students are referred to a list of suggested readings in English published annually by the College Entrance Examinations Board, 431 West 117th Street, New York City. However accurate in subject-matter, no entrance paper in English will be considered satisfactory if seriously defective in punctuation, spell\u00ad ing, or other essentials of good usage. The examination may be divided into two parts, one on grammar and composition (2 UNITS), and the other on literature (1 UNIT). In grammar and composition, the candidate may be asked specific questions upon the practical essentials of these studies. The main test in composition will consist of one or more essays, developing a theme through several paragraphs. The subjects will be drawn from the books read, from the candidate's other studies, and from his personal knowledge and experience quite apart from reading. LATIN There is no prescription either of the amount to be read or of particular authors. It is recommended, however, that the classical Latin read in the last three years of the high school course or their equivalent be no less in amount than the following: Second year, Csesar, Gallic War, Books I and II; Third year, Cicero, the first three orations Against Catiline, the oration In Behalf of the Poet Archias, and the oration For the Manilian Law; Fourth year, Virgil, Aeneid, about three thousand lines. The essen\u00ad tial point is not the amount read but the command of vocabulary, forms and syntax which the entering student has actually acquired. The examinations are of two types and all candidates may choose between them: Type I, (a) a passage or passages for translation into Latin; (b) passages of Latin prose and poetry for translation at sight. Type II, (a) a passage or passages for translation into Latin; (b) passages of Latin prose and poetry for translation at sight; (c) passages for trans\u00ad lation taken from the following works, which are recommended as part of the high school reading: Csesar, Gallic War, Book II; Cicero, the oration In Behalf of the Poet Archias, and the first oration Against Catiline; Virgil, Aeneid, Books IV and VI. Admission 113 Examinations of both types contain questions on subject-matter, literary and historical allusions, and prosody, as well as on forms and syntax. Examinations may be taken for 2 UNITS, 3 UNITS or 4 UNITS credit. GREEK A thorough knowledge of the common grammatical forms and elemen\u00ad tary construction of Attic Greek; Xenophon's Anabasis, four books; the translation into Greek of simple sentences based on the Anabasis, and the translation into English of a previously unseen passage from some work of Xenophon. (2 UNITS.) Homer's Iliad, three books; the translation of a previously unseen passage, which presents no great difficulties, from the Homeric poems; the Homeric metre, the simpler forms and constructions of the Homeric dialect, and a certain degree of familiarity with contents, literary char\u00ad acter and background of the Homeric poems; the translation into prose Greek of a simple connected passage based on Book II of the Anabasis. The candidate may offer equivalents for the suggested readings. (1 UNIT.) FRENCH The first year of French should include the elements of the grammar, careful drill in pronunciation, abundant writing of easy French prose. In the grammar, one year's work should cover the essential elements. The reading should represent the completion of a good reader and such texts as Contes de Fees, Halevy's Abbe Constantin or Laboulaye's Contes bleus. The second year's work should include a more detailed study of the grammar, and the reading of about 250 pages of French prose and poetry of average difficulty, practice in translation at sight, ability to translate into French English sentences of moderate difficulty. The grammar should represent the content of a standard French grammar. Suitable texts are: About, Le Roi des Montagnes; tion frangaise; Ferrichon; Malot, Sans Famille, etc. (2 UNITS.) The third year should include thorough study of the grammar and the reading of about 300-400 pages of standard French, together with practice in translating into French passages of connected English. Part II of Fraser and Squair's French Grammar, or a work of similar content, would satisfy the requirement. Suitable texts are: Hugo, Hernani of Vermont parte en Egypte; Corneille, Le Cid; Moliere, le Bourgeois Gentilhomme; Racine, Atbalie. Dictations should be employed frequently to accustom the ear to the sounds of the spoken language. In the second and third year it will be found useful to devote some time to abstracts and paraphrases in French of portions of the works read. \"Where possible elementary practice with conversational exercises is desirable. (1 UNIT.) GERMAN In Elementary German, which presupposes two years of work, the chief aim should be the ability to read with comprehension easy German prose. As a means to the acquisition of this ability, particular attention should be given to accurate pronunciation, to oral and aural drill, and to the building up of a vocabulary of common words and expressions. The study of grammar during the first two years is regarded as subsidiary to the acquisition of reading abililty. This reading knowledge may be tested by translation of sight passages or by English answers to German questions on passages set. In the first year, 75 to 100 pages should be covered in class, a slightly smaller amount of very easy material as col\u00ad lateral reading outside class. In the second year, the amount covered in class should be 200 to 250 pages, with collateral reading of easier texts totaling 150 to 200 pages. Some of the material read may deal with physical and historical aspects of Germany. The following texts, arranged in approximate order of difficulty, are suggested: Koischwitz' Purin and Rose's Deutsche Kulturhunde. (2 UNITS.) In the third year, 400 or more pages of prose and poetry from the works of standard authors should be read in class, 300 or more pages outside class. Emphasis should also be placed on a command of simple German in speech and in writing. The following are suitable texts: Freytag, Die Journalisten; Lessing, Minna von and Die Jungfrau von Orleans; Goethe, some poems and Hermann und Dorothea; poems and Die Harzreise; Sudermann, Manner im Schnee; Bahr, Das Konzert. (1 UNIT.) SPANISH A year's study of Spanish should assure a knowledge of the elements of the grammar, ability to pronounce accurately, to translate easy Spanish prose, and to turn into Spanish simple English sentences. About 100 Admission 115 duodecimo pages should be read, and careful drill given in Castilian pro\u00ad nunciation. The student should have learned the conjugations of the regular, radical-changing and the more common irregular verbs. In the second year the work should include the reading of about 200 to 300 pages of Spanish of average difficulty, mastery of the grammar and syn\u00ad tax, with frequent exercises in composition. The student should com\u00ad plete his knowledge of the radical changing and irregular verbs with the exception of rare verbs and forms. Suitable texts are: Juan Valera, El pdjaro de Alarcon, de Alar- con, or Antonio de Trueba, selected short stories. Throughout the course dictation should be employed to accustom the ear to the sounds of spoken Spanish. From time to time abstracts and paraphrases may be made in Spanish of portions of the works read. Where possible, elementary conversational exercises are desirable. During the two years regular practice in pronunciation should not be neglected. (2 UNITS.) HISTORY Each unit allowed for entrance in History presupposes one year of formal study in the particular subject, using an accurate text. It is ex\u00ad pected that appropriate selections which give the student some acqaint- ance with sources and contribute to the historical background, shall have been read. There should be instruction in comparing historical char\u00ad acters, institutions, periods, and events and in tracing the steps in the development of important movements through a considerable period of time. Practice should be given in locating places, areas, boundaries and routes which are historically important. One-half or one unit may be presented in any of the following subjects: Ancient History, European History, English History, and American History. ANCIENT HISTORY. The course should devote one-half of the year to the study of the ancient Orient and Greece as far as the death of Alex\u00ad ander and the break-up of his empire, with the expansion of Greek culture in the Mediterranean World. The second half-year should be devoted to the study of the history of Rome to the year 476 A. D. Since not more than one-tenth of the whole time available can be allotted to the study of the history of the Orient, only so much of its narrative history should be studied as will hold the story together and fix its geography and its time relations. Emphasis should be laid not upon the details of military and political history but upon the civilization 116 University of Vermont developed by the different peoples of the Orient, with particular reference to the contributions which they made to later ages. In the study of Greek history, little time should be spent on the period prior to the Persian Wars, except to deal concretely with Homeric society and to emphasize the expansion of Hellas. From the Persian Wars to the death of Alexander the study should be exact and thorough, with special reference to the political, intellectual, and artistic develop\u00ad ment of Hellas during the Age of Pericles. Instead of trying to trace the constitutional development of Athens and Sparta from the begin\u00ad ning, the operation of the government in these states at the time of their maturity should be mastered. In the period following the death of Alexander no attempt should be made to follow the intricate political history of the time, but opportunity should be found to study the federal government of Greece, and the philosophy, literature, art, and religious cults which were the factors of the mixed Graeco-Oriental culture of which Rome became the heir. At the beginning of the second half-year the history of Rome to about the year 300 B. C. should be covered very rapidly. The attempt should be made rather to understand the organization and working of Senatorial government in the third and second centuries B. C. than to trace the changes made in Roman institutions in the fifth and fourth centuries. From 300 B. C. to the death of Marcus Aurelius the study must be rela\u00ad tively detailed and thorough. (l/z OR 1 UNIT. ) EUROPEAN HISTORY. Students who are offering Modern European his\u00ad tory should emphasize the absolute monarchy of Louis XIV, colonial expansion and rivalries, the development of the constitutional monarchy in England, the enlightened despotism of Frederick the Great, the republi\u00ad can government of Revolutionary France, the Napoleonic epoch, and the main facts in the political development of Europe since 1815. Special emphasis should be laid upon the industrial Revolution\u2014its political and social aspects\u2014upon the growth of nationalism and democracy, and upon the economic expansion of the European possessions outside of Europe. The study of the last half-century should include some account of the great material changes, important inventions, and intellectual and social and humanitarian movements. Students who are offering Medieval and Modern European history should emphasize the contributions of the Roman Empire, the Germans, and the Christian Church to medieval civilization. The structure of feudal society, the Crusades, the formation of the European states, the several phases of the Renaissance and of the Reformation, and the dis\u00ad coveries outside of Europe should be covered. Students who are offering Admission 117 this subject will not be held to so detailed a knowledge of the nineteenth century as those offering Modern European history. (/2 OR 1 UNIT.) ENGLISH HISTORY. The division of the work between the two half-years should be made at about 1660. During the first half-year, the periods of the Tudors and the early Stuarts should receive emphasis. Only the briefest reference to the period before 1066 need be made, and from the Norman Conquest to the acces\u00ad sion of the Tudors the treatment should be topical rather than exhaustive. It should deal with the effects of the Norman Conquest, relations with France, Scotland, and Ireland, Magna Carta and the origins of Parlia\u00ad ment, and the emergence of parliamentary government out of the feudal monarchy. Some attempt also should be made to explain the develop\u00ad ment and character of the Christian Church in England, its relations with the papacy, the severance of these relations, the establishment of the national church, and the Puritan movement. In the second half-year, starting with the Restoration, attention should be given first to the continued struggle between Crown and Parliament, culminating in the establishment of responsible government. In study\u00ad ing the great wars with France, attention should be directed to the com\u00ad mercial and colonial expansion in America and the East. \"With regard to imperial policy, the causes and effects of the Scottish and Irish unions and the revolt of the American colonies should be explained. The study of the revolution in agriculture, industry, and transportation should include some consideration of the consequent political and social reforms. Since the Reform Act of 1867, emphasis should be laid upon the more important reforms affecting economic, political, and social life, and upon the problem of Ireland. Some idea should be given of the growth and nature of the British power in the colonies and the problem of imperial organization. In general, it is desirable to emphasize the important epochs and move\u00ad ments rather than the reigns of the monarchs; to trace developments; to secure a clear comprehension of the more influential personalities; and to show the relations of English history to the history of other countries, especially the United States. ( % OR 1 UNIT. ) AMERICAN HISTORY. The period of American history prior to 1763 may be treated briefly as a background for subsequent epochs. The period since the Civil War should receive adequate attention (about as much time as the period between 1763 and 1863). Questions on current events will not be asked. For the guidance of both the teacher and the student, it is suggested that careful attention should be paid to map studies; that the topics of 118 University of Vermont slavery and secession should not be emphasized at the expense of the study of territorial expansion and social and industrial growth; that due atten\u00ad tion should be paid to the policy of the United States in foreign affairs, tariff, banking, civil service, currency, trusts, conservation of natural resources, capital and labor, immigration, and other present-day problems; and that familiarity with the lives and public services of great Americans should be especially encouraged. (OR 1 UNIT. ) CIVIL GOVERNMENT The study of civil government should include a careful analysis of the Constitution of the United States\u2014the powers, organization, and functions of the federal government, the relations between the state and the federal government, and the general nature and extent of the powers reserved to the states. This study should be closely coordinated with American history at every point of contact. (J4 OR 1 UNIT.) MATHEMATICS ALGEBRA TO QUADRATICS. The examination will presuppose a knowledge of the meaning, use, evaluation, transformation and derivation of formulas; the construction and interpretation of graphs, the meaning and use of negative numbers; solution of simple and simultaneous linear equations, with verification; ratio, proportion, and variation; the essentials of algebraic technique; exponents and radicals; numerical trigonometry.

Solution of simple trigonometric equations. Theory and use of logarithms (without the in\u00ad troduction of work involving infinite series). The solution of right and oblique triangles, and practical applications. (J4 UNIT. ) PHYSICS Preparation should include the study of a standard text-book, instruc\u00ad tion by lecture-table demonstration and individual laboratory work. The classroom and lecture instruction should aim to give the student a clear and comprehensive view of the general principles of the subject with their applications to various natural phenomena and to practical problems. The laboratory work should fix these general principles in the student's mind and render them more concrete. The student should develop a habit of accurate observation and should understand the scientific method of basing theories and principles upon experiment. Emphasis should occasionally be placed on the accuracy of the measurements and on the reliability of the conclusions drawn from them. Every candidate must present at the time of the examination, a note\u00ad book certified by the teacher and containing in the candidate's own language a description of the laboratory exercises with a careful and 120 University of Vermont systematic record of observations made and of conclusions drawn. (1 UNIT.) CHEMISTRY The requirements should be the equivalent of a course based on one of the recognized secondary school texts. Greater importance is attached to training in observation and to a knowledge of the properties of common chemical substances than to an understanding of purely theoretical conceptions. An original, uncopied, laboratory notebook, containing any comments and corrections that may have been made by the instructor must be pre\u00ad sented by the candidate at the time of the examination. (1 UNIT.) BOTANY Elementary work in the structure and physiology of seed plants together with an introduction to their classification as outlined in any recent textbook.

Correctness of proportion, accuracy in the relations of parts of figures and neatness in the execution of the work should be secured. A fair knowledge of perspective and the application of light and shade in free-hand sketching is necessary. At least twenty drawings representing a year's work in the preparatory school, should be submitted for the lower requirement in this subject, each bearing the certificate of the instructor in charge of the work. (J4 OR 1 UNIT.) MECHANICAL DRAWING The candidate should always have a knowledge of the proper methods of using the T-square, triangles, and other drawing instruments, with special reference to their use in drawing parallel lines, erecting perpen\u00ad diculars and in drawing arcs of circles and irregular curves. The plates presented should include examples of geometric construc\u00ad tions, orthographic projections, isometric projection and working draw\u00ad ings of simple objects. It is not desirable that all plates be inked. (J4 OR 1 UNIT.) SHOPWORK The candidate should present evidence of sufficient training to enable him to execute a piece of work with skill, accuracy and neatness in each of the branches offered for admission; should be acquainted with the materials used in the various classes of work and understand the physical properties of these materials; should have a good working knowledge of the tools and machines of the different branches of shopwork and under\u00ad stand their care and operation. It is especially necessary that he should 122 University of Vermont have a thorough understanding of the process used and the principles involved in all of the work that he does. In woodworking, forge work and foundry work one year's time is required in preparation for each subject, and in machine shopwork two years' time. A detailed statement of the work done must be presented, signed by the school instructor or shop superintendent. (OR 1 UNIT.) STENOGRAPHY Speed and accuracy are the tests of the candidate's preparation in this topic. A speed of sixty words per minute is required. (J4 OR 1 UNIT.) COMMERCIAL SUBJECTS A limited amount of credit is allowed in certain cases, for high school courses in commercial subjects. (J4 TO 2 UNITS.) AGRICULTURE The requirements are those established by (a) the State Board of Edu\u00ad cation for approved courses in schools not receiving the benefit of Federal appropriations under the Smith-Hughes or George-Deen Acts; or (b) by the State Board of Vocational Education for approved courses in schools receiving the benefit of Federal appropriations under the Smith-Hughes or George-Deen Acts. A half unit of credit may be accorded upon the com\u00ad pletion of each year of the former course which year comprises three double and one single period per week throughout the year, together with an acceptably executed program of supervised practice work. (}4 To 2 UNITS.) From 1 to 1 l/z units credit may be accorded for the completion of each year of the Federal aid course, which year comprises five double periods per week throughout the year together with an efficiently planned, ex\u00ad ecuted and accounted six-months' program of supervised practice. In no case can more than four units be used for college entrance and this maxi\u00ad mum only in the College of Agriculture. The report of the State Super\u00ad visor of Agricultural Education will be considered in determining the exact amount of credit in each case. (I TO 4 UNITS. ) HOME ECONOMICS The requirements are set forth in the \"Course of Study in Home Economics\" issued by the State Board of Education and apply to all Admission 125 THE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE PRE-MEDICAL PREPARATION Most approved Medical Colleges now require at least three years of acceptable pre-medical preparation which must be completed at an institu\u00ad tion recognized by the American Medical Association. It is recommended that all students who intend to apply for admission to the College of Medicine of this University complete a four-year liberal arts curriculum which includes the subjects prescribed by the American Medical Associa\u00ad tion. The minimum requirement, however, may be met by completing the seven-year combination curriculum, which leads to the baccalaureate degree at the end of the first year in Medicine and the degree of Doctor of Medicine at the end of the seven-year period. An outline of this curriculum will be found elsewhere in this Catalogue. As pre-medical and medical curricula have been correlated at the Uni\u00ad versity of Vermont, if preparation is to be taken at another institution, the courses elected should correspond as closely as possible with the subject-matter included in the pre-medical work given in the College of Arts and Sciences. SELECTIVE ADMISSION PROCEDURE Since enrollment in the first year class of the College of Medicine must be limited to approximately thirty students, the full responsibility for the selection of these students has been delegated to a Medical Admissions Committee. Because of an appropriation to the College of Medicine by the State of Vermont, the applications of residents of this State are given pref\u00ad erence. After qualified Vermont students have been registered, the applications of sons and daughters of the graduates of the University of Vermont are considered. If vacancies should remain after these two groups have been examined, the quota will be filled from the best quali\u00ad fied applications of non-residents. The eligibility of an applicant for enrollment in the first year class is finally determined by the Medical Admissions Committee. In its selec\u00ad tions the Committee considers three factors: 1. The quality and quantity of the pre-medical training. 2. The score received in the Medical Aptitude Test which is given annually throughout the country under the auspices of the Association of American Medical Colleges. 126 University of Vermont 3. The personality and general fitness of the applicant for the study of medicine, as determined, in part, by personal interview of the applicant with the Medical Admissions Committee. The Committee will not interview students with unsatisfactory scholastic records or a low score in the Aptitude Test. Application should be made not later than March 1 of the year in which admission is sought. Students having low scholastic records are advised not to apply. ADVANCED STANDING In general, vacancies arising in the three upper classes will not be filled. In its discretion, however, the Medical Admissions Committee may enter\u00ad tain applications of well qualified residents of this State who have done medical work in other acceptable medical schools. No applicant for advanced standing will be enrolled under more favorable conditions than would obtain if the student were to continue at the school first attended. All applications from students having conditons or low scholastic records will be refused. Courses of Instruction The University offers instruction in four colleges: The College of Arts and Sciences The College of Engineering The College of Agriculture The College of Medicine In all colleges, except Medicine, the undergraduate courses are num\u00ad bered from 0 to 99; those courses which may be taken for undergraduate or graduate credit are numbered from 100 to 199. Courses offered for graduate credit only are numbered from 200 to 299. The courses in Elementary Education are numbered from 300 to 399 and the courses in Industrial Education from 400 to 499. The courses in Elementary and Industrial Education are separate from the courses offered in the four colleges. Following the description of each course the number of semester hours credit is indicated. For full year courses this credit must be doubled. Courses that are required are indicated and when elective the classifica\u00ad tions and prerequisites are given. Rotating and alternating courses show the college year during which these courses are to be given. Lecture and recitation periods are fifty minutes, laboratory periods at least 110 minutes in length.

The Curricula The University of Vermont and State Agricultural College offers a variety of curricula in its four colleges: Arts and Sciences, Engineering, Agriculture, and Medicine. These are fully described in this section. There are also three curricula that are given in cooperation with the Vermont State Board of Education, the degrees being voted by the Board of Trustees on recommendation of the Department of Education and the Senate Committee on Degrees. The Elementary Education curriculum and the Music Education curriculum lead to the degree of Bachelor of Education. In the Industrial Education curriculum the degree is Bachelor of Science in Education. All baccalaureate degrees require four resident college years or the equivalent. THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES offers instruction in Art, Botany, Chemistry, Economics including Secretarial Studies, Education, English, Forestry, Geology, German, Greek, History, Home Economics, Latin, Mathematics, Mineralogy, Music, Philosophy, Physics, Political Science, Psychology, Romance Languages including French, Italian and Spanish, Sociology and Zoology. There are four group elective and five specialized curricula. Group Elective Curricula Classical Literary-Scientific Social Science General Science and Pre-Medical Specialized Curricula Chemistry Business, Secretarial, and Commercial Teaching Secondary Education Degree Bachelor of Arts Bachelor of Philosophy Bachelor of Philosophy Bachelor of Science Degree Bachelor of Science in Chemistry Bachelor of Science in Commerce and Economics Bachelor of Science in Education THE COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING offers three curricula: Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering, each leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in the field of specialization. THE COLLEGE OF AGRICULTURE offers optional curricula in five profes\u00ad sional fields: Teaching, Plant Industry, Dairy Production, Dairy Manu- 223 224 The Curricula factures, and Agricultural Economics, each leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Agriculture. There is also a curriculum in Home Economics leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in that subject. THE COLLEGE OF MEDICINE offers an approved curriculum leading to the degree of Doctor of Medicine. Three or more years of college pre- medical preparation must be completed before enrollment. The College of Arts and Sciences GROUP ELECTIVE CURRICULA THE CLASSICAL, LITERARY-SCIENTIFIC, SOCIAL SCIENCE, AND GENERAL SCIENCE CURRICULA are offered under the group elective plan and pre\u00ad sent opportunities for major work in almost any department or field of study that may particularly interest an individual student. By proper selection of the curriculum and wise choice of subject matter, these courses of study serve as a basis for professional and technical training, particularly in connection with education, law, journalism, dentistry and medicine. For those having no definite objective these curricula provide a liberal education in the arts and sciences yielding results in personal satisfaction, improved opportunities for success, and a greater usefulness in later life. Students who are especially interested in languages should consider the Classical or Literary-Scientific curriculum. Those whose primary interests lie in the fields of Economics, History, Philosophy, Political Science or Psychology may choose the Social Science curriculum. The General Science curriculum is offered as a preparation for Medicine and the other scientific professions, as well as to students to whom the sciences and mathematics have particular appeal. These curricula consist of a required group of courses to provide foundation; major and minor specialization in two related departments, to insure concentration; a group of restricted electives, to provide reason\u00ad able distribution of studies; and free electives, to provide for individual interest and self-expression. THE REQUIRED GROUP OF COURSES, each of which must be completed by all students before graduation, are: English 1, English 2, English 26, Mathematics 1, two courses in Physical Education and either Psychology 1 or Philosophy 1-2. Military Science is required of all men during the The College of Arts and Sciences 225 Freshman and Sophomore years. Each course is taken for credit and this credit is an integral part of the student's record and is counted toward graduation. A MAJOR AND RELATED MINOR is required of each student enrolled in a Group Elective curriculum. A course is the formal resident study of a subject for three hours a week during one college year. A minor con\u00ad sists of two and a major of three approved courses in the same depart\u00ad ment, normally taken in consecutive college years. A related minor is a minor completed in a department or subject that is considered related to the work in the department in which the required major was taken. Group electives are courses suggested as to their general field and chosen to satisfy the required distribution of studies. Free electives are courses which the student chooses to supplement the required courses and re\u00ad stricted group electives in sufficient amount to meet the minimum credit hour requirement for the degree. Greek A, Latin A, Latin B, English 1 and English 2 are not counted as parts of any major, related minor or minor specified as a group elective. French 1, German X and Spanish 1 are counted as parts of group elective minors but are not considered as parts of the required major or related minor. At least three of the five minimum courses of the major and related minor must be taken during Junior and Senior years, and at least one course during Senior year. In the Social Science curriculum the major and related minor must be chosen from the departments of Economics, History, Political Science, Philosophy, and Psychology. In the General Science curriculum the major and related minors must be taken in Science and Mathematics. Two of the three courses of the major and the two courses of the related minor may either or both be counted as group elective minors. THE GROUP ELECTIVES, which insure a reasonable distribution of studies, are different in each Group Elective curriculum. The teaching departments of the College of Arts and Sciences are listed in three groups which provide the broad foundation for this dis\u00ad tribution. These divisions are: Languages and Literatures, Social Sciences, and Science and Mathematics. Languages\u2014Greek, Latin, English, German, French, Spanish, Italian. Social Sciences\u2014Philosophy, Psychology, History, Economics, Sociology, Political Science, Education. Sciences\u2014Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Botany, Zoology, Geology, Mineralogy, Forestry. 226 The Curricula Although Psychology is listed in the Social Science group, the course in Experimental Psychology 106 may be counted as a non-laboratory science by students who are not majoring in Psychology. Music, omitted above, is considered a Social Science group subject to the extent that a major in it may be counted as three courses in the Social Science group. Only students in the Classical and Literary Scientific curricula may take music as the required major. Home Economics is omitted as the courses offered may be taken only as free electives. The system of elective studies begins with the Sophomore year. On or before May 1 of each year each student submits to the Dean a state\u00ad ment of the courses which he plans to take to satisfy the major, related minor and group electives of the curriculum in which he is enrolled. The choice of the major must be approved in writing by the head of the department in which the proposed courses are taught. A special form is provided for this report. THE FREE ELECTIVES. The elective courses account for about one-third of the graduation requirement in each Group Elective curriculum. They are chosen in the last two years in sufficient amount to make the enroll\u00ad ment total at least thirty-one hours in the Junior and thirty hours in the Senior year. Except with special permission, no student shall enroll in more than eighteen hours per week if during the previous half-year he has obtained a grade lower than \"A\" in more than one-half of his work. Any student who desires to elect courses in other colleges of the University, or to take more than eighteen or less than fifteen hours per week, must obtain the approval of the Dean of the college in which he is enrolled. The student should choose his free electives with a deliberate purpose and should make judicious additions to his major and related minor. The intensive study of some subject or group of subjects is strongly recom\u00ad mended. THE CLASSICAL CURRICULUM The entire record of each candidate for the A.B. degree from this curriculum must show the credit expressed in each of the following requirements: The required courses. An approved major and related minor. A minor in college Greek or Latin. A second minor either in the other classical language or in French, German or Spanish. The College of Arts and Sciences 227 Four courses in the Social Sciences.

Those who wish to combine the science courses which are required for medical school admission with a Classical, Literary-Scientific or Social Science enroll\u00ad ment must plan the course sequences in advance in order to be sure of meeting both pre-medical and degree requirements at the end of four years. For those choosing a shorter preparation, the seven-year combination curriculum is offered. This requires three years in the College of Arts and Sciences, the Bachelor's degree being awarded on the completion of the first year's work in any approved medical school. Students who 230 The Curricula do not secure admission to a medical college may enroll as seniors in the General Science curriculum and complete the requirements for the Bache\u00ad lor of Science degree in that year. Combination curricula are possible in other group elective curricula, but careful planning of the enroll\u00ad ment is necessary during the three pre-medical years. The synopsis of the Pre-Medical curriculum given below is based upon the group requirements of General Science. It also includes those courses which have been recommended by the College of Medicine. English is required in each year. In Chemistry, Physics, and Zoology credits in excess of those suggested by the American Medical Associa\u00ad tion are included. Mathematics 1, two years of French or German, and a course in Psychology are required. For men eight hours of credit in Military Science must be completed. Students who complete three years and decide to enroll for a senior year must enroll in Mathematics 2 (Calculus). For men enrolled in the Pre-Medical curriculum the require\u00ad ments are as follows: Freshman year, 42 hours; Sophomore year, 38 hours; Junior year, 32 to 36 hours. For women the totals are four hours less in each of the first two years, due to exemption from Military Science. The men's minimum of unpledged degree credit at the end of the third year, which includes eight hours of Military Science and four hours of Physical Education, is 108 semester hours. For women this minimum is 100. Students who have fewer credits, or who lack any required sub\u00ad ject, are not eligible to apply for admission to the College of Medicine. At the beginning of the third year all Pre-Medical students must rent or purchase an approved physician's microscope for use in the courses in Cytology and Embryology. Microscopes which meet the require\u00ad ments of these courses and those later given in College of Medicine are rented and sold on both cash and installment plans at the Medical Book Store. Arrangements can be made to have rentals apply on subsequent purchase. THE PRE-MEDICAL CURRICULUM THE FRESHMAN YEAR 1ST HF. 2ND HF.

Through expansion of some phases of the work and the curtailing of others it has been possible to carry out more fully the original intentions of the founder. The basic curriculum is the Business option and it is recommended to those who seek training for a general business career. The Secretarial option is advised for those who wish to prepare to become business or professional secretaries. The Commercial Teaching option includes the specialized training and the courses in Education which are necessary to secure positions as teachers of commercial subjects in business or second\u00ad ary schools. The degree, received on the completion of any of these options, is Bachelor of Science in Commerce and Economics. For the earlier years of the curriculum the courses are substantially the same. In the later years the more special subjects are introduced. The only difference between the Secretarial and the Teaching options is that the latter prescribes those courses in Education that are required for teachers' certificates. These hours are open as electives for the secre\u00ad tarial students. It is thus possible to defer the choice until the beginning of the junior year, and in special cases the choice may be deferred until the end of the junior year. 232 The Curricula In all modern business, special training is coming to be regarded as more and more necessary. In many quarters the college is looked to for this training. For this there exist very excellent reasons, since with a well-balanced curriculum one may combine the maximum of culture furnishing broader interests and a wider outlook on life with a maximum of special training resulting from carefully directed study in the scientific spirit of various phases of industrial activity. Such a combination is sought in the adjustment of the work. In all the work of the department prompt attention to all duties will be expected on the part of each student. As success in business rests in a very important way upon regularity, punctuality and systematic atten\u00ad tion to all duties, it is very necessary that constant attention be given to these. For this reason the Department insists that all duties required be performed with promptness and care. Regularity in attendance upon all exercises is held as an important requirement of the work. The quantitative requirements of the curriculum are outlined in the following paragraphs. Modifications may be made with the approval of the head of the department to meet instances of special purpose. THE BUSINESS CURRICULA THE FRESHMAN YEAR 1ST HF. 2ND HF.

That it may be broadly informative, and meet more fully individual needs and tastes, the curriculum includes as full a measure of elective studies as justice to its special field allows. The required contributory studies are confined to the first two years of the curriculum, leaving free for specialization and for election the last years, when experience and maturity give this freedom greatest value. Much of the student's thought and time in the second half of the Senior year are devoted to a simple, but rigorously followed and carefully guided original investigation. In connection with the courses in Industrial Chemistry, students each year make trips of inspection to other laboratories and to industrial estab\u00ad lishments. The Chemistry Club, an undergraduate organization, increases fellow\u00ad ship and enthusiasm for scientific work. Graduates of the Department are engaged as teachers of the science in universities and schools, as technical chemists in a wide range of indus\u00ad tries, and as men of business in various commercial and industrial under\u00ad takings. In manufacturing enterprises that are not definitely chemical, training in an exact science, like chemistry, is recognized as of advantage. Chemistry laboratories and supply rooms occupy three floors and the basement of the north end of the Williams Science Hall. These labora\u00ad tories are modern and well equipped for experimental and research work. The department library is conveniently located in this building. A list of the required courses and of hours free for election in the Chemistry Curriculum are given in the following paragraphs. An outline of each course is found in the Catalogue under Courses of Instruction. Students of other curricula, who wish to do special work in Chemistry, on consultation may select one of several groups of courses, each group constituting a major in Chemistry. Those taking a major in Chemistry must maintain a favorable standing in the subject. At the close of the Freshman year, transfer to or from the Chemistry Curriculum is readily made, without loss of credits. Students whose grades in Introductory Chemistry are not C or better at the close of the year are discouraged from entering or continuing the curriculum. Those who become especially interested in chemistry and who show ability in the subject are welcomed. The College of Arts and Sciences 235 In addition to its undergraduate courses, the facilities of the Depart\u00ad ment permit graduate work, leading to the degree of Master of Science. Students have found this further training of great value in meeting the exactions of professional work, and in gaining advanced standing toward earning the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the larger universities. Correspondence with the head of the Department is invited regarding opportunities for graduate work, and lines of research on which members of the staff are engaged.

They also have general cultural value for those who desire to elect subjects in the department. Students in Education will find it desirable to take the course entitled General Psychology before the Junior year, as this subject serves as the basis of the courses in Education. The department offers a four-year curriculum in Secondary Education for the preparation of teachers for the junior and senior high school, leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Education. Students who have fully satisfied the requirements of the first two years in a group elective curriculum may be permitted to transfer to Junior standing in this curriculum. The degree will be granted after the completion of at least sixty-one semester hours which must include any requirements not previously passed. Students wishing to make this transfer should present a request in writing to the Dean before September 1 of the year in which they intend to make such change. This petition must be approved by the Head of the Department of Education, the Dean of the College from which the stu\u00ad dent proposes to transfer and the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. Such transfer will be permitted only in exceptional cases from the College of Engineering, the College of Agriculture, and the Business Curricula in the College of Arts and Sciences. In all cases the previous academic record must be such as to indicate that the student will profit from this curriculum in Education. The requirements of the Department of Education are: General Psy\u00ad chology (Psychology 1) six semester hours; Principles of Education (Education 1) three semester hours; Philosophy of Education (Educa\u00ad tion J) three semester hours; and History of Education (Education 2) or Educational Psychology (Education 3) three semester hours; and High School Administration (Education 6) or Psychology of Adolescence (Education 4) three semester hours; Principles and Methods in Second\u00ad ary Education (Education 7) or other approved course three semester hours; Student Teaching (Education 8) or other approved course three semester hours; a full course in laboratory science six to ten semester hours; two majors and one minor from three departments in the College of Arts and Sciences so chosen as to give the student a suitable prepara\u00ad tion to teach these subjects in the secondary schools; and Junior Reading (English 26). The College of Arts and Sciences 237 Additional approved electives to give a further preparation in the subjects which the student is preparing to teach and to broaden the gen\u00ad eral scope of his course will be recommended or required. These electives must bring the number of credits at least to a total of one hundred twenty semester hours exclusive of English 26, Physical Education 1 and 2 and, (for men), Military Science 1 and 2. Students planning to enter the teaching profession are urged to consult the Department of Education with reference to the selection of courses, as early as possible in their college course. In general students planning to transfer to the curriculum in Education after completing the first two years in any curriculum of the University should complete during those years: two courses in a foreign language, a laboratory course in science, Psychology 1, and a course in either History or Political Science. The Literary-Scientific, Social Science and General Science curricula are so arranged that a student may make these elections and still have freedom to start fulfilling the requirements for a major in Education. The majors and minors taken should be chosen to correlate with the subjects that occur generally in high school curricula. The departments and subject-matter fields which are recommended are: English; the languages, especially French and Latin; the Sciences; Mathematics; His\u00ad tory and certain Social Sciences, especially Political Science and Eco\u00ad nomics. Teachers of Agriculture and Home Economics in the public schools should also be prepared to teach a more general subject. Physical Education is a valuable supplementary major for those who have sufficient interest and ability in that field. The University offers special cur\u00ad ricula for those preparing to teach Commercial Subjects and Music. Any student enrolled in any of the academic colleges may, with the permission of the Dean of the college in which he is enrolled, and of the Professor of Education, be admitted to any of the courses in Education for which he is qualified. He shall retain his standing in the college in which he is enrolled and be entitled to the degree to which it leads. A course in Student Teaching, using a public school system as a laboratory is a prerequisite to a certificate to teach in most states. \"While such a course is required for a degree in Education at the University, enrollment in Student Teaching is limited to those: (I) who have declared an intention to teach, (2) who have high scholastic records, (3) who show promise of becoming successful teachers. While the curricula in Education are designed primarily to meet the requirements for certificates in the State of Vermont it is possible to meet the requirements of many other states if the department is notified prior to the Sophomore year. 238 The Curricula SECONDARY EDUCATION CURRICULUM THE FRESHMAN YEAR 1ST HF. 2ND HF.

The Department of Education 239 THE ELEMENTARY EDUCATION CURRICULUM This curriculum is offered by the University in cooperation with the Vermont State Board of Education. It is intended to offer an excellent preparation for teaching in the elementary schools. The degree of Bachelor of Education is given by the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College on recommendation of the Head of the Department of Education and the Senate Committee on Degrees. Students of good moral character who have been graduated from an approved high school and who satisfy the entrance requirements specified by the State Board of Education are eligible for admission if recommended by the school principal. A student who has satisfactorily completed one year of elementary teacher preparation in this State or the first year in a standard normal school or its full equivalent, may be admitted to sophomore standing, pro\u00ad vided the entrance requirements have been met and a satisfactory record presented. Graduates of the former two-year curriculum, if found qualified, may be admitted to the Elementary Education curriculum in Junior standing. Such students will be given a special enrollment supplementing the courses accepted for advanced credit and will be eligible to receive the degree of Bachelor of Education after satisfactory completion of two years of resi\u00ad dent work. The curriculum in Elementary Education may be modified for students who wish a more highly specialized preparation in other approved fields of study. The free electives included in the outlined curriculum usually provide fully for the supplementary majors desired. The requirements for teaching certificates in the elementary schools are gradually increasing. In the future professional advancement will be contingent upon the equivalent of four years of preparation and a bachelor's degree. Successful teachers who have earned a degree and are interested in continuing their training may obtain a plan of study after consultation with the Head of the Department. Students who are unable to spend four consecutive years in preparation for teaching may meet the present minimum for teaching certificates in the elementary schools of Vermont by completing two years of training in this curriculum. In such cases a special two-year enrollment is required and the sequences must be carefully planned in consultation with the Head of the Department of Education. The State Board of Education allows Vermont students an exemption from tuition payment amounting to two hundred dollars a year provided 240 The Curricula the student signs an agreement to teach in Vermont for as long a time as the tuition is re bated. The University now grants a one-hundred dollar scholarship to such students to cover the remainder of the tuition charge of three hundred dollars. These scholarships are subject to University regulations and are not credited to students who are under warning for low scholastic record or who are on probation for any reason. Students who change to another curriculum in the University or who transfer to another institution or who fail to keep the agreement to teach in Vermont become liable to the refund of all the tuition previously rebated.

It is recommended to students who have sufficient train\u00ad ing and natural musical ability to justify a career in music. In order to prepare qualified teachers for positions as instructors and supervisors of music in the public schools of Vermont, qualified students from this State are accepted and trained without tuition charge. Students who were enrolled prior to January 1, 1939, are also charged one-half the established rate for the applied music courses. All students who enroll after that date pay the regular rates for this practical work. Non-resident students who are accepted, pay a tuition charge of one hundred fifty dollars a semester in addition to the charges for applied music. Students must pass the aptitude tests given by the Department of Music and must satisfy the general admission requirements for the Elementary Education curriculum or for some curriculum offered in the College of Arts and Sciences.

The College of Agriculture The College of Agriculture performs three public functions: it teaches, it investigates, it disseminates. These three lines of work are carried out respectively by the College as such, by the Agricultural Experiment Station and by the Agricultural Extension Service. The College as such is supported in part by Federal funds received under the provisions of the Acts of 1862, 1890, 1907 and 1935, known respectively as the first and second Morrill Acts, the Nelson Amendment, and the Bankhead-Jones Act. It offers professional curricula in Agri\u00ad culture and Flome Economics. The Agricultural Experiment Station was established by an act of the State Legislature in 1886. Its activities are supported by sundry Federal and State enactments including the (Federal) Flatch, Adams, Purnell, and Bankhead-Jones Acts of 1887, 1906, 1925 and 1935, and State laws dealing with regulatory work (fertilizer control, feeding stuffs inspection, agricultural seed inspection), and with the conduct of Uni\u00ad versity farm operation and other duties. Its essential duty is to conduct research in Agriculture and Home Economics, to administer certain regulatory statutes, and to publish the results of such work. The Agricultural Extension Service was established by an act of the State Legislature in 1912. It benefits by sundry State and Federal appro\u00ad priations, the latter through the instrumentality of the Smith-Lever Act of 1914, the Capper-Ketcham Act of 1928 and the Bankhead-Jones Act of 193 5. Its especial function is to improve agricultural and home prac\u00ad tice by demonstration and by personal work throughout the State. 250 The Curricula It is an aim of this College to impart to its students in agriculture such theoretical and practical training as will serve to fit them success\u00ad fully to engage in agricultural pursuits, using that term in the widest sense; that is to say, including not only the conduct of operations directly or indirectly related to agriculture, but also of teaching, research or extension in agriculture. While its fundamental concept is to make agriculture and related subjects the main line of effort, the course is broad in its scope and includes mathematics, literature, sciences, and other cultural studies. The technique of the sundry operations is exemplified, so far as time, means and equipment permit, but the emphasis is laid on lectures, textbook assignments and laboratory work more than upon field operations. THE CURRICULA IN AGRICULTURE There are five options of the Agricultural curricula each leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Agriculture. These options are: the Teaching of Agriculture, Plant Industry, Dairy Production, Dairy Manu\u00ad factures, and Agricultural Economics. The total number of semester hours required for the degree is one hundred forty-four for men, ones hundred thirty-six for women. Men are required to complete two courses in Military Science for a total credit of eight semester hours. This credit becomes an integral part of the record and is counted toward graduation. Two years of Physical Education are required of all students. Aside from these subjects, the semester hours for graduation are as follows: cultural or humanistic courses 26, science courses 38, technical agriculture 56, and free electives 12. The first two years are nearly identical in all the five options. AGRICULTURAL CURRICULA THE FRESHMAN YEAR 1ST HF. 2ND HF.

The technical courses deal with the economics of food and clothing, the esthetic and practical aspects of home furnishing, equipment and management, and the importance of the family as a fundamental unit of society. The department operates, as a laboratory for practical experience, a well equipped management house which becomes the home of each student enrolled in this curriculum for a portion of each of the four years. The students are supervised and instructed by a member of the faculty acting as house director and the work is an integral part of several required courses. Some of the courses in Home Economics may be elected by students who are enrolled in the group elective curricula of the College of Arts and Sciences. The four-year curriculum is given in the College of Agriculture. The College of Agriculture 255 HOME ECONOMICS CURRICULUM THE FRESHMAN YEAR 1ST HF. 2ND HF.

For over a century it has served the State and the Nation by sending out its graduates to every part of the Union. The College of Medicine is a member of the Association of American Medical Colleges and is on the approved list of the Council on Medical Education and Hospitals of the American Medical Association. The excellent record of the graduates of this college and the high standing of the institution is, in large measure, the result of the intensive instruc\u00ad tion given in small sections in lecture, laboratory and clinic. OUTLINE OF THE FOUR YEARS' CURRICULUM The curriculum has been arranged so that the study of the several branches of Medicine is taken up in a systematic way. The student is taught first the general structure of the body, its em- bryological development, the functions of the various organs, the chemical processes taking place in the body and the minute structure of the tissues and organs in health. The follows consideration of the changes in gross and microscopic anatomy, the variations in the chemical processes and in the functions of organs and tissues under the influence of disease, how such changes give rise to different symptoms and physical signs and the methods of interpreting such findings in arriving at a diagnosis. The student is then taught the methods of investigating diseases, their causes and prevention, as well as the remedies used in their treatment. The various surgical conditions are considered, the indications for treatment or operations, and the technique of operating. Reproduction and develop\u00ad ment are studied and the diseases of pregnancy as well as the management of labor. Instruction is given by lectures, demonstrations, recitations, practical courses, laboratory work, clinics and clinical teaching at the bedside, in the hospitals, in the Dispensary and in several public State institutions with which the College has connection. For clinical work the class is divided into small sections so that each student receives the personal attention of the instructor. The College of Medicine 257 The work of the hirst Year includes the study of Anatomy, Physiology, Physiological Chemistry, Histology, Embryology and Radiology. The courses in Anatomy and Physiology have been graded to cover two years, the work of each year being practically complete in itself. Laboratory courses are given in Anatomy (dissecting), Histology, Embryology, Physiology and Chemistry. During the Second Year the study of Physiology is completed. Courses are given in Materia Medica, Pharmacology, Pathology, Bacteriology, Surgery, Bandaging, Medicine, Toxicology, Obstetrics, Radiology and Hygiene. Laboratory courses are given in Anatomy, Pathological His\u00ad tology, Clinical Pathology, Physiology and Bacteriology. The work of the Third Year includes Surgery, Obstetrics, Special Pathology, Therapeutics and the various special subjects of Medicine and Surgery. There are practical courses in Physical Diagnosis, Minor Surgery and Obstetrics with the manikin. The students attend surgical and medical clinics, in which they are instructed in the methods of investigating disease, in properly interpreting the symptoms of disease, in the principles of differential diagnosis and in the indications for treatment. The Fourth Year is devoted largely to the study of diagnosis and the treatment of disease, the larger part of the work being given at the gen\u00ad eral hospitals, the Dispensary and under preceptors, where students examine patients, make diagnosis and outline treatment. The class is divided into sections, usually of four students each, which are assigned to various services in rotation. The services include medical, surgical, pathological and specialties at the hospitals; medical, surgical and specialties at the Dispensary, as well as obstetrics and pediatric work at the Elizabeth Lund Home; out-patient service and city physi\u00ad cians; four weeks with a preceptor, a general practitioner in the country, and two weeks of intensive training in each of four public institutions. During this year the students are required to assist at autopsies under the instruction of the Professor of Pathology, and to make such micro\u00ad scopic study of the tissues removed as may be of value in understanding the pathological history of the case. One two-hour period each week is devoted to a clinical conference for which students prepare and present all possible data, clinical and pathological, upon some case which they have studied, usually one which has come to autopsy. These exercises are held under the joint supervision of the departments of Medicine, Surgery and Pathology and cases studied are thoroughly discussed. This conference is attended by the Third Year students as well as by those of the Fourth Year class who are not on Extra-mural Service. 258 The Curricula CLINICAL TEACHING AND FACILITIES The department of clinical teaching is under the direct supervision of the Professors of Medicine and Surgery, who have an able corps of clinical assistants. The work in clinical instruction is thoroughly systematized. In the hospital wards the Senior students, under the direction of an instructor, examine patients, write the history of the cases, make laboratory examina\u00ad tions indicated, make diagnoses, and suggest treatment. The clinical facilities include the Mary Fletcher, Bishop DeGoesbriand, Fort Ethan Allen and Fanny Allen Hospitals with approximately four hundred beds; the Laboratory of the State Board of Health and the Free Dispensary; two orphans' homes with approximately five hundred beds; the Weeks School, Caverly Preventorium, forty-five beds; Vermont Hospital for the Insane, one thousand and fifty beds; Brandon State School, three hun\u00ad dred beds. The facilities of the St. Albans Hospital, and the Retreat at Brattleboro are also available. GRADUATION Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine must have met the requirement of this College in regard to preliminary education and must have attended and satisfactorily completed the prescribed work of four yearly sessions or courses of instruction in Medicine, of at least thirty- two weeks each. On completion of the educational requirements the degree of Doctor of Medicine will be conferred upon candidates of good moral character who are at least twenty-one years old.
