This numbering system is used by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and by participating nonpublic institutions. The major purpose of this system is to facilitate the transfer of courses between participating institutions. Students and administrators can use the online SCNS to obtain course descriptions and specific information about course transfer between participating Florida institutions. This information is at the SCNS website at http://scns.fldoe.org . Each participating institution controls the title, credit, and content of its own courses and recommends the first digit of the course number to indicate the level at which students normally take the course. Course prefixes and the last three digits of the course numbers are assigned by members of faculty discipline committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee. Individuals nominated to serve on these committees are selected to maintain a representative balance as to type of institution and discipline field or specialization. The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a meaning in the SCNS. The listing of prefixes and associated courses is referred to as the \"SCNS taxonomy.\" Descriptions of the content of courses are referred to as \"statewide course profiles.\" EXAMPLE OF COURSE IDENTIFIER GENERAL RULE FOR COURSE EQUIVALENCIES Equivalent courses at different institutions are identified by the same prefixes and same last three digits of the course number and are guaranteed to be transferable between participating institutions that offer the course, with a few exceptions, as listed below in Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency. For example, a freshman composition skills course is offered by 84 different public and nonpublic postsecondary institutions. Each institution uses \"ENC_101\" to identify its freshman composition skills course. The level code is the first digit and represents the year in which students normally take the course at a specific institution. In the SCNS taxonomy, \"ENC\" means \"English Composition,\" the the decade digit \"0\" represents \"Freshman Composition Skills,\" and the unit digit \"1\" represents \"Freshman Composition Skills I.\" In the sciences and certain other areas, a \"C\" or \"L\" after the course number is known as a lab indicator. The \"C\" represents a combined lecture and laboratory course that meets in the same place at the same time. The \"L\" represents a laboratory course or the laboratory part of a course that has the same prefix and course number but meets at a different time or place. Transfer of any successfully completed course from one participating institution to another is guaranteed in cases where the course to be transferred is equivalent to one offered by the receiving institution. Equivalencies are established by the same prefix and last three digits and comparable faculty credentials at both institutions. For example, ENC 1101 is offered at a community college. The same course is offered at a state university as ENC 2101. PREFIX ENC English CompositionLEVEL CODE (first digit) 1 Lower (Freshman) Level at this institutionCENTURY DIGIT (second digit) 1 Freshman Composition DECADE DIGIT (third digit) 0 Freshman Composition SkillsUNIT DIGIT (fourth digit) 1 Freshman Composition Skills ILAB CODE No Laboratory component in this course Transfer Students and Credits128 Transfer Students and CreditsA student who has successfully completed ENC 1101 at a Florida College System institution is guaranteed to receive transfer credit for ENC 2101 at the state university if the student transfers. The student cannot be required to take ENC 2101 again since ENC 1101 is equivalent to ENC 2101. Transfer credit must be awarded for successfully completed equivalent courses and used by the receiving institution to determine satisfaction of requirements by transfer students on the same basis as credit awarded to the native students. It is the prerogative of the receiving institution, however, to offer transfer credit for courses successfully completed that have not been designated as equivalent. NOTE: Credit generated at institutions on the quarter-term system may not transfer the equivalent number of credits to institutions on the semester-term system. For example, 4.0 quarter hours often transfers as 2.67 semester hours. THE COURSE PREFIX The course prefix is a three-letter designator for a major division of an academic discipline, subject matter area, or subcategory of knowledge. The prefix is not intended to identify the department in which a course is offered. Rather, the content of a course determines the assigned prefix to identify the course. AUTHORITY FOR ACCEPTANCE OF EQUIVALENT COURSES Section 1007.24(7), Florida Statutes, states: \"Any student who transfers among postsecondary institutions that are fully accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education and that participate in the statewide course numbering system shall be awarded credit by the receiving institution for courses satisfactorily completed by the student at the previous institutions. Credit shall be awarded if the courses are judged by the appropriate statewide course numbering system faculty committees representing school districts, public postsecondary educational institutions, and participating nonpublic postsecondary educational institutions to be academically equivalent to courses offered at the receiving institution, including equivalency of faculty credentials, regardless of the public or nonpublic control of the previous institution. The Department of Education shall ensure that credits to be accepted by a receiving institution are generated in courses for which the faculty possess credentials that are comparable to those required by the accrediting association of the receiving institution. The award of credit may be limited to courses that are entered in the statewide course numbering system. Credits awarded pursuant to this subsection shall satisfy institutional requirements on the same basis as credits awarded to native students.\" EXCEPTIONS TO THE GENERAL RULE FOR EQUIVALENCY Since the initial implementation of the SCNS, specific disciplines or types of courses have been excepted from the guarantee of transfer for equivalent courses. These include courses that must be evaluated individually or courses in which the student must be evaluated for mastery of skill and technique. The following courses are exceptions to the general rule for course equivalencies and may not transfer. Transferability is at the discretion of the receiving institution. A. Courses not offered by the receiving institution. B. For courses at nonregionally accredited institutions, courses offered prior to the established transfer date of the course in question. \"Monday I embark on a new journey, as I will be taking on the role of General Manager for the first time in my professional career for a Holiday Inn Express here in Florida.

These courses need evidence of achievement (e.g., portfolio, audition, interview, etc.). COURSES AT NONREGIONALLY ACCREDITED INSTITUTIONS The SCNS makes available on its home page ( http://scns.fldoe.org ) a report entitled \"Courses at Nonregionally Accredited Institutions\" that contains a comprehensive listing of all nonpublic institution courses in the SCNS inventory, as well as each course's transfer level and transfer effective date. This report is updated monthly.

POLICIES GRADING POLICY Students in all programs are awarded letter grades for work completed at Everglades University. Academic work is evaluated and grades are assigned at the end of each class (month) in order to indicate a student's level of performance. The individual criteria upon which the student's performance are evaluated are distributed to students at the beginning of each course. Grades are based on the quality of a student's work as shown by recitation, written tests, lab assignments, class projects, and homework/outside assignments. The meaning of the grade notations is based on a four-point scale: UNDERGRADUATE LETTER GRADE INTERPRETATION QUALITY POINT NUMERIC GRADE A Excellent 4.0 90-100% B Good 3.0 80-89% C Average 2.0 70-79% D Poor 1.0 60-69% F Failing 0.0 Up to 60% AU Audit Not Computed *I Incomplete Not Computed *IC Incomplete/COVID-19 Not Computed W Withdrew Not Computed (T of course completion) WCO Not Pass Not Computed T Transfer Credit Not Computed TEU Transfer Credit from within EU Not Computed * Students receiving an Incomplete grade (I) in any subject will meet with the instructor to discuss ** Students taking a leave due to COVID-19 qualifying events may elect to take an IC grade (Incomplete due to COVID-19). Students are expected to complete outstanding work for the course from which they withdrew within 30 days of their return from the leave.

These arrangements must be completed within a stated time frame from the end of the course. Failure to make such arrangements, without administrative approval, will result in the grade indicated by the faculty member on the Incomplete Grade Contract. ** Students taking a leave due to COVID-19 qualifying events may elect to take an IC grade (Incomplete due to COVID-19). Students are expected to complete outstanding work for the course from which they withdrew within 30 days of their return from the leave. Grades and reports of a student's progress may be mailed, posted, or given to the student at the end of each semester. Students may request an unofficial copy of their grade history at any time. UNDERGRADUATE SCHOLASTIC HONORS The Dean's List is published at the end of each semester and lists students who have earned six or more credits and maintained a grade point average of 3.75 - 4.00. The Honor Roll is published at the end of each semester and lists all students who have earned at least six credit hours and maintained a grade point average of 3.50 - 3.74. GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES General education is a component of each Everglades University undergraduate degree program. Everglades University's general education curriculum is designed to emphasize the ability to think and read critically, to communicate effectively both in writing and in speech, and to understand quantitative data. Instead of focusing narrowly on skills, techniques and procedures specific to a particular occupation or profession, these courses help students to develop a critical appreciation of both the value and the limitations of methods of inquiry and analysis. General education courses provide an opportunity for students to achieve a collegiate level of literacy in the humanities, the social and behavioral sciences, and the natural sciences and mathematics. At Everglades University, general education includes the knowledge, skills and perspectives that become part of an educational experience of all undergraduates regardless of major. A college education helps students begin a career. It should also help students become well-rounded individuals. Upon completing the general education curriculum, undergraduate students are required to complete the ETS Proficiency Profile. Failure to complete these assessments may result in a hold being placed on the student's diploma. Policies 135MAKE-UP WORK POLICY AND REPEATING COURSES I CONTRACT POLICY Students who are unable to complete required work by the end of a term may be granted an Incomplete grade (I) with the instructor's approval. This make-up work policy is granted on a case-by-case basis. Arrangements must be completed within a stated time frame from the end of the course. GRADUATE REPEATED COURSE POLICY Graduate students must receive a grade of \"C\" or above in all courses needed toward degree completion. A graduate course in which an \"F\" has been earned must be repeated until a satisfactory letter grade (e.g., \"A\", \"B\", \"C\") has been achieved as long as the student maintains Satisfactory Academic Progress. Students are financially responsible to pay for any courses repeated. Any student retaking any course must schedule a meeting with their financial aid representative to discuss impacts on their funding. UNDERGRADUATE REPEATED COURSE POLICY Undergraduate students must complete all required courses in their program with passing grades (e.g., \"A\", \"B\", \"C\",\"D\") to graduate. A course in which a satisfactory letter grade (e.g., \"A\", \"B\", \"C\") has been earned may not be repeated for grade point average purposes. A course in which a letter grade of \"D\" has been earned may be retaken for grade point average purposes. A course in which a \"D\" grade has been earned may be taken no more than three times. Before attempting to retake a course in which a \"D\" grade was earned, students should speak to their financial aid representative. A course in which a letter grade of \"F\" has been earned must be repeated until a passing grade has been earned, but the course may not be taken more than three times. A student wishing to take a course more than three times has the right to file a complaint/grievance as disclosed in the Student Disciplinary/Complaint/Grievance Procedures section of the catalog. When a student repeats a course because of failure, both the original and the subsequent grades are recorded on the official university transcript; however, only the passing grade is included in the grade point calculation at Everglades University. No courses may be repeated for grade point average purposes after graduation. Students are financially responsible to pay for any courses repeated. Any student retaking any course must schedule a meeting with their financial aid representative to discuss impacts on their funding. CLASS SIZE The average number of students in a typical class is less than 20 with a maximum of 45. The philosophy and practice at Everglades University is to provide maximum individual attention and quality instruction for every student. ATTENDANCE AND TARDINESS At Everglades University, satisfactory attendance is considered a vital part of each student's performance. Absences in excess of twenty-five (25) percent of class hours for any subject may cause a student to be ineligible to take the final examination in that subject. A student may be reinstated to classes following an evaluation of his/her abilities and performance by an instructor, Dean of Academic Affairs, or Associate Dean. Such determinations are made on a case-by-case basis. Excessive absences may also result in the following administrative actions: academic warning, probation, student suspension, student termination and cancellation or termination of student financial aid. In an emergency which causes a student to be absent, it is the student's responsibility to make arrangements with the instructor to complete missed work. Habitual tardiness or excessive absences, excused or unexcused, will result in a reduction of the final grade or dismissal if unsatisfactory progress is evident. Students who are tardy to class are docked for the time they were not in class. This amount will accrue towards the maximum absentee amount allowed of (25) percent. Policies136 TITLE IX COMPLIANCE Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 protects individuals from discrimination based on sexual orientation in education programs or activities which receive Federal financial assistance. Everglades University not only complies with the letter of Title IX's requirements but also endorses the law's intent and spirit. The University is committed to compliance in all areas addressed by Title IX, including access to higher education, career education, math and science, standardized testing, athletics, education for pregnant and parenting students, learning environment, and technology, as well as sexual harassment. All University students are responsible to make certain that sexual discrimination, sexual violence or sexual harassment does not occur. If you feel that you have experienced or witnessed sexual harassment or sexual violence, you should notify either the Title IX Coordinator or Title IX Responsible Employees designated below. Everglades University forbids retaliation against anyone for reporting harassment, assisting in making a harassment complaint, or cooperating in a harassment investigation; it is also a violation of Federal law. Additional details on this policy can be found at the following under the heading \"Title IX Resources\". A copy of the primary prevention and awareness program is also available at the above link under the heading \"Primary Prevention & Awareness Program\". Title IX Coordinator: Jared Bezet, Vice President of Academic Affairs, 5002 T-Rex Avenue, Suite 100, Boca Raton, FL 33431 Title IX Responsible Employees: Campus Response T eam (CRT) members are Title IX responsible employees. CRT members are identified by their CRT lanyard, and each CRT member has a hand held radio. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS- UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS Students at Everglades University are expected to maintain satisfactory academic progress and to make ongoing progress toward graduation. There are two standards that must be met: a qualitative standard and a quantitative standard. The qualitative standard requires that a student achieve a minimum grade point average of 1.7 after completing his/ her first semester at Everglades University. All students must achieve a minimum grade point average of 2.0 for the second semester and must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 in order to graduate from Everglades University. A student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 2.0 is placed on financial aid warning for the next semester. While on financial aid warning, a student remains eligible for Title IV financial aid funds. A student on financial aid warning who brings his/her cumulative grade point average to 2.0 is removed from financial aid warning. A student who earns a 2.0 grade point average for a semester without attaining a cumulative 2.0 while on financial aid warning is allowed to remain in school. While on financial aid warning, a student not earning a 2.0 grade point average by the end of the semester must appeal to continue on Financial Probation, a student who fails to appeal or whose appeal is not accepted by the University will have financial aid terminated. Everglades University students are entitled to fair processes and procedures. Students have the right to appeal by filing a Student Satisfactory Academic Progress Grievance as disclosed in the Student Disciplinary/Complaint/ Grievance Procedures section of the catalog (page 171). A student must submit a written request with appropriate documentation to the Grievance Panel as described in the Student Disciplinary/Complaint/Grievance Procedures section of the catalog. The student appeal must be based on mitigating circumstances. These include serious illness or injury of a student or serious illness, injury or death of a student's immediate family member, or other special circumstances. The appeal must also include an explanation as to what has changed in the student's situation that will allow him/her to make satisfactory academic progress in the returning semester. If an appeal is granted, the student may be placed on one payment period of Financial Aid Probation and must meet Satisfactory Academic Progress by Policies 137the end of the payment period of Financial Aid Probation unless the student can demonstrate progress in an agreed upon Academic Plan. Students may receive Title IV aid while on Financial Aid Probation. A student returning on Financial Aid Probation following an appeal must minimally meet the qualitative standard of a 2.0 or demonstrate progress per the Academic Plan which includes no less than a 2.0 GPA at the end of the returning semester. A student returning from Financial Aid Probation, who fails to meet the qualitative standard at the end of the returning semester, becomes ineligible for Title IV aid and is dismissed from the University with the status of Financial Aid Dismissal. The quantitative standard requires students to complete their program of study within 150% of the normal timeframe allotted for completion of the program. Transfer credit hours, repeated courses, and all attempted courses that meet degree requirements are considered in the determination of this 150% normal time frame, although not in computation of grade point average. The normal timeframe is measured in credit hours attempted (rather than semesters) to accommodate schedules of full-time and part-time students. In order to ensure completion of a program within the maximum timeframe, Everglades University requires students to successfully complete 67% (rounded using common round half up rule) of credit hours attempted the first semester and each semester thereafter. Academic year is two semesters. If a student withdraws from a course, the credit hours of that course are included in determining the quantitative standard of satisfactory academic progress. All students must have completed a minimum of 67% of credit hours attempted in order to graduate within 150% of the normal timeframe. A student whose cumulative completion rate falls below 67% at the end of the first semester or any subsequent semester is placed on financial aid warning for the next semester. While on financial aid warning, a student remains eligible for Title IV financial aid funds. A student who completes 67% of credit hours attempted in a semester while on financial aid warning is allowed to remain in school. A student on financial aid warning who brings his/her completion rate to 67% is removed from financial aid warning. A student on financial aid warning who does not complete 67% of the credits attempted by the end of the semester must appeal to continue on Financial Probation, a student who fails to appeal or whose appeal is not accepted by the University will have financial aid terminated. Everglades University students are entitled to fair processes and procedures. Dismissed students have the right to appeal this by filing a Student Satisfactory Academic Progress Grievance as disclosed in the Student Disciplinary/Complaint/Grievance Procedures section of the catalog (page 171). A student must submit a written request with appropriate documentation to the Grievance Panel as described in the Student Disciplinary/Complaint/ Grievance Procedures section of the catalog. The student appeal must be based on mitigating circumstances. These include serious illness or injury of a student or serious illness, injury or death of a student's immediate family member, or other special circumstances. The appeal must also include an explanation as to what has changed in the student's situation that will allow him/her to make satisfactory academic progress in the returning semester. If an appeal is granted, the student may be placed on one payment period of Financial Aid Probation and must meet Satisfactory Academic Progress by the end of the payment period of Financial Aid Probation unless the student can demonstrate progress in an agreed upon Academic Plan. Students may receive Title IV aid while on Financial Aid Probation. A student returning on Financial Aid Probation following an appeal must minimally meet the quantitative standard of completing 67% or more of credit hours attempted at the end of the returning semester. A student returning from Financial Aid Probation who fails to meet the quantitative standard of completing 67% or more of credit hours attempted at the end of the returning semester, becomes ineligible for Title IV aid and is dismissed from the University with the status of Financial Aid Dismissal. Policies138 A course that receives a grade of \"W\" for a course withdrawal or a grade of \"I\" for an incomplete will be evaluated as a non-completed course. These non-completed courses will be calculated into the quantitative Satisfactory Academic Progress standards. A course that receives a falling grade of \"F\" will be calculated into both the qualitative and quantitative Satisfactory Academic Progress standards. When a student repeats a course because of failure, both the original and the subsequent grades are recorded on the official university transcript; however, only the passing grade is included in the grade point calculation, both grades are counted towards the cumulative completion or quantitative standard. A course that receives a grade of \"WNA\" for a course withdrawal- no attendance will be evaluated as a non-completed course and will not be calculated into either the qualitative or quantitative Satisfactory Academic Progress standards. These standards apply to all students (those receiving veterans' benefits, those receiving financial aid and cash-paying students). The Veterans' Administration is notified of unsatisfactory progress of a veteran student who remains on financial aid warning beyond two consecutive semesters. At that point, Veterans Benefits can be terminated. A student terminated from Veterans Benefits due to unsatisfactory progress may be recertified for benefits upon attaining a 2.0 cumulative grade average. SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS- GRADUATE STUDENTS Students at Everglades University are expected to maintain satisfactory academic progress and to make ongoing progress toward graduation. There are two standards that must be met: a qualitative standard and a quantitative standard. The qualitative standard requires that a student achieve a minimum grade point average 3.0 for the first semester and must maintain a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0 in order to graduate from Everglades University. A student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0 is placed on financial aid warning for the next semester. While on financial aid warning, a student remains eligible for Title IV financial aid funds. A student on financial aid warning who brings his/her cumulative grade point average to 3.0 is removed from financial aid warning. A student who earns a 3.0 grade point average for a semester without attaining a cumulative 3.0 while on financial aid warning is allowed to remain in school. While on financial aid warning, a student not earning a 3.0 grade point average by the end of the semester must appeal to continue on Financial Probation, a student who fails to appeal or whose appeal is not accepted by the University will have financial aid terminated. Everglades University students are entitled to fair processes and procedures. Students have the right to appeal by filing a Student Satisfactory Academic Progress Grievance as disclosed in the Student Disciplinary/ Complaint/Grievance Procedures section of the catalog (page 171). A student must submit a written request with appropriate documentation to the Grievance Panel as described in the Student Disciplinary/Complaint/Grievance Procedures section of the catalog. The student appeal must be based on mitigating circumstances. These include serious illness or injury of a student or serious illness, injury or death of a student's immediate family member, or other special circumstances. The appeal must also include an explanation as to what has changed in the student's situation that will allow him/her to make satisfactory academic progress in the returning semester. If an appeal is granted, the student may be placed on one payment period of Financial Aid Probation and must meet Satisfactory Academic Progress by the end of the payment period of Financial Aid Probation unless the student can demonstrate progress in an agreed upon Academic Plan. Students may receive Title IV aid while on Financial Aid Probation. A student returning on Financial Aid Probation following an appeal must minimally meet the qualitative standard of a 3.0 or demonstrate progress per the Academic Plan which includes no less than a 3.0 GPA at the end of the returning semester. A student returning from Financial Aid Probation, who fails to meet the qualitative standard at the end of the returning semester, becomes ineligible for Title IV aid and is dismissed from the University with the status of Financial Aid Dismissal. Policies 139The quantitative standard requires students to complete their program of study within 150% of the normal timeframe allotted for completion of the program. Transfer credit hours, repeated courses, and all attempted courses that meet degree requirements are considered in the determination of this 150% normal time frame, although not in computation of grade point average. In order to ensure completion of a program within the maximum timeframe, Everglades University requires students to successfully complete 67% (rounded using common round half up rule) of credit hours attempted each semester. If a student withdraws from a course, the credit hours of that course are included in determining the quantitative standard of satisfactory academic progress. All students must have completed a minimum of 67% of credit hours attempted in order to graduate within 150% of the normal timeframe. A student whose cumulative completion rate falls below 67% at the end of the first semester or any subsequent semester is placed on financial aid warning for the next semester. While on financial aid warning, a student remains eligible for Title IV financial aid funds. A student who completes 67% of credit hours attempted in a semester while on financial aid warning is allowed to remain in school. A student on financial aid warning who brings his/her completion rate to 67% is removed from financial aid warning. A student on financial aid warning who does not complete 67% of the credits attempted by the end of the semester must appeal to continue on Financial Probation, a student who fails to appeal or whose appeal is not accepted by the University will have financial aid terminated. Everglades University students are entitled to fair processes and procedures.

If an appeal is granted, the student may be placed on one payment period of Financial Aid Probation and must meet Satisfactory Academic Progress by the end of the payment period of Financial Aid Probation unless the student can demonstrate progress in an agreed upon Academic Plan. Students may receive Title IV aid while on Financial Aid Probation. A student returning on Financial Aid Probation following an appeal is eligible for Title IV aid and must minimally meet the quantitative standard of completing 67% or more of credit hours attempted at the end of the returning semester. A student returning from Financial Aid Probation who fails to meet the quantitative standard of completing 67% or more of credit hours attempted at the end of the returning semester, becomes ineligible for Title IV aid and is dismissed from the University with the status of Financial Aid Dismissal. A course that receives a grade of \"W\" for a course withdrawal or a grade of an \"I\" for an incomplete will be evaluated as a non-completed course. These non-completed courses will be calculated into the quantitative Satisfactory Academic Progress standards. A course that receives a non-passing grade of \"D\" or \"F\" will be calculated into both the qualitative and quantitative Satisfactory Academic Progress standards. When a student repeats a course because of failure, both the original and the subsequent grades are recorded on the official university transcript; however, only the passing grade is included in the grade point calculation, both grades are counted towards the cumulative completion or quantitative standard.

MAXIMUM TIME FOR PROGRAM COMPLETION Students are expected to complete all courses leading to a degree as they are scheduled in sequence. Under unusual circumstances, the University President or Vice President may authorize additional time to allow a student the opportunity to satisfy graduation requirements. Under no condition will a student be allowed to extend the time needed to graduate beyond the maximum time frame of one-and-one-half times the standard program length (150%). Students who fail to meet this educational objective will be ineligible for financial aid and all financial disbursements must be terminated.

ASSESSMENT TESTING As part of Everglades University's ongoing commitment to student learning outcomes, the Department of Institutional Effectiveness facilitates the administration of nationally recognized examinations to students. These tests include, but are not limited to the ETS Proficiency Profile, which is an integrated test of general education skills and is mandatory for all undergraduate students, and the Peregrine Assessment, an assessment of business skills and knowledge that is mandatory for graduate and undergraduate business students. These assessments enable Everglades University's faculty and academic administrators to evaluate and improve the quality of Everglades University's educational programs. Completion of these assessments is mandatory; noncompletion of these assessments may result in holds being placed on student transcripts or diplomas. Additionally, students are periodically requested to complete surveys administered through the Institutional Effectiveness office. Information is collected on student experience with courses, instructors, programs, and campus staff and services. The information collected in these surveys is essential to the University's efforts to provide continuous improvement of its services and curriculum. Noncompletion of certain surveys may result in students' being unable to access their courses or other services. ACADEMIC INTEGRITY ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY The University can best function and accomplish its mission in an atmosphere of high ethical standards. As such, the University expects students to observe all accepted principles of academic honesty. Academic honesty in the advancement of knowledge requires that students respect the integrity of one another's work and recognize the importance of acknowledging and safeguarding the validity of intellectual property. Students are expected to maintain complete honesty and integrity in all academic work attempted while enrolled at the University. Academic dishonesty is a serious violation of the trust upon which an academic community depends. There are different forms of academic dishonesty including, but not limited to, the following: Acquiring or Providing Information Dishonestly: Using unauthorized notes or other study aids during an examination; using unauthorized technology during an examination; improper storage of prohibited notes, course materials and study aids during an exam such that they are accessible or possible to view; looking at other students' work during an exam or in an assignment where collaboration is not allowed; attempting to communicate with other students in order to get help during an exam or in an assignment where collaboration is not allowed; obtaining an examination prior to its administration; altering graded work and submitting it for re-grading; allowing another person to do one's work and submitting it as one's own; or undertaking any activity intended to obtain an unfair advantage over other students. PLAGIARISM The deliberate or unintentional use of another's words or ideas without proper citation for which the student claims authorship. It is a policy of Everglades University that students assume responsibility for maintaining honesty in all work submitted for credit and in any other work designated by an instructor of a course. Students may not submit the same work completed for one course in any other course, earning credit for the same work each time. Plagiarism, because it is a form of theft and dishonesty that interferes with the goals of education, must carry severe penalties. The penalties are as follows: Academic Integrity142 Partially Plagiarized Assignments: The first occurrence of a student turning in an assignment containing plagiarized material results in an automatic \"F\" for that assignment. The second occurrence of a student turning in an assignment containing plagiarized material results in an automatic \"F\" for the course. The third occurrence of a student turning in an assignment containing plagiarized material results in an automatic dismissal from the University. Entirely Plagiarized Assignments The first occurrence of a student turning in an entire plagiarized assignment results in an automatic \"F\" for the course. The second occurrence of a student turning in an entire plagiarized assignment results in an automatic dismissal from the University. Students who have been dismissed may reapply to Everglades University after remaining out of school for one full semester. Everglades University believes strongly that each student against whom the University is forced to take action, has a right to procedural due process where the student has notice and an opportunity to be heard. If the administration has to take disciplinary measures against a student or other action related to the student, the student may appeal the decision to the Grievance Committee. The procedures for the grievance are found in the Everglades University catalog. On written papers for which the student employs information gathered from books, articles, electronic, or oral sources, each direct quotation, as well as ideas and facts that are not generally known to the public at large, or the form, structure, or style of a secondary source must be attributed to its author by means of the appropriate citation procedure. Only widely known facts and first-hand thoughts and observations original to the student do not require citations. Citations may be made in footnotes or within the body of the text. Plagiarism also consists of passing off as one's own, segments or the total of another's work. Students who have been dismissed may reapply to Everglades University after remaining out of school for one full semester. Everglades University believes strongly that each student against whom the University is forced to take action, has a right to procedural due process where the student has notice and an opportunity to be heard. If the administration has to take disciplinary measures against a student or other action related to the student, the student may appeal the decision to the Grievance Committee. The procedures for the grievance are found in the Everglades University catalog. At Everglades University, references are cited in accordance with the American Psychological Association (APA) approved format.

Conspiracy: Agreeing with one or more persons to commit any act of academic dishonesty. Fraudulent Behavior: Fraudulent behavior includes sharing one's confidential login information with another person, which can also be an instance of misrepresenting oneself. In addition, allowing another student to participate in class assignments under your name and submitting work under another student's name constitute violations of academic integrity. Academic Integrity 143Fabrication of Information: Falsifying or inventing any information, citation, or data; using improper methods of collecting or generating data and presenting them as legitimate; misrepresenting oneself or one's status in the University; perpetrating hoaxes unbecoming to students in good standing or potentially damaging to the University's reputation or that of the members of its academic community of students and scholars. Multiple Submissions: Submitting the same work for credit in two different courses without the instructor's permission. Facilitating Academic Dishonesty: Aiding another person in an act that violates the standards of academic honesty; allowing other students to look at one's own work during an exam or in an assignment where collaboration is not allowed; providing information, material, or assistance to another person knowing that it may be used in violation of course, departmental, or University academic honesty policies; providing false information in connection with any academic honesty inquiry. Abuse or Denying Others Access to Information or Resource Materials: Any act that maliciously hinders the use of or access to library or course materials; the removing of pages from books or journals or reserve materials; the removal of books from libraries without formally checking out the items; the intentional hiding of library materials; the refusal to return reserve readings to the library; or obstructing or interfering with another student's academic work. All of these acts are dishonest and harmful to the community. Falsifying Records and Official Documents: Forging signatures or falsifying information on official academic documents such as drop/add forms, incomplete forms, petitions, letters of permission, or any other official University document. Disclosure of Confidential Information (if applicable to major): A high, responsible standard of conduct and professionalism is expected from each student. Students are personally accountable for the way in which patient information and other confidential information in clinical facilities is utilized. Confidential information is never to be discussed with anyone other than those directly involved in the care of the patient or in the legitimate use of other confidential agency information. Those having access to patient, salary, or associate information should never browse such information out of \"curiosity.\" It is to be used and accessed only for legitimate, clinical/learning purposes. A breach in confidentiality which involves discussing and/or releasing confidential patient or facility information, or obtaining unauthorized system access, will lead to disciplinary action from Everglades University. Each student must seriously evaluate his/her daily use of confidential patient or facility information to assure its proper use. When in doubt, students should seek clarification or direction from their immediate supervisor. SANCTIONS FOR VIOLATING THE ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY After determining that the student has violated the Academic Integrity Policy, the instructor may impose one of the following sanctions (please note: separate sanctions apply to Plagiarism as described above): The first occurrence of academic dishonesty will result in a grade of \"F\" for the assignment or examination. The second occurrence of academic dishonesty will result in a grade of \"F\" for the course. The third occurrence of academic dishonesty will result in dismissal from the University. All progressive disciplinary measures described above are cumulative throughout the program and not limited to occurrences within a specific course or term. Students who have been dismissed may reapply to Everglades University after remaining out of school for one full semester.

If the student decides to withdraw from the class, a grade of \"WM\" will be earned, and the class will be retaken upon return to the University. The \"WM\" grade will not affect the student's satisfactory academic progress (SAP) due to Military Deployment. Military & Veteran Services 153If the withdrawal is during the semester, no withdrawal fee will be charged. If the student was activated during a term, that term, and the remaining semester, will not incur any charges. Upon re-entry, admissions fees will be waived with copy of military orders. All other admissions and academics requirements will be applicable. Service members, Reservists, and Guard members will be readmitted to their program of study if SAP was being made prior to suspending their studies due to service obligations. Policy on Class Absences Due to Military Service: Students shall not be penalized for class absence due to unavoidable or legitimate required military obligations not to exceed two (2) weeks unless special permission is granted by the Dean. Absence due to short-term military duty in the National Guard or Active Reserve is recognized as an excused absence. T o validate such an absence, the student must present evidence to the Dean's office. The Dean will then notify the student's faculty for the term. Students are not to be penalized if absent from an examination, lecture, laboratory, clinicals, or other class activity because of an excused military absence. However, students are fully responsible for all material presented during their absence, and faculty are required to provide opportunities, for students to make up examinations and other work missed because of an excused absence. The faculty member is responsible to provide reasonable alternate assignment(s), as applicable, and/or opportunities to make up exams, clinicals, or other course assignments that have an impact on the course grade.

STUDENT WITHDRAWALS It is the responsibility of all students upon withdrawal from Everglades University to return library books, pay all fines, fees and monies that are owed to the University. CANCELLATION AND REFUND POLICY TUITION AND FEE DISCLOSURE Tuition is computed on the assumption that a student remains throughout the academic year. Since a place in class has been reserved for each student, tuition is refunded in accordance with the University refund policy. A student withdrawing from the University must comply with proper clearance procedures as outlined in the catalog. Reductions in indebtedness are made solely at the discretion of the University for withdrawals necessitated by conditions beyond a student's control such as an emergency acceptable to the University. Refunds or reductions in indebtedness are processed after all required approvals are documented on a withdrawal form. Students are obligated for all charges (tuition/fees/books/supplies) for the semester they are currently attending plus any prior account balance. A semester of sixteen (16) weeks consists of four (4) consecutive four (4) week terms of instruction. A $100 administrative fee is charged when a student withdraws prior to the end of a semester. A student who has withdrawn and wishes to re-enter is charged a $150 reentry fee. Students who change their start date after signing an enrollment agreement may be charged a $75 change of start date fee. RETURN OF TITLE IV FUNDS (R2T4) The requirements for federal financial aid when a student withdraws are separate from the Institutional Refund Policy. As such a student may still owe a balance to the University for unpaid institutional charges. Federal regulations specify how the University must determine the amount of Federal financial aid the student is entitled to have earned when a student withdraws from the University. The percentage amount of Federal financial aid a student has earned during a payment period is calculated based on the total number of calendar days completed in a payment period divided by the total number of calendar days in the payment period. For students who withdraw during the payment period the school will perform the return calculation on a payment period basis. An academic year is defined as two semester's equivalent to 32 weeks of instruction and at least 24 semester hours. In a program offered in modules for any student who withdraws on or after July 1, 2021, a student is not considered to have withdrawn if the student meets one of the following exceptions: 1. One module that includes 49 percent or more of the number of days in the payment period, excluding scheduled breaks of five or more consecutive days and all days between modules; or 2. A combination of modules that when combined contain 49 percent or more of the number of days in the payment period, excluding scheduled breaks of five or more consecutive days and all days between modules; or 3. Coursework equal to or greater than the coursework required for the institution's definition of a half-time student under \u00a7 668.2 for the payment period If the student does not meet one of the 3 R2T4 exceptions described above, the College will perform a Return to Title IV calculation (R2T4) to determine the amount of FSA funds the student has earned at the time of withdrawal. This is calculated based on the total number of calendar days completed divided by the total number of calendar days in the semester/payment period. Tuition and Fees Cancellation and Refund Policy158 The amount of assistance earned is determined on a pro-rata basis. For example, if you completed 30% of your payment period, you earn 30% of the FSA assistance you were originally scheduled to receive. Once you have completed more than 60% of the payment period, you may earn all the FSA assistance you were scheduled to receive for that period. Anytime a student begins attendance in at least one course, but does not begin attendance in all the courses he or she was scheduled to attend, regardless of whether the student is a withdrawal or graduate, the institution must review to see if it is necessary to recalculate the student's eligibility for funding received based on a revised enrollment status and the cost of education. CANCELLATION/WITHDRAWAL CALCULATION Cancellation at any time from the date of a student's registration to the day before the first scheduled day of a semester - 100% refund of tuition and education fees. (The University retains the $50 application fee). Withdrawal at any time during the first week of the semester - 90% refund of tuition only. Withdrawal at any time during the second week of the semester - 85% refund of tuition only. Withdrawal at any time during the third week of the semester - 80% refund of tuition only. Withdrawal at any time during the fourth week of the semester - no refund. Any funds paid for supplies, books or equipment which can be and are returned to the University, are refunded to a student who withdraws prior to the start of a semester, providing the student returns said items that can be resold. The University reserves the right to determine if above-mentioned items are returnable. All registration fees are refunded if a student is not accepted into his/her particular program. Students must notify the University of cancellation by contacting their Academic Advisor in writing or orally when written communication is not possible. All monies paid by an applicant are refunded if cancellation occurs within three business days after signing the University's Application for Admission and making an initial payment. If cancellation occurs after three business days from the signing of the University's Application for Admission , all application and registration fees in excess of $100 are refunded to the student. Refunds are made within thirty days from the date of determination of a student's withdrawal. All balances owed the University due to the return of Title IV funds or withdrawal calculation or a balance due at time of graduation are billed to the student. No official academic transcript is issued to any student who owes a balance to the University at the time of the request. Upon payment of an outstanding debt, a transcript may be issued. Students must notify the University of cancellation by contacting the Dean of Academic Affairs or the Campus Vice President in writing or orally when written communication is not possible.

The institution discloses under CFR 86.100 information related to Everglades University's drug prevention program. The Consumer Information located on Everglades University's website provides a description of this program and a security report. Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Programs: As required by CFR 86.100 Everglades University publishes and distributes to all current students and employees its Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program. Below are the details related to this important subject matter. The University's Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention Program is reviewed annually as part of the Crisis Response T eam's review of campus crime statistics and drug and alcohol offenses to determine its effectiveness and to implement changes if they are needed. Drug and Alcohol Abuse Prevention: Drug abuse affects all aspects of American life. It threatens the workplace, our homes, our schools and our Administrative Policies Administrative Policies162 community. The U.S. Department of Education requires institutions of higher education to implement a drug prevention and awareness program for their students and employees through the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act. All students are expected to conduct themselves as mature adults and as members of an academic community. The consumption of alcohol or drugs while attending class is prohibited and may be subject to disciplinary action. Standards of Conduct: The University community must adhere to a code of conduct that recognizes the unlawful manufacture, sale, delivery, unauthorized possession or use of any illicit drug is prohibited on property owned or otherwise controlled by Everglades University. If an individual associated with the University is apprehended for violating any drug-or alcohol-related law when on University property, or participating in a University activity, the University will fully cooperate with all law enforcement agencies. Underage possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages is not permitted on property owned or controlled by the University and the state laws will be enforced. Intentionally or knowingly selling, or intentionally or knowingly furnishing alcoholic beverages to persons under the age of 21, or to persons obviously inebriated, is not permitted on property owned or controlled by the University. Health Risks Associated with the use of Illicit Drugs and the Abuse of Alcohol: Moderate to high doses of alcohol cause marked impairments in higher mental functions and the loss of memory. High doses of alcohol can cause respiratory depression and death. Long-term consumption, particularly when combined with poor nutrition, can also lead to dependence and permanent damage to vital organs such as the brain and the liver. Physical effects of drugs include increased heart rate, bloodshot eyes, dry mouth and throat, and increased appetite. The use of drugs may impair or reduce short-term memory and comprehension, alter sense of time, and reduce the ability to perform tasks requiring concentration and coordination. Motivation and cognition may also be altered making the acquisition of new information difficult. As you can see from the above there are major health risks associated with the use of illicit drugs and the abuse of alcohol. Drug and Alcohol Counseling: Available to all students is the 211 Helpline Center. Students can call 211 to receive referrals to local resources and support to individuals who need drug and alcohol counseling. Institutional Sanctions for Alcohol and Drug Violations: Any member of the University community found consuming or selling drugs on University property shall be subject to discipline on a case-by-case basis. Discipline will be based on the seriousness of the situation. A case may result in dismissal from the University. In all cases, the University will abide by local, state and federal sanctions regarding unlawful possession of drugs and the consumption of alcohol. Additional state penalties and sanctions may also apply. The University has adopted a zero-tolerance policy regarding underage drinking. Florida Laws on Underage Drinking: While many of the laws across the U.S. concerning underage drinking are similar, it is important to know what your specific laws concerning this crime are. In the state of Florida, the following laws dictate underage penalizations: It is unlawful for a person under 21 years of age to have an alcoholic beverage in his or her possession. This is a second degree misdemeanor. It is unlawful for a person under 21 years of age to consume alcohol. If a minor is found to be driving a vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of .02 or above, he or she can be charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. If a minor is found guilty of committing the above crimes they could face fines, a suspended driver's license, probation terms, and professional and social repercussions. Administrative Policies 163FIREARMS POLICY Certified Florida law enforcement officers and assigned licensed and uniformed security officers are the only people permitted to possess a gun or weapon of any kind on any Everglades University campus. Any other possession of a weapon of any kind for any reason by anyone on an Everglades University campus is strictly prohibited. The above stated policy provides an exception only in the case of Everglades University students who are certified Florida law enforcement officers currently employed by a recognized Florida law enforcement agency. There are no other exceptions to this policy. CAMPUS SECURITY SAFETY ACT AND CAMPUS CRIME STATISTICS Everglades University maintains open, well-lit buildings with appropriate well-lit parking areas. Any and all incidents, including damage to personal property or suspicious persons, should be promptly reported to University administration. Students wishing a copy of the number of crimes committed on the campus can request this information from the administrative offices or see the university website at www.evergladesuniversity.edu/safety-and-security/annual-security- report/ Annual Security Report: In compliance with the 34 CFR 668.41 and 34 CFR 668.46 2008 federal regulation amendments, the following is the electronic address at which Everglades University's Annual Security Report is posted: www.evergladesuniversity.edu/ safety-and-security/annual-security-report/ The Annual Security Report contains crime statistics and describes institutional security policies. Upon request the institution will provide a hard copy of the report. CAMPUS SAFETY AND SECURITY Everglades University takes campus security seriously and believes that providing a healthy, safe, and secure environment is conducive to learning. An Emergency Exit Plan has been established for each Everglades University Campus. In the event that a situation requires an emergency evacuation, Emergency Exit Plans are posted in the classrooms, offices, computer labs, libraries, student lounges, employee lounges and at additional locations throughout each campus and provide the building occupants with the nearest emergency exit. Everglades University maintains open, well-lit buildings with appropriately well-lit parking areas. Any and all incidents including damage to personal property or suspicious persons should be reported promptly to University administration. Nothing herein precludes any student, staff or faculty from contacting the appropriate authorities directly in the event they feel in threat of physical harm or imminent danger. In cases of emergency, dial 911. STUDENT MUST KNOW EMERGENCY INFORMATION The campus takes various precautionary measures to protect the students, staff, faculty and campus visitors. Nevertheless, unavoidable emergencies may occur in extreme situations. Therefore, each campus has a Campus Response T eam (CRT) that implements and oversees the campus response to a crisis situation. The CRT receives training in dealing with crisis situations and will primarily direct the immediate response to a crisis situation until the arrival of law enforcement and emergency response personnel. In order to make this program effective, please familiarize yourself with the following emergency procedures. *** In case of emergency - dial 911*** Administrative Policies Administrative Policies164 FIRE PRECAUTIONS Students should take particular note of exit signs in each building. They should also familiarize themselves with the appropriate evacuation route posted for each room. In the event of an emergency: Leave the building by the nearest exit in an orderly fashion, following the directions of the fire marshals (where relevant). Do not use elevators. Stand at a safe distance from the building. Do not re-enter the building until directed to do so by University administration. STUDENT EMERGENCY RESPONSE Emergency Evacuation: Evacuation is the movement of campus occupants from a dangerous or potentially dangerous location to a safe location. There are two types of evacuation; fire evacuation and non-fire evacuation: Fire Evacuation: Evacuation is mandatory when a fire alarm is activated. Follow CRT instructions if given. Do not use the elevators. Assist people with disabilities if possible. Do not attempt to reenter the facility unless directed to do so. Non-Fire Evacuation: A non-fire evacuation will be initiated by campus CRT. Follow CRT instructions if given. Do not use the elevators. Assist people with disabilities if possible. Do not attempt to reenter the facility unless directed to do so. Emergency Lockdown: Emergency Lockdown is used to dramatically and rapidly enhance the level of security of the campus. By locking all exterior, interior and class doors, staff can make it more difficult for dangerous person(s) in the vicinity or in the campus to gain access to staff and students.

If a fire alarm is activated during a lockdown, proceed with extreme caution. Do not open the door for people claiming to be public safety personnel unless you have an opportunity to view photo identification or are instructed to do so by a staff member whom you recognize. External Lockdown: External lockdown creates a physical layer of security between the internal and external dimensions of the campus. This lockdown allows staff and students to continue with productive activities while maintaining access control to the campus and remain in an elevated state of security. Remain in classroom. Follow faculty and staff instructions. Remain attentive to any change in status. Administrative Policies 165Shelter in Place: Shelter in place procedures are traditionally utilized when: 1. A tornado has been spotted. 2.

Follow faculty and staff instructions. Assist people with disabilities if possible. Seek an interior room or hallway with no windows. Close windows and doors- do not lock doors. Remain in shelter until an all clear is given.

In cases involving alleged criminal conduct, the complainant may file a criminal complaint with the local police department. A complainant need not pursue a criminal complaint in order to seek or to hold the accused responsible through the University's Student Code of Conduct. As soon as possible, the complainant and the accused will be offered appropriate assistance, and our Academic Affairs department will be contacted if course adjustments are required. Based on the outcome of the investigation, the assigned Title IX Officer will determine if there is sufficient cause to proceed with the complaint. If so, the Title IX Officer will arrange for an informal resolution conference with the accused. (Complainants do not attend informal resolution meetings but are apprised of the meeting's outcome.) If the accused does not accept responsibility for the allegations and/or the proposed sanction, the Title IX Officer will determine if the evidence warrants a formal hearing before the Grievance Committee. The exact nature of the responsive action depends on the circumstances, but may include discipline up to and including suspension or dismissal from the University for a student, staff or faculty who is found to have violated University policies. IMPLEMENTING PROVISIONS/POLICIES The University will take appropriate action (i.e., an investigation, adjudication and disciplinary and remedial/corrective steps) in response to a complaint made pursuant to the complaint policies/procedures listed above. The University will make every effort to handle complaints and investigations with sensitivity to both the rights of the person who complains and the rights of the accused. Student Disciplinary/Complaint/Grievance Procedures \"I chose Everglades University because it worked around my schedule, having the degree be 100% online was great for my work/life balance. With having all of the classes online, you have time to work on school work no matter when or where you are working. My degree Bachelors of Construction Management will help me pursue two of my life goals, one getting back into the military as an Officer and two, which is to move up into a Construction Manager position at work.\" Justin Trudeau, 2020, Bachelor's in Construction Management, EU Orlando178 The University handles complaints discreetly and attempts to maintain privacy throughout the investigatory process, to the extent practicable and appropriate under the circumstances. However, in order to conduct an investigation, it is generally necessary to discuss the allegations with the accused and other potential witnesses. Additionally, the University may have legal obligations to disclose information to law enforcement or in the context of legal proceedings. Complaints may be made anonymously. While the University endeavors to investigate all complaints, including anonymous complaints, the nature of anonymous complaints makes investigation, determination, and remediation more difficult and, at times, impossible. Further, while the University attempts to protect the identity of complainants who do not wish to be identified, this may not always be possible. CONFLICT RESOLUTION Students are encouraged to first discuss any concerns with their instructor. If the concern is not resolved, they should speak to their Campus Vice President, Vice President of Academic Affairs, and University President. Chain of command should always be utilized for prompt resolution. Everglades University does however maintain an open door policy. In appropriate cases as determined by the University, conflict resolution may be possible. This is permitted only where both the complainant and accused voluntarily agree to participate, and either party may terminate informal resolution attempts and commence formal Grievance procedures at any time prior to reaching a mutually acceptable resolution. Depending on the circumstances, a mediated resolution may not necessarily involve face-to-face discussions between the complainant and the accused. Certain cases are not appropriate for conflict resolution, such as complaints of particularly egregious sexual harassment or cases involving sexual assault or violence. Occasionally, an individual makes a complaint and later wishes to revoke or discontinue the investigation or adjudication process. Similarly, it may occur that someone other than the victim reports an incident, and the victim declines to participate in the investigation or adjudication process. In other instances, complaints may be received anonymously and/or the victim may not wish to be personally identified. The University endeavors to respect the wishes of a victim to either not be identified and/or not participate in the process. In these situations, the University attempts to investigate and address complaints in accordance with the victim's wishes. If a victim wishes to talk about an incident with the assurance that the discussion will be confidential and will not result in an investigation or follow up action, the University offers confidential resources through the Title IX Officer. Contact with the Title IX Officer that does not result in a complaint being filed with the University or result in action being taken by the University. Anyone wishing to have an incident investigated, mediated or adjudicated must make a complaint in accordance with the procedures described above. In determining whether sex discrimination, sexual harassment or sexual misconduct occurred, the University does not apply the criminal standard of \"beyond a reasonable doubt,\" nor do formal court rules of evidence apply. Instead, the University uses a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard, and the University may consider any evidence it deems relevant. A \"preponderance of the evidence\" means the evidence which is of greater weight or is more convincing than opposing evidence such that it is \"more likely than not\" that an act occurred. If the applicable investigatory or adjudicatory process allows for parties to offer witnesses and evidence, the complainant and the accused will have an equal opportunity to do so. The complainant and the accused will be informed in writing of the outcome of the complaint, to the extent permitted by law. An accused who is a student may appeal the outcome to an impartial decision maker. An employee who is deemed guilty shall have whatever rights are granted by law. The particular method and grounds for appeal are explained in the student policies listed above. Student Disciplinary/Complaint/Grievance Procedures 179The University endeavors to resolve complaints promptly. Ordinarily, the investigative stage will take no longer than 60 calendar days from the time the complaint is received. In exceptional circumstances (including but not limited to especially complex cases or when the University is not in session), it may be necessary to extend these timelines. If that occurs, the parties will be informed of the expected timeline for completion. The University prohibits retaliation against any individual who in good faith makes a complaint of sex discrimination, sexual harassment, or sexual misconduct or participates as a witness in a proceeding under this or any other University policy. Retaliation is also unlawful pursuant to Title IX and other laws. EQUAL OPPORTUNITY/AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT/FERPA COMPLAINTS Everglades University admits students of any race, color, and national or ethnic origin. The University's policy of equal opportunity employment and affirmative action, consistent with Federal policy, is that no person shall, on the grounds of race, creed, color, handicap, national origin, sex, age, political affiliation, sexual orientation, marital status, or belief, be excluded from any training, be denied the benefit of, or be subjected to discrimination in any hiring practice or activity at the University. Everglades University complies with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) requiring that no qualified handicapped person will be excluded by reason of the handicap from enrolling in a course of instruction. Students wishing to avail themselves of special adjustments/accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act must disclose special needs at time of enrollment. Accordingly, every effort is made to make reasonable adjustments/ accommodations. Certain programs may require manual dexterity. Please consult campus Admissions Offices for further information. Everglades University complies with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act-1974 (Public Law 93-380) concerning student records. Student information will only be released to any person, agency or legal authority as required by subpoena/legal process or by consent of the student (or eligible parent). Information will only be released on a consent basis where the student or eligible parent has provided written consent, signed, dated and specifying the information to be released, the reason for release and the name(s) of persons to whom the information is to be released. Student Disciplinary/Complaint/Grievance Procedures 180 A student who feels they have not been treated fairly under the University's stated federal policies has the right to file a written complaint. A complaint should be submitted to the Vice President of the University. These procedures apply only to complaints received in writing. A complaint is submitted in person, by U.S. mail, or by email. Complaints should be dated. All written complaints will be acknowledged by the University within 10 business days of receipt of the complaint. The date of receipt should be marked on the complaint. Within 15 business days after acknowledging receipt of an Equal Opportunity, Americans with Disabilities, or FERPA complaint, the Vice President will inform the complainant regarding the institutional response to the written complaint. Students have the right to file a grievance with the University in the event they are not satisfied with the University's response. The steps to request a grievance are as follows: GRIEVANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES Introduction: If Everglades University is forced to take action against a student, it still believes strongly that every student has a right to procedural due process in which a student has notice and an opportunity to be heard. If the administration has to take disciplinary measures against a student or other action related to a student, the student may appeal the decision to the Grievance Committee. Students are encouraged to resolve problems through normal administrative channels. A petition for a grievance hearing must be made in writing and submitted to the Director of Student Services. The grievance is then scheduled to be heard before the Committee. The Grievance Committee panel is a standing committee that meets at 1:00 p.m. each Tuesday if a grievance is to be heard. The voting members of the Grievance Committee consist of two (2) faculty members, two (2) staff members, and one (1) student. The voting members of the committee/panel are non-biased participants. The Director of Student Services is the facilitator/moderator of the grievance hearing and a non-voting member of the proceedings. The Panel will hear evidence, ask questions, review the catalog/handbook policies, deliberate and render an advisory ruling that, upon approval by the Office of the President, will become binding upon the administration as well as the student who filed the grievance. Purpose : The Grievance Committee/Panel exists as a mechanism to provide a fair hearing for students. The goal of the Panel is to ascertain if Everglades University's policy has been adhered to. The Panel will hear evidence, ask questions, review the catalog/handbook policies, deliberate and render an advisory ruling that, upon approval by the President, will become binding upon the administration as well as the student who filed the grievance. Request for Grievance Committee: The \"Request for a Grievance Committee\" form may be obtained from the Director of Student Services at any time during normal business hours. The request form contains the name of the student requesting the grievance process, the date, space for a narrative explanation of the problem/reason for the grievance, name and relation of anyone that will be attending the grievance process with the student and a signature blank. All \"Requests for a Grievance Committee\" by a student should be submitted to the Director of Student Services. Student Disciplinary/Complaint/Grievance Procedures 181GRIEVANCE PROCESS AND PROCEDURES Complete a \"Request for a Grievance Committee\" form. The form must be signed and dated with a full explanation of the problem/reason for the appeal concerning the student. The form must include the names and relation of any additional people to be there on behalf of the student. The student may bring legal counsel to the hearing but legal counsel cannot speak on behalf of the student. The student must represent them self and present his/her case to the panel. The \"Request for a Grievance Committee\" form must be submitted to the Director of Student Services. Upon receipt of the \"Request for a Grievance Committee,\" the Director of Student Services will schedule the hearing within 10 business days of receipt of the request. The Director of Student Services will return a copy of the Request form to the student with the bottom portion completed to indicate date, place, and time of the Hearing. On the day of the appeal the Director of Student Services will present a brief introduction of the student requesting the appeal as well as members of the panel who will hear the issues. The Director of Student Services will also provide a brief overview of the nature and chronology of the proceedings. The student will have ten (10) minutes in which to present his/her views, documentation, and/or other evidence in opposition to the position or action taken by the University. During the presentation of the student, members of the panel will have the opportunity to ask questions and view any documentation provided by the student. A representative of the University will have ten (10) minutes in which to present the position of the University and/or the basis for the action taken by the University. Following the conclusion of the presentation by the University representative, both the student and the representative of the University will have the opportunity for a three (3) minute rebuttal. The student will be permitted to rebut first and the University second. Following the rebuttal, the Director of Student Services will ask for final questions. a) The student will be instructed as to the date that they can expect notification of the Grievance Panel's decision. b) Then the student and the University representative will be excused. The members of the panel will deliberate. This decision will be forwarded to the Campus Vice President for review and forwarded to the Office of the President for final approval.. Absent extenuating circumstances, the student requesting the hearing will be notified of the decision within seventy-two (72) hours (3 Business Days). STUDENT DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES If a student violates Everglades University's Standards of Conduct in a classroom, the first level of discipline lies with the faculty member. If a situation demands further action, the dean of academic affairs is responsible. In the absence of the dean, the Campus Vice President determines disciplinary action. If a student has a serious objection to the disciplinary action imposed, the student has the right to use the grievance process as outlined in the Everglades University catalog. When a student violates Everglades University's Standards of Conduct outside the classroom but on campus, the Dean of Academic Affairs is the first level of discipline. The next level is the Campus Vice President. If a student is dissatisfied with the disciplinary action imposed, the student has the right to use the grievance process as outlined in the Everglades University catalog.

Graduation Requirements184 DISTANCE LEARNING DISTANCE LEARNING OBJECTIVES Everglades University understands and supports the educational needs of adult learners and those who cannot attend on campus classes. T oward that end, a distance learning program has been developed. It is important to understand what online classes are and what they are not. Online classes are not easy substitutes for on campus classes. In fact, students find online classes as rigorous and demanding as on campus classes. Students are expected to attend the virtual classroom a specified number of times per week. All attendance is monitored. The times are flexible and dictated by the students' personal schedules; but nonetheless their presence is required and recorded and counts toward the final grades. An online student is expected to be computer-literate and familiar with the Internet. An orientation course is available to help students improve these skills. An online class is convenient and flexible. It allows students to work on assignments and participate in class discussions as their schedules permit within reasonable timeframes. Learning is achieved through individual inquiry, collaborative processes (student/student and student/faculty) and personal synthesis of ideas into an understanding of the topic. Outcomes are determined by qualitative analysis of student input, subjective and objective tests, including pre- and post-tests, group and individual projects and case studies. DISTANCE LEARNING PROGRAMS AND COURSES OF STUDY All programs of study are available 100% online via distance learning. Expected learning outcomes and completion requirements for these programs are identical to those in the on campus program. PREREQUISITES FOR PARTICIPATION IN DISTANCE LEARNING Admissions requirements for distance learning programs are identical to on campus programs. Additionally, students must demonstrate the ability to succeed in an online web-based educational environment. An assessment is given during the admissions process to evaluate the student's ability to succeed in the online environment. In addition, an online orientation and assessment is given to online students by an online trainer to assess computer skills and proficiency. Students receiving a low proficiency score from the online trainer are referred to a Dean of Academic Affairs, or Vice President for further review prior to starting their program. DISTANCE LEARNING FACULTY/STUDENT INTERACTION Given the unique nature of online learning, faculty/student interaction is critical for success. Online classes offer several opportunities for interaction, both faculty/student and student/student interaction. Some methods of interaction include online lectures, email, document sharing, threaded discussions and chat rooms. Students are required to log in and participate in the online class a specified number of times per week. Faculty log in daily to review, respond and reply to students. Faculty respond within a 24-hour time period. More traditional methods of contact are also available, including phone (toll free for those out of area), and virtual office visits via webinar. DISTANCE LEARNING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT Everglades University has computer labs with Internet access that are available for student use. Everglades University provides technical services and training through its online platform. Online students must have their own high-speed Internet access, and provide their own personal desktop or laptop computer with speakers and a webcam. Students' computers should capable of running updated browsers and Microsoft Office applications. Distance Learning 185DISTANCE LEARNING SERVICES Student services can be provided in the following three ways: electronically, via the telephone, or in person. Adequate personnel are provided by the University to meet your student service needs. Specifically, the University offers the following student services to all online students.

Students who wish to order their books independently should notify the University's bookstore. Please visit the Online Bookstore at https://www.evergladesuniversity.edu/bookstore/ for more information. DISTANCE LEARNING PLACEMENT ASSISTANCE Placement assistance for graduates is available to students through the Student Services Department. The Student Services Department can be contacted either by email, telephone or in-person to request placement assistance.
