Naturopathic medicine can help drug and alcohol addiction by getting to the root of it and helping the person heal from the physical, emotional, and spiritual damages of drug addiction. Holistic therapies are also beneficial in easing withdrawal symptoms and reducing the risk of relapse. Some holistic therapies used in treating addiction include: Acupuncture [Acupuncture therapy](https://www.theriversource.org/blog/5-holistic-therapies-that-can-make-drug-detox-easier/) can help ease aches and pains and symptoms of co-occurring disorders such as bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, and depression, which can also be a powerful tool in dual diagnosis programs. Massage therapy Massage is helpful in drug and alcohol detox and rehab to reduce aches and pain, relieve stress, and reduce the tension that comes up during drug addiction treatment. Yoga and Tai Chi As both meditation therapy and exercise therapy, yoga and tai chi has helped many in recovery ease pain and work on mindfulness and symptoms of mental illness associated with alcohol and drug abuse. Exercise and Fitness therapy Exercise is essential to addiction recovery because it can help regulate neurotransmitters, strengthen the body, reduce stress, and help build new healthy behaviors. Nutrition Therapy Those who struggle with drug addiction often struggle with nutritional deficiencies as well. Nutrition therapy can be a vital component of helping to rebuild health systems and introduce a new way of healthy living in addiction recovery.
