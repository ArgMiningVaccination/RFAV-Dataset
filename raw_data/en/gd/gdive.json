[Sunscreen Safety Is Under Fire This Summer\u2014Doctors Share the Facts](https://www.thehealthy.com/skin-health/sun/safe-sunscreen-doctors/) Dr. Deena Adimoolam, MD, an endocrinologist and internal medicine specialist, explains to The Healthy @Reader's Digest: \"Certain sunscreens may contain such as oxybenzone, octinoxate, parabens, and phthalates. These chemicals, when absorbed in excess and over time, can be linked to several hormone issues.\" Dr. Trevor Cates, ND, a naturopathic doctor, says that according to the Endocrine Society, endocrine disruptor chemicals have been associated with fertility issues, early breast development, breast cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid disease, neuroendocrine problems, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Dr. Rosia Parrish, ND, a naturopathic doctor and functional medicine practitioner with the Naturopathic Wellness Center of Boulder in Colorado suggests some sunscreen ingredients to consider avoiding are avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate, and Retinyl Palmitate (which can reportedly enhance skin cancer lesions), as well as synthetic ingredients such as PEG, dimethicone, and phenoxyethanol. Dr. Parrish adds that people who are particularly sensitive to hormonal changes or have conditions such as [polycystic ovarian syndrome](https://www.thehealthy.com/weight-loss/pcos-diet/) (PCOS) or endometriosis should pay extra attention to whether their sunscreen contains hormone-disrupting ingredients.

Hormone-safe sunscreens are typically mineral-based, with either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide as the active ingredient, sometimes combined with antioxidant-rich botanicals. Mineral-based sunscreens also tend to be free of harmful chemicals that can mess with your hormones or other systems of your body. [4 Unexpected Body Parts That Are Musts for Sunscreen, Says Research](https://www.thehealthy.com/skin-health/sun/sunscreen-eyelids-hands-lips-scalp-dermatologists/) What to look for in a hormone-safe sunscreen As with just about any product you buy off the shelves, including packaged groceries, it's wise to read the ingredients list to ensure it's free from potentially harmful chemicals.
