Th e lesion leaves children with a permanent motor impairment [1]. Th e lesion is attributed to nonprogressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain; prenatal events are thought to be responsible for about 75% of all CP cases [2], and 10 to 18% of CP is thought to be caused postnatal [3]. Th e predominant types of motor impairment of CP are spastic, dyskinetic, and ataxic [4,5]. Approximately, 70 to of children with CP are spastic, which is quadriplegia type of CP , which accounts for about 44% and may account for 50% of the total incidence of CP [8,9]. Walking patterns of diplegic CP children are established at 5 to 7 years of age and they change with age. Th e common problems in the stance phase of gait pattern are equinovarus, jump knee, crouch knee, and internal rotation of the legs, whereas shortened step length and impaired foot clearance are the common problems in the swing phase [9]. Th ese problems occur at the sagittal plane, which may coexist with frontal and transverse pathologies [10]. A child with CP may walk with excessive frontal plane sway (trunk lunching gait), which is an increase in the side-to-side movement of the trunk during walking [9]. It is caused by defi ciency of balance and it may represent compensation for reduction in the distal degree of freedom [11]. Visual cognition is an ability to manipulate and integrate visual inputs with other sensory information to gain knowledge, solve problems, formulate plans, and make decisions [12]. Th e visual cognition considered as highest order in a hierarchical model of visual Effect of using visual cognitive task on gait in children with spastic diplegia Zeinb A. Hussein Background Cognitive processing plays an important role in motor performance; thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of concurrent use of visual cognitive task and gait training task on gait in children with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. Participants and methods Fifteen spastic diplgic cerebral palsied children selected from out patient clinic Faculty of Physical Therapy Cairo University (nine boys and six girls) participated in this study. Children with a mean age of 8.15 \u00b1 1.21 years, with a degree of spasticity 2 according to the modi ed Ashworth scale, with level II according to the Gross Motor Function Classi cation System, and having a trunk lurching pattern during gait were selected. They received the physical therapy program for an hour and visual cognitive task during gait training for another hour per day. The treatment program was conducted three times per week for 3 successive months. The lateral trunk lurching and gait parameters (spatial and temporal) were assessed, before and after treatments with the prorefl ex system. Results The results revealed a signi cant decrease in lateral trunk lurching angle before and after treatment (P < 0.001), a signi cant decrease in gait speed and cadence, and a signi cant increase in stride length and time of double limb support before and after treatment ( P < 0.001).

Th erefore, the visual cognitive processing cannot occur without visual attention - that is, the ability of the central nervous system to receive clear, concise visual input from the environment through the visual functions of oculomotor control, visual fi elds, and visual acuity [13]. Simultaneous using of cognitive task and motor task is defi ned as a dual-task condition which requires high attention, therefore attention divided into two tasks [14,15]. Th e attentional requirements of balancing of a CP child when performing a task, while simultaneously performing a second cognitive task cause reduced attention to balance control and an increased risk for falls [16]. Th us, the aim of this study was to evaluate the concurrent use of visual cognitive task and gait training task on gait in children with spastic diplegic CP . Participants and methods Th is study was conducted on 15 spastic diplegic CP children (nine boys and six girls). Th ey were selected from the outpatient clinic, Faculty of Physical Th erapy, Cairo University. Children with a mean age of 8.15 \u00b1 1.21 years [17-19], a degree of spasticity of 2 according to the modifi ed Ashworth scale [20], and level II of the Gross Motor Function Classifi cation System [21] were included in the study. Th ey had trunk lurching gait pattern, intelligence quotient not less than 85 on Stanford Binet as referred by a psychologist, and the ability to see, hear and communicate, whereas children with fi xed deformities in the ankle or knee joints were excluded from the study. Parents of children with selected criteria were asked to sign an informed consent form approved by the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of Human Subjects at the Faculty of Physical Th erapy. Th e children received selected physical therapy program for 1 h, in addition to gait training with concurrent visual cognitive task for another 1 h. Th e treatment was conducted three times per week for 3 successive months. Trunk lurching angle from the frontal plane during walking and kinematic gait parameters (spatial and temporal) were measured using the prorefl ex system before and after treatment procedures. Assessment procedures Th e trunk lurching and gait parameters were measured with the prorefl ex system, which consists of six cameras acting as three-dimensional cameras; it was calibrated using a wand-kit, moving it in three planes, the X, Z, and Y planes, to assure accuracy of the values obtained by viewing the dots on three cameras on each side. Th e refl ected dots were put bilateral on both sides on the anterior superior iliac spines, lateral malleolus , the base of fi fth metatarsal bones, and sternal notch, for every child. Each child was asked to walk from the end of a wooden walkway to its other end far enough from the measurement area to enable the child to take a natural walking pattern without any interference to his or her gait pattern, but care was taken to keep him or her from falling. Th e gait cycles were captured within the measuring area (complete cycle starts from initial contact of one leg to terminal swing of the same leg), selectively entered into the Q tools software and then imported into the TSV fi le to be saved and analyzed. Th e data displayed from the prorefl ex system are as follows: (1) Th e peak angle of trunk deviation (peak-to-peak angle in degrees), which is the summation of the angle of maximum deviation of the trunk to the right side with the angle of maximum deviation to the left side. Th is angle is considered as amount of trunk lurching [22]. (2) Kinematic gait parameters (spatial and temporal): Spatial parameters are velocity and stride length, and temporal parameters are percentage of swing time, percentage of stance time, and cadence [14]. Treatment procedures (1) Th e physical therapy program included gait training, start with side way walking, then forward walking, and end by backward walking, also increase diffi culty of each exercise by using stepper, obstacles of diff erent sizes and up and down stairs of diff erent heights, and balance exercise applied by using wooden and soft ramps, balance board, and balance beam. (2) Visual cognition task. Selection of pictures About 204 pictures were selected, which were familiar to normally developed children to be identifi ed and named at this age. Th ese pictures were grouped into six groups as follows: group 1 included 38 pictures of foodstuff s such as fruits, vegetables, and sandwich; group 2 included 44 pictures of animals and plants; group 3 included 26 pictures of means of transportation; group 4 included 36 pictures of clothes; group 5 included 20 pictures of furniture; and group 6 included 40 pictures of tools used in home, or in the school [14]. Each child was fi rst seated on a comfortable chair in front of the laptop to identify and name all pictures.178 Bulletin of Faculty of Physical Therapy Time of picture rotation Pictures were changed at a rate of one picture every 3 s, which was calculated using a stop watch [23]. Moreover, we conducted a pilot study to ensure the time taken to name each picture. Picture presentation Th e pictures were presented on Microsoft Power Point slide 2010 United States on full screen by choosing slide show tool on the laptop, with the height of the tripod at the level of the child's eyes using the height scale. The task during gait training Th e child was asked to stand at the end of the walkway 6 m away from the laptop. Children were instructed to walk directly forward without stopping and without deviation and concentrate on the pictures in front of them and say its name clearly. Verbal guidance was used to prevent the child from falling and also to reward for the accurate answer as very good, excellent, or that is well. Th e training was carried out for 1 h per time, three times per week, for 3 successive months. Th e pictures were selected from groups and changed after two or three times of training to keep the interest of the child well. Th e pretreatment and post treatment mean values of gait parameters (spatial and temporal), and the trunk lurching angle were measured and compared by using unpaired t test. Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) computer program (version 19 windows) was used for data analysis. P value 0.05 was considered signifi cant.Results Th e post treatment mean values of trunk lurching angle (the peak angle of trunk deviation) decreased to 21.8 \u00b1 7.23\u00b0 degrees with mean diff erence about 18.53\u00b0 which was statistically signifi cant (P < 0.001) (Table 1). Gait parameters On comparing the post-treatment mean values of velocity (1.07 \u00b1 0.17 m/min), percentage of stance time (69.21 \u00b1 7.04% of time total gait (75.36 \u00b1 16.61 m/min, 84 \u00b1 5.07% cycle, and 79.07 \u00b1 14.85 steps/min, respectively), there was a decrease with signifi cant diff erences (P < 0.05*), whereas there was an increase in the post- treatment mean values of stride length (61.00 \u00b1 12.29 cm) and percentage of with signifi cant diff erences (P < 0.05*) when compared with the pretreatment mean values, which were 46.86 \u00b1 120.61 cm and 15.57 \u00b1 5.23%, respectively (Table 2). Discussion Children in this study used visual cognitive task concurrently during gait training as a rehabilitation program adjunct with physical therapy program. Th e results showed decrease in the angle of lateral trunk lurching (deviation of trunk laterally) and change in gait parameters after training for 3 months.

After training, it was found that lateral trunk lurching angle decreased which might increase postural control, because the child used attention in its two levels: a voluntary level (directed by the cortex), which focuses on decreasing body sway, and an automatic or refl exive level (controlled by brain stem), which focuses on pictures appearing in the peripheral visual fi eld. Th ese results were supported by Sethi and Raja [24], Marshall et al. [25], and Bensoussan et al. [26], who m entioned that when the task places a greater diffi culty on a child, it is eff ective in improving balance and functional recovery and that interactions between cognitive function and motor behaviors improve attention with training, which could aff ect balance. Th e trunk lurching angle (body sway) decreased by 18.53\u00b0 in post training program with using visual cognitive task during walking (Table 1). It was found that the visual feedback information is primarily used to control balance in the laterolateral direction, as the visual system provides information not only about the target distance and presence of obstacles but also about maintaining balance during walking and adjusting trajectories when an obstacle appears or if the target is shifted [27-29]. Th is agreed with the opinion of Levitt [30], who stated that the most treatment programs use more aff erent stimuli of visual, auditory, and proprioceptive stimuli with various methods intended for reduction of abnormal postural alignments and stimulate normal movement pattern. Moreover, improvement of good alignment of the trunk after gait training using visual task may be due to use visual gaze on the fi xed picture in front of the child's sight, that also concluded by Cromwell et al. [31], that gaze stabilization was expected to gradually facilitate head and trunk vertical alignment as stationary visual information has a stabilizing eff ect on posture. Th ere is a reciprocal relationship between head-trunk stability and gaze stability. Th is vertical alignment of the trunk facilitates the vestibular system, which sends motor control signals through the nervous system to the muscles of the eyes with the vestibule-ocular refl ex. Th e vestibule-ocular refl ex is responsible for maintaining stability of the image on the center (fovea) of the retina during rapid head movement. Th is enables the eyes to remain fi xed in pace (gaze stability) during functional task and so gaze stabilization exercise, which utilizes the focal vision, is commonly used to rehabilitate patients with postural imbalance and vice versa [32-34].Th e parameters of gait changed after training using visual cognition, as interference of attention divided between the two tasks, leading to decrease in the post-treatment mean value of velocity compared with pretreatment mean values when walkin g at 0.07 m/min. Th is may have an impact on trunk stability, as the body can be displaced with a proper speed, keeping it more constant as possible for the conservation of momentum and minimizing upper body oscillations and hence the risk of fall [35,36]. Slow gait velocity that occurred in post treatment gait pattern, it might provide greater stability by decreasing trunk sway and increasing percentage of stance time (i.e: time at which the both feet are on the ground simultaneously) [37]. Th e improvement in the percentage of stance time and swing time might be due to the improvement of trunk stability, which is essential to the control of walking [38]. Training improves the ability of the child to direct attention selectively, which is one of the most important things that is emphasized by established motor learning theories and strategies. Introduction of early distraction to visual task other than the motor task may improve children's ability to deal with irrelevant information, and gives the children a chance to develop strategies for selective attention that can be learned at the real-world environment. In the study, the children acquired ability to direct their attention towards the cognitive recourses while the attention required for planning and performing of the motor task was decreased, and they were able to process and interpret the diff erent feedback information including those pertaining to their performance and make an adequate corrective response, improving the effi ciency of feedback [39,40]. In addition, the concurrent use of cognitive and motor tasks at the same time (dual-tasks) decrease gait velocity, which in itself is associated with a decrease in body sway. Th e slowing of the gait is to reduce the risk of falling in more diffi cult circumstances to p erform a dual task [40]. Eff ects of concurrent cognitive tasks on locomotor performance in children can lead to larger steps when walking under dual task conditions; this improvement may be due to increased attention to step length as child attempts to reach to the pictures without falling [41]. Th e results of this study contradicted with those of Brauer et al. [42], who revealed that when the children with spastic CP performed two tasks simultaneously, it appeared that they directed their attentional resources primarily to the performance of the cognitive task, resulting in a decrement in the secondary task of postural control. Limitations of the study Th e sample size in the study was small due to limited inclusive criteria of selected children, and the study 180 Bulletin of Faculty of Physical Therapy was limited to children who were unable to identify a picture for three trials. Conclusion When visual cognitive task was used concurrently with gait training for 3 successive months, lateral trunk lurching (body sway) decreased and stride length and stance time % increased, whereas velocity and cadence during walking decreased in children with spastic diplegic CP . Th erefore, the concurrent use of visual cognition with gait training could increase postural control on trunk and lower limbs.
