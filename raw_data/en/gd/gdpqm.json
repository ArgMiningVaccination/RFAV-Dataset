If you plan on using complementary medicine please be aware that it is all too easy for people to set themselves up as complementary therapists who in reality have little or no training. It is important, therefore, to ensure that any therapist you go to is a member of a recognised body and it is essential to satisfy yourself as to whether they have had correct training and that their qualifications are genuine. There are people out there who will prey on those who are sick and vulnerable and looking for healing simply to make money for themselves and also therapists who will tell you to ignore medical advice or stop medical treatment which is highly irresponsible and can be extremely dangerous. There are of course many genuine complementary therapists who can provide genuine care and help to complement traditional medicine.
