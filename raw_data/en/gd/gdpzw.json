The study was carried out by Colombian, American and Canadian scientists working in close collaboration with the Inganosthemselves. The Inganos are a tribe of Amerindians living in the western-most Colombian Amazon, primarily in the stateof Caquet\u00e1. Like most Indigenous Peoples, their contact with the outside world has had a serious (and primarily negative) impact on their diet. Particularly serious factorscausing the decline in the quality of their nutritional inputincludes acculturation (particularly with the degradation of local knowledge of, and pride in, traditional agricultural practices) and access to low-quality Western foods (especiallycarbonated drinks and refined flour) - factors common to many of the indigenous studies carried out by the Center for Indigenous Peoples' Nutrition and Environment(CINE) and presented in this volume. Factors relatively unique to the Colombian example are the degree of deforestation, the ongoing political violence, and thelevels of water contamination due to byproducts of the local cocaine trade. The study focuses at all stages on the process of maximizing community involvement. Representatives of every age group participated, from Elders - born prior to colonial contact - to newborn infants. Prior consultation,consensus decision-making, and human rights issues wereintegral cornerstones of the study. The study documented - for the first time ever - the complexity of the original Ingano diet: over 160 types of food, ranging from roots to insects to palm tree products. Pre- contact health status is assumed to have been better thanthe current situation in terms of diversity of foods, although precise data on health status were not available. Eight items from the traditional diet were deemed necessary for maintainingand improving local health: (1) milpesos palm, (2) yoco liana , (3) cayamba mushroom, (4) bitter cane, (5) beetle larvae, (6) churo snail, (7) cucha fish and (8) the cimarron herb. By using local Ingano knowledge and working closely with Inga communities to better understand traditional diet and current nutritional deficits and needs, this study hopes to contributepositively to Ingano health and well-being. Introduction In the western Colombian Amazon, a region of exceptionally high biological diversity, liveseveral indigenous tribes who have expertisein traditional medicine, medicinal plants, andthe art of shamanism since pre-conquest times.Their traditional system of resource management entails slash and burn agriculture - primarily based onmanioc (a form of cassava), corn and several varietiesof fruit trees - hunting, fishing, and harvesting of wildforest products. Their cosmovision, connected intimatelywith the natural world, is closely aligned with theirceremonies and the consumption of their sacred plant- yag\u00e9, or ayahuasca - that enables them to communicate with their spiritual world and helps determine their 85 Ingano traditional food and health: Phase 1, 2004-2005\"Let's return to our food, our lifeand our tradition. With our food, we will improve our health, will recover our culture, and willtake care of the natural world.We need our plants and our jungle in order to have strength and to live better. \" Eva Yela, Ingano community membersocial order, environmental ethics and holistic health management system. For geographic and historic reasons, these groups (referred to by anthropologists as the \" yag\u00e9 culture\") have been able to preserve their traditions and theirtraditional systems of production and nutrition betterthan many others in lowland Amazonia. Nevertheless,during the last hundred years, the religious missions,the increased presence of the state and the extractiveeconomy of quinine, rubber, gold and petroleum, theindiscriminate felling of the forest, plus the recentexpanded cultivation of illicit crops and increasedpresence of armed forces, have produced a demographicand cultural debacle, with loss of indigenous territories,destruction of environment, and marked changes inIngano customs. All of this has almost led to theirphysical and cultural extinction and has given rise toillness and malnutrition, in addition to serious damageto their cosmovision and their traditional medicine. Among these tribes are the Inganos, fragmented and scattered among three Colombian provinces who,since 1986, have been united within the organizationknown as the Association of Indigenous Communities(Tandachiridu Inganokuna), and who have written a\"Plan de Vida\" (\"Life Plan\") that proposes innovativesolutions to the challenges of cultural preservation andthe conservation of their territories and environment.With the support of NGOs like the Amazon ConservationTeam (Amazon Conservation Team, Washington DC,2004), these tribespeople have developed successfulprogrammes of ethno-education, territorial recovery,environmental conservation, practice and perpetuationof traditional medicine, and sustainable agriculturalproduction, among others. Historically, the Inganos have been recognized as a relatively healthy group, with a long life expectancy.Current health problems are derived from recent effectsof colonization, the loss of territories, the decrease inprotein sources, the acculturation and loss of traditionalmedicine and the changes in eating habits. The reductionof their territories has resulted in diminished access towild foods such as meats, fish and fruits. One of theirmost important medicinal species - yoco (Paullinia yoco) - is valued as a stimulant, a food and a medicine.Yoco has traditionally been used by the Inganos and is now in danger of eminent extinction - leading toincreased reliance on non-traditional foodstuffs thatcause health problems. Social \"development\" projects,such as cattle ranching and intense agriculture, havecaused more problems than they have solved. Theacculturation that comes with schools, health centresand publicity in mass communication media hasworsened the eating habits of the youth, who abandontraditional foods to embrace processed food, which ismore expensive, less nutritional and often harmful totheir health. This case study in Colombia (Figure 5.1) has become integrated into the Life Plan of the Association ofIndigenous Communities in the Amazon district, andhas four fundamental pillars: (1) the ethno-educationprogramme of the local Yachaicury School, with theindigenous youths implementing a traditional foodrecovery programme to improve nutrition and health;(2) a biological resource and food supply security pro-gramme which relies on the indigenous agro-ecologicalpromoters who work toward the recovery of traditionalseeds and the development of productive farms; (3) thetraditional medicine programme in which variousshamans from several ethnic groups oversee the protection,defence and recovery of their medicine and the use ofmedicinal plants; and (4) the environmental conservationprogramme, essential since the Association partneredwith the Colombian government to establish the country'sfirst protected area for biocultural conservation, theIndi Wasi National Park. Therefore, the CINE pro-gramme with which we are associated is very much inline with the Indians' stated intention to taking chargeof the cultural and environmental destiny based primarilyon indigenous wisdom and traditions. Description of Ingano research site and Indigenous People Geographic and environmental characteristics Southern-most Colombia at the eastern slopes of the eastern-most Andean chain is the area inhabited by Indigenous Peoples' food systems |Ingano 86the tribes in this study. This region is located between 150 and 500 m above sea level. Because it is locatedon the equator, there are no significant seasonal differencesin solar radiation, which means that the variation inaverage monthly temperatures is minimal. Seasonalityin this region is affected and defined by changes inprecipitation periods. The piedmont region is greatly influenced by pluvial cycle peaks, which have caused serious avalanches overtime. Showers of more than 100 mm in 24 hours areactually frequent (Mej\u00eda, 1993). Average precipitationvaries between 3 500 mm/year and 4 300 mm/year.The months with the highest precipitation levels areApril, May, June and July. Those with lower precipitationlevels are December, January and February. Moderateprecipitation can be observed during March, August,September, October and November. Relative humidityoscillates between 64 percent and 93 percent (AgendaUnitaria del Caquet\u00e1, 2002; Lozano et al. , 2001). Soils are quickly eroding because of agricultural exploitation. Another related problem is illicit cropproduction, involving extensive use of agrochemicals.Generally speaking, there are two types of soils: 1) thosefound in the high plains of humid or very humidweather (haplorthox and dystropepts); and 2) thosefound in zones of very humid and pluvial weather, withplain or undulated relief, well or poorly drained(fluvaquents, tropaquepts) (IGAC, 1986). According to the morphology and relief of the eastern chain's eastern slope, it is possible to divide theregion into sectors with respect to the vertical distributionof the slopes. Schematically, it can be said that in high-mountain areas vertical slopes are very cragged, graduallybecoming less pronounced towards lower areas. Beloware plains with slopes containing desiccated or elevatedterraces. The piedmont belongs to the transition areabetween steep slopes and plains. The transition betweenthe Amazonian lowlands to the east, and the Andesmountain chain at the west, characterizes this region.When grouping the distribution of the slopes accordingto their altitude, three elevation ranges were established.Flat areas are most common below 400 m above sealevel. A transition can be observed between 400 and900 m, where both gentle and pronounced slopes arefound, while steep slopes predominate over 900 m above sea level (Sarmiento and Alzate, 2004). In additionto these precipitation characteristics, there are someerosion problems caused by loss of vegetable layer, hightemperatures and precipitation levels that cause acceleratedloss of soil nutrients. As for water quality, contamination is now common. As streams run through populated areas, qualityconsiderably decreases for there is no adequate treatmentfor domestic and agricultural residues. Many watersources have been diminished or even dried up byerosion, and others disappear during months with lowprecipitation. For this reason, availability of potablewater is a growing problem. The fumigation of coca crops has also become a serious problem. The sprayed pesticides fall onto grazingpastures or farmlands. When this happens in maturecrops - especially manioc and banana - inhabitantsharvest and consume them rapidly to avoid their loss,even if that means ingesting toxic chemicals. Anotherfactor that considerably reduces water quality is theway in which cocasa (cocaine processing waste) isdiscarded - because this is released into the water supply,rivers and streams become toxic. There are no fixed pollution sources in the area. Agricultural and livestock activities are based on theperiodic burning of pastures during low precipitationmonths. This common activity reaches considerableproportions, although there are no detailed analysesof the phenomenon. The impact of acid rain is consideredto be low or null, for cloudy masses are formed in theAmazon where emissions are not toxic enough. However,there are no studies that can offer precise data on thelevel of rain contamination. According to the general ecosystem map (M\u00e1rquez, 2003), this region marks the transition between lowlandhumid forests, submontane forests and, finally, mountainsand high mountains. Below 1 000 m above sea level,lowland humid forests are characterized by high averagetemperatures and pluvial indexes above 1 500 mm/year,with a high canopy that varies between 20 and 50 m.Between 1 000 and 2 000 m above sea level, thesubmontane forests include elements of the ecosystemslocated above and beneath them. This ecosystem is 87 Ingano traditional food and health: Phase 1, 2004-2005characterized by both high humidity and pluvial levels, for it is located just where cloudy masses are chargedwith water and collide with the mountains along theirway west through the Amazon. Canopies have anaverage height of 35 m. According to studies carriedout on this region, satellite images can help to establishthe increment on deforestation, gracing lands or nakedsoils rates in these forests (Sarmiento and Alzate, 2004). Deforestation started during the 1940s when people from other regions in the country began to colonizethe area. According to the inhabitants, during that timeforests were continuous, but extensive livestock activitiesduring the subsequent decades turned the forests intopastures. Today, plains and savannas have also beenturned into pastures. In smaller farms, pastures sharethe area with banana and manioc crops. Deforestationhas also increased near the mountains during the lastyears because of the arrival of additional peasants seekingland to cultivate coca. These activities have all but exterminated the wild animals that previously constituted the indigenouscommunities' main source of proteins. Plant speciesimportant for traditional medicine have also beendiminished. Caquet\u00e1: Departmental profile Rural areas in the Department of Caquet\u00e1 are sufferingfrom overpopulation and low income because of theinflux of landless peasants fleeing violence in otherparts of the country. This regrettable situation hasforced people living in rural areas to become involvedin illicit alternatives to generate incomes. Of the 5 million acres surveyed by the Department, 99percent were used for illicit crops and stockbreeding(Aguirre, 2004). The main crops of Caquet\u00e1 are rice, beans, corn, soy, cocoa, cocona ,chontaduro , lulo, mandarin oranges, African oil palm, pineapple, manioc, banana andsugarcane. The acre yield for all these crops is relativelylow. As for cattle rearing, studies show a considerabledeficiency, with low milk and meat production. Deficiencies in roads and telecommunicationsinfrastructure also exacerbate this problem, as theyhinder contact and exchange between market centres as well as increasing the inputs and production costs. Facing this critical situation, there are insufficient financial resources to invest in technology transfer andtechnical assistance. Some regional and nationalinstitutions have developed and disseminated technologyfor sustainable forestry and agricultural extension.However, because of the lack of resources and adequateagricultural policies, this technology has not yet beenconsistently developed or applied. This issue has ledto depopulation of some rural areas and diminutionof the agricultural business profitability, explained bythe evident increase of the price of inputs, such aslabour. In addition, the social situation of the countrystrongly affects that of the departmental rural areas,for abandonment of the countryside further aggravatesthe original problem (Aguirre, 2004). Caquet\u00e1 Department is part of the Amazon basin. Virgin forests exist on nearly 60 percent of this territory,mostly placed on the eastern slope of the eastern Andeswhere the headwaters of the Caquet\u00e1 river - one of themajor tributaries of the Amazon - are located. Nearly70 percent of Caquet\u00e1's territory is governed by lawsenforcing protection or special management of itsnatural resources (Aguirre, 2004), but these are poorlyenforced. The General Social Security Health System seeks to provide social protection to the most vulnerable partof the population and assure that they receive appropriatehealthcare and access to basic services. However, thisdepartment's healthcare goals have never been metfully. In fact, many reserves and settlements do nothave basic health services. Caquet\u00e1's inhabitants generallypoor health situation is, in general terms, the result of several factors: fast urbanization accelerated bydisplacement, presence of illicit crops such as coca, andarmed conflict. Poverty is severe, and there is lowinsurance coverage because of scarce economic resources.Therefore, healthcare services are inadequate for thepopulation. The department has additionally identifiedthe following problems: high maternal and infantmorbidity rates (one of the highest in the country)resulting from difficulties to access prenatal care; lackof safe delivery programmes and lack of monitoring Indigenous Peoples' food systems |Ingano 88of children's growth and development; and lack of coordinated policies that ensure suitable food forpregnant women and children under five years of age.In addition, high incidence and presence of pathologiesrelated to poor water quality are aggravated by weatherconditions and primitive basic drainage infrastructure.With regard to education, average lower school enrollmentand graduation is under 70 percent, while middleschool coverage is less than 15 percent (Aguirre, 2004).Displaced populations caught in the middle of the armed conflict, or whose lands have been affected byfumigation of illicit crops, presents still another challenge.Human rights violations because of the ongoing conflictcompound these challenges. The Social SolidarityNetwork of Caquet\u00e1 lists almost 7 927 displaced familiesor 38 000 displaced people (Aguirre, 2004). Since the creation of the 1991 Constitution, indigenous communities have their own legislation, 89 Ingano traditional food and health: Phase 1, 2004-2005Table 5.1 Most common Ingano botanical and faunal resources from the forest Common name Scientific name Family Uses Botanical resources Palma Guajo and timber Nacedero and meat Paujil Pet and meat Red handed tamarin Saguinuisniigrcollis - Pet and meat -No data.which allows them to ensure the existence and proper implementation of their traditional socio-politicalorganization. However, communities are not fullycapable of undertaking these processes and thereforeprotecting their culture and traditions. Lacking effectivevoice capable of dealing with the government and theoutside world in general, these communities continueto be isolated and receive little support for theirprogrammes and activities. Caquet\u00e1 is not properly covered by aqueduct or adequate sewer systems, especially in rural areas, andthis is one of the most significant causes of morbidity,gastrointestinal and diarrhoeal diseases. Aqueductdistribution networks have a 25 percent deficit in theurban area, and 60 percent in the rural area. \"Departmentmunicipalities do not have an efficient system thatallows them to properly dispose of solid residues.Although most of this work (62.5 percent) is carriedout through garbage collection, there are no adequatesanitary dump stations, but dumps with no kind ofcontrol or respect for environmental protection laws\"(Aguirre, 2004). The San Jose del Fragua Municipality traditionally belongs to the Ingano people, who arrived from PuertoLimon and Mocoa escaping Catholic missions andcolonization. The municipality was officially createdin 1985, although it had been established as a townas early as 1959 (Parra, 2004). The municipality islocated in eastern Caquet\u00e1, 37.28 miles south ofFlorencia. It covers 76 367 square miles, 540 m abovesea level. Its average temperature is 27 \u00b0C, with relativehumidity of 87 percent. Average precipitation is 3 500 mm a year. Yurayaco is located at 297 m abovesea level. The most important agricultural productsare banana, sugarcane, pineapple and corn. Othersignificant products The most common botanical and faunal resources from the forest (Parra, 2004) are shown in Table 5.1. Seven watersheds are found within the municipality's territory, most originating in the mountains. These rivers all flow into the Amazon. They are rich insediment and vegetable material. Deforestation alsocontributes to sediments entering the rivers. Because of the steepness of slopes, these rivers have a strongcurrent (Parra, 2004). As for health care, traditional indigenous medicine is widely accepted and practised. However, only 42percent of Ingano families receive healthcare aid.Typically, rural areas have the lowest access to westernhealthcare. Common diseases in Caquet\u00e1 include schistoso-miasis, Diarrhoealdiseases and respiratory infections also present especiallyhigh rates. Unfortunately, tuberculosis and some diseasesthat could be forestalled through immunization arepresent. Chronic non-transmissible diseases are notamong the most critical contributors to morbidity ormortality rates, but their incidence has been increasinglately (PAHO, 1994). Besides medical and dental assistance, the Departmental government provides some promotionand prevention activities, including the ExtendedImmunization Plan as required by national law. However,the indigenous populations receive even less of thisattention than other inhabitants of Caquet\u00e1. Ingano people Ingano indigenous communities in Caquet\u00e1 are organizedinto cabildos - the community's maximum authority -that elect a governor as well as a mayor, sheriff orconstable, secretary, treasurers and other necessaryofficers. These posts are elected by popular vote atindigenous assemblies: The Ingano come from several indigenous ethnos:the migratory groups living in the ColombianAmazonian piedmont come from the Peruvian andEcuadorean Amazon; those inhabiting the lowerPutumayo, known as Mocoas; and some are thelast survivors of the Andakies, fighting people thatnever surrendered to the Spanish conquerors. The most important settlement is located in Sibundoy Valley, located near the upper PutumayoRiver at 2 200 m over sea level. They also inhabitsome rural territories in the Departments ofPutumayo, Caquet\u00e1 and Cauca. However, their Indigenous Peoples' food systems |Ingano 90migratory spirit has led them to some of the big cities of Colombia and neighboring countries.Over the last few years, they have experienced agreat demographic recovery, and up to this moment35 000 Ingano people are estimated to livethroughout the country. The Ingano people speak the Inga language, a linguistic form of Quechua. There is no exactinformation about their Mocoas and Andakiesancestors' original dialect. With the latest colonizationmovement at the beginning of the last century andthe presence of Capuchin missionaries, Inganopeople were isolated and fragmented into fivegroups: a) those inhabiting at Sibundoy Valley, b) those at the neighboring regions of Mocoa, BajoPutumayo, c) those living in the Bota Caucana, d) those at the region of el Fragua in Caquet\u00e1, ande) those who have migrated to villages in Nari\u00f1o,Valle, Amazon, or to the big cities. This is thereason why the Ingano people are represented byseveral political Department, and Tanda ChiriduInganokuna in Caquet\u00e1. Besides their demographic recovery, the Inganos have managed to consolidate more than 18 reservations properly acknowledged by the state.Although these territories are relatively small, theyare distributed throughout the immense geographyof the Amazon piedmont. There are two main groups of Ingano people: the largest group, inhabiting the highlands, to be Andes\" people; other group inhabitsthe lowlands. geographic diversity has alsomade the cultural variety extremely significant,although both groups share language, traditions,and especially traditional medicine like the use ofmedicinal plants. (UMIYAC, 1999) Geographically, these communities are located at thewestern part of the Department. The territory is closeto Cauca and Putumayo Departments, only dividedby the Caquet\u00e1 and Fragua River that runs through the lower part of the Bota Caucana: The territorial occupation of the indigenous settlementsexemplifies how the community uses their land,for the Ingano people need the entire territory fortheir sustenance and recreation. Each family dailyuses basic elements of the surroundings to surviveand satisfy their needs. Each year, these communitiesoccupy around 4.94 acres for cultivation, using arotating cropping system in permanent crop areas. One of the most important cultural expressions of the Inganos is the \"Calusturinda\", carnival orparty in honour of the rainbow. This carnival takesplace during mid-February or beginnings of March,and it is considered the most important popularevent of the year. It is also called Atun Puncha, or\"big day\", and represents for the Ingano peoplethe beginning of the year, joy, reconciliation, andthe return of those who had left. Special dancingevents take place during this festivity. People drinkchicha [corn beer] and sing. Typical costumes arecolourful and there are lots of games and music.As for religious traditions, the most important riteis drinking Ambi Huasca or Yag\u00e9. This drink isobtained from the plant called [ayahuasca], and itis sacred and medicinal for the Ingano people. (Parra, 2004) Colombian nutritional condition According to statistics presented by UNICEF-Colombia,in terms of global malnutrition (weight/age), 10 percentof the country's population suffered from severemalnutrition or was below two standard deviationsduring 1990. This percentage went down to 8.4 percentin 1995 and to 6.7 percent in 2000. On the otherhand, 21 percent of the population was found to sufferfrom chronic malnutrition (height/age) during 1990,15 percent in 1995 and 13.5 percent in 2000. As foracute malnutrition (weight/age), there are no recordsfor 1990, but 1.4 percent was reported for 1995, and0.8 percent for 2000. UNICEF also declared Colombia free of iodine deficiencies in 1998, after establishing the presence of 91 Ingano traditional food and health: Phase 1, 2004-2005iodated salt in 91 percent of families, and just 7 percent of level I goitre, representing a very low risk for school-going age children. In Colombia, all wheat flour producedwithin the country must be fortified with iron, vitaminB 1, vitamin B2, niacin and folic acid. With regard to anaemia, 25 percent of children under five years presentedless than 11 g/dl haemoglobin in 1995, with those undertwo years of age being the most affected. The samepercentage was recorded for groups of women of repro-ductive age, with the percentage increasing to 43 percentin gestating women (UNICEF-Colombia, n.d.). These figures show an improvement in nutrition. However, rural areas located far from municipalityadministrative centres, such as in Caquet\u00e1 where manyInganos live, do not receive adequate attention orservices generally present the lowest of all health andnutrition indexes. Many of the positive changes observed in nutrition indexes are attributed to the National Nutrition Plandeveloped in Colombia for the period 1999 to 2005.Nevertheless, the important gap between different areas of the country cannot be ignored. The Caquet\u00e1Department, for example, has the second highestmalnutrition figures in the country (UNICEF-Colombia,n.d.). According to UNICEF:... death risk among children under five is extremelyhigh, as well as the possibility that their adequatedevelopment suffers serious limitations. Many oftoday's undernourished children did not receive thebenefits of breast milk, or belong to families whohave been displaced by the armed conflict. Womenin these families are often undernourished, incapableof hygienically caring for their babies, or otherwiseattending to their children. The Pacific Coast regionhas the highest figures of children under five sufferingfrom chronic malnutrition. In this region, for theyear 2000, only 12 percent of women were exclusivelybreastfeeding their children during the first sixmonths. This fact reveals that cultural practicesestablished by industries producing baby foodproducts during the 1960s or 1970s are very hardto change. (UNICEF-Colombia, 2007)Methodology We discussed, modified and signed with theindigenous leaders the collective consent that was drafted by the Centre for Indigenous Peoples'Nutrition and Environment (CINE): prior consultation,consensus decision-making and the protection of theirrights as indigenous communities were guaranteed.For the Inganos, the project was not considered research,but rather an instrument to improve and implementtheir Life Plan and to help them move towards cultural,environmental, productive, and community healthrecovery. Because of the civil conflict in Colombia thathas its epicentre in Caquet\u00e1 and Putumayo, the projectstrategy must be one of gradual extension and replicationon the part of the indigenous groups. On the otherhand, the Inganos do not recognize divisions betweenshamanism, health, diet, plants and nature. Therefore,the project was viewed as integrating all these issues ina holistic manner. Given the prior instances of exploitation and of abuse of intellectual property, the Inganos do notapprove of the collection of blood samples and subsequentmedical laboratory analysis. It is the opinion of theindigenous leaders that these types of projects shouldresult in better conditions for access to food and foodavailability than in diagnoses and documents. Initially,the expected project's development was hindered bythe occasional political difficulties that took place inthe area, obstructing access to the Ingano region. An interdisciplinary research team was created for the project, Nutrici\u00f3n y Alimentos T radicionales(T raditional Foods and Nutrition), which began itsactivities on 1 May 2004. The project was developedwith the communities belonging to the Asociaci\u00f3nde in theDepartment of Caquet\u00e1. The participating communitieswith which the group had established a previousrelationship signed a collaboration letter at the beginningof the project. The participation of each member wassubsequently established, presented and discussed.

A training workshop followed, which focusedon the development and management of surveyinstruments: data format, surveys, anthropometricanalysis and community workshops. Research in the community was conducted as outlined in the methodology from CINE (www.mcgill.ca/cine/research/global.pdf). Research activitiescomprised focus groups to determine species in thetraditional food list, and the ways that the Ingano foodsare perceived and used. In addition, interviews with34 women and 8 men, including several shamans, were completed. T wenty-four hour diet recalls wereconducted with adults. Anthropometry was conductedon 116 individuals - 43 children (0-12 years) and 73 adolescents/adults (>12 years) - with standard scalesand tape measures used in health clinics in the region.Several discussions were held with an additional 20-25 adult Ingano community leaders and healthpersonnel, and existing reports on traditional medicineswere reviewed. Excel formats were used to enter a list of traditional foods to make the information easy to handle andprocess. Individual interviews with people belongingto the Ingano culture elaborated the food information.Food classification according to traditional attributesor categories was derived from personal interviews.Particularly emphasized were the hot and cold foods,the irritating and soothing foods, and the tonic andpurgative foods. Results Over 160 types of food were described. Somewere varieties of the same species, and, in some cases, parts of the same species were referred toseparately. The research on traditional food confirmedthe loss of many traditional resources, especiallygame animals and fish, insects and tubers, roots,seeds and leaves of indigenous plants. These foodshave been divided according to the suggestion offocus groups in the following categories: small animals,big animals, traditional animals, traditional furryanimals, monkeys, insects, birds, small fish, big fish,traditional fish, palm trees, platanos (varieties ofbanana), fruits, root foods, other plants, carbohydratesand cereals. This division allowed clarification ofsome characteristics of the classified species. Theavailability calendar of most of these foods was notespecially significant. Since the communities arelocated in tropical areas, weather variations are notdrastic enough to be distinctive. However, wildspecies do appear in specific seasons, while thosethat are grown are available depending on wherethey are planted.

Amongthese communities this species is usedas raw material to create or preparemultiple products: medicines, oil,chichi and milk (Balick and Anderson, 1986). Nutritional characteristics Oil extracted from this palm is similarto olive oil. The main differencebetween these two is that this palm oilhas three times less linoleic acid thanolive oil. In the Amazonian region, milk obtainedthrough a maceration process of theflesh of the palm is consumed verywidely. The milk's protein content iscomparable to that from an animal aswell as to the majority of the grainsand leguminous; the biological valueof this protein is similar to that of the casein. The \"milk\" of the seje iscomparable to the human one in itscontent of fat, proteins andcarbohydrates - its caloric contentprovides 55.3 % of calories of the oils,7.41 % of protein and 37.3 % ofcarbohydrates (D\u00ecaz y \u00c1vila, 2002).The of fruitis (1):Protein: 8 gFat: 12 gFiber: 15 And in pulp - husk: Protein: 4 g Fat: 28 g Fiber: 3 g >Balick, M.J. & Anderson, A.B. 1986.

Zuluaga, P., J.J. characteristics This plant is native to the northwestAmazon and is valued as both astimulant and a medicine Traditionally,it has been valued as a stimulant bythe Indigenous Peoples at thesoutheast of Colombia, Ecuador andPeru. The stem, mixed with cold water,produces a mixture of chocolate-likecolour. The Putumayo Indians consumethis at dawn, and usually eat nothingmore until noon. After consuming justone or two cups, representingapproximately 100g of the extractedmaterial, hunger disappears for at least3 hours, while muscles continue to bestimulated.Reported to be antipyretic, purgative,stimulant and tonic, yoco is used byvillagers to treat dysentery, fever,malaria and stomach ache. Among thePutumayo people, this plant is alsoused in higher doses to treat malaria fever and biliary disorders. Etnobotanic and etnomedical information:In the western Amazon of Colombia,in Ecuador and northern Peru, manytribes use yoco daily as stimulant andoccasionally to treat fever. Although it is not food, this is a plant that makesop part of the indigenous diet.Because it is known only from thewild, deforestation and over-harvestingare endangering the plant. The Kofans, Sionas, Secoyas scrape thebark of the stems and macerate themin cold water to ease hunger andfatigue. According to Garc\u00eda-Barriga(1992), the traditional preparationentails taking well-formed stems andcutting them into pieces from 40 cmto 50 cm long (approximately 15 to 16 in). They clean the external barkand then scrape it, obtaining shavingsequivalent to approximately 10 cm (4 in) of the liana. This amountcorresponds to an approximate dose of5g of bark. They then place theshavings in cold water and, using theirhands, rub them together until thewater turns milky. After straining outthe bark, the beverage is then ready tobe consumed. This drink has a milkyreddish color and is astringent andsour. Indigenous Peoples of the Ingano-Kams\u00e1 community in Colombia believethat yoco can also be used of the EcuadorianAmazon, this plant is used as astimulant, to treat malaria, and to treatmost fevers in general including thePaullinia emetica . This effect is due to the saponin content of the plant (Schultes, 1987). Nutritional characteristics There is no available data on itsnutritional structure, but itscomponents classify it as a medicinalplant, since the main component iscaffeine (12%), mineral matter and diverse alkaloids. >EcoAldea .

It appears reasonable to consider that the good health attributedto these indigenous populations prior to contact hasto (in part, at least) be strongly related to traditionaldiet, which has been disrupted by contact with theoutside world. Primary meat processing and storage techniques were salting and smoking. Many of the listed foodswere only eaten fresh; food gathering among the Inganoswas carried out on a daily basis, and most of these foodswere consumed relatively quickly. For food-analysis sampling, priority was given to those with potentially high nutritional value. Of the19 foods chosen for additional analysis, we learnedboth from the literature and the lab that the followingspecies are nutritionally important and need to be apart of the current and future diet:1 Ca\u00f1a agria : bitter cane employed in the preparation of refreshing drinks. 2Cayamba : large and tasty edible mushroom. 3Churo : edible riverside snail. 4Cimarr\u00f3n : edible and medicinal herb. 5Cucha : edible fish. 6Milpesos : Palm tree fruit used for consumption and for edible oil. 7Mojojoy : edible beetle larva from fallen palm trunks. 8Yoco: liana used to prepare stimulating beverage. Some elements of important traditional foods are presented in Table 5.3. Samples were sought for laboratoryanalysis of at San Miguel del Fragua, at a height of540 metres above sea level, by Fabio Quevedo in February2005, following all the technical specifications suggestedby the laboratory. Table 5.3 presents laboratory resultsin dry weight of these food items. A literature search of nutrient values of selected key Ingano food species was conducted, and results arepresented in Table 5.4. The need for further work onnutrient composition of Ingano food samples is evidentfrom the lack of published data. 101 Ingano traditional food and health: Phase 1, 2004-2005>Siamazonia (Sistema de la de Colombia: bot\u00e1nicam\u00e9dica.

Following the selection of attributes, thesame foods were used to derive a taste-appreciation scorefor children and adults on a 5-point scale. Table 5.5reports the average scores for each food. With thisinformation it was then possible to summarize attributesof each of the foods (Table 5.6). It is clear that these foods were well accepted and that both children and adults enjoyed them. In somecases, the taste of certain items may not have been verypleasant, but their importance to the community wasconsiderable. Nutrition of infants, children and adults Interviews conducted with mothers about the nutritionhistory of infants revealed that breastfeeding wasprevalent with cessation from 3-24 months. Complementary food was given early in life. Manychildren were already taking complementary foodsafter the first month, and almost all of them had thesefoods after the fourth month. Milk formula andsupplements were used rarely. Complementary foodin the infant diet was initiated gradually, generally wellaccepted and did not produce any health problems. In the 24-hour dietary surveys, it was found that food diversity was good but somewhat limited becauseof the scarcity of food resources (including traditionalfoods) obtained from the surroundings. Also importantwere the financial difficulties limiting access to otherhigh-quality foods from markets. Using dietary recallsto understand the significance of market food sources,the percentage of dietary energy from both traditionalfood and market sources was calculated (Table 5.7).Of total daily dietary energy, 58 percent of children'sdiets and 47 percent of women's diets comprisedtraditional Ingano food. Results of the anthropometry assessment of Inganos are given in Table 5.8. It can be seen that the populationrepresented the early stages of the nutrition transitionwhere most children are normal in their height and weight,but that underweight (low weight-for-height) and stunting(low height-for-age) are present, and there was littlechildhood overweight or obesity. At the same time, theincidence of overweight and obese adults was evident. Summary of the current situation The research has shown that at the time of theresearch an impressive diversity of traditional food resources from the local environment were known andconsumed by Ingano families. While commercial foodwas encroaching, the majority of dietary energy wasstill derived from traditional Ingano food. These localresources were highly regarded by adults and childrenalike for their many attributes. Environmental concernsfor the local food-producing areas are significant. A meeting was held with project personnel to evaluate the project's development, executed activitiesand participation of the work group, as well as toestablish the expectations for the future.

Since the topic was interesting,the work was easily done, especially because Elders liketo share this information, although they are alwayscautious when doing so to protect their traditionalknowledge. Indigenous authorities were also supportiveand made it easy to access the communities and to carry out individual and group activities. Problems the group encountered were also discussed during the meeting. One topic was the rejection andwariness that domiciliary visits and surveys sometimescaused. The reason for this reaction was that manymembers of the community were not aware of theoverall purpose of the research and the benefits it 103 Ingano traditional food and health: Phase 1, 2004-2005Table 5.6 Summary of attributes by Inganos for key Ingano traditional foods Traditional food name Attributes Aj\u00ed Its use is a tradition.

Some didn't want to participate because they believed the project wasonly trying to obtain information that depreciatedindigenous groups. The community work group as a whole considered that this project had gathered information that is ofgreat importance if the traditional elements are to berescued, in order to make the community moreindependent from external markets, when it comes tohealth and nutrition. Looking to the future of the project Project participants involved in evaluation meetingssuggested that all activities should be carried out with the support of community leaders. In this way, acceptanceand understanding of this project and its objectives canbe assured. Another suggestion was to share projectmethods with all Ingano communities in the region. Community work must try to involve everyone: Elders, women, adults, young people and children. Itis also necessary to create campaigns designed to promotethe protection of the resources the community alreadyhas, as well as trying to recover what has been lost ordamaged. This is only possible by creating awareness(especially among young people) and improving technicalmanagement of crops and wild species. Nineteen Ingano traditional foods were chosen for promotion and recovery for the following reasons: T raditional: foods that were part of the traditional diet. Nutritive: foods known for their nutritive value (protein, polyunsaturated fats and importantmicronutrients). Necessary: foods that have not been replaced or that serve a fundamental role in the cosmovision of theculture. Available: foods that are easy to obtain. Enjoyable: foods that will be eaten and enjoyed by the communities. Affordable: foods that are inexpensive to obtain.Ingano representatives who attended planning sessionsrequested that: (1) crops of the ancestral foods becultivated, (2) an environmental protection plan forthe ecosystems required to maintain these food resourcesbe designed, (3) support or subsidy be offered towardthe acquisition of the crops obtained from the gardensmaintained in the traditional agriculture programme,(4) a Nutritional and Epidemiological MonitoringSystem to monitor the condition of the participatingpopulation, and (5) a programme be established topromote the consumption of traditional food. Thesemeasures should be included in the education offeredto the indigenous persons in the Yachaicury School sothat they may serve as \"multipliers\" of this information,beyond the activity in community workshops carriedout by the promoters and the professional team. Discussion One of the characteristics of the crisis the world iscurrently undergoing is the loss of diversity, both biological and cultural. With this loss, threats to shamanism Indigenous Peoples' food systems |Ingano 104Table 5.8 Nutritional status by age group Age groups Prevalence (percentage) 3-6 years old (n = 13) Underweight 19.1 Stunted 21.8 Wasted 2.2 Overweight 0.0 Obese 4.3 7-12 years old (n = 16) Underweight 21.3 Stunted 38.4 Wasted 1.6 Overweight 0.0 Obese 1.6 Women BMI (n = 39) < 25 (normal) 89.2 25-29.9 (overweight) 8.1 30 (obese) 2.7 Men BMI (n = 34) < 25 (normal) 96.6 25-29.9 (overweight) 3.4 30 (obese) 0.0- a belief system central to the well-being of many indigenous groups - can be seen. This is important fora world that seems to have lost the way in its effort tomaintain health and respect the natural world. The problems our societies are currently facing result from a tendency to homogenize culture (underestimatingthe traditional values of peasan t groups and Indigenous Peoples). We face crises in health services management,serious contamination problems and dramatic loss ofbiodiversity. Also damaging is the reductionist perspectiveof scientific thought, and in ethical terms, the secularizationof human culture. To overcome these problems, a long-term social transformation is required. First of all, it is importantto strengthen the scientific and technological advancesaccomplished during the twenty-first century, thecreation of new paradigms, and incorporation of newscientific perspectives regarding the world and humanswho live in it. The growing awareness on the \"environ-mental problem\" has encouraged a search for urgentsolutions. After its timid appearance with the ecologicmovements of the 1970s, this awareness first evolvedinto an \"ecodevelopment\" proposal (UNEP , 1972) andfinally into the concept of \"sustainable development\",which is understood as the development that satisfiesthe needs of the present generation without compromisingthe capacity of future generations to satisfy their ownneeds (United Nations, 2002). This concept is still inforce, despite the conceptual divergences and conflictsof interests that surround it. Sustainable development policies have followed four main lines: 1) preservation and/or recovery ofecosystems and flora and fauna diversity in severalregions of the world; 2) application of economic modelsthat encourage a decrease on the economic growth; 3) creation of new technologies considered as soft, clearor less contaminant; and 4) control of demographicgrowth. Thus, the following question arises: would Indigenous Peoples prefer to disappear as a culture if they lose thesense of collective property and/or their shamanicsystems? Shamanism cannot be strictly defined asmedicine, although healing is its main objective. Strangeceremonies and rituals, chants and dances, colourfuloutfits, perfuming with incense and invocations are part of the shamanic world. The shamanic functionsare characterized by a deep sense of the sacred, greatwisdom regarding nature, utilization of trance-inducingtechniques, and a strong belief in other worlds; it alsoimplies consumption of plants that are regarded assacred (wrongly called hallucinogenic), and a vastknowledge on the medicinal properties of plants. Forthe Western world, the shamanic universe remainsstrange and mysterious (UMIYAC, 1999). The pillar of the indigenous culture and its productive systems is shamanism. In those groups where the shamandisappears or loses his authority, and the traditionalmedicine man loses validity, extinction and acculturationare more serious and immediate. That is why any social,environmental, cultural, economic or politic developmentproject should start by strengthening the shamanicinstitution and the traditional medicine system. Theindigenous culture highly depends upon the survivalof shamanism. Therefore, - and this should be consideredby all bioprospecting programmes - strengthening ofthe shamanic institution is paramount to the conservationof cultural diversity. Actions that seek to preservetraditional societies are crucial: It is necessary to value and protect cultural diversity,because of the alarming current diminishment ofthe little adaptative social forms still existing. Tolose and destroy civilizing systems implies losingunique models of social, political, economic, andlinguistic organization, as well as intellectual,scientific, artistic and philosophic expressions...Cultural diversity is as important as biologic diversity:they both guarantee the wealth of life forms...Cultural pluralism is paramount to a biosocialevolution that optimizes all life forms and culturalcreativity... Cultural diversity increases all humancreativities in order to achieve different forms ofcollective coexistence. (Bar\u00f3n et al., 1995) Environmental conservation policies face the conflictof focusing either on biologic or cultural conservation.There are very few experiences that integrate bothconcepts. For indigenous traditional medicine, healthimplies harmony or equilibrium of reality. The human 105 Ingano traditional food and health: Phase 1, 2004-2005being is not just a body, but also thoughts, memories, emotions and spirituality. This harmony also refers tosocial relationships: family, neighbourhood, community;and finally, it also means harmony between and withinnature, harmony among vegetables, animals, the invisiblebeings and sacred places. It could be stated then thatthe concept of health within the indigenous traditionalmedicine focuses on the triad person-society-nature that greatly exceeds the current definition of modernmedicine. The Western perspective typically refers only to the extrinsic values, while the indigenous perspectiverefers to intrinsic values. Both the orthodox approachof modern economics and the environmentalist discourserefer to the concept of development. Progressive economicgrowth or sustainable development always implies\"development\". The modern economic model seeks tomeasure development through an indicator known asUnsatisfied Basic Needs (UBN), 2which - through a series of complex calculations - includes categories ofmaterial character: housing, access to public services,transportation, formal education level, consumptioncapacity (electrical household appliances and luxurygoods), among others (UNDP , 1996). But the UBNdoes not consider other \"unsatisfied basic needs\" thatmight be intangible but not because of that, lessimportant. We're talking about health, joy, production methods, access to formal and informal educationsystems, capacity to develop the need of transcendenceand finding the meaning of life. The Indigenous Peoples have managed to remember that \"life\" is not just about consumption, welfare andacquisition of material goods. Their cosmovision, theirway of life with a collective property perspective, andtheir easy access to other awareness levels that bring atranscendence feeling are lessons that should not beforgotten at the moment of negotiating or establishingthe concept of development. Culture, nature and health To understand the indigenous analysis of reality,the perspective Culture-Nature-Health can be utilized (Figure 5.2) (Zuluaga, 1998). Culture here refers to cosmovisions, production methods, form of social relationships and the interpretationof daily reality. Nature refers to natural resources,defined as the vegetable, animal and mineral kingdomby the western culture, and as \"mother earth\" - a moreglobal concept - by the Indigenous Peoples. However,to understand the interrelationship between the threeconcepts, one cannot fragment the analysis intoindependent categories. In this perspective, culture is studied by social sciences, nature by biological sciences, and health byhealth sciences. There is still missing an interdisci-plinary science that considers these aspects as a wholeand not as the arithmetic sum of each discipline, notonly when dealing with the indigenous reality, but withreality at any level. There are four interstices among the three circles. It is precisely in those spaces where new reflection andwork strategies for environmental, social and healthprojects can be found:1. Relationship health-nature: This firstly refers to nature's health or health of the ecosystems, meaningthe state of biologic resources. It secondly refers tothe important role that environment plays on thematter of human health.

Finally, there is a close relation-ship between health and nature, established throughmore reliance on traditional medicinal plants.Indigenous shamans and traditional medicine menand women are masters of these medicinal plants.And these sacred plants play an essential role incultural maintenance and well-being. 2.Relationship nature-culture: Although biology also refers to culture when talking about animalbehaviour - well known by shamans - this categorymust be considered with respect to nature andhuman culture. This is how cultural ecology startsto discover the important role of environmentand resource availability in the development ofcultural, ethic and power manifestations of humansocieties. It is surprising to examine the originrites of many tribal peoples, who consider thedomestication of a plant the genesis of their society;that is the case of the Maya people, who considerthemselves to be \"sons of corn\", or of severalAmazon peoples that call themselves \"sons ofyuca\", etc. Ethnobiology is precisely the disciplinewhich seeks to study the interrelationship betweennature and human culture in its different branches(ethnobotanics, ethnoecology, etc.), 3.Relationship culture-health: T raditional medicine is understood as the medicine system used byindigenous or peasant communities to managehealth and sickness. Contrary to modern medicineand psychiatry, traditional medicine considersillnesses to be more than body or mind problems;they also include work or marital difficulties, badluck in hunting and fishing activities, or badrelationships with others. 4.Relationship health-nature-culture: Western scientific thinking and its several disciplines stilllack a science able to approach the integrality ofthe three relationships, but authentic shamanic systems can teach us about this integration ofconcepts. We have to accept our condition oflisteners and apprentices of the indigenous Elders'wisdom, and listen to what they have to explainabout a reality that does not admit differencesbetween culture, nature and health. For centuries, Indigenous Peoples have managed toobtain from the forests satisfaction for all of their needs- including culture and spirituality - without destroyingthese ecosystems. This type of intervention has beencalled \"anthropogenic forest\" \"humanized forest\"(Correa, 1993). The process of \"humanization\" of theforest has been led by the Elders of communities.Availability of sacred, stimulant and medicinal plants,the overlapping of natural resources with \"invisiblepeople\", the establishment of annual calendars basedon ecologic events characteristic of the forest, the ethiccodes for fishing, hunting and gathering of wild fruits,and a frugal use that guarantees resource sustainability- among others - are characteristic elements ofshamanism for territorial ordering and sustainable useof resources. Each culture, within its process of historicdevelopment, has identified different ways to facefundamental problems... As for the specific problemof sickness, we can identify very particular categories,models, ideas, practices, etc., that depend on thecosmovision, social and economic history andgeographic conditions - nature - of each culture.That's why the answer to those problems is notnecessarily identical or valid for every culture. (PAHO, 1995) On the other hand, it is also evident that youngerindigenous generations, due to their more frequentcontact with modern society, are leaving aside or failingto learn many of their traditions and productionsystems. Acculturation, as a result of governments'influences and classic models of western development,is a common phenomenon among all IndigenousPeoples. It is necessary to recover, cultivate and protect the food and medicinal resources: germplasm banks, botanicgardens, house gardens and greenhouses can be used 107 Ingano traditional food and health: Phase 1, 2004-2005to reinforce species propagation. At the same time, we need to protect cultural memory that strengthenstraditional medicine. Dialogue is necessary amongmedicine men and women, midwives, and herbalistsin order to transmit traditional values and techniquesto younger generations .
