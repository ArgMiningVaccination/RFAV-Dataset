They are recognized as the primary neurotoxic agents in Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms underlying such toxicity on synaptic functions are complex and not fully understood. Here, we provide the firstevidence that these mechanisms involve protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Using a novel transgenic mouse model expressing human APP withthe Swedish and Arctic mutations that render A /H9252more prone to form oligomers (arcA /H9252mice), we show that the LTP impairment induced by A/H9252oligomers can be fully reversed by PP1 inhibition in vitro . We further demonstrate that the genetic inhibition of endogenous PP1 in vivo confers resistance to A /H9252oligomer-mediated toxicity and preserves LTP. Overall, these results reveal that PP1 is a key player in the mechanisms of AD pathology. Key words: impairment; PP1; oligomers; A /H9252-peptide; Alzheimer's progress in the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has pro- vided evidence that amyloid /H9252(A/H9252) oligomers rather than /H9252-amyloid plaques are the major toxic agents in the pathology of the disease (Selkoe, 2002). A /H9252oligomers have been demonstrated to disrupt synaptic plasticity and impair memory (Lambert et al.,1998; Walsh et al., 2002; Oddo et al., 2003; Lesne et al., 2006) andare known to accumulate in the brain of AD patients (Takahashiet al., 2002). Therapeutic strategies developed to interfere withA /H9252deposition and clearance have shown initial benefit in AD patients and rodent models (Hock et al., 2003; Klyubin et al.,2005; Schenk et al., 2005). Neutralization of A /H9252toxicity, for in- stance, was found to reverse memory deficits in a mouse model ofAD without altering /H9252-amyloid plaque load (Dodart et al., 2002). Many studies have attempted to determine the mechanisms by which A /H9252assemblies disrupt synaptic plasticity and mediate their detrimental effect, but the actual pathways that couple A /H9252toxicity to synaptic functions remain only partially understood. Arecently identified mechanism implicates specific interactionsbetween A /H9252and neurotransmitter receptors such as the NMDA (Snyder et al., 2005; Kelly and Ferreira, 2006) and /H9251-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Oddo and LaFerla, 2006). This mecha-nism recruit the Ca 2/H11001-dependent protein phos- phatase calcineurin (PP2B) (Chen et al., 2002; Snyder et al., 2005;Kelly and Ferreira, 2006), a finding in line with the hypothesisthat Ca 2/H11001signaling is disrupted by A /H9252neurotoxicity (Demuro et al., 2005). To investigate whether other major signaling pathways down- stream of the NMDA receptor are implicated in the mechanismsof A /H9252toxicity in vivo , we generated a transgenic mouse model expressing a human amyloid precursor protein (APP) with theSwedish and Arctic mutations (arcA /H9252mice) that produces a form of A/H9252more prone to yield A /H9252oligomers (Knobloch et al., 2007). In these mice, expression of the mutant APP induces punctateintraneuronal A /H9252deposition in several brain areas and severe behavioral deficits before the onset of extracellular /H9252-amyloid plaque deposition. Using this model, we show here that the over-production of Arctic A /H9252is associated with an age-dependent impairment in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) andsynaptic plasticity in vitro that involves protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, we demonstratethat both the pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of PP1 in vitro andin vivo reverse the defect in synaptic plasticity induced by A /H9252 oligomers. These results strongly support a major role for PP1 in the mechanisms of A /H9252oligomer-mediated toxicity and demon- strate its reversibility in adult animals. Materials and Methods Animals.

ArcA /H9252 mice express human APP 695 carrying both the Swedish (K670N; M671L) and the Arctic (E693G) mutations in a single construct underthe control of the prion protein promoter. APPSwe/PS1 mice carry ahuman APP with the Swedish mutation and a mutant presenilin 1(M146L). I-1* mutant mice carry a transgene expressing an control of the II /H9251) promoter and a tetO promoter fused to I1* cDNA. Mice were kept under standard housing conditions on a re-versed 12 h light/dark cycle with food and water ad libitum . Seven to nine days before the experiments, I-1* mutant mice and control littermates(carrying only the tetO-I-1* transgene) were fed doxycycline (West-Ward Pharmaceuticals, Eatontown, NJ) at 6 mg/g of food. All animalexperiments were performed in accordance with guidelines of the Swissveterinary cantonal office (licenses Nr 150/06 and 123/04). Electrophysiological recordings. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and then decapitated. Heads were immediately immersed in ice-coldfreshly prepared artificial CSF (aCSF) for at least 2 min before brainextraction. Acute slices (400 /H9262m thick) were prepared with a vibratome (VT 1000S; Leica Microsystems, Bannockburn, IL) were incubated in aCSF at 34\u00b0C for 20 min and then keptat room temperature for at leas t 1 h before recording. Recording was performed in an interface chamber continuously flowed with aCSF at 1.1ml/min. A monopolar electrode was placed in the Schaffer collaterals,and stimulation was applied at 0.033 Hz with stimulus intensity rangingfrom 20 to 80 /H9262A, yielding evoked field EPSPs (fEPSPs) of 0.2-0.5 V. fEPSPs were recorded in the stratum radiatum using a borosilicate mi-cropipette filled with aCSF. The signal was amplified with an Axopatch200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA), digitized by a Digi- data 1200 interface (Molecular Devices) and sampled at 10 kHz withClampex 8.2 (Molecular Devices). aCSF was composed of the following(in m M): 119 NaCl, D-glucose, 2.5 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3, gassed with O2/CO2(95/5%) at least 20 min before use and throughout the experiment. Baseline was recorded for a minimum of 20 min or until stable. Plasticity was then induced by stim-ulation with either 1 Hz for 15 min (900 pulses), 2 Hz for 10 min (1200pulses), 5 Hz for 3 min (900 pulses), 10 Hz for 1.5 min (900 pulses), or100 Hz for three trains o f 1 s tetanus separated by 20 s. Data were analyzed by measuring the slope of individual fEPSPs at 1-1.5 ms after the stimu-lus pulse by linear fitting using Clampfit (Molecular Devices). Thefrequency-dependent plasticity curve (BCM curve) was built by deter-mining mean fEPSP slopes over 10 min starting 35 min after stimulation(according to Jouvenceau et al., 2006). Reverse transcription and quantitative real-time PCR. Total RNA was isolated from frozen /H9252mice (Invitrogen, CA) and cleaned up with RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). First-strand cDNA was the SuperScript (Invitrogen) (ABI PRISM SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems, GGCATCTT-GGGCTACACTGAG; CGAAGGTGGAAGAGTGGGAG. Data was according to the /H9004/H9004Ct method, normal- ized to /H9252-actin and GAPDH. Statistical analysis was performed on the /H9004Ct values using Student's ttest. Passive immunization. Three-month-old arcA immunized with single intraperitoneal injection (10 mg/kg) of either purified 6E10(Signet, Dedham, MA) or negative control antibody for mouse IgG1(Lab Vision, Fremont, CA) 48 h before slice preparation. Tautomycin application. Slices from 3-month-old arcA /H9252mice, wild- type APPSwe/PS1 mice in normal aCSF oraCSF containing 1 n Mtautomycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for at least 1 h before recording. PP1 activity assay. Activity of recombinant PP1 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and calcineurin (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) wasmeasured with and without 1 n Mtautomycin using a modified Biomol Green Assay kit (Biomol). Western blot analysis of phospho-CaMKII levels. Mice were perfused transcardially with ice-cold PBS, and hippocampi were dissected andimmediately frozen in dry ice. Crude synaptic membrane fractions wereprepared according to Genoux et al. (2002). Equal amount of proteinswas loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulosemembrane, and blocked in TBS containing 1% BSA 4\u00b0C, and the corresponding secondary anti-bodies were incubated for 1.5 h at room temperature. Commercial ECL(GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) was used for the detection of chemilu-minescence. Densitometric analysis was performed using the free down-loadable ImageJ software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). A /H9252oligomer preparation and application. A/H9252oligomers were prepared according to Klein (2002). Synthetic A /H92521-42(Bachem, King of Prussia, PA) was dissolved in Hexafluor2-propanol (HFIP), aliquoted, and kept at/H1100280\u00b0C after evaporation of HFIP. A /H9252oligomers were prepared freshly by dissolving the above peptide film with DMSO and diluting it into coldF12 medium without phenol red to yield a 100 /H9262Mstock. This prepara- tion was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 24 h and centrifuged at 14,000 /H11003gfor 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and the supernatant was further used for electrophysiologicalexperiments according to Wang et al. (2002). Slices were bathed for atleast1hi n aCSF containing either A /H9252oligomers (1:200 diluted) or, as a control, phenol red-free F12 medium only (1:200 diluted). To prevent awashout of A /H9252oligomers during recording, the aCSF used for perfusion contained dilution red-free F12, respec- tively. Each A /H9252oligomer preparation was used for one I-1* mutant mouse and a corresponding control in parallel, measured in a blindedmanner. Electron microscopy. The A /H9252oligomer preparation was controlled by elec- tron microscopy. Five acid for 45 s, and viewed witha Philips CM12 scanning transmission electron microscope. Results Severe impairment in synaptic plasticity in arcA /H9252mice To evaluate the we first measured hippocampal LTP in area CA1 in vitro by recording fEPSPs in acute slices from adult arcA /H9252mice and wild-type lit- termates after induction. The LTP deficitwas not caused by impaired synaptic transmission, because basaltransmission was normal in the transgenic slices (Fig. 1 A,B, in- set). It did not result from a developmental defect caused bytransgene expression either, because both LTP (Fig. 1 C) and basal synaptic transmission (Fig. 1 C, inset) were normal in slices from 1-month-old mice, consistent with the fact that A /H9252accumulation is not detectable at this age despite high expression of mutantAPP (Knobloch et al., 2007). We confirmed that the LTP deficitwas caused by A /H9252oligomers by showing that it could be reversed with a single dose of an antibody directed against the A /H9252sequence (6E10) administered to the animals 48 h before LTP induction(supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.jneurosci.org as supple-Knobloch et al. PP1 Is Involved in A /H9252-Mediated LTP Impairment J. Neurosci., July 18, 2007 27(29):7648 -7653 7649mental material). The antibody treatment restored LTP in transgenic slices to /H1101185% level of potentiation compared with slicesfrom wild-type littermates. A control anti-body of the identical IgG class against anonrelated antigen failed to rescue LTP(supplemental Fig. 1, available at www.j-neurosci.org as supplemental material). Inaddition to a deficit in plasticity at highinduction frequency (100 Hz for LTP),stimulation frequencies slices. at 1 or 2 Hzstimulation frequency was not changed(Fig. 2 D). These results reveal a deficit in plasticity across a wide range of stimula-tion frequencies with a shift of responsestoward synaptic depression. To examine whether candidate genes involved in synaptic signaling may under-lie the impairment in plasticity induced byA /H9252oligomers, we measured the level of expression of several candidate genes byreal-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR.Hippocampal expression of synaptophy-sin, a or CaMKII, a major proteinkinase necessary for the induction of LTP(Lisman et al., 2002), was not altered inarcA /H9252mice (Fig. 1 D). However, because intracellular Ca2/H11001signaling is altered by A/H9252oligomers, it is likely that Ca2/H11001-dependent posttranslational processes such as protein phosphorylation are perturbed. There- fore, we examined whether phosphorylation of CaMKII ischanged in arcA /H9252mice. Western blot analyses revealed a decrease in the level of phosphorylated CaMKII in synaptic membranes fromarcA /H9252mice (supplemental Fig. 2, available at www.jneurosci.org as supplemental material), suggesting a perturbation in protein kinase/phosphatase pathways. Furthermore, the expression of transcriptionfactors rapidly activated after neuronal activity and required for LTP,arg3.1/arc and zif268 (Worley et al., 1991; Link et al., 1995; Guzowskiet al., 2000), was significantly reduced in arcA /H9252mice (Fig. 1 D)[p/H11021 0.05; ttest; mean and 67% (58-78%); A /H9252oligomers alter protein phosphorylation and the activation of immediate early genes (IEGs). In vitro inhibition of PP1 reverses A /H9252oligomer-mediated plasticity impairmentBecause PP1 is major protein phosphatase in neurons that neg-atively regulates intracellular signaling downstream receptor Shenolikar, 2006),we examined whether it might be involved in the deficit in plas-ticity induced by A /H9252oligomers. PP1 was inhibited pharmacolog- littermates using the selective inhibitor tautomycin (1 n M), and the effect on plasticity was examined across several stimulationfrequencies. Remarkably, PP1 inhibition was found to fully re-verse the deficit in plasticity observed at 5, 10, or 100 Hz in arcA /H9252 slices (Fig. 2 A,D)(p/H110210.05; repeated-measurement ANOVA) but had no effect on plasticity in wild-type slices (Fig. 2 B)(p/H110050.3; repeated-measurement ANOVA). This rescuing effect resulted spe-cifically from PP1 inhibition and did not involve the protein phos-phatase calcineurin because only PP1 activity was significantlyinhibited by 1 n Mtautomycin (Fig. 2 C), confirming that PP1- dependent mechanisms are involved in the plasticity deficit. To confirm the rescuing effect of PP1 inhibition observed in arcA/H9252mice, we examined whether it could be reproduced in another transgenic mouse model of AD. We tested the well estab-lished APPSwe/PS1 model that expresses human APP carryingthe Swedish mutation and a mutated Presenilin1 and exhibits anearly AD pathology associated with marked behavioral deficits(Holcomb et al., 1998). Similarly to arcA /H9252mice, CA1 LTP was severely impaired an-imals and was significantly rescued by Mtau- tomycin) (Fig. 2 E)(p/H110210.05; repeated-measurement ANOVA). The rescue was however less pronounced than in arcA /H9252mice, possibly because of higher production of the more toxic A /H92521-42as a result of the presenilin mutation in APPSwe/PS1. Together, these results strongly suggest that PP1 is a critical factor in thecourse of A /H9252-mediated toxicity. Inhibition of endogenous PP1 in vivo confers resistance to A/H9252oligomer-mediated toxicity To assess whether the detrimental effect of PP1 is also reversiblein vivo , we examined (right inset).

We took advantage of a transgenic mousemodel in which PP1 is selectively inhibited (by 40-60%) in fore-brain neurons by expression of a constitutively active of inhibitor-1 (I-1*) (Genoux et Michalon et from adult I-1* transgenic mice were exposedto A /H9252oligomers produced from synthetic A /H92521-42. This prepara - tion A /H9252oligomers contained globular A /H9252assemblies of 7-12 nm diameter (Fig. 3 A), as previously described (Klein, 2002). To verify that our preparation of A /H9252oligomers had the reported inhibitory effect on LTP (Wang et al., 2002), we bathed slicesfrom wild-type mice in aCSF containing A /H9252oligomers (0.5 /H9262Mof the initial peptide) or normal aCSF. As expected, A /H9252oligomers strongly impaired the induction of LTP in slices from wild-typemice, and fEPSPs returned to baseline within 10 min after tetanicstimulation (Fig. 3 B). Likewise, A /H9252oligomers impaired LTP in slices from I-1* control littermates (Fig. 3 C)(p/H110210.05; repeated- measurement ANOVA). However, in slices from I-1* transgenicmice, A /H9252oligomers did not prevent the induction of LTP, which was robust and stable (Fig. 3 D)(p/H110050.6; repeated-measurement ANOVA comparing LTP with and without A /H9252oligomers). These results therefore indicate that PP1 inhibition in vivo confers pro- tection against A /H9252oligomer-mediated toxicity. Discussion This study demonstrates that the inhibitory effects of A /H9252oli- gomers on hippocampal LTP in the adult brain are reversible andthat normal LTP can be restored by PP1 inhibition in vitro in independent mouse models of AD (arcA /H9252mice and APPSwe/PS1mice). It also reveals that in addition to LTP induced by 100 Hz stimulation, A intermediate 10 Hz) and induce a general shift insynaptic responses toward depression that,similar to LTP, byPP1 inhibition. Endogenous PP1 inhibi-tionin vivo is further shown to the impairment of LTP induced by A /H9252oli- gomers, providing strong evidence thatPP1 is a critical player in the mechanismsof A /H9252oligomer-mediated toxicity. Although the mechanisms of A /H9252action are not fully understood, our results pro-vide evidence that, in addition to involvingPP1-dependent processes, they also impli-cate CaMKII and IEGs. CaMKII, arg3.1,and zif268 are keymolecules in the mechanisms of LTP andmemory formation (Jones et al., 2001; Lis-man et al., 2002; Tzingounis and Nicoll,2006) and have also been implicated in /H9252-amyloid pathology (Dickey et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2004). The novel correlation thatour results reveal between these moleculesand PP1 suggests that they may be down-stream targets of PP1-dependent pathwaysperturbed by A /H9252oligomers. This of PP1 (Strack et al., 1997)and could account for the alteration inplasticity in our model, which is severe,despite normal expression of NMDA and AMPA receptors and synaptophysin. Interestingly, PP1 inhibi-tionin plasticity toward potentiation (Jouvenceau etal., reverse cognitive deficits in aged mice (Genoux etal., 2002). The present results significantly extend these previousfindings by demonstrating the relevance of these PP1-dependentpathways in the mechanisms of AD. The present findings furtherunderscore the implication of dysfunctional protein phosphory-lation in AD pathology and highlight the importance of proteinphosphatases in this pathology. The importance of their contri-bution is clearly reflected by the fact that the deficits in plasticityassociated with the pathology are fully reversible, just like proteinphosphorylation is. Because PP1 is a major protein phosphatasein neuronal cells, multiple targets and pathways are likely to bemodified, such as phosphorylation or trafficking of glutamatereceptors, as recently shown in primary neurons and organotypicbrain slices from AD mouse models (Snyder et al., 2005; Hsieh etal., 2006). Finally, the severe LTP impairment observed in young arcA /H9252 mice (3 months) when no /H9252-amyloid plaques are detectable sup- ports the hypothesis that oligomeric A /H9252species are major con- tributors to synaptic failure in AD (for review, see Rowan et al.,2003). The rescue of LTP achieved with a single dose of an anti-body directed against the A /H9252sequence confirms this hypothesis and suggests that such antibodies may be useful in immunother-apeutic strategies against AD (Rowan et al., 2005). In our model,the reduced arg3.1 and zif268 expression occurs before any de-tectable extracellular /H9252-amyloid deposition, supporting the evi- Figure 2.
