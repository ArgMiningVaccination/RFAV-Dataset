As we find our 'new normals', how many people will remember what that was like? Even at its height, lockdown's impact on our lives varied greatly , and the differences become more stark as restrictions lift. However in May , our Cure the Care System campaign reminded the wider population what decades of unfairness and underinvestment mean for people affected by dementia. With your help, we'll be keeping social care on the government's agenda until we get the change that's needed. Of course, we're also here to share how we can create change in our own lives and communities today . The best place to see that is in people's real-life experiences, and our magazine is full as ever with the inspiring voices and stories of people living with dementia, their carers, relatives and friends, and supporters who are campaigning and fundraising. Our poetry competition is also still open for entries - until 30 June for poems emailed to us (see p31). Do continue to let us know your comments and ideas about the magazine, and remember you can switch to the email version at alzheimers.org.uk/switch if that would work for you.

It's a great chance for friends and family to come together for loved ones living with dementia and in memory of those we've lost, while raising money for vital dementia services and research. We have 20 walks taking place across England, Wales and Northern Ireland in September and October , all of which will follow government COVID-19 guidelines. Or if you prefer , you can walk your own route on 19 September . Thank you to everyone who took part in their own March Memory Walk - you've raised well over \u00a31.4 million and counting! Register for free at memorywalk.org.uk or call 0300 330 5452.Join us for Memory WalkIn May , Dementia Action Week brought the need for social care reform into sharp focus - we must now ensure that those in power keep their promises and deliver the change that people affected by dementia so desperately need. Thank you to everyone who joined our calls for governments to cure the care system - a system we know should provide quality social care that is free and easy to access, no matter where you live. The recent relaxation of care home visiting restrictions during the pandemic showed what can be achieved when we all make our voices heard, but we must do more to make sure people affected by dementia are prioritised. You can help us keep the pressure on by sharing our social media posts and contacting your elected representatives to tell them your social care story . Visit alzheimers.org.uk/campaigns to help us end the injustice. New rugby research Former world-leading rugby players have joined an Alzheimer's Society-funded dementia prevention study , part of our Sport United Against Dementia (SUAD) campaign. Elite ex-players including Shane Williams and Ben Kay will take part in a new phase of the UK and Ireland PREVENT study , called PREVENT :RFC. This will look at whether elite rugby players show more early warning signs of dementia than the general population and, if so, why . We've also provided funding for an informal pilot study involving football players, including former England international Alan Shearer . Our SUAD campaign is uniting, for the first time, the collective power and reach of sport to improve the lives of current and former players and fans. SUAD will raise vital funds towards research like PREVENT and crucial Society support for people affected by dementia. Senior figures across sport and sports broadcasting have joined the board of SUAD to help generate significant funds and awareness. For more about SUAD visit alzheimers.org.uk/SUAD5 May's Dementia Action Week raised the profile of our broken social care system. As we know from many of you, the system currently makes things worse, not better . It is not helping you stay in control of the challenges dementia throws at you. You tell us about poor and inconsistent standards and quality of care, lack of respite, complicated forms and frightening assessments. The social care system is often hard to access and frequently doesn't provide the support that people affected by dementia need to be able to carry on with safe, independent lives. If nothing else, the coronavirus response across the UK has shown what we can do when we pull together . Now we need to turn that effort into fixing the social care system. T o do that we need political will and public pressure. Alzheimer's Society is leading the charge in asking government why people with dementia still haven't got the affordable, personalised care system they were promised back at the last election. We will keep asking until we get the system you need and deserve. I never fail to be inspired by the team of volunteers and staff at Alzheimer's Society , their determination to make a difference every moment of every day . We know that dementia isn't quitting anytime soon - so neither are we. Kate Lee, Chief Executive Officer @KateLeeCEOWinners at our 2021 Dementia Hero Awards included Paul Harvey , the 80-year-old with Alzheimer's whose piano composition inspired a \u00a31 million donation to support people with dementia. The awards, held during Dementia Action Week and sponsored by Tunstall Healthcare, showcased the stories of people doing outstanding things during the pandemic. Paul was named Dementia Hero for Outstanding Achievement, the award for Care and Compassion went to Morcia Downer for her support of her mum Sandy , and the award for Campaigning to Graeme McGrory .

Is this actually the case? The headlines were based on research at the University of Paris and UCL in London, using data from a survey tracking the sleeping habits of nearly 8,000 people since the 1980s. About half of them also had their sleep tracked by an accelerometer , a device that measures movement. People who slept six hours or less each night at age 50 were said to have a higher risk of developing dementia over the next 25 years. Clare Jonas, Research Communications Officer at Alzheimer's Society , said, 'This research is exciting because it looks at people's sleep habits well before late-onset dementia develops. It provides firmer evidence than before that lack of sleep is a risk factor for dementia rather than an early symptom. 'We still need to be cautious about these findings however , as people answering surveys aren't always aware of what their true sleep patterns are. The accelerometer provides more objective information, but so far the researchers have only been able to use that evidence to assess the risk of dementia over the following six years. We need more research to fully understand what's going on.' Alzheimer's Society helps fund the UK Dementia Research Institute (UK DRI), which is exploring the role of sleep in dementia.

Former nurse France, 71, lives in Newport, south Wales with his wife Helen - also a former nurse - who has been his 'rock'. The couple are grateful for the support they've received from Alzheimer's Society, which has included help with housing and benefits. France, who also has diabetes, bipolar disorder and multiple system atrophy, says that people make incorrect assumptions based on his appearance. From the heart Photographs: Roger Donovan9Reflecting on his long career as a nurse helping unwell and vulnerable people, one moment in particular stands out for France Savarimuthu. 'I was working a night shift supporting a patient with learning disabilities who had slipped in the hospital shower and become paralysed from the neck down. I asked for extra staff to help turn him, but was refused and told there was nothing wrong with him. I felt so sorry for this man,' he says. 'The next morning a director wanted me to change my report, but I refused, because it was the truth. I don't like any injustice.' This attitude remains core to France, who lives with dementia and wants people with the condition to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve. Politics to nursing France lives in Newport, south Wales, but grew up in Mauritius, an island country in the Indian Ocean. He was interested in politics as a teenager , and in his early 20s was elected chairman of his village council, the youngest person in Mauritius to hold such a position. 'The first time I voted, I voted for myself!' says France, who also recalls meeting Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, the first Prime Minister of Mauritius. France enjoyed singing and playing the harmonium, and used to perform at weddings. 'I spoke French and English, but my singing teacher said that I had to learn Hindi, to put the correct feeling into the songs,' he says. 'I learned faster because I had a purpose, and my singing got better .' France worked as a teacher and then a pay clerk before leaving Mauritius for Scotland, age 23, having been offered a job as a nurse at a Glasgow hospital. He went on to medical support roles at Glasgow Airport, British Steel, BP and the Govan shipyard. He later moved to Newport and oversaw a hostel that prepared people with learning disabilities to return to their communities. France, now 71, married fellow nurse Helen in 1983, and they have one son. Diagnosis denial France has a diagnosis of dementia with Parkinsonism. Parkinsonism is a term that covers several conditions, including Parkinson's disease, with similar symptoms such as slow movement, rigidity and problems with walking. 'My writing went first. That was the first sign of Parkinsonism,' says France. 'Then one day I took a walk and my legs were giving way . I had to be in a wheelchair . 'When I got the dementia diagnosis, I didn't want to know about it - I was in denial.' France, who has run four marathons in his life, says he has good and bad days. But he feels his physical state is getting worse overall, including sometimes struggling to walk. Helen notes that his memory sometimes isn't good and that he can be up and down in the night. France can also lack awareness of what's around him when out and about, and he once needed surgery after being knocked down by a car . France has bipolar disorder , diabetes and multiple system atrophy , a rare condition that can affect balance, movement and basic functions such as breathing, digestion and bladder control. He was also in a coma with pneumonia for a week and returned home unable to walk, talk or feed himself. 'I thought I was dying at that time,' says France, who received support from external carers for three years. France currently takes 22 tablets a day and says medication 'brought me back to life'. He's also extremely grateful to Helen, not only for her support with his health conditions, but also for fighting his corner with healthcare professionals. After a life spent supporting others, France Savarimuthu now faces many health challenges of his own. Gareth Bracken speaks to a man with dementia calling for more empathy and understanding. Photographs: Roger Donovan10 'My wife has been a rock to me - I know I can rely on her ,' he says. 'I don't know what I would have done without her .' Not over yet France was only diagnosed with dementia after a psychiatrist assessed him over a few weeks. Previously , some healthcare professionals had doubted he had dementia, because he didn't come across in a certain way in conversation and was able to complete the tasks they set him. France admits that he was able to mask his dementia during some appointments. 'I knew what the medical people were going to ask, so I could hide it,' he says. 'But there's no point doing that, you have to accept it and be treated.' France loves spending time in the garden and says his current quality of life 'isn't too bad', though less exercise during the pandemic has led to him losing strength in his legs. 'We were self-isolating for five or six months - it feels like you're in prison,' he says. 'I followed politics, read my newspapers and listened to music. It was OK but it wasn't normal.' France and Helen found it particularly frustrating to be apart from their young granddaughter , who they recently saw for the first time in nearly a year . 'She's our little darling, lovely she was,' says France. 'It was joy .' France and Helen were also both pleased to have their second COVID vaccination. 'I would advise people to have the vaccine. It's better to have it than not,' says France, who remains cautious. 'Some people are still not wearing masks and don't care, but we're taking care of ourselves and making sure no one else gets it, because it's not over yet,' he says. Kindness and support France and Helen have received valuable support from Alzheimer's Society , including help dealing with a housing association and getting benefits. France also enjoys his weekly 'chat and a laugh' with Barry , a volunteer who met up with him in person before lockdown. 'All I have is praise for Alzheimer's Society - it's coming from my heart,' says France. France and Helen are also involved with Dementia Voice, where people affected by dementia use their personal experiences to help shape what the Society and other organisations do. They have spoken to newly qualified doctors about what it's like to live with dementia and how people with the condition should be treated. 'It's rewarding - I see people taking notes,' says France, who has also given talks to the Welsh Ambulance Service. A few years ago, France and Helen shared their experiences with a group of Members of the Senedd holding an inquiry into hospital care in Wales. This included a story about a nurse who angered France by not supporting him in a person-centred way . However , the couple also underline the positive experiences they've had with healthcare professionals. Exactly the same France hopes that sharing his story will help change people's misconceptions and attitudes about dementia. 'People think about dementia and they think about old people,' he says. 'Some people aren't dementia friendly .' He is also keen to underline the importance of not making assumptions about people. 'Sometimes I go to a shop in my wheelchair and people talk to my wife and ignore me,' he says. 'Or sometimes people see my colour and assume I can't speak English.' For France, it all comes back to empathy and understanding. 'I always used to think, if I was in one of my patient's shoes, how would I feel?' he says. 'People with learning disabilities are human beings with feelings, don't treat them as stupid. It's exactly the same with people with dementia.'

There's very little physical approach with people. You get used to it being the norm, but it's not a very nice norm. I live on my own, though I'm blessed with a close and good family . I love being around people. I would've been visiting my sister and her grandkids - that stopped. Before the pandemic, there wasn't much time to think. Then there was too much time to think. I'm usually a glass half full man, but this last year it's been more glass half empty . I call it feeling sorry for myself, but we're all allowed a bit of that. It's a dangerous way when you get yourself down, so if you've got a contact, talk to them. Spill your heart out - it seems that you can unload your problems and your day becomes so much better . I've done it.Getting there I'm a steering group member for 3NDWG, the 3 Nations Dementia Working Group. I was spending quite a lot of time travelling back and forth to meetings before. I like the 3NDWG meetings, because I feel I'm with friends, and we seem to have achieved something. And you're living the same experiences as others, ups or downs - it doesn't always have to be good news. Alzheimer's Society has been an awful lot of help to me. I used to do the talks, it was exhilarating. I'd talk about dementia to teenagers at schools and universities, they took it in like sponges. They're the people you need to get the message out to. It's organised through James Erskine in the Dementia Voice team - he's very hands on. We met the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in before the pandemic, promoting the cause. Even during the pandemic, we were able to visit Stormont and the MLAs came out and met us. They were breaking their necks to get a photo with us - good PR for them! But there was a sincerity from them that I liked. We're getting there. I've got more campaigning to look forward to, which I relish. Great to wake up I'm diabetic and I was very positive about getting the vaccine. Maybe we've got something to look forward to, if this can all ease off a wee bit. In truth, I'm apprehensive about mixing with people again. But I think things will be very interesting as to what's going to happen. I make the most of life, take what it gives you. I enjoy life to the full. I have the wee dark days, but when I'm on top form, which I am most of the time, it's great to wake up in the morning, Alzheimer's or not. I've been dealt the hand I've been dealt, but if I can do anything to promote what Alzheimer's Society does, I will do it.'I will do it' Michael Keenan in Omagh, aged 61 and living with young-onset Alzheimer's, looks forward to more ups and fewer downs. Michael with (left) Bernadine McCrory, the Society's Country Director for Northern Ireland, and Paula Bradley, MLA for Belfast North.13Walking sense Try something new For Carole Beavis in north Wales, apart from being a fitting way to honour her father , Memory Walk is also about a better tomorrow. My dad, Alan, is 86 and has Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. He was diagnosed in 2011 and lives in a care home now. We used to go for walks together , it was a key part of our relationship. It was a place where we connected. Dad used to be in the merchant navy , and the last place I walked with him was Barmouth Sailors' Institute, which is 10 miles from home in Llandanwg. It made complete sense to walk there for Memory Walk. In my corner Alzheimer's Society has been a lifeline for me, it's constantly been in my corner . The helpline gave emotional and practical support, and I connected with other people through T alking Point. Even when things were very hard and horrible, fundraising made me look forwards. For me, you're very much rooted in the day to day - crisis points - but I'm contributing to better things in the future. It's been an awful year , with dementia and deaths in the family . There's been very little to hang on to. It's been important for me to know I'm doing something useful and practical. Different for others The walk was lovely . I was wearing a Memory Walk T-shirt and the name of who I was walking for . People smiled and nodded and acknowledged me. I was thinking about loads of stuff to do with Dad. At the end, it was really emotional to think that he won't ever come here again. But it was also almost accepting that this is where we are - we have to make it as good as possible for our children and grandchildren. And a lovely thing happened. Some friends pulled up in the car and handed me some pink gin and tonic, and chocolate! At the end, my husband met me and we sat looking at the sea. I raised over \u00a31,500 - I was astounded by the support. I did it because I want things to be different for other people. My dad was so frightened about having dementia. He wouldn't tell anyone or engage with services. His life could have been so much better if he didn't feel so ashamed. I hope that other people will feel less bad about getting help.

There have been lots of challenges, but by far the hardest has been keeping my parents' day-to-day spending under control and secure. T o help solve this, with support from Alzheimer's Society , we've launched Sibstar - a debit card and app that other people affected by dementia and facing the same challenge as us can soon benefit from as well. Unsustainable spending As Mum's condition progressed, she started spending more on groceries than I did, and I've got a family of four! She made countless cashpoint withdrawals, writing cheques to charities and taking out duplicate insurance policies on the washing machine. She was really vulnerable to phone and doorstep salespeople. And then she started giving away cash to homeless people. My mum is a kind-hearted, generous lady , but there was no way she could sustain this level of spending and giving. We tried everything to protect Mum's everyday spending while keeping her independence. We asked the bank to set withdrawal and spend limits on her card. We scratched out the code on the back of her card, but she'd lose it and the bank would send her a new one. T aking away her cheque book and going cash only was a complete disaster . This all resulted in us having to take away her access to her own money , which immediately led to a decline in her condition. We needed a way to keep Mum financially independent but financially secure as well, and that's where the idea for Sibstar came from. Secure card Sibstar is a highly secure debit card and app for people with dementia and their families. The person with dementia has the Sibstar card, which acts like any other debit card. The person supporting them has the Sibstar app on their phone, and together they decide how and where the card can be used. You can set daily spending limits, switch cashpoint or online payments on or off, and freeze and unfreeze the card. You can also receive spend notifications. This can all be changed at any time, so you can adapt how you use Sibstar as the person's dementia changes. We aim to provide people who have dementia with a way to remain financially independent whilst keeping their money safe and secure. Alzheimer's Society's investment in Sibstar , through its Accelerator Programme, has been invaluable. It's enabling us to get it to market more quickly . The card has a monthly subscription fee of \u00a34.99, and people can register now to be one of the first to try it out.

Memory - Finding out our IVF treatment to have our children had 'worked'. Why dementia research? Since my PhD I've worked in cancer research, but this has come to include people with dementia. One in two people will develop cancer in their lifetime, mostly when they're older , and many cancers are now curable or treatable as a long-term condition. As a result, many people who now develop and live with cancer already have dementia. Compared to other cancer patients, people with dementia are more likely to have their cancer diagnosed at a later stage, or not at all. They also tend to receive less cancer treatment, suffer more treatment complications and have their cancer pain less well managed. How has Alzheimer's Society supported your work? We've found that people who support relatives or friends with both dementia and cancer find it emotionally and practically difficult to manage the two conditions. There's a lack of information and peer support tailored to their specific situation - dealing with cancer alongside dementia. Based on this, we worked with Alzheimer's Society to establish a cancer-specific area of T alking Point, the Society's online community . In this area, people with dementia and their carers can ask and reply to questions about dealing with cancer when someone also has dementia. They can take part in live Q&A sessions with specialist health care professionals, and they can read Q&As that have already taken place. For example, one was with the UK's only dementia nurse employed in a cancer centre, who supports people with dementia and their families through making decisions about and undergoing cancer treatment. You can find the 'Caring for a person with dementia and cancer' area in the 'I care for a person with dementia' forum of T alking Point - visit alzheimers.org.uk/talkingpointWhat are you currently working on? We have just finished a study looking at ways that hospital cancer departments can improve care for people with dementia. We now want to work with managers and clinicians to see how ideas from our research could be implemented in practice. In what direction would you like to take your research in future? Our work has focused on hospital-based cancer care, but we know many people with dementia do not receive anti-cancer treatments. We would like to extend our work to consider how GPs can support people affected by dementia to make decisions about cancer treatments and manage cancer symptoms.Meet the researcher: Laura Ashley Reader in Health Psychology at Leeds Beckett University.

I fall asleep to the radio set on a timer so it switches off after 45 minutes. Either Classic FM or local radio. If I don't sleep well at night I tend to nap during the day , and this leads to a bad practice which is difficult to break. If I'm awake in the early hours I feel more isolated, the only one in the world who is awake. I know this is not true but it does have that effect. I feel much happier psychologically if I get an undisturbed night's sleep even if it's only six hours, and do feel more energetic during the day . dbrilyant on T alking Point, 75 with Alzheimer's in Somerset I am five years from diagnosis and am sleeping ever more in the day . Coping with life takes longer and is much more tiring than it used to be. I try to sleep, eat and go to the loo by the clock. I am very physically active, so get sleepy . If I wake before 3.30am I take melatonin and if I wake after that time I take a very mild sedative to give me a little extra sleep. I avoid getting over-tired. By lunchtime I am ready to drop so I go to bed and set an alarm for an hour . This enables me to cope with the rest of the day . When I switch out the light, I try to remember (and thank God for) three good things that have happened in the day , then I count my breaths until I fall asleep. Ray Dernie, 79 in Nottinghamshire I go to bed at approximately the same time each day and have six to eight hours sleep. I have always done this, no special arrangements. I live alone and have a comfortable bed. Chyanne Hooks, 24 in Essex I have set bedtime and wake-up times, with a wind-down/ wake-up routine. I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome when I was 17. More recently , my diagnosis was changed to coeliac diseases, with an underactive thyroid. I sometimes have to take a nap during the day for 45-90 mins. I alternate between active days and rest days. I know if I don't stick to my routines, my energy levels will suffer . I am a lot more aware of the way I feel and have learnt to accept that I need to rest more than others in order to be able to function. Jo Cooling, 52 in Wiltshire I stop eating at least two hours before going to bed, preferably more. I've cut out almost all alcohol, only have about one drink a week, and no caffeine at all. Less high- sugar foods and certainly not after mid-afternoon. I sleep with socks on and take HRT . I was sleeping less well as I got older and understanding more how important sleep is to your health. Sleeping well means I'm more alert and generally feeling good. Some things, like age and genes, affect your chance of developing dementia but you can't change them. Things you could do include keeping your mind and body active, enjoying healthier food, not smoking, drinking less alcohol, staying in touch with people, and dealing with any health problems. If you already have dementia, the same things can help you to stay well. Visit www.nhs.uk/livewell for wellness advice for everyone. How I enjoy better sleep We ask people about how they keep active and well, whether they have dementia or not. This issue, we hear about improving rest and sleep. 17What's changed most since your diagnosis? The biggest thing that's changed is me. I now have a more positive outlook on life. And because I'm positive about things, I love to share things with others to show people that we can still do things when we have dementia. We can still learn new skills. It's a whole new chapter - I call it my dementia chapter . What would you take to your desert island? I did think at first my mobile phone, if it worked off solar power , because there's all sorts on it - photos, poems, lots of memories on there. If not an electrical item, I'd take my watercolours. It's something I've picked up over lockdown, I'd never done it before. I could then paint the scenery around me, the flowers and the plants, and that would be my memory of being on a desert island. What song or tune sums up your life so far? Fight song by Rachel Platten, because it's a very positive sort of a song. Throughout the song, she's fighting for things all the time and wanting to achieve and wanting to get there. I've always been one that's had to fight to keep going - more so now! What single thing improves your quality of life? This has got to be my dog T oby , who is my four-legged pal. He's always at the side of me when I'm not feeling well, and he also keeps me very active because he gets me out every day and walking in the fresh air , which is good for my mental wellbeing as well. If you could go back in time, where would you go? My wedding day . Everyone that was at my wedding meant a lot to me, it was everybody that we loved and wanted there because it was only a small wedding. We've lost people now that was there, so it would be nice to go back and spend some time with them again. What is your most treasured possession? If you'd have asked me this about 10 years ago, I would have said my car . But now, my whole perspective on things has changed and the most important thing for me is my camera. Every single day I'm creating new memories. I've been out this morning for an hour and a half, just sitting and snapping the birds flying past. I might forget next week where I was, but I can look back at the photos and I've got the wonderful memories.Read Gail's blog at www.dementiaalzheimers.home.blog and hear her diary entries at www.dementiadiaries.org If you have dementia and would like to answer our questions for a future column, email magazine@alzheimers.org.uk Q&A: Gail Gregory Gail Gregory in Lancashire, aged 56 with young-onset Alzheimer's disease.18 We are here for you Phone support Our dementia advisers are available on the phone seven days a week, providing information, advice and emotional support to anyone affected by dementia.

Person living with dementia alzheimers.org.uk/getsupport19Gradually, restrictions are easing and we are looking forward to getting out more and meeting our supporters again. It's been a difficult year for everyone, and community fundraising is no exception. I'd been in post for one fun and successful year before the pandemic - the North East was buzzing with fundraising for Alzheimer's Society! We have four active voluntary fundraising groups and I'd built strong relationships with local businesses, with good leads for potential new partnerships. Events and campaigns like the Great North Run, Memory Walk, Cupcake Day and Elf Day galvanised our region and really brought everyone together . Then COVID hit and it all stopped overnight. Community groups could not host their annual ball or ladies' night, businesses were empty and the energies that drive Charity of the Year partnerships had to be used elsewhere. We immediately began promoting our emergency appeal to all our partners and throughout our networks. As colleagues went on furlough, I was thanking and keeping in touch with more supporters than I normally would. I started making an extra 50 calls a week to people involved in events like Cupcake Day . Even now, I'm speaking to supporters I'd never have had contact with before - people taking on treks or asking about leaving a gift in their will. I have had to adapt to working from home permanently and all that brings, including just not moving enough and making sure I go for walks to avoid back pain and Zoom fatigue. I've had personal challenges, as everyone will have in one way or another . My two-year old daughter spent months at home with myself and my wife (who also has a very demanding full-time job) and became a regular feature on team meetings, including screaming for attention in the background! But there are positives too. I have always felt very well supported by my colleagues and seeing each other in our homes has really bonded us together . As our team has evolved, we've integrated what we do with Dementia Friends and dementia-friendly communities to form a new fundraising powerhouse - the Regional Engagement team. The future's looking brighter and I'm super proud to have lived through this remarkable period of history with Alzheimer's Society .

Declan Boyle, an accredited green badge tour guide in Newtownabbey , is offering two- and-a-half hour walks from Whiteabbey village to the nearby fortified 16th century White House, which he says feature 'tainted wealth, a flighty lady , \"Dick Whittington\" and a Hollywood film star amongst many others'. 'I want to use my skills as a tour guide to help make a difference,' Declan told local press. 'It's great to think that I will be raising funds to help support people living with dementia now and to fund research to one day find a cure for dementia.' Covering around 3.5 miles, the tours are carried out in accordance with social distancing guidelines, enabled by a wireless audio system. Jenay McCartan, Community Fundraiser , said, 'People affected by dementia need us now more than ever , but the pandemic has hit us hard financially , despite an unprecedented demand for our services. 'We're in awe of supporters like Declan whose dedication to fundraising for Alzheimer's Society ensures we're able to support those who need it most during this difficult period.'

Diolch yn fawr!'Forever in blue jeans A fundraiser in West Yorkshire has teamed up with a local singer for this year's Denim for Dementia campaign, encouraging workplaces, schools and care home staff to dress in denim to add to the thousands she's already raised for Alzheimer's Society . Faye Mitchell in Pudsey , who raised over \u00a350,000 in the previous two years, was joined by Clare Brooke singing Neil Diamond's 1979 hit Forever in Blue Jeans for a heart- warming video to promote the 2021 event (search 'Denim for Dementia' on YouTube). 'We've tried to add a bit of humour to the video,' said Faye, 'but also include information and images that show how big an issue dementia is. 'The idea behind the campaign is simple - we're asking people to wear denim and make a donation to Alzheimer's Society .' After her mother Carol's diagnosis with Alzheimer's aged only 64, Faye said she began fundraising for the Society as a way to turn her 'anger into positivity'.

My father and mother both lived and died with dementia, and I saw first hand the deep, profound and lasting impact it had on them, on me and on our family . I couldn't not get involved in order to help change that situation for others. How to fill an unexpected day off? After over a year of lockdown and shielding, I'll let my imagination go far and wide. The day would start with my partner in Cornwall, followed by a trip around the UK on bikes, trains, canal boats and our own two feet. We'd take in majestic landscapes, delicious food and copious amounts of art and music, with enough conversation to build memories for years to come. No pictures would be needed. We'd end the day in a luxurious treehouse in the Highlands. Then, as if by magic, we'd be back in our own house the next morning, reinvigorated and ready for anything. Proudest achievement? Personally , my civil partnership and our 28-year relationship. Professionally , my BA and Honorary Fellowship from Birkbeck, my Honorary Doctorate from University of the Arts, and an OBE from the Queen. Worst advice you've been given? Over my career , I moved from the City to the arts, visual arts to theatre, heritage to design, large scale to small. Each time, without fail, someone advised me thatthis was a terrible, wrong or crazy move. Whilst this always made me quail, it also made me think that sometimes people give that advice because they wouldn't want to do it. So I kept calm and carried on, worked with brilliant teams and together we created some interesting footprints to leave behind. Biggest priority for coming months? Ensuring that, as the world learns to live with COVID-19, the Society's new strategy meaningfully impacts the lives of people affected by dementia, in ways that work for them. Most important thing learned from a person with dementia? Patience. This probably wasn't a strength of mine, but after spending a decade with my father and then my mother living with dementia, I found and tried to develop it. It is a skill which has helped me in making Companion Calls over the last year , as well as my day-to-day life. Most looking forward to? A new pair of lungs - I'm on the waiting list for a transplant. Not having to shield, sanitise everything and put all items into quarantine before opening them. Watching the government actually act on its pledge to prioritise and fund social care.Sarah Weir , Trustee Spotlight: Sarah (left) with her partner Louise.22 Quick read As pandemic restrictions are eased, Jamie Greaves can't wait for care home visits to return to normal. Jamie is delighted that he can again visit his mum Patricia, who has dementia, though the number of visits is still limited. When normal visits were stopped because of the pandemic, attempts at video calls, window visits and pod visits were all unsuccessful. Patricia was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia and bipolar disorder in December 2018 after personality and behaviour changes.23I was in full PPE and met by someone in a hazmat suit - it was like a science fiction film,' says Jamie Greaves, recalling his first 'window visit' to his mum's care home during the pandemic. 'She recognised me but became hysterical and wanted to climb out, so had to be restrained by staff. It was actually quite horrendous.' Like so many carers, friends and relatives, Jamie has found it incredibly upsetting to be denied proper visits to a loved one with dementia. 'My mum is my world, she brings a great deal of joy to my life,' he says. 'I felt so guilty to suddenly stop visiting.' With visits still restricted, Jamie continues to call for change. 'I want it to go back to an open- door policy . Care home residents aren't prisoners,' he says. Starring role Jamie's mum Patricia, now 73, spent much of her working life as a secretary or PA for managing directors of large companies. She later moved into bookkeeping and her own CV-writing business. She was also involved with local singing and drama groups. 'She was always taking the starring role!' says Jamie, a freelance creative consultant who lives in Brighton. 'She was very lively , social and active.' Jamie is an only child who was born after Patricia had already experienced a series of miscarriages, and the pair have always been close. 'There wouldn't be a day without some sort of contact,' he says. Sketchy diagnosis Patricia always loved the sunshine and around 10 years ago moved to T enerife with her partner . Some years later , it started to become clear that something wasn't right with her health. 'She would repeat herself in emails, or phone me twice in three minutes, not realising we'd already spoken,' says Jamie. 'Her friends said she came back from a restaurant and got plates out to start cooking a meal.' After what Jamie describes as a 'sketchy' diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in T enerife, Patricia and her partner moved back to the UK to live in Stoke-on- Trent, to get a proper diagnosis and further support. But having struggled to come to terms with how dementia was affecting Patricia's behaviour , her partner walked out. 'It was devastating for Mum - she just kept asking where he was,' says Jamie. Completely hysterical Jamie got social services involved, who said that Patricia needed to go to a dementia assessment unit. 'That was one of the hardest things I've ever done,' says Jamie. 'I was told to get Mum chatting to staff and then edge out through a side door . It was very upsetting, although also a relief to get her properly assessed.' A later visit from Jamie proved distressing for both of them. 'Mum freaked out and was completely hysterical,' he says. 'She was kicking out at staff and screaming at me that I'd put her there and didn't love her . I broke down in tears, which was when she snapped out of it and calmed down.' Missing freedom 'After a year's separation from his mum, the return of face-to-face care home visits means the world to Jamie Greaves. Gareth Bracken speaks to a son cherishing every moment shared. 2324 Patricia was 'sectioned' - detained under the Mental Health Act. She spent 10 weeks on a hospital psychiatric ward, where she was diagnosed in December 2018 with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and bipolar disorder . FTD is a less common type of dementia that can cause changes to a person's personality and behaviour , and difficulties with language. Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition that can cause someone's mood to swing from one extreme to the other . Caged lion Patricia went to live in a specialist nursing home in Stoke for people with dementia, with Jamie visiting every weekend from Brighton. However , Patricia would become very upset when he wasn't around, so in mid-2019 Jamie moved her to a home near him. 'I was there most days and would take her out on the seafront or to the shops or pub,' he says. 'I would do her nails and hair - she loved that. There were still some separation issues but overall it worked really well.' Then came the pandemic, and Jamie was no longer allowed to be with his mum. 'I was devastated,' he says. 'She couldn't understand about the pandemic or that I wasn't allowed to visit, so it was a horrendous time and very upsetting. 'I lost many nights' sleep thinking about it, and as it went on the frustration built and built.' Patricia found video calls confusing and window visits distressing, while pod visits were also unsuccessful. 'She was behind a pane of glass but wouldn't settle,' says Jamie. 'She was like a caged lion, trying to find a way out to be where I was.' Although Jamie found the home's manager to be understanding, in his opinion, care home companies have tended to be overly cautious. 'I think that people's deterioration during lockdown has been worse than the risk of COVID in some respects,' he says. Jamie helped to raise awareness of the importance of proper visits on social media, writing to his MP and also sharing his experiences in support of an Alzheimer's Society campaign. 'I think there was a period where the government weren't fully understanding the magnitude of the situation,' he says. Future risk Jamie's grandmother also had dementia, and that prompted him to try a self-testing DNA kit. The Society doesn't recommend these kits, because they aren't as reliable as tests done by the NHS and it can be easy to misunderstand what the results mean without personalised advice from a professional. However , Jamie's test said he had a slightly increased chance of developing Alzheimer's and he adds, 'It does make me think about the future.' Being a single gay man with no children or siblings has an impact on what this would mean too. 'I don't see much visibility of support for LGBTQ people with dementia or their family members and partners. It would be nice to see care homes catering specifically for this demographic, especially as gay people may be more likely to be left without a partner or family to care for them.' Cherished moments Jamie can now visit his mum once a week if he takes a COVID test beforehand and wears PPE. 'It's still not ideal, but it's noticeably better ,' he says. 'It seems odd to say , but after the year we've had, even being able to visit for 30 minutes meant the world. Seeing her face light up is worth a million dollars to me.' Patricia has had both doses of the COVID vaccine and Jamie is now waiting for the frequency and flexibility of pre-pandemic visits to return. 'I miss that freedom of longer visits. Mum gets quite sleepy now and sometimes struggles to talk, so when she's animated and chatty I want to make the most of it,' he says. And as Jamie reflects on a 'horrendous' year , the importance and value of his visits are as great as ever . 'You've got to cherish moments with the people that you love, because you don't know how dramatically things can change from one moment to the next.'\" \"She couldn't understand about the pandemic or that I wasn't allowed to visit, so it was a horrendous time and very upsetting.25 What can you do to help?

As coronavirus hit, studies came to a standstill as labs were forced to close and face-to-face interviews became impossible. There was also much financial uncertainty, with Alzheimer's Society forced to pause funding for new research during 2020, leaving pioneering projects and talented researchers hanging in the balance. But as we hopefully emerge from the pandemic, the Society is excited to launch projects previously put on hold, with \u00a32 million in funding. This includes \u00a3800,000 to studies led by early career researchers. These are researchers who are at the beginning of their careers but already starting to specialise and become experts in their area. Researchers start off with a PhD studentship before moving to postdoctoral research projects and fellowships. Each project requires funding for the tools and equipment they need to carry out their research. However , the uncertainty of the last year has raised concerns that promising researchers are being forced to move to other , better funded areas of research. 'Early career researchers bring bright ideas and new perspectives. But they've been the most vulnerable to being lost to the field as a direct result of the crisis, as many funding opportunities have been withdrawn,' says Julia Ravey , Research Communications Officer at the Society . 'Our Early Careers Researchers Fund will secure the future of these talented researchers as they tackle some of the biggest questions about dementia at leading universities across the UK.' Shaping support This early career investment is making a varied range of vital research possible. Among the projects to be funded are those aiming to understand the effects of a type 2 diabetes drug on dementia, how certain genes affect dementia, and how to increase GPs' confidence in having conversations about end of life care. The Society has announced significant funding for some of the most talented dementia researchers around. Gareth Bracken explains how investment today could mean a breakthrough tomorrow. Quick read After an uncertain year for dementia research, the Society is investing \u00a3800,000 in projects led by early career researchers. Funded research includes studies into drug treatments, genetics and end of life planning. If they can't secure funding at the right points of their careers, dementia researchers sometimes have to consider moving to another field. Our investment in talented researchers, which may lead to future breakthroughs, is enabled by the generous donations of our supporters. Bright ideas What can you do to help?

Previous Society funding enabled the Deaf with Dementia Project to develop a dementia assessment in British Sign Language (BSL), understand more about Deaf people's knowledge of dementia, and share the stories of Deaf people with dementia and their families. The findings featured in Emma's PhD, which was the first of its kind worldwide. Emma's latest study is gathering the opinions of Deaf carers about how to shape culturally appropriate support services for people with dementia and their Deaf carers. 'There is a widespread lack of access to primary healthcare services for Deaf carers in their first language of BSL, so Deaf people's experiences of supporting a person with dementia aren't often represented,' says Emma, herself a Deaf BSL user . 'I am in an ideal position to increase awareness and visibility of this minority culturo-linguistic group and empower its citizens.' Emma says that our support has enabled her to become an internationally recognised Deaf researcher , and that such funding for early career researchers must be maintained. 'There is still so much to do to ensure that people with dementia are respected and included as first-class citizens in today's world,' she says. Stepping stone Previous early career researchers have made important and impressive advancements with Society funding. These include showing how technology can speed up drug design and developing a smartphone app that can spot the very early signs of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Ryan West is a researcher who specialises in FTD and last year published exciting early-stage research into a liver drug that may be able to protect brain cells from the damaging effects of this type of dementia. 'From day one of my PhD to now, I've either had funding from or have been affiliated with Alzheimer's Society ,' he says. 'Being awarded my Alzheimer's Society fellowship represented a real stepping stone between being a post-doctoral researcher and starting to set up my own, fully independent research lab.' Defeat dementia We can't afford to lose any more researchers who might hold the key to the dementia breakthroughs of tomorrow. That's why we are incredibly grateful to everyone who has donated to the Society and enabled us to resume our funding. 'Without your generous support these projects would be unable to go ahead,' says Julia. 'We can now continue to invest in the first step of a researcher's career , which could span decades and lead to life-changing discoveries which help us defeat dementia in years to come.'

Many people have missed out on the sort of contact and interaction that can be a lifeline. Alex Winstanley is striving to tackle this using a book that he's written, inspired by the experiences of his grandma Mary , who had mixed dementia. My Grandma has Dementia, aimed at ages four to10, explores and explains what life can be like for someone living with the condition and their family . The book also aims to give children an understanding of how they can help to support people with dementia. 'I had a special bond with my grandma and grew up recognising the changes in her that dementia brought, and seeing my mum provide daily care for her often worried me,' says Alex. 'I want to teach children about dementia and reduce any anxiety they might have about family members living with dementia or moving into a care home.' There'll be five more books on other health conditions, including depression and cancer , all inspired by people with lived experience. 'I want to help children develop a positive, person-centred approach to life,' says Alex. Positive relationships Alex runs Happy Smiles Training, a social enterprise that delivers disability awareness and social inclusion training to schools, community groups and businesses across the north-west of England.A reading project involving schools is tackling isolation for care home residents while raising awareness of dementia. Gareth Bracken finds out how it was all inspired by one woman's story. Quick read A reading project involving primary schools and care homes is helping to tackle social isolation among residents. The project uses a book written by Alex Winstanley that was inspired by his grandma Mary, who had mixed dementia. Kath Purnell at Windsor House care home in Wigan says the residents get a lot from interacting with a different generation. One of the school pupils says that learning more about dementia will help them to support their grandad. My Grandma has Dementia, by Alex Winstanley (2021), 34 pages, \u00a37.99, ISBN 9798582240631. 29 'When the pandemic hit and we were unable to continue our work face to face, I wanted to find another way of having a positive impact on children and young people, and this book was the answer!' he says. With funding from Greater Manchester Centre for Voluntary Organisation, Happy Smiles Training runs an online reading project involving primary schools and care homes across Wigan and Leigh. Through this, a team of inclusion champions - young adults with disabilities - from Happy Smiles Training read the book with school children, play educational games about dementia, and discuss the impact that dementia can have on a person and their family . The children are then supported to read the book to care home residents, including those living with dementia. Every stage of the project takes place online via video call. 'We hope that we are addressing the social isolation of care home residents during the pandemic, as well as supporting the reading and speaking skills of pupils, which may also have been negatively impacted by COVID,' says Alex. 'We want to create positive, sustainable relationships between the pupils and residents.' Social contact The project is proving popular with all involved, including Sandra Speight, a teacher a St Cuthbert's Catholic Primary School in Wigan. 'The class absolutely loved it and it was a really positive experience for them,' she says. 'We'd like to purchase some of the books for our school library .' A pupil at the school added, 'I really enjoyed learning about dementia because my granddad has dementia and I think knowing more about dementia will help me to help my granddad.' Kath Purnell, who works at Windsor House care home in Wigan, where Alex's grandma received excellent care, was full of praise for the book and reading session. 'It was an easy book for children through to residents to understand dementia,' she says. 'It explained it really well and it was made enjoyable for everyone involved. 'It's so important for our residents to have as much social contact as possible, and they got a lot out of interacting with a different generation. They loved reading the colourful and engaging book together with the pupils!' Care home residents with dementia were also pleased. 'I really liked the illustrations, they were great,' says one. Another adds, 'I think it will really help young ones to understand dementia.' Extremely personal The project recently began running face-to-face sessions including during Dementia Action Week from 17-23 May . Also held during that week were the Dementia Hero Awards, where Alex won the Dementia Voice award. Mary died just before Christmas last year , and Alex sees the book and reading project as her legacy in the fight against dementia. 'I never thought that the book would be read by hundreds of families around the world, and it makes my day when people get in touch to tell me how much they've enjoyed it or how much it means to them,' he says. 'This work is extremely personal to me and I am very proud that it continues to positively impact the lives of children, young people and the families of people living with dementia.'

Dementia is the UK's biggest killer . Someone develops it every three minutes and there's currently no cure. But, people can still live well with dementia and Alzheimer's Society provides support for those living with dementia, family , carers as well as funding vital research. If anyone would like to get a copy of the journal, please contact bigdibber@outlook.com to make arrangement for payment and delivery (the cost is \u00a33 plus 70p postage).

Letter of the month A series of online videos aims to reassure people with dementia in Wales who are anxious about getting out and about and dealing with COVID-19 restrictions. Get There T ogether films feature shops, libraries, caf\u00e9s, healthcare services and other community settings. They show examples of signs people might expect to see, one-way systems, social distancing markings, signs and clear screens, which could be confusing when first encountered. The short, friendly videos have been developed in partnership between NHS Wales, local authorities and a range of businesses and partners. Since the films were supplied at various stages of the pandemic, anyone accessing the resources is advised to check current government guidelines for up-to-date advice where you live.

If you can't email them, we can include poems received by 16 June posted to: Poetry Competition, Alzheimer's Society , 43-44 Crutched Friars, London EC3N 2AE. The competition is open to residents of the UK, Republic of Ireland, Isle of Man and Channel Islands, aged 16 or above at time of entering. Poems must be your original work and not published elsewhere (unless in a personal capacity , eg on your blog - ask us if you're unsure). Poems will be anonymised while being shortlisted and the winners selected, and the results are final. 32We returned to our West Sussex consumer panel to find out what they thought of a range of everyday gadgets from Ravencourt. Panel members tested kitchen aids called 'pan pickles', two types of talking thermometer and a prototype DAB radio and music player . We caught up with them over Zoom to get their feedback. Pan pickles Pan pickles were created to position pans on an induction hob, but they can also be used to keep bowls in place on any other surface that isn't heated directly . Made from silicone, they come in bright yellow as well as black. Having got through some fiddly shrink-wrap to try them out, Joan said, 'They're very quirky in appearance, we call them bananas! 'Once you know what they're for , you don't really need instructions. You can just figure that out, they're really easy to use.' Stan said, 'I'll use them because I've got a tremor and I can't hold saucepans or basins properly . I put them around the edge, around the base, and it holds them firm - it works. 'And when they're at rest and they're stored away , I have them as a smile on the cupboard door!' Although Ian didn't think he'd need to use them a lot, he said, 'For the right person at the right time, they'd be jolly good.' Seeing them for the first time over Zoom, Roger said, 'They would be useful on an induction hob, especially if you can't see very well.' T alking thermometers The Ear and Forehead T alking Thermometer takes a person's temperature if you put it against their forehead or in their ear . It can store the last 30 readings in its memory . Paul and Penny said using it was straightforward. 'It's really nice to use, it's small, it's light in weight,' said Penny . 'Paul liked the fact that it spoke to him, saying his temperature rather Consumer panel People affected by dementia try out products that aim to solve everyday problems around the home. Helpful gadgets 33than having to try and read it. I'd definitely buy one like that, I think it's quite a fair price.' The Non-contact T alking Thermometer measures body , room or surface temperature - you just point it and press a button. It speaks the result as well as displaying it. Stan and Joan found this simple to use, though they didn't immediately realise that you need to leave it 10 minutes after turning it on to calibrate. Joan said they probably wouldn't buy it themselves. 'It's bit old-fashioned, but there are other ways to take temperature that are less costly .' Joyce and John thought it was good value for money , and John liked that it was contactless. 'It's comfortable to use,' said Joyce. 'I love the fact you can check the temperature of a room. It does what it says on the box.'Easy Music Player Panel members tried a prototype Easy Music Player that Ravencourt has been developing in partnership with the Society . It aims to make playing DAB radio, music and audio books easier since, once it's set up with someone's preferences, they only need to use one button to turn it on and off. Joan and Stan found the radio easy to use once they'd got to grips with setting it up. 'We were a bit confused by the instructions at first,' said Joan, 'but we managed to set up stations and it was playing and everything. We did wonder what the USB port was for .' Oli from Ravencourt explained that you can play your own playlist from a USB stick. If you use this to listen to audio books, it will bookmark them so you can have more than one on the go without losing your place. It also plays from Bluetooth devices. Joan said, 'I did think it was a bit expensive, but now I know what else it can do, it probably is good value for money!' Although John and Joyce also found setting it up a challenge at first, especially connecting to Bluetooth, they enjoyed using it. Joyce, ' John thought it was very robust, he liked the design. I like the idea of the data stick, if John had his favourite playlist. That would be further down the road for him.' John agreed, 'Yes, it will be good for simplicity - that's my music on the stick, I put that in the radio and it works. ' Joyce played a tune that my dad used to like, he used to sing it - ''China doll'' - and the sound was perfect!' Oli said Ravencourt have now improved radio reception and how some of the controls work on this product.

Caroline Branney , who manages our Dementia Knowledge Centre, says, ' June and T ony , the authors of Four Umbrellas, provide an absorbing account of their lives and how dementia crept up on them, how it reshaped day-to-day activities, their relationships and their happiness. 'Originally , they had decided to write a book together to highlight the issue of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but it evolved into a memoir about Alzheimer's.' Rosemary Cassidy , a reader in County Down, says, 'I'm only starting out on my journey with dementia with my 90-year old mother , who has not been diagnosed yet. The signs are evident though. 'Our book could be entitled \"The five sheets,\" as that was how many were on my mother's bed last week! In the first visit to the doctor in a year and a half, she responded, \"Yes,\" to the doctor who was asking could she make her own bed. 'The doctor replied that anyone at the age of 90 making a double bed was in great shape. They didn't check what size the bed is - it is single, which we just had changed because she struggled with the weight and size of the bigger bed and its covers. My mother didn't acknowledge it was a single bed nor had any idea how many sheets were on it.' In the book, it's the four umbrellas that T ony packs into one suitcase that symbolise how his thinking has been affected, years before his diagnosis. Stigma and signs T ony and June describe the stigma that still exists about dementia, making so many of us reluctant to acknowledge it until it's inescapable. 'For a long time, T ony and his wife June preferred to talk about MCI and his depression, and were in denial about some of the signs that his condition was worsening,' says Caroline. 'This was also because the doctors seemed unwilling to diagnose someone at such a young age. Initially the couple preferred secrecy , but increasingly June became frustrated and describes living \"a half-life, in which the disease, with no written or formal diagnosis, kept us financially troubled and emotionally stifled\".' Rosemary says, 'T ony's examples of early signs are also to be highlighted, especially for carers who are often only learning the hard way .' 'For example,' says Caroline, ' June describes T ony's manic and angry behaviour while driving on holiday in Spain, which was completely out of character . On their return to Canada, T ony had lost all his enthusiasm for their house and garden. They decided to move to an apartment shortly afterwards.' Much to learn 'Despite the memory and cognitive challenge, I am also amazed how much T ony was able to contribute to the book.' says Rosemary . 'It would be good to hear more from him. It seems his acceptance of his condition counted for a lot as regards his peace of mind - much to be learnt there by professionals.' Caroline agrees, 'Most moving are some of T ony's own words to describe his experience. For example, \"It doesn't mean it's the end of your life. Actually , it's the beginning of a new one... it took me a while to discover this, but it's been humbling.\"' Four Umbrellas: A couple's journey into young-onset Alzheimer's, by June Hutton and T Wanless (Dundurn 2020), 224 pages, \u00a314.99, ISBN 9781459747791.Four read a moving 'insider's account' of young-onset dementia by a writing couple in Canada. 35Find the following podcasts on Google Podcasts, Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Pocket Casts, Stitcher and other apps, or listen to them on each podcast's website.

In England, a national framework says that a person's 'representative' should have the information they need to take part. This could be a friend, family member , someone the person's appointed as attorney or deputy , or an organisation representing them. CHC is a package of care arranged and fully funded by the NHS. A person might be eligible if most of their care is to manage health needs, rather than social care needs such as help with washing, dressing and independence. An assessment for CHC funding looks at how intense, unpredictable and complex someone's needs are. There are variations in how funding operates in different parts of the UK. People in Wales could expect similar processes to England, while CHC processes in Northern Ireland are currently undergoing reform. What should happen? In England, the first step is usually the completion of a checklist by a health or social care professional to see whether someone should be offered a full assessment. The person and their representative should have the opportunity to be present while the checklist is done. They should also be told in writing as soon as possible whether a full assessment will be done, and the reasons why . If there's an assessment, the person and their representative should play a central role in it. Their view of the person's needs, including any supporting evidence, should be properly considered alongside professional views. If the person can't contribute themselves, it's even more important that they have a representative doing this on their behalf.What could I do? As you weren't involved in the assessment, you can challenge the decision not to award your partner CHC funding on the basis that the correct processes weren't followed. You could also appeal if you had been involved but felt the decision wasn't right. The first stage of your appeal would be a local resolution process, and how this is done will vary . If this doesn't change the decision, the second stage would be an independent review panel convened by NHS England. You should expect to have input into this too.NHS funding decision In England, a social enterprise called Beacon can provide up to 90 minutes of free advice on CHC issues, and you can also download their helpful toolkit - visit www.beaconchc.co.uk or call 0345 548 0300. In Wales, Age Cymru could provide advice - see www.agecymru.org.uk or call 0300 303 4498. In Northern Ireland, the Law Centre NI may be able to advise - see www.lawcentreni.org or call 028 9024 4401.Ask an expert 'My partner has dementia and lives in a care home in Devon. I've been told he was turned down for NHS Continuing Healthcare funding, but I wasn't involved in any assessment.' Further advice37Wool crafts can be satisfying and enjoyable, for our own pleasure and to make gifts for others. They include anything from knitting, crochet and sewing or weaving with wool, to making pom-poms, amigurumi (Japanese crocheted animals) or yarn hair braids. Woolly notions You can find ideas and resources online (including 'how to' video tutorials) and in libraries and bookshops. Charities such as Knit- a-square and Woolly Hugs provide instructions to knit or crochet parts of blankets to donate for people who need them. Local knitting and other groups can be a great experience. Even while unable to meet up due to coronavirus, many have still shared photos and tips on social media and stayed in touch in other ways. Changing yarns Wool crafts can be adapted to suit a person's abilities as dementia progresses. This could mean moving from complex to simple patterns, or from patterns to block colours or plain knit. Someone else could help prepare by , for example, threading needles or casting on and off. Switching between crafts, such as from knitting to embroidery , may also work for some. People in the later stages of dementia could enjoy feeling wool textures. They might like sorting or rummaging through a crochet kit or unravelling and rewinding wool. If you're supporting someone with dementia and you enjoy wool crafts, spending time with the person while you're crafting can be a source of comfort and familiarity .Visit alzheimers.org.uk/ publications or call 0300 303 5933 for The activities handbook: Supporting someone with dementia to stay active and involved (77AC).

'It was my very talented nephew, Eric, who suggested that I record short little video memories, while I still had capacity to do so. It has been fun and healing, and I am delighted that others are enjoying them.' Gillian Holman in East Sussex, who's recorded people's stories for oral history work, says, 'It is not necessary to have expensive equipment. It's important not to take too long, as people get very tired and sometimes emotional. It's easy enough to suggest a break and continue after a cup of tea or even at a later date. Worth a try , it does get people thinking back.' Wool crafts Recording stories: What you said Photograph: FreeImages.com/Noche38Coping with changes Next issue What would you say to someone who's struggling to be 'the perfect carer'? Email magazine@alzheimers.org.uk 'The changes in my 92-year old husband over the past year are probably similar noticed by other carers. 'His mobility has worsened, meaning he is reluctant to leave the house to try and walk more than a few steps outside. He's losing more sense of where he lives and where \"home\" is. He's lost sense of which family member in the family belongs to who - doesn't recognise words like daughter , grandson etc so I try not to use them. 'I notice subtle changes almost daily and try and adjust my responses accordingly . Mainly , never contradict him or tell him he's made a mistake. Sometimes he says his memory is terrible and looks worried. In the beginning I used to say it was simply due to changes in his brain that occur as we get older . He can no longer grasp statements like that, so nowadays I just reply , \"Yeah, my memory's the same sometimes,\" and change the subject. A moment later he's forgotten about it.' mickeyplum 'One thing I found most useful was reading as widely as possible, as that has meant that when some new change occurs it hasn't thrown me. 'An example of that was the time, about a year ago, when my wife asked, \"Which Pete are you?\" I immediately thought, \"Oh, the Capgras delusion,\"and was able to deal with the situation very calmly .' karaokePete 'I found the best strategy was to ignore the thing that had gone wrong: do nothing about it, say nothing about it but immediately introduce a distraction: move to a different position or different place, talk about something entirely different, give them a very simple task (which you know they can do). 'It's heart-breaking: it all is - but that strategy reduces the stress they feel when things go wrong.' PARKLEYS Your answers T alking Point members' advice about dealing with how much a person with dementia has changed in the past few months. 'Keep the atmosphere calm and don't contradict, try accepting the new version of your loved one. 'Don't overload them with facts of old life but try to keep to your routines. I found that gentle touches meant a lot to my husband - reassurance. The sense of touch seemed to stay with him to the end. 'I knit and he used to love holding the ball of wool and \"sorted it out\". I think as a boy he used to help his mum holding the skeins of wool whilst she rolled them into balls to knit with. So it's worth trying to reconnect with skills.' Dartist 'From my experience, the start of the lockdown was quite positive for me and my husband. There were not many people around which helped manage social distancing when out. He was at a stage where all other guidance did not make much of a difference to his general demeanour . Other than repeatedly have to explain what he was picking up on the news. 'It became quite different upon emergency admission just before Christmas. Dealing with the changes that brought has been intense and difficult. I would say how you deal with it depends on how contact and controlled visits have been managed by care providers. I felt very restricted and the strictly supervised visits undoubtedly made matters worse for my husband. I firmly believe that deterioration speeded up due to Covid restrictions.'
