State MCH Acknowledgments No single policymaking entity or health professi9n alone can hope to appropriately address thecontemporary needs of children and youth. As participants in a multidisciplinary field ofinquiry and practice, MCH professionals thrive on partnerships. The presentation of this workshopand the publication of these proceedings is no different. Three organizational institutions hosted theefforts of several dozen people who were vital to the endeavor. While we as editors wish to acknowl-edge the contributions of each of these colleagues, we also note in this context a theme of the work-shop related to systemsthe wlwle is greater than the sum of its parts. A special synergy evolvedfrom the start of the workshop planning in 1993, through completion. From within The Johns Hopkins University Child and Adolescent Health Policy Center (CAHPC),Barbara Starfield served as co-chair and worked with us and other members of the Center facultyCharlyn Cassady, Mona Shediac, and Donna Strobinoproviding guidance throughout. CAHPC staffAlyssa Wigton and Lori Friedenberg translated plans and materials into graceful activity. Members ofthe CAHPC State Cluster GroupCharles Danielson, Sally Fogerty, Maxine Hayes, Cathy Hess, JanePearson, and Tom Vitaglioneprovided guidance in development of the workshop content andagenda, as well as translation of the proceedings into resource materials for state MCH programs. The National Center for Education in Maternal and Child Health (NCEMCH) provided logisticalsupport for convening the workshop, and editorial and graphic support for producing this publica-tion. Their creativity, expertise, and patience with our academic culture made it work. Rochelle Mayerand Laura Kavanagh provided administrative leadership. Paula Sheahan and Susana Eloy organizedthe workshop logistics, making sure all the while that we were comfortable and productive. Our won-derful wordsmith, Jeanne Anastasi, edited the 18 papers and accompanying text that comprise thispublication. We are grateful, too, for the talents of Kenna French, who added her artistry to our effortsas graphic designer for this book. Christopher Rigaux, Carol Adams, and Marcos Ballestero also wereinstrumental in the production of the workshop materials and proceedings. The Maternal and Child Health Bureau's Division of Maternal, Infant, Child and Adolescent Health(DMICAH) informed, encouraged, enlivened, and funded all aspects of this work. DMICAH DivisionDirector David Heppel's commitment to bringing together the thinking and work of academicianswith public and private MCH practitioners saw us through the process. Finally, our special gratitude to the colleagues who prepared papers and presentations for the work-shop and challenged our thinking throughout. We cannot thank them enough. vi Preface Anumber of powerful forces converged in the early 1980s to precipitate unprecedented changesin the delivery and financing of medical care in this country. Runaway medical inflation led tonumerous cost containment initiatives. The,severe economic downturn, experienced in almost everystate, contributed to higher rates of uninsurance and underinsurance. Concurrently, many indicatorsof health status declined, particularly among populations of women and children. By mid-decade,Congress acted to respond to concerns about declining maternal and child health status anddecreased access to health services by authorizing annual incremental enhancements and expan-sions in the Medicaid program. For the maternal and child health (MCH) community, congressionalaction was punCtuated in 1989 with sweeping changes to both Medicaid and Title V of the SocialSecurity Act, specifically in the area of child health services.Policy challenges found in the 1989 Title V amendments contained in the Omnibus BudgetReconciliation Act (OBRA '89) involved a new focus on meeting the primary care needs of the popu-lation along with new specific mandates for developing community-based systems of care and moreexplicit requirements for carrying out public health assessment, reporting, and other data-relatedfunctions. These statutory changes presented both conceptual and logistical challenges for the state-based MCH Block Grant program. Concurrently, the pace of change in medical care and financing accelerated to the degree that \"healthcare reform\" took center stage in 1994 as an issue of national policy concern and debate. In addition,state governments, professional organizations, the business community, and major health careprovider institutions independently engaged in self-examination and significant deliberation andactivity to determine new directions needed to address health system reform issues. To address these changes and challenges, the Ueral Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB) ini-tiated activities on a number of fronts to assist states in implementing the spirit and mandates of theOBRA '89 amendments to the Title V program. These activities include: vii Establishing the State Systems Development Ini..ative (SSDD grant program, whichprovided funds above the MCH Block Grant formula allocations for developing statecapacity specific to primary care and systems development responsibilities;Convening work groups to deliberate the intent of the new legislative language and toarticulate concepts, definitions, and federal policy;Convening forums to increase awareness of elected state officials and policyrnakersregarding child health needs, related MCH program mandates, and opportunities toenhance state action to address these issues; andProviding funds to academic centers and other nonprofit organizations to furtherthis work in support of nascent state efforts through materials development andtechnical assistance. As an extension of several collaborative initiatives with MCHB to articulate \"primary care\" and todevelop methods and tools for measuring it, the Child and Adolescent Health Policy Center at TheJohns Hopkins University joined with the Maternal and Child Health Bureau and the National Centerfor Education in Maternal and Child Health in April 1994 to convene the workshop, Assessing andDeveloping Primary Care for Children and Youth. Co-chaired by Dr. David Heppel, Maternal and ChildHealth Bureau, and by Dr. BtNnard Guyer and Dr. Barbara Startle ld, The Johns Hopkins University, theworkshop provided a forum for critical thinking and analycis related to concepts and models for con-figuring, under health care reform, a primary health care system for children and youth. The purposeof the forum was to consider public and private sector roles, and the resources and support needed toimplement effective systems of care at the community level for children and their families. A group of approximately 50 researchers, child health policy experts, and public and private MCHpractitioners and policymakers were invited to participate in the two-day forum held April 20-21,1994, in Baltimore, Maryland..Appendix B provides detailed information about the participants, whorepresented a wide range of national organizations, individual states, the Institute of Medicine, andfederal health agencies and programs in addition to the Maternal and Child Health Bureau. The objectives of the workshop were to: Articulate the parameters of primary health care systems;Explore methodologies tor assessing primary health care systems for children andadolescents;Explore elements of and methodologies for developing community capacities tOr sys-tems planning, implementation, and evaluation;Articulate the concepts of \"accountability\" and its measurement in systems develop-ment; andDiscuss the implications of primary health care systems development for state andlocal public MCH program capacities. \"l'o facilitate full discussion among participants, papers addressing these topics were prepared andshared in advance of the workshop, and selected participants served as respondents and discussionleaders. Discussion throughout the two-day forum was rich .ind provocative, as participants chal-lenged commonly held notions and debated opportunities for advancing an appropriate nationalresponse to child health systems needs. Although neither the purpose nor the outcome of the workshop included consensus development,several recurring themes emerged from the presentations and discussions: Poor child health status and health services delivery issues indicate that the system isbrokencommunication and coordination as well as new partnerships are neededto make a workable system;A conceptual framework for organizing and assessing the health services system canbe used to guide assessment and program development strategies and tools;lkiblic health roles are essential in order to address child health population needs;Public-private partnership models are evolving;New challenges, roles, and models require attention to systems capacity issues; and ix A new vision and societal commitment are needed to effect positive chiid health sta-tus and systems changes.These themes are discussed in the Overview in this publication, within the context of both the indi-vidual papers and the workshop deliberations. Dr. Bernard Guyer's Commentary and Closure on theworkshop follows the individual papers in this volume. The Johns Hopkins University Child and Adolescent Health Policy Center and the National Center forEducation in Maternal and Child Health prepared this compendium of the workshop papers as aresource for states, especially as health care debates and reforms continue to evolve at the state level.We hope this publication is helpful to MCH programs as they continue to provide public health lead-ership and advocacy on behalf of this nation's children and families.

Overview Several distinct themes resonated throughout the presentations and discussions at the April 1994workshop, \"Assessing and Developing Primary Care for Children: Reforms in Health Systems.\"These thenies, which provide the framework for this overview of the workshop, concern the chal-lenges of reforming health systems and the opportunities for organization and delivery of childhealth services:Poor health status of our nation's children and issues in delivery of health servicesindicate that the \"system\" is brokencommunication, coordination, and new part-nerships are needed to make a workable system;A conceptual framework for organizing and assessing the health services systemcan be used to guide strategies and tools for program assessment and development;Public health roles are essential in order to address the health needs of child andadolescent populations;Public-private partnership models are evolving;New challenges, roles, and models require attention to issues of systems capacity; andA new vision and societal commitment are needed to effect positive child health sta-tus and systems changes. THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN Opening remarks by David Heppel, Maternal and Child Health Bureau, underscored some of theways our nation is failing to meet the needs of children. In his presentation \"Defining the Issues andPlanning for Change': Heppel cites the prevalence of child homelessness, child homicide (the fourthleading cause of death in children), and alarmingly high rates of child poverty and hunger as clearsignals demanding national action. Other workshop presenters and participants also voiced these concerns, noting new stresses on health care providers, runaway medical inflation, maldistribution ofresources, and a \"disconnect\" between medical care and public health. Challenging a system of care that clearly is failing our children and youth, Heppel calls workshop par-ticipants to the vision and goals of primary care advanced by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau:Primary care for children and adolescents is a personal health care service .delivered inthe context of jiimily and community Primary care is comprehensive in scope andincludes servicesthat preserve health, prevent disease and dysfunction, and care forcommon illnesses and disabilities. Primary care serves as the usual entry point to thepersonal health care system. It shares with the family of the child or adolescent ongoingresponsibility for health care, whether illness or injuryis present or absent. The primarycare provider serves as the integrator of health services by furnishing most health careand counseling and coordinating needed specialty and supportive services. Finally pri-mary care includes mechanisms that assure the appropriateness, cultural acceptability;and quality of services being provided.This definition of primary health care for children and adolescents manifests the following attrib-utes: community orientation, family-centered services,\"first contact:' ongoing responsibility, integra-tion of services, comprehensive services, appropriateness and cultural acceptability, and quality. Toachieve these standards for primary care, Heppel urges strengthening the infrastructure for publiclyaccountable child health service systems built through public and private partnerships.Bernard Guyer's presentation reiterated the themes regarding current inadequacies in the delivery ofhealth services for children, observing that \"the system is broken.\" In their paper \"Health CareSystems and Primary Care for Children and Adolescents,\" Bernard Guyer, Mona Shediac, CharlynCassady, and Holly Grason cite the definition of a \"system\" as \"a set of interconnected, interdepen-dent components that form a complex whole.\" A system has three essential elements: .A system has a purpose or goals;2.A system has componentsstructures and processes that are differentiated; and3.The components must communicate to be coordinated. xiv16 \"Even if there are existing agencies, services, and individuals that provide care to members of a com-munity, the collection of the parts will form a system only if each of the parts is compatible with theremainder and serves to maintain the equilibrium of the whole.\" When people say the system doesnot work, Guyer continues, this usually means that a system does not exist. Guyer and colleagues cite the nationwide telecommunications system as a metaphor for understand-ing well-known systems that are in place in the United States, and describe health care systems forperinatal care and trauma care as representative of systems successes.In their paper, Guyer and colleagues also present a framework for understanding the functionalaspects of systems, based on Barbara Startle ld's model, The Health Services System. The functionalcomponents of this model include structural elements (inputs or health resources), process elements(intermediate outputs or health services), and outcomes, as well as population and environmental(contextual) areas. Measuring these elements alone, however, will not allow complete assessment ofthe system. The nature of the communication and information processes at the core of a coordinatedsystem also must be understood and scrutinized to determine whether a system canand doeswork toward achieving its objective. PRIMARY CARE AS A CONCEPTUAL MODELFOR RETHINKING AND ASSESSING THE SYSTEM In her paper \"Assessing the Status of Primary Care Services:' Barbara Starfield notes that, in theUnited States (in contrast to other countries), primary care is not the cornerstone of the health caresystem. Major provider organizations in this country have only recently agreed on a common defini-tion of primary care. Starfield summarizes the empirical evidence of the benefits of primary care,including lower mortality rates, well-controlled chronic conditions, and increased satisfaction withhealth services. She observes that the system of medical education has contributed to an inadequateprimary care structure nat ionwide. XV Startle ld's paper defines and describes the \"unique\" attributes of primary carecontinuity (longitu-dinality), comprehensiveness, coordination, and first-contact care. She further details \"derivative\" fea-turescommunity-oriented and .fiimily-centered aspects, as well as the \"essential\" feature of culturalcompetence. Starfield's health systems framework presents primary care as an approach to care,rather than a set of services delivered by a specific medical care provider. The framework allowsindependent assessment of structural aspects such as defining the eligible population, accessibility,and governance; and process elements, such as problem recognition, diagnosis, disease management,utilization, and satisfaction. This framework also can measure behavioral (or process) featuresrelated to patterns of utilization, as well as the extent to which providers recognize problems experi-enced by patients and existing in the community at large. Using the Starfield model defining the attributes of primary care and the health services system,Charlyn Cassady described the approach being developed at The Johns Hopkins University Childand Adolescent Health Policy Center (CAHPC) for assessing primary care provided to children.While some large data sets can be used to demonstrate certain brOad-scale needs of specific popu-lations, special surveys used as adjuncts to these large data sets can increase the specificity, validity,and reliability of information used for planning and resource allocation decisions, and for monitor-ing quality of care. Cassady's paper,\"Assessing the Status of Primary Care Services:' presents CAHPC's initial experiencein working with assessment tools to measure primary care at four levels: state or agency, community,facility or provider, and consumer. Cassady reviews the approach and the cautions related to each.Several tools are being developedincluding surveys and a Community Self-Assessment Guidetoassess the provision of primary care specifically to children and adolescents; these tools aredescribed in their specific applications in five states and the District of Columbia. Early pilot testingshowed a fragmentation of services in two states, and provided the foundation for a framework fordeveloping strategies to improve the current health system in two other states. Cassady notes that theexperiences gained in these states, in particular, have been \"instructive in showing how politicaljurisdictions can systematically address the important issues in planning for primary care services.\" xvi sA. Workshop discussions turned time and again to measurement of primary care, especially systems ofcare, and to the critical need for a population-oriented perspective to assess reforms in financing andservice delivery. Participants agreed that it is imperative to strengthen significantly the capacity fordata functions within public health and to share public health expertise with the private sector. Echoing this consensus, Deborah Klein Walker cautioned that \"unless a basic maternal and childhealth population-based system is developed and operates at all levels of government, it will be diffi-cult to assess child health status and monitor the impact of health care systems in the future!' In herpaper \"Developing Population-Based Data Sets at National, State, and Local Levels:' Walker states thatthe design, implementation, and monitoring of, community-based, consumer-oriented, culturallycompetent primary care systems for children, adolescents, and their families rest on the availabilityof population-based data systems. Data must be standardized for use across agencies, not based oncategorical program funding and reporting needs. Guidelines for developing integrated data setsneed to be established and must contain appropriate data sources to facilitate needs assessments andevaluations at the community level as well as state and federal levels.In her paper, Deborah Walker identifies the potential uses of information generated from an inte-grated population-based system and the criteria for standardization. A core data set, at minimum,should include four major categories of information: health status measures, service utilization indi-cators or process measures, sociodemographic and environmental measures, and behavioral riskindicators. \"The consumer health 'report card' of the future should include information on patientoutcomes in various ambulatory and inpatient settings as well as the health status of the entire com-munity.\" Walker illustrates the possibilities of developing such data systems at the state level throughexperiences of the Massachusetts Community Health Information System (MassCHIP). MassCHIPincorporates \"a wide array of state and community-level data into a single comprehensive databasesystem\" (census, vital records, hospital discharge, risk factor surveillance, disease registry, programdata). Walker notes that the real potential of MassCH IP as a model that can be used to carry out corepublic health data functions for all maternal and child health care can be achieved only when out-come data are included for the entire primary care system. xvii In their paper \"Assessing Needs and Monitoring Progress in the Delivery of Primary Care Services forChildren and Youth,\" David Stevens, Rita Goodman, and Norma Campbell address the topic ofpopulation-based data systems for assessing and monitoring primary care from the perspective ofCommunity and Migrant Health Centers (C/MHCs). Guidelines for developing high-quality, success-ful community health centers, developed by clinical and administrative staff from the Bureau ofPrimary Health Care and C/MHC representatives, are outlined in the document Program Expectationsfir Community and Migrant Health Centers. These guidzlines specifically require the following com-ponents to be included in C/MHC needs assessments: (1) a definition of the service area and targetpopulation; (2) needs of the user population; (3) needs of migrant and seasonal farmworkers; (4)special population needs with respect to geographic, economic, cultural, and language barriers; and(5) identification of available public and private resources. Stevens, Goodman, and Campbell also describe a Clinkal Measures Tool developed by the Bureau ofPrimary Health Care. This instrument, constructed around a set of measures that reflect HealthyPeople 2000 objectives, focuses on process and intermediate outcome measures and supports assess-ment of critical primary care interventions. Using a life cycle approach, the Clinical Measures Toolwas developed to be acceptable to clinicians and communities, to be measurable and realistic, and tocomplement other national data initiatives. Charles Danielson, Mary Anderson, and Kay Leeper discuss child health planning and assessmentin Iowa's Office of Maternal and Child Health in their paper \"Community System Assessment andChild Health Planning in Iowa.\" They present this issue through their experience gained in imple-menting the Healthy Foundations project funded by MCHB. Healthy Foundations works on a plan-do-study-act cycle with regard to the community as itidentifies, analyzes, and promotesimprovements in local systems of care. The project views community primary care enhancement as apartnership between the state and local sites, and emphasizes the importance of defining the com-munity in order to identify those who will be influenced by an intervention. Community, as definedby the authors, is based more on functional capacity and patterns than on population size, geogra-phy, or governmental organizat ion. xviii20 In the Healthy Foundations model, community coalitions are the keystones of local activity, wherebythe local public health agency and core leadership of the community coalition identify local resourcecontributions and provide assurances to carry out the Healthy Foundations prototype. Each coalitionis responsible for comprehensive assessment of its local primary care system for children. State-levelsupport facilitates this process by providing training materials and demographic and health statusdata to the community. The state also provides matching funds and physician education forums, andhas developed assessment tools for use by participating communities. The Iowa MCH program hasfound that using theimprovement frameworkrather than a problems approach is more effective,since it focuses not on individual health status problems but on the systememphasizingbuildingon what works and making it better.Lucille Rosenbluth's paper, \"Evaluating the Delivery of Pediatric Primary Care in New York City:'reports on the experience gained in evaluating Pediatric Resource Centers (PRCs), a pediatric pri-mary care program targeting high-risk children. The service delivery model includes six compo-nents: availability, accountability, accessibility, continuity, comprehensiveness, and coordination. Atwo-tiered approach was developed to assess PRC performance: a process evaluation to confirm theexistence of the model, and an outcome study to determine whether the model actually makes a dif-ference in the health and well-being of those receiving services. Currently, the programs are evaluatedannually through the review and analysis of project data collected from (1 ) a computerized datareporting system, (2) site visits, (3) chart reviews, and (4) quarterly fiscal reports. Variables used to assess outcomes were grouped into seven categories: physical, psychosocial, andfunctional health; preventive health behaviors; health knowledge and practices; utilization of healthservices; and unmet needs for care. Results show that PRC children were less likely to be delayed inreceiving immunizations, less likely to report health problems, and more likely to have received ser-vices through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).Five of the seven outcome categories appear to have been most affected by the PRCs: physicalhealth, preventive health behaviors, unmet needs for care, health knowledge and practices, andfunctional health. xixI4,, 4.. Overall, this evaluation has provided relevant and useful data for future program planning.Rosenbluth notes that \"the importance of provider involvement in the development of methodolo-gies, timely analysis, and feedback to field personnel, and the willingness to reassess and reviseapproaches as needed cannot be underestimated.\" Further refinement and possible replication of theevaluation model in different settings is the next challenge. The question of the appropriate role of public health agencies in design and oversight of managedcare health plan data systems also stimulated vigorous debate in workshop discussions. Public healthneeds to be able to access data collected in the private sector in order to effectively monitor commu-nity health status; participants expressed concern about the current tendency of managed care orga-nizations and other insurers to keep thi;information out of the reach of government agencies.Debate also focused on the question of whether public health entities should collect and analyze allhealth services data directly, or whether the more appropriate approach is for government to set andenforce standards for private sector data collection, analysis, and reporting. PUBLIC HEALTH ROLES ARE NEEDED In their presentations on the roles of public health, David Smith, Martin Wasserman, and other dis-cussants identified roles uniquely suited to either the private or public sector, as well as those thatshould be shared. The keynote presentation by Texas Health Officer David Smith set the stage for the ensuing presenta-tions and discussions on the infrastructure and accountability necessary to enable the health systemto operate with coherence, compatibility, and, ultimately, effectiveness. In his paper\"Delineating PublicRoles in Planning, Providing, and Evaluating Primary Care Services for Children and Their Families,\"Smith provides historical context for the current environment of runaway medical inflation, maldistri-bution of resources, and impoverished health status in many sectors. Overattention to financing inhealth care reform is linked in etiology to \"medical involution:' characterized by an overemphasis on XX1)t)Awk. tertiary care. Smith calls for \"front loading\" our health care investments with a renewed and strength-ened focus on preventive services and on the practice of community-oriented primary care.Building on the material in his paper, Smith's presentation described infrastructure needs andapproaches as well as roles for public health in pursuing this new venue. These include: Providing nontraditional care in nontraditional settings;Encouraging flexibility in both dollars and data;Developing population-based eligibility strategies;Using marketing and incentives to promote new systems thinking and new health-promoting behaviors; andRealigning relationships among community-based health practitioners, tertiarymedical institutions, and academic institutions.Smith highlighted key public health roles in putting these pieces togetherdefining and prioritizinghealth problems, developing marketing and media initiatives, leveraging and brokering financial andhuman resources, and monitoring and being accountable for population health. The critical role of local public health agencies in assuring community prevention strategies also pro-vided the focal point for Martin Wasserman's paper \"Public Health and Health Care Reform: HealthyPeople in Healthy Communities.\" Although echoing many of the themes outlined by David Smith,Wasserman specifically highlights public health responsibilities and strategies for assuring equity inhealth across populations through cultural competence, quality monitoring, and development of ashared vision of \"healthy people living in healthy communities.\" While prevention (a traditional pub-lic health venue) increasingly is brought into clinical practice and supported through changes ininsurance reimbursement, and the use of primary care gatekeepers is increasing, a significant \"dis-connect\" remains between medical care and public health with respect to the needed focus on com-munity health. Wasserman believes \"we must fully integrate public and private health cal e into aprevention-oriented managed primary care and community-based protective system.\" \"lb accomplish xxi(CY' this, a fourth componentimprovement of health status for the family and community as well as forthe individualmust be added to the national reform objectives of universal access, cost contain-ment, and quality. Wasserman reviews the components of the \"Blueprint for Local Health Departments\" (developed bythe National Association of County Health Officials and the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention), which envisions a system centered on keeping people and communities healthy.Fundamental to this blueprint is government res9onsibility for controlling disease, reducing environ-mental hazards, providing health information and education, monitoring quality, and providing\"safety net\" health care and wraparound enhanced services for those at particularly high risk orbelonging to hard-to-reach populations. Government roles also include public health policy groundedin science and supported by adequate data and surveillance systerris. Investment in developing thecultural as well as technical competence of the health care work force; research, discovery, and innova-tion; and development of linkages between schools of public health and government agencies are keyto meeting the challenges of the future. The most critical element, asserts Wasserman, is the need forauthorities and funding to guamitee a local government health presence with the ability to regulate,facilitate, and evaluate health care services to assure a holistic system of care. From the perspective of the private pediatric practitioner, Susan Aronson noted that public healthauthorities should be charged with the role of \"organizing systematic approaches\" to serve stressedand vulnerable families. She further called for public health to include specific functioi is: providing apool of resource profrssionals that can be accessed by private providers for referrals for care coordi-nation, home visiting, and other enhanced health services not efficiently implemented in individualpractices; organizing regional networks of specialty care; and administering community-wide pro-grams for environmental health, nutrition, and prevention and education. In the paper \"Accountability in Primary Health Care Systems:' Bernard Guyer, Mona Shediac, andHolly Grason discuss the divergent views of accountability stemming from differing political orien-tations. They note the fiscal focus many groups assign to \"accountability\" in debating health care reform. Alongside these cost containment notions of accountability is the public health community'squite different emphasis on accountability for the health and well-being of the population. The com-plexities of \"accountability\" are examined, drawing from Lester Salamon's framework analyzing thedistinct tools of government action available within government's current operating environment, byindirect or \"remote\" control. The authors outline these concepts, as well as a framework for docu-menting public accountability through a model of service efforts and accomplishments, in the con-text of ensuring accountability for immunizing children. Guyer and colleagues further discuss howcurrent notions of shared responsibility are implemented through the use of incentives.Issues of accountability generated vigorous discussion sduring the course of the workshop.Participants agreed that a major challenge facing accountability for primary care for child and ado-lescent populations is the lack of national consensus on societal responsibility for assuring the healthof the population. A strong rationale must be developed for assigning public health agencies the soci-etal responsibility for this accountability. PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP MODELS ARE EVOLVING Several presentations and substantial discussion focused on strategies for assessing and developingprimary care systems in a changing health care environment. Key issues concern (1) the organizationof medical and nonmedical health services in communities, and (2) local and state public healthagency roles in building community capacity and supporting public-private partnerships. Workshoppresentations and deliberations highlighted the fact that innovations are already occurring on theirownabsent a national reform template. In her paper \"CHIPA Community Model for a Comprehensive Health Care System:' Peggy Balladiscusses the organization of services in communities, based on experiences with the Child HealthInvestment Partnership (CHIP) in Roanoke, Virginia. The CHIP emphasizes comprehensiveness, coor-dination, and continuity of care. Through CHIP, the medical home is provided by private practitioners who enter into agreements with the public health agency, which coordinates care, assures appropriateuse of health services, and provides or arranges linkages for enhanced services. Care coordination isprovided by public health nurses who prepare a comprehensive health care plan for each child. Thereis a single point of entry, and referrals are made to an integrated network of services. The framework developed for assuring the community's capacity to implement the CHIP modelincludes building interorganizational public-private partnerships, developing and maintaining aresponsiveness to local needs, and combining and finding new funding sources. Balla describes de-ments of implementation success as ( ) community involvement, (2) needs assessment, (3) single pointof entry, (4) public health department wraparound services and tracking, and (5) blended funding. Public-private partnerships are the cornerstone of CHIP. This means the willingness of partners tocollaborate and share resources, to create a shared vision, and to share in the solutions and successes.It also includes the presence of leadership. \"Partners\" should be selected based on their power andauthority to effect change and open doors in the community. In addition, knowledge of resourcesavailable in the community, willingness to provide a long-term commitment, autonomy in datacapacity and support, and flexible and creative financing are fundamental to the model. The modelalso includes working tOgether to integrate health and social services, paying particular attention tosocial contributors to poor health. In his paper \"Primary Care Provider and System Challenges in Caring for High-Risk Children andFamilies:' Larry Culpepper discusses linking traditional practice with public health services. Hestresses the importance of establishing a medical home in the private sector with additional services(such as those required by high-risk individuals and their families) provided through partnershipswith public health services. Because high-risk children and youth require different levels of support,adequate nonmedical resources must be built into the private medical practice to enable the primarycare system to respond to their needs. Such resources should include transportation, translation, andchild care services, as well as specialized medical, educational, and social services for children withdevelopmental disabilities or chronic illness, and for families experiencing other dysfunctions. xxiv Culpepper identifies three basic models for private physician involvement with high-risk childrenand youth. The \"linked traditional practice\" is a traditional solo or group private practice in whichproviders refer patients to another entity that \"assumes coordinating responsibility and possibly pro-vides some or all nonmedical components.\" The \"activated practice\" differs in that the primary carepractice assumes greater (though not necessarily complete) responsibility for the high-risk family.The physician or other clinician may assume some case management responsibilities for initialassessment and ongoing care coordination. This model also may involve on-site or closely linked ser-vices provided by social workers, nutritionists, mental health counselors, or other professionals. The\"fully activated practice\" assumes leadership responsibility for developing a system of care within thecommunity for high-risk children and youth. This will generally require an on-site professional teamskilled in providing various services required by the high-risk population being served. This thirdmodel is similar to a fully functional community-oriented primary care practicethe primaryresponsibility for care coordination is assumed by the practice. It is possible that, over time, practicescould progress from the first to the third model. Jane Pearson's paper, \"Pediatric Primary Care Systems Development Initiatives in Arizona:' pre-sents Arizona's experiences in building a primary health care system for children where a statewidetask force has provided the backbone for primary care systems development. The task force deter-mined the need to develop a common definition of a primary care system, and later found it neces-sary to become proficient in marketing and community development in order to implement theprototype it developed. The task force ( 1) helped outline a \"blueprint\" for a primary care system that can be customized bycommunities, depending 3n the population's needs; (2) effectively increased community develop-ment efforts, viewing communities as \"our best resource for effecting system change\"; and (3) devel-oped a variety of service delivery options to enhance community capacity to assure that all womenand children have access to and use primary care services. Public-private partnership program mod-els include a \"medical home\" program,\"Passport\" program (medical record tracking system for par-ents of newborns), school health clinics linked with guidance centers and hospitals, and training and XXV technical assistance from the state to individual communities. Concepts and \"gold standards\" for pro-viding primary care have been integrated into virtually all programs within Arizona's Office ofWomen's and Children's Health, through formulating statewide policies and program strategies thatassure and support implementation. In his paper \"Health Care Reform and Public Health Considerations in Alabama:' Larry Menefeedescribes transition issues facing the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) in shifting froma significant focus on direct provision of health services, as health care reform is realized. The princi-pal themes involve the questions of how to transform the current two-tiered system of health careinto a system providing significantly stronger primary care services and necessary access, and how totransform the activities of A DPH to complement and support the reformed health care system. Three models or prototypes could accomplish the transition of personal health services currentlyprovided through A DPH: ( 1 ) the entirely public model, (2) the public-private model, and (3) the pri-vatization model. The public model, requiring additional investments in the public service structure,is not seen as financially or politically feasible in the current reform environment. Under a public-private model, joint operating agreements would be established in order to continue or enhance cur-rent services without additional cost. ADPH could continue to provide direct care, with individualclinics becoming integral parts of a primary care system. This public-private model would providethe opportunity to assure continuity of care at the public health facilities. In the privatization model,ADPH would no longer provide direct personal care, but would enter into agreements with other are-)providers (and possibly sell ADPH facilities, requiring the buyers to provide primary care for aperiod of time). The decision facing A DPH is whether to continue providing personal care services or to relinquishthis role to other entities and take on new functions. This raiFes additional questions about what thenew functions should be, whether they are best handled by state health agencies, and, if so, whatarguments are needed to develop consensus. xxvi NEW ROLES AND MODELSREQUIRE BUILDING SYSTEMS CAPACITY Maxine Hayes and several other authors addressed the question: What is needed to move forward todevelop an integrated public-private system grounded in partnerships and government accountabil-ity for population health? Using Starfield's Health Services System model as the framework for herremarks, Hayes outlined the state agency perspective on the structures, processes, and outcomes cen-tral to accomplishing the mission of promoting and protecting the health of women and children. In her paper, \"What's Needed to Move Forward? State MCH Program Perspectives:' Hayes notes thatnew organizational structures are needed within public health agencies to promote \"systems think-ing\" and the integration of activities across programs and populations. She foresees a major shiftaway from concentration on direct service delivery to the execution of core public health functions.\"Beginning with a new way of organizing our human and fiscal resources:' states Hayes, \"MCH willhave to retool staff for new roles, while deploying others who are uncomfortable with change, to theprivate sector.\" In the state of Washington, numerous smaller, categorical units have been folded intoa new structure having three major units for (1) all policy functions, (2) all data functions, and (3) allpersonal health services. Hayes also cites the need to develop public health agency personnel skills inmarketing, technical assistance to communities, effective communication, facilitation, negotiation,and community mobilization. With respect to process, Hayes emphasizes the need to institute agency practices for identifying, defin-ing, and monitoring health problems impacting entire communities. Hayes also says that \"our 'process'thinking must center on interventions that focus on changing behaviors if we are to impact health sta-tus.\" Adequate capacity also must be developed to evaluate intervention outcomes over time, and epi-demiologic methods need to be applied across programs and disciplines to track health status. New capacities are indicated for the private sector as well. In workshop discussions, Larry Culpeppernoted a number of provider issues that must be addressed if the linked comprehensive approaches are to be implemented to any significant degree systemwide. Increased data and patient care man-agement capacity and an expanded model of care and ongoing doctor-patient relationships are likelyto be required. A new common definition of primary care providers must also be established; suchchanges in practice will best be accomplished if guided by health services research and supported bychanges in the professional education of physicians and other helping professionals. For this to occur,Culpepper believes there must be expanded curriculum, community-oriented teaching environments(\"the Community ICU\"), and education-based research. Thus, closer scrutiny of the content andprocess of medical education is needed as the private sector becomes responsible for serving largercaseloads of low-income and other vulnerable family populations. Susan Aronson's paper, \"Meeting the Contemporary Needs of Children and Youth with DevelopingPrimary Care Systems,\" describes the Bright Futures guidelines as the backdrop for discussion of thechallenges faced by the private sector in caring for a larger proportion of high-risk and special needssubpopulations, noting that practitioners must accommodate to the needs, expectations, and behav-iors of these groups. Of major importance are additional time and flexibility in practice routines inorder to respond to needs, and adjustments to provider compensation for both in-office care and carecoordination, and for participating in community services planning and coordination initiatives. Aronson also calls for application of new technologies to reduce the paperwork and managementburdens of office-based providers, for the strategic use of incentives to change provider and con-sumer behavior, and for implementation of creative educational strategies to support the appropriateuse of community services for the children receiving care. Aronson finds that with \"special trainingon how to view and serve the community as another type of patient,\" much potential can be found inpartnerships linking private sector health professionals and public health initiatives. Aronson defines the essential system elements as (1) universal access to medical care, (2) commu-nity-wide environmental services, and (3) multisystem services to address complex issues impactinghealth, such as poverty and violence. Above all, Aronson asserts that what is needed to assure a seam-less service continuum for children is \"consensus on objectives of health services delivery.\" 30 xxviii A NEW VISION IS NEEDED Bernard Guyer presented his Commentary and Closure by synthesizing the many lessons learnedthrough the workshop. Using the three essential components of a systemshared goals, componentsthat are differentiated and defined, and effective communication mechanismsas the organizingframework for this discussion, Guyer concluded that value-based as well as data-based arguments,strong advocacy, creative experimentation, and s6und evaluation are needed to ensure that emerginghealth care systems serve the needs of children and families. The tasks of designing the roles of public MCH agencies in an era of organized, privately owned man-aged health care systems increasingly challenge the field, and will grow in importance in the future.Guyer noted that, ironically, the emerging managed care industry is already oriented toward using thesystems language and management approaches in thinking about its own developmentthe taskbecomes to orient the public agencies to thinking in this manner. The Title V legislation sets broad goals for child health in this country, and Healthy People 2000 artic-ulates these goals in specific, measurable objectives for health status and health care utilization.These national goal statements, which are population oriented and encompass all children and theirfamilies, must guide managed care organizations as well as public sector efforts. The components of an effective primary care system, coupled with implementation of a child-spe-cific standard of need, must be present if the system is to yield the kinds of positive outcomes thathave been documented in many European countries. Primary care systems can be delivered from avariety of institutional bases and through a variety of creative arrangements coordinated betweenpublic and private sectors. Clearly, however, all children's health specialists must be involved in thedevelopment of such systems. The standard settingregulatory and contractual authorities of pub-lic MCH agencies at the state and local levelsare the tools of government that should be used tobuild such a system. 31 Fundamental to systems theory is the notion that the components of a system communicate amongeach other to meet the commoil objective. At the basis of such communications are data systems.Current data development initiatives must be expanded to include the data elements necessary toassure that the system is working for the benefit of children. Future development of the health care system will be driven by the major societal forcesincludingshifting demographicsjus-ther efforts to curb the growth of health care costs, and less dependence onregulatory mechanisms coupled with more dependence on the marketplace to guide services develop-ment. In this environment, advocates for children must make the case for the benefits of organizeds'ystems of primary care as the foundation for the adequate develop.ment and health of our children. We would join with those observers who make the case for an investment strategywe must investin the health and development of our children if the nation is to have a strong and secure future. Defining the Issues andPlanning for ChangeHealth Care Systems, Primary Care, and Reform /am pleased that you have gathered here to address the important issues of children, primarycare, and the role of state and local health departments in ensuring delivery of primary healthcare within a comprehensive system of health care.Let's talk about basic belief's. Children are America's most important resource. How many timeshave you heard that cliche But, like many cliches, it's true. Children are America in the next century.They will be the people providing your food, your shelter, making your life more pleasant . .. orunpleasant. They will be the decision makers, influencing their lives ...and yours. As my friend BillHollinshead said: \"Th preserve, protect, and promote the health of children should be a high nationalgoal, because it is right, and because it is wise.\" Our standard of living as wc grow older will depend asmuch on how we care for and nurture our children as it will on how we individually prepare ourselves. byDavid Heppe!, M.D. During the 1990s and into the next century, our work force will be getting smaller. New addi-tions, for the most part, will be women and childrenall of our children. Our children, of whom one in five lives in poverty. TWo-thirds of these children havea parent who works full-time.Our children, of whom more than 100,000 are homeless on any given night, repre-senting the fastest growing group with no place to live.Our children, for whom homicide is now the fourth leading cause of death, exceptamong adolescents, for whom it is the second leading cause of death. For blackmales, homicide is the leading cause of death.Our children, too many of whom don't have enough food to eat, don't have a place tostay, don't have a stable home life, don't feel safe, and, most important, don't havehope. These are the people on whom all of us in this room will ultimately be dependent. Our responsibilityshould not be to assure that we have healthy infants or healthy preschoolers or healthy adolescents.Our responsibility should be to produce physically, emotionally, and educationally healthy, hopeful,and functional adults... because it is right and because it is wise. DEFINITION OF PRIMARY CARE Let's talk about primary care. There are many definitions of primary care; the Maternal and ChildHealth Bureau has adopted the following definition: Primary care for children and adolescents is a personal health care service delivered inthe context of family and community Primary care is comprehensive in scope andincludes services that preserve health, prevent disease and dysfunction, and care .forcommon illnesses and disabilities. Primary care serves as the usual ento, point to the 3,1 2 personal health care system. It shares with the family of the child or adolescent ongoingresponsibility for health care, whether illness or injury is present or absent. The pri-mary care provider serves as the integrator of health services by furnishing mosthealth care and counseling and coordinating neededspecialty and supportive services.Finally, primary care includes mechanisms that assure the appropriateness, culturalacceptalfility, and quality of services being provided. The definition of primary health care for children and adolescents incorporates eight .attributes: Community orientationFamily-centered servicesFirst contactOngoing responsibilityIntegration of servicesComprehensive servicesAppropriateness and cultural acceptabilityQuality Primary care for children and adolescents means caring for individuals in the context of the commu-nity, from which they come. It means having both epidemiologic awareness and knowledge abouteffective community and environmental interventions. Primary care serves as the bridge betweenmedical care and public health by incorporating a population-based perspective into daily clinicalpractice to facilitate community diagnosis, health surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation. Primary care means services provided with an awareness of the family as a major participant in theassessment and treatment of a child or adolescent. The family is the largest determinant of how healthservices are sought and used. Primary care for children recognizes that since the family is the unit ofliving in society, the family is also the unit of health and illness. As such, families have the right andduty to participate individually and collectively in planning and implementing their health care. 3 Primary care means that, as first contact, it is the entry point to the personal health care services sys-tem. First contact goes beyond interactions at the provider site and includes outreach specially tar-geted to categories of children and youth at high risk.Primary care means assuming ongoing responsibility for the child, regardless of the presence orabsence of disease. This responsibility of providing a \"health care home\" for the child or adolescentimplies accountability for the availability and quality of services. Primary care is a personal healthcare service. It focuses on the health needs of individuals and families. It involves a unique interac-tion and communication between the patient and the provider. In that sense, it is not only personalbut personalized health care. Primary care means that when other health resources are involved, the primary care provider has theresponsibility of transferring information to and from those other resources, participating in thecoordination of treatment plans, and managing the physical, psychological, and social aspects ofpatient care as capably as possible. This responsibility requires that the child or youth be seen holisti-cally, that the fragmented perspective of the specialists be put into a human perspective. Primary care means providing services that preserve health, prevent disease, and care for the com-mon illnesses and disabilities of children and adolescents. Preventive and most curative services areprovided by the same provider or team of providers. These services include clinical/technical inter-ventions and related auxiliary services; human support ranging from managing most psychosocialproblems to helping children, adolescents, and their families cope with life's exigencies; patient edu-cation; and facilitative services (i.e., services that enable the delivery of all other needed servicessuch as transportation, translation, child care, and eligibility services). Primary care services means providing services that take into account the developmental and cul-tural differences of the children and adolescents being served. Services should be acceptable togroups of people within the community being served who share common values, languages, worldviews, heritages, institutions, or beliefs about health and disease. 436 Primary care means haying mechanisms in place to assure that the range of services and proks-sional skills address the major health problems of the community's children and adolescents; andthat those services are delivered in accordance with professional standards. We in the Maternal and Child Health Bureau are committed to assist states and localities to developsuch systems of primary care. Now, let me tell you what primary care is not. It is not sexy; it is not glamorous; it does not get spaceon the front page ofThe New York Times, The ltrashington Post, The Des ,Vloines Register, TheAlbuquerque Journal,orTlu' Arizona Republic.It is not particularly exciting to the public. And (notsurprisingly), it is not exciting to political leaders. Unfortunately, however, a functional primary caresystem is the cornerstone of our efforts to maintain a healthy society. It is our basic personal healthinfrastructure. We may not be aware of the primary care system when it is functional, but we are cer-tainly aware of it when it fails. In 1989, my viewing of the World Series was interrupted by nature. The Bay Area earthquake andaftermath had all of America riveted to its televisions. Two pictures stand out in my memorythecar going into the hole in the Bay Bridge and the rescue workers attempting to find people in thewreckage of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway. Sometime later I was reading about this freeway. If yourecall, not all of it collapsed. It seems that in the late 1950s, a program was begun to reinforce the sup-ports of the freeway. In the early 1960s, money was shifted to other more apparent problems beforethe project was completed. Until that dav in October 1989, it made no difference. On that day, it madea critical difference.... Infrastructure. Do the recent events in I.os Angeles, particularly regarding thefreeways, sound similar? My brother, who is a lawyer for Paramount Pictures, tells me that it costs .$55 million to open thegatesno movie stars, no directors, no movies.

Measles, which should no longerexist, is on the rise. We have responded with a number of efforts to improve the vaccine delivery sys-tem. Care for children with HIV is a major problem today. We have difficulty in providing appropriateprenatal care. I submit that a truly comprehensive, family-centered, community-based system of carewould provide us with a foundation upon which to build an effec-While adequate healthcare does not equatewith maintaining goodhealth status, lack ofhealth care is a signifi-cant contributing factorto poor health status.tive programmatic response. And without such a foundation, anyprogrammatic responses we do make rjll be, at the worst, ineffec-tive, and at the best, excessively costly. While adequate health care does not equate with maintaining goodhealth status, lack of health care is a significant contributing factorto poor health status. We deserve a health care system that meetsour needs and we should accept the responsibility for devoting theenergy and resources necessary to produce such a system. How do state and local health departments tit into this picture? I seethe role of the health department defined in terms of the three categories described in the Institute ofMedicine's document, The Future .of Public Health: assessment, policy development, and assurance.Health departments are directly responsible for maintaining the infrastructure of the nation's healthsystem, i.e., both for population-based interventions like putting up a guard rail or fluoridating awater supply, and individual health care servics such as primary care. Who is responsible for individual health care for kids? If you ask pediatricians, they are likely to tellyou that they are responsible. If you ask a community health center, you are likely to hear that it isresponsible. If you ask some health maintenance organizations, you may hear them claim the respon-sibility. Many organizations are involved in providing health care for children. I believe the answer tothis question is \"all of the above.\" But if you ask who is ultimately responsiblewhere does the buckstop?my answer is that the buck stops with the health department. Someone must take the broadview, someone must represent the conummity. It is wonderful that health departments provide ser-38 6 vices to our neediest citizens, but it is not enough. Someone must be the synthesizer, someone musttake the lead. Someone must be able to identify the missing or misaligned pieces in the communityhealth care puzzle. I believe that someone is the health department. Others can provide direct healthcare services. Only the health department can play the integrating role. A \"TELLING\" STORY In Holyoke, Massachusetts, thtre is a private obstetrician who donates time to work at the local healthdepartment clinic. He is pleased to help and feels that the care he provides and the care provided bythe nutritionists, social workers, and public health nurses is tirst-rate. He then goes back to his privatepractice where he sees women who are only marginally better off than those he saw at the clinic. Butthe system will not allow him to provide the enhanced care of the health department. No social work-ers, nutritionists, or public health nurses. It makes him feel that he is not providing as high a level ofquality care to his own patients. It makes him think twi,-e about donating time. Health is a communityresponsibility and should be available to the community as a wholebased on vulnerability, per-haps--but available to all. In an ideal setting, I believe it would be best if health departments (lid not provide so many directpersonal health care services, but, rather, concentrated on the difficult task of primary care systemsdevelopment and supported those allegedly ancillary services such as home visiting, case manage-ment, and nutrition (which are unlikely to be fully supported in any health care reform, but withoutwhich we really cannot do a good job). We have a perplexing puzzle of health care providers. Who can turn these pieces into a mosaic, a plu-ralistic system that works? Under present circumstances, that role belongs to government. The goal of a functional primary care system fOr children (let alone for the rest of us) will not beachieved today or tomorrow or next week or next month. But it will never be achieved unless we 7 begin, unless we reach out to our fellow health providers, to our fellow human ser vice providers, toour fellow citizens. The efforts of this work group will help provide the perspective and the tools for us to move forwardin a governmental and private partnership to develop a functional system of primary care that meetsthe needs of children and families. It is a difficult task for which we have not been fully supported,hut it is an important task. We clearly have responsibilities far beyond our authority. But, if we do notaccept this challenge, who will? 4 0' Health Care Systemsand Primary Carefor Children and AdolescentsOverview and Context THE PERCEPTION OF A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM There is a perception in this country that the health care system is \"broken\" and needs to befixed. \"There is no excuse tOr this kind of system ...\" stated President Bill Clinton when heintroduced his health security legislation on September 22, I993.\"My fellow Americans, we must tixthis system.\"' The headline in The New York Times the next morning read,\"Clinton Asks Backing for Sweeping Change in the Health System:'2The purpose of this paper is to explore the concept of \"system\" in relation to health care deliv-ery. We want to raise the following questions: What does the concept of system mean? Is it useful?How can we use a systems approach to health care to improve the health of women and children? Holly Grason, M.A. Beginning with this paper, and continuing with the workshop presentation papers that follow, wehope to provide an overview of the concept of systems in health care and to show how the focus onsystems of care can be important to improving primary and preventive care services for children. WHAT IS A SYSTEM? The concept of a system is well known and commonly used in our society. Systems-related terms andconcepts have been used in management, engineerinr health, science, and the social sciences. Whenpeople talk about a system of highways, for example, they mean a transportation network that func-tions as a unit. When biologists talk about the cardiovascular system, they refer to a group of bodyorgans that are iThvsiologically coordinated to perform a vital function. While the welfare system andthe health care system may be complex, we should be able to understand their characteristics andprocesses in order to improve services delivery. A system is defined as a set of parts coordinated to accomplish a set of goa1s.3 In essence, a system isa set or group of interconnected, interdependent components that form a complex whole. Systemsinvolve three essential elements: I. 3.A system has a purpose or goals;A system has componentsstructures and processes that are differentiated; andThe components must communicate to be coordinated.We propose in this paper to take a common sense approach, rather than a technical engineeringapproach, to understanding systems. Systems stress channels of communication, flow of informa-tion, and decision making. Systems are purposefulthat is, they select outcomes as well as means14 achieving those outcomes. The central thread of any system is information and the flow of infor-mation between the various links of the conmiunicat ion network that supports the operation of thesystem.3 4,..\"10 When people say the system does not work, this usually means that a system does not exist. Even ifthere are existing agencies, services, and individuals that provide care to members of a community,for example, the collection of the parts will form a system only if each of the parts is compatible withthe remainder and serves to maintain the equilibrium of the whole. The essence of a systemsapproach is the focus on \"systems taken as a whole, not on their parts taken separately.\"4Example of the Telecommunications SystemBefore applying the concept of systems to health care, it might be illustrative to explore a systemabout which we all have common knowledgethe telecommunications system. The goal of this sys-tem is obvious, to allow communication between individuals all over the world by telephone. Thestructural components of the system are also well known, including the telephone receivers we havein our homes, our offices, and (increasingly) in our cars. The telephone poles, lines, microwave towersand other hardware components are familiar. There are practitioners, operators, who, even in the faceof increasing automation, act as facilitators and gatekeepers. There are processes including simpleone-to-one communication, long distance phone calls, teleconferencing, and complex switching andrerouting operations: few of us understand how these processes work. Finally, the internal monitor-ing and feedback commUnication within this system is critical, and, therefore, supported by elaboratecomputer networks.Other characteristics of the telecommunications system are relevant to our further discussions ofhealth care. For one, not everyone has access to the systeman estimated 15 million Americans(6 percent of the population) have no telephones in their homes.3 There are also financial accessissuesnot everyone can afford the same level of service and may be restricted to \"basic\" plans.There are multiple providers of telephone servicesalliances and networks. The telecommunica-tions system has addressed one aspect of a multiple providers and payers system, however, by provid-ing a unified single billing statement. The business and financial complexity of this system rivals thatof health care. When the telephone isn't working, it could represent either a personal problem or a systems prob-lem. For example, when a teenager drops the receiver and pieces fly out, that's a behavioral problem, 11 not a systems failure! However, systems failures can occur, unrelated to user behavior, that representeither problems with hardware structures or software processes. Several years ago, for example, thelong-distance switching in the entire Mid-Atlantic region shut down because of a computer pro-gramming error. This telecommunications system analogy also lends itself to understanding the notion of assessingthe system. The telecommunications industry is in the business of not only transmitting informationbut also monitoring the movement of that information. Again, the flow of information is the centralthread of a system. For example, we can assess how well the telephone system is working by measur-ing consumer satisfaction, number of phone calls that get through, delays in connections, and otherprocess measures. Finally, the telecomimmications system is regulated as a utility; that could be an instructive modelfor the health care system. THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM (OR NONSYSTEM) The use of the term \"system\" in connection with health services is relatively new!' The nature, size,and complexity of the health field compels a systems approach to the management of healthservices.3 For the most part, however, the discussion of the concept of systems in health care is moretheoretical and ideological than it is real. In many cases, particularly in the primary and preventivehealth care settings, the elements of a system are missing; we have, in fact, a nonsystem of health caredelivery. One major rationale for this workshop is to identify the elements of systems that can beapplied to children's health care and begin to develop these.Mandates for Systems in Maternal and Child HealthSince its enactment, Title V has aimed to \"create a state capacity to develop systems of care forwomen and children, including handicapped children.\"7 This objective was tOrmally added to the4412 statute by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89) amendments. For childrenwith special health needs, the OBRA '89 amendments to Title V added the Wowing: 'lb provide and to promote fwnily-centered, community-based, coordinated care (includ-ing care coordination services, as defined in subsection (b)(3)) for children with specialhealth care needs and to facilitate the development of community-based systems of ser-vices(emphasis added( for such children and their families!' Moreover, theHealthy People 2000objt.ctives include development of systems for children (Objective17.20): Increase to 50 the number cif states that have service systems for children (emphasisadded( with or at risk of chronic and disabling conditions, as required by Public Law101-239.9 The Maternal and Child Health Bureau subsequently incorporated an expanded version of Objective17.20 into the Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Block Grant application guidance: All states will establish a statewide network of comprehensive, community-basedhealth care systems(emphasis added( that serve women of reproductive age, infants,children, adolescents, and children with special health care needs; the systems will assureJamily-centered, culturally competent, coordinated services.lu Furthermore, with regard to the specific provision of primary care services, Objective 6.1.1 of IlealtkvPeople2000 states: Increase to at least 75 percent the proportion of providers of primary care .fOr childrenwho include assessment al cognitive, emotional, and parent-child _functioning, withappropriate counseling, referral, and follow-up, in their clinical pmc1ices.9By meeting these objectives and carrying out the statutory responsibilities for system assessmentand reporting, the Title V MCI I Program provides leadership at local, state, and federal levels in 13t't developing and auditing system response to the needs of women of reproductive age and the needs ofchildren and youth.Examples of Health Care Systems SuccessesRegionalized Perinatal Careand Regional Trauma SystemsTo make progress in applying systems concepts to primary health care, we need to demystify \"sys-tems.\" A good example of a well-known system in maternal and child health is the regionalized peri-natal care system. It exemplifies the three essential parts of a system: 1.Its purpose is to improve the survival of neonates.2.Its components are maternity/infant care units at different levels: Level 1 providesbasic care to normal newborns; Level 2 provides a higher standard of care for new-borns with some health conditions; and Level 3 provides the most intensive level ofcare to the sickest neonates.3.The components of the systemLevel 1, 2, and 3 unitscommunicate with eachother concerning patients, and individuals are actually transported from one level toanother according to their need tOr clinical services. Another well-known health care system is the trauma system or emergency medical services ( EMS)system. Again, our general knowledge of trauma and EMS care can be translated into the language ofsystems: 1.Its purpose is to improve the chances of survival for those saering serious traumaticinithry or sudden illness.2.Its components include various levels of sophistication of specialized trauma careunits and the mobile units that respond to injury events, stabilizing and treatinginjury victims at the scene, and preparing them fOr transport to the trauma units.3.A sophisticated communication system links the levels of trauma care and mobileunits, transmitting infOrmation needed to reduce response times in order to respond 14 to traumatic events, improve care at the scene of the event, plan for the care in the hos-pital, and monitor the progress and efficacy of that care. Access to the system, acrossthe nation, begins by dialing 911.Example of Health Care Systems FailureImmunizationUnfortunately, the primary health care system for children in this country is not working to assureeither adequate access to care or the attainment of health status objectives. The failure of this pri-mary health care system has resulted in the low immunization levels among U.S. children.Immunization coverage can be understood in relation to the three components of a poorly function-ing primary care system. 1.The goal of the primary health care system in relation to immunization services isdefined by such expert groups as the American Academy of Pediatrics and theAdvisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The recommended periodicity ofpreventive care visits and immunization antigens is well established and well known;nevertheless, primary care providers fail to set their own goals for immunizationcoverage.2.The components of the primary care system are a variety of providers in public andprivate settings that offer immunization services. While the number of providersmay be adequate, there may be problems of maldistribution in relation to certainpopulations and of lack of availability due to financial barriers. Further, the process-es of clinical practice and office management may result in a failure to assess theimmunization needs ot individual patients, inappropriate deferral of immuniza-tions, or missed opport u nit ies for immunization.3.Communications are, in all likelihood, at the heart of the failure to immunize U.S.children adequately. Primary care providers and public health agencies generally donot have systems for maintaining information about immunization of children atthe level of the individual child, the facility, or the community. As a result, the sys- 154 7 tern fails to transMit critical information about upcoming or missed appointmentsto families and providers. In addition, primary care providers may not be properlyinformed about contraindications to immunizations, resulting in missed opportu-nities to vaccinate. In this example, immunization is used as an outcome indicator of the functioning of the children'sprimary health care system. One of the challenges facing this workshop is to translate the concepts ofsystems in order to design and assess the effectiveness of systems of care that provide primary andpreventive health services to children. Many of the papers address ways of assessing and improvingthese systems characteristics. THE FUNCTIONAL ASPECTS OF THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM Systems of health care need to be understood, both by describing their components and the commu-nications that exist between them (a mechanistic approach), and by understanding the functioningof the system, To understand the functional aspects, a system can be thought of as (a) a set of ele-ments (b) linked together in a purposeful way (c) to convert input into output. Inputs, mainly healthresources, are processed through the system to create outputs, mainly health services. These servicesare an intermediate objective to the ultimate goal of improved health status for the population.\" Thisnotion is at the heart of the work on.systems. Startiekli` has developed a model for understanding systems functions and tOr devising approachesto measuring the performance of the system. The definition of the health care system provided aboveleads to a tOcus on three components of the functioning of any health services systemstructures,processes, and outcomes-- and on two contextual areas, populations and the environment. Thesecomponents and their interrelationships are displayed in the figure that t011ows. Figure 1The Health Services System StructurePersonnelFacilities and EquipmentRange of 1992 1 7 I StructuresMeasurement of the system's performance involves assessing its (I ) structural elements such as facil-ities, staff, and financing (or inputs or health resources); (2) process, such as treatments or otherhealth-promoting interventions (intermediate outputs or health services); (3) outcome (final outputsor health outcomes); and (4) their interrelationships. Historically, from a structural point of view,there has been very little oversight of health care systems in this country: they just develop. Forexample, financing and staffing issues related to primary care display little logic or purposefulness.PopulationsA system relates to a well-defined population that is being served. One critique of the current healthcare system is that it is not focused on populations but on individuals. In this case, the population isone of families with children who live in a geographic community. It is important to consider that thepopulation consists of those who use health care as well as those who, for a variety of reasons, do notseek care.ProcessIn contrast to the meaningful outcome measures available, process measures such as simple mea-sures of utilization are not always meaningful and often do not indicate whether services meet needs.However, processes are very important to capture because they reflect the informational aspects ofthe system.OutcomesThe objectives of the system are a logical place to begin. If one loses sight of the true objectives of thesystem, mistakes may be made in guiding the system into the proper channels for accomplishing itsobjectives.EnvironmentAt a minimum, environmental analysis should seek to explain the relationships between the system'senvironment and health status in a systematic way. This type of analysis should focus on an agreed- 1850 upon set of explanatory factors. In this way, changes can be observed in these explanatory data overtime and their impact on health status can be more readily assessed.\" A system operates within a larger environment. The environment of the system is what lies \"outside\"the system. However, defining the boundaries of the system can be a difficult task; this is especiallytrue for child health. The environment of the health system, for example, includes the public educa-tion system, the public safety system, and the social welfare system, among others. These other sec-tors must be seen somehow as part of the systeni. Levey and Loomba3 suggest that, instead of merelylooking at traditional administrative and managerial boundaries, it may be better to examine howthe system activities may influence processes in these external sectors. If, by some organizationalchange, the health care system can, for example influence the educational system, then some of theeducational process would belong inside the health system. MEASURING THE PERFORMANCE OF SYSTEMS Even the functional description of the system provided above still contains soMe ideas that areembedded and need to be made more explicit. These include, above all, an understanding of thenature of the communication and information processes that are at the core of the operation of a sys-tem. Without information, a system can't work toward its objective. The ability to measure the perfor-mance of a system depends on two major elements: information processes and standards.Informational Aspects of SystemsAs noted earlier, the central thread of any system is information that links the components of the sys-tem. A true \"system\" does not act in an uncontrolled way; rather, it gathers information about theresources used and how they were processed in order to adjust future actions so that they will hemore likely to achieve the system's purpose. The informational aspect of MCI{ systems has been a particularly weak aspect of Title V. Informationfunctions were lost with the evolution of Title V. The turning point probably occurred with the advent 19 of the Block Grant, where the shift in authority to the states was accompanied by a reduction inreporting responsibilities. Until the reemphasis in 1989, Title V agencies at the state and federal levelsgradually abandoned the important focus on continuously documenting the health and welfare sta-tus of mothers and children and studying resource and service issues. Systems for monitoring MCHhealth status have been inadequate; few systematic studies relating the structure of state MCH agen-cies to their performance have been conducted.% Further, public N1CH agencies have been slow toextend documentation to include private as well as public sector structures or resources, so no com-plete pictures have emerged. However, the 1990s have seen a rebuilding of the informational compo-nents of systems.Standards for PerformanceAny evaluation of a system's performance requires standards against which performance can be mea-suredeither a preset goal (the normative approach) or a comparison of one system with another(the empirical approach).12 These standards, values, and criteria must be applied to the system'sattributes or operational characteristics. Thus the attributes of the primary care systemfirst contact,continuity, coordination, and comprehensiveness .(see page 39)provide a basis for evaluating pri-mary care and a framework for assessing the level of attainment of primary care objectives. CONCLUSION Startle ld12 states that every health services system has two main goals: (1) Optimize the health of thepopulation by employing the most advanced knowledge about health and disease; and, equally,important, (2) minimize the disparities across population subgroups to ensure equal access to healthservices and the ability to achieve optimal health. In Starlie ld's view, \"Primary care is the means bywhich the two goals of a health services systemoptimization of health, and equity in distributingresourcesare balanced.\"12 The foe us on systems of care is likely to become more important with health care system reform.Government agencies with accountability functions, new organizations of providers and payors, and 20r:- other new structures will expect a higher level of performance from the health care system. Newpartnerships, infrastructure improvements, and mechanisms will be necessary to enable the healthcare system to operate with coherence, compatibility, and, ultimately, effectiveness. State MCII agen-cies will need to have a working definition of systems of care to guide their assessment and assurancefunctions.Acknowledgmen tsWe wish to thank Alyssa Wigton and Lori Friedenberg for their assistance with background research,and Barbara Starliel d for her editorial comments. 21 REFERENCES 1Marcus R, Devroy A.1993, September 23.Clinton all; rising coststargeted.

Health care has evolved into a complexmaze of disjointed programs and conflicting eligibility standards. The current national struggle todefine a responsive health care system has revealed a tUrmidable array of barriersstructural, cul-tural, and financialimposed on the health-seeking behaviors of individuals and communities.Society has elected to maintain certain tools of social and cultural isolation such as colonias, reserva-tions, ghettos, barrios, slums, and housing projects. And if we believe we have progressed to anadvanced societal plane, we need only gaze out onto the spinach liekls of Colorado or look up into the byDavid R. Smith, M.D. orchards of the Pacific Northwest to witness child labor laws being violated. Collectively, these barri-ers and conditions impose a form of social asphyxia that creates victims who suffer from preventableand disproportionate morbidity and mortality. This plight of individuals and a nation grappling with the consequences of a wholly inadequatehealth system is perhaps best illuminated by one literary masterpieceLes Aliserablcs. Victor Hugo'sprose grasped the desperation of a population seeking reform. It reflects the same tensions and frus-trations facing a growing percentage of this nation, business leaders, and the middle class who can-not access a system that was designed to improve quality of life and reduce suffering. The preface to Les MiscnibIes articulated a raison d'etre for that work which was appropriate for thattime, and is a warning foi our time as well as a justification for action: So long as there shall exist, by reason of law and custom, a social condemnation,which, in the face of civilization, artificially creates hells on earth, and complicates adestiny that is divine, with human fatality; so long as the three problems of theagedegradation of man by poverty, the ruin of woman by starvation, and thedwarfing of childhood by physical and spiritual nightare not solved; so long as, incertain regions, social asphyxia shall be possible; in other words, and from a vetmore extended point of view, so long as ignorance and misery remain on earth,books like this cannot be useless.thuncrilIc Ihnisc, 1862Focus on FinancingThe war on health care costs was unsuccessfully waged during the 1980s. The policy of deregulationcreated a postdated, large-for-gestational-age, fragmented $900 billion health care system. During the10-year gestational period, the\"fetus\" experienced logarithmic growth as national expenditures morethan doubled.1.-' It had been anticipated that this period would usher in spending constraints tobring health care expenditures in line. 24 A large proportion of growth in health care expenditures was realized in the high-tech and tertiarycare components of health care. Investment in preventive health services and primary care failed tokeep pace. In many federally subsidized primary care programs (often a barometer of health priori-ties), appropriation levels actually declined or remained at base funding.3 Less than 2.9 percent of allhealth expenditures were dedicated to support government public health and preventive activities inFY 1990.4 Per capita expenditures for health increased during this period; however, the nation experienced anerratic spending.pattern which accentuated the difference in resources dedicated to the \"haves\" andthe \"have nots:' Programmatic expansions for those atrisk were accomplished primarily at the expense ofother social programs or were so categorical as to be Too much attention has beenrestrictive, confusing, competing, and of little utility.3 focused on a single issue ofChildren with special needs, for example, often health care reformfinancing.remained on the \"disease-oriented express:' In addi- Reform will require a rethinking tion, when traditional curative medicine failed, oppor- 1of our current medical delivery tunities to enhance functionality were not recognizeuor seized. system to make it more patient-oriented and health-oriented. 'Rio much attention has been focused on a single issueof health care reform--financing. While One cannotdownplay the signifkance of this issue as a motivator or incentive for change, reform will require arethinking of our current medical delivery system to make it more patient-oriented and health-oriented. The present system has its roots in pathophysiology and has developed for the convenienceof the provider of care.Medical InvolutionThis same decade accelerated a process best described as medical involutiona process thatcoincided with an increasing focus on catastrophic care and resurrection medicine while simultane-ously abandoning sonic elThctive community-based primary and preventive care strategies.3-7 The 25 involution of medical care away from the community, away from populations at risk, and toward thetertiary care center began three decades ago and is now nearly complete. While the plight of ruralAmericans perhaps best illustrates this concept, the nation's inner cities have also suffered. Clinics,hospitals, and private practitioners have had to abandon high-risk populations in search of more prof-itable customersthose with third-party resources and access to these centralized delivery systems.Convenience for health professionals also played a role as they sought office space in proximity to thehospital and subspecialty groups.2 The process of medical involution created substantial nonfinancial barriers to care. As medicine leftthe community, transportation barriers evolved. Access to safe mass transit or barrier-free trans-portation often dictated who would receive care. The most vulnerable and frail were often excluded. Itis clear that the process of medical involution was not for the convenience of the patient at risk. A common theme defined those who were most adversely affected by medical involution. The impov-erished and the socioeconomically deprived (often children) suffered disproportionately during thisperiod, regardless of which portion of the life cycle they represented. Concomitantly, medical involu-tion at the local level often coincided with the loss of other community infrastructural supports andresources such as social service agolcies. The events compounded the adverse impact of medical,.,vivolution on vulnerable populations.3 Medical involution accentuates the efkcts of cultural ant.' ethnic isolation. As the nation ages, so dothe minority populations of this country. While minority (particularly Hispanic) populations, onaverage, are younger, a growing percentage of minorities are reaching the geriatric age. As medicine has clustered around central campuses, it has become increasingly difficult to providecare that is culturally and ethnically appropriate. The at-risk population often delayed timely carebecause of the culturally imposed barriers of centralized campuses. lIforts designed to deliver healthcare in the community by culturally appropriate health care professionals were to a great extentabandoned. Over the same period, small gains in the number of minority applicants entering medi-cine have been reversed.' 2658 CompartmentalizationWhile medicine underwent a process of involution, we witnessed a parallel process within acade-miacompartmentalization. The pathophysiologic nature of medicine was adopted by payers ofcare and academic institutions. Interestingly, public health adopted a similar organizational schemaoften dictated by the need to respond to a specific diseaseor cluster of diseases. This disease-oriented trend was These factorsexisting reinforced by patterns of reimbursement and priorities in patterns of health care medical research. These forces helped to sculpt a health.care system based on a disease-oriented medical model, financing, priorities forThe system often is further subcompartmentalized by research, medical involution,\"organ system\" into specitic areas of subspecialization. and compartmentalizationcombine to deny this country Nledicine has failed (with the help of the payers of care) to a true health care system. effectively bring together these bundles or compartmentsof knowledge into a .continuum of health care that canfocus on the whole patient. The delivery system adopted this compartmentalized approach and fos-tered a categorical response to care. This created further barriers and confusion for patients or com-munities seeking help. These factorsexisting patterns of health care financing, priorities for research, medical involution,and compartmentalizationcombine to deny this country a true health care system. lb date, thecountry enjoys a superb medical system that is built on a foundation of pathophysiology. The trend inmedicine has been to tbcus on diagnostic technologies and curative tactics. Preventive strategies andcommunity and public health are largely neglected by medical education. he existing academic sys-tem often fails to create or cultivate role models that could reverse this trend. The cumulative results of these events have contributed to the erosion of access to health care. in theUnited States, more than 39 million are uninsured; in the state of Texas, more than 3 million areuninsured, including 1 .2 million children. 1 '2- 27 An equal number are underinsured and lack adequate coverage for preventive services such as papsmears, mammography, immunizations, home care, or long-term care. Data indicate that, for certainsegments of our population, we have actually lost ground nationally. African American males overallare dying earlier, and African American and Hispanic women suffer age-adjusted mortality for cervi-cal cancer at rates more than twice those of Anglo women in Dallas County. Contrary to stereotypes,more than two-thirds of these persons work or live in the home of an employed individual.I.2.5 The emergence of a true health care system will require a more strategic tbcus that recognizes therewards of preventive health services, understands the interplay of all \"organ systems:' and then rec-ognizes the dynamics of a community that can affect the overall health status of a population. Ahealth care system is able to aggregate and apply new knowledge to an identified at-risk populationprior to their delayed visit to an emergency department. To be successful, this strategy of health mustreverse some of the trends of the past three decades and provide care for the convenience of the seek-ers of carenot for the convenience of educators, students, researchers, and providers of care. Theexisting barriers must come down if there is to be a fundamental reform in health care delivery. CHANGE AND INCENTIVES Business and labor have become significant participants in the debate on health care financing anddelivery. While labor disputes increasingly focus on health care issues, the business community isfocusing more attention on preventive services.3 Proposed changes in health care financing also may be conducive to changing the current medical orcurative system into a health system that \"front loads\" our investment with preventive services. Forexample, implementing relative value scales (designed to increase reimbursement for cognitiveskills) could improve reimbursement and provide an impetus fbr preventive services. Similarly, refor-imilating methods to allocate Medicare dollars for undergraduate and graduate medical education 6 028 could encourage academia to promote primary care training and incorporate prevention within themedical school curriculum.\".7 Additionally, the increased sophistication of purchasers of care and the development of health pro-motion and disease prevention as product lines for many health care providers have many hospitalstrying to position themselves for the anticipated change. The impact of these trends has begun to beappreciated by payors such as Blue Cross and Blue Shield, which recently released its list ofreimbursable preventive services. Innovative approaches designed to create incentives tOr both care providers and patients to practicepreventive health are already in place in some svstems.6-9 Reductions of copayments anddeductibles for patients who remain compliant with prescribed regimens are gaining favor.Increasingly, private practices, clinics, and health maintenance organizations are installing systemsdesigned to \"case manage\" patients with the aid of reminder files, phone calls, and home visits.8Finally, some programs such as the Community Oriented Primary Care Program at ParklandMemorial Hospital ( Dallas) encourage physicians to promote preventive care by linking incentivesto the achievement of health outcomes, such as the reduction of breast cancer morbidity and mor-tality in a target community. COMMUNITY-ORIENTED PRIMARY CARE AS A SYSTEM The trend to shift patient care from the inpatient to the outpatient setting will continue, if for noother reason than the payors desire to move care from a more expensive (better reimbursed) to a lessexpensive soting. This change in venue provides an opportunity for hospitals and their medicalstaffs to develop and implement new models of care that embrace preventive strategies and to posi-lion these systems to capitalize on changing incentives. 29 Significant steps have been taken in several communities to implement a community-based strategy,including the concept of community-oriented primary care (COPC). Developed by Dr. Sydney Karkand promoted through the World Health Organization and the Institute of Medicine of the NationalAcademy of Sciences)\" COPC is a way of practicing medicine that blends traditional primary carewith public health services. It is designed to pinpoint at-risk populations in order to improve thehealth status of individual patients and the communities in which they reside. Whereas traditionalmedical practice or hospital-based care is oriented toward procedures, dollars, and the number ofpatients seen, Community-Oriented Primary Care is an outcome-oriented program that defines suc-cess in measurable epidemiologic results.\" Community-oriented primary care creates a framework for providing integrated care on a \"one-stopshopping\" basis, thus minimizing repetitive administrative costs and fragmentation of care. The\"one-stop\" concept also reduces barriers to care (such as transportation) by co-locating such relatedservices as well-child, sick-child, immunization, health screening, and education services. The concept is predicated on the ability of a health care entity to understand and take responsibilityfor the health care needs of a population or defined community. Epidemiologic principles are appliedto identify areas of need and populations at risk. The community participates actively in ident4ingand prioritizing its own health needs. Resources are focused on health problems that are prevalent,preventable, and have the most adverse effect on the target population. The system is structured todeliver a comprehensive array of health services within a preventive framework. Consistent with the COPC program philosophy of delivering nontraditional care in nontraditionalsettings, outreach teams provide primary health care, prevention, nutritional assessments, and socialservices in schools, churches, centers for the elderly, and homeless shelters. While this type of care isoften nonreimbursable, itis clear that these services reinforce health-seeking behaviors and identifyindividual health problems and potential public health issues. 306 9 THE DALLAS MODEL In Dallas, Parkland Memorial Hospital has implemented a large Community Oriented Primary CareProgram supported in part by county taxes. The program currently focuses on health services in sixat-risk communities in Dallas County that were identified in a countywide needs assessment con-ducted by Parkland. The program is affiliated with The University of Texas Southwestern MedicalCenter at Dallas and the Geriatric Assessment Team at Parkland. Physicians working in these centersare granted faculty status by the university and provide attending coverage for the inpatient units ofParkland. This arrangment enables the Community Oriented Primary Care Program to providecontinuity of care between the community practice and inpatient settings. The program operates sixhealth centers handling more than 100,00() patient visits annually. A seventh center opened insouthern Dallas in spring 1991. A total of more than 200,000 patient visits are projected to occurannually. Minority health professionals such as physicians and social workers, many of whom live in the com-munities they serve, provide culturally appropriate role models. Bilingual staff minimize barriers tocare. The COPC program has the staff expertise to provide translations in Spanish and five otherlanguages. Dallas County llealth District's two years of experience in implementing the community-orientedprimary care concept has generated sonic significant results in the areas of health policy, financing,organizational structure, community assessment, and health services utilization. Although the pro-gram has been in operation fm less than three years, it has increased health services capacity in sev-eral at-risk communities defined by the original needs assessment, apd has maintained existingservices in several communities that were in danger of losing their service providers. Due to the initial success of the program and its focus on program accountability through assess-ment of health outcomes, both the County of Dallas, which provided the initial vehicle to fundthe COPC program, and the City of Dallas Health Department formally adopted the concept of 31tt; 3 community-oriented primary care. In 1991, the Dallas City Council approved the strategic agendawhereby the city's Department of Health and Human Services would make the transition toward amodel of health service delivery that embraced the concepts of community-oriented primary care.This commitment was formalized through a memorandum of understanding with the Dallas CountyHospital District. The memorandum called for implementation of joint planning and programmingfor community-based health services; more than 5730,000 was programmed into the defined com-munities collaboratively, enabling previously fragmented delivery systems to be combined in severallocations throughout the city. Financing the Community Oriented Primary Care Program has remained a priority tOr the DallasCounty Ilospital District through a separate component of the county's ad valoremtax system. Thisrate is established annually by the Dallas Counts' Commissioners Court and was increased for FY1992 to meet anticipated increases in service demands and to expand the scope of services such ashealth education, outreach, and nutrition. The program receives approximately 56 percent of itsfunding through the u1valoremtax base while the remainder is derived from patient collections andthrough funding from 10 grants. The program's organizational accomplishments have facilitated the growth of the program budgetfrom 5230,000 in l'Y 1989 to more than S12 million in FY 1993. The COPC prog- ni has provided aconceptual framework and platform to consolidate a fragmented array of existing health services. Four distinct communitv-based health centers were merged under the COPC umbrella during 1990and 1991. These mergers reduced duplication of services and administrative costs by S300,000 andmaintained more than 53.3 million in state, federal, and private resources already targeted to supportthese separate community-based health care entities. lore significant, the consolidation of thesepreexisting centers under one umbrella agency enabled the COPC program to use the savings fromreduced administrative overhead costs to augment services at exisiing health centers. These,ennanced services lyrically included nonreiinbursable services such as outreasocial services, and nutrition. f; i32ch, health education, The initial needs assessment, conducted by the Dallas County Hospital District, provided critical datarelevant to the health needs of the entire county. The methodology expanded the traditional indica-tors of underservice, including criteria for federal designation as a Medically linderserved Area orHealth Professional Shortage Area. The methodology used by the Dallas County Hospital Districtreviewed relevant mortality and coronary artery disease. The data were enhanced through an analy-sis of diagnostic data and utilization patterns of patients presenting to Parkland Memorial Hospital.The data derived from Parkland were geocoded to determine patient origin information and to targetcommunities that rely disproportionately on Parkland for episodic and hospital care. Although this initial effort identified eight distinct communities with critical health needs, a formaleffort to reevaluate the county was not instituted initially. In 1990, the COPC program began todevelop a methodology to obtain denominator data from the community. The goal was to use aninstrument that was reliable and valid, and that could be aggregated and then compared to a largerstandard data set at county, state, or national levels.To meet these requirements, the program initiated an effort to further delineate community healthneeds within Dallas County. The method oversamples defined communities (Standard Statistical(;ommunities) using the National Health Interview Survey (NH IS). This methodology has targetedsouthern Dallas and is a collaborative effort of the Census Bureau and a VISTA volunteer program.This initial assessment was completed in late 1991, after 1,500 households had been surveyed in thesouthern Dallas area. The data will enable the program to assess needs and consider revisions in thecurrent programmatic strategy and budget. Findings will be validated using focus groups from thesurveyed community. The goal of this effort is to establish an implementation schedule for the National Health InterviewSurvey to be applied throughout the county. This strategy will target all areas of the county and willreevaluate defined communities every five years. The plan may be modified based on data obtainedthrough focus groups or from other sources such as vital records or census data. The program has recently completed a hospital utilization study comparing pediatric admission ratesand charges in four areas of the county. This analysis sought to determine whether there were differ- 33 ences in utilization and gross hospital charges between communities served by a COPC program andthose not currently served by a community-based center. The four communities were stratified by socioeconomic status and demographic data. The west Dallascommunity, which had a I:mg-standing COPC pediatric program, was found to have lower hospital uti-lization compared to the other three communities. West Dallas had the lowest per capita income andone of the highest percentages of minority populations. Significantly, west Dallas had a lower admis-sion rate, one of the lowest gross charges per admission rate, and one of the best collection/chargeratios, indicating that patients were becoming certified for Medicaid through the COPC program. Trend analysis, conducted in the 1980s, indicates that, with implementation of the community-basedprogram, there has been a decrease in the admission rate and emergency room utilization in bothParkland Hospital and Children's Medical Center for children under 17 living in west Dallas. This trendhas not been found in the other parts of the community using these two centers for hospital care. FROM HERE TO THERE In 1992, the Texas I.egislature passed House.Bill 7 which reconfigured the state's 11 health and humanservices agencies. Among the changes included in the bill was the transfer of the acute care portion ofMedicaid to the Department of Health. This legislation provided the opportunity for the departmentto integrate this large program with an array of smaller, categorical health care programs. Given the success of comprehensive community-based systems of care for the delivery of familyhealth services, the Texas Department of Health established a new programmatic etThrt that will bet-ter meet the needs of children and families. The department developed a new Bureau of CommunityOriented Primary Care to bring together many of the public health programs established by theIndigent Ilealth Care Act of \"l'exas (1983), Title V, primary care programs, the Special SupplementalNutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children ( WIC), and Medicaid/Early and Periodic 346 6 Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT), and to link these programs into strong community-based, family-centered health systems meeting both the acute and preventive health service needs ofthe local population. The purpose of this new bureau will be to provide support for the development of community-basedprimary care health centers to assist communities in identifying and prioritizing their own healthneeds and to provide a feedback loop to strengthen the comprehensive health services offered.Programs established through this initiative willreduce the current fragmentation of services.Prevention will be a major focus, and the centers areexpected to track health outcomes and measure theeffectiveness of the services provided. This refocusing of services to thc community levelthrough the mixing and matching of funding ser-vices includes a strategy to pronlote COPC withinnewly established Medicaid managed care contracts.The Bureau of Community Oriented Primary Carewill have the added responsibility to position corn-Finance reform will drive changebut will not be sufficient toidentify and respond to prevalenthealth problems facing our urbanand rural communities, includingthe need for professionals trainedto deliver comprehensivepreventive care. munities for reform by developing new or expanded primary care capacities. This is particularly crit-ical in Texas, where more than 170 of the state's 254 counties are now designated as MedicallyUnderserved Areas and parts of 52 additional counties are so designated. Without a focus on infra-structure, the state will not be positioned to provide access to the estimated 3.5 million Texans whoare uninsured for health care. As part of this etThrt, the Bureau of Community Oriented Primary Care will focus resources onexpansion of school-based services that can target the needs of school-age children and the sur-rounding community population. The state already has several such models that have demonstratedtheir effectiveness at reducing vaccine-preventable disease, emergency room use, and hospital admissions.\" Rural and urban centers will be funded and designed to encourage public, private, andacademic physicians to participate in delivery of comprehensive primary care. Many communitiesare hopeful that such grants will assist them in recruiting physicians or midlevel providers (throughthe opportunitY to have an expanded practice focus) and in hiring nontraditional staff such as healtheducators, nutritionists, social workers, and school counselors. The school-based initiative will beincorporated into the Medicaid managed care effort. CONCLUSION The health care landscape is changing, and further change can be expected. Health strategies thatanticipate these changes will benefit the communities they serve. Innovative models of care thatincorporate preventive health services will benefit the health of our citizens al I produce incentivesto become healthier communities.Patient-centered therapeutic partnerships can best be established in community settings (asopposed to acute care environments). Models such as community-oriented primary care, which inte-grate prevention into their acute care delivery systems, are better positioned to respond to prevalenthealth problems and reduce preventable morbidity and mortality.While the current health reform debate has focused predominantly on financing strategies thataddress cost containment, it is imperative that reform efforts focus on accessibility and quality ofcare benefits for all Texans in need, including those at greatest health risk. Finance reform will drivechange but will not be sufficient to identify and respond to prevalent health problems facing oururban and rural comimmities, including the need for professionals trained to deliVer comprehensivepreventive care.Finally, a preventive health strategy provides a conceptual framework that is logical and that chal-lenges our present preoccupation with crisis medicine, including resurrection and curative tactics. Atrend that embraces health through provision of preventive services would refute the title of a \"paylater\" society and position this country to avoid needless human suffering and medical costs. 36 REFERENCES 1levy S. 1989.The triumph of 3.Mullen F.1985.

Easily delineated from consultative and referral care, it is clearly identifiable. In contrast,primary care in the United States is poorly understood and primitive in its development. Familypractitioners, who comprise approximately 10 percent of physicians in the country, are the counter-parts of the general practitioners in other comparable countries. General internists and pediatri-cians, however, are more of a hybrid, with a substantial proportion devoting at least part of theirprofessional time to subspecialty practice. byBarbara Starfield,M.BH. THE BENEFITSAND CHALLENGESOF PRIMARY CARE Evidence of the benefits of primary care, as assessed through various measures of the process andoutcomes of health services, is beginning to reach the scientific literature) Geographic areas withhigher proportions of primary care physicians relative to specialists have lower mortality rates frommost types of conditions2 and from undiagnosed conditions.3 Individuals with an identifiable sourceof primary care are more likely to have their chronic conditions well controlled than individualswithout such a source.4 Satisfaction with health services and indicators of health are generally higherin countries with more developed primary care systems.5 Rapidly escalating costs of care have led to emerging interest in primary care within the UnitedStates. The imbalance in the numbers of primary care and specialty physicians is widely recognizedas being at least partly responsible for excessive costs. Some health care reform proposals addressthis issue directly by providing incentives to produce increased numbers of primary care physiciansrelative to specialists. In a landmark action, the American Board of Family Medicine and theAmerican Board of Internal Medicine joined forces to promulgate a definition of primary care thattits the concept of primary care in other countries. Primary care can be defined as continuous, com-prehensive, and coordinated care provided to populations undifferentiated by gender, disease, or organsystem!' Acceptance of this definition will provide the country with a good basis for planning andevaluation of primary care. Decades of inattention to the deterioration of the primary care structure of the U.S. health systemhave left the system of medical education unprepared to deal with the new challenge to reorient med-ical practice. The tradition of hospital-oriented training is unsuited to training for practice in thecommunity. Most faculty in medical schools are specialists who have little knowledge of the way inwhich problems present to physicians in the community, and the preponderance of focus on patientswith more unusual diseases produces physicians who overestimate the likelihood that the patients 40 they see will have such problems rather than the more common ailments (many of them undiagnos-able) encountered in primary care. As a result, they carry out more diagnostic tests and generatehigher costs than are warranted. Poor training for primary care also results in a lack of attention to the important and unique corre-lates of primary care practice: long-term relationships with individuals as persons (distinct fromindividuals characterized by the presence of a particular disease); comprehensiveness of care thatincludes attention to prevention, mental health, and the impactof social conditions in compromising health; coordination ofservices with a responsibility to integrate all aspects of carereceived by individuals in the course of their illnesses; andachievement of tirst-contact care, which implies an accessibilityand availability to meet health care needs at the time they occurrather than at the physician's convenience. Apart from these four features that are unique to primary care,several other aspects of primary care need to be incorporatedinto training. Two of thesecommunity orientation and fam-ily centerednessmay be considered derivative features sincethey are actually an extension of comprehensiveness. In othei words, for health service providers tobe highly effective in recognizing the health needs of their populations and providing the full rangeof services needed to deal with them, these providers will have to be community oriented and fam-ily centered. One other featurecultural competenceis often included in the requirements forprimary care. Since all levels of health care (including consultative and referral care) should be pro-vided with attention to different cultural needs, cultural competence is essential but is not unique toprimary care.Decades of inattention tothe deterioration of theprimary care U.S. health systemhave left the system ofmedical educationunprepared to deal withthe new challenge toreorient medical practice. 41 MEASUREMENT OF THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTSOF PRIMARY CARE Fortunately, it is now possible to define and measure both the unique aspects of primary care andits derivative and essential features. Drawing from the definition stated above, primary carc is con-tinuous over time (or longitudinal), focused on the patient as a person (regardless of the diagnosisor organ system involved), comprehensive, and coordi-The important and uniquecorrelates of primary carepractice are long-termrelationships with persons, comprehensivenessof care, coordination ofservices, and achievement offirst-contact care.nated. Primary care also is first-contact or the first pointof entry into the health care system for new problems.These are the unique features of primary care. Other levels of care may aspire to one or more of these fea-tures (for example, emergency services may be tirst-con-tact). But only primary care assumes responsibility for allfour. I n addition, primary care includes derivative features:family centeredness and community orientation. They arederivative because they arc achieved by high levels of per-formance on the unique features of primary care. Otherfeatures are essential but not unique, because they are shared with other levels of care. They entailsuch features as cultural competence. Each of the features of primary care can be represented by some structural feature of the health caresystem and by another feature that reflects the desired behavior. The structural feature makes it i)os-sible for the practitioner to provide services in certain ways, and the process feature is the desiredbehavior itself. Measurement of both makes it possible to dctermine whether the health services aredesigned to deliver primary care services and whether the services actually are delivered in theappropriate way. 42 Structural Features of Primary CareThe structural features to be considered in an evaluation of the potential for delivering primary careare () arrangements for accessibility to services, (2) the extent to which a formal relationship existsbetween a provider or team of providers and the specific individuals, (3) the range of services offeredby the provider(s), and (4) the existing arrangements for continuity (in both personnel and records). Arrangements for accessibility are necessary if the facility is to be used as the point of first contact. Ifthe facility does not arrange to provide services that are congenial in time, place, and accommoda-tions, people either will not seek care or will seek care where it is more accessible and available. A formal relationship between practitioners and patients is important for longitudMality. This typeof relationship can be symbolized by the presence of a roster of patients for whom the practitioner isresponsible, and by a formal or informal contract that recognizes this relationship at least for a givenperiod of time.Achievement of comprehensiveness requires that the facility have available a range of servicesneeded to deal with common problems in the population. Many of these common services are thesame, regardless of the population served. Some, however, may be unique in certain populations. Forexample, in areas where substance abuse is high, its management should be part of primary carerather than referral services. The key consideration is deciding between those services to be requiredin primary care and those services that can be arranged for by referral, based on the frequency of theproblem in the population served. The structural requirement for achieving coordination is a mechanism to ensure communication ofinformation. Conventionally, this repository of information consists of the practitioners themselves,aided by medical records and other information systems. Studies have shown, however, that informa-tion transfer can be enhanced by improvements in medical records and by more effective team workin health care facilities. Some innovative practices are exploring the benefits of having patientsreview or even keep their own medical recordsthis information can be very useful in helping prac- 43 titioners coordinate care and avoid unnecessary and perhaps inappropriate interventions. Each ofthese four structural features is necessary in the evaluation of the potential for tirst-contact, for Ion-gitudinality, for comprehensiveness, and for coordination of services. Process Features of Primary CareThe achievement of high performance levels of primary care can be assessed at two levelsthelevel at which use occurs (i.e., the facility) and the level of the population. To assess the level of thefacility or provider, the experiences of those using the facility are determined. The perspective ofusers of facilities are likely to be very different from those of non-users, and it is important to recog-nize that information obtained from users may give an entirely different cast to the evaluation ofcare than that obtained from individuals in the community. Non-users, even if they are enrolled in afacility and report it as their \"regular source of care,\" are more likely to have experienced barriers toseeking care, and may be more ill and therefore less able to use services when effort is required toreach them. Thus, great care must be taken when interpreting the results of surveys of users of facilities, espe-cially if the sample of individuals surveyed is chosen from daily lists of visitors. These lists will over-represent more frequent users, who are more likely to be those who find it easiest to get to the facility.A better sampling frame is a list of those who made any visit to the facility in a period of time (suchas one year or two years). since it is much less likely to overrepresent frequent users. The best way toassess a population's experiences with primary care services is to take the sample from a list ofenrollees (those who are eligible to receive care from the facility). This sample will include users aswell as non-users and will provide a more accurate view of access and satisfaction with services thanwill a user-oriented approach. The behavioral (or process) fe,Itures that are responsible for translating the potential into a realityhave to do with patterns of utilization and the extent to which practitioners in the facility recognizethe problems experienced by patients and existing in the community at large. 44 First-contact care is achieved when people seek their care first from the provider or facility, ratherthan going elsewhere (to a specialist or emergency service, for example). Longitudinality is achieved when both the provider and patient recognize ffiat they know each otherand have a mutual relationship that is manifested when that practitioner is involved in all aspects ofthe patient's care, not just the patient's specific problem.Comprehensiveness is achieved when it can be demonstrated that all common problems in theenrolled community or patient population are being handled in primary care rather than by referral,and when all problems or health concerns experienced by patients are recognized by the provider. Itis in the area of comprehensiveness that issues related to the provision of all types of services are ofconcern, for both mental and physical health problems, and with regard to care of acute conditions,ongoing care for people with special health needs, and preventive care.Coordination is achieved when information about people that derives from visits elsewhere or toother health related services is transmitted to and recognized by the primary care provider. MEASUREMENT OF THE OTHER FEATURESOF PRIMARY CARE Like the unique features of primary care, the derivative and essential features can be measured usingthe same framework.Community OrientationCommunity 01 ientation involves consideration of several structural characteristics: ( ) Definition ofan eligible population, (2) information systems, and (3) governance mechanisms.First, in order to focus on the community, the population must be defined in such a way as tocharacterize it. 45 Second, information systems that reflect existing health problems must be in place. One of theimportant roles of the public health sector has been to develop information on community healthneeds, by means of vital statistics systems, surveillance mechanisms (such as reporting systems andcase registers), and special surveys (such as the National Health Interview Survey). The challengeposed by health care reform is to integrate these traditional public health data systems with clinicaldata systems; the combination of the two will enable responsible agencies and health systems to gaina full picture of health needs of their communities. Third, governance mechanisms are also important in achieving community orientation, since thecommunity itself should be involved in setting priorities for its health care, given informationobtained from data systems concerning existing health needs.Family OrientationFamily orientation has at least two components. The first involves the recognition of clusters of ill-ness or predisposition to illness as a result of either genetic or shared socioenvironmental exposures.The second involves consideration of family dynamics that influence the family's recognition ofexisting health needs and also influence an individual's ability to use health services and to benefitfrom them. Thus, family orientation requires data systems that prompt inquiry into family dynamicsand interrelationships and also requires the provision of a range of services that address these familycharacteristics. Cultural CompetenceThe final characteristic of primary carean essential but not unique aspectis cultural compe-tence. Cultural competence is facilitated by addressing the personnel component of the structure ofservices. Employing staff with cultural characteristics similar to those of the population served is onemechanism for incorporating cultural sensitivity into service provision. The structural feature ofgovernance is also pursuant to cultural competence, since representation of community memberswill provide a perspective that otherwise would be lacking. 46 EVALUATIONS OF PRIMARY CARE SYSTEMS This framework has led to several evaluations of primary care. The first evaluation came at therequest of the local ir edical society. In response, Weiner et al.: evaluated the extent and distributionof primary care services available to the population of an entire metropolitan area. The assessmentrehed upon information obtained in a sample of office practices of different types of specialists. Bothpatients and office staff were queried to obtain information on both structural and behavioral fea-tures of primary care. Wilson et al.s assessed the extent to which their pediatric primary care teaching practice attainedlevels of primary care equivalent to those in the community at large, and Barker et al.9 determinedwhether their internal medicine-training program attained a pre-set level of performance on the fea-tures of primary care. Both of these studies relied on information from medical records rather thanpractitioners or patients. Blackused both claims and survey data to determine the extent to which certain aspects of primarycare were achieved by a sample of elderly residents of an entire Canadian province. Noble et al.\"applied the same framework to a comparison of residencies in both internal medicine and pediatrics,using information obtained from queries of directors of clinical facilities. They found that trainingprograms designed to be primary care oriented were, in fact, attaining higher levels of performanceon the structural features of primary care than were conventional training programs. The staff of. the Child and Adolescent Health Policy Center at The Johns Hopkins University have beenexploring the possibility of applying the method to assessing primary care provided to children in sev-eral entire states. he specific experiences of the Child and Adolescent Health Policy Center in develop-ing assessntent instrmnents.for such use are described in \"Assessing the Status of Primary Care Services:Early Experiences of the Child and Adolescent Health Policy Center in Evaluating Primary Care\" in thisvolume (page 65). 47 0, Ehrlich M F;eiQ L.

We must advocate for a future of public health in which all of these roles or functionsthroughout the entire health care system (whether financed with public or private dollars) are inte- byDeborah Klein Milker, Ed.D. grated at state and local levels. To accomplish this goal, traditional surveillance and vital statisticsdatabases in public health departments will need to be managed and analyzed, along with health sta-tus outcomes from a variety of primary care and other clinical settings. The consumer health \"reportcard\" of the future should include information on patient outcomes in various.ambulatory andinpatient settings as well as the health status of the entire community. All data in these communityand facility report cards should be available by key indicators (such as race/ethnicity, health carepayor, and others). Consistent, effective, ongoing policy development and program evaluation can be achieved only whena population-based responsive data system is available. Information from an integrated pOpulation-based data system potentially can be used to: 1.Conduct local and state needs assessments;2.Monitor state-mandated programs/screenings;3.Comply with federal data reporting requirements (Title V. Medicaid, Healthy People2000 objectives);4.Direct program planning and management;3.Conduct program and service evaluations; and6.Assure follow-up services after identification.To meet these objectives, the data system must use standard definitions, and must be comprehensivein scope, accessible via computer technology and information highways of the future, updated regu-larly with the most current year's data, and available for a range of geopolitical entities (census track,zip codes, town, county, city, region). Given today's technology, a system can be designed and con-nected at many levels so that billing, patient monitoring, and quality assurance can take place at localprovider levels. Selected subsets of aggregate or individually identifiable data can be shared at largergeographic levels (city, county, state) for health planning, monitoring of health status, and qualityassurance. Many current data initiatives exist at all levels of government and in the private health care industry;however, there has been little planning or discussion of how these initiatives tit together to form a population-based data system that can be used by a variety of stakeholders in planning and monitor-ing a primary care system for children and youth. Most of today's data initiatives have been devel-oped to meet the needs of (1) a specific health content issue (such as immunization rates, HIVreports, adolescent pregnancy rates), or (2) a specific management information system (such as mea-suring distribution of food vouchers to women and children eligible for Special SupplementalNutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children IWICI services, or tracking entry into prenatalcare or early intervention programs). Most maternal and child health (MCH) data sources haveevolved only because of available funding to meet a particular requirement at the state or federal level.State and national health care reform debates offer many opportunities to discuss the need for apopulation-based data system to track the health status of the population by various providerarrangements and to monitor the impact of changes in access to health care over time. Current statereform initiatives in managed care, adolescent health, school health, and children with special healthneeds should be used as mechanisms for developing a population-based data infrastructure.A population-based data system with quantitative information on health status and health serviceutilization patterns will always be a starting point for local needs assessments and evaluations. Sinceno data system will be expansive enough to answer all questions related to health status and healthplanning at the local level, qualitative information and local data will most likely need to be collectedfrom focus groups, individual interviews, and local data sources to enhance the meaning of thehealth indicators generated in a population-based child health data system. Finally, a community-level population-based data system potentially can help document the cost sav-ings of community prevention and health promotion activities as well as the functioning of variousprimary care practice arrangements within a community. The data generated will not only assist par-ents in choosing primary care providers for their children, hut will also assist parents and others toadvocate for and participate in community system changes needed to enhance the health status ofchildren and youth in their locality. Since none of these activities can happen effectively without hav-ing population-based data available to all, we should begin to build these maternal and child healthdata systems. 51 CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION A population-based data system at any level of accountability should include data in four major cate-gories: health status measures, service utilization indicators or process measures, sociodemographicand environmental measures, and behavioral risk indicators. Indicators in any of these four categori-cal areas can range from a minimal set of core items to an expansive list of items offering rich detailand elaboration in a particular health area. Both in the literature and in practice, the debate continues about which items should be included in apopulation-based data system spanning the age range from birth through adolescence.2 Special con-cerns involve adequately addressing race and ethnicity so that planning and health status monitoringcan be conducted effectively for these subgroups, and can include data on the health outcomes ofsubgroups such as children with special health needs (rather than eliminating health outcomes databecause of lack of agreement about how to assess health functioning). Examples of items in the four categories comprising population-based data systems are presented intables I to 3. Table 1 lists the items used in the Harvard Community Child Health Studies to assesshealth status and evaluate maternal and child health services in counties in Michigan andMassachusetts.3 This example illustrates thy breadth and depth Of information that can be collectedin all domains using a variety of data sourccs. Tables 2 and 3 provide examples to illustrate minimaldata components (see pages 55 and 57). Under the State Systems Development Initiative, all state Title V MCH agencies have been awardedenhanced grants to assist state efforts to build community-based, family-centered systems of pri-mary care for children and youth. One goal of the Massachusetts Child Health 2000 SystemsDevelopment Initiative is to develop and implement a core minimal data set for primary careproviders in the state. Draft recommendations for this data set are listed in table 2. Mcissachusetts and the five other New England states are also participating in the development of amodel school health information system.

POTENTIAL POPULATION-BASED DATA SOURCES Table 4 lists potential population-based data sources available at federal, state, and local levels in fourmajor categories: surveys, vital statistics, surveillance systems/disease registries, and program/service management information systems. Although many data sources are currently available, sig-nificant issues concerning content and use of these sources have resulted in a dearth of informationavailable for local and state planners and evaluators of child health primary care systems.Most surveys available today provide data at the national level; however, the need for population-based data for planning and monitoring is acute at the state and local levels. All of the national sur-veys (see table 4, page 58) would provide valuable information for state and local levels if the samples 54Or Ta b 1 e 2Recommendations for Pediatric Primary Care Minimum Data SetItemIndicator 1.Personal number, or both2.Mother's identifier: both3.Residence code or zip code or address4.Date of birth of child5.Sex6.Race of child or of mother and father7.Ethnicity/ancestry of child or of mother and father8.Language most often spoken in the child's home9.Type of insurance coverage...public, private, none10.Evidence of developmental delay (Yes/no)11.Chronic, disabling condition or disability (Yes/no)12.Limited parenting, inadequate shelter, open or confirmed protective service investigation, substanceabuse in the home, family conditions (Yes/no)13.Environmental hazards, use of tobacco in home (Yes/no)14.Evidence of problematic source of primary care (past problem or present access problem) (Yes/no)15.Date of visit16.Type of visit (emergency, sick visit, follow-up, well visit)17.Provider code18.Problem or diagnosis19.Disposition (death, referral, follow-up, concluded immunization status at encounter (Yes/no)21.Height22.Weight23.Hematocrit Source: Child I lealth WOO Systems Development Initiative, Bureau of Family and Community Health,Massachusetts Department of Public Health (1990. 55BEST COPY AVA '; (AKE Ta b I e 2 (continued)Recommendations for Pediatric Primary Care Minimum Data Set (continued)ItemIndicator 24.Emergency department use > use x times in the past year (Yes/no)25.Hospitalization use > use x times in the past year (Yes/no)26.Asthma (Yes/no)For children under 227.Breastfeeding 4 months postpartum (Yes/no)For children under 628.Blood lead level or EP level29.WIC status (Not eligible, Enrolled, Referred and pending)30.Early intervention status (Not eligible, Enrolled, Referred and pending)For children 6-1131.School progress (Average/Below/Drop Out)36.Substance abuse issues (Yes/no)37.Sexually active (Yes/no); Using birth control concerns (Yes/no) Souke: Cliik1 Health 2000 Systems De% clopment Initiative, Bureau ot Family and Community Health,Massachusetts Department of Public Ilcalth (1994).

Currently, states can count on using survey data On a regular basis from the census, theCurrent Population Survey, and the school-based Youth Risk Behavior Survey. These data sourcesinclude information on sociodemographic variables and youth risk behaviors; however, survey infor-mation on service utilization variables and insurance status is not available to states on a regularbasis unless the state or local area conducts a survey. The vital statistics birth and death registration systems provide population-based information tostate and local communities annually. Although these systems have been used effectively in manystates for planning and monitoring of health status, in some states there are still major barriers toproviding quality information in a timely fashion to all localities within the state. In addition, theinformation does not address child health issues beyond the neonatal period. Surveillance systems and disease registries potentially can be used effectively in planning and inmonitoring child health issues. lb date, however, these systems have been used primarily for plan-ning and evaluation in a categorical fashion (focusing on one health problem rather than becomingpart of an ongoing integrated child health data system used to plan and monitor child health ser-vices). In these surveillance systems, as in vital statistics systems, the quality and timeliness of datareporting greatly depends on the resources available within state and local areas. Finally, program and service management information systems provide another potential source ofinformation about child health and primary care within communities and states. Unfortunately,these systems are rarely population-based and reflect only the outcomes of children in a particularprogram or system. Although this type of information is often very useful, generalizations from thedata to larger population groups are very difficult. An example from current Massachusetts initiatives may help to illustrate the type of population-based system that is needed and is being developed through the Massachusetts Community HealthInformation Project (MassCH1P). The overall purpose of MassCH IP is to develop a database for needs assessment, planning of services, deployment of resources, program evaluation, and monitor-ing of health status in the Commonwealth. Initially funded through the federal Maternal and ChildHealth Bureau with Title V funds, MassCHIP will incorporate a wide array of state- and community-level data into a single, comprehensive database system. MassCHIP's menu-driven relational databasemanagement system will facilitate numerous types of queries about the data (e.g., by using clustersof geographic areas and varying breakdowns of demographic variables) and will access new data setsand updated data as they become available. The initial MassCHIP database includes a wide array of health indicators and service utilization datafrom the 1990 census, vital records and statistics, the Massachusetts Behavioral Risk FactorSurveillance System, uniform hospital discharge data, and the Massachusetts cancer registry. Thedatabase also includes program and service utilization datafrom Title V programs; data from other public health reg-istries or programs related to targeted health indicatorssuch as immunizations, lead poisoning, substance abuse,communicable diseases (HIV/AIDS, sexually tuberculosis, vaccine-preventable diseases); anddata from other public agency databases, such as data onMedicaid enrollment, child abuse cases, and unemployment. The real potential of MassCHIP will be fulfilled in the futureif patient outcome data for the entire primary care system,regardless of payor or type of arrangement, are added to thesystem.

MassCH IP provides a model for a population-based data system that can be used to carry ou the core functions of public health for all maternaland child primary health care. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS Although a number of data sources are currently available at national, state, and local levels, there aresignificant gaps in the data collected at each level and in the coordination of these population-basedsources. Because of these gaps, very little population-based data are available for local and state plan-ning of child health systems. Implementation of an integrated population-based MCH data systemfor use at local and state levels is possible by enhancing and expanding current data sources. The following set of recommendations would move the nation toward a population-based childhealth data system that could be used at local and state levels. These recommendations address twoissues: () additions to current data sources, and (2) data system development initiatives. Recommendations for enhancing current data sources: I.Ensure that each state has an automated birth and death vital statistics system thatproduces timely and quality data.2.Add a health services utilization section to the current school-based Youth RiskBehavior Survey.3.Institute a state-level survey similar to the National Health Interview Survey, withthe Child Health Supplement and the Youth Risk Behavior Survey conducted at leastevery five years or on a rolling basis, so that estimates can be generated in a timelyfashion.4.Develop and implement a national entry-to-kindergarten data registration system.3.Ensure that race and ethnicity data are collected in a standardized way in all local,state, and federal data collection activities.6.Ensure that each state has an efficient surveillance system or disease registry, suchas a cancer registry or a registry of birth defects, for all health issues. (Althoughmore than half of the states currently have such systems, many states still do not.)7.Ensure that e-codes (injury codes) are incorporated in all hospital discharge data. 61Q ') Recommendations for development of data systems to link various data sources: 1.Fund state and local systems to link maternal and child health surveillance andother current population-based data sources.2.Fund state and local data systems to monitor child health outcomes in primary carearrangements across all payers and communities.3.Fund initiatives to integrate all child health data sources from surveillance systems,program and service systems, primary care providers, and other s'ources into acommunity-based, consumer-friendly \"child health report card:'The cost of each set of recommendations should be determined and included in health care reformlegislation at the state and national levels. Without development of a basic MCH population-baseddata system that operates at all levels of government and serves both consumers and providers, assess-ing child health status and monitoring the impact of health care systems will remain compromised. 629 3 REFERENCES 1.Institute of Medicine. 1988.1he Future of Public Health.

The traditional schism between the public and private sectors in providing personal health ser- vices has led to extraordinary fragmentation of services, particularly with regard to the artificial sep-aration of preventive and curative care. Primary care services that provide ongoing preventive careover time with coordinated access to a comprehensive range of services delivered within culturallycompetent and family-centered environments are a priority in the era of health care reform. This new thrust will direct the provision of services away from specialists toward primary care practitioners as the \"hub\" or \"manager\" of the health care of populations. Charlyn E. Cassady, Ph.D. As states assume greater responsibility and accountability for services within their jurisdictions, theywill need tools and procedures, including periodic health status surveys, to assess the health status ofcommunities and to monitor change over time, with special attention to geographic areas and sub-populations at special risk for poor health and/or receipt of inadequate services. Monitoring the qual-ity of primary care will be an essential component in state assurance functions. Information will beneeded to guide states in uncovering gaps in services, justifying changes in fuoding allocations, andidentifying potential linkages among providers, resources, and services. Up to the present, the underdevelopment of a system of primary care has resulted in millions of chil-dren lacking access to comprehensive services. As a result, emergency room use for preventable con-ditions is high and the immunization rates for U.S. children are appallingly low. To avoid continuationof such deplorable phenomena, methods of measuring access to and quality of primary care receivedby children and of determining the primary care characteristics of various types of health careproviders are critically needed. While some large data sets can be used to demonstrate certain broad-scale needs of specific popula-tions, these data provide a predominantly retrospective and relatively limited view. Strobinoi andKlerman and Rosenbach2 exhaustively described the uses and limitations of large data sets, includ-ing hospital discharge data, vital statistics, and registries. More refined and specifk methods andinstrumcnts are needed to document access to services and utilization practices and to provide evi-dence of emerging needs. Special surveys, used as adjuncts to large data sets, can increase the valid-ity and reliability of information used for planning and resource allocation decisions. MEASUREMENT OF ATTRIBUTES OF PRIMARY CARE Supported by the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, The Johns Hopkins University Child andAdolescent Health Policy Center (CAH PC) is developing methods for measurilig the attributes of pri-mary care for children. This work includes the development of severa l. instruments designed todescribe the characteristics of primary care provided to populations of children. 'Fools such as these 66 will help states to identify areas of high need for new services, availability of state and communityresources, and changes in service utilization. Development of the measurement instruments is based on the framework of primary care developedby Dr. Barbara Starlield3 and further explicated in Analysis of the Concept of Primary Care jOrChildren and Adolescents, prepared by The John HopkinsUniversity Child and Adolescent Health Policy Center.-IThis framework comprises seven attributes of primarycare: first-contact, longitudinality, comprehensiveness,coordination, community oriented, culturally compe-tent, and family centered. Early work in conceptualizingprimary care and systems of health care demonstratedthat information from a variety of perspectives would heneeded to conduct a thorough assessment of primaryAssessment tools would need tobe designed to study the systemfrom four perspectivesthestate or agency, the community,the facility or provider, and theclient or consumer. care for children within a population. Assessment tools would need to be designed to study the sys-tem from four perspectivesthe state or agency, the community, the facility or provider, and theclient or consumer.The following sections of this paper describe both the experiences with specific states as they use theattribute framework for strategic planning, and the development and testing of instruments to assessprimary care from the tbur perspectives. USE OF THE ATTRIBUTES IN STRATEGIC PLANNING: ARIZONA The Child and Adolescent Health Policy Center framework of primary care was used by the state ofArizona in developing a strategic plan to improve the system of primary care for children in the state.In 1988, the Arizona Department of Ilealth Services conducted a statewide survey of health care uti-liiation.' The findings documented the relatively low level of preventive services being received and 67 the fact that many Arizona families did not have a medical home. In July 1992, the Office of Women'sand Children's Health in the Department of Health Services convened the Arizona Children's PrimaryHealth Care Task Force, charged with developina comprehensive plan that would ensure access toprimary health care services for all children from birth to age 21. Four objectives were delineated for the task force: (I) Define the attributes or characteristics of pri-mary care, (2) determine the criteria for measuring these attributes at both state and local levels,(3) determine how effectively Arizona was implementing these attributes, and (4) develop strategiesto improve the system of services. The task force working groups were staffed with central office per-sonnel and a graduate intern from the Department of Maternal and Child Health at The JohnsHopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health. The task force worked to develop consensus on key terms for planning such as \"systems develop-ment,\" \"medical home,\" and \"primary care.\" Working groups were then formed to determine(1) appropriate roles and responsibilities within a primary health care system, and (2) appropriatepolicies needed to promote and facilitate a health care home for children and adolescents. Startle ld'sHealth Services System model was then used as the framework to delineate recommendations forsystem structure and processes (see page 17). Using an early draft of the Facility/Provider Primary Care Assessment Tool provided by the Child andAdolescent Health Policy Center, a third working group of the task force developed system perfor-mance measures for each attribute of primary care. For each attribute, the group determined a \"goldstandard\" and community-level self-assessment questions. Figure I illustrates an example of theArizona approach using the attribute \"first-contact care.\" Planning activities for the implementationphase, which included an in-depth analysis of current system performance, were undertaken in 1993. This analysis focused on identifying statewide organizational and programmatic policies and proce-dures influencing access to primary care. This process identified several successful and innovative 68 Figure 1 Example of Primary Care System Performance MeasuresDeveloped by the Arizona Task Force \"First-Contact Care\"Concept: \"First-contact care\" refers to the primary care provider being responsible for facilitatingentry into the health care system Ifor each nonreferred provision of health care and guiding theclient to the most appropriate source of care]. Gold Standard: A system of primary care is established in which the primary care provider is con-tacted for all health care needs so that an informed judgment is made and guidance is given regard-ing the most appropriate source of care.Community-Level Self-Assessment Questions:1.What mechanisms are in place to encourage individuals/families in the community to contacta health care home for all nonreferred health services? Are these mechanisms documented sothat trackable data are available for review? 2.What mechanisms are in place to establish the linkages between the individuals/families andthe primary care providers?

However, task force members also identified system inequities through-out Arizona with respect to several \"structural\" characteristics. Gaps identified in the system include: Poor distribution and supply Of primary care providers as Well as providers under therizona Health Care Cost Containment System (the state Medicaid program), especiallyin rural areasthere were 32 federally designated Ilealth Manpower Shortage Areasand 21 federally designated Medically Underserved Areas in the state in 1990.\" BEST COPY AVAILABLE 69 -..,,Inadequate use of facilities in underserved areas due to different service eligibilitiesfor example, the Indian Health Service can serve only Native Americans even whenother populations live in surrounding areas.7 .-----Unmet need for linguistically and culturally competent providers especially in predomi-nantly Native American and Hispanic communitiestask force members. recognizedthat the unique cultural composition of Arizona, which includes large populations ofNative Americans and Mexican Americans, creates special issues with respect to pro-viding care and receiving care.8 Staff in Arizona reported that the CAHPC framework of primary care helped significantly in identify-ing multiple gaps and insufficiencies in the current system of primary health care services in thestate. In addition, the gold standard and self-assessment questions developed through analyzing eachof the primary care attributes have provided a sound basis for subsequent activities resulting fromthe task force planning effort. These activities include various community development projects inwhich the state maternal and child health (MCH) program becomes a partner with the ArizonaChapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, private hospitals, universities, and school districts,among others. This experience emphasizes that using a framework to assess the health services sys-tem is essential for organizing system components into a context in which they can be understood. STATE AND COMMUNITY ASSESSMENT OF ORGANIZATIONALPRACTICES: PENNSYLVANIA, ARIZONA, AND ALABAMA The state or agency perspective assesses the views and practices of the agencies and programs thatdeliver and/or assure that primary care services and social support services are available to childrenand their families. To collect information at the state level, key health policymakers, program plan-ners, and administrators in Pennsylvania were interviewed, using an open-ended, structured inter-view guide. The approach was not quantitative, but was designed to provide indications of areasneeding further assessment. 70100 Items exploring the domain of first-contact care addressed information that may be symptomatic ofa lack of access to primary care services (such as high use of emergency rooms for primary care con-ditions), the existence of mechanisnm to achieve a better distribution of primary care providersacross the state, and information on practices to assure that specific populations are receiving pri-mary care services. Longitudinality items exploied how families were being encouraged to adopt aregular source of care and described efforts to reduce barriers or provide incentives to receive carefrom thesame provider over time.The attribute of comprehensiveness was addressed by determining whether the state or relevantagency had specified or recommended a prescribed, or minimum, level of services, and by determin-ing the availability of other primary care-related and support services throughout the state. Finally,the attribute of coordination was assessed by examining efforts to develop tracking systems at thestate level to monitor health and health services utilization, and by identifying procedures to make iteasier to determine eligibility and to link children and families in need with available programs andservices. State agency and program directors reported that the interview process increased their awareness ofthe vital aspects of primary care and the importance of monitoring the quality of primary care. Pilottesting of this interview format demonstrated t1' ,t an enormous amount of information on currentorganization and past initiatives could be gathered. This method also has the potential to identifyduplicative programs and initiatives across different agencies. The Child and Adolescent Health Policy Center has also used the primary care framework to con-struct a self-assessment guide to assist communities in examining the status of current local activi-ties undertaken to promote a system of primary care for children and adolescents. The guide can beused by community organizations and agencies (such as task forces, advisory boards, local healthdepartments) to begin a self-assessment for community-based planning. The intent of the guide is tohelp organize available information and target areas in need of further data on health serviceresources ,md public health activities at the community level. 71 The Arizona MCH program has fielded the self-assessment guide in two areas of Phoenix andrucson, and now requires applicants for primary care planning grants to complete the self-assess-ment guide as part of the application process. In addition, Alabama has used the guide (with someadaptations) in all 67 counties within the state os a component of the Title V program's statewideneeds assessment. The self-assessment guide will undergo refinement based on evaluation of its usein Alabama and Arizona. ASSESSMENT OF PROVIDER OR FACILITIES PRACTICES:DELAWARE, DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, AND WEST VIRGINIA Early versions of the Facility/Provider Survey were pilot tested in Delaware, the District of Columbia,and West Virginia with the goal of producing data regarding how well primary care attributes werebeing addressed in a variety of health care settings. As implemented in Delaware, the tool wasdesigned in an open-ended interview format to allow the CAFIPC to explore the Delaware responders'understandings of the concept of primary care and subsequently to construct potential items to heused in multiple-choice categories in future versions. In this survey instrument, the attribute of first-contact was assessed through questions concerning the methods used to increase accessibility andavailability of services, and mechanisms for obtaining care for families unable to afford care.Longitudinality was a3certained by determining how providers encourage individuals to return totheir facility and by determining the percentage of individuals using the facility for both preventiveand illness care. An assessment of the comprehensiveness of services used a checklist to note specific services offeredon-site, the source of written standards used, and identification of unmet needs of children and fam-ilies seen in the practice. For the items addressing the achievement of coordination, responders wereasked to identify methods used to assist clients in seeking support services and to assure that infor-mation from referral visits is incorporated into an ongoing plan of care. 72J In determining the level of community-oriented care, the survey asked responders to identify themajor health-related characteristics of the community, and to indicate whether they participate incommunity diagnosis, health surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation. Items addressing culturallycompetent care asked responders to identify the activities being used to reach culturally diverse pop-ulations (such as mechanisms to represent views of these groups in decisions involving policies, pri-orities, and plans related to the delivery of services). To assess the provision of family-centered care,items addressed the formal and informal opportunities for families to participate in the developmentof family-centered services and for taking into account the role of the family in the genesis of illhealth as well as the response to medical interventions. At the direction of the Delaware Division of Public Health, 121 providers and facilities were selectedfor a sample; 82 of these providers were interviewed in person. The sample included a variety ofprovider sites such as community and migrant health centers, school-based wellness centers, familyphysicians, pediatricians, and hospital-based primary care clinics. The other major category was des-ignated adjunct health care providers (those providing services mainly to support primary care, suchas mental health care and substance abuse treatment and counseling services). Analysis of the information collected from the interviews indicated distinct strengths in the existingprimary care system as well as specific areas for improvement. For example, the \"one-stop shopping\"approach used to organize services at community centers offered a viable solution to the transporta-tion and scheduling barriers experienced by many families. Representation on community advisoryboardsreported by 100 percent of the community health centers and school wellness centers, 86percent of the public health units, 60 percent of the hospital primary care clinics, and 44 percent ofthe private physicians in Delawarewas determined to be another area of strength. Areas that wereperceived as needing improvement included the lack of 24-hour medical coverage for clients usingpublic health clinics, the lack of knowledge among families about how to access and use the healthcare system, and poor access to dental care and mental health and psychological services. 7 3C' '3 A second version of the Facility/Provider Survey was pilot tested in the District of Columbia, usingproviders and facilities selected randomly from mailing lists provided by the D.C. Commission ofPublic I lealth. The attributes of primary care were measuned using the same concepts as in the previ-mis pilot studies. The survey was predonnnantly an open-ended format, with examples provided forclarification and ample space for additional comments. Responders received a packet in the mail thatincluded a full explanation of the survey and a concise narrative on the attributes of primary care. In the District of Columbia pilot test, the response rate was only 14 percent. Of the total number ofresponders (X = 61), 97 percent were private, for-profit providers, and 3 percent were public, not-for-profit providers. The site of practice was predominantly solo or group practice (39 percent), with thetwo major practice area designated as pediatrics (56 percent)Early pilot studies indicatedthe value of developingresponse options using bothopen-ended responses andsuggestions from reviewersin the field.and general practice or family practice (18 percent). In early 1993, the West Virginia MCH program used a multi-ple choice version of the instrument to survey all providerswho might be involved in providing health care to children inthe state. Approximately 900 surveys were mailed: 203 topediatricians, 525 to family physicians, 31 to osteopathicphysicians, 82 to community health centers, and 53 to localhealth departments. With one mailing, an overall response rate of about 20 percent was achieved; 65percent of responders were pediatricians or family practitioners, 16 percent were community healthcenters, and about 18 percent were local health departments. This survey, like the surveys described above, addressed seven attributes of primary care. Data pro-vided the basis for several specific recommendations for program planning. Most notable was theapparent fragmentation of services, with neither private nor public sectors strong in all primary careattributes. The public health arena showed evidence of a high level of knowledge about community 74104 problems, available resources, and interventions. It also offered linkages with enhanced and enablingservices. Recommendations to the state included exploring opportunities for bringing the comple-mentary strengths of the different provider sectors together to develop a more coordinated and effi-cient approach to providing services. ASSESSMENT OF THE CONSUMER OR CLIENT PERSPECTIVE:DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA A third area of study was initiated to test an instrument designed to measure access to and quality ofprinlary care received by children. Responses to the items could also be used to determine the rela-tionship between the type of source of care and the primary care orientation of that source. Whenused in a parallel study of the primary care providers identified by the consumer group, the relation-ship between the family's perceptions of their child's care and the provider's perception of that carecan be ascertained. This information will be useful to planners in their efforts to identify and orga-nize services that better meet the needs of specific populations. ftc Consumer/Client Survey is being tested during 1994-95 in a telephone survey of 450 householdsin a specified area of the District of Columbia. From the outset, this instrument is being constructedaccording to psychometric principles. Each of the attributes of primary care will be assessed along ascale that will have known internal consistency, reliability, and validity. The attribute of first-contact is represented by a scale including items developed to measure the levelof accessibility and availability of primary care services, satisfaction with various aspects of first-contact, and characteristics of the site of primary care. I,ongitudinality is assessed by determiningthe consistency with which the same provider is seen at visits for difkrent health care needs, by thetypes and locale of services received in the past year, and by the nature of the relationship between 75 provider and patient. Comprehensiveness is determined by assessing the range of services availableat the site of primary care, and the types of topic areas discussed during visits, including child safetyand developmental changes. The extent of coordination is determined by the nature of communication between primary careproviders and specialists, assistance received in accessing specialty services, and actions to help fam-ilies understand and carry out recommendations from the referral visits. In addition to assessingthese unique features of primary care, the survey also assesses family centeredness, community ori-entation, and cultural competency by means of other questions designed to provide scale scores sim-ilar to those for the other attributes. Interviewers recruited by the MCH program in the District of Columbia participated in a two-daytraining workshop on the use of the tool and telephone survey techniques. The telephone list used toconstitute the sample contained randomly chosen numbers (75 percent) and also listed numbers (25percent) within the survey area. The telephone interview requires less than 25 minutes for completion, including time allowed torecord additional comments offered by the responder. Interviewers report a high level of interest anda willingness to participate when households with children are contacted. The need to study issues of primary health care for children fn. 3 the viewpoint of facility or providerwas considered the next logical step in collecting the information required to guide the improvementof RC.'s current \"ystem of care.\" Thus, the second phase of the project will use a newly developedinstrument in a mail survey of the providers of primary care identified by responders of the house-hold survey. Mailing of the survey packets to identified providers is projected for early 1995. TheKaiser Family Foundation will fund psychometric testing of both the Consumer/Client Thol and theFacility/Provider Thol. CONCLUDING THOUGHTS Each experience in using the instruments has provided valuable lessons that have been incorporatedinto further work on primary care assessment. Early pilot studies indicated the value of developingresponse options using both responses from open-ended versions of the survey and suggestions fromreviewers in the field. Review by experts is a critical step used by the study team to develop an instru-ment that is considered both useful by researchers and pertinent by responders. Pretest administra-tion has indicated onsiderable face validity for the instruments, which are currently being revisedfor future administration in different localities. The pilot studies also increased the study team's concern about the issue of low response with mailedsurveys. Creativity in offering incentives for participation and enhancing interest is indicated in thistype of study. The use of in-person interviews requires a significant investment in time and staffingresources. This approach, however, reduces the limitations of nonresponse often encountered inmailed surveys. Several other strategies have been identified to increase response rates, includingsmall monetary gratuities to encourage participation, and collabohltion with professional organiza-tions to include letters of support and advocacy for the survey project. This description of recent experiences in developing methods for assessing primary care for childrenhas indicated the tremendous interest among states and localities in undertaking new roles of sys-tems developm'ent, accountability, and assurance. Despite the current emphasis on managed care as apossible solution to problems of excess costs and poor primary care, questions about quality of care,health outcomes, or user satisfaction still remain.9 States and local jurisdictions are approachingassessment and improvement of primary care as critical tasks for improving the health care of chil-dren. The Child and Adolescent Health Policy Center will continue to develop and test instruments toassist health care providers and policymakers to collect the information required for rational deci-sion making and sound planning efforts as health care reform evolves. 77 REFERENCES 1.Strobino D. for ard Adofesicots Poi,cfescorch Brief.

In New York City, for example, urban health centers serve the residents of China Town, the bar-rios of the Bronx, and Brooklyn's Hasidic communityeach presenting different health challengesand requiring individual solutions. Rural centers also meet diverse challenges. A rural center in theDakotas with fewer than six people per square mile presents a different set of community and healthissues than an isolated rural center in West Virginia nestled in the valley where most of the communitylives and works. Health centers that serve migrant and seasonal farm workei.s are beacons for farm-workers harvesting the nation's crops in western, midwestern, and eastern migrant streams. In fact, Bureau of Primary Health Care programs serve a richly textured nation distinguished by pop-ulations of many cultures. Client populations reflect this diversity: 27 percent are African American,29 percent Hispanic, 2 percent Asian, 38 percent white, I percent Native American, and 3 percentother ethnic or racial groups. Sixty-one percent of these persons have incomes below the federalpoverty level and are underinsured; 38 percent have no health insurance. lb meet the needs of such diverse and low-income communities, community and migrant healthcenters must first demonstrate the need for services through a community assessment. By law, thecenters must reassess community and user needs periodically, necessitating an assessment of theavailability of community resources to meet those needs. Most important, community and migranthealth centers are expected to work together with other organizations in the community's health careand social service delivery system to address the needs of populations using these programs. Many of the Bureau of Primary Health Care's activities relate to the assessment and development ofpreventive and primary care services for children and youth. By going \"where the kids are school-based health centers surmount a major barrier to health care access, particularly for adolescents. Through a joint grant program with the Maternal and Child Health Bureau, the Bureau of PrimaryIlealth Care has also developed Healthy Schools, Healthy Communities, a comprehensive primaryhealth services program for children and youth that includes a full range of primary care services, including mental health and social service programs and referral for specialty services such as sub-stance abuse treatment. This program targets homeless children and other children who are at highrisk for poor health, school failure, homelessness, and other consequences of poverty. It marks thefirst time that direct categorical funding has been made available for school-based services in BPHC-funded programs.Additionally, several of the community and migrant health centers incorporate a pilot implementa-tion project, Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS), developed by the AmericanMedical Association. GAPS provides systematically developed recommendations for delivering com-prehensive adolescent clinical preventive services. The recommendations guide primary careproviders in treating physical disease and the medical consequences of adolescent health risk behav-iors, and in preventing or modifying these behaviors. GAPS emphasizes that adolescent health caredelivery depends on a partnership among parents, adolescents, and primary care providers workingtogether for health promotion and disease prevention. PARAMETERS OF PRIMARY CARE PLANNING Using a community-oriented primary care approach, community and migrant health centers delivercomprehensive, family-centered primary care services in all five life cycles (perinatal, pediatric, ado-lescent, adult, and geriatric). Building effective preventive and primary care delivery systems withinthis model demands: Identifying and defining the target population (e.g., young children and adolescents);Assessing the state of health of the population and the factors that have contributedto health status;Locating resources within the community to help address recognized health problems;Deciding what can realistically be accomplished;Implementing and managing delivery systems in response to the identified needs; andEvaluating the intervention. State-based planning is accomplished through BPHC-funded state and regional primary careassociations and through cooperative agreements with state health agencies. These associations andagencies assist organizations within their states and regions in development and delivery of compre-hensive primary health care service in areas lacking adequate health professionals or among popula-tions lacking access to primary.care services. In cooperation with the U.S. Department of Education, the Bureau of Primary Health Care is identify-ing communities served by both Chapter I schools and by community and migrant health centers.When these schools exist in commtmities served by community and migrant health centers, the plancalls for (1) bringing the school and health center together for planning, (2) suggesting cooperativeinitiatives in primary care and health promotion for children and youth, and (3) providing examplesof joint planning and implementation activities that succeeded in other areas. QUALITY IMPROVEMENT Inherent in the concept of evaluation is the perception of quality. Quality is defined by how well theneeds of communities and users are met, by the expectations of the purchasers of care, and bynationally accepted guidelines or standards. For health centers, this operational definition of qualityis embedded in the program expectations.Program ExpectationsThe initial step of the journey toward quality of care involves defining expectations for an efficientlymanaged health center that provides quality care. Our expectations are based not only on the lawsand regulations governing our pi:ograms, but also on the more elusive factors such as identifying anddescribing the key elements in an effective and successful preventive and primary care program,regardless of government mandate. To accomplish this task, clinical and administrative representa-tives from health centers met with their counterparts in the Bureau of Primary Health Care todevelop Program Expectations for Community and Migrant Health Centers, a document that repre- 82 sents a consensus of what we mean by a successful, high-quality health center that responds to theneeds of its community.Program Expectations for Community and Migrant Health Centers comprises four major sections:needs assessment and planning, governance, management and finance, and the clinical program.Each section, in turn, contains a core set of expectations followed by necessary explication. Theseprogram expectations form the bedrock of the Bureau ofPrimary Health Care programs and arc the source of allBPHC policiesincluding the Primary Care EffectivenessReview (the instrument used during site review of all BPHCprograms every five years).Primary Care Effectiveness ReviewLike Program Expectations for Community and MigrantHealth Centers, the site review instrument was developedwith an interdisciplinary team of grantees after close studyof related review instruments developed by the JointCommission on the Accreditation of Hospital Organizations,the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set, and theInherent in the concept ofevaluation is the perceptionof quality. Quality is definedby how well the needs ofcommunities and users aremet, by the expectations ofthe purchasers of care, andby nationally acceptedguidelines or standards. Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care. The objectives of the Primary CareEffectiveness Review are to ( ) serve as a self-assessment tool, (2) facilitate consultation, (3) recognizestrengths that serve as models for others, (4) identify weaknesses that can be improved through tech-nical assistance or training, and (5) monitor the program. Although the review instrument is not anaccreditation tool, it is helpful for organizations preparing for accreditation.The review teams consist of both federal and nonfederal professionals. Most of the nonfederalreviewers are from health centers in other regions of the country, thus facilitating consultation andbalance. In addition, all reviewers (federal and nonfederal) must participate in an ongoing trainingprogram for reviewers. 83 The Primary Care Effectiveness Review is a dynamic instrument. Each year, an interdisciplinarygroup critiques it, assesses the need for change, and revises it accordingly. This 1994 revision focusedon new legislative mandates such as case management, lead screening, and key health care develop-ments such as managed care. This year's revision also included a critique and revision of questions,and, most importantly, integration of all Bureau of Primary Health Care service programs into onereview document. This means that practices receiving Bureau of Primary Health Care funds for morethan one program need only one integrated, comprehensive review. It also means that specific pro-grams such as HIV programs and Health Care for the Homeless review overall primary care issuesand that primary care practices, even if they receive no special funding, have the opportunity toreview how their practices manage HIV and issues important to homeless families. The Primary Care Effectiveness Review is based on Program Expectations for Community andMigrant Health Centers and is similar in organizational content, with major sections on administra-tion, governance, clinical issues, fiscal systems, and management information systems. The clinicalsection focuses on policies and procedures, clinical systems, and clinical services. Notably, all of thesections are interrelated; for example, the results of patient surveys (assessed in the administrativeand governance section) are important far clinical care as well as for quality fiscal systems. Major portions of the clinical section focus on clinical protocols for treatment of common, acute, andchronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, HIV, otitis media) in the population served. Medicalrecords are then reviewed to assess use of these protocols by all providers. Additionally, medicalrecords are reviewed for evidence of preventive services. In the pediatric life cycle, records arereviewed to determine use of preventive health schedules and ,strategies that include anticipatoryguidance, growm and development assessment, lead screening, immunization schedules, injury pre-vention, and oral disease prevention. Records in the adolescent life cycle are reviewed for family plan-ning counseling, immunization schedules, and behavioral risk assessment including diet, exercise,reproductive health, and prevention of sexually transmitted diseases and substance abuse. It isimportant to note that issues such as confidentiality for adolescents are assessed, as well as strategiesused by the practice to identify and manage domestic violence and abuse. Since each program receives a site visit at least once every five years and about four months beforethe grant application is due, issues are identified early enough to develop a technical assistance planto incorporate into the grant application. This approach also means that review of the application isbased not on a paper review but on a recent on-site assessment of the practice. After completing over300 of these reviews as of May 1994, both the BPHC and the grantees think that the Primary CareEffectiveness Review represents a fair balance between monitoring and consultation. In fact, about 25percent of these reviews have led to requests for some type of technical assistance from BPFIC; thisdoes not include grantees who may have sought additional help on their own. CLINICAL MEASURES Historically, the health center program had a series of clinical reporting requirements that includedimmunizations, anemia screening, family planning counseling, hypertension, and follow-up forabnormal Pap tests. Each reporting requirement was based on a medical record review and each hada threshold. For example, the immunization threshold was 90 percent compliance and the standardfor follow-up of abnormal Pap tests was 100 percent. Programs that did not meet this threshold expe-rienced consequences affecting their grant funding. In early 1989, an interdisciplinary group of clinicians and executive directors from health centers metwith federal representatives to begin a comprehensive revision of the clinical reporting requirements.For each major life cycle, the group developed a set of measures that were useful both for clinicalmanagement and for improvement of community health. These clinical measures include bothprocess and outcome criteria. The group also reached consensus that clinical outcome measures should: Reflect guidelines of professional groups and the Healthy People 2000objectives;Focus on process and intermediate outcome measures; ;85 -,Focus on critical primary care interventions;Use the life cycle approach;Be acceptable to clinicians and communities;Be measurable and realistic; andComplement other national health initiatives such as immunization efforts. In addition to these criteria, the following major assumptions were made: Measures are based on community and migrant health center protocols;Phase-in time should be included, with opportunities for training and assistance;Measures should be linked to community and migrant health center planning andquality improvement activities;Measures are user-based, with clinical records as the data source;Measures are only indicators, complementing the site review;Measures must be viewed within socioeconomic and cultural contexts; andHealth care provision is still an artthere are many unknowns.After a comprehensive review of the literature and several work group meetings, the measures weredeveloped and implemented. Since children and adolescents are the focus of this forum, only thepediatric and adolescent life cycles will be addressed. The pediatric life cycle includes assessment for: Immunization of infants and children;Assessment and management of growth and development problems (growth chartand anemia screen; developmental milestone assessment including gross motor,fine motor, language, and social development); andBaby bottle tooth decay prevention counseling (if water supply is not fluoridated). The adolescent life cycle assessment includes: Behavioral risk assessment for substance abuse (including tobacco) in adolescentsand in their sexual partners and families; and 86116 Documented family planning counseling that includes information about preven-tion of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. _Clinical Measures: Management PhilosophyAfter a set of measures was established, the next step was to replace the outmoded threshold-punishment approach with a self-management orientation. Consequently, health centers conduct abaseline assessment of these measures and then set a three-year goal. They report their progresstoward this goal and request technical assistance if needed. Most important, funding decisions arenot based on the baseline measures or the actual goals. Instead, progress toward meeting the healthcenter-generated goals is documented and discussed in yearly progress reports and during the on-site review. In addition to demanding a more comprehensive look at a specific clinical practice, the clinical mea-sures program also helps tobring health center clinician's together to work collaboratively. Cliniciansin several states and regions took the initiative to work together on these measures through theirregional or state primary care associations. The Bureau of Primary Health Care supported and encour-aged this development not only because is it an effective way to implement the initiative, but alsobecause such teamwork builds clinical excellence at the local level, where leadership in quality belongsand is most effective. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate how this works. These figures depict a state in which 19 community andmigrant health centers are participating in a clinical measures pilot project. In 1993, the centersreported their baseline data around the various measures, and set three-year goals based on thesedata. Baseline data and yearly progress toward the goals are reported to the network, which reports tothe Bureau of Primary Health Care without identifiers. Figure 1 shows baseline levels of compliancefor growth and development goals for the pediatric life cycle. Figure 2 indicates baseline compliancelevels for assessment of sexual activity during the adolescent life cycle. After establishing these base-lines, the centers work together through the network to develop protocols and practice-based strate-gies for improving baseline levels. 87# Figure I-Baseline Clinical Measures Growth and Development ua &Al Clinically Useful vs. Statistically SignificantSince the clinical measures program is still in development, it is important to understand that thedata are not yet statistically significant. Clearly, random review of even a limited number of records(especially in programs where no medical records are in compliance) can contribute to better care. Inaddition, the systematic revision of protocols and clinical systems that can result from a limitedreview is also useful. However, a larger number of charts must be reviewed to achieve statistical sig-nificance; on average, 20 medical records were reviewed for growth and development and 26 werereviewed for assessment of adolescent sexual activity. Therefore, the variations noted in the differenttables indicates a general idea of some trends, but may or may not be statistically significant. h8 Figure 2-Baieline Clinical 1376 - 16 17 la StAIN 3446 It is also noteworthy that centers were committed to the mission of quality improvement and consid-ered themselves members of a team of health centers. Consequently, they did not hesitate to report,even when no medical records (or a very low percentage) were in compliance. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate baseline and first-year trend data for both the growth and development andthe sexual activity measures. In general, it appears that both high baselines and gains are r-ore diffi-cult to achieve in the care of adolescents than in the growth and development measure for infantsand children. Most of the percentages that are within 20-25 points probably represent variation;however, a number of centers exhibited gains of 50 percent or more. 89 Figure 3-Clinical Measures Growth and Development z6.4x0C.7tz.0 g100 80 7167-no data 76 \"7o 12314567910111213141618St.A$1 REALM CENTERS Clinical Measures and Community-Oriented Primary CareIn addition to improving the care of individual patients, the clinical measures also complement thecommunity-oriented primary care approach to community health. The clinical measures help toidentify health issues in the target population. The following is an example from a health centerlocated in a frontier area. Based on the clinical measure for substance abuse, a study of adolescents was conducted using theRAITT questionnaire for alcohol abuse (see figure 3). Seventy-eight adolescents were screened as 90 Figure 4-Clinical Measures Sexual Activity 5<: ra0Q0I;;la tdL)cma.1 0 0 80 60 40 20 0Baseline 0 Fit.St Year 84 72 62IIII6780 62 44i9285 1161100Centers8 15 615\u00b013221no 62 2% LsII\"123456791011 HEALTH CENTERS1213141617 18 &Avg part of routine athletic health assessments. The investigator was very skeptical that teens wouldanswer the questions honestly and felt he would he wasting his time and perhaps alienating the ado-lescents in his practice. Instead, he tOund that teens answered his questions readily. The prevalence ofsubstance abuse among these adolescents is highas illustrated in Figure 5, with two-thirds of theadolescents responding\"yes\" to one or more of the questions. The results also indicated that teens with a family history of substance abuse are more likely to havetwo or more \"yes\" answers and that teens have twice the risk of being in trouble if a family member BEST COPY AVAILABLE91 _Figure is an acronym for a screeningquestionnaire Do you drink or use drugs to Reiax,feel better about yourself, or to fit in?'Do you ever drink or use drugs whileyou are byrurself, Alone?Do you cir any of your close-Friendsdrink or use drugs?Does a dose Famifr member have aproblem with alcthol or drug use?Have youever gotten into Doublefrom drinking or drug use? has had problems with drugs or alcohol.

These findingsprofoundly influenced the study director's clinical practice, and have awakencd the community to aproblem. LESSONS LEARNED Following are some of the lessons learned, especially about the journey to quality in a preventive andprimary care delivery system for the underserved and in the context of a community-orientedapproach. Clinicians and staff are enthusiastic if they have: Early and continuous involvement;Continuous feedback from data;Autonomy to solve problems;Opportunities to collaborate;Opportunities for professional development and growth; andResources available to help them measure and interpret data.Issues concerning low-income and underserved populations: Standards of care are the same as for more affluent populations;Target population is highly mobile;Poverty is a primary determinant of health outcome;Potential exists to learn about community health status;Potential exists to improve community health status; and.,Potential exists to document quality for clients.Issues for primary care organizations to consider: Capacity and capability to collect and analyze data;Skills needed to improve clinical care;Need for networks of community/public health providers;Aid in bridging community/administrative/clinical cultures; andNeed to retain responsir,ility at the local level and to help develop local leadership tobuild and maintain quality. 93I 2 FUTURE DIRECTIONS Three major issues dominate the immediate future: Managed care, development and use of guide-lines, and reintegration of clinical practice with community and public health. With a population that is defined and identified, managed care has the potential for more effectivepreventive and primary care interventions. A managed care organization or network committed tocommunity-oriented primary care will view its members as \"members for life\" and will plan and'mplement effective health strategies. With such a defined population, assessment of need and healthstatus, effective use of resources, and measurement of impact remain complex, but are now possible. Access issues such as cultural and language harriers, literacy, and poverty remain, even with adefined group of members. This is especially true for underserved adolescents who are often difficultto find and reach, and for infants and children who depend upon adults for access to both preventiveand primary care. The managed care \"report card\" or Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) repre-sents the potential to help measure quality and access as long as indicators that affect health statusand indicators that measure cost-efkctiveness are chosen. In addition, if HEDIS is viewed only as a\"report card\" and not as one of many quality improvement tools, the journey toward quality couldbecome a maze devoted to \"looking good\" rather than improving the quality and impact of healthservices. The Bureau of Primary Health Care is enthusiastic about working with the National Committee forQuality Assurance and other committed agencies and organizations during the coming year to inte-grate the bureau's initiatives (such as the clinical measures) with the HEMS strategy. In fact, theNational Committee for Quality Assurance is now revising HEDIS, with the Public Health Serviceparticipating as a partner in this process. 94124 GuidelinesWith respect to developing and implementing guidelines, the Bureau of Primary Health Care willcontinue to consult with organizations developing guidelines and to test these standards in primarycare practices in underserved communities. These activities are now under way with the AmericanMedical Association's Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services, and the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention's Standards for Childhood Immunizations and hepatitis B guidelines. A simi-lar project is now in the planning stage for the Clinical Preventive Services Recommendations. In addition to measures, guidelines, and models, clinical practices need resources and expertise tomeasure outcomes in their practices and to use this information to improve practice and communityhealth impact. Partnerships, however, are crucial to carrying out such a strategy. The Bureau ofPrimary Health Care is developing models of partnerships between public health agencies, primarycare associations, networks of health center clinicians, and clinical practices in order to help busyhealth center staff review medical records, collect and share community health data, and provide prac-tices with tools needed to use information to improve quality. These partnerships are successful andeffective. One state, for example, provides a nurse whose responsibilities are dedicated to these vitalquality improvement activities, and this has led to successful implementation of the clinical measures. In conclusion, the importance of commitment must be emphasized. For people working in commu-nity and migrant health centers, in health care programs for the homeless, health care programs inpublic housing, and HIV programs, their work is more than a job. For many, work within the commu-nity health movement helps (along with family and community) to define meaning in their lives.Indeed, a sense of mission and a vision that embraces quality leads to improved health for the future.The planning, the measures, the data, and the technology are secondary. The Bureau of PrimaryHealth Care is committed to such a vision shared with partners in the communities we serve, thepeople who work to improve the health of underserved communities, and our sister and brotheragencies and organizations throughout the nation. 95 Community System Assessmentand Child Health Planning in Iowa INTRODUCTION Community primary care planning and development in Iowa arose from concerns about gaps,overlaps, and fragmentation within child health services. In Iowa, the community has beenidentified as the primary level for intervention; this decision was supported by several observations.The way things get done differs somewhat in each community. Variations arise from many factors,including resources, local history, and culture. At the local level, it is feasible to sort out and weigh theimpact of the factors contributing to problems in the local system of care. Collaborating state andfederal agencies facilitate and provide resources as localities initiate the process of system change. byCharles E. Danielson, M.D., M.P.H., Mary Anderson, M.A., and Kay Leeper, M.S.N. Primary care has many attributes that can be built upon to address the gaps, overlaps, and fragmen-tation in local health services. The terms \"family centered,\"\"coordinater\"first contact,\" and \"compre-hensive\" describe a powerful group of characteristics that, when appropriately applied, can exert apositive influence on the behavior of a local health system. In winter 1991, the Iowa Department of Public Health began working on the Healthy Foundationsproject, a five-year child health systems development grant supported by the federal Maternal andChild Health Bureau as part of the special projects of regional and national significance (SPRANS).Currently, Healthy Foundations includes 12 projects in 22 of Iowa's 99 counties. The HealthyFoundations project views community primary care enhancement as a leadership partnershipbetween state and local sites, in which issues originate at either level. Healthy Foundations has a con-tinuous quality improvement model for system improvement at the local level guided by a broadlybased community coalition. As communities identify, analyze, and improve their local systems ofcare, they carry out a plan-do-study-act feedback cycle. This paper presents our experiences andidentifies key themes that have influenced the success of communities in implementing systemchanges. The Healthy Foundations process has been refined over the three years of the project so that much ofthe community planning is now flexibly guided using a loose-leaf manual (considered a working andevolving document).1 New projects provide local matching funds of at least 20 percent and receive$5,000 from the state. The community process begins with an application to the Iowa Department ofPublic Health. The applicant describes the community, the organization, and the initial structure ofthe community coalition; identifies local resource contributions; and provides assurances that theHealthy Foundations process will be carried out. A local community coordinator works with community leaders and a Healthy Foundations state con-sultant to organize or build upon a community coalition. These community coalitions are the key-stones of local activity. Each community carries out a facilitated assessment of its child health needsfrom a primary care perspective, identifying and prioritizing areas for improvement. The community develops plans to address priority issues, identifies resources, and initiates interventions. Communitycoalitions continue to monitor the process and either begin new activities or renew their assessments(after a period of time) and continue the cycle. KEY THEMES CommunityOur approach to communities is based more on functional capacity and patterns of HealthyFoundations than on population size, geography, or government organization. From a primary careperspective, it is important that enough resources exist to support a local primary care system eventhough the local improvements sought may target only a portion of the community. While this incursthe risk of excluding some small groups, virtually all groups in Iowa are part of a local primary caresystem, and specific needs can be better addressed within the context of the overall system. Our com-munity coalitions, in aggregate, have a high level of understanding of their community, althoughindividual members or agencies may see some differences. The community is not simply the servicearea of the administrative agency. Several problems have arisen, however, in determining how community is defined. A community thatis loosely defined and overinclusive can affect the implementation of an intervention. In an effort toimprove health services outreach to teens, for example, a local pilot project developed a wallet-sizecard listing Confidential Health Services for Teens:This local project encompassed several primarycare systems.While exact agreement on community boundaries is not required, wide divergence is problematic.Disagreement over boundaries can affect community investment in the process as well as the successof the pilot project. One coalition is now reaching out to a series of surrounding counties because itviews these areas as part of the local service system. 99I 1 ) The community's history in working with coalitions and collaborative projects is significant. Pastfailures can have an immobilizing effect. One community whose history demonstrates strong com-petitiveness among agencies appears to be slow in progressing. There also appear to be limits in theability of communities to consider multiple issues. In one Native American community, for example,the Mesquaki tribe casino has been very successful, occupying the attention of the community. Thiscommunity decided to discontinue the Healthy Foundations pilot project because of difficulties inhiring a local Native American coordinator. The local health leadership was never able to capture thetrue attention of the elders to develop their local system of care, since they considered other tribalissues more engaging. It is important for members of a group to define their community. They know who they are and whothey serve. In proposing an intervention, they need to consider who will be affected by it. When thisimpact extends beyond the community, the state leadership attempts to assess the impact on sur-rounding communities. Community CoalitionsAlthough similarities exist in the mix of participants involved in the community coalitions, each coali-tion reflects the unique aspects of the community it represents. Public health nursing, child healthcenters, schools, education, child care, and social services are represented in almost all coalitions.Representation from consumers, private business, local government, and private medicine varies,depending on the coalition. Special efforts are made to reach out to consumer and provider groupsduring the planning process, even when the group is represented in the coalition. The Black HawkHealthy Foundations pilot project, for example, carried out a consumer survey about immunizationsand held physician forums before implementing changes in vaccine distribution. Each community coalition has a different personality. The nature of each group goes beyond agencyrepresentation. Several important factors include leadership, community history, member history,and respect within the community. Increasingly, we view our community development work as moreart than science. 100129 Some meetings are very businesslike and other groups have a more casual \"down-home.' atmosphere.Decatur County, for example, is a rural area along Iowa's border with Missouri; it is one of Iowa'spoorer counties, with child poverty affecting 25.6 percent of children in 1990, compared to a stateaverage of 14 percent.2 The coalition members in Decatur County have a notable tendency to rely oneach other; most task agreements are concluded with a sincere \"call me if you need help.\" The com-mon courtesy of calling if a member cannot make a meeting is the rule in the Decatur County coali-tion. Despite the fact that members already knew each other, the opportunity to come together andexamine what they do has been unique. When group members first began meeting, they emphasizedhow few services were available; after their assessment, they recognized that many services wereavailable and focused on the issue of referrals, especially from private physicians. System AssessmentEach coalition is responsible for participating in a review of its local health system. The assessmentprocess takes a comprehensive and inclusive look at the primary care system for children. The intentof this process is to identify fundamental areas for improvement. We have found the \"area forimprovement\" framework more useful than the problem approach,since it helps coalition members focus on the system rather than It is important forindividual health status problems. members of a group toOur state consultants and local coordinators ofien find that the define their community.coalitions have difficulty thinking in terms of system change. Most They know who theycoalition members have a strong direct care background and are less are and who they serve.familiar with system analysis. Focusing on the \"problem\" often leadsto considering a particular condition without giving full attention tocontributing factors. Informal training is usually supplied to help distinguish between health condi-tions and functional areas for system improvement. The area tOr improvement concept emphasizesbuilding on what works and making it better. In order to achieve this, contributing factors must beanalyzed, and both facilitators and barriers must be considered. This approach is more positive andless threatening. 101k.) The state supports the assessment process through dataassistance in presentation and interpreta-tionand group dynamics. The assessment includes indicators of health status, community inven-tory of services, a consumer survey, analysis of service system characteristics, and targetedcommunity surveys. The state As Warren Bennis hasobserved, leadership isabout doing the rightthings, and managingis about doing thingsright.provides core demographic data and health status indicators for thecommunity. Data are generally available for county-based projects.However, in the project addressing Hispanic issues in Polk County,most of the data were unavailable by ethnicity. This experience addedmomentum to the Iowa Department of Public Health's efforts to col-lect ethnicity data. The coalitions use project planning materials as aciarting point in examining service availability and characteristics ofthe service. The Healthy Foundations project was concerned initially about pro-viding too much data, yet communities sought more. Usually as acommunity begins to target areas for improvement, additional information specific to the commu-nity is obtained. Coalition members' anecdotal knowledge of local situations has commonly steereddata gathering. This additional information is targeted to provide specific guidance in implementingan intervention or estimating the extent of a situation. State personnel play a role in facilitating orproviding technical assistance in gathering this information. Coalition LeadershipAs often observed, within many groups there arc both nominal leaders and \"true\" leaders. However, theskill and hard work of the local community coordinator is the key factor in the group's success. If thecoordinator is unable to devote adequate time (at least one day per week), the coalition moves veryslowly. Leadership styles also are important in determining how the group proceeds. If the facilitatorhas a reactive style, it becomes more important for some component of the group to be proactive. Whilebeing proactive is generally viewed as positive, a tine line exists between being proactive and aggres-sive\"coming on strong\" in a community with a history of competitiveness can be counterproductive. 1029.4IA- As Warren Bennis has observed, leadership is about doing the right things, and managing is aboutdoing things right.3 Coalition leadership requires a balance of these two capacities. After defining aproblem, it is important to create a shared vision of an improved condition for the community. Thisskill appears to be separate from the skill of managing the process of \"getting there:' Some who havecreated a strong vision have difficulty leading the group to map out a strategy for achieving it.Healthy Foundations attempts to provide specific help, and the project's collaboration with Iowa StateExtension and the University of Iowa has proved valuable in this regard. Family-Centered CareMember agencies of coalitions have a difficult time balancing agency needs with family needs. Asadministrators work collaboratively with each other in attempting to strike this balance, difficultdecisions must be made to move toward meeting families' needs. Fragmentation in home visitingservices is a typical example. In one community, a specific agency has public heMth nursing fundsto provide home visitation for families with infants and children. Expending funds from all agen-cies involved, however, results in lack of continuity with care providers, as families are movedbetween agencies to follow the funding stream. An alternative approach calls for the agenciesinvolved to contract all home visiting to one agency. Although the final determination has not beenmade, this community has a history through Healthy Foundations of tilting the scale toward theneeds of families. The Black Hawk County Immunization Program offers another example of how communities arebeginning to succeed in collaborative efforts to provide family-centered care. To immunize childrenmore efficiently, the coalition decided to provide public vaccine to children seen by physicians in pri-vate practice, using the \"one-stop shopping\" concept by allowing families to receive immunizations atthe child's medical home. Community resources are joined together collaborativelyhospitals pro-vide courier services to deliver vaccine from the local health department to physicians' offices; physi-cians complete public forms to account for vaccine usage; and the three local hospitals providefunding for health department personnel to manage the system. 10313\" Family-centered care is a simple concept with complex ramifications for the local infrastructure ofservice providers. Decisions are not always simple. Coalitions, for example, can exert pressure onmembers or outside groups to move toward more family-centered service delivery; yet coalitionscan find it difficult to put aside political issues, turf issues, and funding issues in order to examine asystem of care openly and honestly from the family's perspective. A balance can be struck in favor offamilies, but this can place providers at financial risk since they may need to relinquish funding toanother provider. Coalition members in the Healthy Foundations experience have had to take smallfirst steps, build trust, and then take on the harder questions. Some questions remain untouchedbecause they are potentially still too sensitive. We have been most successful in educating localproviders about family-centered care; the providers who have internalized the family-centered con-cept have been the most successful at putting the family first and giving up turf issues. Successeshave followed, creating a win-win choice through joining together collaboratively. IMPLICATIONS FOR STATES The challenges for states in proceeding along the Healthy Foundations path are significant but man-ageable. Garnering and maintaining community commitment to improving the local system of careis fundamentaland achievable when states allow communities greater independence in choosinggoals and directing activities and resources. Ultimately, system change has an impact on families atthe community level.Consumers are direct beneficiaries of systems improvements. Although assuringoverall direction, basic standards of care, and infrastructure capacity remains an important role forstates, communities will become more invested over the longer term when they see progress towardthe objectives that they have charted for themselves. Success is important. It builds enthusiasm and can attract outside attention and resources. Providingtechnical assistance and changing policy at the state level in response to local-level problems can sig-nificantly affect a community's sense of its own capabilities and its ability to influence the larger sys- 1041 tem. Although improving system efficiency and cost-effectiveness is always a goal, allocation of somenew resources by states can contribute significantly to the success of community efforts (and resultin savings over the long term).Ultimately, states are challenged to promote partnerships based on tenets of mutual respect andshared recognition of the interdependence of communities and states in working toward the over-arching goalmaking systems work for families.

Medical and Health ResearchAssociation (MHRA) administers the Pediatric Resource Centers (PRCs) under contract with theNew York City Department of Health, which receives MCH Block Grant funding for this purpose fromthe New York State Department of Health.The Pediatric Resource Centers were established in 1985 as a collaborative effort between MHRAand the New York City and New York State health departments. From 1964 until this time, the NewYork City Children and Youth Projects (funded under Title V) had been providing comprehensive careto many of the city's low-income childrn. Over the years, however, despite efforts to maintain the byLucille Rosenbluth,o IA. 0 Children and Youth Projects, funding reductions, the impact of inflation, and significant populationshifts culminated in the need for a new approach to distribution of available resources. Since those resources were no longer adequate to serve the entire population in need (previouslyserved by the Children and Youth Projects) and were clearly insufficient to serve all children in needin New York City, MFIRA, in concert with the city and state, forged a program modeled after theChildren and Youth Projects but targeting low-income children and adolescents who were at particu-larly high risk for poor health outcomes, and who lived in high-need health areas. Service prioritywas accorded to children with certain sociomedical conditions, including children with parentingproblems, failure to thrive or significant nutritional problems, or birthweight less than 2,000 grams;and to children who were sheltered/dislocated, children of adolescents, and adolescent parents.Children with birthweights between 2,000 and 2,500 grams, elevated blood lead levels, severe chronicconditions, or other significant medical problems were also eligible for services, but under a secondpriority. The Pediatric Roource Centers project was envisioned as a means of also strengtheningprovider links within communities so that care could be delivered in the most rational way possible. COMPONENTS AND CHARACTERISTICSOF THE PEDIATRIC RESOURCE CENTER MODEL The service delivery model for the Pediatric Resource Centers consists of six componentsavailabil-ity, accountability, accessibility, continuity, comprehensiveness, and coordination. Health profession-als have described many of these elements as essential for providing good primary care, especiallyfor high-risk populations. This approach to the delivery of pediatric services, also referred to as the\"medical home': has been promoted by the American Academy of Pediatrics as well as by the Mayor'sCommission on the Future of Child Health in New York City.Currently, eight Pediatric Resource Centers operate at nine sites within outpatient departments ofmunicipal and voluntary hospitals and in freestanding community health centers. Each Pediatric 1081 3 7 Resource Center has developed interdisciplinary teams that offer, at a minimum, medical, nursing,social and family support, nutrition, vision, and hearing services. Other diagnostic and treatmentservicesincluding mental health, denfal, and specialty services and in-hospital careare availablethrough referrals to each project's parent institution or affiliate. The Pediatric Resource Centersactively reach out to the communities they serve and have established linkages with many other pro-grams serving high-risk children. MHRA has stimulated the development of referral mechanismsbetween the Pediatric Resource Centers and many of the other programs it administers, mostrecently with the Infant Health Assessment Program and the Early Intervention Service CoordinationProgram. These two programs, developed in response to federal mandate, are responsible for identi-fying and tracking children at risk tbr or diagnosed with developmental delays, and for assuring thatthey receive necessary services including primary care. Total PRC operating costs for 1993 (pending issuance of final expenditure reports) are expected tohover at the $13 million mark, with 40 percent coming from project-generated revenue (e.g.,Medicaid, other third-party payments, patient fees), 22 percent from the MCH Block Grant, and 38percent from applicant support. MCH Block Grant funds are earmarked for uninsured families so asto maximize financial access to enriched services for those children most in need. MCH Block Grantfunds are also used to supplement services covered by Medicaid since traditional Medicaidreimbursement does not cover the total cost of comprehensive care.During 1993, nearly 30,000 patients were seen and more than 100,000 visits were generated. Themajority of patients are either African American (52.3 percent) or Latino (34.3 percent) and fiveyears of age or younger (55.9 percent), with males and females equally represented. Medicaid cover-age continues to increase, to a great extent as a result of recent expansions in New York State eligibil-ity. Th'cl'Pediatric Resource Centers have consistently been encouraged to maximize enrollment ofeligible patients into the expanded Medicaid program and these efforts'have been largely successful,despite limited and often inconvenient MedicAd enrollment procedures. Data from FY 1993 showthat 71 percent of the patients are now covered, compared with 45 percent in 1987; 76 percent of thepatients reside in high-need health areas and 57 percent are eligible for the program because theyhave at least one of the highest priority conditions. 109 FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROCESS EVALUATION While a number of programs that had been established over the years (including the Children andYouth Projects) incorporated many of the same components later included in the PRC model, theirevaluation focused mainly on the process of care. There was some tantalizing evidence from the fewthat included outcome measures that delivery of comprehensive, continuous primary care services tohigh-risk children resulted in better patient outcomes than did other kinds of available care, butmore definitive studies were clearly needed. Cognizant that this gap in knowledge existed and thatlack of sufficient performance data in the Children and Youth Projects had made them more vulnera-ble to funding reductions, the MHRA Board of Directors wanted to ensure.a rigorous and informativeevaluation of the PRC program. A two-tiered approach was developed: (1) a process evaluation toconfirm the existence of the model; and (2) an outcome study to determine whether the model actu-ally makes a difference in the health and well-being of those receiving services. The process evaluation, designed by MHRA and the New York City Department of Health, remains inplace today (with some minor changes during the years). M H RA annually reviews and analyzes pro-ject data collected from four sources: (1) a computerized data reporting system, (2) site visits,(3) chart reviews, and (4) quarterly fiscal reports to determine project-specific compliance with thePRC model. Criteria developed jointly by M H RA, the PRC directors, and the New York City Departmentof Health are used to interpret much of the information collected. Findings for each Pediatric ResourceCenter are compiled and then discussed with the PRC directors and their staff at program reviewmeetings. Project strengths and weaknesses are explored and corrective action plans are developed asneeded. Progress toward implementing these plans is then monitored during the next year. Availability and AccototabilityThe process evaluation addresses all six components of the PRC model. Adherence to program stan-dards for availability and accountability is determined through project reports and site visits. lbassess availability, fee structures and policies, appointment systems, waiting time, and after-hours 110 coverage are reviewed. The model standards require that all patients be provided free preventive ser-vices and that families with incomes below the federal poverty level not be charged for any service.Time-specific rather than block appointments are encouraged and waiting time may not exceed1-1/2 hours. In addition, some form of after-hours coverage with potential for patient contact with anattending pediatrician is required. Accountability is tied to the existence of active quality assuranceprograms. Over the years, the projects have, on average, done quite well in these areas. AccessibilityProjects are considered accessible if they are reaching significant proportions of patients who have aPriority I condition, who have low family incomes, and who live in high-need areas of New York City.This information is obtained via the PRC Data Reporting System. ContinuityContinuity, comprehensiveness, and timeliness of preventive health care are measured throughannual chart reviews. During 1993, a random sample of patient charts was selected; these patientswere between 9 months and 5 years of age, had begun attending a Pediatric Resource Center withinthe previous 14 months, and had visited the PRC at least three times for primary care during thatperiod of time. The number of charts averaged 35 per site, but varied depending on the proportion ofvisits that each site contributed to the total program. Continuity had been defined during the first year of the program by the PRC Directors, MIIRA, andthe New York City Department of Health. The indicator that was established aims for each patient tosee the same primary care provider at 90 percent of his/her primary care visits. (The primary careprovider is defined as the physician or midlevel practitioner providing care at more than half of thepatient's primary care visits.) If individual patients are not seen by any one provider at more than 50percent of their primary care visits, these patients are said not to have a primary care provider. In1993, continuity ratings ranged from 39 percent to 95 percent, with an average total program ratingof 65 percentfive percentage points below that for 1992 but similar to the 1991 finding. Some pro- jects indicated during the program reviews that a methodology that recognizes a \"team\" of providers(rather than a single individual) as the primary care provider might be more appropriate, given thehigh rate of walk-in patients, problems with scheduling patients who see part-time physicians, anddifficulty identifying patients' primary care providers. The merits of the team definition are currentlyunder consideration. ComprehensivenessMinimum standards of comprehensiveness for the Priority 1 eligibility conditions were also devel-oped at the inception of the program by MH RA, the PRC directors, and New York City Department ofHealth staff. Three levels of severity were defined for each condition, and, within each of these, a deci-sion was made as to what types of assessments should be required and who should provide them.Based on chart abstract information, the level of compliance is calculated by comparing the totalnumber and type of services and referrals provided to the total number and type required by thestandards. Except for a minor decrease in 1990, the PRCs overall have continuously improved in thisarea, reaching a 79 percent rate of compliance in 1992. Comprehensiveness was not reviewed in 1993, due to a decision to use the limited resources forexpanding the review of preventive health measures that year. Comprehensiveness remains a centralcomponent of the PRC model, however, and will continue to be evaluated in the future. The compre-hensiveness findings have been useful not only for identifying specific problems within a PRC, butfor giving guidance to Mll RA in areas where the projects need further support. Findings related toprovision of services to families with parenting problems, for example, led NIII RA to seek and pro-vide funding to the PRCs for additional staff time and on-site parenting training, resulting in theestablishment of discrete parenting programs at each of the sites. CoordinationThe coordination measure has recently been refined to improve its validity. A determination of theprojects internal tracking of hospital admksions, emergency room visits, abnormal laboratory 112 reports, and subspecialty referrals has been made during the annual site visits and through corre-spondence with the projects. The degree to which projects follow up on missed appointments is alsodetermined during the chart reviews. The majority of projects have implemented effective mecha-nisms in these areas although a few have difficulty obtaining consistent feedback on subspecialtyreferrals. In addition, the chart audit now addresses the extent to which required referrals/consultsare actually completed (evidenced by chart notations). This assessment is particularly helpful inidentifying gaps between the project's recognition of the need for specific services as reflected by thereferral, and the project's ability to ensure that the patient received those services. In 1992, we began to review a number of preventive health measures that were no longer beingtracked, although they were previously assessed by the New York City Department of Health as partof an Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment/Child Teen Health Plan (EPSDT/CTH P) effort. This review was further expanded in 1993 to include vision, hearing, blood lead level,and tuberculosis screenings along with a determination of patients' immunization status (for timeliness of screenings and immunizations administered by the Pediatric Resource Centerswere also collected and appropriate interval scores assigned, based on a methodology thataccounted for patient status upon presentation to the PRC. Findings were presented so that projectswere informed of both the patients current status and project effectiveness in screening and imimi-nizing those patients once under PRC care. Overall, 81 percent of the required preventive health pro-cedures were carried out. Projects are also expected to be in compliance with the established productivity standard of 2,800encounters per full-time physician. This standard, which is significantly lower than that forCommunity Health Centers, was adopted to allow providers ample time to address adequately thenumerous problems of the high-risk children/families targeted by the Pediatric Resource Centers.During the most recentI 2-month period for which data are available, the projects somewhatexceeded the standard, reaching an average of nearly 3,00(1 encounters per provider. 113-'1 METHODOLOGY FOR STUDYING SERVICE OUTCOMES This section provides an overview of the methodology used in the PRC Outcome Study and brieflydiscusses some of its major findings. This research initiative was funded by a number of agenciesincluding the Bureau of Health Care Delivery in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,the New York State and New York City health departments, and the William T. Grant Foundationallof whom recognized the imperative for evaluating the relative effectiveness of a comprehensive pedi-atric care model. Dr. Jack Elinson was the principal investigator and Ms. Penny Liberatos was the pro-ject director. The main goal of the study was to answer the following questions: 1.Will the health of high-risk, low-income children enrolled in a comprehensivepediatric care program improve over time compared to their health at entry intothe program?2.Will the children enrolled in the model program have better health outcomes thansimilar children not enrolled in the model program but receiving services in thecommunity?We were interested in looking at two types of outcomes in general: the extent to which PediatricResource Centers succeeded in improving the health of the children, and the extent to which PRCshad an effect on improving the health knowledge and behavior of the mothers. To answer these questions, we used a treatment group consisting of children enrolled as patients inPediatric Resource Centers, and a comparison group that Included children equally eligible for enroll-ment in the PRCs, but who received care from other sources generally available in the community.Three high-risk groups were selected for inclusion in the study: (1) low birthweight infants, (2) chil-dren of adolescent parents, and (3) adolescent mothers. (The data collected on the latter group arecurrently being analyzed and will not be reported here.) In order to look at chang2s over time; data were collected on the treatment (PRC) group at two differ-ent points approximatO one year apart. Data on the comparison children were collected at the laterpoint so that outcomes could be compared. Data collection, which began in October 1987 and con-cluded in December 1990, included a total of 977 treatment (PRC) group children and 576 compari-son group children. The study population was predominantly African American, Caribbean Black,and Latino.The children in the comparison group were selected for their similarity to those in the treatment(PRC) group in terms of characteristics related to poverty status, risk category, and area of residence.Our information sources included birth certificate registries, child health clinics operated by the localhealth department, hospital nurseries, and friends of participants. Data were collected through struc-tured interviews with mothers (and occasionally grandmothersor guardians); the interviews included questions about healthservice utilization; child's status; child's motor, social development; preventive health behavior; andknowledge and practices with respect to child health care.Interviews were conducted by specially trained bilingual(English-Spanish and English-Creole/French) interviewers whowere similar to the respondents in cultural background andage. Medical examinations (including physical health, develop-ment, and growth) were conducted by on-site pediatricianswho completed data (--1tion forms specifically designed forthe study. Laborator.-sts, including tests for anemia andblood lead levels, also were conducted.provider involvement inthe development ofmethodologies, timelyanalysis, and feedback tofield personnel, and thewillingness to reassess andrevise approaches, cannotbe underestimated. The study staff developed innovative ways to deal with the many methodological challenges thatarose during this demanding field operation. These methods included (1) approaching potentialrespondents in the clinic waiting room; (2) sending frequent reminders to families about upcomingappointments; (3) preparing all correspondence in three languages; (4) allowing flexibility in choos- 115'4 ing a site for an interview, including a family's home or a local coffee shop; (5) reducing the lengthand bulkiness of the medical form to be completed by physicians; and (6) requesting that physicianstill out the forms at the time of the participants' appointments. Clinical and administrative staff atthe involved facilities contributed a high degree of cooperation and input, and the study successfullycollected research data from a sizable sample of low-income, inner-city children. FINDINGS Outcomes were assessed through nearly 200 variables grouped into seven categories: physical health,psychosocial health, functional health, preventive health behaviors, health knowledge and practices,utilization of health services, and Five outcome categoriesappear to have been mostaffected by the PRCs:physical health, preventivehealth behaviors, unmetneeds for care, healthknowledge and practices,and functional health.unmet needs for care. First, we analyzed data on the treatment(PRC) children, focusing on changes irom time of enrollmentto approximately one year after enro,Iment. We then comparedchildren who used the PRCs for all of their medical care(except emergency room visits) to children who were regis-tered but didn't use the PRC at all over the prior 12 months.Finally, we compared the treatment (PRC) group to the com-parison group. Minor demographic differences between thetwo groups were controlled for in the analyses. Of a total of 127 comparisons that were tested for significancebetween the treatment (PRC) group and the comparisongroup, 15 percent were found to be statistically significant.Almost 90 percent of these significant differences favored the treatment (PRC) group. Among themore important differences vere the following: PRC children were less likely to be delayed in receiv-ing immunizations, less likely to report health problems, and more likely to have received serviasthrough the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC). Five of 1161.45 the seven outcome categories appear to have been most affected by the Pediatric Resource Centers:physical health, preventive health behaviors, unmet needs for care, health knowledge and practices,and functional health. The finding that the Pediatric Resource Centers performed better in suchimportant health-related areas as immunization and enrollment in.W1C has major implications forwell-child care. Actions in modifiable areas of health behavior may have the potential to bring aboutlong-term changes in the more stable physical health status indicators. Mothers' improved health-related behaviors may have a strong impact on the long-term health of their children. The PediatricResource Centers' influence on the physical items may not have been as evident because the childrenwere followed for only one year and children in the treatment (PRC) group were v,.ry young at thetime of enrollment. Clearly, a longer study with a broader age representation is needed. CONCLUSION As we approach the 10-year anniversary of the Pediatric Resource Center program, we may concludethat the overall evaluation design has been successful in providing us with relevant and useful datafOr future program planning. The importance of provider involvement in the development ofmethodologies, timely analysis, and feedback to field personnel, and the willingness to reassess andrevise approaches as needed, cannot be underestimated. This model for evaluating pediatric primarycare is unique in its comprehensiveness and its incorporation of difficult measures. Further refine-Mill and possible replication in different settings is our next challenge. 117orA.U Accountability inPrimary Health Care SystemsConceptual Frameworks and Policy Challenges The concept of accountability has become a major element of the discourse over health carereformin part because it appeals to a wide spectrum of political opinion. On the right,accountability implies cost-efficiency; on the left, accountability implies public responsibility. Thedictionary definition of accountability contributes to this confusion, listing multiple elements ofmeaning:1 Accountability can mean \"subject to giving an accountanswerable\" or \"capable of beingaccounted tbrexplainable.\"\"Responsible is a synonym for accountability.On a less overtly political level, the rationale fbr focusing on accountability reflects a conver-gence of several trends in the evolution of the American health care system. On one hand, Americanswant to be healthier. Increasingly, the health of the public is viewed as reflecting an orientation byBernard Gayer, M.D., M.PH., Mona Shediac, Ph.D., and Holly Grason, M.A. 14 toward disease prevention and health promotion rather than toward only treatment of disease inmedical facilities.2 Within this framework, the focus of accountability is health outcome or healthstatus. This approach renders health a communal responsibility, where the health behaviors of indi-viduals have consequences for those around them. A good example is childhood immunizationanoutcome that has relevance for both personal and communal health. Unless the entire population isimmunized, the risk that children will contract communicable diseases persists. Immunization goalsare set at the community level, and the system is accountable for these goals. On the other hand, Americans want their health care to be less expensive. Controlling the cost ofhealth care has become a major, although somewhat elusive, objective of health care reform. Withinthis framework, the focus of accountability is on providing less costly, more efficient health care ser-vices. Providers are being reorganized into \"accountable health plans.\" This approach renders healthcare providers accountable to the third-party payors for health care services, rather than to the recipi-ents of health care. Underlying these converging trends is a basic tension between the respetive roles of the public andthe private sectors. Such tension is an enduring part of the American psyche which holds a basic dis-trust of government, espousing the ideals of privatization and decentralization. As health care reformprogresses, it is no longer clear whether government agencies will be responsible for maintainingpublic accountability of the health care system or whether mechanisms of the private sector market-place will be expected to fulfill this function. This paper strives to synthesize a diverse literature on the concept of accountability and to make itrelevant to the development of a primary health care system for children. We intend to explore thedomains and locus of accountability, selected issues related to its measurement, and the role of gov-ernment in emerging health care reforms. In addition, we will apply these concepts throughout to thespecificexample of ensuring accountability for childhood immunization. 120.4. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK: MULTIPLE LAYERSAND DOMAINS OF ACCOUNTABILITY Much of the debate in health care reform has centered around the proper level of involvement of gov-ernment in regulating the delivery of health care. Is oversight for the performance of the health caresystem best assumed by the private sector or by the public sector? In his book Beyond Privatization:The Thols of Government Action, Salamon3 challenges this framework. Salamon believes that thedichotomy between public and private is a simplistic distinction, and, to a large extent, an inaccurateportrayal of the true structure of the public sector. He suggests that a basic transformation hasoccurred over the past 50 years in the way government services are delivered, so that now govern-ment often functions by \"remote control.\" So-called indirect government relies on third parties todeliver services, confining its role to establishing priorities and generating funds. Thus, many gov-ernment programs are not about direct service delivery by government employees; rather, theyembody key features of privatization and decentralization. To understand these key features, Salamon proposes a framework that analyzes the distinct tools ofgovernment action, each with its own characteristics or operating requirements. The key dimensionsof these tools include: Nature (or mechanism) of the tool. Government may award grants, provide goods andservices, or impose regulations to achieve certain goals. '11) achieve better immuniza-tion coverage, for example, a state or county government might contract with privateproviders, develop provider payment capitation rates that include reimbursement forimmunization, attach regulations to reimbursement for Medicaid payments, or legis-late vaccination requirements for school entry.Structure of the deliver), system. Delivery systems may be direct (e.g., Social Security)or indirect. Indirect delivery systems include other entitiespublic, private business,and private nonprofit tOr delivery of public goods such as medical care or legal ser-vices for persons of low-income status. I 1121 Degree of centralized control. Categorical grants-in-aid, for example, involve morefederal direction than do block grants. A categorical program for administration ofimmunization services exists, as do stipulations within federal block grant programs(such as the Title V Maternal and Child Health Block Grant program) and \u00e71eventivehealth services programs. Similarly, these differing program structures cormote vary-ing degrees of specific federal control of immunization-related activities on the partof local and state governments, and the private sector.Degree of \"aptomaticity\" (i.e., the degree to which tools require detailed and continu-ous administrative activity to operate). Tax incentives, for example, rely on self-regulatory market mechanisms; in contrast, needs-tested income assistance pro-grams require administrative decision making on a case-by-case basis.Each of these tools of government has somewhat different implications for implementation and forconsequences. Among the important dimensions of these differences are administrative feasibility,effectiveness, political support, efficiency, and equity. The choice of a particular tool of governmentmust be made in light of the intended consequences for the operation of programs. Direct tools, forexample, may be easiest to manage but may not yield the greatest degree of effectiveness.Salamon's work serves to advance our thinking about ways to conceptualize and operationalizeaccountability. If the concept of accountability is to be useful in understanding health care reformand systems development, we must come to some decisions about whowill be answerable (locus ofaccountability),whatwill be explainable(domainsof accountability), andto whomthe system will beresponsible.Locus of AccountabilityThe accountable health care entity is called the locus of accountability. Under the concept of \"indirectgovernment's' public agencies share this basic function with a third (often nonfederal and nonpublic)party. Accountability for immunization coverage for preschool children, for example, may be sharedbetween a county health department (accountable for the total county population) and several healthmaintenance organizations in that county (accountable for their subscribers). Traditional theories of 122 public administration, which draw sharp lines between public and private sectors and emphasizehierarchic patterns of authority, will not explain accountability in these situations. Rather, new theo-ries and approaches must emphasize the notions of \"bargaining:'\"persuasion:' and \"incentives\" in apublic-private partnership. Another locus of accountability consists of individual consumers. Using the example of immuniza-tion, parents and families are held accountable for the immunization status of their children. Thisavenue of accountability, involving policies requiring children to be immunized by the time theybegin school at age five or six, is very well enforced throughout the country.Domains of AccountabilityThe national health care debate of the last few years has crystallized the sharp contrasts in philoso-phy surrounding the domains of accountabilityfiscal, social, political, professional, and outcomes-related. Fiscal accountability is probably the most salient of these. Among some of the managedcompetition plans (market-oriented proposals forhealth care reform, for example), purchasing coopera-tives of employers would be accountable to the mem- If the concept of accountabilityher firms (the payers), not to government.1 is to be useful in understandinghealth care reform and systems Kronick argues that \"the entity that makes decisions development, we must come to about the volume of funds flowing to health plansmust also be] financially responsible for the implica- some decisions about who willtions of its decisions:'5 His argument about account- be answerable, what will beability relates entirely to the responsibility for assuring explainable, and to whom thethat expenditures do not exceed revenues from premi- system will be responsible.ums and that the federal government is not the locusof that responsibility. Alternatively, fiscal accountabil-ity mechanisms could be developed (e.g., through reimbursement practices) that reward the provi-sion of care and are consistent with best practices such as the attributes of primary care!' 123 ?:-A. 0 The focus on fiscal accountability contrasts starkly with the social or moral responsibility reflected inthe statement of Dr. Colleen Kivlahan, Director of the Missouri Department of Health:\"In a reformedhealth care system, all providers must be held accountable for the community's health needs.Families need an integrated health delivery systemstarting from a strong population-based publichealth system, a comprehensive primary health care system and specialty services as needed.Providers of the future must be held accountable for improved health status of families and the com-munities they serve. Accountability must extend beyond the walls and into the community.\"7 Sharfstein and Sharfstein8 provide a powerful example of polith-al accountalnlityin the health field ina recent paper describing the contributions of the Political Action Committee of the AmericanMedical Association ( AMA). Although the American Medical Association officially promulgated posi-tions supporting institution of mandatory waiting periods for handgun purchase and opposing boththe \"gag rule\" and export of tobacco products, AMNs Political Action Committee contributed moremoney to candidates who opposed AMNs positions. Prol-essional accountability,videly accepted and practiced, refers to compliance with the sets of stan-dards of care and conduct established for, and largely by, the profession. Thus, the pediatric \"redbook\" sets the standards for primary care providers' immunization practices, regardless of theirpract ice sett ing. Outcomesaccountability increasingly is being promoted, with continuous quality improvement (CQI)theories and practices becoming operational in business and in government. While grants-in-aid,loan guarantees, and tax expenditures all involve the delivery of financial benefits (issues of fiscalaccountability), regulatory programs function by imposing restrictions. The regulatory programspose a challenge because there is rarely consensus about outcomes desired from a regulation orabout the relationship between a given activity or input and the desired outcome. Increasingly, out-comes accountability is becoming a powerful mechanism in driving state, community, agency, andprogrammatic decision making and resource allocation)\" I 124152 Schorr identifies three challenges in this area: ( ) developing measures of key outcomes that cur-rently are not being measured appropriately; (2) developing interim outcome measures; and(3) developing indicators of community capacity. Furthermore, challenges center on issues of collec-tive accountability of multiple entities that must work together to achieve those outcomes, as in thecase of community immunization levels. In many areas of child health, scientific problems arise inour collective inability to causally link inputs or process to health status or functional outcomes.Fortunately, this is not the case with imimmization. lb whom is the system accountable? Is oversight for the performance of the health care system bestassumed by the private or the public sector? This question has become increasingly contentious inthe national health care reform debate. Traditionally, health care providers have been accountable togovernment regulatory and funding agencies. Health plans increasingly are being held accountable toemployers for the costs and quality of services they provide. National efforts are under wav to develop uniform reporting standards for managed care organiza-tions. The Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HENS) is a core set of health plan per-formance measures that may be used as \"report cards\" on the quality of care provided by competinghealth plans. The most recent version of HENS (Version 2.0) was developed to assist the employer asa purchaser; an adapted version also has been developed for specific use with Medicaid populations.The HEMS 2.0 quality-of-care measures address public health r :iorities identified in Healthy People2000 and cover a range of health services, including preventive services, acute and chronic illness,and mental health/substance abuse. Childhood immunization is one of the quality-of-care pertnr-mance measures included in II ENS 2.0.12 The public and private sectors collaborate in various and complex ways in delivering services tocommunities. The challenge thus lies in finding avenues of accountability under a system of sharedauthority. Applying this approach to the immunization example, Bernier\" proposes that accountabil-ity for population-based immunization rests on collaboration between the private ar public sectors.In this specific area, we tind examples ol joint public- and private-sector development of the 125 Standards for Pediatric Immunization Practices, endorsed by a wide variety of organizations in thepublic and private sectors. New national immunization goals of the Centers for Disease Control andPrevention further require consensus identification of the party responsible for immunizing childrenat the service delivery level, and development of mechanisms to hold these caregivers accountable.Collaboration also is expected on measurement of community immunization rates. MEASURING ACCOUNTABILITY:FOR WHAT WILL THE SYSTEM BE ACCOUNTABLE? .At the heart of the concept of accountability are issues of measurement. Maintaining accountability ispossible only to the extent that standards for health care delivery are acceptable and clear. Moreover,there must be an agreement among the various parties about the establishment and interpretation ofmeasures of accountability. These two areassetting standards and developing indicatorsare dis-cussed in this section of the paper.Setting StandardsAccording to Green and Kreuter,\" standards can be set in several ways: arbitrary, scientific, histori-cal, normative, and compromise. In an excellent example of the utility of these standards. Green andKreuter illustrate how a combination of the various sources of standards of acceptability were used inthe development of the 1990 Objectives for the Nation for disease prevention and health promotion.Scientific standards were developed first, based on extensive reviews of the literature. Historicaltrends were then examined to project where the country might be in 1990. Next, normative objectiveswere set, based on the accomplishments of other Western countries that generally fared better thanthe United States on certain health indicators such as infant mortality. These scientific, historical, andnormative standards were submitted to a panel of experts at a national consensus conference to gar-ner agreement on the most appropriate standards. Subsequently, draft objectives for the nation weredistributed to several thousand organizations across the country for review. The feedback from thisprocess was consolidated in the U.S. Office of Disease Prevention and Ifealth Promotion publication Promoting Health/Preventing Disease: 1990 Objectives Pr the Nation. The final product, a set of 226objectives, reflected a combination of scientific, historical, normative, and compromise standards ofaccountabil4 A similar process was followed in the formulation of the Healthy People 2000 objec-tives. Objective 20.11 calls for national efforts to \"Increase immunization levels as follows: Basicimmunization series among children under age 2: at least 90 percent.\"15Development of IndicatorsAccountability has been identified as the cornerstone of all financial reporting in government. Hatryand others working under the aegis of the Government Accounting Standards Board have mademajor progress in conceptualizing and analyzing the various techniques needed to further the sci-ence of measuring what they call service efforts and accomplishments(SEA). Hatry defines this as \"being obliged to explain one's actions, tojustify what One does:''''Historically, annual financial reports are the primary accountabilitydocuments made available to the public. Because they generallyinclude little nonfinancial information, they have been criticized forproviding insufficient information needed by elected officials, citizens,and other users to assess the results of public agency operations. TheThe challenge thus liesin finding avenues ofaccountability undera system of sharedauthority. need to justify how much money is spentand how efficiently and effectively it is spenthasspurred efforts to operationalize accountability, such as developing SEA measures in many public ser-vice areas including public health. Under this scheme, measurement of the system's performance involves assessing five areas: (1) struc-tural elements (inputs or health resources), (2) process (intermediate outputs or health services),(3) outcomes (final outputs or health outcomes) and their interrelationships, (4) efficiency and cost-efficiency, and (5) certain explanatory information that enables accurate comparisons of differentprograms or jurisdictions. The need to measure interrelationships is consistent with the systemsapproach, which seeks to gather information not only on each component of the system, but also onservice outputs and outcomes in relation to inputs. 127i10 Hatry defines input indicators as \"... the amount of resources, either financial or other (especiallypersonnel), that have been used for a specific service or program. Input indicators are ordinarily pre-sented in budget submissions and sometimes external management reports.\" While health servicesdelivery systems are easily and frequently described in terms of these input indicators, it is worthmentioning that rarely do we account for the adequacy of inputs directed toward the health of chil-dren and their mothers. There is reason to.believe that these inputs are less than adequate and cer-tainly less adequate than input indicators for other vulnerable groups such as the elderly. Output indicators are defined as\"... units produced or services provided.\" Among Maternal and ChildHealth Title V programs, these output indicators (e.g., numbers of children immunized) traditionallyhave been the only measures of productivity. Unfortunately', they are virtually uninterpretable andunconvincing for accountability purposes when used alone. Outcome indicators are\"... designed to report the results (including quality) of the service.\" Ironically,in the field of maternal and child health, we have an abundance of outcome indicatorsinfant mor-tality rates, childhood immunization coverage, death rates from firearms, and so forth. The SEAapproach will help interpret these outcomes and place them in context. Eiliciency (and cost-efficiemy) indicators measure\"... the cost per unit of output or outcome.\" In tra-ditional MCII programs at the state and local levels, it has often been difficult to identify the specificcosts of specific services because personnel may be performing multiple services at the same time.Even in managed care organizations, it may be difficult to assign the specific cost of a single servicesuch as immunization. Explanatory intimnation \"includes a variety of information about the environment and other factorsthat might affect an organization's perfOrmance on SEA indicators.\" Because the health status of theirjurisdictions is influenced by many factors beyond their control, program managers and programofficials, when reporting SEA information, may worry about being unfairly compared and ultimatelyblamed for findings that are outside their control. I latrv gives the example of variations in weather 128156 conditions for road maintenance. Using the immunization example, the degree to which health insur-ance policies cover immunization services will vary across the country and will be beyond the con-trol of local officials, but will have a significant impact on the level of vaccine coverage. Hatry's concept of including explanatory data along with SEA data in public reports is a major contri-bution to the alleviation of this widespread concern. Hatry et al. argue that selection of an agreed-upon set of explanatory factors permits the examination of changes in these explanatory data overtime; consequently, their impact on health status can be more readily and more systematicallyassessed. Furthermore, prior agreement on a consistent set of explanatory data to be reported insuccessive years lessens the tendency of agencies to engage in selective reporting because of self-interest. Outcome indicators and payment rates for managed care organizations developed throughrisk adjustment methodologies might be understood as a reflection of the use and importance ofexplanatory information. SEA reporting involves these key questions: What is the level of service accomplishment? And, is thelevel of service improving, deteriorating, or remaining relatively stable over time? Six major types ofcomparisons may be made, using examples from the area of childhood immunization. Comparison of current SEA information with performance in previous years (exami-nation of trends). An immunization surveillance system can generate immunizationcoverage rates over specific periods of time.Comparisons with similar jurisdictions. An immunization surveillance system cangenerate immunization coverage rates tOr specific communities.Comparison with technically developed standards or norms. Audits of clinic andprovider records are frequently promoted to monitor immunization and other key pri-mary care practices.Comparisons of actual SEA with targets or goals set by the agency at the beginning ofthe year. Use of Healthy !WIC' 2000 objectives at all levelsprovider, community,state, aud nationalexemplifies a way to operationalize this concept. t1 29 Comparison among geographic areas or client groups within the same jurisdiction. Asnoted earlier, special target objectives for vulnerable subpopulations can (and should)be implemented, along with monitoring strategies, for the Healthy People 2000 objec-tives for immunization.Comparison of the public sector with similar private sector organizations in terms ofcosts and results. Ongoing assessments should measure comparative costs and dis-ease rates between (private) office-based clinics, public clinics, and school-basedimmunization interventions. IMPLEMENTING ACCOUNTABILITY: INCENTIVES The well-known story of the measles outbreak in Milwaukee in 1989 and 199017 demonstrates theunintended consequences of certain aspects of incentives operating in the health marketplace. Inbrief, the city experienced an epidemic in which 1,605 children contracted the disease, resulting in 441hospitalizations and five deaths. A study of the epidemic revealed that most of the cases occurredamong Medicaid-eligible children who were enrolled in managed care plans. The plans had receivedfull payment (through capitation) for families, regardless of whether needed services were provided.In fact, these plans had not been aggressively vaccinating children against measles, even though theplans had already been paid to do so!Incentives in the Private SectorAs noted earlier, however, economic and cultural trends in delivery of and accountability for publicgoods and services emphasize the use of incentives in public-private partnerships, while simultane-ously de-empty:sizing regulatory strategies. The \"Milwaukee story\" demonstrates that appropriatefinancial incentives, or removal of financial disincentives, to encourage private physicians to immu-nize all of their patients regardless of insurance coverage might have helped avert a measles outbreakin this city. In England, primary care providers are responsible for immunizing children registeredwith them. Bonuses are given to primary care providers to increase immunization levels of children 130158 registered in their case load.18 Some managed care networks have begun to implement similarapproaches. A fundamental difference between the British and U.S. systems in this regard, however,lies in the fact that all children in England are assigned a responsible provider, the.-eby assuring com-munity protection from vaccine-preventable disease.Incentives for Individual Consumers and FamiliesIncreasingly, individual consumers are being held responsible for their health behaviors; full respon-sibility placed on providers and plans may entail extensive outreach programming to bring into carethose individuals and families who tend to be under-users of the health system. By implementingincentive strategies for consumers, a true provider-consumer partnership is recognized. As notedabove, tOr school-age children, requirements for immunization prior to school entry have been quiteeffective. However, new approaches are needed for the preschool population. Some states have imple-mented sanctions, such as withholding Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefitsfrom parents who fail to have their chikhen immunized. More positive approaches can also be usedthrough providing benefit bonuses for public beneficiaries, or through reducing insurance premiumsor co-payments for higher income insured families.Incentives for Collaboration Between Public and Private Sectorsat the Community LevelOne can envision other scenarios where even broader application of incentive mechanisms mightserve to strengthen the system. In the Child Health Investment Partnership (CIIIP) in Virginia, forexample, the local health department subcontracts with private providers to give care to medicallyindigent patients. Payment is guaranteed by the public health agency for services provided (regardlessof whether a child was previously eligible for Medicaid but is temporarily or permanently disenrolled).The local health department also provides follow-up and other services (such as transportation) toenhance appointment and treatment compliance. As a result, the proportion of children with a med-ical home in the community has increased along with the immunization rates, and private providerparticipation and satisfaction with serving low-income families have improved significantly.19 131tj CONCLUSIONS The concept of accountability comes down to elucidating two related issues: Is there a responsibilityfor the health of a geographic community? If so, who is responsible? Ultimately, the answers to these questions are a matter of values. In a recent analysis comparing pri-mary health care systems in 10 industrialized countries, Starfield2\u00b0 found that, among other charac-teristics, systems that have \"a high societal commitment, as manifested by a government program ofservices that places a high value on primary care by paying for it and improving access to care,' exerta positive influence on the health status of the population. Future efforts to dev9lop accountable sys-tems of primary care can build on the concepts presented in this paper and the examples of the suc-cessful application of these concepts in the area of immunization.

University Press. 134 Primary Care Providerand System Challengesin Caring for High-Risk Childrenand Families primary care providers, particularly those in private practice, are likely to face new andexpanded roles following health care reform. Some of these changes will be due to increasedaccountability and responsibility for both the medical and business aspects of health care. Otherchanges will occur due to expanded eligibility of the population, coupled with the expectation ofmanaged care systems that primary care providers will be open to assignment of patients withoutregard to social or medical risk. Within this context, tension surrounds a number of issues, the reso-lution of which will help set the scope and adequacy of the health care system in responding to theneeds of children and youth. This paper considers these issues first, then discusses the potentials andchallenges of public-private partnerships and the nature and scope of supports that private practi- byLarry Culpepper; M.D., tioners will need to serve increased numbers of high-risk families. The relevance of these issues andthe appropriate responses may differ among states and between urban, suburban, and rural areaswithin states. ISSUES AFFECTING PRIVATE PHYSICIAN INVOLVEMENTWITH HIGH-RISK FAMILIES Need for Appropriate Provider CapacityNationally, there exists a well-documented absolute deficit of primary care providers. There is a muchlarger deficit in the number of such providers skilled in responding to the needs of high-risk familiesand willing to practice in communities where these families are concentrated. Many physicians in private practice have had exposure to low-income, high-risl families at somepoint in their careers; for many practitioners, this exposure occurred during their t. lining years inhospital settings which were without adequate resources for this group of families. ,Ithough manyprivate practitioners provide care for some Medicaid patients, this patient population is unlikely toinclude those from high-risk families with multiple problems, who often make heavy demands on apractitioner's time, and may require resources beyond those available through the average privatepractitioner. Thus, most private practitioners caring foi children in the United States have never prac-ticed within an organizational environment effective in managing the needs of high-risk families. Inspite of this, many primary care physicians chose their specialty because of their concern for high-risk families and their interest in the problems they present. Given the appropriate su'pports, suchphysicians may be interested in caring for high-risk families, though it is unlikely that the countrywill have an adequate number of these physicians during the next decade. Fcw private practices include nurse practitioners and physician assistants, who constitute an addi-tional source of primary care capacity. In contrast, such clinicians often are included in'staff model 1364 health maintenance organizations (HMOs). However, these providers constitute a small portion ofthe total primary care capacity nationally, albeit a resource potentially important in providing carefor high-risk families.Building the adequacy of the nonmedical resources required to meet the needs of high-risk childrenand youth is of equal importance in managing issues related to primary care capacity. Currently, it isthe unusual community that has adequate resources for responding to the needs of high-risk fami-lies. Additional resources are needed to provide access to care, such as transportation, translation,and child care services; specialized medical, educational, and social services for children with devel-opmental disabilities or chronic illness; and services for dysfunctional families. If such services areunavailable, even appropriately skilled and motivated primary care clinicians are severely limited inresponding appropriately to the needs of high-risk children and youth. Furthermore, these cliniciansmay become frustrated in their attempts to care for such families and may limit their practiceinvolvement with high-need populations. Models of CareDifferent high-risk families require different types of support. Some families require assistance inrecognizing problems experienced by their children and in making basic decisions about their care.Examples of families requiring this level of assistance include youth whose parents have significantmental retardation, overwhelmed single parents, some recent immigrants, and often children withinthe foster care system. A mother who has been subject to spousal abuse may require a provider whoidentifies not only her risk, but the risk to her children. In some cases, the provider may need to makebasic decisions for an immobilized woman. Other families, who may be able to identify problems, may have poor understanding of the conse-quences likely to beinvolved, and are unable to set priorities or follow through appropriately withaction. A third group of families may identify the problems and understand the consequences, butmay not be aware of the resources available or how to access them effectively. Some families simplymay require information about available resources and encouragement in accessing them. Finally, 137oLs some families may be able to manage virtually all needs of tkir children with only occasional sup-port and assistance during particularly difficult times. These families may need respite services orsimply the encouragement and advocacy of the helping professionals involved. In some families, the level of function is static and unlikely to change; in others, there is potential forgrowth, as the parents or youth learn requisite life skills, and as parents begin to deal with the prob-lems that impede the care of their children. Ideally, the primary care system wilt respond to the dif-fering circumstances of families, not only ensuring theappropriate care for the child, but also fostering the improve-ment of family functioning. Ideally, the primary caresystem will respond to thediffering circumstances offamilies, not only ensuringthe appropriate care forthe child, but also fosteringthe improvement of familyfunctioning.With regard to high-need families, the scope of the primarycare system's responsibilities and the adequacy of the medicalmodel are interrelated issues. The case manager's level ofinvolvement in outreach, prioritizing, and decision making willvary depending on the needs of the family; in addition, theclinical needs of high-risk families will be diverse, includingtraditional primary medical care, dental care, developmentaldisability services, mental health services (including servicesfor substance abuse and behavioral disorders), and preventiveservices. In order to address other problems effectively, the primary care system may need to respondto family dysfunction as a problem in its own right. Finally, the community in which the child livesmay be dysfunctional, requiring the attention of the primary care practice. In contrast to the diversity of professional services that may be required by high-need families, pri-mary care clinicians, particularly those in private pract:ce, generally follow a medical or biopsycho-social approach in their practice. This approach may be problem-oriented, involving elucidation ofthe history and objective findings, collection of additional information through testing, obtainingconsultation or information from others (including home visitation), and development of a therapeu- 138166 tic plan. Within a setting of continuity, this approach then leads to ongoing monitoring of the planwith changes in therapy as needed. The physician generally relates to families in a collaborative-contractual relationship wherein the physician provides recommendations and the patient or familyis free to follow or ignore these recommendations, including return for follow-up. The cliniciangenerally views his or her role as being supportive of the patient, possibly including advocacy inobtaining care through other community agencies. Should a patient not return for folloW-up appoint-ments, the private clinician may feel little responsibility for aggressive outreach, and indeed may dis-miss families who repeatedly miss appointments. Such a range of doctor-patient relationships may be too limited for high-need families. Alternatively,adopting the professional relationship modes used by other disciplines may be required to work effec-tively with some families. Both mental health and substance abuse treatment providers, for example,often must use confrontational tactics with which most primary care clinicians are uncomfortable.Developmental specialists may relate to parents using a developmental model rather than a problem-oriented medical model, and may engage parents as teachers of their children. A variety of professionals, including those dealing with abusive or neglectful families, use a monitor-ing and limit-setting style that includes a variety of adverse consequences for noncompliant families.While the primary care clinician may nOt need to be highly skilled in all of these modes of relatingto patients, the clinician nevertheless needs to be comfortable with using them on occasion, andreinforcing their use by other members of the health team. While high-risk infants or children may be the source of clinical concern, appropriate treatment mayneed to involve the parents or family rather than the child. In addition to caring for other familymembers individually, clinicians may determine that, in some cases, interventions are best carriedout at the family level. Postpartum depression, substance abuse, deficits in life skillsall are exam-ples where intervention with the mother and/or father may be indicated for high-risk infants. Thebreadth of the clinician's clinical competencies (including competencies of other team members) willdetermine the adequacy of response for such families. 139.1; In addition to these interpersonal and professional skills, primary care providers working in a high-risk community may need to be conversant with approaches to respond to needs at a Populationlevel, including public health, community development and outreach, and social marketing skills.While effective providers do not necessarily.need to use these skills directly, they should be familiarwith them and support their use by others in the community.Comprehensiveness versus Compartmentalization: Manager or Caregiver?The gatekeeper role, particularly within a managed care environment, is becoming one of the coreresponsibilities of primary care clinicians. Used well, this role can reinforce the primary care princi-ples of coordination, continuity, and comprehensiveness, and can assure access and accountability. In organizing the care of high-risk families, one approach is to have the primary care clinician (pos-sibly with the resources of a primary care team) assume direct caregiving responsibility for a broadset of clinical needs. An alternative approach is to compartmentalize care, with families referred tovarious organizational units, as needed. In rural America, family physicians may be \"jacks-of-all-trades:' providing medical services, arranging social services; and providing mental health counsel-ing as a part of routine practice. Some groups may include a nurse, social worker, dietitian, or otherhealth professionals who work within the same immediate physical space with the physician andshare virtually all information and decision making about the families. In this situation, the physi-cian and the other group members maintain a personal sense of responsibility for all aspects of thepatient's care. While such teams may be housed within larger group practices or HMOs, the latter oftenseparate functions such as social services, mental health counseling (even for common problems), andnutrition counseling in distinct departments. In such cases, little information may be transferredamong providers, decisions may be made by each unit, and the primary care clinician may feel littleresponsibility beyond the initial decision to refer the patient. Even the case management functionsmay be removed from the primary care clinician in such organizational arrangements. Roth approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. For many high-risk families, establish-ment of a single caring relationship that engenders family trust may be critical to accomplishing 140 long-term adherence to clinical recommendations and achieving behavioral changes. High-risk fami-lies often are overwhelmed when meeting with multiple members of a health team and may not beable to respond to the diversity of expectations and priorities. Compartmentalization, on the otherhand, may have the advantage of increasing the efficiency, depth, and scope of clinical competenciesavailable to the patient. Quality, Cost Control, and Cost ShiftingTo the extent that quality primary care reduces preventable illness, hospitalization, work loss by par-ents, and decreased functional potential of children, it may be a highly effective means of cost con-trol. However, within most reimbursement frameworks in the United States, the savings achievedmay not result in appropriate support of primary care. To the extent that provision of high-qualitycomprehensive primary care services is uncoupled from reim-bursement and support of primary care, circumstances maybe created that \"punish\" the highly competent clinician, anddiscourage private physicians from caring for high-risk chil-dren and youth.Curently, cost shifting may occur at various levels withinm;:inaged care systems, perhaps best exemplified by imple-mentation of managed Medicaid programs in various states.The state Medicaid plan may retain financial responsibility forout-of-plan services. The state may shift responsibility andrisk for a set of in-plan services to an HMO or other insurancecarrier. In turn, the HMO may shift responsibility and risk forPrimary care providersworking in a high-riskcommunity may need to beconversant with approachesto respond to needs at apopulation level, includingpublic health, communitydevelopment and outreach,and social marketing skills. a defined set of services to primary care providers. This may directly punish those providers whotake on the care of high-need patients. It also places primary care providers in a position to deter-mine the use of resources among all those for which they are directly responsible, those for which theHMO or insurance carrier is responsible, and those for which the state retains responsibility. Acute 141t_r and short-term mental health care may be a part of the primary care provider's responsibility, forexample, while chronic or inpatient mental health care may be the responsibility of the HMO, andservices related to developmental disability may be the responsibility of the state. This type of corn-partmentalization may lead to suboptimal care decisions. Depending on accessibility of services and responsibility for emergency room charges, cost shiftingmay occur among the primary care provider, the plan, the patient's family, and hospitals and theiremergency rooms. Similarly, to the extent that prevention is (or is not) carried out adequately, costshifting may occur between the present and the future. These reimbursement issues may affect the likelihood that clinicians are willing to care for high-riskchildren and youth, diagnostic and treatment decisions, the type of relationship established with ahigh-risk family, and the scope and adequacy of services they receive. Control and LeadershipIn private practice, the physician has been in direct control. Within groups, control may reside withsenior partners. Increasingly, private practitioners are complaining that they have lost control of theirpractice to the managed care industry, insurance carriers, and government regulations. This may beformalized by the selling of a private practice to a managed care company or hospital system. Whilethe Community-Oriented Primary Care (COPC) model and other models of community Control existfor federally qualified community health centers, similar patient and community involvement in gov-ernance is uncommon in private practice. The issue of control and ownership not only affects financial and administrative aspects of a prac-tice, but is likely to change the relationship of the primary care clinician and immediate health careteam members to outside health professionals and resources, and to patients and their families. Aprivate practitioner may take a high degree of responsibility and personal interest in ensuring aneffective and responsive health care organization, while the physician-employee may not. On theother hand, there may be few controls placed on the substandard private physician in contrast to 14210 those placed on the physician-employee. This may be of particular concern for clinicians who operatein relative isolation within a high-need community.There is no single right or wrong approach in addressing these issues. As a group, the issues willguide the involvement of private clinicians with high-risk children and youth as well as the organiza-tion, the location, and the management approachesand ultimately the adequacy and quality ofcare provided. In addition, the strategy for one issue will need to interrelate with the strategies for theother issues. Such trade-offs will affect high-risk families and the care they receive. For example, ifthe physician personally provides a comprehensive scope of services, this will increase the number ofprimary care providers requirai for a population and worsen the shortage of primary care providers.The degree to which professionals from multiple disciplines are involved with high-risk families,through either a clinical team or distinct services, will affect the adequacy of response by a physicianwho is personally limited to the traditional medical model of provision of care. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR A number of options exist regarding the organization of practice in the private sector. These rangefrom the solo physician with a rery limited staff to an office-based team with nursing, social service,nutrition, and other professionals who may or may not engage in home visiting and community out-reach. Large groups may involve increasingly complex primary care organizational arrangements,including compartmentalization of services and distinct professional units. In addition, any of theseorganizational entities may engage in various types of linkages and networking with other helpingresources in the community. They may have various arrangements with businesses and schools thatinclude part of the patient population they serve. This may result in varying patterns and locationsfor provision of care, ranging from an office-based setting to home, school, or work settings. Similarly, a variety of management strategies may be adopted. The physician or other clinician maybe both the administrative and clinic:I manager, or these functions may be separate. Similarly, care 1431AA. coordination and case management functions may be the responsibility of the clinician, or of a socialworker or other health team member. Priority setting and management strategies in a practice maybe guided by business interests, a medical perspective, or a community-oriented or community-based perspective. The primary care provider, though seen as the hub of the medical system, may or may not be the hubof the helping services available to a family. The increasing emergence of the \"one-stop shopping\"model of helping services may incorporate primary care in a manner that does not allocate to it acentral controlling function. For many families, the emerging family center, whether school based orother, may be more clinically effective and cost-effective than medically controlled systems, particu-larly for high-risk families where the core problems are psychosocial rather than medical.Potentials and Challenges for Public-Private PartnershipsSocietal forces currently are fostering change and innovation in developing public and private part-nerships to respond to the needs of high-risk families. Private practitioners are examining their pro-fessional relationships and organizational approaches. Many are reconsidering the basic values oftheir professional lives and the forces motivating the scope of their practice. At the same time, local,state, and federal managed care and health care reform initiatives, including those by private founda-tions, offer potential for support of innovation and major change in primary care practice. With good reason, private physicians view health care reform with concern about loss of professionalautonomy and control, fearing that they may be unable to respond to the needs of complex high-riskpatients due to productivity pressures, reimbursement limits, and disincentives to health service uti-lization at both primary care and referral levels. At the same time, total health care expenditures inthe United States are enormous, and should be adequate to respond effectively to high-need families.Viewed optimistically, current changes may result in primary care clinicians having a greater scope ofresources available to them and being more effective in meeting the needs of such families. If private physicians are to assume a significant role in the care of high-risk children and youth, theywill need to develop community linkages and networks and increased information and patient man- 144f -71i agement capacity. This must occur within an equitable reimbursement framework and within a sys-tem that fosters quality of care and accountability over a broad range of outcomes. Private physicians will require linkages to other caring professionals in the community, includingsocial service, developmental, educational, and mental health professionals responsive to the needs ofhigh-risk children and youth. This should include capacity for home visiting by nursing or social ser-vice professionals or paraprofessionals, including assessing the well-being of infants and children inhigh-risk families. These linkages should connect both ways, allowing easy access to the primary carephysician for patients referred from other community agencies (and vice versa). The data and patient management capacity required should support identification of high-risk chil-dren and youth within the community, through a tracking mechanism beginning at birth. It shouldassure timely and comprehensive assessment and subsequent management of needs, including on-going monitoring of the resulting care plan. Finally, the data and patient management capacityshould serve as an instrument for quality control and accountability, both for the primary careprovider and for other agencies involved. Reimbursement, whether capitated or fee based, must recognize that high-risk families generallyrequire more time during visits, more visits annually, and more after-hours contact, and theseencounters generally involve a greater degree of complexity, during individual contacts and overtime. To the extent that practices must improve their data and patient management abilities andinvest in the effort to establish and maintain required community linkages, they should receiveappropriate funding. Time required for these activities is not directly related to the number of visitsor patients served and may require substantial investment up front. Private Practice Involvement: Three ModelsAt least three models exist for private physician involvement with high-risk children and youth.Basically, they involve different types of linkages beween the medical clinician and other requiredcare providers (see table, next page). 1451'73a Developing Primary Care Capacity in Communities Public-Private Partnership Options Organ izat ionLinked TraditionalPractice Traditional ModelNcopof PracticeNlodel Assumes Responsibilityfor Developing a Systemof Care within ItsCommunityCase Nlanagement Separate Entity (Which May Practice Assumes Some or All Practice Assumes MostProvide Non-medical Services) Case Management Case ManagementResponsibilities FunctionsDoctor-Patient Nlanagement SeparatePartial Integration Separate or IntegratedRelationshi pCare Coordination Physician May or May Not Physician Involved, Possible Less Grouping ofTake PartGrouped Appointments Appointments NecessaryCare Team Communication Lhnited Increased HighCase Identification and FormalFormal and Informal Dictated by ClinicalEnrollment Procedures IssuesFinancial Management Straightforward Complex Less ComplexPotential for Cost Shifting Great Considerable ReducedRole in Qualit y Controland ConummityLittle I ncreasedMajor Responsibility Development The first model is thelinked traditional practice.\" In this model, a physician maintaining a fairly tra-ditional solo or group private practice agrees to work with a distinct entity that assumes coordinatingresponsibility and possibly provides some or all nonmedical care components. Such units may bebased in state departments of health or human services, community health centers, community hos-pitals, or other community agencies. At a minimum, the private physician agrees to provide primarycare services and to be responsive to coordination and tracking activities. The traditional doctor-patient relationship is altered to include formal and informal information sharing with a case man-ager. Patients may establish their primary relationship with the case manager rather than thephysician. The physician's role in needs assessment may he limited to traditional medical assess-ment, with other areas evaluated independently under the direction of the case manager. The pri-mary care clinician may or may not take nart in regular care coordination meetings; however, theclinician does agree to be part of a larger \u00b0team that is responsible for primary care and related ser-vices. Currently, many Child and Adolescent Service System Program (CASSP) groups Operate in thismanner. The physician's basic responsibility is to identify and care for medical concerns brought lwthe patient, and to share information with a separate party that assumes responsibility for compre-hensive care coordination and provision of nonmedical care. This approach requires specific identifi-cation and enrollment of high-risk children and youth in the program. Ideally, identification offamilies to be enrolled may occur through the physician's practice, the coordinating agency, or refer-ral from other community organizations. A second model may be termed the \"activated practice.\" In this model, the primary care practiceassumes greater responsibility for the high-risk family. This may involve the physician or other clini-cian assuming some case management responsibilities both for initial assessment and for ongoingcare coordination. It may involve on-site or closely linked services by social workers, nutritionists,mental health counselors, or other professionals. These providers may be in the direct employ of thepractice or available through contractual arrangements with other comimmity agencies. The prac-tice, for example, may group patient visits during one or two half-days per week when additional staffarc present and different scheduling patterns arc maintained. In this arrangement, the physician assumes greater (though not necessarily complete) responsibility for an expanded set of primarycare needs of high-risk faryilies. Communication with other team members is increased and is oftenface to face, rather than through exchange of forms and occasional phone calls. High-risk childrenand youth are likely to be identified as a separate population for tracking purposes, although the dis-tinction between this group and other patients in the practice may be blurred, with other patientsreceiving expanded services as needed without full involvement in the practice's high-risk system.Patients who need developmental services or special mental health or substance abuse treatment ser-vices may continue to receive them from other agencies, with little involvement beyond referral bythe primary care practice. The third model involves a \"fully activated practice\" that assumes leadership responsibility for devel-oping a system of care for high-risk children and youth within its community. This generally willrequire an on-site team of providers skilled in the various disciplines required by the high-risk popu-lation to be served. Such practices likely will have many of the characteristics of a fully functionalCommunity-Oriented Primary Care practice. This includes formal mechanisms to identify compre-hensively the needs of individual families as well as to assess the needs of the target community andto prioritize and plan an expanded primary care system accordingly. The primary responsibility forcare coordination is assumed by the practice, including monitoring the effectiveness of agencies pro-viding specialized developmental, mental health, or other set-, 1 such practices, there may be ac:ontinuum of care coordination intensity closely responsive to the ability of the family to manage itsown care arrangements. High-risk children and youth may or may not be identified distinctly fromother patients (either within or outside the practice). Of note, within these three models of care, truly high-risk children and youth are likely to receive verysimilar services because all three systems are likely to include case management and monitoringactivities and to involve the efforts of multiple professionals and agencies. Similarly, independentlyfunctioning families with parents who are highly competent in managing the health care system andarranging other types of care required by their children also are likely to obtain adequate care in anyof these three arrangements. However, a third group of familieswho may have a moderate level of need or episodic need due to temporary parental absence, illness, or other dysfunctionmay not beidentified as high risk but may still have increased needs. These families are likely to be served quitedifferently within these three models of care, receiving the best care from the fully activated practice. Differentiation among these three types of practice is somewhat artificial; each model has multiplevariations, so that a continuum among the three is a better description of what is possible. Althougha conscientious private physician in the traditional practice model, for example, may take the extrasteps to see that individual patients receive adequate care, such a response cannot be considered rou-tinely available to the community for moderate-risk children and youth. In addition, it is possible that, over time, practices could progress from the first to the third model. Aprogram to develop practices might stage the expansion of a practice's role over time. This might becoupled with needs assessment within the community as well as practice and clinician development.Needed development is likely to include additional training as well as development of systems withinthe practice and community. This might be supported by philanthropic, managed care, or state funding. In addition to these models of private practice involvement, similar variations are likely to occurwithin staff model HMOs. Managed care organizations may create hybrids in which staff model prac-tice units are linked to private practitioners who function following one of the above models, butrelate primarily to managed care coordinating staff. CONCLUSION Within the rapidly changing health care environment, private practitioners have a number of optionsthrough which they may increase their ability to care for high-risk children and youth. Changes towardadvanced models of practice may be made incrementally or in major steps. Increased skills, alteredmodels of relating to patients and their families, and assistance from other helping professionals andagencies will be required. Increased data and patient care management capacity and an expanded model of care and doctor-patient relationships also are likely to be required. Funding these changesmay require core support to a practice as well as increased reimbursement per patient tbr high-riskchildren and youth. Finally, such changes in practice will best be accomplished if guided by health ser-vices research and supported by changes within the professional education of physicians and otherhelping professionals. 150 1s Meeting the Contemporary Needsof Children and Youth withDeveloping Primary Care SystemsIssues for Pediatricians in Health Care Reform NEW VISIONS Meeting the health needs of children and youth requires: (1) universal access to tradi-tional personal health services, both preventive and treatment services; (2) community-wide services, such as fluoridated drinking water and safe playgrounds; and (3) multisystem servicesto overcome tile burdens of poverty, environmental pollution, violence, substance abuse, and inade-quate parenting.Recently, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and ServicesAdministration and the Medicaid Bureau of the Health Care Financing Administration conveneda panel of experts 1() develop national guidelines for health supervision of children and youth. bySusan Aronson, M.D.,F.A.A.P ) C6a. Iei Bright Futures: Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children, and Adolescents details the con-tent of health visits the experts expect will contribute to positive social, developmental, and tradi-tional health outcomes; these services are summarized in table 1. Today's health care system is poorly equipped to comply with the guidelines presented in BrightFutures. Health services are delivered by a variety of providers in private community-based offices,institutional clinics, and tertiary care practices with or without linkages to primary care providers.Health professionals deliver preventive services in compact units of time intended to achieve com-prehensiveness through continuity of family-provider relationships. For the most part, providersexpect families to make and keep appointments, respect after-hours arrangements for emergencycare, understand or ask for additional explanations, have the resources and commitment to followinstructions, and obtain medications. The American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines for routine health supervision distribute the work ofanticipatory guidance over frequent visits in a manner similar to Bright Futures. The schedule recom-mends services based on the vulnerable periods in the child's life. Younger children make more fre-quent visits than older children for preventive and illness care. Frequent preventive visits buildrelationships between families and health professionals. They also provide opportunities forproviders to reinforce parenting skills and give anticipatory guidance to prevent illness and injury.These services particularly benefit families who lack experience in caring for children and who donot receive reliable advice from extended family members. While sick care visits are narrowlyfocused on the presented problem, they also offer opportunities to monitor and provide missed pre-ventive services such as immunizations.

Itrigh Futures:Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infant% Children, and Adolescents. 157BEST COPY AVAILABLE CURRENT SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS AND CHALLENGES Provider CompensationCompensation of providers is determined by patient demand for service, the size of a practitioner'spatient panel, and fees for patient care. For salaried providers, these factors determine the salary scale.For fee-for-service practitioners, these factors directly influence take-home income. My discussionswith colleagues suggest that, in both compensation systems, productivity expectations and paymentmechanisms strongly influence the amount of time spent per patient visit and the frequency of visits. In 1989, the mean duration of an office visit (sick and well) to a pediatric specialist was 12.6 minutes,with 39 percent of the visits lasting 6-10 minutes, 29 percent of the visits lasting 11-15 minutes, and16 percent lasting 16-30 minutes.2 Preventive visits generally take more time than routine sick-childcare. In a recent study by the American Academy of Pediatrics, pediatricians reported the length of Ta b le 2Length of an average preventive care visit, including timespent by ancillary personnel Age of PatientsNumber of RespondingPediatriciansMean Numberof MinutesBirth to 2 years 66525.93 to 5 years 65525.06 to 11 years 65524.012 to 17 years 65627.318 years or older 414 27.4 158BEST COPYNAMEpatient visits for routine pre-ventive care (table 2). If all careand services performed byoffice personnel are included,pediatricians report the meanduration of a preventive carevisit is 24-27 minutes, with thelonger visits for teenagers. Ofthis visit time, pediatriciansreported the mean physiciantime with the child and parentwas 16.9-20.3 minutes (table3). The shortest visits werereported for children between6 and 11 years of age.3 Children under 18 years of age see their doctors often, averaging about 4.2 physician visits per childper year. Children under 5 years of age average 6.7 physician visits per child per year. The frequencyof visits by white children is greater than by black children. In 1987, white children averaged 4.6 visitsper year compared with 3.0visits per year for black chil-dren. Low-income children, onaverage, have one less visit peryear than middle-income chil-dren.With fewer visits forlow-income and minority chil-dren, more must be accom-plished in a single visit. Forconsumerprotection,health care systems and pro-viders should be required tomeet quality standards andprovide accessforchildrenwith special health needs. Capitation rates and fees should be adjusted for chronic illness, age, andsocial and other risk factors, as incentives for accepting patients with complex needs. Without suchincentives, effective outreach and comprehensiveness become luxuries, not essentials. Capitationrates and low copayments remove access barriers and discourage provider-initiated overutilization.However, with financial barriers to access removed, health providers need mechanisms to assure thatservices are not consumed inappropriately, but reach those who truly need care.Table 3 Length of an average preventive care visit, including only timespent by the pediatrician with the child and parents Age of PatientsNumber of Responding Mean NumberPediatriciansof Minutes Birth to 2 years 3 to 5 years 6 to 11 years 12 to 17 years 18 years or older667 18.1 661 17.2 659 16.9 661 20.0 421 20.3 Pediatric primary care providers charge relatively lower fees per patient and have proportionatelyhigher overhead costs than providers of adult care. Thus, discounted pediatric fees and capitation 159 BEST COPY AVAILABLE rates are much closer to office overhead costs than similarly discounted fees paid for adult healthcare. Pediatric practice is high volume and low margin with little room for economy and increasedefficiency. Discounted fees that are barely above cost encourage providers to increase volume anddecrease patient contact time to generate enough income for a viable practice. More revenue for pri-mary care is generated from the higher frequency of visits by young children than from visits byolder children. Thus, younger children are the life's blood of a pediatric practice. In 1992, I closed my established private practice to teach and deliver primary care in an academicsetting. It was easy to find physicians for families in my practice who paid fee-for-service charges orhad infants and toddlers enrolled in a health maintenance organization (HMO). (The HMO capita-tion for infants is approximately $30-35 per child per month.) However, few practices would acceptthe families in my practice who had older children only. In HMOs in my area, payment for olderchildren is approximately $8-9 per child per month. And no practitioners wanted my patients withspecial health needs or my families with complex problems. Some of the children with complexmedical or family problems I now see in my academic primary care practice setting should beserved closer to their homes, but the doctors in their communities lack sufficient economic incen-tive to spend the required time with them. These physicians also lack easy access to necessary sup-port services for patient education, coordination of referrals, and patient/family support to care forcomplex problems.Management ProceduresAnother barrier to providing quality care is the increase in paperwork. Paperwork limits the amountof time available for interaction between families and health professionals during a patient visit. Inmy current practice, the schedule allots 15 minutes for the typical well-child visit of an establishedpatient. In this time, I must perform and document the patient's history, the physical examination,and my anticipatory guidance in the medical record. 160lES I must also obtain signed consent forms for immunizations, and complete a series of other forms.These include an encounter form to enter diagnosis and billing information; an order form for labo-ratory tests; a form for recording the findings of the examination for the Early and PeriodicScreening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) program under Medicaid (or a separate encounterform if the patient is a member of an HMO); a form to qualify the patient for the SpecialSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC); a report of the child'shealth status for the early childhood education records, school, or sports program; a parent-heldimmunization record; and, if the child is in foster care, a separate report to the foster care agency. Ifthe child needs special care, I must complete a form for each referral. In The Children's Hospital ofPhiladelphia, medical records are not always accessible, so I also keep notes on a \"shadois\" record forreference at my desk when I have a patient encounter without the chart. Documentation alone takesat least 15 minutes for each patient. Each telephone encounter is documented using protocols that help assure quality and protection inthe event of a lawsuit. Federal law requires extensive documentation for simple in-office laboratoryservices (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act), control measures for blood-borne pathogens(Occupational Safety and Health Administration), and evidence that services are not being denied toemployees or consumers with disabilities (Americans with Disabilities Act). Independent practition-ers must keep these records or risk fines. Each third-party payor has a different encounter form anddiscounted fee schedule. Anxiety over exposure to medical liability requires time-consuming exces-sive documentation and medically unnecessary services \"just in case\" a decision is questioned. Inevery setting, these factors increase overhead costs.Patient Expectations and Health Services Needs and UtilizationMedicaid expansion and improvements in Medicaid fees have made a difference in access to care forlow-income families. With Medicaid expansions, the number of childrea added to the Medicaid pro-gram increased nationally by 36 percent between 1991 and 1992. In Pennsylvania, that number 161 increased by more than 53 percent.6,7 The American Academy of Pediatrics plans to publish data thatshow an increase in pediatrician participation in Medicaid and an increase in patient load covered byMedicaid since these expansions. Expanded Medicaid coverage and increased Medicaid fees canbring more low-income patients into private practice settings. Many practitioners feel they have few incentives to welcome and work with low-income familiesMedicaid is often associated with increased paperwork, low fees, and delayed payments. Waiting andexamination rooms are jammed when families bring all their children to every visit because they donot have or cannot pay for alternative child care. Some low-income children have unmet medicalneeds for preventive health care and chronic health problems. Low-income patients more often missappointments or come late because of transportation and other problems. In the Primary PediatricPractice at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the no-show rate is 40 percent; this can be reducedto 30 percent only by attempting to call every family the day before the visit. The.on-time arrival andno-show rates fluctuate widely. Compensatory overbooking often results in long waiting times. Health providers must modify service delivery to respond to consumer behavior. More low-incomefamilies use after-hours care because they cannot take time off from work without losing their jobs,or because of poor planning. More low-income patients do not seek and use telephone advice for ill:ness appropriately, fail to comply with instructions to follow up by phone, and do not follow careplans because they do not understand them or do not have the resources to comply. Some forget tobring their insurance information to each visit, or to do what is necessary to keep their insurancecoverage current. Health professionals have a hard time contacting those families who lose theirphone service and change their address when they cannot pay their bills. Primary care practitioners lack the tools to address the causes of many health problems. Poverty,single-parent families, teenage parents, dysfunctional families, injuries, environmental poisons, sub-stance abuse, irresponsible sexual activity, and chronic and incurable disease increasingly threatenthe health of pediatric patients. Poverty must be addressed through education, housing, and jobr\\162 opportunities. Risk-taking behavior and removal of environmental hazards require social and politi-cal action. Physicians need education, time, and compensation to collaborate with other communityprofessionals as members of a team working together to help solve these problems. To serve families with complex needs, physicians must work with home health agencies, educators,and social service agencies. Case management and care coordination take time outside the usualpractice schedule. Currently, practitioners squeeze in telephone contacts with other agencies before,after, and in-between patient visits. Few physicians have time to attend interdisciplinary meetings tocoordinate medical care with other services required by their patients. In settings that provide carefor many patients with complex needs, a care coordinator may be hired to represent the medicalpractice in such activities. Armed with special credibility in our society, physicians can advocate for their patients in servicesystems and seek social and political change in their communities. However, advocacy activities alsotake time away from the practice schedule. Compensation for out-of-office work is unusual.Expanding expectations for the role of practitioners add to the stress of health professionals whostruggle to serve families competently. Some physicians have adapted to practice pressures by making more efficient use of patient contacttime. As many services as possible are provided by ancillary personnel before and after the healthprovider encounter. Many offices now gather data through self-administered forms and provideinformation through handouts. However, self-administered forms and handouts are not suitable forfamilies with low literacy levels or those who bring multiple children who demand continuous atten-tion from parents. Health care reformers must address the similarities and differences in the objectives of consumersand providers in the health service relationship (table 4). Where there are differences, the systemmust make accommodations and educate consumers and providers about the ultimate value of the 163191 Table 4 What Families and Providers Want from Primary Care Unique Objectives Common Objectives Families Primary CareProvidersservice on demand, personal care; pleasantexperiences; convenient location; convenienthours; reassurance confidencein competence; autonomy, controlof lifestyle; status rolescontinuity of no charge at i.lint,of service;little hassle from deductibles,coinsurance/payments; littlepaperwork hassle compromise to them. The cost-containment imperative is insufficient rationale to cover all patient/provider accommodations. THE POTENTIAL AND CHALLENGES IN DEVELOPINGCOMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMS OF CARE The debate over health care reform is shaping public policy and allocation of public resources. Asmany voices as possible must call for adequate resources and accountable systems to meet the needsof children and youth. Health care reform must expand access to primary care and reduce unneces-sary administrative burdens on families and practitioners. The focus of care must return to servingthe child and family, instead of serving the system of care. More primary care providers must belured by incentives to work in medically underserved rural and inner-city areas, not coerced bythreatened sanctions or the need to relieve heavy debts acquired during their education. JEST COPY AVAILABLE Expanding Capacity with Midlevel PractitionersWhile Medicaid has increased access for harder-to-serve families, in many states, this financing sys-tem preserves a two-class system of care through deeply discounted compensation. Some suggestthat a large cadre of midlevel practitioners should be educated to provide primary care for families intraditionally underserved areas at lower cost than physician care. How will midlevel practitionersgive sufficient care to populations with high need and chronic medical problems? Midlevel practi-tioners lack the rigorous education of physicians. In my experience, few midlevel practitioners arewilling to work extended hours. How will service by midlevel practitioners achieve positive healthoutcomes and cost savings? I have worked with and been preceptor for pediatric nurse practitioners and physician assistants inboth inner-city and suburban practice settings. While midlevel practitioners often spend more timewith families and improve patient satisfaction, they do not necessarily reduce the cost of care. At TheChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia, after a period of employing pedi-atric nurse practitioners, the Primary Pediatric Practice returned torecruiting only pediatricians. On balance, the added cost of physiciantime required to supervise the patient care of nurse practitioners, theassumption of medical liability for the nurse practitioner's work bythe supervising physician, the extended working hours accepted byphysicians, and the high market rate for compensation of nurse prac-titioners made hiring physicians a better buy.The focus of care mustreturn to serving thechild and family,instead of serving thesystem of care.Incentives for Quality and Innovations in Service DeliveryHealth care reformers must resolve the conflict between resource limitations and approachesrequired to provide comprehensive care for children. lb improve their efficiency and effectiveness,health providers must have the resources to invest in the development and installation of new tech-nology such as computer tracking awl management information systems. Despite the lack of datashowing cost-effectiveness, payors and providers must agree to some set of fairly compensated pre-ventive services. Once the service goals arc set, health care reformers should develop incentives for quality and innovation in service delivery. Some managed care systems already provide financialincentives for quality indicators such as medical record documentation, immunization completeness,no-show outreach, and extended office hours. The rewards must be prompt and substantial to make adifference. In Great Britain, for example, physicians are paid a bonus of 5 percent of their annualcompensation for achieving complete immunization for 90 percent of their patient panel.%Public Health and Pediatricians' Roles and Partnershipsfor Meeting Population NeedsIn addition to individual practices, many pediatricians already are involved in new roles as practi-tioners of community pediatrics. E Edwards Rushton, director of the Office of Community Pediatricsof the American Academy of Pediatrics, defines community pediatrics as \"a body of clinical skillsthat allows a pediatrician to diagnose health services needed by children in the community and touse community resources, including people and institutions, to respond to those needs:' Child healthproviders need special training in how to view and serve the community as another type of patient.The payback for altruistic physicians who undertake this work as a sideline to their practice is sub-stantial: increased self-esteem, improved effectiveness in caring for families with complex problems,and practice-building associated with increased credibility in the community. While we applaudthese dedicated pediatricians, their work as practitioners of community pediatrics can supplement,but cannot replace, systematic community health planning and allocation of resources. The need for practitioners of public health has never been more acute. To provide effective service tothe community, how can public health link with private practice? First, we need consensus on objec-tives of health service delivery. We cannot expect to deliver all services in the practitioner's office.Some will be more effectively delivered in settings such as child care, schools, or the home. These ser-vices must be organized and delivered without fragmenting or duplicating health care. Continuity offamily-provider relationships is essential to quality care.. Health care planners need to have surveillance data collected by public health agencies. By monitor-ing unmet needs and the effectiveness of interventions, public health professionals can direct effi-cient use of scarce 11,:lth resources. Private practitioners must be involved in setting community 166 objectives, too, so that their efforts can be harnessed to achieve health objectives. Public health andprivate practitioners must work together to weave a seamless web of service for children. For exam-ple, we can target and fund a pool of social workers, nutritionists, and mental health professionals toserve high-risk families such as single and teen parents, and families at risk who are identified by anyprovider in the community. In addition, public health professionals must assure regional availabilityof specialty services for those uncommon medical problems that no one health provider could beexpected to handle competently alone. Public health professionals should provide services that are delivered more efficiently and effectivelyat the community level than at the level of the individual provider. In addition to the pool of social,nutritional, and mental health services for practitioner referrals, public health authorities shouldorganize cornmunitywide programs for environmental health (surveillance and technical assistancefor group care facilities, food handling, pest control, lead screening and abatement), mental health(disaster management), nutrition programs (WIC), oral health (fluoridation of drinking water),health education (smoking cessation, responsible sexual behavior), and prevention via regulation(immunization for school, seat restraints, bike helmets, smoking bans in public facilities, licensure offacilities and operators, gun control). The Pennsylvania chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (PA AAP) has developed severalprojects that illustrate statewide public-private sector collaboration among health professionals. Forthe past I 1 years, the PA AAP has contracted with the state to provide transportation safety educationfor parents and children. Using funds from the National Highway Transportation SafetyAdministration, the state government purchases service from the PA AAP to link the public and pri-vate sector resources to promote car seats, seat belts, pedestrian safety, bicycle safety, and school bussafety, and to prevent the use of alcohol and other drugs, and dangerous driving behavior by teens.The PA AAP's Early Childhood Education Linkage System (ECELS) is in the fifth year of operation.Now funded by state-administered Child Care and Development and Title V Block Grams, ECELSprovides information, training, and linkages with health professionals to improve health and safety inearly childhood group care. 167 ECELS uses immunization and health service data gathered by licensing inspectors from child carecenters to identify pockets of inadequate preventive health services. When a licensing inspector findsthat a facility's child health records lack documentation of up-to-date preventive health services,ECELS contacts the child care facility to offer linkage with a community health nurse or local pedia-trician. The public or private health professional first determines whether the problem involves docu-mentation or an actual gap in service. The health professional then helps underserved familiesarrange care within the community. ECELS also uses the aggregate data to identify regional andstatewide problems of access to preventive health services.Organizing for Flexible Approaches to the Provision of CareNew sites of service delivery will work only if service providers at the alternative care settings haveadequate facilities, achieve a high level of information exchange to coordinate services amongproviders, avoid fragmentation of care, and receive adequate compensation for service rendered.These arrangements will be temporary experiments unless new modes of service delivery match theneeds of families and providers. Denver's After-Hours Program is an example of an innovation that meets the needs of both patientsand providers. Specially trained pediatric nurses use standardized protocols and selected service sitesto assure after-hours access to competent telephone advice and to reduce the burden of after-hourspediatric care for physicians. More than 100 physicians subscribe to this service. The cost to the physi-cians is between 1 percent and 12 percent of the:r annual net income, including lost revenue from notseeing the patient after-hours. A little more than half the patients are managed by telephone only; 20percent require an after-hours patient visit; and 28 percent receive advice and are seen the next day inthe primary physician's office. In the first four years of operation, 100 percent of the participatingphysicians and 96-99 percent of patients were satisfied with various aspects of the service.8 Other service delivery innovations include arranging for extended office hours by hiring personnel towork those hours when patients want care, or setting up centralized after-hours care sites that coor-dinate with primary care systems to assure quality care. Some emergency rooms that are over-burdened with nonemergency care have set up adjacent walk-in care facilities to which patients arc 168I 9 G sent by a triage nurse. About a year ago, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia established such aservice. This low-intensity walk-in service (called \"fast-track\") is an adaptation to the behavior offamilies who seek after-hours care from the emergency room for their mildly ill children. Patientsreceive written information from the visit to take to their child's usual source of primary care.Promotion of school-linked health care deserves qualified support. Some health services may bemore effectively provided at child care facilities and schools. For example, developmental assess-ments of young children may be more reliable when performed in natural settings by people whoknow the child well. The three-dose regimen for hepatitis B immunization of teenagers could be pro-vided in school so children do not have to make three trips to a health care facility. Traditionally,schools have performed sensory screening; however, few child care and school facilities have suitableenvironments for confidential examinations and technically adequate comprehensive screening.Recently renewed interest in family service centers at sites convenient to the community is reminis-cent of the settlement houses of the early part of the century. Some of these new centers, however,may be little more than an effort by the schools to bring in increased revenue. Poor-quality, frag-mented, and duplicated services will result unless these sites of service assure that parents areinvolved appropriately, that the child has care informed by the child's medical history 24 hours a dayevery day of the year, and that a mechanism exists for exchanging data with the child's other sourcesof health care. Any site where families congregate in the community offers an opportunity for health education andhealth promotion. Outpatient waiting areas can show educational videotapes of good quality andoffer interactive computer/video health education ganles. Waiting lines at food stores, exhibits inshopping malls, traveling educational programs for child care and school curricula, mass media, andeducational videotapes stocked at commercial video stores hold great potential for communicatinghealth messages. One national fast food restaurant chain (McDonald's\u00ae) has entered into partnershipwitE immunization advocates and will use tray liners and prizes as incentives for complete immu-nization of children. The exercise courses found in many communities provide ongoing messagesabout fitness. Better use of ordinary places to remind residents about fitness activities in the courseof daily duties could further promote participation. Posting reminders on low shelves of grocery 169..rt41 stores, for example, could remind shoppers to bend and lift with the knees, and teach lessons abouthealthy back care. NATURE AND SCOPE OF SUPPORTS NEEDEDBY PRIVATE PROVIDERS TO TAKE ON THESE CHALLENGES Bright Futures: Guidelines JC)r Health Supervision of Wants, Children, and Adolescents presents a broadscope of practice for the typically developing child. As health care reform moves from proposal toprogram, incentives should be provided to deliver the package of preventive services. The design ofthe service system must foster relationships that strengthen the therapeutic alliance between healthproviders and families. Payors must compensate providers fairly for time spent delivering compre-hensive care and must use relatively invisible measures to account for services provided. Privatepractitioners must be more involved in teaching medical students and residents and in conductingresearch on how to function effectively in a primary practice setting. The time spent by practitionersin these activities should be fairly compensated, not donated. Human service providers within the same community should not have to discover each other by acci-dent. Orientation for new providers who enter the community should include informtioa about howto coordinate with other services and how to work with local systems to get rid fairly for work.Orientation should be seen as a welcoming service for professionals and supported as a public healthactivity. lb make the systems work (and not just increase the hassle), private practitioners should participatein designing, implementing, and staffing the systems in which they are involved. New condition-specific protocols are being developed by national professional organizations. If these are tested andvalidated in practice, tl_ley %yin help improve quality of care and limit medical liability for the profes-sionals who follow them. 1 c%170lt3 Children with special needs require additional services. To avoid more costly dysfunction and wastedservices, coordination of care must be a compensable service. Many children have special needs, butthe complexity of problems varies from one child to another. Professionals who work with childrenand families need a mechanism that provides fair pay when service requires extra time.Implementing a pediatric-specific Resource-Based Relative Value Scale may offer appropriate incen-tives. With enhanced compensation to offer health providers, families with complex problems mightbecome empowered partners rather than dependent supplicants in their interactions with healthprofessionals.New services should be vigorously marketed to all providers with whom the service might link fami-lies. Within a community, joint training of support staff where common content is involved wouldpromote interpersonal relationships across service systems. For example, child developmei:t is a topicof common concern for social service, auxiliary staff in health agencies, and child care facilities.Community colleges could offer training on core topics within a given community, and arrange forappropriate credentials for individuals within their own professional system. Knowing someone byname in another agency makes contacts on behalf of clients/patients much more effective. Jointtraining and orientation to services should encompass services for families with special needs(whether or not these needs include a child who has special health problems). Access to support systems must be improved at the community level. We must stop proving over andover that home visitation is an effective intervention for young families. We should implement a uni-versal home visitor program for pregnant women and for newborns, with continued service for fami-lies who need extra support. Home visitors must be competent in the cultures of families as well ashealth care systems so they can function as advocates for both. We need routine, effective communi-cation between primary care providers and tertiary care subspecialists. Relationships between pri-mary care and tertiary care providers must be built on mutual trust and respect for the roles eachplays in promoting health. To serve patients with complex needs, one case manager should be desig-nated to communicate with families and all service providers (not one case manager for each pro-gram serving the family). Where multiple case managers are involved, a clear decision should bemade about which one can most appropriately serve the needs of the child and family. 171199 Public health authorities must be charged with organizing systematic approaches to deal withstressed single-parent families, parents who abuse alcohol and other drugs, abusive parents, intellec-tually limited parents, culturally disparate families, families with genetic disorders, and noncomph-ant families. Private practitioners should be able to contact a pool of resource professionals whensuch families exhaust or exceed the abilities of the ordinary practice. Finally, the computer whiz kids in business must strive to make electronic information gathering,recordkeeping, business systems, and health education tools that are safe, user-friendly, time-saving,cost-saving, and capable of improving patient and provider outcomes, including satisfaction. Thekeyboard must replace the piles of paper that preserve confidentiality only by getting lost repeatedly.The secrets of health recordS might be better protected by electronic systems than by the currentpaper process. Charts are routinely left outside examining room doors and on desks, misplaced, orcopied by clerks on signed request from an individual claiming to be the child's parent. CONCLUSION As a national officer and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, I am an advocate forchildren and for pediatrics. Our response to health care reform should not be just to plan for thefuturewe must make the future happen. If we feel overwhelmed by the challenge, we must remem-ber the Amish schoolhouse saying: \"1 am just me, but I am still someone. I cannot do everything, but Ican still do something,. Just because I cannot do everything does not give me the right to do nothing.\" (Dr Aronson wishes to thank those who helped prepare this paper: the staff of the American Academy ofPediatrics, including Sam Flint, Beth Yudkowsky and E Edwards Rushton; Birt Harvey, a former presi-dent of the AAP; Frances Gill, a pediatrician and director of primaty pediatric services for TheChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia; and her husband, Jerold Aronson, president of the Pennsylvaniachapter of AAP and a consultant on child health care organization and financing) 172u REFERENCES 1.Green M, ed. 1994.

BEST COPY AVAILABLE CHIPA Community Modelfor a Comprehensive Health Care System INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW rfhe Child Health Investment Partnership (CHIP) is a public-private partnership providing asystem of health care delivery to medically underserved children in Virginia's Roanoke Valleyand in eight communities throughout the state. The partnership's mission is to promote the health ofchildren and strengthen their families by using a mix of public and private resources to ensure acommunity-based system of primary heath care, care coordination, and family support.CHIP was established in 1988 to address weaknesses in Roanoke's primary care system for youngchildren. At the time of CHIP's inception (1987), 27 percent of children ages birth to six years (4,800children) were living in families with incomes below 150 percent of the federal poverty level. Having byPeggy Balla, R.N., M.PH. 202 a Medicaid card was not an adequate solution for ensuring that children in poverty would receivehealth care. Only one out of 16 pediatricians accepted new Medicaid patients, and family practicephysicians generally limited the number of Medicaid patients per month they accepted into theirpractices (if they accepted them at all). Low Medicaid reimbursement rates were cited as the primaryreason for not accepting these.patients. In the public sector, health departments offered only well-child services on a limited basis, and theabsence of 24-hour coverage led to inappropriate use of emergency rooms as a source of primarycare. The hospital clinic held four half-day clinics, and, like the health department, lacked 24-hourcoverage. Immunization rates in the area for two-year-olds were only 52 percent. Additionally, therewas a lack of coordination and outreach between public and private services and programs such asthe Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC), immunizationclinics, and mental health and social services. Fragmentation, duplication, and delivery of care ininappropriate settings (or not at all) were the major concerns echoed early in CHIP's development.Setting the StageA group of health leaders with firsthand knowledge of the deficiencies in the system convened ameeting in Roanoke in May 1987. In attendance were private physicians, public health directors, astate senator, local community action agency staff, the Virginia Commissioner of Health, chairs ofpediatrics departments in Virginia's three medical schools, and others knowledgeable in the area ofhealth care. The philosophy and ideas that were to become the key elements of CHIP were developedat this meeting. A task force was formed to further refine the ideas and build them into a working model. CHIP waslaunched in 1988 as a public-private partnership with initial funding from the Maternal and ChildHealth Block Gram. The W. K. Kellogg Foundation was so intrigued by the model that it granted CHIP$1.5 million in support for its first three years of existence. CHIP is now incorporated as a 501(c)3organization. A board of directors with wide community and corporate representation oversees ti,eorganizat ion. 1762u3 After funding CHIP of Roanoke, the W. K. Kellogg Foundation awarded a second grant in order toreplicate the program model in other communities in the state, beginning iii July 1990. The goal ofthis expansion project, known as CHIP of Virginia, is to establish a statewide network of community-based projects offering comprehensive health care to children of low-income status and multiple sup-port services to their families. The expansion program has retained the concept of the public-privatepartnership with three participating partners: community action agencies, health departments, andprivate physicians and dentists. Because each site has a unique combination of demographics andresources, organizati't structures may vary, although program components do not. The CHIP ModelCHIP models a family-centered system of care at the communitylevel that ensures a broad range ofavailable and accessible services for the target population. Comprehensiveness, coordination, and con-tinuity are emphasized in the CHIP framework. The founders recognized that medical care was onlyone facet in making a difference in the health status of these children. The definition of health withinthe CHIP model is linked to the environment, prevention, primary care, and coordination of servicessuch as transportation, housing, nutrition, mental and physical health, and to other social supports. The CHIP model has three basic components: providing care coordination, facilitating children'saccess to primary health care services, and providing family support services. CHIP creates a \"medical home\" for each child by designating a local private physician to care for thechild. Within this medical home, the child has access to regular and continuous medical care 24hours a day. Public health nurses provide care coordination services, through which CHIP staff estab-lish and implement a comprehensive health care plan for each child in the program. Furthermore,families in the CHIP program receive support services such as parenting, health and nutrition educa-tion, and transportation to appropriate services. The public health nurse and home visitor worktogether to coordinate care and deliver services to the child and family. All children are referred to alocally based singlc point of entry. Public health nurses and home visitors conduct family-orientedchild assessments and make referrals to an integrated network of services. 177I_i', AU `.1 CHIP targets services to children, ages birth to six years, whose family income is below 133 percent ofthe poverty level at the time of enrollment, and below 150 percent at recertification each year there-after. Each year since CHIP's inception, the upper age limit has been extended by one year so that anenrolled child does not lose eligibility because of age. CHIP serves the cities of Roanoke and Salemand three surrounding counties. The area comprises 1,100 square miles and represents urban, rural,and suburban populations; 67 percent of the children being served reside in the city of Roanoke. LOCAL SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT Facilitating Local Planning and ActionCHIP fosters the process through which system development can occur. Drawing on the Roanokeexperience, increasing or enhancing the community's capacity to promote access to health carewithin the CHIP framework has occurred in several stages. These have been translated into the fol-lowing strategies in the replication effort: (1) building interorganizational partnerships within localcommunities including the private medical sector; (2) developing and maintaining responsiveness tolocal needs; and (3) cultivating resource development by finding or creatively combining channels offunding. Strategy #1: Building partnerships.The public-private partnership approach is the cornerstone of CHIP. The Roanoke model reflects atrue grassroots approach, while the CHIP of Virginia sites are really hybrids in which the basic pro-ject framework is provided to localities in general terms, allowing for considerable flexibility andvariability at the local level. Based on the Roanoke experience, development of CHIP partnerships requires that participants meetcertain conditions: collaboration, leadership, and clear vision. First, the partners must be willing tocollaborate (i.e., share resources, creak. a shared vision, and share in the solutions and the successes). 178205 Development of local CHIP partnerships initially includes three key participantsthe local healthdepartment, the community action agency, and the private medical community. A principal strategyfor revising frontline service delivery focuses on convening leaders who represent these three keyparticipants.The second condition is leadership. Building the partnership means selecting participants with thepower and authority to effect change and open doors in the community. CHIP of Virginia, in replicat-ing the initial Roanoke model, uses basic principles of community action, capitalizing on the localand state networks of providers and professional organizationleaders in nursing, medicine, public health, and communityaction in order to identify and cultivate leadership within corn- The second condition ismunities. Typically, local advisory boards include health direc- leadership. Building thetors and directors of public health nursing, executive directors partnership meansof community action agencies, and leaders within the local selecting participants withpediatric and family practice community. Thus, the CHIP the power and authority toprocess bridges the gaps that exist with respect to the visions of effect change and openestablishedhealthproviders(includingpublichealthdoors in the community. providers), other community agencies, and consumers. Indeveloping and implementing the partnership, it is importantto include agency staff at several levels throughout the partner agenciesby integrating support andparticipation at different levels, the partnership has a much better chance of survival, should the topleadership suddenly change. The third condition involves clarity of vision. To guide development, attention must be given to artic-ulating a clear mission and clearly identifying the population to be served. CHIP'S target populationcomprises children ages birth to six years from families below a defined income level, regardless oftheir insurance status. Serving this population also includes working together to integrate health andsocial services, paying particular attention to the social contributors to ill health. Completing a com-munity needs assessment that contains basic demographic information as well as an assessment of 179206 community services and resources forms an important basis for tailoring CHIP to the needs of a par-ticular community. Families are encouraged to express their views, thus providing further insightinto the needs of the community. Strategy #2: Maintaining responsiveness to the community.The second strategy is to maintain responsiveness to local community needs. Thus far, the CHIPexperience finds the following factors to be of great importance in maintaining responsiveness:(1) commitment of leaders; (2) local autonomy and control; (3) the ability to communicate effec-tively to solve problems; and (4) the capacity for supportive data linkage systems. CHIP works to ensure community responsiveness and develop the capacity to meet the needs of thepopulation by reaching out simultaneously to those within as well as those outside mainstreamhealth, education, and social services and to include religious, business, and civic communities. Thisrequires committed leaders who are willing to devote their time andDevelopment ofpartnerships inherentlyinvolves altering deeplyentrenched patterns ofinteractions betweentraditiondl serviceproviders.energy to bring together a seemingly disparate group. It also requiresleaders who remain committed for an extended period of time.Those involved with CHIP of Roanoke in 1988 are still active today. Development of partnerships inherently involves altering deeplyentrenched patterns of interactions between traditional serviceproviders. Turf issues have existed and undoubtedly will surfaceagain as CHIP continues to evolve. Addressing turf issues is vitallyimportant to ensuring success. Taking risks, trusting other agencies,and remaining focused on a shared vision has enabled CHIP to suc-ceed. The technical assistance and guidance provided to the developing CHIP sites focuses onenabling institutions that serve the same families to solve common problems. As the cross-site eval-uation of CHIP moves fomard, we must wait for the results of the impact of local factors on pro-gram development. 180 Community-based policies need to be locally driven. Autonomy and control at the local level fosterthe sharing of accumulated learning that the partners bring to CHIP. This allows the emerging systemto be more responsive to contextual changes and implementation issues within the community andto resolve problems and concerns more quickly than within the confines of an established bureau-cratic entity. Remaining responsive to a community's needs also requires developing the capacity for supportivedata systems and information system linkages. The impact of the project must be demonstrated tofunders, to the community, and to staff. Linking data systems with providers and agencies is difficultto achieve but is essential to demonstrating the results in terms of outcomes. Concern about confi-dentiality is an important issue that still needs to be resolved at CHIP. Currently, CHIP's data systemis linked with the health department, and providers under contract send copies to CHIP of allencounters with children served by the project. Linkage of data systems with agencies such as socialservices remains a long-range goal. Strategy #3: Financing the effort.The third strategy for increasing system capacityand one of the most criticalis funding.Ultimately, the availability of funding determines whether the revised services delivery structure willbecome widely implemented and permanently established and also determines the size of the popu-lation that can be served effectively. Like many other innovative ventures, CHIP has had to find piece-meal funding in order to transform a piecemeal health care system for children and families into acoherent one. The most important lesson gleaned from project experience is not to be bound by atask orientation to funding sources. Thus far, in the absence of a stable funding base, a creative mix ofpublic and private funding sources has meant survival for CHIP The Roanoke project is a good example of the collaborative approach and its importance to resourcedevelopment at the local level. In Roanoke, the first step was to ensure that services were not beingduplicated. Broad-based community support and representation on the board of directors of the 181208 Roanoke project has been essential in developing a system that has maximized the use of existingresources. Involving the corporate sector yields benefits that include an increased awareness of childhealth issues, financial support (including in-kind support), and an entry into segments of the com-munity that may be unknown to those in the medical profession. Corporate leadership on the pro-ject's boIrd of directors has helped promote fiscal accountability and has led to the creation of abusiness plan to guide development activities. One notable example of this type of support for CHIPis the establishment of a permanent fundraiser supported by Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Evaluating therole of private sector fundraising is being monitored closely by all involved in this effort. Funding for CHIP of Roanoke is a mix of public and private money. Currently, public funding consti-tutes 50 percent of the project's $800,000 budget, from sources including the Maternal and ChildHealth Block Grant, local governments, and Medicaid revenue for expanded services such as casemanagement and transportation. Local government funding, which plays an important role in theproject, is assured through the commitment and leadership of the CHIP partners. Private sources offundingcorporate and individual donations and private foundationscomprise the other 50 per-cent of the Roanoke project's budget. Medicaid, the main source of funding for the primary health care of children enrolled in CHIP, plays asignificant role in the project. Currently, 85 percent of children in Roanoke are enrolled in Medicaidand that figure approaches 100 percent in the replicate sites. CHIP has not yet found Medicaid to be asubstantial source of revenue for the case management services provided by the public health nurses. Statewide, new funding streams are continually being sought; recently, CHIP of Virginia (the replica-tion effort) was owarded a Family Resource grant of $4.5 million from the Administration onChildren and Famhies, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, to support and expand pro-ject services across the state. The challenge is to find permanent funding channels and predictablelevels of support on a continuing basis to enable long-term planning for service delivery. CHIP isworking with key leaders and the business and medical community in the state to advance a legisla-tive mandate to sustain the project. 182209 Private Medical Sector ParticipationThirty-two pediatricians and family practice physicians from nine private practices provide the pri-mary health care for children enrolled in the project. The strength of the CHIP model is that theenrolled child has the benefit of a primary care provider on a continuous basis. Private medical sec-tor participation can be credited largely to the involvement of the medical community in planningand implementation of the project at the local level. Physician participation on local advisory boardsdevelops the practitioner's awareness of community need, provides a forum for exchanging informa-tion with others involved in delivering health care (such as public health providers), and establishes ameans of expressing concerns and solving problems concerning the provision of primary care. A 1991 Virginia Polytechnic Institute study of medical sector participation of CHIP providers foundthat physicians were \"hard pressed\" to find weaknesses with the program; most physicians, in fact,did not report any weaknesses, but enumerated a number of strengths, including completed healthhistories, up-to-date immunizations, good continuity of care, a medical home, improved appoint-ment compliance, and family involvement. Practitioners typically report that it is difficult to uncoverfactors that may affect health outcomes in office-based pradices that are becoming increasingly bur-dened with the advent of managed care in the Roanoke Valley. A powerful incentive for CHIP involvement cited.by the majority of participating physicians is therange of comprehensive services provided by the project, largely through care coordination activitiesby public health nurses. These care coordination activities augment the services provided by physi-cians in private practice. The public health nurses coordinate treatment plans when appropriate andhelp manage the social/economic barriers that may impede resolution of health care problems. Thenurses assess the child within the context of the family and focus on preventiontracking andreminding parents when the next immunization, dental, or well-child check-up is due, making refer-rals to resources such as WIC, or facilitating parent classes. Home visitors conduct family needsassessments and follow up on missed appointments. These services help to improve family compli-ance as well as reliance on the physician as the child's medical home, and result in increased satisfac-tion for both the family and the CHIP provider. 183210 STATEWIDE INITIATIVES CHIP staff remain informed of and involved in statewide changes and initiatives that affect the healthof children and families. Many of the needs across the state affect the development of new CHIP sites.In Virginia today, there are 1 million uninsured citizens. Sixty percent of all counties fall below thenationally recognized standard to ensure adequate primary health care (i.e., one primary care physi-cian per 2,500 people). More than one-third of all Virginia counties are officially designated as med-ically underserved communities or health personnel shortage areas. Several initiatives have been enacted to meet the challenge of ensuring adequate capacity for primaryhealth care. Four years ago, the state passed a resolution (SJR 179) authorizing local health depart-ments to assess the primary care needs of populations within their jurisdictions; these assessmentsidentified weaknesses in the primary care system throughout the state. During the same period, then-Governor L. Douglas Wilder created a task force to address the pri-mary heath care needs of children. A final report, published in 1991, contained recommendationsfor a package of primary and preventive care for children. In addition, other initiatives included (1)forming the Virginia Health Care Foundation (1992) to promote cooperative primary health careinitiatives involving public-private partnerships across the state; (2) supporting the 1994 VirginiaGeneralists Initiative to ensure that 50 percent of Virginia's medical school graduates enter generalpractice by the year 2000; and (3) establishing the Virginia Area Health Education Centers in 1991. The CHIP Statewide Coordinating Council was formed in 1990, when the $2.3 million replicationgrant was awarded by the W. K. Kellogg Foundation. Council representation reflects the local com-munities, with representation from medical education, professional organizations, communityaction, public health, Medicaid, and private insurers. The council advises on project implementationstatewide, and exerts considerable influence in helping to permanently establish the modelstatewide. CROSS-PROJECT EVALUATION Evaluation of the Roanoke model program and the first three CHIP of Virginia replication sites(Abingdon, Charlottesville, and Richmond) is under way. The principal investigator is LorraineKlerman, Dr.P.H., M.P.H., of the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Public Health. MaryRogers, Dr.P.H., M.P.H., also of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, serves as project directorfor the evaluation. The evaluation plan encompasses three phases. Phase I: Developing a data collection system for CHIP Roanoke and the replication sites.This data system would describe:The number of children and families enrolled;The number and type of medical and dental encounters;The number and type of public health nurse encounters and family intervention spe-cialist encounters;The sociodemographic and health characteristics of families; andThe cost of the projects (Roanoke model and replication sites).Phase II: Designing and implementing a process evaluation of the replication sites.The overall goal of the process evaluation is to determine whether CHIP programs in the replicationsites are operating in ways that will make it possible to meet primary objectives of the project: \"Tobuild and maintain a network of local/private partnerships to improve the health status of youngchildren to enhance each participating family's ability to move towards self-sufficiency.\" The processevaluation is designed as a formative evaluation and the information obtained will provide feedbackto help monitor current implementation and expansion to additional sites.Phase III: Developing a design for a prospective evaluation of at least five CHIP sites (fourreplication sites and the Roanoke model).Planning and design for the prospective evaluation of CHIP began in January 1994. This phase willuse the data collection systems and lessons learned from the previous phases of the evaluation. The 1850 1 n1.# A. 4, prospective evaluation will be a long-term study in which at least two years of data will be collectedand analyzed. Medical and dental utilization and diagnosis data will he collected from Medicaid data tapes. Thesetapes contain the information used by the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services totrack health care services to Medicaid recipients and to bill providers at standard Medicaidreimbursement rates. The tapes also capture hospitalizations and emergency room utilization forMedicaid-enrolled children. For strict confidentiality, all names and other personal identifiers will beremoved before data are sent to.the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Medical and dental coverage for children in low-income families is changing with the advent ofVirginia's Kids Care program and with Blue Cross/Blue Shield's Caring program. CHIP replicationsites and the Roanoke model are actively seeking partnerships with these programs so that childrenwho are not eligible for Medicaid can be enrolled in local CHIP programs with assurance ofreimbursement for CHIP medical and dental providers. Blue Cross/Blue Shield may also provideaccess to medical and dental utilization data through their management information systems. CONCLUSION CI HP continues to evolve and to exert positive influence on local and state systems of health care foryoung children. In the shadow of health care reform, CHIP is searching for ways to fit into the \"bigpicture:' It is important to keep in mind that whatever emerges from the health care deliberations offederal pohcymakers, implementation will occur at the local level. Meaningful involvement of allstakeholders in needs assessments, planning, and implementation has made CHIP successful, andthe experience demonstrates that meaningful change can occur with committed leadership fromcommunities. 1862 3 Pediatric Primary Care Systems DevelopmentInitiatives in Arizona The responsibility for assuring that all of Arizona's children have access to and utilize primary care services was introduced in the late 1980s with the special set-aside funding through the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, and was formalized with the passage and implementation of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89). The purpose of this paper is to describe how the Arizona Department of Health Services has attempted to address this challenge. It includes a description of the state of Arizona within the context of service delivery, a bit of history in relation to primary care, a description of the planning process used, and the resulting strategies and programs.Arizona is typical of many western states. Geographically, it is a large state with broad expanses of uninhabited land. Arizona, however, is an urban state, with almost 80 percent of its pop- byJane Pearson, R.N.2 ulation residing in three urban areas. The state's population is fairly ethnically diverse: 27 percent ofArizona's children are Hispanic, 4 percent are African American, and 8 percent are Native American.A total of 22 Indian tribes live on reservations in Arizona. Most Native Americans are served by theIndian Health Service or by a tribal health department. Fifteen autonomous county health depart-ments provide many typical services such as sanitation, disease control, immunizations, and com-munity nursing. These county health departments, for the most part, are not primary care providers. Arizona's Medicaid system consists entirely of managed care. Almost all of the system is privatized,and county health departments are not Medicaid providers. The Medicaid system is administered bya state agency specifically created for that purpose. All persons enrolled in the state's Medicaid sys-tem select or are assigned a health plan and a primary care provider. The number of plans variesfrom year to year depending on the number of proposals submitted and the actual \"bid.\" THE CHALLENGE FOR ARIZONA'S MCH PROGRAM:WHERE TO BEGIN? The challenge faced by Arizona's MCH program was similar to the challenge facing many states:\"Where in the world do we begin?\" The first task was to determine what was happeningsomewould call it a needs assessment. The Department of Health Services MCH program used the set-aside funding from the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau to conduct a survey to determineutilization of primary health care. It was discovered that all of Arizona's children were faring poorly;there were no significant differences based on income levels or insurance coverage. In fact, the great-est predictor of utilization was whether the family had a usual source of care. With this information and a knowledge of the state's service delivery systems, the next step was todevelop a plan. This is where the serious struggle began. Several things worked in our favor. We had 188 examples of \"systems\" that integrated private and public sectors, various payors, and various deliverymodels to address the needs of specific populations successfully. The private and public sectors workwell together. Within the Department of Health Services, Office of Maternal and Child Health, therewas general agreement that the focus for assuring primary care for children would be at the commu-nity level, and we were reasonably certain that what might work for one community might not be asuccessful strategy in another. On the other hand, it was unclearwhat \"primary care\" should include, or what the \"system\" should One of the majorlook like. It was sort of like making a chocolate chip cookie with- interventions emergingout ever having baked one before and without having a recipe.We from community planningnot only didn't know the recipe, we couldn't find anyone else who is the school-based or did. We vacillated between trying to figure out what to do and school-linked clinic. doing\"something\"and finally decided to try \"something.\" The first attempt involved contracting with three communityagencies to develop and implement a plan for primary care for their community. The idea was to usea community development process 'to develop the plan. It was a learning experience. We didn't knowwhat we really wanted these community agencies to doexcept to assure that all children had amedical home. So the agencies were not given much direction. Since each of the contractors was acommunity agency, it was assumed that each knew how to \"do\" community development. This wasnot the case. Then it was discovered that staff within the state Office of Maternal and Child Health didnot have the skills needed to provide technical assistance. It was a frustrating experience for all. In 1992, the Department of Health Services decided to begin again. Many people at the national levelhad been working on the issue of primary care, so more resources were available. In addition, theMaternal and Child Health Bureau had published a definition of primary care, and Dr. BarbaraStarfield had developed a model that defined the attributes of primary care and identified the struc-ture and process characteristics of a primary care system. 189 TASK FORCE OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES With those resources as a guide, a statewide task force was created to mobilize state agencies andcommunity representatives to develop a comprehensive plan that would ensure coordination of pri-mary care services. The task force, by design, represented the broadest membership including thehealth community, education community, business community, health care financiers, consumers,rural communities, and urban communities. The task force focused on developing the concept for astatewide system, planning objectives and strategies for action, and building consensus among publicand private sectors. The goal was to provide the Arizona. Department of Health Services with recommendations fordesigning a system to ensure that all children have access to and utilize primary health care. This sys-tem must be family centered and community based, and must meet primary care needs as well asspecial health needs for children and their families. The task force identified three objectives: I.Develop and promote a common definition of primary care;2.Formulate statewide policies that support universal accessibility and utilization ofservices; and3.Activate strategies that assure implementation of statewide policies, including theneed to measure how well the system or systems are currently meeting the definitionof primary care. The task force defined primary care as follows: Primary care fir children and adolescents is a personal health care service that is delivered in thecontext offamily and community. It is comprehensive in scope and includes services that preservehealth, prevent disease and dysfunction, and care for common illnesses and disabilities. Primarycare is the usual point of entry to the personal health care system. 190 Task force outcomes include a blueprint, marketing plan, community development efforts, variousoptions for service delivery, and increased training and technical assistance. A brief description ofthese efforts follows. The task force was instrumental in defining the model of primary care in the state. It was a challengeto understand how the attributes were to be applied and how one model could respond to the needsof every community. After considerable debate within the task force and Office of Maternal and ChildHealth staff, the idea of a blueprint was developed. The task force used the example of an architec-tural model, in which a standard blueprint would be developed for a three-bedroom, two-bathroomhouse; many people might have the same blueprint but their houses would all look different depend-ing on the tastes and needs of the individual families. This blueprint concept also would hold true fora primary care system at the community level. The job of the task force was to develop the blueprintthat a community would use as the basis for its own system. This seemed like a relatively simple con-cept, but it was a major accomplishment for both the task force and MCH staff. It helped everyoneunderstand how to develop a primary care system. The second outcome of the task force was the creation of a committee to develop and implement amarketing plan. No one on the task force knew much about marketing, so members contacted thecollege of business at one of the universities and arranged foi- a graduate student in marketing towork as an intern to help the subcommittee develop the marketing plan. The plan was to be pilottested in two \"typical\" Arizona communities in 1994. The committee continues to be very involved inthis activity, and the intern extremely valuable in providing the staffing and technical assistance tothe committee. Apparently, the internship also is an excellent experience for the students becauseeach semester brings increasing competition for the assignment; the current intern assumes respon-sibility for recruiting the successor.The third outcome of the task force involves an increase in community development efforts. TheDepartment of Health Services is committed to the concept that communities are the best resourcefor effecting system change, and thus initiated local planning grants. Planning grants ei $5,000 each 191Ao_LO have betn awarded to 15 local agencies to develop primary care systems for their communities. Localgrantees must use a community development model to develop the.plan, which must include anassessment based on the primary care attributes, an intervention plan, and a financing plan. Most ofthe contractors are schools, school districts, or county health departments. Some of the contractorsare in the intervention stage and all have acquired financing from the community. The task force's fourth outcome was identification of a variety of service delivery options. To date,there are at least five options, and presumably there will be more. One of the major interventionsemerging from community planning is the school-based or school-linked clinic. A few years ago, thisoption would not have been considered; now these clinics are beingA number of programsmay be effective inthemselves, but do system forthe state's population ofchildren? This is clearlythe next challenge. teer provider. The program isfinanced through a variety of mechanisms such as fee for service,grants, and foundation support. Another service delivery option is the Medical Home Program, acollaborative effort between the Arizona Chapter of the AmericanAcademy 'of Pediatrics and the Department of Health Services. Thebasic concept of the program is to match pediatricians and familypractice physicians with a school in their neighborhood. The physi-cian agrees to provide primary care for a certain number of chil-dren. The school nurse identifies children without a primary careprovider and without insurance and matches a child with a volun-being pilot tested in an urban community but other school districtsand providers have shown a great deal of interest in the program. A third option is the Passport Project, targeting the newborn population. This concept involves aparent-held medical record with a tracking system included. The Office of Women's and Children'sHealth has been working with Dr. William Frankenberg in the development of the \"passport?' Community-based outreach piograms and nurse practitioner clinics complete the primary care ser-vice delivery options currently operating in Arizona. The community-based outreach uses lay work- : 0192 ers to assist families in gaining access to primary care in their neighborhood or community. Thenurse practitioner clinic is a free-standing clinic in an underserved area, with oversight provided by auniversity college of nursing. Each of these may grow in appeal with the advent of health care reform. All of these task force activities have generated an increasing need for consultation, training, andtechnical assistance within communities. Therefore, the Office of Women's and Children's Health hasdeveloped the capacity to provide consultation and technical assistance, including training, in the fol-lowing areas: community development, school-based clinics, contracting processes, sustaining offunding and marketing, and the medical home program. We have trained a number of our staff toprovide consultation on community development, using existing materials from the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention and other sources. Consultation and technical assistance have been critical for the development of school-based clinics.Technical assistance includes a range of information about issues such as licensing requirements,staffing requirements, and financing mechanisms. Technical assistance is provided to individualschools or agencies. Monthly meetings are held so individuals involved with the development of clin-ics can share information and successes. The medical home training project, a joint effort of theOffice of Women's and Children's Health and the Arizona Chapter of the American Academy ofPediatrics, is provided to interested primary care providers regionally throughout the state. CONCLUSION It is apparent that a great deal of activity surrounds the issue of primary care for children in Arizona.In fact, there is so much excitement in the state that it is hard to keep up with it. One of the mostexciting results is the change in the \"culture\" of the Office of Women's and Children's Health. Althoughthis paper presents only a partial listing of primary care activities and programs in the state, theOffice of Women's and Children's Health has integrated within virtually all of its programs the con-cern that all of Arizona's women and children have access to and utilize primary care. 193rjnAv With all of these efforts, a clear need for evaluation exists. Evaluation needs to occur on at least twolevels. The first focuses on the individual strategy level. Therefore, each of the projects or programslisted above has (or will have) an evaluation component. Second, there must be evaluation on thesystem level. Returning to my earlier metaphor, the question is \"Do we have a chocolate chipcookie?\" A number of programs may be effective in themselves, but do they change the system forthe state's population of children? This is clearly the next challenge. Any advice, directionandhelpare welcomed! 194 Health Care Reformand Public Health Considerationsin Alabama INTRODUCTION This paper describes the Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) and its activities pro-viding personal health care in this time of health care reform. This paper focuses specificallyon (1) strategies that ADPH will consider to maximize the opportunities in health care reform tofashion a system supportive of maternal and child health services, and (2) responsibilities for assess-ing the effectiveness of the postreform system. Certain aspects of this discussion at the time of theApril 1994 workshop have evolved in meaning, as the assumption of universal coverage throughnational health care reform legislation was not realized during the 103rd Congress. Without universalcoverage, it simply may not be feasible for public health agencies providing personal health services to byLarry Menefee, J.D., M.P.H. cease doing so. With erosion of public programs, monitoring the effectiveness of the reformed healthcare system becomes even more vital. The substantive portion of this discussion considers publichealth in relation to the developments of managed care in the private sector, and that discussionremains at the core of reformsboth before and after the 103rd Congress. The Alabama Department of Public Health is not part of the Governor's cabinet; it is an independentstate agency, governed by the 16-member State Committee of Public Health. Twelve of the membersare elected by the Medical Association of the State of Alabama, and four are selected by health-relatedcommittees. The Alabama Department of Public Health is typical of health departments in someother states (particularly in the South) that provide a substantial portion of personal health ser-vices. Provision of personal health services by ADPH, however, poses an institutional dilemma. Thesignificant increase in provision of personal health services by ADPH during the past decade resultsfrom the increased need for those services within the population, increased sensitivity to previouslyunmet needs for such services, and available reimbursement. Consequently, the departmentexpanded significantly, developing the facilities, staff, and expertise to deliver the needed services. The department's current structure depends to a great extent upon the revenue realized from the pro-vision of personal health services, and this revenue is used to subsidize core public health functions.Thus, Alabama's health care system is heavily dependent upon the nature and extent of the servicesprovided by ADPH. While the department and other providers serving low-income and uninsuredpopulations have developed specialized capacities and skills to serve the special needs of these popu-lations, private sector providers have not. Examples of this specialized care developed in the publicsector (and not normally found in the private sector) include extensive use of social work and carecoordination assistance for patients, near \"monopolization\" of provision of care for tuberculosis, anddominance in care for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV-affected pregnancies.Alabama may be somewhat unique among the states in that its health care reform task force ishoused in the public health agency. In most states, a task force or commission has been appointed bythe legislature or governor. For reasons described in more detail below, the Governor of Alabamaasked the State Committee of Public Health to make recommendations concerning how the state 1960 - ,. should respond to federal initiatives on health care reform proposed in 1994. The State Committee ofPublic Health selected a diverse 80-member task force operating through six subcommittees to studythe issues and make recommendations. The diversity and credibility of the task force members andthe relatively independent and nonpartisan nature of ADPH offers some hope that the Health CareReform Task Force recommendations, when presented, will be seriously considered by the Governorand legislature. This paper addresses two principal themes: (1) how to transform the state's current two-tiered sys-tem of health care into a system that provides significantly stronger primary care services and neces-sary access, and (2) how to transform the activities of ADPH to complement and support thereformed health care system. Thus, we need to imagine not only the reformed health care system wedesire but also the role that ADPH would play in that reformed system. Equally important are thetransition questions. There is a real downside risk that, with financial access assured and/or signifi-cantly increased reliance on managed care delivery arrangements, some public sector providerswould cease to provide services. This would result in a health care system with diminished capacityjust as demand and financial access increase. There is significant philosophical sentiment that thegovernment should not provide health care services to those with the financial ability to obtain ser-vices in the private sector. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS PROVIDEROF PERSONAL HEALTH SERVICES For years, most health departments have provided some personal health services; however, ;lie ser-vices provided by A DPH have increased tremendously during recent years. The following demo-graphic data provide context for the discussion. Alabama has a population of about 4.1 millionpersons, with about 62,000 births annually, and an overall infant mortality rate of 10.5 deaths per1,000 live births. Approximately 25 percent of the state's population is African American, and signifi-cant racial inequality persists. The infant mortality rate is 15.8 for African American infants and 7.5 19702 4 for white infantsa relative risk of 2 to 1. This racial disparity is prevalent throughout all socio-economic indicators. African American residents of Alabama are 75 percent more likely to be withouthealth insurance than white Alabamians. Because of relatively high rates of uninsured populationsand relatively low levels of personal income, and because of significant disparity in health careresources between a sophisticated medical community such as Birmingham and the minimal med-ical resources in some of the poorest rural counties, Alabamians spend the sixth highest percentageof income on health care of any state in the country. The Alabama Department of Public Health operates 89 clinics, with at least one clinic in each of thestate's 67 counties. These clinics offer a variety of personal health services for specified conditions orpopulations, but, with few exceptions, do not offer comprehensive primary care. During fiscal year 1993, the magnitude of these specialized and largely uncoordinated services hasbeen substantial. Maternity care: ADPH served nearly 27,000 maternity patients, averaging 5.9 mater-nity visits per patient, for a total of 159,000 maternity visits during the year. Withapproximately 62,000 births annually, ADPH is serving a little less than half of allmaternity patients in the state. Under contract with the state Medicaid agency, ADPHwas the managed care provider in one-third of the counties, and was responsible(either directly or through subcontractors) for all maternity care for approximately13,000 births.Child health: ADPH served slightly more than 36,000 infants ages birth to one year,and an additional 86,000 children older than one year. The department providednewborn screening for approximately 60,000 babies.Family planning and women's health: ADPH served more than 96,000 women forfamily planning services and screened 82,000 women for breast and cervical cancer.WIC services: The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants andChildren (WIC) provided nutritional assistance to 226,000 Alabama participants 198225 during the year. On a monthly basis, the program served 26,000 pregnant, breast-feeding, or postpartum women, 36,000 infants, and 57,000 children.Home health care: ADPH operates one of the largest home health programs in thecountry, and provided 1.4 million visits to 17,000 clients during the previous year.These data illustrate the services provided to women and children through ADPH and the impor-tance of the revenue generated through these reimbursable services. The department's reliance onrevenue from federally reimbursable services and on federal grants has increased significantly dur-ing the past six years. Health care reform thus poses significant issues for ADPH. Under a health carereform system that would provide health insurance for all citizens, ADPH might cease to provide per-sonal health services and might suffer the subsequent loss of that revenue. Radically rearranged fed-eral financing could significantly change the federal funding channeled to state health departments. As shown in table 1, reimbursable programs accounted for 44.1 percent of revenue during FY 1993,and all other federal programs accounted for 38.9 percent of revenue. However, the six-year periodTable 1 Sources of Revenue FY 1988-93: Alabama Department of Public Health Fiscal Year 1988 Fiscal Year 1993$ MillionReimbursed24.2 199226BEST COPYAVAILABLE shown in table 1 is somewhat misleading with respect to the growth in the state's contribution.During the first year (FY 1988-89), state funding increased by 21 percent; during the last five years(FY 1989-93), state funding increased by only 4 percent. Employment in ADPH increased by 63 per-cent during FY 1989-93, totaling nearly 6,500 employees. (ADPH is the second largest state agency,second only to the state highway department.) Given the relative magnitude of the source of funds, itis fair to ask whether the Alabama Department of Public Health is a state agency or a state-level fed-eral administrative unit. Although the shape of health care reform is far from clear, the above description should help clarifythe difficult issues faced by public health in a reformed health care system. ADPH is a significantprovider of personal health services for women and children, and, to a lesser extent, for the entirepopulation. Currently, the department does not provide a comprehensive and coordinated range ofservices, nor is it likely to provide these services in a reformed health care system. However, ADPHdoes have special experience providing services to the most vulnerable populations. As stated earlier,ADPH is financia4 dependent upon the reimbursable services it provides to patients, in order tosubsidize other core functions of public health.To fulfill the core functions of public healthassessment, policy development, and assurancein areformed health care system, ADPH will have to secure the funding and expertise to meet thedemands of that new system, while adapting many of its personal health service activities in waysthat will continue to serve the population. The transition would be a true metamorphosis and wouldpose significant challenges, but, as part of a full reform of the health care system, it holds the promiseof producing a butterfly. CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF PRIMARY CARE The principal purpose of this paper is not to develop a conceptual model of primary care for womenand children. Nevertheless, examining a conceptual model with its principal components can fosteran understanding of the goals we hope to achieve in a reformed health care system as well as the 200 transition issues that will arise as the health care system changes. A conceptual model provides ablueprint to which we can move existing components of the current health care system or constructnew components for a reformed system. Alabama is in the first year of a thiee-year State Systems Development Initiative for children, devel-oped jointly by ADPH and the Children's Rehabilitation Service of the Department of Education. Thatprocess embraces primary care defined within a framework of 10 attributes: first-contact, continuous,coordinated, comprehensive, community oriented, family centered, accessible, culturally competent,developmentally appropriate, and accountable. Assessing some of these attributes will help determinethe opportunities, roles, and strategies that states might experience with health care reforms. Coordinated care: ADPH employs approximately 150 medical social workersthroughout the state to help patients access other medical care or social welfare ser-vices. Unless integrated service networks or managed care programs develop rapid-ly in all parts of the state (and there are serious reasons to doubt that they will), coor-dinated care will not exist. Even if integrated service networks or managed care pro-grams are developed, they likely will provide coordination of medical care only,whereas most of the population served by ADPH clearly needs care beyond thatdefined in narrow biomedical terms.Comprehensive care: As stated earlier, ADPH does not provide a comprehensiverange of services, nor is it likely to provide those services in a reformed health caresystem. Both the mission of ADPH and the political realities would view any signifi-cant expansion of care as unwarranted competition with private sector efforts.Community-oriented care: Currently, no entity in the state provides true community-oriented primary care. It is doubtful that any entity other than ADPH could providethis facet of primary care to a significant extent. With a few local exceptions, ADPHwould have to provide the resources and leadership if community-oriented care is tobecome part of a reformed health care system. Community-oriented care is particu- larly important for children because they are most affected by certain communityhealth hazards and least able to make their needs known and to have their needs met.Accessible care: AllPH clinics have a mixed score in providing care that is accessibleto patients. Generally, these clinics are more geographically accessible but signifi-cantly less accommodating to client needs than other systems. Specifically, hours ofoperation, appointment systems, telephone services, attractiveness of facilities,provider attitudes, and patient perceptions of quality are all areas that could beimproved through the opportunities of a reformed health care system.Accountable care: More accountable primary care may be the greatest single oppor-tunity offered by a reformed health carc system providing universal financial access.Yet, public health agencies may be no better positioned to champion this attributethan any other provider or institution, given the low level of trust in government gen-erally. With the economic freedom to choose a provider, however, the marketplacemay increase accountability to a level not previously known in our health care sys-tem. Other mechanisms involving the collection, analysis, and publication ofprovider and performance data are definitely needed; multiple avenues and levels ofaccountability, supported by significantly improved data, should be encouraged.These avenues of accountability include, at a minimum, public and democraticprocesses, market mechanisms at both consumer and management levels, and pro-fessional accountability. Mainstreaming the current Medicaid and uninsured populations should open avenues of account-ability through the marketplace that currently do not exist for those patients. Yet, the imperfections ofthe health care marketplace are well known. Steps to ameliorate the imperfections of the marketplaceand to create other avenues of accountability are some of the most important tasks in reforming thehealth care system. 202 0.0 Are TRANSITION ISS4ES: AN OVERVIEW Health care reform with universal coverage and/or increasing use of managed care presents the dualproblem of building a health care delivery system with quantitatively and qualitatively better pri-mary care, and, at the same time, building new capacity forpublic health to perform new or expanded roles in policydevelopment and assessment. On one hand, public health Steps to ameliorate thedepartments may be decreasing their capacity to provide imperfections of the market-personal health care as Medicaid patients are moved into place and to create otherprivate sector managed care organizations; on the other avenues of accountability arehand, they presumably will be expected to expand their some of the most importantcapacity to conduct assessment and policy development, tasks in reforming the healthThis is a difficult balancing act. Without revenue from care system.patient care services, increased funding for core publichealth services probably will be essential. Receivingincreased funding from financially strapped state governments while decreasing the most visible andpolitically prominent services is like sailing upwindit can be done, but careful tacking is required. Transition issues fall into two categories: decreasing the delivery of personal health services, anddeveloping the capacity for assessment and policy development in the reformed system. Both presentsignificant opportunities for improving health and the health care system. This paper focuses pri-marily on thestrategicissues of the transition. Discrete issues about personnel, management struc-ture, physical infrastructure, process, and systems design are crucial to a successful transition but arebeyond 'the scope of this paper (and probably beyond this writer). Transition Issues: Primary Care ServicesFirst, in order to make the transition to a health care system with a strengthened primary care sys-tem, it will be essential to assure that the public health resources already developed are not lost to the health care system. Presumably, there will be pressures to abandon some public clinics and publichospitals or to privatize the system and let the private providers supply the capital to upgrade ormaintain the public system. Although certain parts of our sysitm have excessive capacity, that is nottrue of primary care generally. Decisions to close a.program or facility must, of course, be made withcaution and attention to the individual circumstances. Beyond the minimal position of \"do no harehealth care reform provides the opportunity to convert these public resources creatively into astrengthened primary care system especially well located and experienced in serving the needs oflow-income communities. Issues concerning the transition of these public facilities include (at a minimum) the following: 1.Comprehensiveness of services: To play any significant long-term role in providinghealth care, ADPH clinic sites must offer 6omprehensive service. Expansion of ser-vices is unlikely for both political and financial reasons; however, because of theclient base, some integrated service networks might find ADPH clinic sites attractivein the short term (if utilization could be controlled).2.Quality of services: Although the quality of services provided by ADPH is presumedto be good, few measures of quality exist. ADPH monitors for compliance with fed-eral standards in programs such as family planning; other services are monitored forcompliance using standards developed by ADPH. However, no outcome measures orpatient satisfaction surveys are conducted. It is not clear what protocols and stan-dards would need to change if ADPH clinics become part of an integrated servicenetwork.3.Physical facilities: Many ADPH facilities are in poor physical condition and convey anunattractive institutional appearance. For several years, ADPH has sought (unsuc-cessfully) a $60 million state bond issue to improve local health department facilities.4.Financial management: Financial management for collection from Medicaid hasimproved significantly during recent years. However, experience in billing and col- 204213 1 lecting from other payors is limited, and there is very limited experience with capi-tated reimbursement.5.Management structure: The structure is designed to manage 89 clinics, most ofwhich are small and geographically dispersed. This differs significantly from mostprimary care provider facilities, which are often much larger at individual sites andrelatively compact geographically. Salaries in the public sector, in many instances, arenot competitive with the private sector, and management ability varies considerablyacross the state.6.Public image: As provider of last resort, ADPH has a public image that, while benev-olent, carries a perception of lesser quality, accommodation, and individual atten-tion. However, some of the current clients have a positive perception'and an appreci-ation of the care received from ADPH over many years.Transition Issues: Assessment and Policy DevelopmentThe reformed public health system presumably will be responsible for providing policy develop-ment and assessment. That is the hope and expectation of the public health community, but itremains an open question. Other entities, privle or public, could play significant roles in policydevelopment and assessment. Entities operating in ways similar to the Joint Commission on theAccreditation of Healthcare Organizations, peer review organizations, or professional associationscould claim the responsibility for assessing the quality and effectiveness of a reformed health caresystem. Assessing the reformed health care system will require data collection and analytical abili-ties that are significantly beyond most state government organizations at this time. With anti-gov-ernment, anti-bureaucracy, and anti-regulatory sentiment high in the public consciousness, it isnot clear that ADPH or any other department of state government would be the locus for significantnew assessment responsibilities. Currently. ADPH assessment activities center on vital events and notifiable disease monitoring. Thecapacity to assess these activities differs significantly from the capacity to assess the service, accessi- bility, and effectiveness of various provider health plans. This is not to suggest that the issue of whoshould assess the reformed system is a foregone conclusion. Public trust, lack of self-interest, generalcredibility, institutional stability, and subjugation to the political process will be factors suggestingthat ADPH or some other government entity should perform the assessment. Knowledge of the nec-essary computer capacities is not a significant problem for state governhients, but finding and hiringpersonnel familiar with the needed analysis in the health care field is a very serious problem in-Alabama (and in many other state governments). We believe that development of standardized data sets such as the Health Plan Employer Data andInformation Set (HEMS) or the Workgroup for Electronic Data Interchange (WEDI) will provide thebasis for any significant data collection efforts. HEMS 2.0, for example, specifically includes data onchildhood immunization, cholesterol screening, mammography screening, Pap smears, low birth-weight, prenau I care in first trimester, emergency room visits for asthma, diabetic eye disease, andsubstance abuse readmission rate as qualitative measures for preventive and primary care. MODELS FOR CHANGE This paper presents three models or prototypes for accomplishing the transition of the personalhealth services of ADPH in a reformed health care system. These models are based on the economicmotivation or mission of the principal entities with whom ADPH would work. That distinction ismeaningful for several reasons. As a public entity, ADPII has a primary responsibility to serve thepublic good, and should avoid creating any financial or marketplace windfall for any private entity. I naddition, partnering entities bring varying capabilitie:: and attributes, depending on their economicand organizing characteristics. A description of the three models follows.I. Public model.ADPH could ensure that the availability and quality of its services would be attractive to patients andmanaged care networks in the reformed health care market by taking stone or all of these steps: 206o `:), (a) offering a comprehensive range of primary care services at some or all clinic sites by staffing thesites with physicians and/or nurse practitioners, or improving the accessibility and attractiveness ofthe less comprehensive range of services currently offered; (b) increasing investment in physicalinfrastructure and providing attractive facilities comparable to the private sector; and (c) developingmanagement and personal practices to improve scheduling and waiting times, becoming moreresponsive to patient needs, and handling financial and referral matters at standards comparable tothe private sector. The department would be a primary and active participant in an integrated service network, healthmaintenance organization, or other form of managed care plan. ADPH would actively participate inall of the market developments and compete in that marketplace, perhaps \"specializing\" in the clientgroup geographic areas currently served by the department. However, the political feasibility of thisapproach is slTht or nonexistent and is unlikely to be considered for ideological reasons. 2. Public-private model.ADPH would form partnerships, joint operating agreements, and/or leases with private nonprofit orfor-profit operations. The principal aim would be to continue or to enhance current ADPH serviceswithout additional cost to the department. ADPH could enter into an agreement with a communityhospital, university medical center, federal clinic, or private multispecialty clinic to carry out ADPHclinical operations at one or more sites. The agreement would address staffing, scope of services, andrental payment for facilities. The variety and flexibility of such agreements across the 89 clinic siteswould be considerable and the administrative and legal burden of negotiating the agreements couldbe significant if negotiations were conducted one site at a time. In this model, A Dill would continue to provide some direct care services. ADPH, for example, couldcontract to provide family planning or medical social work support not only at the ADPH clinic(which would be operated by the new A DPH partner) but also at another site (such as a communityhospital) served by the new partner. 2072 3 4 This model presents a number of possible benefits or opportunities, including (1) generating a posi-tive financial return for ADPH through rental fees for its facilities; (2) carefully tailoring the variousclinic sites to become integral parts of the primary care system; (3) negotiating the contributions ofother parties to an improved system of primary care; and (4) assuring continuity of care throughprovision of services at the same facility by many of theAssuming the best with respectto managed competition, wemight expect that a better-organized system of primarycare will emerge from themarket forces and businessinterests already quite activein the system.same care providers, and thereby increasing the possibil-ity of providing ancillary services (such as WIC services)at one location. In addition, other entities can quickly bring some bene-fits to the system that otherwise might take ADPH sometime to accomplish. A partner having a reputation iden-tified with high-quality care, for example, could helpcement patient loyalty rapidly. A partner with solid man-agement experience in patient scheduling, billing, andcollecting could be utilized quickly in ADPH clinics.Even improvement to the facilities could be accomplished quickly if negotiated as part of the agree-ment. Most other entities could move more rapidly than the state to contract for renovation andexpend funds. 3. Privatization model.In this model, ADPH and its facilities would no longer play a role in providing direct personal healthcare. However, to facilitate patient referrals, the transition of personal health care services from thepublic to the private domain should entail agreements or more informal understandings with otherarea providers who will be offering the services formerly provided by the department. ADPH facili-ties mit;ht be sokl to other entities, and the terms of the sale might require assurance that primarycare operations be continued for a certain period of time. Given the large and increasing number ofuninsured, this model may not be possible for a large personal health care provider such as ADPH. 208 The disadvantage of this model is the department's loss of capacity to deliver services. If other enti-ties come forward to provide those services, the public does not perceive a loss. However, failure ofsome of the new or expanded entities could result in diminished system capacity. Another disadvan-tage is that ADPH, once removed from the system, loses the ability to influence continued develop-ment of a good primary health care system except by direct regulation via the tools of the core publichealth functions. Remaining an active player in the systeM (as envisioned in the first two models) would allow ADPHto continue to negotiate and influence the development of the primary care system. The policy toolof being a player in the market may well be stronger than any regulatory tool given ADPH in areformed system. After all, most reform proposals rely principally on market models. Regulatorytools presumably would be relatively weak (and it is not certain what regulatory responsibilitiesmight be given to ADPH). CONCLUSION A reformed health care system provides great opportunities to develop a much stronger primary caresystem. The transition, if it is to improve the system, will be difficult to accomplish in Alabama, how-ever. It will require not only exceptionally clear vision of the goal but also the constant attention andsupporting information needed to attain the goal. Assuming the best with respect to managed com-petition and a greatly expanded managed care environment, we might expect that a better-organizedsystem of primary care will emerge from the market forces and business interests already quite activein the system. We could believe, then, that most citizens will experience better primary care. However, the popula-tions that are vulnerable, because of both geographic location and personal characteristics, may notbenefit nearly so well by managed competition. I remain skeptical about the ability of market forcesto serve those patients. The Alabama Department of Public Health brings to the table not only a 209 statewide network of clinics serving a significant portion of the population but also valuable knowl-edge about serving the special needs of that population. If those advantages are used along withappropriate regulatory authority and accompanying financial support to carry out the core publichealth functions, there is a good chance we could have a significantly improved primary care systemas part of a reformed health care system. You may wonder when I am going to say anything about the other half of the transition for ADPHthat is, developing funding to carry out the core public health functions after funds from providingpersonal health services are reduced or eliminated. The short answer is that I do not know theanswer. There are several significant unknown factors at this time: the extent of the increasedresponsibilities and funds required, the amount of funding lost if ADPH ceases to provide personalhealth services to Medicaid recipients, and the design of the reformed system. I offer two observations. First, significantly increased direct funding from either federal or state gov-ernment is problematic. Without legislative attention to the role of public health in a reformed sys-tem, health care reform becomes particularly hazardous for ADPH. Second, depending on the shape of reform and the responsibilities of public health, there is a poten-tial source of politically feasible funding for public health in a reformed system. If reform includessignificant use of purchasing alliances or pools, it is reasonable to fund some public health activitiesout of those monies. Funding part of public health in this way may be both good politics and soundpolicy, given the magnitude of the funds that could be involved in the purchasing pools, the off-budget nature of these purchasing pools, and th, ively small amount of funding for publichealth. A small portion of those funds paid to pith, ...alth to support the most basic type of envi-ronmental and community health could be a significant help in funding those operations. That alsomoves us toward a more unified financing of health, and places in perspective the small amount offunds needed for the very large cost benefits of public health. Clearly, public health departments that provide substantial personal health services to Nledicaid-eligible patients bear a significant risk, since those patients may be moved into private managed care 210 operations (resulting in a withdrawal of the revenue stream from public health). Without new rev-enue, public health's responsibilities concerning uninsured patients and core public health functionswill simply be unsustainable. As all 50 states grapple with the financial and political realities of blockgrants, the complexities of state-level systems will be substantial. We can be hopeful that we will have50 successful case studies, for even a few failures could have significant adverse consequences for thelife and health of the citizens in those states. 211 Public Healthand Health Care ReformHealthy People in Healthy Communities This paper begins with a bias. The bias involves the imperative for an integrated system ofhealth care, defined federally through general national parameters, and administered in the community by means of a state-local partnership involving not only government but also the privatesector and providers. The system should focus On families, living in communities, with the overallgoal to assure \"healthy people living in healthy communities?' That is the bias and the approach topublic health and health care reform presented in this paper.This paper focuses on two major themes. First, the need to integrate public health into thenational agenda of health care reform is presented. Second, based on the stated bias and the assump-tion that it is the government's responsibility to develop and oversee a holistic system of care, the byMartin Wasserman, M.D., J.D. paper describes a vision-based philosophy developed by the National Association of County HealthOfti :ials (NACHO), with support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The mission of public health, as defined in the Institute of Medicine report The Future of Publicfica.th (1988), is \"to assure the conditions in which people can be healthy.\" The mission suggests thatthe American public should think about \"health\" care rather than \"illness\" cure. When considering the determinants of health, it is worth noting that lifestyle (individual behaviors)accounts for about 50 percent of what makes us healthier, what keeps us from being ill.Environmental conditions and heredity each account for only 20 percent. But, most important, med-ical care accounts for only 10 percent in terms of what keeps people healthy. And yet, looking at theamount of money put into the health care system, it is apparent that the United States puts most of itsmoney into tertiary care, with much lower priority and resourcesThe current paradigmis finally moving towardpartial integration asprevention and primarycare are brought into theprivate medical modelof the personal caresystem.given to community-based prevention, primary care, and publichealth services. At the same time, however, it can be argued that thecost-effectiveness is just the reverse: The most cost-effective part ofthe system is not the tertiary care system which serves a few, butthe primary care and public health systems, which serve the popu-lation and ensure adequate preventive services for all. ln terms of prevention, the fact that the country has to either paynow or pay later must be underscored. Investing in prevention now(though we might not receive an immediate return this quarter, thisyear, or possibly even this electoral cycle) will ultimately yieldgreater benefits in the long term. One way of helping legislators understand this notion and begin tothink about the long-term benefit is to ask them to make decisions as if they were grandparents con-sidering decisions that would affect their grandchildren. That places the consideration some 20 to 30years in the future and provides a long-term perspective beyond their elected term of office. 2142,. 0 A NEW PUBLIC HEALTH PARADIGM Having provided background, this paper will describe the current health system paradigm. A para-digm is a set of beliefs, a mind-set, or a way of thinking about things that governs attitudes, deci-sions, and methods of allocating resources and spending money. Our nation's current paradigmis a nonintersect of the personal, predominantly private, health care system, and of the public healthcare system which can be viewed as having three componentsprevention, primary care, andcommunity-based public health services.As our nation begins to look at the problems arising from this \"disconnect,\" three objectives forchange can be identified: universal access to care, cost reductions in our trillion dollar health budget,and maintenance of quality of care. A fourth component needs to be added. First, however, the cur-rent paradigm must shift from the disconnect nlodel and begin to integrate the personal and publichealth systems. The current paradigm is finally moving toward partial integration as prevention andprimary care are brought into the private medical model of the personal care system. The health sys-tem is beginning to support preventive services, encourage primary care gatekeepers, and highlightmanaged care health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Despite the fact that a new paradigm is evolving, issues remain. The currently evolving paradigm willnot guarantee a local government health presence to assure a holistic system of care with the abilityto regulate, facilitate, and evaluate health care services. There is no system to assess and respond toidentified problems, to assure community well-being, and to develop and maintain a data system tomonitor health and illness. Neither communicable disease surveillance nor environmental healthprotection is guaranteed. There is no system to focus on health education and support in the schoolsor workplaces where people spend most of their time. A fourth component, therefore, must be added to the three previously stated goals of universal access,cost containment, and maintenance of quality. That fourth component should be health statusimprovementnot only for the individual but also for the family and the community. Public health 215 argues that the missing objective in the current paradigm shift is the improvement of health status.In order to accomplish this, public and private health cafe must be fully integrated into a prevention-oriented managed primary care and community-based protective system. That should be the focusand quest for improving our health care system and achieving the goals collectively sought. BLUEPRINT FOR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS To begin to address implementation questions arising from such a new paradigm, the NationalAssociation of County Health Officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention currentlyare developing a blueprint for local public health departments. During this process, NACHO envi-sioned a system centered upon keeping people healthy and keeping communities healthy. Our organi-zation views this goal as fulfilling the covenant between government responsibilities and familiesliving in communities. This is public health's social contractto preserve and protect the health andwell-being of the American people and to improve the health status of people in the communitythrough disease prevention and health promotion. The blueprint articulates what local health agencies seek to do in public health. Public health controlsdisease outbreaks, reduces environmental hazards, and manages communicable diseases. Publichealth immunizes children and maintains clean air and water. Public health assures safe food, pro-vides health education and information, and provides support for vulnerable populations. What wedo in public health is both important and exciting. My home state of Maryland is creating a model of \"healthy people living in healthy communities.\"The Healthy Marylanders model will assure a safe and healthy environment to protect against suchenvironmental hazards as radon, asbestos, and lead in our drinking water, in paint, or in the dirt ofour urban communities. This model will help to maintain clean air and water, continue the safe foodhandling protection that currently exists, and work to prevent epidemics, control disease, and preventinjuries. 216 Maryland has just initiated a new project with the State Medical Society and the Maryland PhysiciansCampaign Against Family Violence. Through this project, physicians will receive training in recogniz-ing the elements of familY violence, including domestic violence, child abuse, andelder abuse. Healthcare workers will learn to recognize signs and symptoms, create safe environments for discussion,and become aware of existing community resources. This will be accomplished through a series oftrain-the-trainer programs, ultimately reaching workers in 80 hospitals throughout the state. ROLES. AND RESPONSIBILITIES The National Association of County Health Officials also believes that local health agencies have arole to play in maintaining the delivery and availability of services. Local health agencies mustassure that these health care servicesincluding preventive health care services; illness, injury, anddisability services; and mental health and substance abuse servicesare distributed responsibly andavailable for all people. Public health should assure that a safety net remains for those who are eitherat particularly high risk or who are part of the hard-to-reach populations such as the homeless ormigrant workers. For those populations, wraparound social support services must be provided toovercome existing problems such as language and cultural barriers. Public health must promote healthy behaviors among individuals,families, and communities. Community health education works topromote public understanding of what healthy lifestyles and behaviormodification mean so that persons can make their own choices withregard to their well-being.Public health servesthe good of the peopleand does not barterfor the bottom line. Furthermore, local public health agencies have the responsibility to maintain and assure quality.Unlike the other players, public health has no financial stake in the system, and can be objective instriving for real quality of patient care. Public health serves the good of the people and does not 217 barter for the bottom line. Therefore, government should monitor the health system for high quality.Accountability must remain a function of the public domain. Public health agencies, in order to make clear, rational, thoughtful, and competent decisions, mustproceed in a scientific manner with adequate data. Information is critical to provide adequate sur-veillance and an early warning system to interpret trends and make appropriate decisions based onscience. Public health diagnostic laboratory services are key to this process. Proactive management isneeded to establish health policy and resource allocation priorities based on scientific information. Asolid, well-integrated information system based on mortality and morbidity data and risk factors isneeded to guide decisions about health care priorities for the future. Public health at all levels also must invest in the technical competency of its workforce, both for todayand for tomorrow. A Council on Linkages has been established wherein the schools of public healthare working with state and local health officials as well as teachers of preventive medical care toencourage improved communications and integration between the delivery of health care services inthe community and the training of those who will be delivering care in a changing environment.Public health must seek new methods of continuing education to strengthen the current workforce tomeet the challenges of tomorrow. Public health practitioners also must become culturally competent. Part of assuring access to ser-vices is being certain that we understand the culture of the persons using the services in order to cre-aie a comfortable environment for them. Awareness and understanding of race, ethnic, gender, andgeographic differences must inform all that public health does. The public health community must support research, discovery, and innovation for the future.Innovation and research must be considered not only for our medical and biomedical care system,but also for our social and health care delivery system. Finally, public health must provide leadershipa shared vision of helping people to exist in healthycommunities. We must define our future by defining the problem and starting with a set of objectives. 218 In this case, the challenges are to achieve universal access, reduce costs, maintain quality, and improvethe public health status of individuals and communities. We must forego the old \"disconnect\" para-digm between the existing personal and public health care systems and create the new paradigm ofintegrating the two systems through prevention, primary care, and community-based services. The final message is a political onea call for adequate funding of the public health care syste Adedicated and consistent source of funding is needed. The current 0.9 percent of aggregated expendi-tures is inadequate. Some propose that 6 percent of the gross health care delivery budget be dedi-cated to public health, based on the notion that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.IUny believe, however, that 3 percent would be sufficient to achieve the goals for community-basedpublic health services. This would amount to about $25 billion to provide these public heahh servicesand make them fully operational nationwide. If our goal is to have healthy people living in healthy communities, then it follows that integrationand adoption of all of the identified elements must be achieved. 219r What's Needed to Move Forward?State MCH Program Perspectives /'ye been thinking about my role as synthesizer of all the conversations we have had over the lasttwo days, as I attempt to answer the question: \"What is needed to move forward?\" Indeed, thismay be the most challenging job of all!In considering capacity implications for MCH under a reformed system where it is antici-pated that most will have access to primary care, I found a useful way to frame both the questionsand the answers: Focus on Dr. Startle ld's taxonomy of the health services system within public health(see p. 17) and, from an MCH perspective, ask: \"What structures, what processes, what outcomes areneeded to accomplish the mission of promoting and protecting the health of the MCH populations inour communities?\" byMaxine Hayes, M.D., M.P.H. STRUCTURE Historically, health departments have been organized around categorical funding streams.Departments literally have been built around categorical functions, often with very narrow program-specific perspectives. Adequate capacity in many core functions has been hampered by constraintson categorical dollars. To play an effective role in a reformed system, the vision for maternal and childhealth, and for all of public health, demands strong leadership in the areas of systems development,quality assurance, service coordination, population-based assessment, and planning. I foresee a tremendous shift from concentration on direct service delivery to masterful ability to exe-cute core public health functions. The implications for MCH in the context of public health and reformare enormous. Beginning with a new way of organizing our human and fiscal resources, MCH willhave to retool staff for new roles, deploying those uncop:'ortable with change to the private sector. By way of example, the Washington State Department of Health took a bold step On December 1,1993, by reorganizing entirely around the core public health functions of assessment, policy develop-ment, and assurance) After virtually all of the state's 33 health departments and districts partici-pated in APEX Part 1, and a fair number in APEX Part II, it became clear that we lacked adequatecapacity in any of the core functions, but particularly in the area of assessment. Data informationsystems as well as epidemiological and statistical analysis and support were very limited. We realizedthat if health departments, both state and local, were going to have a future, we needed to get seriousabout core functions. The Department of Health currently has an epidemiology and health statistics division, a health sys-tems quality assurance division, an environmental health division, a public health laboratory divi-sion, and a community and family health division. Basically all of the personal service functions arenow in the community and family health division. We are attempting to break out of our categorical 2222 boxes by doing a lot more planning across program areas and defining problems more broadly. Inaddition, a central policy unit is part of the Office of the Secretary. Only time will tell whether thesemacro structural changes will improve our ability to be more responsive to public health problemsunder reform; at the moment, we feel that these were necessary changes. Within MCH, we are analyzing what clinical personal services we currently subsidize that might befinanced under our state's health reform law, in the Uniform Benefits Package, and we are surveyingthe skills base for a different type of technical assistance andconsultation. We envision training staff in areas of planning; I foresee a tremendous shiftneeds assessment; health information systems that track from concentration on directand monitor health status; standards; quality assurance; and service delivery to masterfulprogram evaluation, ability to execute core publichealth functions. With Washington State's passage of a comprehensive healthreform act in May I993,* we also recognized the need toforge relationships with new and evolving entities in the private sector, and to sustain relationshipswith public sector entities such as Medicaid, social services, and education. Skills in facilitation,effective communication, negotiation, and community mobilization, as well as an understanding ofmanaged care networks, are viewed as extremely valuable. Historically, the MCH program has had thecapacity to provide technical assistance and consultation in the clinical areas. In the future, we needto have adequate skills to assist local health jurisdictions in the nonclinical areas of planning, organi-zation, and administration during the transition from personal service to population-based activi-ties. Fortunately for maternal and child health (unlike some of the other categorical programs in Ahlumgh this kgislat ion was later repealed. many of the functions it outlined for the puNic health agency were retained and con-tinue to receive kgislative and public support. public health), the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89) charted a course towardsystems development capacity, so this trend is already in place or under way. PROCESS Increasingly, public health will need to have adequate processes in place for recognizing and definingexisting and emerging problems. This means adequate capacity for continuous and reliable monitor-ing of health-related risk factors (or protective factors) that affect entire communities. The MCH contribution to ongoing surveillance and tracking systems requires competent humanresourcesthat is, dedicated staff to design, manage, and maintain information systems that todayare simply nonexistent in many communities or at the state level. In Washington State, we are build-ing this critical capacity beginning at the ground floor. Some systems may need to be regionalized. Aswe sort through the provision of care based on need and the receipt of care based on individual andcommunity understanding of the value of prevention and wellness, we need to remember Dr. MikeMcGinnis' recent challenge2 to the public health community to begin looking at the real causes ofpremature death and disabilitytobacco, alcohol, injury, poor diet, lack of exercise, and unprotectedsexual activity. When we do this, we realize that if we are to influence health status, our \"process\"thinking must center on interventions that change behaviors. OUTCOME Ultimately, public health must answer the question: Has the reformed health system improved thehealth status of communities? To answer this question, a good as... sment of health status must bedocumented before, during, and after changes in the system. Evaluation measures over time andmonitoring of trends over time are areas where public health must build adequate capacity. 224 Additionally, policymakers will be interested in cost, so monitoring investments in prevention alsowill be very important. Typically, program evaluation and measurement of health services effective-ness have not been strong areas in health departments. One certain implication of reform is astrengthened public health role in this area. For MCH, this again means staff with ability to work veryclosely with applied epidemiology across programs and disciplines in order to develop means andmeasures to track health status. Information systems development has become extremely critical as we envision our future role.Fortunately, the health reform legislation in our state recognized how critical information systems willbe for Washington State and included statutory language mandating that the Department of Healthbecome the reservoir of all health services information; the legislation also authorized funding tobegin planning for a health services information highway. The Health Services Information System inWashington State is being designed as an integrated, statewide information system that will: Provide largely decentralized services, with some centralized information reposito-ries and with integrated data sets;Support key internal information needs and external reporting requirements of abroad variety of system uses;Use a standard, statewide data dictionary that has existing data standards built-inand that is compatible with national reform;Offer online availability and real time where feasible;Support continuous quality improvement for the health care system as a whole; andInclude incremental and cost-effective implementation. As mentioned earlier, public health is in need of a consistent, reliable funding stream that is notbogged down with categorical restrictions. Washington State is addressing this issue through thePublic Health ImprovementPlan3a document outlining what public health will need in the way ofresources, both human and fiscal, to reach adequate capacity at state and local levels in six areas: 225 administration, assessment, policy development, promotion, prevention, and protection. We haveattempted to delineate by personnel (full-time employees) and funding what we judge to be adequatecapacity in these areas. To date, we are still refining these estimates; however, a review of our work isat least a place to begin. The key to all of this is financial support through our state legislature to build and maintain capacityfor implementing core functions in all health jurisdictions. We cannot do it without money. For reformto work, public health has to be financed adequately. Fortunately, Washington States reform legislationhas built-in provisions for public health. (This has not been true in other states or in national reform.) In summary, I anticipate that state health agencies will likely become smaller over ensuing years.Structurally, these agencies will look different because their primary agendas will be to carry outmore and more population-based core function activities, with little involvement in the actual deliv-ery of clinical personal health services. Because presumably there will always be gaps in service forvulnerable populations, some personal health services currently delivered through public healthparticularly those involving significant threats to entire populations (e.g., sexually transmitted dis-eases, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS)probably will remain in public health indefinitely. For MCH specifically, I envision structural changes that support a smaller staff, with focus on func-tions in planning, assessment, program evaluation, quality assurance, and increased coordination atall levels with systems outside of health (such as education, welfare, mental health, drug and alcoholabuse, social services, and a variety of private and public community-based organizations). There areenormous opportunities for MCH in the midst of all this change. By way of example, the MCH-supported staff of one local health department in our state has already begun to make these changes. I am excited by the future, though surrounded by a host of new challenges. Each state will be tryingto figure out the structures, the processes, and the outcomes best suited for its population. I am hope-ful that what I have been able to share will have some utility as we all carve out the future of MCH,along with the future of all of public health under reform. 226rtF.

Commentary and Closure This workshop was planned and held in anticipation of health care reform, by which we meantthe passage of federal health care legislation that might fundamentally alter the health caredelivery system. As we all know, such legislation, including the President's proposed Health SecurityAct of 1994, was not enacted. We are witnessing, instead, what may be even more profound changes in the delivery of health care services. These changes are based fundamentally in the private sectorand represent the increasingly corporate nature of health care delivery, particularly through the expansion of managed health care plans.In a sense, then, we were at the right track but had bet on the wrong horse. The conceptsdeveloped at the workshop will be just as useful for assessing the impact and development of systems byBernard Guyer, M.D., M.RH 253 of privatized managed care for children as they would have been for guiding the development of afederally mandated system. The purpose of this commentary is to bring closure to the workshop proceedings, reflect on what wehave learned, and identify directions for the future. How can we use the ideas and experiencebrought to this forum to guide the work of federal, state, and local MCH agencies in the future? Whatare the major themes, and the next steps to be pursued? A \"SYSTEMS\" FRAMEWORK The antecedents of the workshop include the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA '89)amendments to Title V; these amendments charge the federal and state MCH agencies with responsi-bility for meeting the primary health care needs of children and youth and for building community-based systems of care. We anticipated using the workshop proceedings to guide the state and localMCH agencies in developing their role in relation to health care reform. The mandate and objectivesfor the workshop are in no way diminished, however, by the failure to enact federal health care reformlegislation. If anything, the tasks of designing the roles of public MCH agencies in an era of organized,privately owned managed health care systems become more challenging and important in the future. The framework for this commentary returns to an earlier discussion of the characteristics of a \"sys-tem.\" Here, we propose to examine each characteristic of a system of health care and identify theimportant implications for the work of maternal and child health. Ironically, the emerging managedcare industry is already oriented toward using the systems language and management approaches inthinking about its own development. The task becomes to orient the public agencies to thinking inthis manner. As noted in an earlier chapter (see page 9), systems are characterized by three major features: First,systems have a shared goal or purpose; second, systems are Made up of differentiated components 230r:-/ that complement each other; and, third, the components of a system communicate with each other toassure that the goal is met. What have we learned from the woikshop proceedings in relation to eachof these features? How can we use this framework to help us guide future work? SHARED GOALS If a system is to have a common goal, then the goal must be articulated and shared by the private andpublic sectors. The Title V legislation sets broad goals for child health in this country, and HealthyPeople 2000 articulates these goals in specific, measurable objectives for health status and health careutilization. These national goal statements are clearly population oriented and encompass all chil-dren and their families. In the developing managed care systems, however, goals are set for defined groups of enrolled sub-scribers, not for entire populations within geographic jurisdictions. Managed care organizations arenot likely to accept responsibility for nonenrollees. Thus, a major function of the MCH agencies willbe to maintain the population focus. The MCH agencies must set goals for the entire population andremain particularly cognizant of those subpopulations that are likely to fall through the cracks in thesystem. These populations are likely to include the disadvantaged low-income working familieswithout health insurance, minorities, legal immigrants and undocumented workers, and rural andmigrant children, among others. In addition, managed care organizations are likely to crisscross geo-graphic jurisdictions in complex and overlapping ways. Thus, MCH agencies will need to work withmultiple managed care organizations to assure awareness of population-based health goals and coor-dination of efforts to address these goals. Finally, subscribers will have opportunities to change man-aged care plans, creating the potential for gaps in coverage. Health care services will need to beassured during these temporal gaps. Overall, a crucial function of the MCH agency will be to assesscommunity needs and assure that the multiple and overlapping managed care organizations main-tain adequate coverage so that each child has access to a system of care. 231 Another major goal of maternal and child health in the emerging managed care environment is toassure the development, acceptance, and implementation of a child-specific standard of need.Without such an explicit standard, it is unlikely that managed care organizations will guaranteehealth care services that meet the unique needs of their child subscribers. The key elements of astandard of need for children have been articulated by Jameson and Wehr. The rationale for such aspecific standard includes the fact that children are dependent and need their families and commu-nity institutions to look out for their well-being. Children are in a state of continual and often rapiddevelopment so that the services provided to them must include not only maintenance of health butpromotion of optimal development. Finally, children have different epidemiological conditions thanadults. Health care systems must provide for these particular epidemiological patterns. MCH agen-cie must work to establish such children's standards of need and then assure that the standards aremet by all providers. COMPONENTS OF A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM Starfield has articulated the components of a primary care system for children. The attributes of pri-mary care provide the framework for these components. First-contact care is intended to be a gate-keeping function that not only keeps children out of the emergency.room for nonurgent care, but alsoassures that a primary care site is aware of and directing all of the health care decisions concerningthese children. Longitudinality requires a single provider to serve as the medical home and maintainongoing contact with the family. Coordination implies a responsibility for managing elements of careprovided in a variety of settings and assuring the appropriate level of communication between thesettings. Comprehensiveness requires that health care systems be able to provide the range of servicesappropriate to the broad health care needs of a childhood population. This is an area of particularconcern because of the cost implications of maintaining relationships with pediatric specialists toserve low-incidence conditions. Cultural competence is not an optional feature of the health care sys-tem, but, rather, a fundamental component assuring that health care providers are aware of the cul-turally determined health care beliefs and practices that will result in effective use and treatment. 232 Family-based care assures that families participate in the care and decision making about their chil-dren. Finally, community-oriented care is needed to relate childrer's health care needs to the varietyof environmental influences and community resources with implications for child and family. These components of an effective primary care system must be present if the system is to yield thekinds of positive outcomes that have been documented in many European countries. It is clear fromthe workshop presentations that such primary care systems can be delivered from a variety of insti-tutional bases and through a variety of creative arrangements between public and private sectors.Clearly, however, children's health specialists at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels must beinvolved in the development of such systems. The standard-setting regulatory and contractualauthorities of public MCH agencies at the state and local levels are the tools of government that canbe used to build such a system.Public MCH agencies themselves must become an integral component of the community-basedhealth care system. When universal health care coverage is achieved, these agencies will no longerprovide direct health care services (as they once did) to women and children, including children withspecial needs. However, as providers of some direct services in special settings (such as schools), aspurchasers of services, and, finally, as official agencies with assessment, assurance, and policy func-tions, the MCH agencies must become part of the emerging network of health care. COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE COMPONENTS Fundamental to systems theory is the notion that the components of a system communicate amongeach other to meet the common objective. At the basis of such communications are timely data sys-tems that measure key variables, make a patient-specific database (information system) available topractitioners, and monitor indicators of utilization and health status. Managed health care organiza-tions already monitor patient data for fiscal purposes and usually maintain a computerized medicalrecord. Such efforts must be expanded to include the data elements necessary to assure that the sys-tem is working for the benefit of children. 23357 Walker and others have described the ways in which data systems can be used to assure maternal andchild health services. Above all, MCH agencies must hold the health care system accountable for theways in which it serves the best interests of children. Good data systems are at the heart of theaccountability functions of government. Good data also must be made available to the public and topolicymakers at the community level to allow them to monitor system performance. FUTURE DIRECTIONS Few of us would have accurately predicted the outcome of the great health care debate of 1993-94,making the identification of future directions somewhat problematic. It seems evident, however, thatfuture development of the health care system will be driven by the major societal forcesincludingshifting demographics that will emphasize the care of adults and the elderly, further efforts to curbthe growth of health care costs and their burden on business and industry, and less dependence onthe regulatory mechanisms of government coupled with more dependence on the marketplacetoguide services development. In this environment, it is the responsibility of advocates for children tomake the case for the benefits of organized systems of primary care as the foundation for the ade-quate development and health of our children. Some observers have made the case for an investmentstrategynamely, that we must invest in the health and development of our children if the nation isto have a strong and secure future. The academic, advocacy, and provider communities must join forces to become effective spokesper-sons for the health and developmental needs of children. The arguments for strong primary care sys-tems and for effective governmental MCH agencies must be based on the kinds of arguments andexperiences expressed during this workshop. Future work must include efforts to experiment withnew forms of health services delivery, evaluations of the multitude of natural experiments currentlyunder way across the nation, and further research into the systems characteristics that best serve theneeds of children and families.
