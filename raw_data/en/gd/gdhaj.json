Naturopathy, or natural medicine, is a form of alternative medicine with a deep history of traditional philosophies and practices and natural treatment options for patients. It aims at stimulating the body's self-healing capacity and promotes a concept of going back to an innate balance. It involves the treatment and prevention of health disorders through the use of natural therapies, methods and materials. Natural medicine should be considered complementary medicine rather than an alternative to standard medical care. You should inform your doctor if you are also using alternative therapies. What types of treatment do naturopathic doctors offer? There are six core principles that a naturopath follows for the treatment of patients, which include: - Identify and treat the cause - Use the healing power of nature - Do no harm - Treat the entire patient - Prevention of disease and health promotion - Be a teacher first Naturopaths may perform physical examinations, laboratory tests, [gynaecological examinations](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/gynaecological-examination), nutritional and dietary assessments, [allergy tests](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/allergy-testing), and other diagnostic tests. Through these tests and examinations, they combine and adapt treatments to the needs of the patient. The treatments that naturopathy uses to improve the body are determined by the patient's needs and include the following: - A natural diet: Naturopaths usually recommend what, how, and when to eat rather than a diet per se. - Herbal medicine: This practice is based on using natural remedies and herbs according to the patient's needs in order to preserve their wellbeing. - Oligotherapy: Trace minerals are used to keep the body functions balanced and going. - Reflexology: Some specific areas of the foot are stimulated to get a beneficial effect on other organs and tissues of the body. [Acupuncture](https://www.topdoctors.co.uk/medical-dictionary/acupuncture-treatment): Thin needles are placed in targeted parts of the body to simulate the areas and affect their function. - Kinesiology: The study of the dynamics of human movement and its anatomical, biochemical, neuromotor, psychological and physiological aspects. - Hydrotherapy: Water is used as a form of therapy, rehabilitation, exercise and relaxation technique to relieve symptoms.
