During an e-stim treatment, the practitioner will insert acupuncture needles around the site of dysfunction, and then hook up small electrical leads to the needles. They will turn on the e-stim machine and increase the amplitude until the patient barely feels a sensation. Then the practitioner will slowly increase the amplitude until the sensation feels strong, but comfortable. After about 10 minutes, the sensation the patient feels is often reduced, and the practitioner may increase the amplitude again to achieve a greater therapeutic effect. Our E-stim machine has 3 sets of independent leads, with the ability to target multiple areas in one treatment. "}
