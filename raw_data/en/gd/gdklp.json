Simply rinse your gel for 15 minutes inwater, stain with 20 ml of SimplyBlue SafeStain, and analyze your results. A fixative solution is not required forany gel format. Bands begin to develop immediately. In as little as 5 minutes, you can see 1 \u00b5g of protein. For fast results, gels can be analyzed directly in the stain, eliminatinghours of destaining time. If you need maximum sensitivity and crystal clear background, you can perform an optionalwater-based destain. With SimplyBlue your bands will never fade-even if the gel is left overnight in the stain ordestain. You don't have to watch over your gels, freeingyour time for more important matters.SimplyBlueSafeStain is a uniquely formulated, ready-to-use Coomassie\u00ae G-250 stain used to visualize protein bands in polyacrylamide gels. With SimplyBlue, you'll get the highly sensitive staining results your experiments require-fast. Solution pr eparation time and expenditure is eliminated, saving you time and money. In addition, staining with SimplyBlueis completely non-hazardous and the protocol does not require acid/alcohol fixatives ordestaining solutions. You'll save money on hazardous material shipping, waste storage, anddisposal charges, and you'll create a healthier work environment. No other commerciallyavailable protein stain can meet these standards. Simple protocol is fast and flexible Figure 1 - Staining with SimplyBlueSafeStain is as easy as 1 -2-3 Rinse your gel with water for 5 minutes. Repeat two more times. Stain your gel with 20 ml of SimplyBlue SafeStain for 1 hour*. Bands develop in minutes.Analyze your gel directly in the stain, orcontinue with the optional water-baseddestaining protocol to achieve maximumsensitivity and crystal-clear background. *Although 1 \u00b5g of most proteins can be detected within 5 minutes, the SimplyBlue Basic Protocol recommends staining for 1 hour to ensure ma ximum dye saturation of all proteins and concentrations.1 2 3 Toll Free: 800 955 6288SimplyBlueSafeStain Versatile Staining Reagent The patented NuPAGE\u00aeGel system offers high-performance protein separation in a neutral pH environment. This results inreduced protein modifications and increased gel stability to ensureaccurate separation results and provide a 12-month shelf-life.SimplyBlue SafeStain is specifically designed to achieve maximum staining performance with NuPAGE\u00aeGels. NuPAGE\u00aeGels stained with SimplyBluedemonstrate faster band development and more sensitive staining results than with other commercially availableCoomassie stains (Figure 2). With SimplyBlue, less than 7 ng of reduced BSA can be detected-that's at least two times greatersensitivity than with other stains. If you're not using NuPAGE \u00ae Gels don't worry. SimplyBluewill give you fast, polyacrylamide gels including Tris-Glycine, Tricine, Bis-Tris 4-12% Gel stained with SimplyBlue for 1 hour, then destained overnight in a water-based destain.

The gels inFigure 3 demonstrate staining resultsachieved with SimplyBlue over other Coomassie stains.After just 5 minutes in the SimplyBlueSafeStain, 1 mg of protein can be detected. With additional water-baseddestaining, 7 ng or less can be detected. In addition,there is no loss in sensitivity when the gel is leftovernight in the destain.
