This toolkit was originally developed thr ough collaborative work undertaken in 2014 between New Devon CCG, NHS Kernow and the NHS England Devon, Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Area Team. Its core objective is to assist practitioners in taking a common approach to case finding, assessment, car e planning and case management of older people living with frailty. Since then, there have been significant developments including publication of key clinical and practical guidance, notably Fit for Frailty , Validation of the electronic Frailty Index and NICE guidance NG56 on multimorbidity . The toolkit has been updated to reflect these developments and the inclusion of routine frailty identification in the General Practice contract for 2017/18. Frailty can be considered as a long -term health condition characterised by loss of physical, emotional and cognitive resilience as a result of the accumulation of multiple health def icits. Frailty is progressive, typically erodes functional, cognitive and/or emotional reserves and increases vulnerability to sudden loss of independence and adverse health outcomes following a comparatively minor stressor event such as an acute infection or injury. While severe frailty can be comparatively easy to recognise and diagnose, lesser degrees of frailty may be more difficult to differentiate from normal ageing. People living with severe frailty comprise around 3% of the population aged 65 and older in England. For moderate frailty it is 12% of those aged 65 and older and 35% for mild frailty (ref: Validation of t he electronic Fr ailty Index ). These individuals are frequent users of services across health and social care and are particularly vulnerable to adverse outcomes, in particular health outcomes such as unplanned admissions to hospital , care home admission , acquisition of ne w disability or death. However there is evidence that for some of this group, these adverse outcomes could be avoided through proactive case finding, timely comprehensive assessment, care planning and targeted proactive use of services outside of hospital (Mytton et al, 2012). Like other long -term condition s, frailty can be effectively managed within primary care. It takes five to ten years to develop and there is often a trajectory of slow functional deterioration. Currently older people with mild, modera te or severe frailty often present in crisis and, as clinicians, we may manage the acute crisis but not recognise and address the underlying vulnerabilities. However we know that with early identification of frailty and clear consideration of ways to optim ise care and support for adults with multimorbidity, there are interventions that can be used to manage its progression effectively at key stages. These focus on reducing the likelihood of, or planning for the impact of, crisis and promote earlier and opti mal recovery. T Toolkit for general practice in supporting older people liv ing with frailty TWO: CASE FINDING outine frailty identification using hea lth record dat a, and direct patient assessment, more accurately targets older people at greater risk of adverse outcomes than previous risk stratification techniques. The identification of frailty can be both opportunistic, by assessing for frailty in people who present to health and care services, or population based , where a more systematic approach is taken to proactively identifying people who might be living with the condition. Traditional risk stratification may be relati vely insensitive and has the potential to miss 25% of older patients living with frailty because it relies on numbers of completed admissions and so may not identify patients with underlying risk of adverse health outcomes prior to admission. Effective case finding of older people living with frailty should be done as part of a multi -disciplinary approach in primary care with the three aims of: Identifying individuals aged over 65 years who are living with frailty, and the degree of their cond ition (mild, moderate, severe) . Identifying an individual from within the primary care team who will coordinate frailty care for those people who are living with the condition . Identifying the principle needs of the person living with frailty and selecting the most appropriate care to meet those needs. This is likely to require holistic and comprehensive assessment of need, care and support planning to promote self -management where feasible, community care and support to address issues such as social isolat ion and loneliness, and social care and support to meet care needs. R Toolkit for general practice in supporting older people living with frailty 5 Approach to Frailty Case Finding in General Practice in England: The 2017/18 General Practice Contract sets out the requirements in England for frailty as follows: Practices will use an appropriate tool e.g. electronic Frailty Index (eFI) to identify patients from their practice population aged 65 and over who are living with moderate and severe frailty. For those patients identified as living with severe frailty, t he practice will deliver a clinical review providing an annual medication review and where clinically appropriate discuss whether the patient has fallen in the last 12 months and provide any other clinically relevant interventions. In addition, where a pa tient does not already have a Summary Care Record (SCR) the practice will promote this , seeking informed patient consent to activate the SCR. Data and monitoring Practices will code clinical interventions for this group appropriately. Data will be collected on: o the number of patients recorded with a diagnosis of moderate frailty o the number of patients with severe frailty o the number of patients with severe frailty with an annual medication review o the number of patients with severe frailty who are rec orded as having had a fall in the preceding 12 months, and o the number of severely frail patients who provided explicit consent to activate their enriched SCR. NHS England will use this information to understand the nature of the interventions made and the prevalence of frailty by degree among practice populations and nationally. This data will not be used for performance management purposes. Toolkit for general practice in supporting older people liv ing with frailty Suggested methods for case finding 1 electronic Frailty Index The electronic Frailty Index (eFI) was developed in collaboration between the University of Leeds, TPP, the University of Bradford, the University of Birmingham and Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Yorkshir e & Humber AHSN's Improvement Academy has supported the roll out of the eFI through its Healthy Ageing Collaborative. The eFI uses routinely collected primary care data, coded within general practice electronic patient records, to calculate a frailty index and to identify older people with mild, moderate and severe frailty. A higher eFI score suggest a higher degree of frailty , which is associated with increased risk of care home admission, hospitalisation, and mortality. The tool identifies patients who w ould benefit from further assessment. The eFI is now embedded within the main primary care systems . Practices who have access to the eFI in the electronic patient records system should use this to stratify their population aged 65 and over by degree of frailty into those who are fit (not frail) and those who are living with mild, moderate or severe frailty. For those patients in the moder ate and severe groups, a clinician from the primary care team should verify the frailty diagnosis by direct assessment using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) [appendix one] or similar validated tool. For patients who are living with mild frailty this equa tes to a CFS score of 4 to 5. For patients who are living with moderate frailty this equates to a CFS score of 6. For patients who are living with severe frailty this equates to a CFS score of 7 or above . Patients living with moderate and severe frailty sh ould have their frailty diagnosis coded in their electronic health record system. Individual practices may choose to do this verification systematically or opportunistically, for example by using the CFS at every consultation for patients aged 65 years and over for whom the eFI has identified moderate or severe frailty. In addition , frailty verification could be undertaken within appropriate clinics, e.g. flu/shingles vaccine clinics, chronic disease clinics. CFS can also be completed by -community nurses/c ommunity matrons, or appropriate allied health professionals and fed back to the practice. Toolkit for general practice in supporting older people living with frailty 7 2 Practices without access to the eFI For the small number of practices who do not have access to this tool it is suggested that the primary care recor d be used to identify patients aged over 65 years in the following groups who may be considered for the gait speed test or PRISMA7 score for initial identification , followed by the completion of the CFS for diagnostic decision , if necessary : a. People who are resident in care homes. b. People known to be living with dementia. c. People aged over 65 who have experienced one of the major frailty syndromes, which are: Falls (e.g. collapse, legs gave way, 'found lying on floor'). Immobility (e.g. sudden change 'gone off legs', 'stuck in toilet'). Delirium (e.g. acute confusion, sudden worsening of confusion in someone with previous dementia or known memory loss). Incontinence (e.g. change in continence - new onset or worsening of urine or faecal incontine nce). Susceptibility to side effects of medication. d. Those aged 65 or above with multimorbidity due to 4 or more long term conditions. e. Those on over 10 medications. f. Those with complex neurological conditions, e.g. stroke, MS, Parkinson's disease. g. Those hou sebound or known to community nurses - this data could be obtained from those community nurses who visit for flu vaccines, if not read coded. h. Those on community matron, district nursing caseload, end of life ( EOL) register or cancer care lists. i. Those known to adult social care and support services with continuous support needs . j. All people aged over 85 . Toolkit for general practice in supporting older people liv ing with frailty 3 Read coding for frailty There are read codes available to enable frailty to be recorded as a diagnosis and for frailty registers to be populated. They are: CTV3 X76Ao frailty SNOMED concepts for to | Frailty (finding): 925791000000100 | Mild frailty (finding) 925861000000102 | Severe frailty (finding) Toolkit for general practice in supporting older people living with frailty 10 THREE: ASSESSMENT he gold standard approach for people living with moderate or severe frailty is comprehensive geriatric assessment , as detailed in resources available from the BGS website The 2017/18 General Practice Contract focusses on 2 key evidence -based interventions : a falls risk assessment ; and annual medication review. These form the key components of the comprehensive geriatric assessment and are supported by a good evidence base. Falls risk identification a nd next steps This should follow the guidance set out in NICE CG 161: (Falls in older people, assessing risk and prevention) https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg161 The falls and fracture consensus st atement sets out the key elements of effective falls service for commissioners and strategic leads: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/falls -and-fractures -consensus -statement . Annual medication review and next steps The STOPP START criteria may be used when reviewing medications for an older person with severe frailty Stopp Start Toolkit Supporting Medication Review, NHS Cumbria editi on For patients with frailty and multimorbidity (2 or more long term conditions) NICE NG56 provides guidance on tailoring care for people with multimorbidity : https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng56 Practices and their local primary care services may wish to go further in assessing patients with moderate and severe frailty based on individual patient need and professional judgement as set out below . Further assessment a. Completion of brief CGA (Appendix four) and generation of a problem list. b. Holistic medical review aimed at optimising management of long -term conditions and referral to other disciplines if needed. Underlying diagnoses and reversible contributors to frailty should be addressed. c. A full medi cation review using STOPP START methodology (Appendix five). T Toolkit for general practice in supporting older people living with frailty 11 d. Individualised goal setting in collaboration with the patient and carers if appropriate. e. Generation of a personalised care plan. The NHS England and Coalition for Collaborative Care handbook on personalised care and support planning provides further details . Completion of the brief CGA enables you to create a problem list and this will inform your care - planning activity. Appendix four is an example of a brief CGA tool which has been produced by a steering group of clinicians across Devon and Cornwall. It takes approximately 8 -10 minutes to complete. It is suggested that after the brief CGA is completed, there is discussion at the multi -disciplinary team meeting and core group members should then decide which patients require a more in -depth CGA and who will be involved in carrying it out. In -depth CGA involves a holistic, multi -dimensio nal, interdisciplinary assessment of an individual by a number of specialists of many disciplines in older people's health, often including a geriatrician (BGS, 2014). .

The test can be performed with any patient able to walk 4 metres using the guidelines below. 1. Accompany the patient to the designated area, which should be well -lit, unobstructed and contain clearly indicated markings at 0 and 4 metres. 2. Position the patient with his/her feet behind and just touching the 0 -metre start line. 3. Instruct the patient to \"Walk at your comfortable pace\" until a few steps past the 4 -metre mark (the patient should not start to slow down before the 4 -metre mark). 4. Begin each trial on the word \"Go\". 5. Start the timer with the first footfall after the 0 -metre line. 6. Stop the timer with the first footfall after the 4 -metre line. 7. Repeat three times, allo wing sufficient time for recuperation between trials. Appendix three: PRISMA7 questions A score of three or more indicates frailty. 1. Are you more than 85 years? 2. Male? 3. In general do you have any health problems that require you to limit your activities? 4. Do you need someone to help you on a regular basis? 5. In general do you have any health problems that require you to stay at home? 6. In case of need can you count on someone close to you? 7. Do you regularly use a stick, walker or wheelchair to get about?
