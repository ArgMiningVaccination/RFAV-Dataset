[Get details](#affiliate). Aromatherapy: A Holistic Guide to Natural Healing With Essential Oils was originally published in 1996 as Aromatherapy: A Lifetime Guide to Healing With Essential Oils. Valerie Cooksley states that this new publication contains the same general information as the original publication, but that the statistics and research have been updated. Below is my description of the original 1996 publication: Aromatherapy: A Lifetime Guide to Healing With Essential Oils provides many recipes for medical conditions and supplies brief monographs (descriptions) for 30 oils. The book is broken down into organized topics (i.e. hair and skin, circulatory system, digestive system, emotions, children's issues, etc.). and then breaks down further into specific conditions. From there, this text supplies a lot of information on the condition and aromatherapy recipes that can be used to help the condition. Although I haven't counted the number of recipes it contains, this volume is thick and supplies a large collection of recipes. Amazon.com typically offers this book for the lowest price around.
