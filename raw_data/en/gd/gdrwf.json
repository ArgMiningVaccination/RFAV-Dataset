Join us as we delve into the remarkable life of 95-year-old Dr. Edith Eva Eger, a survivor of Auschwitz, distinguished clinical psychologist, and bestselling author. Edith's life's journey is a testament to the incredible power of resilience, healing, and the unwavering human spirit. At just 16 years old, she and her family were transported to the infamous Auschwitz concentration camp where she would barely survive the horrors of the Holocaust. After being liberated and immigrating to the United States, she embarked on her own healing journey which led to a career in psychology and a deep desire to help others break free from victimhood and become a survivor. Accompanied by her grandson Jordan, who helps her navigate the tech and sometimes awkward world of ZOOM, Edie shares her insights on how we can all harness the power within us to overcome trauma and transform our lives. In this episode, we touch on Dr. Eger's most recent book, The Gift: 12 Lessons to Save Your Life. These 12 lessons shed enormous light on the transformative power of choice. She reminds us that even in the face of unimaginable trauma, the power to choose how we respond remains within our grasp, igniting the path towards healing and living a fulfilling life. Dr. Eger leaves us with a message of hope, encouraging us to embrace our wounds as gifts that unlock our very potential, so we can lead a life of courage, empowerment, and purpose. I truly believe if Edie can survive the unfathomable evil of Auschwitz, and then go onto thrive in all areas of life, we can overcome ANYTHING.

In this episode, I talk about two important events that occurred in my life during the last 9 months. First, I discuss my explant surgery! I dive into my entire journey from what drove me to get implants in the first place and why I decided to get them removed last October. I cover how the surgery went, some secrets I utilized to heal faster, and how I feel now as a result. Breast Implant Illness is a real issue affecting millions of women, so whether you have implants, are considering implants, know women with implants AND a mystery or chronic illness, or are just curious to hear my story, this is a good episode to catch. Second, I cover my profound experience at the recent Advance Weeklong Meditation Retreat with Dr. Joe Dispenza. In the 7 years since I met and worked with Joe, he's been trying to get me to come to a weeklong. Well, I am beyond grateful I finally did because it was nothing short of LIFE-CHANGING. I share my firsthand experience of the retreat, some of the deep transformation that occurred, and some of the side effects of committing to this intense and beautiful program. Including, but not limited to, a total upgrade of your nervous system and biology, deep healing, release of trauma and stuck emotions, miracles, synchronicities, mystical moments, happy tears, connection with SOURCE, and a connection to a beautiful community whose hearts and minds are changing the world through coherence. If you have ever been curious about attending one of Dr. Joe's retreats this episode is a must listen. And lastly, after many of you reached out on Instagram about my favorite manifestation tools, I share one powerful example of how gratitude journaling helped manifest my current relationship (my husband). If you want to learn how to feel into the future you desire and draw it to you like a magnet, this episode is for you!

In 2009, she studied at the American College of Traditional Chinese Medicine and then went on to graduate from the AADP certified Natural Healing Institute of Naturopathy where she studied the medical sciences, holistic nutrition, and clinical herbalism. She is currently studying at the School of Evolutionary Herbalism where she is learning to implement vitalist herbalism, herbal alchemy and medical astrology. She bridges the best of scientific lab diagnostics to the metaphysical realm of spirit and has created a truly holistic approach to establishing the balance and alignment of mind, body, and soul. In this episode of The HEAL Podcast, Caitlin and I embark on a profound journey of self-discovery and empowerment. We delve into the world of parasite cleansing, uncovering the potential physical, emotional and spiritual benefits it can bring to our overall health. Caitlin guides us through the intricate relationship between our bodies and parasites, shedding light on the importance of addressing these often-overlooked stealthy buggers. We discuss the frequency of parasites and how removing them from our body can have fascinating ripple effects in our outer world, as well as uncover suppressed emotions and trauma! I myself did her parasite cleansing protocol a few months ago and the positive effects (and what I released!) BLEW MY MIND. I feel like everyone needs to do a parasite cleanse once a year as a vital reset or to kickoff or deepen your healing journey (if your doctor approves, of course). Oh, and you need to start Caitlin's recommended 3 week cleanse on a full moon so if this intrigues you at all, be sure to listen to/watch the episode now so you have time to order the herbs! Embarking on a parasite cleanse can be a proactive step towards optimizing your health and well-being. While there are various approaches to parasite cleansing, starting the process before a full moon is believed by some to enhance its effectiveness.To learn more about Caitlin and to experience a parasite cleanse for yourself visit www.VertiasBotanica.com and use the coupon code HEAL to save $15 OFF on your kit!
