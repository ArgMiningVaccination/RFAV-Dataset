Transcript Can you elaborate on the rationale behind the newly-recommended systematic screening for patients with diabetes and comorbid CVD? Patients with diabetes exhibit an increased risk to develop cardiovascular disease, and there's a high incidence of undetected diabetes in patients that we see in our cardiology departments. And since we now have treatment options for patients with diabetes\u2014type 2 diabetes in particular\u2014to reduce cardiovascular risk, it's very important to screen our patients to identify them as early as possible to allow and to make it possible to introduce these cardiovascular risk-reducing therapies. Why is it important to annually screen for chronic kidney disease among patients with type 2 diabetes? In addition to cardiovascular disease, patients with diabetes often develop chronic kidney disease [CKD], and the presence of chronic kidney disease has an impact on the prognosis and CKD is a driver for the development of cardiovascular disease by itself. Therefore, it is important to evaluate patients not only for cardiovascular disease, but for the presence of target organ damage, in particular chronic kidney disease. And therefore, we recommend that they are regularly screened for the presence of CKD using eGFR [estimate glomerular filtration rate] and urine albumin creatinine ratio in the spot urine, so an easy tool to measure it. Because if we have a patient with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease, we have new treatment options, for example, SGLT2 [sodium glucose co-transporter 2] inhibitor finerenone\u2014agents that have been shown in cardiovascular outcome trials to reduce cardiovascular but also kidney failure risk. What key components are considered in the SCORE2-Diabetes scoring system? It is important in patients without ASCVD [atherosclerotic CVD] and severe target organ damage to quantify their risk and do a risk stratification. There were different scores, but they had difficulties not covering various aspects. So we introduced a new score\u2014SCORE2-Diabetes\u2014which had the original components of the very-well-established SCORE2, which had age, smoking, and many other components [like] blood pressure, lipids, and in addition, diabetes-specific components [such as] duration of diabetes, HbA1C [hemoglobin A1C], and eGFR. And this score is a specific score for patients with type 2 diabetes to predict the 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event, fatal or nonfatal MI [myocardial infarction], or stroke. "}
