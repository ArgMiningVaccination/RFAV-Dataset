Having experienced energy healing and other dimensions since an early age, she is uniquely equipped to present an integrated path that includes both approaches. Martin might order conventional Western medical tests for a patient and then might equally investigate a patient's soul contracts and energy patterns. She calls this 'Maximum Medicine.' The shamanic perspective is that the soul contracts with which you came into this life aren't static. The book includes many invitations to self-inquiry and shamanic exercises, one of which encourages you to change the rules of the game. A superb contribution to the new paradigm in healing, Maximize Your Healing Power is highly recommended for anyone seeking to understand every dimension of their health and maximize their vitality.\" - Dawson Church, Ph.D., researcher, founder of the National Institute for Integrative Healthcare (NIIH \"Dr. Martin, through personal stories, shows that Western medicine can blend with shamanic practices to give a more holistic approach to healing. She outlines a clear step-by-step process, through guided meditation, to take control of the healing journey.
