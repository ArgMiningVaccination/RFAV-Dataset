It aims to release the chronic patterns of tension in the body using advanced massage techniques, slow strokes and deep finger pressure on the contracted areas. DTM can help to break up and eliminate toxins from muscles it can improve circulation and muscle tone and also promotes a sense of well being. Why get a DTM? As well as feeling good, it can be beneficial to your health. When muscles are stressed, they can block oxygen and nutrients. This can lead to inflammation,which in turn builds up toxins in the muscle tissue. DTM can help to loosen muscle tissue, releasing toxins from muscles, ensuring that blood and oxygen circulate efficiently throughout your body. DTM usually focuses on more specific areas and may cause some soreness during or immediately after the massage. However, you should feel better than ever within one or two days. DTM can also help you to sleep better, and is great for pain relief. Maintenance specific areas such as back or legs Maintenance - full back or specific areas Maintenance full body Deep muscle work and corrective massage; ideal for releasing tension; improving flexibility; speeding up healing of damaged or stressed muscles, tissues, joints preventing future injuries It is only natural to get up in the morning and yawn and stretch, stretching is also a great antidote to sedentary jobs as well as the obvious pre and post training/work out session. A good stretch session can work out kinks and restore range of motion and can be especially helpful for those who are involved in regular vigorous exercise, such as sports, dance and gym goers. It is the process of gradually applying gentle force to lengthen and lubricate muscles and joints. It is a way to show you love your body because it requires complete focus on yourself. Stretching has both neurological and mechanical effects on muscles and connective tissue. A stretch needs to be held long enough for muscles to relax so that they can be passively lengthened. As you hold a stretch, consciously relax the tight muscle and feel the myofascial tissues around it elongate. Once the muscle fully relaxes, the connective tissues can begin to stretch. This treatment involves passive stretching. Passive is when someone else moves your muscle and when matched with massage can improve the benefits of stretching threefold: A massage therapist is able to focus on isolated muscles or the whole body. A massage brings the body back into balance so that muscles are properly aligned. A massage can realign scar tissue with gentle force over a period of time as suppleness is restored to the skin. A massage therapist will make sure you don't overdo muscle stretching if you are recovering from an illness, an athlete between workouts or not in good condition. The benefits of combining stretching and massage include improving blood pressure and heart rate. You may believe that only people who excessively exercise have good body tone, but that is not true. Stretching can slowly lead to aerobic exercise but along the way your body will experience greater muscle tone. A massage may be passive stretching but it can offer active vitality in your life.

My Grandfather, a small holding farmer used to get me to heat up camphorated oil (Camphor oil), mixed with coconut oil to rub into his aching back and shoulder after a hard days work in the fields. The main factor of that was the heating of the oil over kerosene lamps and I didn't realise how much I was being taught at the time. Came to England as a young boy and after many years became a therapist and on my visit back to St.Thomas I visited Bath Fountain,which are naturally heated springs. I was persuaded to have a massage from a local therapist who dipped my towel in the water then placed it on my back and proceeded to massage my back using the heat. This reminded me of my grandfather and his heated oils. On my return back to England I tried and failed in many attempts to reconstruct those techniques. After years of practising heat massage, I feel I have now perfected the capturing of these feelings by my new treatment called 'Caribbean Heat Massage' This treatment is for pampering,relaxation or it can be combined with deep tissue to soothe aches and pains,relaxing muscles but rejuvenating you at the same time. Sounds of the Caribbean, luxurious warm massage using special oils to relieve aches & pains.

Indian head massage uses and adapts classic Swedish massage techniques, for treating the scalp, face, neck, shoulders and upper arms. It is extremely effective for treating stress because it works on the areas of the body most affected i.e.the shoulders, upper back, neck and head.

However, although the treatment focuses on the upper torso and head, the effects are felt throughout the entire body.
