Q: Is it still necessary to wear masks after vaccination? A: Since no vaccine can provide 100 percent protection, a few people could still be infected. The population immune barrier has not been established at present. Therefore, prevention cannot rely entirely on vaccination. People should wear masks, maintain social distancing and practice good hygiene. 22. Q: Can individuals bring vaccines overseas? A: There are strict approval procedures for the entry and exit of vaccines. Individuals are not allowed to carry vaccines out of the country without permission, otherwise they may risk violating domestic and foreign laws. 23. Q: When can the general public begin vaccination? A: After vaccines are approved by authorities to enter the market, the public could receive vaccination according to policies and the supply. 24. Q: Is it necessary for people who had COVID-19 or were asymptomatic carriers to get vaccinated? A: While there were some cases of COVID-19 reinfection around the globe, most people who have had the virus produced the corresponding antibodies, similar to getting a vaccine, and therefore they are not advised to get vaccinated. 25. Q: Can people allergic to seafood, eggs or penicillin take the vaccines? A: Seafood, eggs or penicillin are not vaccine ingredients, and there is no special contraindication for those with allergies. Such people can get vaccinated. 26. Q: Can people with asthma, rheumatism or diabetes, or who have had surgery get vaccinated? A: Individuals with chronic diseases are not advised to get vaccinated, especially if they are acutely ill. But those whose condition is not acute could receive a vaccine. 27.

Current research has shown that the mutation of the new coronavirus is still within a normal range, and its impact on the effectiveness of the vaccine has not yet been determined. More research is needed to determine the impact of the mutation. Copyright\u00a92023 China Daily. All rights reserved. "}
