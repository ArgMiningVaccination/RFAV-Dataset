As a professor, I thoroughly enjoyed learning about a subject in-depth and then preparing material for lecture. The repeating challenge was to take a complicated subject, break it down into its component parts, and then build it back up layer by layer until both the big picture as well as the details became clear. As much of a challenge it was to take these subjects and convey them to a room full of students day after day, it was also a joy. This was especially true in neurophysiology, a subject I absolutely loved teaching. And I found that year after year, the most complex content to explain was always the function of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia are a functionally diverse group of nuclei that lie deep within the cerebral hemispheres. These nuclei influence movement by regulating the activity of the upper motor neurons. The caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus make up the functional core of this motor regulatory system. The substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus contribute an important modulatory function on the core nuclei themselves.The collective structures of the basal ganglia make a subcortical loop that links most areas of the cerebral cortex with the upper motor neurons in the primary motor cortex and premotor cortex. The neurons in this loop modify their activity before and during the course of voluntary motor activity. Their influence on the upper motor neurons is required for normal coordinated muscle activity. One of the hardest concepts to understand about the function of the basal ganglia is that of disinhibition of an inhibitory system. I often think about this in terms of a default switch for motor activity. At rest the default switch is on, and the activity of the upper motor neuron is suppressed. The anticipation of motion originating in the frontal and parietal lobes of the cortex creates a signal that turns the switch off for a very brief period of time and allows the motion to occur. Inputs from multimodal areas of the frontal and parietal cortex project to both the caudate nucleus and the putamen. These signals excite the neurons in these structures. Neurons from the caudate and putamen project to the globus pallidus and inhibit its activity. The globus pallidus is tonically active and axons from this structure project to and inhibit neurons in the thalamus which ultimately send excitatory signals to the upper motor neurons. Are you as thoroughly confused as the medical students were? I mentioned it was the hardest concept to get across and understand. So here's how it works. in tHiS iSSue Mississippi CAn open enrollment .................................. 3 Mississippi CAn Provider Survey ................................ 4-5 news .......................................................................... 7-8 Provider Compliance .............................................. 8-10Pharmacy .............................................................. 11-14 Provider Field representatives ................................. 15 September Calendar of events ................................... 16 Dr. DaviD Dzielak executive Director MS Division of MedicaidVolume 19, Issue 4 September 20132 The default switch that suppresses motor activity is in the globus pallidus. The globus pallidus is tonically active and outputs from this structure inhibit nuerons in a part of the thalamus that provides excitatory inputs to the upper motor neuron. The cognitive initiation of movement originating in the cortex excites the neurons in the caudate nuclues and putamen which in turn causes transient inhibition of the globus pallidus. Once released from inhibition by the globus pallidus the thalamic nuerons can excite the upper motor neurons and congnitively controlled movement occurs. Together these structures act like a physiological gate that opens to allow purposeful movement to occur and then closes to inhibit competing or spurious motor patterns. What does this have to do with Medicaid?Well, as complicated as basal ganglia may seem, Medicaid has proven to be as equally challenging due to the monumental responsibilities and tasks we are charged with carrying out every day. Much like other temporary assistance governmental programs, Mississippi Medicaid can be difficult to understand and a source of frustration. There are so many moving parts, regulations, policies, procedures, programs, services and parties involved that it often is overwhelming to grasp the overall big picture. The Division of Medicaid (DOM) has over 900 employees located throughout one central office, 30 regional offices and 95 outstations across the state, all working together to provide quality health care coverage for the vulnerable, eligible populations in Mississippi. The total combined state and federal budget amounts to over $4.96 billion (from fiscal year 2012). Contrary to common misconceptions, many people are hard at work implementing laws and policies to help make the program run more efficiently and provide assistance understanding these changes. What are we doing to make it easier for you?Helpful resources for providers such as the fee schedules, forms, billing information and the administrative code are available on the Division of Medicaid website under the Providers link (http://www.medicaid.ms.gov). Also on the Contact Us webpage there are links with phone numbers, including a long detailed list of who exactly to contact regarding specific topics and issues. Additionally, we have a dedicated team at the agency, the Bureau of Provider Beneficiary Relations, who addresses concerns, answers questions and is our link to providers in the Mississippi Medicaid network. They routinely go out into the community to educate and inform beneficiaries and providers alike, with the basics of how Medicaid works and the services available. Just recently, they conducted several provider workshops throughout the state and are gearing up for another round focusing on beneficiary workshops. In order to be able to provide better customer service, I encourage you to seek out these resources to gain quick answers to your questions. We are here to serve both the beneficiaries and providers of Mississippi, collaborating together to provide quality health care services. Despite the basal ganglia, that's a common goal we can all understand.

Family Planning Waiver depo-Provera Billing tip Providers may bill an Evaluation and Management visit code when administering Depo-Provera. However, the use of this visit code is subject to the four (4) visits per federal fiscal year limit for beneficiaries enrolled in the Family Planning Waiver. Providers may submit claims for Depo Provera only if:1) The provider administers Depo-Provera, utilizing HCPCs code J1050 or 2) The provider evaluates the beneficiary for a new contraceptive, contraceptive changes or contraceptive problems and documents the beneficiary's condition, utilizing the appropriate office visit CPT code and HCPCs code J1050. recommendations to Fix \"one-to-Many\" Claims issues One-To-Many NPI Providers are providers who chose to enumerate with the same NPI for several servicing locations or provider types. Doing so causes claims to deny to the unlisted provider number due to the inability of the system to determine the pay-to provider. In order to possibly remedy this problem the following recommendations are being offered: 1. Submit claims using a unique taxonomy code for each location. 2. Use a different billing zip code. 3. Enumerate with a different NPI for each location. Please be mindful that these are ONLY recommendations that will aid in more accurate claims payment.

Volume 19, Issue 4 September 201311 FdA Warning: Ketoconazole oral tablets On July 26, 2013, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) released new warnings for the oral antifungal drug, ketoconazole. Warnings of severe liver injuries, adrenal gland problems and multiple harmful drug interactions have been added to the drug's label. As a result of these new warnings, it is recommended that ketoconazole tablets only be used to treat endemic mycoses when alternative antifungal therapies are not available or tolerated. The FDA's document in its entirety may be found at http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm362415.htm. While the FDA has strengthened the warnings contained within the medication guide, the European Medicines Agency took one step further and recommended that use oral ketoconazole products be suspended throughout the European Union. In response to these new warnings, the Mississippi Division of Medicaid elected to change the Preferred Drug List (PDL) status of ketoconazole tablets from preferred to non-preferred. Patients currently taking ketoconazole will be allowed a two week transition period to switch to an alternative, preferred oral antifungal product. Prescribers, whose patients are currently on ketoconazole and wish for them to receive the 14 day transition provision, are requested to call the Pharmacy PA unit at 1-877-537-0722. Otherwise, prescribers are to submit prior authorization requests for the on-going use of ketoconazole tablets. This will allow the DOM pharmacy staff and its clinical contractors to evaluate the risks and benefits of using ketoconazole tablets within the Mississippi Medicaid population. Be advised that this change in PDL status was effective immediately. Preferred drug list (Pdl): Clarification The pharmacy bureau has received questions regarding PDL prior authorization requirements for non-preferred drugs. Please note that the PDL addresses drugs dispensed in the pharmacy or point of sale (POS) venue only. It is not applicable to drugs provided and billed by physician offices. Beneficiary Access Issues: doxycycline It has come to our attention that beneficiaries are experiencing difficulties getting prescriptions for doxycycline filled. Drug shortages and availability issues have created significant price increases for the hyclate formulation. Reimbursement PHArMACY Volume 19, Issue 4 September 201312 of doxycycline hyclate is based upon the federal upper limits (FUL) which cannot be overridden. However, doxycycline monohydrate is a readily available formulation without an assigned federal upper limit (FUL). As an option for our beneficiaries and providers, the following doxycycline monohydrate formulations have been moved to preferred status. We encourage providers to prescribe, stock, and dispense doxycycline monohydrate when appropriate for this document is posted under the \"Latest News\" section of the pharmacy services webpage at http://www.medicaid.ms.gov/Pharmacy.aspx.Hurricane Preparedness: n ew Pharmacy Billing Procedures in Times of Officially Declared emergencies Be sure that your pharmacy is prepared for the upcoming hurricane season.

Pharmacy Billing for Influenza and Pneumonia In the MS Medicaid Pharmacy program, influenza and pneumonia immunizations are covered services for Medicaid beneficiaries ages 19 and older who are not residents of long-term care facilities. These are the only vaccines/immunizations available via the Pharmacy Program. As with other pharmacy services, a hard copy prescription must be on file. Immunizations provided from a credentialed pharmacist will count against the service limits and co-payments are applicable. MS Medicaid reimburses for the drug's ingredient cost and pays a dispensing fee for immunizations administered in the pharmacy venue. No administration fee is paid for immunizations administered in the pharmacy venue. All immunizations for children age 18 and younger must be handled through the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC). For additional information regarding immunizations and Medicaid policies, refer to Title 23: Medicaid, Part 224 Immunizations of the Administrative Code, which may be found at http://www.medicaid.ms.gov/AdminCode.aspx. reminder: doM Pharmacy Claims and v alid Provider types Effective June 1, 2013, all pharmacy claims must use a valid prescribing provider type, a person, and not a building, i.e. clinic or hospital, national prescriber identification (NPI) number. A 'prescriber' must be a person, and not a building. In the past, DOM allowed a 'clinic' and 'hospital' NPIs to be used. Effective June 1, 2013 claims using a non-person's NPI deny. Valid provider types are physicians, doctors of osteopathy, podiatrists, dentists, optometrists, nurse midwives, nurse practitioners and physician assistants.

The Drug Utilization Review (DUR) Board evaluates standards of drug use in the Mississippi Division of Medicaid's drug program and is responsible for conducting both retrospective and prospective drug use reviews (DURs). The purpose of the DUR program is to improve the quality of pharmaceutical care by ensuring that prescriptions are appropriate, medically necessary, and that they are not likely to cause adverse medical results. The Mississippi Evidence-Based DUR Initiative (MS-DUR) performs the retrospective drug utilization review (DUR) for the Mississippi Division of Medicaid. Based on activities of the DUR Board and claims reviews, MS-DUR provides educational outreach to health care practitioners on drug therapy to improve prescribing and dispensing practices for Mississippi Division of Medicaid beneficiaries. The MS-DUR website, also found at http://www.pharmacy.olemiss.edu/cpmm/msdurresourcesforproviders.html , has resources for providers, including the \"Mississippi Medicaid Pharmacy Update\" newsletters and special initiatives developed to assist providers in selecting therapy, like the \"Medicaid Cough and Cold Quick List. \" We recommend adding this link to your favorites as you will find it very helpful.
