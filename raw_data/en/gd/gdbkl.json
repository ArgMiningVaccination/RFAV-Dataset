Then read up on our interview with Kayla Tremblett, owner of Simple Ritual Candles, located in Mississauga, ON, Canada. What's your business, and who are your customers? Simple Ritual is an eco-friendly candle company focused on sustainable, biodegradable, and toxic-free candles. Every candle at Simple Ritual HQ is vegan, paraben-free, phthalate-free, cruelty-free & non-toxic. Simple Ritual is passionate about creating products that prioritize sustainability by re-purposing materials instead of constantly creating new objects that contribute to mass consumerism. Our business methods include sustainable sourcing in our ingredients and re-purposing packaging wherever possible. A percentage from every candle sale will be donated to Young Adult Cancer Canada (YACC). It is an organization that supports young adults living with, through, and beyond cancer. YACC connects and supports hundreds of young adults across Canada. They are dear to my heart, as they saved my life while I was recovering from my two years of cancer treatments. In 2017 I discovered YACC. I went to a young adult cancer retreat in British Columbia. I met a group of strangers who helped me start my life again with their honesty, vulnerability, and their willingness to share the deepest moments of their lives. Connecting with these people was the start of my new life. Tell us about yourself When I was 21, I was diagnosed with stage 3 blood cancer. After nine months of difficult treatment, I found out that I had relapsed from rare cancer called grey zone lymphoma. I underwent another year of treatment, including a stem cell transplant that ultimately ended up saving me. As a survivor, or rather a thriver, I understand what it means to take a moment for myself and to make myself a priority. Thus, the birth of Simple Ritual. From pouring your candles to creating the content that you see on social to responding to your emails, keeping my small business local and as sustainable as possible is very important to me. All of our candles are poured in small batches to ensure that every candle gets special attention. Simple Ritual started off as a part of my healing and my love for holistic health practices, and now I want to share it with my community. What's your biggest accomplishment as a business owner? When a customer sends me a message or posts a story/shares an image telling me how much a Simple Ritual candle has impacted their day and their self-care time. What's one of the hardest things that come with being a business owner? Financially it can be hard to maintain a good balance, especially with the rising costs of materials. Sometimes I have to make a hard business call so that I can keep Simple Ritual alive and well. I work full-time and run my business in the evenings and on weekends; it can be a lot to balance during the busy months or when I have large orders. I do rely on family to help me out in times of need - it's important to have people to lean on for support when you run a small business. What are the top tips you'd give to anyone looking to start, run and grow a business today? - You have to believe in your product; people will resonate and connect with you if you believe in what you are trying to share and the community you are trying to build. - Establish a solid framework of business standards and stick to them! Do not compromise on quality and do not lower your costs to appeal to those who make negative comments about your prices or products. It is expensive to make a high-quality product, and the people who understand that will always support you. - Believe in yourself. You CAN do this; even if it gets hard, take a second to breathe and think about the next steps. Is there anything else you'd like to share? I think you should go buy a candle :) Where can people find you and your business?
