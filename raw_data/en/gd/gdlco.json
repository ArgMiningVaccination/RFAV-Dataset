For most Wiccans, reverence for what is often referred to simply as ''the Goddess'' is of particular importance, as Wicca has consistently stressed the importance of feminism and gender equality. Magic, ritual, and divination are frequently important aspects of Wiccan practice, collectively defined under the term witchcraft. Polytheistic religions existed throughout Europe for thousands of years prior to the spread of Christianity. Most of these European polytheistic religions have been lost to history. The Greco-Roman polytheistic traditions were well recorded, and the Nordic polytheistic religion was partially recorded by Icelandic historians in the first centuries after Iceland's conversion to Christianity. Regarding the pre-Christian traditions of the British Isles, very little is known. The Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf offers a few significant glimpses of polytheistic practices and the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge provides insight into the pre-Christian religion of Ireland. However, both of these texts were written versions of much older oral epics recorded long after polytheism ceased to be practiced in the British Isles. Because the pre-Christian cultures of Western Europe were either illiterate or only partially literate, the majority of what we know about the pre-Christian religions of Western Europe comes from archaeology. Throughout the Medieval Period and into the Modern Period, many European folk traditions existed outside the scope of orthodox Christianity. Many of these folk traditions involved healing and medicine, as medical science had yet to be developed. A local folk practitioner might prescribe certain herbs or protective amulets to address certain illness or other problems. At different times, these folk practitioners were accused of being witches and frequently executed. Although it's impossible to know for sure, most historians agree that these kinds of folk traditions and remedies probably had nothing to do with older pre-Christian polytheism. They were contemporary folk traditions. With all of this in mind, by the early 20th century, some unconventional religious seekers sought to revitalize the pre-Christian polytheistic traditions of the British Isles and other parts of Western Europe. These various attempts came to be known as neo-paganism. Some of these neo-pagan practitioners argued that the pre-Christian European religions had never really died out, but had persisted in secret for more than 1,500 years. Gerald B. Gardner Gerald B. Gardner was born in England in 1884. Spending much of his childhood in warmer climates outside of England in deference to his asthma, Gardner returned to England as an adult. In the years after World War I, Gardner became involved with various occult societies and alternative lifestyles. According to Gardner's own account, he was contacted during this period by a group of witches led by a woman known as Old Dorothy. These witches explained to Gardner that they were the keepers of an ancient polytheistic religion known as ''the Craft'' or Wicca. The word ''Wicca'' is an Old English word for ''witch.'' Gardner recounts that he was initiated into this religious group in 1939. At this time in England, old laws were still on the books that made it illegal to publish books about witchcraft, but these laws were repealed in 1951 due to lobbying efforts by several occult groups. Under the pen name Scire, Gardner first published a fictionalized novel called High Magic's Aid that dealt with witchcraft in England. This work of fiction was followed by two non-fiction works directly addressing witchcraft and what would become known as Wicca, Witchcraft Today (1954) and The Meaning of Witchcraft (1959). Gardner's take on European polytheism is quite different from anything recounted in Beowulf, the Icelandic Eddas, or by Roman chroniclers during the first millennium CE. Wicca is a warm, nature-loving, peaceful religion, with a strong emphasis on the worship of a fertility Goddess. In Gardner's account, Wiccans worship two basic aspects of the divine: a horned God of the forest and a Triple Goddess of fertility. Gardner posits Wicca as the genuine European witch cult that had persisted for thousands of years and existed in deepest secrecy during the Christian period. It was time, Gardner felt, for Wicca to come out of the shadows and make itself known, lest it die out for good. Wicca Since Gardner Gardner's account of his initiation into the secret Wiccan society has been met with skepticism since he first recounted it. Are the rituals, incantations, and magical rites that Gardner conveys actually of ancient origin, or are they Garner's own invention? As with all religious theologies and cosmologies, how one answers this question depends upon one's own perspective and religious inclinations. In any case, Wicca as a movement grew and proliferated, first in England and later throughout the United States and Europe. Wiccan groups are known as covens. During the 1960s, Wiccan covens sprang up across England and the United States. Some of these covens took Garner's account very seriously and accepted his doctrines as authentic ancient witchcraft. Other covens were less credulous, or even openly dismissive of the craft's authenticity, but saw value in their practice nonetheless. Today, there is no official church of Wicca, and Wiccans represent a broad cross-section of neo-pagan, occult, and new-religious traditions. Lesson Summary Wicca is a neo-pagan movement that expresses reverence for nature and polytheism. The word ''witchcraft'' refers to all the magic, ritual, and divination traditions key to the religion. Ancient European polytheistic religions were largely destroyed during the period of Christianization during the first millennium CE, with only fragmentary records about these traditions surviving, such as are found in the Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf. During the Medieval and Early Modern Periods, European folk traditions existed and were persecuted. In the mid-20th century, with neo-paganism, Wicca posited itself as the revitalization of ancient European polytheism with a strong emphasis on Goddess worship. Today, Wiccan groups, called covens, exist across Europe and North America. "}
