Today, bodies are vaccinated against one thing and another; in future, children will be vaccinated with a substance which it will certainly be possible to produce, and this will make them immune, so that they do not develop foolish inclinations connected with spiritual life \u2014 'foolish' here, of course, in the eyes of materialists.\" \"The whole trend goes in a direction where a way will finally be found to vaccinate bodies so that these bodies will not allow the inclination towards spiritual ideas to develop and all their lives people will believe only in the physical world they perceive with the senses.\" \"...people are now vaccinated against consumption, and in the same way they will be vaccinated against any inclination towards spirituality. This is merely to give you a particularly striking example of many things which will come in the near and more distant future in this field \u2014 the aim being to bring confusion into the impulses which want to stream down to earth after the victory of the spirits of light.\" \"The first step must be to throw people's views into confusion, turning their concepts and ideas inside out. This is a serious thing and must be watched with care, for it is part of some highly important elements which will be the background to events now in preparation.\" Egil Asprem & Kennet Granholm (eds.)

Palgrave Macmillan. 2014 The influence of Theosophy and Anthroposophy in Finland is approached by Tiina Mahlam\u00e4ki through the writer Kersti Bergroth's (1886-1975) life Swedenborg's and in particular Rudolf Steiner's Theosophical and Anthroposophical writings strongly emphasized creativity and thus appealed to many artists, who, from this perspective, became conveyors of hidden spiritual truths. One of these artists was Bergroth, who declared that she had expressed her whole life in her writings, \"but always veiled, covered, deceptive, quite different than it was ever lived.\". Despite a career lasting over more than sixty years and with more than seventy published novels, Kersti Bergroth remains nearly unknown as an author to Finnish readers of today. - If you'd like to have a copy of the article, send me an email: tituma@utu.fi Whose shadow lurks behind the 20th century's celebrated scientific achievements? about modern art of education Theosophical Appropriations: Esotericism, Kabbalah, and the Transformation of Traditions, edited by Julie Chajes and Boaz Huss 2016 Theosophical Appropriations Esotericism, Kabbalah and the Transformation of Traditions Editors: Julie Chajes, Boaz Huss The thirteen chapters of this volume examine intersections between theosophical thought and areas as diverse as the arts, literature, scholarship, politics, and, especially, modern interpretations of Judaism and kabbalah. Each chapter offers a case study in theosophical appropriations of a different type and in different context. The chapters join together to reveal congruencies between theosophical ideas and a wide range of contemporaneous intellectual, cultural, religious, and political currents. They demonstrate the far-reaching influence of the theosophical movement worldwide from the late-nineteenth century to the present day.
