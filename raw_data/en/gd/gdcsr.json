So being able to not only provide care but endless support to patients from infants to 95 as they grow into stronger people is the most rewarding part of what I do. Chiropractic is more than just pain relief and improved biomechanics for me. I've found this is the first step in patients journey to mindful wellness. By this I mean, patients are aware of what's going on in their bodies and why. Then with the right tools, patients can really start to live a full, optimally healthy life. I will say, moms have a special place in my heart, because of my mom. Ultimately I just want to empower and love on moms so they know they're not alone. Meet Dr. Pagnani ABOUT DR. ALAYNA PAGNANI I am extremely passionate about helping women and new families during this special time in their life and I look forward to working with you to make your pregnancy, postpartum and motherhood the best and healthiest it can be! I grew up knowing that I wanted to be a doctor, but it was my mom who suggested that I look into chiropractic. Once I dug into the profession and instantly fell in love. The fact that I can help people with just my hands is truly an honor and gift. I found my niche in chiropractic due to the influence of my mom who is a labor a delivery nurse and birthing class instructor. Her passion to help women and babies has also become my passion. As a mother of two, I get it! I have been where you are and I am here to support you not only with you and your family's care, but I am also here to support you mom to mom.
