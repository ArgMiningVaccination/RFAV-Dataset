It can often be difficult to know which way to turn to get help. When you find yourself unexpectedly in need of health care professionals who truly know what to do after an accident, we're the doctors you need to call first. Frequently it may be days, weeks, or even months before long term affects are known after an auto accident injury. Pain medications may mask painful symptoms causing you to delay getting proper treatment. An immediate thorough spinal assessment is not only important to your physical recovery but is also a critical part of documenting the appropriate information that may be needed for any insurance claims you may wish to file to receive the compensation you deserve and protect your legal rights. What are the Most Likely Common Injuries After An Accident? Neck Pain: Commonly referred to as \" [whiplash](/whiplash-injury-treatment/)\" is caused by sudden forward, backward, or side movement of the head. This sudden movement can cause tearing of the muscles and ligaments in the neck and may also include injury to spinal joints, discs and nerves. Mid Back: The thoracic spine is most commonly injured as a result of most seat belt designs. As the torso moves forward the seat belt locks and the torso is forced to stop at the end of the shoulder strap. Because the shoulder strap crosses only one shoulder (usually the left), the side without a strap (usually right) is able to travel forward further which results in a forward flexing and twisting injury to the mid back. If you were in the passenger seat this shoulder strap crosses in the opposite direction from this example, but the mechanics of a twisting injury remain the same. Lower Back The lumbar spine is also frequently injured, but the mechanism differs from the above. As the torso and pelvis move forward, they are stopped by the lap belt. However, the torso continues to move with a shearing force in the lumbar spine resulting in lumbar disc injuries. Upper & Lower Extremities Shoulders, arms, hands, fingers, legs, ankles, feet, and toes are also commonly injured while trying to brace oneself during impact. These injuries are typically seen by drivers and passengers not wearing a seat belt. In most cases, the actual damage is to the cervical and/or lumbar areas of the spine. Symptoms May Include: [Headache](/headache-and-migraine-treatment/), [neck & shoulder pain](/shoulder-neck-pain/), [low back pain](/back-injuries/), arm & leg pain (including the feet and hands), pins & needles sensation, numbness, disc problems, muscle spasms, fatigue, decreased ability to handle stress, memory impairment, neuropathies, PTSD and more. Spinal injuries as a result of auto accidents frequently damage a number of pain sensitive structures located in the spinal region. When these tissues are injured pain and discomfort and often physical limitation is experienced. Come Into See Dr. Awender and See if our Chiropractic Accident Injury Protocol can Help You?
