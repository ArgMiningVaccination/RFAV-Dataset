Vaccines in Focus: Our Pledge for National Immunization Awareness Month Protecting public health is reliant on a shared promise between us all to do everything in our power to prevent and treat disease. One of the most powerful tools to do just that is immunization. Immunizations alone are estimated to save 3.5-5 million lives each year.\u00b9 This National Immunization Awareness Month, we are reiterating our commitment to vaccine innovation that help address today's biggest public health threats.

Microbiol. 11:1526. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2020.01526 Fast forward to today and modern vaccines have helped prevent more than 20 deadly diseases including influenza, measles, and cervical cancer.\u00b9 The recent COVID-19 pandemic also showcases the tremendous power of vaccines. With speed and clinical rigor, Moderna created an mRNA vaccine.\u00b3 We believe our innovation in COVID-19 is just the beginning when it comes to the potential for mRNA to impact public health. Your Role in Advancing Public Health When we all work together to stay up to date on our vaccines, we contribute to the development of herd immunity, which makes it difficult for the disease to spread. As you plan to renew your vaccinations, some questions that may be top of mind include: When should you get your vaccines? Vaccination schedules are like roadmaps for the immune system. They outline the optimal times for receiving specific vaccines to allow the body to build immunity before encountering harmful pathogens with the goal of providing long-lasting protection. Many seasonal vaccines, such as the flu vaccine, are administered in the fall, making now a great time to talk with your doctor about which vaccinations you need (and when). Have vaccines been tested? Vaccines undergo rigorous testing to ensure their safety and efficacy before they are available to the public. Do you still need to get an updated COVID-19 vaccine? COVID-19 transformed the way we live, work, and interact. While levels of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths are far below that of previous years, the threat of COVID-19 remains, with health authorities tracking the spread of several new variants across the globe. Staying informed and embracing vaccination opportunities remain essential to help keep COVID-19 under control. Other than COVID-19, are there additional vaccines I should consider this fall? It is recommended to review any upcoming seasonal vaccines with your doctor. References 1. World Health Organization.
