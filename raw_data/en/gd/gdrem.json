Many people are familiar with the tetanus shot, but do you know when you should get the vaccine? Cases of tetanus in the U. S. and the rest of the developed world are rare due to high rates of vaccination. Vaccination is important, since there is no cure for tetanus, a disease caused by a bacterial toxin found in the soil, dirt, and animal feces. This toxic bacteria forms spores that are very difficult to kill since they are resistant to heat and many drugs and chemicals. Tetanus affects the nervous system and causes painful muscle contractions, particularly of the jaw and neck muscles. It can also hinder breathing, making it potentially deadly. For these reasons, it's important to understand when you should be vaccinated. Steps Knowing When to Get a Tetanus Shot - 1Get a tetanus booster shot after certain injuries. Usually, the bacterial toxins enter the body through a break in the skin caused by an object contaminated with tetanus. If you have one or more of the following injuries or wounds that are prone to tetanus, you should get a tetanus booster shot. These include: - Any wound visibly contaminated with soil, dust, or horse manure. - Puncture wounds. Objects that can cause these types of wounds include wood splinters, nails, needles, glass, and human or animal bites.

If you never received the first series of tetanus shots (primary vaccination series) or you're not sure when you had your last tetanus shot, you should go get a tetanus shot. If you've been injured, you may be wondering whether you need to get a tetanus booster shot. You will need a tetanus booster shot if: [[6]](#_note-6)X Research source Advertisement - Your wound was caused by a \"clean\" object, but your last tetanus shot was over 10 years ago. - Your wound was caused by a \"dirty\" object and your last tetanus shot more than 5 years ago. - You're not sure if the wound was caused by a \"clean\" or \"dirty\" object and your last tetanus shot was over 5 years ago. - 3Get the shot while pregnant. In order to help transfer tetanus antibodies to your baby, you should get a tetanus vaccine when you are between 27-36 weeks pregnant.

The best way to \"treat\" tetanus is to prevent it in the first place. Most people don't experience serious reactions to the vaccine, but there are a few common mild reactions. These include localized swelling, tenderness, and redness at the injection site, but these often clear up in 1-2 days. Don't worry about getting an extra tetanus booster. There's usually no problem if you don't wait the 10 years in between shots before getting the shot. There are several vaccines that protect against tetanus. They are: - DTaP. The diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (whooping cough) vaccine (DTaP) are usually given to babies at ages 2, 4, and 6 months, and again at 15 to 18 months old. DTap is a very effective vaccine for small children. Kids will need another booster between ages 4 and 6. - Tdap. Over time, protection from tetanus decreases, so older children need to get a booster shot. It has a full dose of tetanus and lower amounts of diphtheria and pertussis. All people between the ages of 11 and 18 are advised to get the booster, preferably around 11 or 12 years old. - Td. If you're an adult, get a Td (tetanus and diphtheria) booster shot every 10 years to stay protected. Since some people may lose the protective antibody levels after 5 years, a booster vaccination is recommended if you get a deep, contaminated wound and haven't had a vaccination in more than 5 years. Learning About and Recognizing Tetanus - 1Learn who is likely to get tetanus and how it's spread. Nearly all cases of tetanus occur in people who have never gotten the tetanus vaccine, or adults who don't stay up to date with their 10-year boosters.

These make a powerful neurotoxin that causes muscle spasms and stiffness. - Complications from tetanus are highest among people who have not been immunized or in older adults with inadequate immunization in industrialized countries.

As soon as you get an injury or wound, clean and disinfect it. If you delay disinfecting the new wounds by more than 4 hours, you increase the chances of tetanus infection. [[14]](#_note-14)X Research source [This is even more important if the wound was caused by an object that punctured the skin, which can force bacteria and debris deep into the wound, making it an ideal environment for the growth of bacteria.](#) - Pay attention to whether the object that caused your wound is clean or dirty to decide whether you need a tetanus booster. A dirty, or contaminated, object has dirt/soil, saliva, or feces/manure on it, while a clean object does not. Remember that you can't necessarily know if an object has bacteria on it. - 3Be aware of developing symptoms. The incubation period for tetanus varies from 3 to 21 days, with an average of 8 days. Tetanus severity is determined by a graded scale from I through IV. The longer it takes symptoms to appear, the more mild the disease is likely to be. [[15]](#_note-15)X Research source [Common symptoms of tetanus (in order of appearance) include:](#) [[16]](#_note-16)X [Trustworthy Source](/wikiHow:Delivering-a-Trustworthy-Experience)Immunization Action Coalition Nonprofit organization focused on promoting the use of vaccines by distributing information about vaccines and the diseases they prevent.

The diagnosis of tetanus relies solely on recognizing its symptoms. There are no blood tests that can diagnosis tetanus, so it's important to pay attention to any symptoms. You may also notice fever, sweating, elevated blood pressure, or rapid heart rate (tachycardia).

If you think or even suspect you have tetanus, seek medical treatment immediately. It's a medical emergency and you'll need to be hospitalized, because tetanus has a high mortality, or death, rate (10%). In the hospital, you'll be given a tetanus antitoxin, like tetanus immune globulin. This will neutralize any toxin that hasn't already bound to your nervous tissue. The wound will be thoroughly cleaned and you'll get a tetanus vaccine to prevent future infections.

Instead, you'll need to get the tetanus vaccine to keep from getting it again. - 2Have a doctor determine your course of treatment. There are no blood tests that can diagnosis tetanus. So, lab testing is not useful in the evaluation for disease. Because of this, most doctors do not take a wait and see approach, but instead opt for aggressive treatment if infection is suspected. - Doctors will base their diagnosis mainly on the symptoms and clinical signs that are present. The more severe the symptoms, the more rapid the course of action. - 3Treat the symptoms of tetanus. Since there is no cure for tetanus, treatments are directed at symptoms and emerging complications. You'll be given antibiotics intravenously, by injection, or orally and you'll also get drugs to control muscle spasms. - Some of the drugs to control muscle spasms include sedatives from the benzodiazepine group (like diazepam Action Coalition Nonprofit organization focused on promoting the use of vaccines by distributing information about vaccines and the diseases they prevent.

MMWR 2013; This Article [Article SummaryX](#summary_wrapper) You should get a tetanus shot if you've never gotten one before or if you don't remember the last time you got one. Alternatively, if you've recently experienced a puncture wound from wood, glass or teeth, you should get another shot. You should also get a tetanus shot if your wound has been exposed to soil, dust or manure. Additionally, if your injury was caused by something crushing a part of your body, you should get a tetanus shot. If you're unsure whether or not you need the shot, visit your doctor just to be safe.

They also recommended a tetanus shot, and I don't even remember if I ever had one. I am normally wary of side effects and try to avoid medications if possible, but this article has made me certain I am going to get the shot, as this disease is really unpleasant. I wish I called them sooner. Thank "}
