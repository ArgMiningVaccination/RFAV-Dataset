Today, Deborah builds on the last session by asking you to first scan yourself and discover what you need from your practice. How do you feel emotionally? Do you feel any physical tightness or tension? She'll ask you to once again focus on your breathing, finding a meditative rhythm that helps you move from pose to pose with love and compassion. Same rules apply: listen to your body and only go as far as what feels right to you\u2014and of course, don't forget to have fun. "}
