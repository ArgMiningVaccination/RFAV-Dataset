During 2005-2010, our aims are: Advancing knowledge: To support research to increase understanding of health and disease, and its societal context Using knowledge: To support the development and use of knowledge to create health benefit Engaging society: To engage with society to foster an informed climatewithin which biomedical research can flourishDeveloping people: To foster a research community and individualresearchers who can contribute to theadvancement and use of knowledge Facilitating research: To promote the best conditions for research and theuse of knowledge Developing our organisation: To use our resources efficiently and effectively.CONTENTS 1 45 6 Strategic Plan updates, summarising progress in achieving specific objectivesduring 2005/06, can be found atwww.wellcome.ac.uk/strategicplan .WORKING WITH RESEARCHERS We are working to achieve ever closer relationships with the best researchers to fund work that will have important impacts inimproving human and animal health. This Annual Review illustrates some of the many ways in which the work wesupport or carry out ourselves ismaking a difference. This year's stories of the discovery and application of new knowledge illustratehow outstanding researchers aregaining insight into biological processesat all scales, from the atomic structureof medically important proteins to theglobal impact and treatment of malaria.Our understanding of the humangenome continues to grow, with yetanother surprising discovery from theWellcome Trust Sanger Institute - thatgenetic variation between individuals is far higher than previously thought. Genetics has benefited enormously from high-throughput sequencing and other technologies, which havetransformed the way research is carried out. Structural biology is lesseasy to scale up, but the StructuralGenomics Consortium has madeexcellent progress in its production of structures of medically importantproteins, and many valuable discoveriesare being made about protein functionon the basis of structural information. Such studies complement research into the threats to health we face in this country and globally. The globalimpact of malaria, for example, is nowmuch clearer. Wellcome Trust-fundedresearchers are world leaders in thefight against this insidious disease. Application of new knowledge has seen trials of new dipstick diagnostictests for trachoma, trials of newvaccines and diagnostics fortuberculosis, and trials for newtreatments for the symptoms ofParkinson's disease. Research we have funded has led to both nationaland international changes in healthpolicy. The World Health Organizationnow recommends artemisinincombination therapies for treatment of malaria and the Kenyan Ministry of Health is continuing its Hibimmunisation programmes. Partnerships We can only achieve this kind of impact through working closely with the research community. Throughsupporting the best people with thebest ideas and providing flexiblefunding, we hope to support thegeneration of new knowledge tounderpin future discoveries and their subsequent application. A key issue for all funding agencies is to balance bottom-up and top-downapproaches to the support of research.Who drives the process of discovery?Who asks the research questions? Is it the researchers or the fundingagencies? We take a flexible approach,and have an open door for the bestresearchers to bring us their best ideas. However, we also work with the research community to identifyareas where there is unmet researchneed and to provide catalysis to ensurethat vital research is not overlooked. Last year we introduced Strategic Awards to ensure we could support the best ideas wherever they are found.The scope of these awards is really only limited by the imagination of theresearch community. This year wemade our first three awards, providingoutstanding research groups withsignificant and flexible support: Professors Austin Smith and Fiona Watt were awarded \u00a37 million toestablish an international centre ofexcellence in fundamental stem cellresearch. The Wellcome Trust Centrefor Stem Cell Research at theUniversity of Cambridge will explore thegenetic and biochemical mechanismsthat control how stem cells developinto particular types of cells. Professors Ray Dolan and Karl Friston, at the Wellcome Trust Centrefor Neuroimaging, University CollegeLondon, received an award of \u00a36.7m. This will enhance theirresearch programme into the neuralbasis of human cognition, work that is extending our understanding of common neurological andpsychiatric diseases, such asschizophrenia and dementia. Professor Paul Luzio received a \u00a34m award for the Cambridge Institutefor Medical Research. The Instituteexplores the underlying molecular andcellular mechanisms behind diseaseand it has led key research into howviruses evade our immune system,genetic susceptibility to diabetes, andprogress towards novel treatments forAlzheimer's and Huntington's disease. Our strategy will continue to create a framework that can support, but notconstrain, those that look to us forfunding. Our Strategy Committees are key to helping us identify our future research priorities and this yearwe published an '\u00e0 la carte' menu ofareas identified as important for future research activity. To ensure we can support the best people, our portfolio of careers DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT 2 1 23DIRECTOR'S STATEMENT 3 HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR Whole-genome map uncovers unexpectedly high levels of copy number variation.

National Science Learning Centre formally opened.schemes has been reviewed and a number of new schemes werelaunched this year. The new Sir HenryWellcome Postdoctoral FellowshipAwards, worth \u00a3250 000 over four years, will allow researchersunprecedented freedom early in theircareers to pursue their own research.Our new Flexible Travel Awards willalso support collaboration-building andthe transfer of ideas and skills throughsupport for sabbaticals and travellingfellowships. Other new initiatives werealso launched this year, notably the\u00a391m Seeding Drug Discoveryinitiative, aiming to provide funding for the early stages of drug discovery,which often struggle to attract fundingfor commercial development. We hopethis initiative will create a strongersynergy between academia andindustry and capitalise on the powerfulresources that are spread across theacademic, biotechnology andpharmaceutical sectors. In areas of unmet research need, such as drug discovery, a key role for the Trust is acting as a catalyst,bringing together partners to helptackle pressing research problems.Public-private partnerships are aneffective model for developing newdrugs for important but hithertoneglected diseases and we haveformed a number this year. We have formed an alliance with the Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases,the Economic Development Board of Singapore and the Medicines forMalaria Venture to jointly initiate research on malaria drug discovery.Malaria continues to kill millions ofpeople around the world and this newpartnership will investigate the potentialfor development of new treatments fromexisting compounds that have alreadyshown antimalarial activity, and fromnovel compounds. I hope this initiativewill produce the next generation ofdrugs to treat malaria. A new alliance was also formed between the Wellcome Trust, TheInstitute of Cancer Research andGlaxoSmithKline to discover, developand inhibitors keysignal transduction enzyme, for use as anticancer agents. Creative approaches to the discovery of newmedicines like this are vital to helpsociety address the growing burden of disease. Improving healthcare for patients was the aim of a further consortium formedthis year. This consortium, led by theWellcome Trust, provided \u00a384m toboost experimental medicine in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Thismajor investment aims to develop andstrengthen Clinical Research Facilities,which bring together laboratory andclinical patient-based research in order to answer important questionsabout health and disease. Under the umbrella of the UK Clinical ResearchCollaboration, this initiative broughttogether the major health researchcharities, the government fundingbodies and health departments. A research funder's work does not end with the award of a grant. Whatmatters is what is discovered and thatknowledge about these discoveries canbe freely accessed around the world. This year we led a major new initiative, with a nine-strong group of UKresearch funders, to establish an online digital archive of peer-reviewedresearch papers in the medical and life sciences. UK PubMed Central, a partnership between the BritishLibrary, the European BioinformaticsInstitute and the University ofManchester, will allow everyone withaccess to the internet to access a vastcollection of biomedical research at thetouch of a button, promoting the freetransfer of ideas in a bid to speed upscientific discovery. I hope that this Annual Review illustrates our excitement about theoutcomes and impacts of the work that we support. Our doors are open to excellent researchers withexcellent ideas.

Using functional imaging,Professor Ray Dolan's group at the Wellcome Trust Centre forNeuroimaging at University CollegeLondon (UCL) is unpicking theneural circuitry underlying differentcontributions to decision-making. One important influence comes from 'reward': the benefits we expect froman action. In theory, decisions areaffected by experience - whether,previously, a reward was more or less than we expected. In animals,dopamine pathways have beenimplicated in reward learning, andProfessor Dolan and colleagues havenow shown the same is true in people.Agents that alter dopamine signallingalso affect subjects' ability to choosethe most rewarding option. A striking feature of human decision- making is its susceptibility to thecontext in which choices arepresented: the so-called framingeffect. This is a challenge toassumptions of 'rational' humanbehaviour, such as those used in economics. Functional imaging has revealed a central role for theamygdala in framing effects,emphasising the importance of emotional processing. Finally, we often face a dilemma between acting on what we alreadyknow and trying something new that might be better for us. In acollaboration with the UCL GatsbyComputational groupdiscovered that different brain areasare active in these two situations. Thissuggests that harvesting a safe optioninvolves distinct neural processingsystems from those associated withtrying a less certain alternative. This work emphasises how complex human decision-making is. There is not one 'analytical centre' thatdetermines choice but a host ofinterconnected systems influencing theway we think - and the way we act. Pessiglione M et al. Dopamine-dependent prediction errors underpin reward-seekingbehaviour in humans. Nature2006;442(7106):1042-5. De Martino B et al. Frames, biases, and rational decision-making in the human brain. Science2006;313(5787):684-7. Daw ND et al. Cortical substrates for exploratory decisions in humans. Nature2006;441(7095):876-9.Genetically speaking, humans are almost identical. But thosedifferences that do exist can affectour health. With the sequencing ofthe human genome and globalefforts to map genetic variation,many surprising findings haveemerged - not least the importanceof copy number variation. Copy number variation refers to blocks of DNA throughout the genome, whichcan be anything from 1000 to 5 millionnucleotides long; the number of copiesat a given location in the genome canvary from zero to tens or even hundreds.These variations have been implicatedin several human genetic diseases,and are known to affect susceptibilityto HIV and malaria infection. Now, a multinational team, including Dr Matthew Hurles and colleaguesfrom the Wellcome Trust SangerInstitute, has constructed the first mapof copy number variation across theentire human genome. Surprisingly, it affects 12 per cent of the genome -much more than suspected. Affectedareas spanned emphasising theimportance of copy number variationin both disease and genetic diversity.DECISIONS, DECISIONS The balancing of emotion and reason can now be followed through the labyrinthine anatomy of the brain.ON REPEAT Humans are genetically morediverse than previously thought. 12 1Professor Ray Dolan. 2Functional magnetic resonance imaging ofthe brain in action.3Young children. 4An early embryo broken open to reveal stem cells.5Three-dimensional reconstruction ofmouse blastocyst.ImagesADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 7 Dr Nigel Carter's group, also at the Sanger Institute, is one of several teams that have identifiedspecific copy number variations onchromosome 17 as causes of amental retardation syndrome. Thedeletion affects two genes, CRHR1 and MAPT , which are likely candidates for the syndrome, as they are active in the brain and known to be involvedin degenerative disorders. In other research (funded by the Wellcome Trust and others), ProfessorTim Aitman of Imperial College andothers discovered that a low copynumber of the Fcgr3 gene increased susceptibility to a kidney disease,glomerulonephritis, in rats and humans. Copy number variations are mutations that are likely to have a profoundimpact on phenotypic differencesbetween individuals. The whole-genome map will greatly aid studiesexploring the impact of geneticvariation on health. Redon R et al. Global variation in copy number in the human genome. Nature [in press].

The embryonic stem (ES) cell is special. If we knew what gave it thepower to create all the cell types ofthe body (pluripotency), we mightbe able to create new ES cells and use them to repair damagedtissues. Two lines of research have added significantly to ourunderstanding of the molecularbasis of pluripotency. Dr Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz and colleagues at the WellcomeTrust/Cancer Research UK GurdonInstitute of Cancer and DevelopmentalBiology in Cambridge have located amaster switch that controls one of theearliest choices a cell can make. Theyidentified a crucial molecular differencebetween cells in the four-cell mouseembryo, much earlier than expected. This difference is a chemical tag (a methyl group) added to the histoneproteins, which package DNA in the chromosomes. Tagging just oneamino acid in a particular histone (H3) switches on genes that establishand maintain pluripotency. When thismodification was introduced intoembryonic cells, their daughter cellswere pluripotent - showing dramaticactivation of pluripotency-associatedgenes, such as Nanog .Research from Professor Austin Smith 1 and colleagues at the Institute for Stem Cell Research in Edinburghsuggests that Nanog has a central role in pluripotency. When ES cells are fused with other cells, the resulting cell may beconverted to a pluripotent state.Broadly speaking, the moredifferentiated the cell, the less likely it is to become pluripotent after fusion.When ES cells containing higher thannormal levels of Nanog were used, however, the efficiency of conversionof part-differentiated cells was greatly increased. So, although not the only player, Nanog is clearly a powerful driver of pluripotency. Torres-Padilla ME et al. Histone arginine methylation directs cells towards pluripotency in the early mouse embryo. Nature [in press]. Silva J et al. Nanog promotes transfer of pluripotency after cell fusion. Nature2006;441(7096):997-1001. 1Now at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research, University of Cambridge.MORE POTENT RESEARCH What makes an embryonic stem cell pluripotent - able to create all types of cell? 3 4 5ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 8 The wiring of nerve cells is a complicated process. The cerebralcortex alone contains at least 10 billion neurons, with 60 trillionsynapses linking them. Connectingup these cells is thus finelycontrolled. Gradually, though,research - including that ofProfessor Christine Holt (Universityof Cambridge) and colleagues - is identifying key mechanisms inaxon guidance. Axon growth is guided by 'push and pull' mechanisms. The growing tips of axons (growth cones) are repelledfrom certain areas and attractedtowards others. A protein called Slit2, for example, repels growth cones of frog retinalaxons. Professor Holt's group found that Slit2 led to a burst ofprotein synthesis in the growth cone, increasing levels of an actin regulatory protein, cofilin. This led to the dismantling of actin filaments,suggesting that changes to theinternal skeleton of the cell areimportant in controlling the direction of axon growth. Other work has focused on links between morphogenesis and axonguidance. For example, a proteinknown primarily as a gene regulator - Engrailed-2 - was also found to affect growth cones when presentoutside the cell, again by stimulatingnew protein synthesis. Interestingly,extracellular Engrailed-2 repels someneurons but attracts others. Other morphogens, including two members of the Wnt family of proteins,are also known to guide axon growth.With colleagues in Spain, ProfessorHolt has shown that a probableinhibitor of Wnt signalling, SFRP1(secreted Frizzled-related protein 1),acting through a receptor known asFrizzled-2 (Fz2), also plays a role inaxon guidance. So, as well as patterning the body, morphogens may also be important inwiring the developing nervous system. Piper M et al.

One promising target is the flagellum - the 'tail' that propels the parasitethrough the bloodstream. ProfessorKeith Gull at the University of Oxfordand colleagues have shown that theflagellum plays a critical role in celldivision and is, therefore, essential for parasite survival. They haveidentified flagellar proteins that, being unique to the trypanosome,have potential as drug targets. Other studies have revealed further chinks in the trypanosome's armour.Trypanosomes use an unusualmechanism to regulate gene activity, in which messenger RNAs are held by RNA-binding proteins until they are needed. By interfering with thissystem, Dr Ed Hendriks and Dr KeithMatthews were able to alter a specificstep in differentiation - the first timethis process has been geneticallymodified in trypanosomes.TOUCHING A NERVE We all need help with directions sometimes, and nerve cells are no exception.TARGETING THE TRYPANOSOME Research is revealing weak points in the parasite's defences. 12 3 1Retinal growth cone. 2Staining of a retinal ganglion cell,showing its longthread-like axon.3 A malformed trypanosome after cell division has been disrupted. 4A normal trypanosome.5Key amino acids in the 5-HT3 receptor.ImagesADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 9 Exploiting a naturally occurring parasite transporter, Professor IanGilbert and colleagues showed thatnitroheterocycle compounds attachedto melamine were effective against the parasites that give rise to humanAfrican trypanosomiasis. Lastly, Professor Alan Fairlamb, whose Wellcome Trust PrincipalResearch Fellowship was renewed this year, is searching for candidatemolecules to screen in a dedicateddrug discovery programme at theUniversity of Dundee. He and his team are focusing their search on a molecule called trypanothione -unique to trypanosomes andLeishmania parasites - and its associated enzymes. Broadhead R et al.

University of Dundee Tropical Disease Initiative. www.drugdiscovery.dundee.ac.uk/tropical/overview/.To function properly, proteins mustadopt particular three-dimensionalstructures. By elucidating proteinstructures, or even just theconformation of single amino acids,researchers can often deduce howproteins work in the body - andtherefore begin designing or refiningdrugs to modify protein activity and,hopefully, treat or prevent disease. Dr Sarah Lummis (University of Cambridge) and colleagues, forexample, have discovered how aneurotransmitter receptor (5-HT3), an ion channel, is opened and closed.The mechanism depends on theconformation of a single proline in a'hinge' region of the receptor. In oneconformation the channel is open; in the other it is closed. Myosin 5 transports material around the cell, by 'walking' along actin fibres.Dr Peter Knight at the University ofLeeds and colleagues have found that,without any bound cargo, myosin 5'slong tail domains fold up with its motordomains, and this globular form bindsweakly to actin. When its cargo binds,the structure unfolds, the motordomains attach to actin, and themyosin 5 begins its walk. The structure of Hsp90, determined by Professor Laurence Pearl (Instituteof Cancer Research) and colleagues, has revealed a complex set ofrearrangements that enable Hsp90 to bind and activate its target proteins.Since Hsp90 is needed to activateproteins driving proliferation in manycancer cells, drugs that block Hsp90hold promise as anticancer therapies. Finally, among much research facilitated by the Structural Genomics Consortium,Dr Udo Oppermann and colleagueshave discovered how anti-osteoporosisdrugs, bisphosphonates, bind to theirtarget enzymes - opening up theprospect of more finely tailored drugs.

By focusing on the way thebody controls appetite, ProfessorSteve Bloom and colleagues atImperial College London areinvestigating anti-obesity therapiesbased on naturally occurringhormones and neurotransmitters. All current methods of weight control have significant problems. Surgery can be effective for severe obesity, but carries a 3 per cent mortality rate. Anti-obesity used drugs haveunpleasant side-effects. Moregenerally, dieting suffers a high failure rate. A major challenge is understanding the body's own physiology. The bodyhas homeostatic set points to maintainbody weight, but it is more sensitive to weight loss than weight gain. So when we lose weight, we have a powerful drive to eat more to putweight back on. Control of appetite is therefore likely to be key to weight-control strategies.The Imperial group is investigating the hormonal and neural systemsunderpinning appetite control - anddeveloping new interventions basedupon them.Control of energy balance, eating, metabolism and physical exercise is complex. Nevertheless, ProfessorBloom's group has identified severalkey players in this system, and shownthat gut hormones can influenceappetite. Indeed, injections ofoxyntomodulin, a hormone released by the small intestine after eating, not only reduced energy intake but also increased subjects'spontaneous activity. The team is now working on a formulation of the hormone that can be injected once a day or less, as well as investigating the therapeuticpotential of other factors, includingneuromedin, neuropeptide S andPYY3-36.

Diabetes 2005;54(8):2390-5.The recent renaissance of interest in innate immunity - a nonspecificform of defence common acrossthe animal kingdom - has yielded a number of interesting findings.Now, research has highlighted thepotential significance of innateimmunity in two areas: Crohn'sdisease and breast milk. Currently, it is thought that Crohn's disease results from an overactiveimmune system, which treatments are designed to 'damp down'. ButProfessor Tony Segal and colleaguesat University College London have put forward a different hypothesis -that impaired innate immunity isresponsible for the disorder. The team showed that the immune response of people with Crohn'sdisease was much lower than that of healthy people when challenged by exposure to weakened E. coli or trauma to the rectum, ileum or skin. They suggest that bowel contents that breach the mucosal barrier may not be cleared as effectively in people with an impaired immuneresponse, which could lead to thechronic inflammation characteristic of Crohn's disease. GUT FEELING Understanding the hormonal control of appetite may be the key to effective anti-obesity treatments.INNATE INVOLVEMENT Two unexpected facets of innate immunity have been identified. 12 1A typical modern Western diet. 2Cells within the brain's appetite control centre.3Surface of the gut. 4Examining a premature baby in Kilifi, Kenya.5Malaria parasite within red blood cells.ImagesADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 11 In separate work, Dr Mario Lab\u00e9ta and colleagues at Cardiff Universityhave shown that breast milk canregulate the activity of the innateimmune system in babies. The team has been investigating the mechanisms controlling the activity of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), whichrecognise parts of microbial pathogensand activate the innate immuneresponse. They found that as yetunidentified proteins present in earlybreast milk (but not formula milk)boosted the immune responsestriggered by some TLRs, whileinhibiting those triggered by others. As well as demonstrating a novel activity of human milk, the work hasalso identified a possible new targetfor modulating innate immuneresponses. Marks DJ et al.

Across the world, malaria scientists collect information on how manypeople are infected with malariaparasites. This information issometimes more widely accessible,but not always. To date, such datahave never been gathered into a single source and linked to a map of the world. The Malaria Atlas Project (www.map.ox.ac.uk) has so far assembled information from3126 communities in 79 countries -the single largest repository ofcontemporary information on malaria risk yet produced.To create a global map of malaria risk worldwide, the researchers fromKenya and Oxford use informationfrom satellites orbiting the Earth,population censuses and otherelectronic forms of information onfactors that affect the distribution ofmalaria mosquito vectors and howoften they are likely to infect humans.Statistical approaches will be used to fill in the 'gaps', based oncomparisons between areas whereinformation exists and those where it is lacking. Applications of early versions of these models estimate that, in 2002,515 million people developed a clinical episode of Plasmodium falciparum malaria - many more than previously thought.

Perceptions of allergyhave changed markedly over time.Understanding these changes tellsus much about the changing faceof public health and society moregenerally. The term 'allergy' was coined 100 years ago by an Austrian paediatrician,Clemens von Pirquet. Hay fever,though, was first described in 1819 by British physician John Bostock. He suggested it was a disease of the middle and upper classes, and itwas soon widely accepted that only'persons of cultivation' suffered fromallergies. Professor Jackson notes thatin E M Forster's Howard's End (1910), hay fever appears as the \"embodiment of innate cultural refinement\". The last century witnessed a surge in allergies. In the inter-war years, just one in 30 people suffered allergicreactions: that figure was one in three by the turn of the century.Allergies now cost the NHS more than \u00a3900 million a year. The reasons for this increase are controversial. The finger of blame has been pointed at environmentalpollutants and even an obsession withcleanliness. Indeed, argues ProfessorJackson, Director of the WellcomeTrust-funded Centre for MedicalHistory at the University of Exeter,allergy is not just a medical conditionbut also an \"index of cultural anxiety\",encapsulating fears about our lifestylesand environment. Allergies havebecome a powerful and pervasivemetaphor for the \"pathology ofprogress\". Once seen as exclusive to the ultra-civilised, allergies are now viewed as a by-product ofcivilisation itself. The book was positively reviewed in historical, medical and popular press.Publishers Weekly described it as \"a masterful overview of the evolutionof allergy as a public health problem\".According to the Guardian , \"this fascinating study is undoubtedly animportant contribution to the socialhistory of medicine\". Its first print run sold out within five months. Jackson M. Allergy: The history of a modern malady. London: Reaktion Books; 2006.The National Health Service in the UK may be regarded as one of the best in the world, butwith improvements in diagnosis,treatment and prevention, andaltering social circumstances,healthcare priorities are constantlychanging. Liver cirrhosis andautism are two conditions that arethrowing up significant challengesto public health. Professor David Leon and Dr Jim McCambridge, a Wellcome TrustHealth Services Research Fellow,looked at the rate of cirrhosis mortalityin 12 European countries between1955 and 2001. While a decline in the mortality rate was seen in mostcountries from the 1970s onwards, the rate in the UK increased, andcontinues to rise steeply. The problemis most acute in Scotland, where themortality rate more than doubledbetween the periods 1987-1991 and1997-2001. The most likely cause isthe UK's rising consumption of alcohol. Prompted by reports suggesting a rise in the prevalence of autism and autisticspectrum disorders (ASDs), ProfessorGillian Baird and colleagues studiednearly 57 000 nine- and ten-year-oldsfrom South Thames, UK. ALLERGIES AND MODERNITY An acclaimed social history of allergy highlights dramatic changes in our perceptions of this common condition. MEET THE CHALLENGE The UK health system is facing two growing health concerns. 1 2 1Detail of a poster held in the WellcomeLibrary. 2Testing cognitive skills in a boy with autism. 3Modern drinking culture.4Women in India.ImagesADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 13 ASDs were present in around 1 per cent of the children studied,one-third of whom had autism asdefined by World Health Organizationcriteria. It is unclear whether thesefindings represent an actual increase in autism, better detection of thedisorder or changes in the way it is diagnosed. Accurate data on disease prevalence are vital for effective public healthplanning and the development ofeducation programmes to try to avert greater problems in the future. Leon DA, McCambridge J.

One in four people attending primarycare in developing countries isthought to have a mental illness,yet mental health support is oftenextremely limited. Working with women from Goa, India, Dr Vikram Patel from theLondon School of Hygiene andTropical Medicine and colleaguesfound that women with gynaecologicalsymptoms were at an increased risk ofdepression. Conversely, women whowere depressed were more likely todevelop gynaecological symptoms. Both gynaecological symptoms and depression were associated withsocial issues, including economicproblems and 'gender disadvantages'(such as sexual violence, low familysupport and being widowed). Current WHO guidelines - which assume that gynaecologicalsymptoms indicate reproductive tract infections - could lead to womenwith gynaecological problems beingincorrectly classified as having asexually transmitted infection, and could mean that depressionand/or social issues affecting them are overlooked. As such, the researchers suggest thattreatments for gynaecologicalproblems should target both infection and psychosocial factors. A separate study showed that mental illness during pregnancy was linked tolow-birth-weight babies, who are at anincreased risk of neonatal death. Dr Patel is now leading another Wellcome Trust-funded study todevelop an effective, affordable andsustainable healthcare programmethat integrates management ofdepression into routine primary care.

Strategic Award funding is a mechanism to provide outstandingresearch groups with significant levels of support. A new Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research has been established at the University ofCambridge following a \u00a37.0mStrategic Award to Professor AustinSmith and Professor Fiona Watt. TheCentre will also run a new four-yearPhD programme dedicated to stem cell biology. The Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University CollegeLondon , funded through a \u00a36.7m Strategic Award, builds on its earliersuccess as the Functional ImagingLaboratory. It will be led by ProfessorRay Dolan and Professor Karl Friston. A Strategic Award of \u00a34.0m was made to the Cambridge Institute for Medical Research for the renewal of its core support and to establish twonew training programmes operating at the interface between clinical andbasic research. An existing Wellcome Trust Centre , the Wellcome Trust Centre for CellBiology , University of Edinburgh, was awarded \u00a33.3m renewal of itscore funding. The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute was awarded \u00a3340 millionfor 2006-11, following a review ofits achievements over the past five years. The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute is the only research centre directlyfunded by the Wellcome Trust. InOctober 2005 it was awarded \u00a3340mto support its activities over the five-year period 2006-11. During this period the Sanger Institute will drive forward its revised scientificstrategy. Under Professor AllanBradley, who took over as Director in2000, its emphasis has shifted fromgenome sequencing to large-scalestudies aimed at understanding the function of genes and theircontributions to health and disease. The new strategy will see a further refinement of this approach, with an enhanced focus on the SangerInstitute's core strengths: large-scalestudies of natural and engineeredvariation in genome sequence, inhumans, pathogens and modelorganisms (see pages 38 and 49). Underpinning these major programmes will be the SangerInstitute's unique skills in informaticsand high-throughput technologiessuch as sequencing and large-scaleengineering of gene knockouts in the mouse.Two important new projects have been funded on human and avian flu. The Wellcome Trust's Major Overseas Programme in Vietnam, led byProfessor Jeremy Farrar, has been atthe forefront of efforts to understandthe impact of H5N1 avian flu inpeople. A new award of \u00a3385 000 toDr Cameron Simmons in Vietnam willsupport a collaboration with groups inSwitzerland and the USA, which aimsto investigate whether monoclonalantibodies derived from people whosurvived H5N1 infection (including Hn,the girl pictured above) can provideprotection against this strain of virus. This grant was 'fast-tracked' through the grant appraisal process, inrecognition of the great threat posedby H5N1 influenza. Support is also being provided for an influenza virus genome-sequencingpipeline. The pipeline, a collaborationbetween the Medical ResearchCouncil's National Institute for Medical Research, the University ofCambridge, the Health ProtectionAgency, the Veterinary LaboratoryAgency and the Wellcome TrustSanger Institute, will allow researchersto track viruses affecting animal andhuman populations. The sequence data will provide valuable information about the spread of different strains of virus and identify strains that need to betargeted by vaccination.ADVANCING KNOWLEDGE 15 Unpicking the complex political, cultural and environmental forcesthat have influenced health, diseaseand medicine over the last 250years is the goal of two majorhistory of medicine awards. A Strategic Award in the History of Medicine was made to the Centre forthe History of Science, Technology and Medicine at the University ofManchester. This five-year award will strengthen the group's position as one of the UK's leading centres for research into the history of 19th- and 20th-century medicine. As well as analysing economic data on healthcare, the Manchester groupwill explore the many NHS changes of the last 30 years. Another strand of research will focus on the impactof the Cold War, as military-derivedtechnologies were deployed in medical research and practice. A key aim is to provide useful information for patients, medicalprofessionals and policy makers tohelp inform future healthcare policy-making, as well as to preserve therecord of the past. A five-year Enhancement Award was jointly awarded to the University of Ulster in Northern Ireland andUniversity College Dublin in theRepublic of Ireland to enableresearchers to work together oncommon themes.

Hib (H. influenzae type b) infection is expensive and difficult to diagnose,and can lead to pneumonia andmeningitis. Although a Hib vaccineexists, a lack of available data on itseffectiveness and on Hib diseaseburden means that Hib immunisation is a low priority for many developingcountries. In 2001, a five-year programme (sponsored by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization) was launched to provide free Hibvaccine to Kenya and 11 other African countries; but from 2007,these countries are being asked to contribute financially to the programme. To assess the impact of Hib vaccination, researchers at Kilifiexamined Hib infection rates in 38 000 under-fives admitted to KilifiDistrict Hospital between 2000 and 2005. Hib immunisation reduced thenumber of cases of Hib disease by 88 per cent, on the basis of which theKenyan Ministry of Health committeditself to funding the ongoingimmunisation programme. Other work supports the introduction of pneumococcal vaccines intoimmunisation programmes. In a similarsurveillance study of children attendingthe hospital in Kilifi, the incidence ofpneumococcal bacteraemia - bloodpoisoning caused by bacterial infection- was four times greater thanpreviously estimated from inpatientstudies, suggesting that bacterialinfections have a much greater impact on child health than had been appreciated.

Assuch, new tools to control TB areurgently needed. Dr Helen McShane of the University of Oxford has been developing andtesting a 'prime-boost' vaccine for TB. The existing vaccine, BCG, is not always fully protective against TB disease, particularly in adults.However, it may be more effectivewhen used as a 'prime' in combinationwith a second 'boost' immunisationbased on the new vaccine. The combination has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in phase Iand phase II clinical trials in adults.With recently agreed TechnologyTransfer funding, further phase II trials,first in adults then in children andinfants, are planned for South Africa'sWestern Cape - where TB is rife. Professor Ajit Lalvani, whose Senior Research Fellowship in ClinicalScience was renewed this year, hasidentified another possible benefit ofBCG. BCG has been thought to workby preventing TB disease rather than by blocking initial infection. Use of anew diagnostic test by ProfessorLalvani showed that BCG did seem LIFE-SAVING NUMBERS Clinically relevant, practical findings from studies in Kenya are leading directly to health policy changes - and saving children's lives.TAMING TB A new vaccine and diagnostics willaid the fight against TB. 1 1Young children in Kenya. 2Mycobacterium tuberculosis.3Samples held in the Manchester CRF. 4Nursing care in the Manchester CRF.ImagesUSING KNOWLEDGE 19 to protect children from infection as well as disease. BCG may therefore be more useful in disease control than once thought. Sadly, advanced TB diagnostics are not an option for resource-poorcountries, while the low-cost methodspromoted by the WHO lack sensitivityand give no information about drugresistance. But a new test, the MODSassay (microscopic observation drugsusceptibility), developed in Peru byProfessor Bob Gilman and evaluatedand refined by Dr David Moore andcolleagues at Imperial College Londonand in Lima, Peru, is an affordable,sensitive and rapid test for TB anddrug-resistant TB. The speed can save lives - a patient with multidrug-resistant TB may be dead before drugresistance has been identified byconventional methods. McShane H et al.

TheWellcome Trust Clinical ResearchFacilities (CRFs), the UK's first sitesdedicated to research on people,provide an environment uniquelytailored to clinical research. The Cambridge CRF, based at Addenbrooke's Hospital, has strengths in areas such as nutrition,energy balance and obesity,endocrinology and metabolic defects, and brain function. With Wellcome Trust support, Professor Barbara Sahakian, ProfessorTrevor Robbins and colleagues haveused the CRF to study cognitivefunction in healthy volunteers -specifically, their ability to suppressimpulsive behaviours and to learn from complex input. They were able to distinguish effects mediated through two key pathways inthe brain: noradrenaline and serotoninsystems. This work will shed light onconditions in which these behavioursare disrupted, including depression,drug addiction and attention deficithyperactivity disorder.The CRFs support high-quality research funded by a range of bodies. A notable example in 2006was the study of an individual in apersistent vegetative state, whoshowed specific neural responses to stimuli, suggesting that she retainedconscious awareness. This study,funded by the Medical ResearchCouncil, depended on both theexpertise and equipment at theWolfson Brain Imaging Centre and the CRF's accommodation andintensive clinical and nursing care.

Professor Nick White andcolleagues at the Wellcome Trust'sSouth-east Asia Major OverseasProgramme have pioneered the use of artemisinin combinationtherapies (ACTs), which haveproved extraordinarily effective at controlling malaria in Vietnamand Thailand. ACTs are now the recommended World HealthOrganization treatment for malaria. Artemisinin derivatives are potent, well-tolerated, rapidly acting drugs thatcarry a low risk of resistance, as longas they are used in combination withother antimalarial drugs. ACTs are,however, more expensive than othertreatments. Nearly all countries havenow in principle adopted ACTs as theirfirst line of defence against malaria. Inpractice, however, ACTs do not alwaysreach the people that need them. The Institute of Medicine, one of the US National Academies, has called for an annual global subsidy to makeACTs more affordable. The Instituteestimates that internationalorganisations and developed countries would have to contribute up to US$300-500 million per year to reduce the cost of ACTs to 10cents per course or less, in line withthe price of the cheapest single-drugartemisinin-derived therapy. Development of a new drug for malaria has been a remarkablescientific and technical achievement.An equally committed and concertedeffort is now needed to ensure that all vulnerable people - mostly youngchildren in Africa - can benefit from ACTs.

Now, a team headed by ProfessorDavid Mabey (London School ofHygiene and Tropical Medicine) and Dr Helen Lee (University of Cambridge) has evaluated a cheap, simple and quick diagnostic dipstick for C. trachomatis , developed by Dr Lee and colleagues. Followingsuccessful trials, the test is beingfine-tuned for use in areas ofdifferent trachoma prevalence. In eradication campaigns, whole communities must be treated fortrachoma because it is spreadextremely easily. Currently, clinicalsigns are used to diagnose trachoma,so treatment can be targetedeffectively - but clinical observation is not an accurate guide to infection.

The work wascaptured in a BBC documentary aired in more than 100 countries. In new research funded by the Wellcome Trust, the team will test the effectiveness of the dipstick in The Gambia, Senegal and Ethiopia(areas with high, medium and lowlevels of trachoma, respectively).

The swamping of South-east Asia with fake antimalarials is a massive threat to health that is likely to spread to Africa, says Dr Paul Newton of the WellcomeTrust-Mahosot Hospital-OxfordTropical Medicine ResearchCollaboration in Laos. This illegaland pernicious trade could beresponsible for thousands ofdeaths, as fake drugs often contain no active ingredients,subtherapeutic levels of activeingredient and even toxicsubstances. Dr Newton has worked with colleagues in South-east Asia, Europe and the USA to raiseawareness of this growing threat. At least eight of the 14 main types of antimalarial drug are beingcounterfeited, including artesunate, a highly efficacious treatment forpotentially fatal falciparum malaria and a key component of ACT(artemisinin combination therapy). Recent studies have found that about half of all 'artesunate' packs bought in South-east Asia are fake, with themajority sampled in some researchcontaining no artesunate.The situation is exacerbated by increasingly sophisticated counterfeits,with highly realistic holograms on the fake packaging. High prices, high demand and a shortage of rawmaterial mean that an epidemic of fakeartesunate in Africa is highly likely. The World Health Organization is set to launch IMPACT (InternationalMedical Products Anti-CounterfeitingTaskforce), which is expected to workwith pharmaceutical manufacturers to make drugs harder to fake, andeasier to trace from factory toconsumer. IMPACT will also tackle the under-reporting of fake drugs by consumers, healthcare providers and pharmaceutical companies. Dr Newton and colleagues hope to set up a network to detect andanalyse counterfeit antimalarials, toassist drug regulatory authorities andto pinpoint where fakes were made. Newton PN et al.

Teachers agreeand, given training and resources,are keen to deliver it. The openingof the National Science LearningCentre at York and the launch of the Twenty First Century Sciencecurriculum are important stepstowards this goal. The Wellcome Trust has provided \u00a325 million for the National ScienceLearning Centre, in York, to supportteachers' continuing professionaldevelopment, with the Department for Education and Skills contributing\u00a326m funding for nine regionalcentres. In March 2006, the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, opened the NationalCentre, saying: \"At school we all knewthe one thing that made a difference was if the teacher felt personalenthusiasm for their subject, then itwas communicated to their students.\"In the first year, more than 1000teachers and technicians attendedcourses in York, a figure that will riseto 5000 teachers annually from 2013.The Twenty First Century Science GCSE, launched in September 2006following a successful pilot, will helpprepare 14-16-year-olds for a rapidlychanging world.

Naturally, we all value our health and wellbeing. Scientificdiscoveries impinge on our senseof 'wellness', but so too do oursocial circumstances - ourrelationships, environment, family and so on. A series of public events organised by theWellcome Trust featured a range of perspectives on a topic close to our hearts. The first event, 'What Makes us Happy?', brought insights fromscience, philosophy and gritty street reality to explore the concept of happiness. Music has always been important in self-expression and scientists arenow beginning to understand how it affects us. 'Exploring the Rhythms of Life' combined science andpsychology with live performance to demonstrate what happens whenmusic meets mind. 'Full Life, Long Life?' used philosophy and science to explore the choicesand consequences of the lives we lead. Faced with an over-60spopulation boom, could we 'cure' ageing to live a longer life? As lifestylemakes more demands on medicine,we may see a new relationshipbetween medicine and culturedeveloping. Feeling close to the speakers, audiences raised points easily in anon-academic, friendly environment.More than 200 people attended the three July events, which wereoversubscribed several times over. As a result, the events were run again (and were again sold out) later in 2006. These sell-out events augur well for the opening of Wellcome Collection in 2007 (see page 41), which has a similarly intimate 'forum' space.SHARED EXPERIENCE Members of the public and a range of experts engaged in thoughtful discussions about the nature of wellbeing. 2 3 3ENGAGING SOCIETY 28 At first sight, the idea that dance could be used to interpretepigenetics - the chemicalmodification of DNA or its proteins - seems far-fetched. Yet to see young dancers performso exuberantly, and to hear howdiscussion of the dance's fluidchoreography led to sophisticateddiscussion of DNA and inheritance,is to appreciate the power ofartistic approaches to engagepeople with biomedical science. The intricate moves of the young dancers in IMPACT Danscience'sproject draw upon both classicalIndian dance and the dynamics of cells, nuclei and chromosomes. The project is the result of a series ofworkshops run by the choreographersMayuri Boonham and SubathraSubramaniam of ANGIKA DanceCompany, and biomedical scientist Dr Sheila Ochugboju. If dance and epigenetics seems like a strange combination, how about cognitive behavioural therapy(CBT) and frozen peas?

By helping a frozen pea diagnosed with a personality disorder undergoCBT, Baker manages to be boththought-provoking and entertaining.\"Charming, eccentric, thoughtful,\" said The Financial Times ; \"Farcical and dark, and as Bobby promises at the outset, makes you feel better,\"thought the Guardian . A DVD of IMPACT Danscience is available at:www.impactdanscience.co.uk . 'How to Live' also received support from Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and Arts Council England. It is due to tour in 2007 (see http://bobbybakersdailylife.com for details).The new world of genetic technology will affect young people more than the oldergeneration. But what do they think about the application of these technologies to reproductivedecision-making? Dr Rachel Iredaleand colleagues at the University of Glamorgan's Genomics PolicyUnit ran a 'citizens' jury' for youngpeople between 16 and 19 years oldto find out where they would drawthe line with 'designer babies'. Fourteen young people from Wales were chosen as jurors; they cross-examined experts on topics such as preventing genetic disease, sex selection and 'saviour siblings'. They also heard from non-experts who had personal experience of theissues before reaching their verdict. The organisers concluded that the first citizens' jury with this age groupdemonstrated the validity of themethod in terms of engaging youngpeople with current issues in science,and that they have important anduseful things to say about genetictechnologies. As well as writing their report, the young jurors presented theirconclusions to the Human GeneticsTHE RHYTHM OF LIFE How do you get young people interested in a subject as alien as epigenetics?

Theresearchers have identified severalgenes causing a rare geneticcondition, Bardet-Biedl syndrome(BBS), and discovered that thesecan interact with each other toinfluence disease severity. Eachappears to affect the function of cilia. BBS is an inherited complex disorder, causing obesity, vision defects,cognitive impairment, kidney failureand other problems. Several genesmutated in the condition have beendiscovered; one of the latest isBBS10 , identified in studies of families from an isolated Lebanese villageparticularly affected by the condition. In a separate study, Professor Beales and colleagues showed that a singlenucleotide polymorphism in aninteracting gene, MGC1203 , does not itself cause BBS, but can have a noveleffect on its severity. The MGC1203 protein was found at the base of ciliaand interacts with most BBS proteins. Symptoms thus depend not only onwhich BBS gene is affected, but alsoon any other BBS gene alterationspresent, and on the effects exerted by mutations within other, non-disease(so-called 'modifier') genes, such asMGC1203 . The group also uncovered a connection with 'planar cell polarity',which controls aspects of cell functionsuch as cell orientation and polarity. In mice, mutations in BBS genesdisrupt cell polarity. Furthermore, BBSgenes were shown to interact with cellpolarity genes, suggesting a novel rolefor cilia in this process. Other aspects of the syndrome, such as obesity and extra digits, cannot bereadily explained by dysfunctional ciliabut it is likely that further study of theBBS genes will eventually explainthese links. Ross AJ et al. Disruption of Bardet-Biedl syndrome ciliary proteins perturbs planar cell polarity in and is a majorBBS locus.

A team from the Institute of Psychiatry hasdeveloped a virtual reality system toinvestigate the processes behind thiskind of thinking, and to developtreatments for it. In a Wellcome Trust-funded pilot study, the group pioneered the use of virtualreality - already shown to help peopleto overcome phobias - to develop anunderstanding of paranoid thoughts.Now, one of the original researchers,Dr Daniel Freeman, has been awardeda Research Career DevelopmentFellowship to continue this work. Paranoia arises from abnormalities in social cognition - understanding howpeople interact with one another andinterpreting interpersonal behaviour inparticular social situations. People withparanoid thinking patterns interpretsocial signals abnormally - believingthat everyone on a bus is looking atthem, for example. As well as undertaking various studies exploring these aberrant ways ofthinking, Dr Freeman is also using the virtual reality system to assess patients' responses and behaviour in a fully immersive but totally controlledenvironment. For example, it will bepossible to compare the responses of patients with those of non-clinicalindividuals in the general population, to identify behaviours characteristic of paranoid thinking. It is hoped that in the future, this system could be adapted to become part of cognitive behavioural therapy, a form of psychotherapy. Freeman D et al.

Thepinnacle of this extraordinary featof packaging is the winding ofchromatin into the chromosomesvisible during cell division. Now,work by Wellcome Trust PrincipalResearch Fellow Professor BillEarnshaw at the Wellcome TrustCentre for Cell Biology in Edinburghhas revealed a key player in thisprocess of condensation. Two protein complexes, condensin I and II, contribute to chromosomecondensation, but are not thecomplete picture - in some types of cell, chromosomes can condensewithout them. So Professor Earnshawand a team led by Dr Paola Vagnarellilooked for factors that were needed for chromosome condensation in the absence of condensins, usinggenetically modified chicken cells. They identified an activity - probably a protein or protein complex - thatcould maintain chromosomes in acondensed form during mitosis. Thisactivity, which they named 'regulator of chromosome architecture' (RCA),only functioned when a protein calledRepo-Man (discovered in the lab of 1An image from a realityunderground a pyramidalamygdala neuron.ImagesCONDENSATION REACTION A key component of chromosome condensation has been discovered. 1DEVELOPING PEOPLE 33 Professor Angus Lamond, another Wellcome Trust Principal ResearchFellow) was inhibited. Blocking Repo-Man probably prevents an associatedenzyme, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1, which is involved in many cell processes), from removing key phosphate groups needed for RCA activity. RCA and condensins probably act together to condense chromosomes,suggests Professor Earnshaw. Oneinteresting possibility is that RCAdrives condensation and condensinstabilises the compacted forms. Vagnarelli P et al. Condensin and Repo-Man-PP1 co-operate in the regulation of chromosomearchitecture during mitosis. Nat Cell Biol2006;8(10):1133-42.Wellcome Trust International Senior Research Fellow Dr Sumantra Chattarji and his team at the National Centre forBiological Sciences in Bangalore,India, are studying how the wiringof the brain changes under stress.A better understanding of thecellular mechanisms that imprintemotional memories in our brainscould lead to better treatments forsevere anxiety or post-traumaticstress disorder. Stress intrigues memory researchers because of its contrasting impact on different types of memory, andopposite effects on different parts ofthe brain. Prolonged stress impairsrecollection of facts and events, bycausing damage to the hippocampus.By contrast, it greatly amplifiesemotional memories, by enhancing the wiring of neuronal circuitry in the amygdala. With collaborators in the USA, Dr Chattarji has begun to identify thebiochemical and electrophysiologicalchanges in single neurons that affectthe hippocampus and amygdala -and, them, mouse behaviour.Raising levels of the signallingchemical brain-derived neurotrophicfactor, for example, can simultaneously heighten anxiety by strengtheningconnections in the amygdala, butreduce depressive symptoms byprotecting the hippocampus. The amygdala has received less attention than the hippocampus, but Dr Chattarji's research hasidentified stress-induced changes inthe amygdala that underlie sensitivityto emotional experience. Ultimately,this work will provide a clearer pictureof the neural changes that leavepeople susceptible to flashbacks ofhighly stressful events, and lead tonew approaches to understanding and treating conditions such as stress-induced depression and chronic anxiety.

STRESSFUL MEMORIES After severe stress or trauma, we may remember things we would prefer to forget. Stress-induced changes to the amygdala could explain why. 2 34DEVELOPING PEOPLE 34 The ability of bilingual people to read or hear a particular language,and respond using that languagealone, suggests some kind oflanguage-specific system in thebrain. But the same areas of thebrain are active no matter whatlanguage someone is using. Now, though, Wellcome TrustSenior Research Fellow ProfessorCathy Price and colleagues at the Institute of Neurology haveidentified an area of the brain thatis active when a person switchesfrom one language to another. In the group's study, 25 German- English speakers and ten Japanese-English speakers were shown pairs of words and told to ignore the firstone (the primer). The words were eitherrelated (e.g. bathtub-SHOWER) or not(e.g. bathtub-SPOON). When thewords were related, brain activity inlanguage areas was typically lowered,as the brain had been 'primed' to bethinking about that subject. Sometimes the related pairs were in the same language (e.g. trout-SALMON) and sometimes in differentlanguages (e.g. forelle-SALMON). The researchers could thus identifywhether areas of the brain wereresponding just to the meaning of the words or were also sensitive to a change in language in which they were presented. Using functional imaging techniques, the team detected one area thatresponded to both the switch inlanguage and the meaning of thewords - the head of the left caudate.Researchers think that this area couldbe important in telling the brain whichlanguage to respond in. Interestingly, bilingual people with damage to this area of the brain areknown to have problems switchingbetween languages. The team willnow to try to piece together thislanguage-sensitive circuit in the brainby examining individuals with damagein this and other brain areas. Crinion J et al.

People in thisage group are at risk of developinga wide range of fatal and disablingillnesses such as heart disease,diabetes, cancer, mental illness and joint diseases. By followingthis group over many years, UKBiobank will provide researcherswith a unique resource for studyingthe roles of genes, lifestyle andenvironment in disease. To test procedures, a three-month pilot study was held from March toMay 2006 in the Altrincham district of Manchester. Some 3800 men andwomen were recruited in the pilotphase. They each spent about 90minutes at an assessment centre,answering questions about their healthand lifestyles, and giving blood andurine samples. All agreed to allow theirhealth to be followed by UK Biobankfor many years, through routine medicaland other health-related records.An independent review panel judged proposals for UK Biobank to beexcellent, praising its planning andhandling of potential ethical problems,as well as its ability to recruit enoughvolunteers and assess themextensively within budget. As a result, in August 2006, the fundersannounced that the study will be rolled out nationally. Over the next four years, UK Biobank will start recruiting 500 000 adults -nearly 1 per cent of the UK population- who will attend one of a network of35 assessment centres across the UK,each open for about six months. www.ukbiobank.ac.uk The \u00a361 million UK Biobank project is funded by the Wellcome Trust, the Medical ResearchCouncil, the Department of Health, theScottish Executive and the North WestRegional Development Agency. Study of the past relies heavily on historical documents. Thismeans ensuring that importantdocuments and other materials are in repositories where they can easily be accessed and areprotected for future generations.Wellcome Trust funding helps toachieve both these aims. Robert Hooke is a neglected figure in science history - partly because of a feud with Isaac Newton, whodownplayed his achievements. ButHooke did become secretary of theRoyal Society. Strangely, his records of Royal Society meetings went missing - but turnedup this year, having lain in a dustyHampshire attic for half a century.Donations from the Wellcome Trustand others enabled the Royal Societyto buy the manuscript. The donation to the Royal Society was a one-off, in recognition of thehuge importance of the material to the nation's scientific heritage. Theongoing Research Resources inMedical History scheme helps topreserve and open up key resources. Some 90 projects have been funded to date, covering material such as the archives of Broadmoor Hospital,the papers of R D Laing and C\u00e9sarMilstein, and records at Great Ormond Street Hospital.ALL SYSTEMS ARE GO After a successful pilot study, UK Biobank got the green light to roll out nationally.RIGHT HOOKE The Royal Society has regained Robert Hooke's notebook.FACILITATING RESARCH 37 1Taking blood during the pilot UK Biobank.2Stored biological samples. 3Robert Hooke's notebook.Images12 3FACILITATING RESEARCH 38 and the mouse genome, by theWellcome Trust Sanger Instituteand others, created a powerfulresource for researchers exploringmouse biology. Now new biologicaltools and the results of geneticexperiments are offering even more help to mouse researchers. A major challenge in biomedical research is to disentangle the effects of multiple genes on complexbiological traits, including commondiseases. Mice have similar biology tohumans but can be bred and analysedin ways impossible in humans. Professor Jonathan Flint, Dr Richard Mott and colleagues at the WellcomeTrust Centre for Human Genetics in Oxford have been carrying outgenome-wide analyses of complextraits in genetically mixed mice (asopposed to the 'pure' inbred strainsusually used). As well as sheddinglight on the environmental and geneticinfluences on these traits, the resultsare also being made freely available on the web for researchers to exploreparticular traits in more detail (seehttp://gscan.well.ox.ac.uk). Themethods also illustrate the potential for high-throughput genetic analysis in mice.Meanwhile, the Sanger Institute continues to develop its mouseresources. Mouse sequence data,extensively annotated, are availablethrough the tools and'gene-trap' resources, which providethe means to generate geneticallyaltered mice. The Sanger Institute has also been awarded major funding from the USNational Institutes of Health and theEU to generate a resource of mouseknockouts of 13 500 genes, as part of two international collaborations(KOMP and EUCOMM) aiming tomutate 95 per cent of mouse genesby 2011. As many as 2500 of thesewill be converted into mice to examinethe role of single genes. All of theseresources will be available to thescientific community. Valdar W et al.

Recently, severalfacilities funded through theseschemes have opened. JIF and SRIF funding was restricted to the UK, but the Wellcome Trust has also funded facilities outside theUK to support research at its MajorOverseas Programmes. This year saw the opening of new labs at Kilifi General Hospital, Kenya, housing research carried out at theKEMRI-Wellcome Trust ResearchProgramme (see pages 11 and 18). In the UK, the excellent science base in Scotland has been reflected in a range of infrastructure awards.This year saw the opening of the Sir Graeme Davies BiomedicalResearch Building, to which the Trustcontributed \u00a38 million. The building will house the Glasgow BiomedicalResearch Centre. In Edinburgh, theAshworth Building Extension, fundedin part by a \u00a34.7m grant from theTrust, was opened in November 2005.

London saw several new and refurbished facilities opened, includingthe University College London Centrefor Auditory Research (\u00a39m grant), theDepartment of Medical and MolecularGenetics at Guy's Hospital campus(\u00a36.4m) and the Department ofOptometry and Visual Science, City University (\u00a31.5m). Some 78 buildings in 29 institutions received JIF/SRIF funding from theTrust, whose total investmentexceeded \u00a3500m. The University of Sheffield received several awards,including funding for the WellcomeTrust and the Wolfson FoundationFacility for Molecular Life Sciences(\u00a316.3m from the Trust), which opened in November 2005. The University of Cambridge was also successful with several applications,and opened its Henry WellcomeBuilding, housing the LeverhulmeCentre for Human Evolutionary Studies(and 18 000 skeletons), in 2006. Following these substantial cash injections, the Trust does not routinelysupport new building projects. Clearly,though, facilities are important to theresearch enterprise and requests forsuch support will be considered underexceptional circumstances.Some \u00a384 million has been committed by ten UK fundingagencies to strengthen and extendthe UK's Clinical Research Facility(CRF) network. The initiative isfounded on the success of the first five CRFs, funded by theWellcome Trust. CRFs provide sites for patient-oriented research in a hospital setting.Specialised facilities and staff makeCRFs ideal sites for research onpeople, and they act as local beaconsof good clinical research practice. With Wellcome Trust support, CRFs have been established inBirmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh,Manchester and Southampton. In anunprecedented joint venture, ten UKfunding agencies joined forces to fundeight new bench-to-bedside initiatives- in London (Imperial College, King'sCollege London, the Institute ofCancer Research and UniversityCollege London), Oxford, Belfast and Newcastle in the UK, and Dublinin the Republic of Ireland. Four existing CRFs will also receive support for further development. Thefinal sums to be awarded to eachcentre are currently being negotiated. The competition was managed by the Wellcome Trust on behalf of the UK ClinicalResearch Collaboration. Funders included the Wolfson Foundation, the MedicalResearch Council, the British HeartFoundation, Cancer Research UK and various health departments. Details of all grants made can be found in Grants Awarded 2005/06 , available on the Wellcome Trust website.3DEVELOPING OUR ORGANISATION Using our resources efficiently and effectively. BOND ISSUE An innovative bond issue has enhanced the Wellcome Trust'sinvestment portfolio. The Wellcome Trust derives the vast majority of its income from a diverseportfolio of investments, valued at \u00a313.9 billion (as at 30 September2006). An innovative bond issuelaunched in 2006 will add to theWellcome Trust's funding power over the coming years. In effect, the Wellcome Trust is using the bond to borrow money from otherfinancial institutions. It undertakes topay a fixed amount of interest to thelender over the period of the bond and reinvests the sums borrowed. As the interest rate is relatively low,investment returns should comfortablyexceed the interest paid. Because of the Trust's strong financial basis and long-term perspective it isjudged to be a low-risk option forinvestors. The Trust received thehighest possible bond credit ratings,Aaa from Moody's and AAA fromStandard & Poor's. The bond issue proved highly popular, enabling the Trust to increase thevalue of the bonds issued to \u00a3550m.GRANTS ONLINE An upgraded version of theWellcome Trust's 'eGrants' onlinegrants application system has been launched - and an enhancedsuccessor is in the pipeline. A review of the eGrants system in 2005/06 revealed high levels of satisfaction - 93 per cent ofrespondents declared themselves'very satisfied' or 'fairly satisfied'.Some 79 per cent preferred theeGrants approach to Word templates.Useful feedback was obtained fromrespondents, and several new featureswere introduced as a result. Meanwhile, development work began on an ambitious new web-basedsystem that will handle not just thegrant application process but alsorefereeing and ongoing managementof awarded grants. This new system will provide convenient online access for grant applicants, grantholders andreferees, helping to streamline both the application and review process and the financial management ofgrants. It is due to launch in late 2007. Communication with grantholders and potential grantholders remains a high priority. A revised version of theWellcome News newsletter has been launched and a periodic e-bulletinintroduced for grantholders. Theseand other methods will be used tokeep the research community up to date with the status of the newgrants system.FINANCIAL PLANNING Good financial management hasenabled the Wellcome Trust toincrease its spending projections. The Wellcome Trust's expenditure is linked to the size of its investmentbase. It has a long-term target rate ofreturn for its investments of 6 per centa year in real terms, and aims todistribute, on average, about 4 per centof its assets each year. To smoothannual fluctuations, expenditure isbased on a weighted rolling averagespanning several years. With itsinvestments performing strongly, it hasbeen able to increase significantly thefunding it plans to make available overthe next five years. Charitable expenditure in 2005/06 was \u00a3484 million. The total expenditurebudget available for 2006/07 has beenincreased to \u00a3540m. Levels of fundingare anticipated to increase in futureyears, dependent on continuing goodperformance of the investment portfolio. The additional funds will be used to support major new initiatives, and areunlikely to impact on funding rates forexisting grant schemes. Governors and senior staff Sir William ('Bill') Castell took over as Chairman of the Wellcome Trust'sBoard of Governors in May 2006,succeeding Sir Dominic Cadbury, who retired from the Board. Bill wasformerly President and CEO of GEHealthcare, the medical diagnosticsand biosciences business of theGeneral Electric Company of the USA,and also a Vice-Chairman at GeneralElectric. Before that, he was ChiefExecutive of Amersham plc. He has a wealth of experience in globalhealthcare and has also been involvedin many not-for-profit activities. Professor Sir Leszek Borysiewicz, Deputy Rector of Imperial CollegeLondon and an expert in immunologyand viral infections, joined the Board of Governors in January 2006. In January 2006, Susannah Randall was appointed the Trust's Head ofCommunications. Contributions to policy-making The Trust continued to play an activerole in the drive towards open accessmodels of science publishing. A nine-strong group of UK research funders,including the Trust, awarded acontract to run UK PubMed Central(UKPMC) to a partnership of theBritish Library, the University ofManchester and the European Bioinformatics Institute. UKPMC will provide free online access to thedigital archive of published articlesresulting from research paid for by any of the funding consortium. The Trust also reached agreement with a range of science publishers,ensuring that material can bedeposited in UKPMC by authorsaccording to the Trust's GrantConditions without infringingpublishers' copyright. Several submissions to Government consultations were made during the year, including responses to theDepartment for Education and Skills'sconsultation on the reform of highereducation research assessment and funding, and to the Department of Health's consultation on theregulations to be made under theMental Capacity Act 2005. The Trustalso contributed to the CookseyReview, which has been consideringthe nature of the UK's unified healthresearch fund. With the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Royal Society and the Medical Research Council (MRC), the Trust supported an in-depth study, by an independent committee chaired by Sir David Weatherall, on the use of non-human primates in research. The Trust and the MRC have jointly published an informational booklet on non-human primate use. Buildings New research facilities at the WellcomeTrust Genome Campus, Cambridge,were opened by HRH The PrincessRoyal in October 2005. Significant work was undertaken during the year to convert theWellcome Building, the Trust's formerheadquarters, into a public space. The venue, to be known as WellcomeCollection, is due to open in 2007 andwill house a range of permanent andtemporary exhibitions, a forum space,a Conference Centre, a bookshop and caf\u00e9, as well as the WellcomeLibrary and researchers from theWellcome Trust Centre for the Historyof Medicine at UCL. The Trust's current headquarters, the Gibbs Building, 215 Euston Road, London, was again a majorattraction during Open Houseweekend in September 2006. Itseclectic window displays are a talkingpoint for passers-by, while guidedtours are given for visitors keen to see Thomas Heatherwick's sculpture'Bleigiessen', a 30-metre installationcomposed of 150 000 speciallyprocessed glass spheres. WELLCOME TRUST 2005/06 A brief overview of corporate activities over the year.OVERVIEW 41 1The new 3FINANCIAL SUMMARY 2005/06 In the year ending 30 September 2006, the Wellcome Trust's total charitable expenditure was \u00a3484.1m. FINANCIAL SUMMARY 2005/06 42 Total charitable expenditure, \u00a3484.1 million, was broadly in linewith 2004/05's figure (\u00a3485.9m). Grants expenditure dipped slightly, while support for direct activities roseby a small amount, reflecting additionalwork at the Wellcome Trust SangerInstitute and preparation for theopening of the new public venue,Wellcome Collection, in 2007. Supportcosts increased slightly, principally dueto planned expansion at the SangerInstitute, which now employs morethan 800 people. Careers support Total expenditure on careers supportacross all funding areas amounted to\u00a3100m in 2005/06, an increase on lastyear's figure (\u00a392m). The bulk of thissupport is for Principal, alongwith Four-year PhD Programmes andResearch Training Fellowships formedically qualified researchers. International support Some \u00a326.3m was awarded directly to researchers at overseas institutions.A further \u00a346.2m was awarded toresearchers at UK locations forresearch overseas. Most internationalsupport is targeted at developing andrestructuring countries. The total figureof \u00a372.5m includes some funding indeveloped countries, such as theStructural Genomics Consortium,which carries out research in Canada. Infrastructure Awards for buildings, refurbishment andequipment amounted to \u00a315.7m.

This figure included\u00a3539m raised through the bond issue (see page 40). The net value of \u00a313.4bn represents an increase of \u00a31.1bn on last year. The Trust maintains a diversified portfolio of investments, encompassing equities(stocks and shares) in UK and othermarkets, cash and bonds, venturecapital investments, and propertyinvestments. All sectors performed wellduring the year, particularly private equity,with buyout funds benefiting from strongmarket conditions. In property, the SouthKensington estate made significant gainson the back of strong demand forpremium properties in London. The Trust took advantage of equity market strength in the first half of theyear to sell \u00a31bn of equities, which was used to fund increased investmentin hedge funds and active currencystrategies. This should serve to enhancereturns and to diversify risk further. The Trust also instigated a passivecurrency hedging strategy at the start of 2006, which helped to mitigate the impact of the strongest year forsterling since 1990. Market value of total portfolio at 30 September (\u00a3bn)FUNDING DEVELOPMENTS 2005/06 An overview of strategy development, new initiatives, significant changes to funding policies, and an analysis of the year's funding.FUNDING DEVELOPMENTS 2005/06 44 STRATEGIC AWARD PRIORITY AREAS PRIORITY AREAS Mathematical biology/statistical methods: all the Strategy Committees highlighted the need to build expertisein statistics, study design, dataanalysis and mathematical biology. The Populations and Public Health Strategy Committee identified a needto address training of and interactionsbetween clinicians, basic scientistsand practitioners in public health research . The Physiological Sciences Strategy Committee expressed concern about a potential skills gap in in vivo research . To take full advantage of the UK's strengths in neuroimaging , the Neurosciences Strategy Committeeidentified a need for increasednetworking between major imagingcentres, and interdisciplinaryprogrammes involving mathematicians,physicists and engineers. The Immunology and Infectious Disease Strategy Committee sawresearch into rapid, accurate diagnosis and response to emerging diseases as crucial. Networks of epidemiologists, molecular biologists,clinicians and veterinarians, and linkingsurveillance data with research, are a priority. Several Strategy Committees highlighted the need for moreinteractions between basic and clinical science .STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT At its annual strategy meeting in June 2006, the Board of Governors outlined'vision statements' for the future. More focus on the best people While support has always beenfocused on individuals with the bestideas, there will be a greater emphasison identifying the most successfulresearchers, or those with the greatestpotential, and encouraging them tocome up with bold applications forsupport. Larger, longer, braver awards Huge medical challenges remain. At the same time, new technologicalopportunities are emerging. To achievemore in the future, ambitious plans areneeded, which may call for imaginativefunding solutions. An enhanced international funding and advocacy profile The priority will be to build upon the Major Overseas Programmes, in the context of the new internationalstrategy (see right). The potential foran increased presence in India and in continental Europe will also beexplored. Reputation as a trusted and important partner of choice Highly successful partnerships have been forged with governments,other funding agencies and charities.Possible collaboration in areas such as clinical research, public health and interdisciplinary research will be explored. Immunology and Infectiou s Di sea se Population s and Public Health Neuro science and Mental Health Phy siological Science s Molecule s, Gene s and Cell s Medical Humanitie sThe following areas were identified by Strategy Committees as priorities for Strategic Award applications: mathematical biology/statistical methods - training and capacity building public health research - training and capacity building 'in vivo' physiology - training and capacity building neuroimaging - interdisciplinary networks/programmes emerging diseases - interdisciplinary networks/programmes promotion of interactions at the clinical-basic science interface.The Wellcome Trust's funding is based around funding streams,covering core areas of biomedicalscience and the medicalhumanities. Cutting across thesestreams are funding programmes in Technology Transfer and PublicEngagement (see below). Each funding stream has associated with it one or more FundingCommittees, responsible for mostfunding decisions, and a StrategyCommittee, which advises the Trust on the needs and opportunities withinits area of interest. The funding streams offer a variety of forms of support, such as projectand programme grants, and careerdevelopment awards. Technology Transfer funding comprises Translation Awards and StrategicTranslation Awards. A special initiative,Strategic Translation Awards in DrugDiscovery, was launched in 2005. Public Engagement is supported primarily through the EngagingScience programme, which includesSociety Awards and People Awards.Occasional large Capital Awards aremade to support nationally orinternationally important developments. Strategic Awards and some other large or unusual awards areconsidered by a Strategic AwardsCommittee, comprising Governors,senior staff and other representatives,on a one-off basis. Wellcome Trust funding streams.FUNDING DEVELOPMENTS 2005/06 45 STRATEGIC INITIATIVES CAREERS SUPPORT The suite of Wellcome Trust personal support schemes was overhauledduring the year. A significantintroduction was the Sir HenryWellcome Postdoctoral Fellowshipscheme, with awards worth \u00a3250 000over four years, providing fellows withunprecedented freedom early in theircareer to pursue their own research. Among other innovations, Research Career Development Fellowships wereextended to five years andcompetitions were launched for newFour-year PhD Programmes andClinical Research TrainingProgrammes. Finally, new supportcollaboration-building and skillstransfer, through sabbaticals andtravelling fellowships. GLOBAL HEALTH RESEARCH The Wellcome Trust's new globalhealth research strategy builds on itslong-standing commitment to researchin developing countries. The Trust plans to increase its support in this area, building on the Major Overseas Programmes in South-east Asia and Africa. Thepriority will be to identify key people to take forward research in high-quality and supportive environments,tackling important local medicalissues. Capacity-strengthening andputting research into practice will becentral to future activities.Technology Transfer funding will also be available to tackle neglecteddiseases. Funding is also provided forresearch into the ethical issues raisedby studies in developing countries,and the potential for more internationalpublic engagement is being explored. DRUG DISCOVERY RESEARCH A Technology Transfer initiative,Seeding Drug Discovery, waslaunched in October 2005. It providesfunding for the early stages of drugdiscovery, which struggle to attractfunding for commercial development.The \u00a391 million, five-year initiative isopen to researchers at public orprivate institutions, includingcommercial companies, in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. FUNDING POLICIES Eligibility rules for researchers in theUK were relaxed during the year,enabling scientists employed atResearch Council units or charity-funded institutions to apply forfunding. Internationally, current or past International Senior ResearchFellows, or other overseas researchersin receipt of major Trust grants, cannow apply for support through mostfunding schemes. As part of the Trust's drive to promote open access publishing, submission of published papers to repositoriessuch as PubMed Central was mademandatory during the year. Initially, this grant condition applied to newlyawarded grants. From 1 October2006, it has applied to all grants.Funding opportunities Following strategic reviews, fundingopportunities were overhauled, or newor revised schemes were launched, inthe following areas: careers support global health research drug discovery research.Funding policies Significant changes to funding policywere implemented in the following areas: eligibility (UK and Europe) international eligibility open access publication.

This complements last year's \u00a38.1m award to Professor MichaelFerguson and colleagues, who are establishing a neglected diseasedrug discovery programme at the University of Dundee. With the \u00a391m Seeding Drug Discovery Initiative launched in 2005, the Trust has developed a range of ways of supporting the early stages of drug development in tropical and other diseases. Technology Transfer funding concentrates on projects that aretoo early either to attract venturecapital or to be seen by industry ascredible in-licensing opportunities.Two forms of translational researchsupport are available: Translation Awards and Strategic Translation Awards. Translation Awards are a response- mode form of support, used tosupport a diverse array oftechnologies from the physicalsciences and mathematics as well as biology. They are open to academic institutions and early-stage companies. In the third full year of funding, 44 applications were received from 29 institutions; 20 per cent wereawarded. The mean value of awardshas been \u00a3445 545 (ranging from \u00a374 000 to \u00a31 022 854). The averagetime from application to decision isaround three to four months. The projects address a wide range of potential applications, includingtherapeutics, vaccines, diagnosticsand medical devices. Others are insupport of new platform technologies,such as: fragment-based in visceral leishmaniasis. One award was made to support workshops on intellectual property in sub-Saharan Africa. Additionalworkshops were supported onvaccine research, including a frontiermeeting to facilitate greater integrationbetween industry and academia. Strategic Translation Awards support translational research in areasof key importance to the WellcomeTrust. Nine applications have beenconsidered to date, in diagnostics,vaccination, regenerative medicine,genotyping technology and drugdiscovery. The mean value of awardshas been \u00a33 million (ranging from \u00a31.1m to \u00a38.1m). New awards weremade to: Professor Paul Sharpe forwork on the development of naturalreplacement teeth using stem celltechnology; Dr Helen McShane forwork on a new tuberculosis vaccine(see page 18); and Professors RichardMarais and Caroline Springer forresearch into the discovery of drug-likeinhibitors of BRAF kinase for thetreatment of malignant melanoma. An award of \u00a36.4m was made to Professor Alex Matter at the NovartisInstitute for Tropical Diseases inSingapore for drug discovery researchinto malaria. The research consortiumincludes investigators from across the Novartis Foundation institutes,together with the Swiss TropicalInstitute and the Biomedical PrimateResearch Centre. The five-yearprogramme aims to discovercompounds for use in a single-dosetreatment for falciparum malaria and a new therapeutic option for vivaxmalaria. Promising compounds will be channelled into the Medicines for Malaria Venture for furtherdevelopment. The Seeding Drug Discovery initiative, launched in November 2005, received 86 applications forfunding, of which eight were taken tothe final application stage. Shortlistedapplicants from academic institutionswere awarded small grants to engageindustry experts to advise on projectdesign and outsourcing options. Thefirst awards will be made in financialyear 2006/07. Based on the quality ofthe first wave of applications, SeedingDrug Discovery has been rolled out asa five-year initiative with a grantsbudget of \u00a391m. Several projects supported through Technology Transfer funding havemade encouraging progress (see page 22). In addition, several smallcompanies that received supportduring early validation of theirtechnology have raised further funds.These include: the University of Leedsspin-out, Syntopix Ltd, which floatedon the Alternative Investments Market(AIM); Paradigm Therapeutics Ltd,which successfully completed a fourthprofessional funding raising round;Celltran Ltd, which raised furtherfinances to extend its businessoperations; and CardioDigital Ltd,which received the first down-paymenton a future investment round.WELLCOME TRUST GENOME CAMPUS The Wellcome Trust Genome Campus at Hinxton, near Cambridge, is home to the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, the Wellcome Trust Conference Centre and Wellcome Trust Advanced Courses.WELLCOME TRUST GENOME CAMPUS 49 The official opening of the new laboratory space for the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in October 2005 symbolised its shift into new scientificterritories. It is now a centre driven by the need to understand biologicalfunction, underpinned by unique high-throughput sequencing andgenetic manipulation techniques. Other parts of the Genome Campuscontinue to develop their programmes of activities, and building work began on the \u00a38.6 million extension to the EuropeanBioinformatics Institute. Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute The Sanger Institute passed threemajor milestones in 2005/06: inOctober 2005, the extension to theGenome Campus was opened byHRH The Princess Royal; in December2005, the Wellcome Trust announcedthe award of \u00a3340 million funding for2006-11; and, in September 2006,the Sanger Institute proposed a newstrategic focus on natural andexperimental genetics. The Genome Campus extension includes new laboratory space for 140 staff, accommodation for modelorganisms and a Data Centre housingsome of the UK's most powerfulcomputers. These new facilitiesunderpin a major drive to make dataand resources available to scientistsaround the world. The funding award will enable the Sanger Institute to drive forward itsnew strategic focus, based on large-scale studies of the effects of variationin DNA sequence in humans, modelorganisms such as mice andzebrafish, and pathogens. The Sanger Institute has also attracted major awards from the EuropeanUnion and the US National Institutes of Health (see page 38). The Sanger Institute led the sequencing of the first humanchromosome sequence -chromosome 22 - and, fittingly, it was also behind the final report, on chromosome 1, published in May2006. Study of human genetic variation was enriched by the completion of thefirst phase of the International HapMapProject, in which the Sanger Institutewas a major participant. It has also ledefforts to map copy number variation(see page 7). In pathogen research, significant results include the genome sequencesof Clostridium difficile and the capsule genes of the pneumococcusbacterium, both current issues forhealthcare. The Sanger Institute is also involved in a project analysing thespread of influenza virus (see page 14). The Sanger Institute produces more DNA sequence than at any time in its history, but its outputs are nowfocused on the medical and biologicalcontext of sequence data. Wellcome Trust Advanced Courses The programme expanded significantlyin 2005/06, doubling the number ofcourses run for PhD students andpostdoctoral scientists. New coursesincluded 'The Molecular Basis ofInfection: Basic and applied researchapproaches', a laboratory-basedcourse on new molecular techniquesused to study bacterial infection. A new initiative this year has been the expansion of courses overseas.Two human bioinformatics workshopswere held in Mexico and Brazil, and anIT suite has been set up in the Instituteof Hygiene in Uruguay, as a base forthe Advanced Courses trainingprogramme in South America. Extra courses are planned for 2006/07, both at the GenomeCampus and overseas, starting with a workshop at the KEMRI-WellcomeTrust Research Programme in Kenyain December 2006. Wellcome Trust Conference Centre and Meetings Programme A total of 14 scientific meetings wereheld as part of the Wellcome TrustMeetings Programme at Hinxton thisyear. These included two meetingsheld jointly with University of CaliforniaSan Diego and Cell, several in partnership with Cold Spring HarborLaboratory, and a conference onvaccine adjuvants held jointly with the World Health Organization and the Malaria Vaccines Initiative. A review of the Meetings Programme was carried out in conjunction withKeystone Symposia. The results were positive. Overall, 98 per cent of respondents said that the meetingthey had attended had been good for them. The Wellcome Trust Conference Centre operates as a semi-commercialentity. It completed its first three-yearbusiness plan in 2005/06, meeting its efficiency, quality and standardstargets. Over 60 major scientificmeetings and courses were held atthe Conference Centre, generatingrevenue of \u00a31.7m. Most meetingswere scientific and research-focused,so qualified for extensive discounts.PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT The Wellcome Trust's Public Engagement activities aim to raise awareness and understanding of biomedical science, its social and ethical implications,and its historical context.PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 50 This year saw the official opening of the National Science Learning Centre at York and the first widespread use of the innovative newTwenty First Century Science GCSE curriculum, the development of which was part-funded by the Wellcome Trust. Educationalists were among the groups represented at the Trust's Engaging Scienceconference, which highlighted the stimulating diversity of individuals and groups involved in public engagement in its broadest sense, who collectively are helping to ensure science is integrated into and respected within wider society. Grants A total of 59 grants were awardedunder the \u00a33 million Engaging Science funding scheme. Society Awards: Seven of these large awards (over \u00a330 000) weremade for a range of nationallyimportant activities. A notable awardwas to Professor Keith Roberts at theJohn Innes Research Centre, for theinstallation of a city exhibition entitled'Making Faces' as part of the BritishAssociation Festival of Science inNorwich. Two awards were made tosupport academic research aboutpublic engagement. People Awards: Ever popular, 26 of these small, flexible, rapid-turnaroundawards were made to a variety oforganisations, supporting diverseactivities including performances,exhibitions, talks, conferences,debates and documentaries. Arts awards: In the Sciart strand of funding, nine grants were made for small Research and ProductionAwards, as well as three ProductionAwards (of up to \u00a3120 000). Oneaward was for film-maker Ian Knox,producer Rebecca O'Brien andneuropsychologist Paul Broks to make a documentary film based on the experience of jazz guitarist Pat Martino, who lost his memoryfollowing brain surgery for ananeurysm. The Pulse scheme(performing arts for young people) also received record numbers ofapplications, with 12 being awarded.Grants worth \u00a32.2m for public engagement were made through the Wellcome Trust's Strategic AwardsCommittee to At-Bristol to develop atouring exhibition, Generation Genome (see page 29), and to the ScienceMuseum to digitise parts of HenryWellcome's collection (the ScienceMuseum has many of Wellcome'scollection of objects on indefinite loan). Livestock for Life, a one-off grant scheme to strengthen links betweenlivestock keepers, researchers andpolicy makers in developing countries,made 19 awards. Fifteen exhibitionsopened across the UK thanks toReDiscover funding - a joint initiativewith the Millennium Commission andthe Wolfson Foundation. The Wellcome Trust held a two-day conference in April to mark the pastfive years of its public engagementfunding. This was followed by thepublication Engaging Science: Thoughts, deeds, analysis and action , setting out Wellcome Trust fundinghighlights over ten years with essaysfrom experts on the state of publicengagement in the UK. Education The National Science Learning Centreat the University of York opened toteachers in October 2005 with a formalopening by the Prime Minister, TonyBlair, in March 2006 (see page 26). Two issues in the Big Picture series, a publication for teachers and post-16students, were published, on Sex andGender and Thinking . Full text and classroom facilities are available online. Supporting researchers The Wellcome Trust hosted two events designed to facilitate interactionbetween broadcasters and seniorTrust-funded researchers. In addition,pilot training sessions were run by theNational Science Learning Centre toprovide an introduction for researcherswanting to work in schools. TheWellcome Trust renewed its partnershipwith the UK Research Councils to runthe Researchers in Residence scheme,with the contract awarded to theUniversity of Edinburgh. Public participation The Wellcome Trust organised severalevents to offer a foretaste of the publicprogramme in Wellcome Collectionopening in 2007. These included'wellbeing' discussion events (seepage 27) and a one-day extravaganzain the British Library Piazzashowcasing nine talented young UKdesigners, who created remedies formodern-day ailments and peddledthem to the public in the style of aWild West medicine show. In February 2006, the Wellcome Trust hosted a discussion evening to markthe publication of Better Humans? The politics of human enhancement andlife extension in partnership with the think-tank Demos. The publicationreceived extensive media coverage.LIBRARY AND INFORMATION RESOURCES The Wellcome Library provides free public access to more than a million items related to the history of health, disease and medicine. The Wellcome Trust also works to enhance access to key information resources and publishes material in a range of formats for a variety of audiences.LIBRARY AND INFORMATION RESOURCES 51 This year's award of the contract to run UK PubMed Central, to a partnership between the British Library, the University of Manchesterand the European Bioinformatics Institute, reflects the central place ofthe web in providing access to information. Use of the Wellcome Librarywebsite continues to grow and considerable resource material is nowpublished on the Wellcome Trust's main site. The major exception isdeveloping countries, where, for the time being at least, there is still arole for alternative resources such as CD-ROMs. The Wellcome Library In October 2005, the Wellcome Library collections were awarded'Designation' status by the Museums,Libraries and Archives Council (MLA),in recognition of their outstandingnational and international importance. Among many notable acquisitions was a portrait of an 18th-century Dorsetfarmer, Benjamin Jesty, who, in 1774,used cowpox inoculations to protecthis wife and children against smallpox- 20 years before Edward Jenner'sfamous 'first' vaccination. In January 2006, the Wellcome Library co-organised (with the DigitalCuration Centre) and hosted a two-day workshop on future-proofinginstitutional websites. Websites arekey repositories of information, buttheir transience may mean importantmaterial is lost, without suitablearchiving procedures - such as theWellcome Library's web-archivingprogramme. Two INSET training days for teachers were held in 2006, to encourageteachers to use historical approaches(and Wellcome Library materials) intheir teaching. The winning images in the Wellcome Trust Biomedical Image Awards 2006went online and on show at theWellcome Library foyer in July 2006.An additional display opened at theNational Science Learning Centre in York. Biomedical Information On 27 July 2006, the contract to runUK PubMed Central (UKPMC) wasawarded (see page 41). As part of the drive towards open access, theMedical Journals Backfiles Digitisationproject was launched in May 2006.Through the project, complete backissues of significant biomedicaljournals - eventually some three millionpages covering nearly 200 years - arebeing made freely available online. The \u00a31.3 million initiative is jointly funded by the Wellcome Trust and theJoint Information Systems Committee(JISC), and was developed through a partnership between the Trust, JISC,the US National Library of Medicineand medical journal publishers. In April 2006, the Wellcome Trust won the first Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition(SPARC) Europe Award for its work on open access publishing. Publishing The second and third issues ofWellcome Science were published, showcasing notable Wellcome Trust-funded projects and providing insightinto the latest scientific discoveries.Subjects covered included theplacebo effect, clinical use of stemcells, body clocks and theneuroscience of social interactions.Wellcome Focus on Ageingsummarised scientific, medical and social developments in ageing.Full text for Wellcome Science and Wellcome Focus is now available online, along with all articles from the Trust's quarterly magazine,Wellcome News . The Trust's Human Genome website was relaunched with: an updateddesign; in-depth sections on topicssuch as diabetes, cancer and genetherapy; and new articles on thescience of the human genome, its role in health and medicine, and thebroader social impact of geneticknowledge. The Publishing Group - International Health underwent an extensiveevaluation of its educational andtraining CD-ROMs, which are now in use by more than 50 000 people in over 80 countries worldwide. Theevaluation revealed very high levels of user satisfaction; nearly half of allusers reported improvements inprofessional or clinical practice, orimproved healthcare delivery. A thirdedition of the best-selling CD-ROM onmalaria was published during the year. A collaboration with Fiocruz, the Brazilian national researchorganisation, will see Topics inInternational Health CD-ROMstranslated into Portuguese for theBrazilian and Portuguese-speakingAfrican markets. The project promisesto bring the CD-ROMs to countrieswith a combined population of over200 million.ADVISORY COMMITTEES 52 ADVISORY COMMITTEES Basic Immunology and Infectious DiseaseFunding Committee
