All patients have received vi-tamin supplementation and were pre-treated with corticosteroids as indicated inthe package insert (Table 1). Other causes of edema were ex- cluded, and all patients had normalechocardiogram, normal levels ofB-type natriuretic peptide and albumin,normal thyroid no signicant proteinuria.Most patients presented with mild-to-moderate edema, mainly in periorbitalarea, as illustrated in Figure 1 (case 1).Of the seven cases, only one patient(case 4) developed grade 3 refractoryedema with symptomatic bilateral effu-sion. A bilateral thoracocentesis wasnecessary for symptom relief, and thepleural effusion analysis was consistentwith an exudate with no malignant cellsand negative cultures. There was com-plete disappearance of generalizededema and bilateral pleural effusion af-ter discontinuation of pemetrexed treat-ment. Another patient (case 6) also hadcomplete resolution of the edema afterpemetrexed was discontinued becauseof disease progression. All other caseswere managed with observation only orsalt restriction and diuretics, with lim-ited control of this side effect. Becauseof sustained partial responses and dis-ease control, treatment with pemetrexedwas continued in all but one patient,which was described above, despite theincomplete control of this problem. Pemetrexed-associated peripheral and eyelid edema has been rarely re-ported, with an estimated incidence of1% in clinical trails. 1,4To our knowl- edge, there were no severe cases re-ported with need for treatment discon-tinuation until now. The mechanisminvolved in the development of fluidretention and consequent edema is un-known, but may be because of capillaryleakage syndrome. 4Now that pem- etrexed has demonstrated efcacy in therst-line setting and is an option asmaintenance or early second-line ther-apy, more patients will be exposed tothis agent, and therefore more individu-als will potentially develop this treat-ment-related adverse effect. Therefore,we believe it is important to report thisunusual adverse event and to understandits pathophysiology to attempt to de-velop strategies to avoid and uncommon side effect.

More-over, the pandemic distribution ofH1N1 virus led to the preparation ofnew vaccines, which should be used inthis setting. 2 Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are often ad-equate candidate for flu vaccination be-cause of chronic respiratory disease, ad-vanced age, and poor performancestatus. Efcacy of H1N1 influenza vac-cination in this subgroup of patientsseemed to be comparable with that fromhealthy volunteers. 3Although safety and immunogenity of influenza vaccines inpatients receiving chemotherapy havebeen extensively investigated, no dataon safety of vaccines in patients withNSCLC treated with epidermal growthfactor receptor (erlotinib andgetinib) display the broadest spectrumof adverse effects on skin and hair, in-cluding folliculitis, paronychia, facial From the Oncology Center, Sirio Libane's Hospital, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.

On theother hand, the most common influenzavaccine side effects are tenderness andpain in the site of injection. For thisreason, in the suspect that the concomi-tant administration of erlotinib and sea-sonal and/or H1N1 vaccination could beburdened by severe reactions, we de-cided to analyze the incidence of localand systemic side effects in our series. So far, we evaluated 14 patients treated with erlotinib for advancedNSCLC who received 11 administra-tions of seasonal vaccine Inc., Basel,Switzerland). Data were amedian time of 30 days (range, 15- 45days) from vaccination by telephone in-terviews to avoid the omission of unso-licited reports. All patients were receiving erlo- tinib (150 mg: patients; 100 mg: 8patients) since /H1101112 months (range, 1-32 months). Six patients had grade 1 skinrash, one had alopecia grade 1, and onehad vaginal mucositis grade 1 beforevaccine administration. Neither local nor systemic adverse events were recorded after the vaccina-tion, except for one patient who referred agrade 1 pain in the site of injection lastingfor 1 day and for another who had skin FIGURE 1.

Immunogenicity was not assessed. Noneof the patients developed influenza. In conclusion, we did not observe any relevant toxicity in patients withNSCLC treated with concomitant influ-enza vaccination and erlotinib. Althoughinfluenza vaccines are not devoid ofrisk, these data could assure cliniciansand patients that they are safe for thissubset of patients.

Adjuvant Chemotherapy in New Stage II pN0 Non-small Cell Lung Cancer: A New Issue for a Case-By-Case Decision Making Process To the Editor: The seventh edition of the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) classication1has raised some new issues in the adjuvant chemotherapy decision-making process. Previously, pN0 tumors /H110225c m were classied as stage Ib. In the newclassication, they become stage IIa(/H110225 but /H113497 cm) or stage IIb (/H110227 cm) because of a poorer prognosis thansmaller pN0 tumors. According to this observation and consistent with the Cancer-Care-OntarioProgram and the American Society ofClinical Oncology guide-lines (based onthe sixth TNM edition), 2patients with new stage II pN0 disease should beinformed on their prognosis, and adju-vant chemotherapy could be proposed asan individual option. This issue should be carefully dis- cussed for a case-by-case decision, ac-cording to the available information. Inthe absence of evidence-based data, weunderline the lack of denitive informa-tion on the effect of adjuvant chemother-apy in patients with pN0 nonsmall celllung cancer (NSCLC), irrespective of tu-mor size. As a matter of fact, this is true not only for patients with sixth TNM stage Ib tumors but also for patients with sixthTNM pT3 pN0 disease. Although the lat-ter population was gathered together withpatients with T1-T2 pN1 disease in stageII and, so, considered for adjuvant chemo-therapy according to ASCO guidelines, acritical appraisal to this topic from anextensive review of the literature showedthe absence of evidence-based data on theefcacy of adjuvant chemotherapy forsixth TNM pT3 pN0 tumors. 3 Nevertheless, data from the CALGB 9633 phase III randomized trial shouldalso be shared with the patient. This trialdid not observe a signicant survival ad-vantage in patients with sixth TNM stageIb NSCLC, but it was underpowered toanswer this question in the population ofnew stage II pN0 tumors, i.e., /H110225 cm. Interestingly, in the subgroup of patientswith/H110224 cm disease (196 patients: 99 patients in the treatment arm and 97 pa-tients in the control arm), there were asignicant advantage survival(hazard ratio: interval: 0.49 The lack of data in pT3 pN0 tumors and the shift from stage I to stage II ofpatients with /H110225 cm pN0 NSCLC raise the need for information on the effects of adjuvant chemotherapy in this subset ofpatients. Major efforts to run a prospectivephase III trial to answer this question andto select the subset of patients with higherprobability to benet from this treatment(if any) are warranted.
