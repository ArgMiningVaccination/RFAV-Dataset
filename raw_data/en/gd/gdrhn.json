All students who attend chapel can expect diversity in music and in shared experience of the gospel message.

It is our expectation that, through chapel, students will understand that the gospel is not just the ticket that got you in, it is also what sustains your life. Tuesday chapel services are also streamed live and past services can be viewed on the HSU YouTube Channel. Worship Opportunities In addition to our regular chapel services, HSU provides additional opportunities to worship during Christian holidays and at other special times. Worship teams are organized and arranged through our School of Music. Interested musicians and singers are always encouraged to help us praise God!
