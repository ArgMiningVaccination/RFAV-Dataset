A homogeneous mixture of poly (caprol actone) (PCL) and curcumin was blended using cryomilling as an alternative to the solvent mix ing method. Cryomilling was selected due to its faster processing time and reduced cost of materials in comparison to the solvent method. X -ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the resulting mixture to determine the efficacy of cryomilling as an option for blending curcumin and PCL powders. In addition to cryomilling, compression molding was selected as the manufacturing method to allow for the creation of implant molds featuring threaded geometry on the millirod surface. Implants were subsequentl y evaluated in vitro for 30 days. Curcumin loade d millirod implants with complex threaded surface geometry were found to have a higher , but not significant, percent mass loss after degradation and average daily curcumin release than the cylindrical implants. It can be conclude d that the utilization of cryomilling for the creation of curcumin loaded implants in bulk is an easier to manipulate and more cost effective method of combining PCL and curcumin without sacrificing implant effectiveness. 1 CHAPTER I: GENERAL INTRODUCTION Diabetic neuropathy stems from nerve damage caused by elevated blood sugar levels for a prolonged period of time. Neuropathy in diabetics usually manifests in the legs and feet and the resulting pain is difficult to manage [1 -4]. Curre nt accepted anti -inflammatory agents to pain, such as tricyclic antidepressants, pregabalin, or duloxetine, carry negative side effects including dizziness, weight gain, or arrhythmias [1] . There is a need for an active treatment to help with the management of pain caused by neuropathy that gives patients better pain relief without the negative side effects. Curcumin is a natural polyphenolic found in turmeric ( Curcuma longa) that has been shown to disrupt inflammatory pathways in cells [5 -7]. Additional studies have linked curcumin modulation of curcumin to anti -oxidant factors [8] . The ability for modulation of these pathways is increasingly important as diabetes and inflammation are linked [9, 10] . The major challenge facing curcumi n as a viable anti -inflammatory agent is its low bioavailability due to poor absorption and rapid metabolism of the compound when ingested [11]. Therefore it is necessary to encapsulate curcumin in order to ensure that the compound maintains its effectiven ess as an anti -inflammatory agent. Encapsulation would protect the compound from premature release into the body and allows for continued release over the life of the implant. To increase the drug effectiveness, curcumin should not be introduced to the bod y orally, but rather implanted locally to the site of discomfort or intraperitoneally [12- 14]. Previous work has successfully created cylindrical curcumin implants [14] , but little work has been done on the effect of different geometries on drug release r ate. Other studies have linked an increased surface area to higher implant degradation and drug release rates 2 [15]. Bansal et al. did an in vivo evaluation of curcumin loaded polymer implants in subcutaneous tissue in rats to confirm its effectiveness as a chemopreventive delivery system [16]. By modifying the shape of the implant to increase surface area, the release rate of the dose can be customized. The proposed implant geometry for this research is a cylinder with a threaded surface feature, allowing f or additional surface area while maintaining ease of manufacture. The rationale for using a threaded implant geometry is that the implant shape increases surface area while providing texture for the implant to anchor to the fascia connective tissues in the body to reduce implant mobility after insertion. Fabrication of this implant was done via compression molding using poly (caprolactone) acid (PCL) incorporated with curcumin. Curcumin was encapsulated with molded PCL to achieve controlled sustained releas e at the implant site. PCL is a Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved polymer for human clinical use due to its proven biocompatibility and low toxicity. This product does not accumulate in vital organs and is created in the process of carbohydrate metabolism. Controlling the surface area of the implant will regulate drug release. One combination ratio of curcumin and PCL was fabricated: types: threaded or cylindrical. The drug load percentage was selected from the previously tested loading range of 2- 50%, of which drug loads greater than 10% had constant drug release [14] . In order to have the curcumin suspended in the PCL, samples were cryomilled to reduce particle size and blend the two components. The resulting polymer -curcumin mixture underwent compression molding at 71 \u00b0C . Samples were then extracted from the mold and processed to remove any flash or residual material. 3 Implants were then placed in amber vials in a solution of 10 mLs phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.4) and supplemented with 10% v/v bovine calf serum to simulate the body environment. Vials were incubated at 37\u00b0 C on a shaker table at 150 rpm. Implant media was changed every 48 hours and the implants were weighed to determine total percen t mass loss. Degradation media was analyzed via spectrophotometer to confirm average curcumin release per day of degradation. XRD analysis of the cryomilled curcumin polymer mix retained a key characteristic peak of curcumin near the 10\u00b0 mark. This peak w as not present in the solvent mixed curcumin and PCL indicating that cryomilling does not mask the major characteristic peak of curcumin to the extent that solvent mixing does. The results from the degradation showed that the degradation of the threaded ge ometry implant had a significant increase in the percent mass loss and the average daily release of curcumin over cylindrical curcumin loaded implants. Thesis Organization The format of this thesis is as follows. Chapter 2 is a literature review encompassing previous research involving curcumin as an anti -inflammatory agent, curcumin based implants, and evaluation of created implants. Chapter 3 covers previous research relat ed to drug delivery systems that led to this project. Chapter 4 contains the manuscript to be submitted to the Journal of Manufacturing Processes and covers the main experiment of this thesis outlining the effect of geometry shape on in vitro degradation behavior of curcumin implants. A general conclusion can be found in Chapter 4 in addition to future work. 4 CHAPTER II: LITERATURE REVIEW 2. 1 Painful Diabetic Neuropathy According to the American Diabetes Association, 30 million Americans have diabetes and 60- 70% of diabetics suffer from diabetic neuropathy [17] . Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is associated with numbness in the legs and feet, but can be described as a stabbing or burning sensation in severe cases. Although the pain from PDN is not life threatening, it does impact a diabetic's quality of life as numbness can lead to an increased risk of falling, ulcers or amputation [18, 19] . Neuropathy in diabetics is c aused by the increased demand of nerve endings in the body due to elevated glucose levels in the blood for an extended period of time. The excess glucose in the cell system results in additional glycolysis that can overload the electron transport chain res ulting in the creation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [20] . Increased flux through different signaling pathways also result in oxidative stress and inflammatory injury [20, 21] . 2.2 Synthetic Drugs Used for Painful Diabetic Neuropathy Complete relief for diabetic neuropathy pain is difficult to achieve, as there are no treatments currently on the market that relieve associated pain completely. Since PDN is highly correlated to hyperglycemia, strategies to control a patient's glycemic index are generall y considered the first step in PDN management [1, 22, 23] . However, certain kinds of antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs have had some effect on reducing pain perception in patients. 5 Tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline work by preventing reup take of noradrenaline and serotonin in the brain, allowing these neurotransmitters to collect and effectively block pain signals along the spinal cord [24] . Like most antidepressants, determining actual dosage requires trial and error and patients may not see any changes in pain for several weeks after starting the medication. Amitriptyline is not without its side effects which can include dizziness, dry mouth, and weight gain [25- 27]. More serious side effects can include seizures, hallucinations, or hyper sensitivity syndrome [28, 29] . Antiepileptic drugs are also currently being used to manage neuropathy pain. Some commonly prescribed antiepileptics for PDN include gabapentin and pregabalin. Gabapentin is well tolerated medication with minor side effects such as drowsiness. However a crossover study comparing gabapentin and amitriptyline for PDN pain relief found amitriptyline to provide greater pain relief [30] . Pregabalin is another commonly prescribed medication for the treatment of PDN, and while it is mostly well tolerated, it has rare side effects that include acute renal failure and acute angle glaucoma [1] . As previously mentioned, pain relief for diabetic neuropathy is difficult to manage, even with the introduction of an antidepressant or antiepil eptic drug. In many of the studies looking at the efficacy of these drugs for mitigating PDN pain, a drug therapy is considered successful with a 50% reduction in pain [1] . Current offerings leave patients with PDN having to trade off potentially serious s ide effects for incomplete pain management. 2.3 Non -Pharmaceutical Alternatives 2.3.1 Capsaicin 6 Several studies have analyzed the efficacy of topical capsaicin creams to help treat PDN symptoms. Capsaicin is responsible for the pungent trigeminal sense of heat during consumption of peppers. Repeated application of capsaicin to skin has been shown to inactivate nociceptors resulting in decreased sensitivity to heat and mechanical stimuli [31] . However, application of creams must be done using gloves to reduce the risk of cross contamination of capsaicin to other parts of the body, such as the face. Introduction of capsaicin to open wounds is not recommended and patients may experience localized burning or stinging at the application site during the first we ek of treatment [1] . A review of capsaicin efficacy found moderate improvements in treatment of neuropathic pain, but stated that capsaicin creams may be better as an adjunct therapy or sole therapy for patients who are intolerant of other types of pain ma nagement [32] . 2.3.2 Traditional Chinese Medicine Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is an ancient form of healthcare in China that utilizes herbal medicines in addition to acupuncture and massage [33] . Over 80 herbal medicines have been characterized wi th antidiabetic effects, 10 of which are frequently used for diabetes and related complications [34, 35] . The main compound prescribed for diabetes is astragali, which is derived from Astragalus membranceus [36] . The active polysaccharides in R. astragali are thought to modulate hypoglycemia in patients in addition to having an anti -inflammatory effect by disrupting several different inflammatory pathways [9]. Ginseng ( Radix ginseng) is another common TCM that is used for management of hyperglycem ia through increased production and sensitivity to insulin [37] . However the largest challenge facing the herbal component of TCM is acceptance and quantification of 7 the effects of herbal remedies. Future use of these homeopathic remedies depends heavily on the validation and analysis of active compounds in TCM through modern evaluation techniques and controlled studies. 2.3.3 Curcumin Curcumin is a minor component found in the spice turmeric. Curcuminoids, consisting primarily of curcumin and up roughly 2% -9% of turmeric and can be extracted in a variety of means [38] . As a drug, curcumin has been shown to be an effective anti -inflammatory agent in previous studies for a variety of diseases including cancer and cardiovascular disease [39- 41]. Curcumin has also shown anti hyperglycemic effects in previous studies with type 2 diabetics [42] . As mentioned earlier, control of a patient's glycemic index is a key component to managing PDN. However, curcumin is rapidly metabolized into glucuronides and curcumin sulfates by the body when orally ingested, requiring large initial doses to be ingested for therapeutic effects to be seen [43] . Cheng et al. reported no dose limiting toxicity at 8,000 mg/day of curcumin, and similar studies confirm n o toxicity at dosages as high as 12,000 mg/day [44, 45]. Analysis of serum concentrations in humans taking 8,000 mg doses showed a peak concentration of 3.6 M of curcumin one hour after oral intake which then held steady at 0.6 M for the next 20 hours [44] . This facilitates the need to encapsulate curcumin to ensure that the active compounds remain effective systemically. Attachment of curcumin to other components like liposomes, polymers and surfactants have been shown to reduce the degradation of curc umin [46]. An implantation device loaded with curcumin and placed 8 subcutaneously or intraperitoneally in the body would bypass the digestive system and liver and allow for higher curcumin levels in plasma [47] . 2.5 Cryomilling In order to create an effective polymer -drug matrix, previous curcumin implant studies have utilized solvent evaporation to encapsulate the hydrophobic spice [14, 48- 50]. This method requires that the curcumin be dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM) while the polymer be dissolved in ethanol. These two solutions would then be mixed together and their solvents would be evaporated off overnight [14] . In order to more rapidly create a polymer -drug matrix, cryomilling can be used to reduce the processing time to under an hour, depending on the parameters set. Cryomilling subjects samples to low temperatures through the use of liquid nitrogen. At this low temperature, materials are beyond their crystalline point making them very brittle. Cryomilling utilizes this k ey material property change to mix and refine the particle size. One of the large advantages to utilizing cryomilling is that no solvents are required for mixing, especially since both ethanol and DCM can be hazardous when handled [51, 52] . Using a solvent also runs the risk of having residual solvent remain in the PCL and curcumin mixture. Gupta et al. evaluated the residual levels of DCM in solvent mixed PCL and curcumin via GC-MS and found no DCM at a detection level of <1.6 ppm [15] . Estimates of the co st of liquid nitrogen have been previously stated as $1/L [53]. However, the cost of li quid nitrogen to operate the cry omill from the Iowa State Chemistry Stores is $0.85/ L. In comparison, 200 proof ethanol and dicholormethane currently go for $100/L and $58/L respectively when purchased through Sigma Aldrich (does not include cost of shipping) . Using the small 9 benchtop cryomill Mill 6770 (Metuchen, NJ, USA)] 2L of liquid nitrogen can process 5.70 g of PCL and curcumin mixture. This is enough to fabricate 72 threaded geometry implants for a cost of $0.023 per implant. To solvent mix the same mass of PCL and curcumin, about 12.60 mL of dicholormethane and 6 mL of ethanol are required to dissolve the individual implant components prior to combination. This would produce 72 threaded geometry implants at a cost of $0.023 per implant but does not include additional waiting costs incurred for solvent evaporation. Previous work has looked at the efficacy of c reating large quantities of curcumin and polymer blends via cryomilling [54] . Based on their findings, Wegiel et al. determined cryomilling was an effective method of creating amorphous curcumin and polymer powders in large quantities. However, no mixing of PCL and curcumin was done in this study. 2.6 Drug Delivery Implants Figure 2.1: Types of implantable drug delivery systems, their implantation devices, and example in vivo implantation locations [55] . Wolinsky (2012) 10 2.6.1 Implants The previously mentioned pharmaceutical solutions for PDN pain management are administered in a form that is taken orally. This route normally results in the metabolism of the drug in the liver and is transported through the body via the bloodstream. However, a growing trend in drug delivery systems research is the investigation of drug loaded implantable or injectable self -assembling devices as a method to deliver more effective doses to the area of need. After implantation, the device degrades, simultaneousl y releasing the loaded drug into the immediate area. An implant specifically designed for diabetic neuropathy pain relief would ideally be designed to be minimally invasive, easy to insert into the target area, and provide effective relief for an extended period of time. There are several different types of implants currently being researched for drug delivery applications that could be used for PDN management including hydrogels, films, wafers and millirods. Some of the drug delivery options, implant locat ions, and implant devices can be found in Figure 2.1. 2.6.2 Hydrogels Hydrogels are composed of hydrophilic polymer chains that can absorb large amounts of water and can be made in stable or degradable forms [56] . There is no set chemical formulation that characterizes a hydrogel , as many different material combinations can be utilized to obtain a hydrogel with the desired l iquid loading characteristics [57-59].These gels are easily mixed with small molecule hydrophilic drugs, and inclusion of hydrophobic domains within a hydrogel can help with the dispersion of hydrophobic drugs [60] . Applications for hydrogels in drug delivery include cancer and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Localized delivery of chemotherapeutics would minimize 11 damage t o healthy cells as some anti- cancer drugs cannot distinguish between cancer cells and normal cell tissue [61] . Guo et al. created a linoleic acid conjugated poloxamer hydrogel for the application of long term delivery of anti -cancer drugs resulting in the disruption of Akt 1 signals [62] . Similarly, chitosan hydrogels loaded with a variety of anti -cancer drugs including paclitaxel and camptothecin have been evaluated as alternative delivery mechanisms in different cancer types with some success in vitro and in vivo [63, 64] . In another application, a negatively charged ascorbyl palmate hydrogel was created for the delivery of anti -inflammatory drugs for IBD treatment [65] . Evaluation of the hydrogel in mice found a decreased severity of the disease in mice treated with the drug loaded hydrogel. Utilization of the hydrogel also limited the spread of the anti- inflammatory drugs to other parts of the body, as the serum concentration for the hydrogel group was lower than that of the control group using the free form of the drug. One of the challenges facing hydrogels is during the implantation phase. Thermosensitive hydrogels remain in an aqueous form at room temperature for easy injection into a target site. Once at body temperature it assembles into a gel [63] . However this solution still runs the risk of clogging the needle or premature gelation in the syringe itself [60]. 2.6.3 Polymeric Films Polymeric films are another method of drug delivery implant s that have been explored for inclusion into soft ti ssues [55] . A common method for film creation is casting which involves the introduction of the liquid polymer to a mold and allowing it to cure. Depending on the mold, additional processing to alter the size and shape may be needed [66] . 12 Materials like silk, PLGA, PVA, and PCL have previously been successfully cast into films for drug delivery purposes [67- 70]. Electrospinning is another method of manufacturing polymer films through the creation of fibers by applying a voltage to a needle and grounding the system to a collecting plate [71] . The charge difference across the system helps to draw the polymer fibers from the polymer when it is deformed into a Taylor cone [72] . Electrospun mats can be created using a variety of polymers including silk, PLA, and PCL [73- 75]. The thread diameter and mat thickness can be controlled through several parameters including time, needle gauge, pumping rate, voltage, and distance between the needle and the collecting plate [76] . Applications for electrospun mats center on active wound healing and infection prevention through the incorporation of drugs [77] . Uses for mats as wound dressings could include application external to the body to assist in burn healing, or internally to the body as a way to assist healing followin g surgery [78] . In a PDN relief application the mat would need to be implanted to achieve the desired prolonged degradation characteristics. 2.6.4 Wafers The Gliadel Wafer is the only FDA approved current market solution for patients requiring brain cancer treatment [79] . The Gliadel Wafer has been used in over 20,000 procedures in the US since its launch in 1997 [80] . The wafer is deposited in a cavity of the brain following removal of the primary tumor [55] . Because implants are placed intra - cranially, the effective chemotherapeutic can directly target cancerous cells in the immediate surroundings without the challenges of navigating the blood- brain barrie r as with systemic chemotherapy options. A recent study by Boateng et al. created freeze dried wafers as drug 13 delivery devices for wound healing applications [81] . However, due to their physical characteristics, wafers are not able to be implanted via inj ection and must be placed surgically in the body, or through open wounds [55] . 2.6.5 Millirods Millirods are thin, preformed polymeric cylinders that can serve as extended drug release devices. This type of drug release solution is currently being used in the market for long term contraception. Progestin millirods are injected sub -dermally and can p rovide three years of contraception protection [82] . Current research is exploring millirod implants as a potential chemopreventive solution. In addition to an easy implantation method, millirods can be made using several different types of manufacturing m ethods including casting and melt extrusion [55]. At small scales, sacrificial encapsulation of the polymer in silastic tubing is a method of achieving millirods through melt extrusion [14] . For larger bulk scales a sacrificial manufacturing method is not the most efficient or cost effective route of implant creation. Casting, compression molding, or continuous extrusion using a fixed die would be manufacturing methods utilized at a larger scale. Millirods are excellent candidates for bulk manufacture as th e main point of customization would be at the point of implantation, allowing for the production of implants in bulk. 2.7 Effect of Geometry on Degradation Degradation of polymer implants tends to happen in one of two forms: surface or bulk erosion [83- 85]. Factors affecting the degradation and erosion of a polymer can include chemical interactions between polymer and drug, pH of the environment, or by the addition 14 of copolymers [83] . Understanding and modeling erosion behavior of drug delivery devices is complicated by the introduction of water to the polymer implant which may result in swelling and changes in pH [83] . Geometry has only recently gained traction as a way to alter functionality of a drug delivery implant [86] . Findings from a study by Burke rsroda et al. measured the degradation of cylindrical polymer matrices and found that polymers were able to undergo both types of degradation profiles depending on geometry and degradation parameters [84] . Klose et al. evaluated PLGA films and micropartic les and found that the geometry of the delivery devices to have a large impact on the release profiles for drugs [68] . The focus around geometry in drug delivery systems tends to center around the efficacy of vascular and endothelial carriers [87, 88] . These have typically taken the form of microspheres, but continued research in the kinetics and release properties of different geometry carriers has led to the creation of ellipsoids and disks [88 ]. Non- spherical delivery devices are thought to have an advantage as vascular delivery systems due to their high surface area to volume characteristics allowing for increased environment interactions and the potential to reach more diverse targets in the body [86] . However not much work has been done specifically on the impact of complex geometry on drug release rates for subcutaneous or intraperitoneally targeted millirod implants beyond changes in millirod diameter [14] . One of the few examples of long term implantable polymer drug delivery devices with complex geometries was a honeycomb structure created by Yang et al [89] . This study was done as a proof of concept for the microfabrication and drug release kinetics. However there was no in -depth discussion relating the surface area to the release rate. 15 Bansal et al. reported that with an increase in surface area there was an increase in observed drug release [14] . Through the evaluation of cylindrical implants at varying diameters it was also determined that the increased size of an implant also sees an increas e in the surface area of the implant resulting in increased drug diffusion into the environment surrounding the implant. Based on this knowledge, our study chose to compare millirod implants with similar cylindrical forms for easy implantation, but with dr astically different surface areas to determine the impact on drug release. 2.8 Summary of Literature Diabetic neuropathy is a fairly common adverse symptom stemming from sustained increased blood glucose levels resulting in pain in the legs and feet that can lead to amputation [2, 18] . Antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs are the current medications used to mitigate the pain of diabetic neuropathy, yet successful treatment under these therapies is only able to achieve a 50% reduction in patient pain [1, 26, 27] . There is a need for a natural, long term treatment for the reduction of painful diabetic neuropathy that utilizes a drug with lower risk of adverse side effects. Curcumin is one such drug that exhibits anti -inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti -hyperglycemic effects with no dose limiting toxicity at high dosages [39, 41, 44] . However encapsulation is required for curcumin to remain bioavailable in the body. By combining curcumin and PCL via cryomilling, the additional time and materials needed for s olvent evaporation mixing can be forgone in an effort to streamline the process of manufacturing for scale up. Previous millirod work determined that an increase in surface area saw an increased drug release rate [14] . 16 17 CHAPTER III: PRELIMINARY WORK Prior to investigating the main hypothesis of this thesis, unpublished research relating to drug delivery was explored. Two different types of drug delivery systems, electrospun mats and hydrogels, were initially pursued for applications in alternative che motherapy delivery and scaffolds for stimulating cell proliferation respectively. Techniques and learnings from these works helped in the development of the thesis research as outlined in Chapter 4. 3.1 Electrospinning of Silk The initial goal of this wor k was to develop a non -systemic chemotherapy drug delivery device for the treatment of local breast cancer recurrence. Investigation was focused on finding a method of drug delivery that was not utilized for chemotherapy solutions. Selection of materials w as based on high performing polymers with low in vivo toxicity. The manufacture of this delivery system also needed to be repeatable and scalable for ease of manufacturing purposes. Ultimately this project continued previous work from the iMED laboratory on the evaluation of electrospun polymer blends, including PCL and polyglycolide, for use as drug delivery systems [90, 91] . As mentioned previously in section 2.6.1, electrospinning is a method of creating micro or nano scale diameter polymer fibers by u tilizing an electric field. The experimental setup can be found in Figure 3.1. By applying a high voltage to a polymer loaded syringe needle and grounding the collecting plate, a large charge differential is created. A syringe pump slowly releases polymer from the syringe tip and the voltage 18 deforms the polymer bead creating a Taylor cone. This results in the release of fine diameter polymer fibers that are collected on the grounded plate. These polymer mats have a high surface area to volume ratio which is beneficial in drug release [75]. In contrast to previous iMED studies silk was selected as the main polymer component for electrospinning due to its beneficial properties as a biomaterial. Silk fibroin extracted from Bombyx mori cocoons have been found to have comparable degradation rates to other synthetic polymers, but with a reduced inflammatory response over PLA or collagen films [92] . Silk films have been used in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs like doxorubicin for in vivo breast cancer evaluation with positive results. The films showed a decrease in tumor weight and reduced metastatic spread, in addition to outperforming all other tested treatments [67] . Attempts to create silk electrospun mats were based on previous research methodologies [74, 93, 94] . Extraction of silk fibroin followed the protocol set forth by Rockwood et al [94] . Briefly, B. mori cocoons were opened and the silkworms were removed before being added to boiling water and sodium bicarbonate to degum the cocoons. After degu mming, the remaining silk fibroin was dissolved in lithium bromide and the resulting solution was added to a dialysis cassette. Following dialysis, the resulting fibroin solution was centrifuged. Parameters used for electrospinning the fibroin solution wer e as follows: Pump rate was 0.02 mL/minute, voltage was set to 15 kV, silk concentration was 8% by weight and was combined with a 5 mL of a 5% PEO solution dissolved in water, and distance from the collecting plate was 10 cm. After electrospinning, PEO was dissolved using 70% vol/vol ethanol and allowed to dry. Spun fibers prior to PEO removal can be seen in Figure 3.2. 19 Despite successfully electrospinning a small amount of silk fiber on one occasion it was determined that long term stora ge of fibroin via lyophilization was needed to continue pursuing this material option long term due to the process intensive requirements to prepare the silkworm cocoons for use. Freeze drying the dissolved fibroin concentrates it, but also makes it stable for extended periods of time at room temperature [94] . This is in contrast to the silk fibroin in the solution form, which must be chilled at 4 \u00b0C and runs the risk of gelling rendering it useless for an electrospinning solution. Figure 3.1: General electrospinning set up [95] . Figure 3.2 : SEM image of PEO/silk fibers prior to the removal of PEO . Ziabari (2009) 20 The ultimate design for this drug delivery system was a two stage drug delivery system. The electrospun silk fiber mat loaded with either a chemo therapeutic or anti - inflammatory drug would be spun first. A second polymer, like PLGA, loaded with a second drug would be spun directly on the silk mat. Testing would have determined the efficacy of the two different release profiles. 3.2 Hydrogels for Cell Growth A smaller project was done in collaboration with the Sakaguchi Lab at Iowa State University looking at the use of hydrogels as a medium to promote adult hippocampal stem cell proliferation. The main objective of the collaborative research was to have the hydrogel in a pipette tip used for cell culture. This was part of a larger experiment to create complex internal geometry in a cell proliferation scaffold to help guide the movement and growth of stem cells. Table 3.1 shows the materials and q uantities used for the hydrogels that were created. Briefly, using a calibrated pipette, each of the materials in Table 3.1 were added to a clean test tube in the order listed. The catalyst, TEMED, is the last to be added, and with its addition the ingredi ents react and start to foam. The foam was mixed using a scoopula for an additional minute and allowed to sit in a vacuum oven for 20 minutes before the addition of the dehydrating agent. Two methods of manufacture were attempted. The initial attempt trie d to mix the hydrogel directly in the pipette tip. The small end of a 1,000 L pipette tip was enclosed using Parafilm prior to introducing the chemicals to be mixed. In order to accommodate the smaller container size, the listed ingredient amounts were divided by five. Despite covering the exit hole of the pipette tip, very little hydrogel was formed in the space due to the high 21 levels of foaming following the addition of the TEMED catalyst. This resulted in very little residual hydrogel left behind in the pipette tip. Future attempts made the hydrogel external to the pipette tip. This was done by creating the hydrogel in a test tube as previously mentioned, but transferring it to an aluminum foil lined petri dish prior to the vacuum drying and dehydration steps. This resulted in a hydrogel disk that allowed for geometry modification of the hydrogel prior to inserting it in the pipette tip. This method also allowed for more direct control on the amount of hydrogel that could be added to the pipette tip. Following creation, hydrogel samples were sterilized using a 70% ethanol solution before entering the cell culture hood and allowed to dry overnight in the UV hood prior to cell culture [96] . A small sample of the hydrogel was introduced to test plates conta ining Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) and adult hippocampal stem cells were then added to the hydrogel via pipette. DMEM was selected to visually identify the pH changes of the cell medium during proliferation [97] . Evaluation of the culture after 24 hours determined that the hydrogel formulation was not compatible with cell culture as the environment was too basic for sustained cell growth due to the purple/blue color of the DMEM [98] .

Rivero ABSTRACT This study evaluated the impact of manufacturing process modifications aimed at the bulk manufacture of curcumin implants for diabetic ne uropathy pain relief. Poly(caprolactone) (PCL) and curcumin were blended using cryomilling as an alternative to the solvent mixing method which has higher manufacturing and time delay costs. X -ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the resulting mixture to determine the efficacy of cryomilling as an option for blending curcumin and PCL powders. By adopting compression molding as a manufacturing method we were able to create implant molds featuring threaded geometry on the millirod surface. Implants were subsequently evaluated in vitro for 30 days. Curcumin loade d millirod implants with a complex threaded surface geometry were found to have a higher , but not significant, percent mass loss after degradation and average daily curcumin release than the cylindrical implants. It can be conclude d that the utilization of cryomilling for the creation of curcumin loaded implants in bulk is an easier to manipulate and more cost effective method of combining PCL and curcumin without sacrificing implant effectiveness. 23 Keywords: implant, controlled dru g release, curcumin, surface geometry, bulk manufacture 4. 1 INTRODUCTION Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent form of diabetes in the United States affecting 9.3% of the total population [1] . This form of diabetes is more commonly associated with obesi ty or lack of physical activity resulting in reduced insulin production and sensitivity [2] . In addition, type 2 diabetics may also suffer from additional painful or debilitating conditions as a result of diabetes related complications. These can include b lindness, amputations, kidney problems, and neuropathy [1] . Of these adverse diabetic complications, 50% of diabetics experience neuropathy in some form, which often manifests in foot and leg pain [3, 4] . A particular form of this condition, painful diabet ic neuropathy (PDN), remains difficult to treat, as a 50% reduction in pain is considered a successful treatment [5] . Current solutions for PDN treatment include the use of cyclic antidepressants or antiepileptic drugs, both of which have negative side eff ects that may include dizziness, blurred vision, or weight gain [5] . Curcumin is a natural anti -inflammatory agent found naturally occurring in the spice turmeric. Many studies have been done to evaluate the impact of curcumin on various diseases including se veral different types of cancer, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes [6 -13]. Despite the positive effects curcumin exerts as an anti -inflammatory agent, it has been shown that curcumin has poor bioavailability when taken orally [14] . One option to overcome this challenge is through encapsulation of curcumin within a polymer matrix. This type of drug delivery is most notably used for effective birth control through subcutaneous implantation that provides protection for 3 years [15] . This type of solution is ideal for treatment applications that 24 require sustained treatment over a long period of time. As PDN is a chronic disease currently without a cure, an implantable drug delivery device would provide an alternative method of pain managem ent without jeopardizing patient quality of life. Previous literature has developed cylindrical millirods impregnated with curcu min as a potential chemopreven tive solution [7, 16- 18]. Implants were manufactured using the solvent mixing method to create a curcumin polymer matrix. PCL was selected as the polymer as it is a Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approved polymer for human clinical use due to its proven biocompatibility and low toxicity. After removal of the solvents overnight, the molten curcumi n and polymer was extruded through silastic tubing and cooled prior to removal from the tube. Based on the findings from Bansal et al. it was confirmed that an increase in implant surface area via changes in the diameter created an increase in drug release rate of curcumin [18] . With that knowledge, we wante d to test the effects of a drastic change in implant geometry on the degradation and drug release rate of curcumin. However, in or der to achieve this geometry an alternative method of manufacturing was needed. Through the use of a custom compression mold we developed a threaded cylindrical implant to compare against a traditional cylindrical implant. With the drastic increase in surface area it is expected that the threaded geometry implants will have an increased drug release rate. Additionally, it is expected that the manufacturing modifications will help in scaling up manufacture of implants without compromising quality. 25 4.2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 4.2.1 Materials Poly ( caprolactone) 50,000 molecular weight was purchased from (Capa 6506, Perstorp, Sweden). Phosphate -buffered saline powder (pH 7.4) and bovine calf serum (BCS) were purchased from Sigma -Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Additional BCS was purchased from Hyclone (Logan, UT, USA). Curcumin (98% pure) was purchased from Acros Organics (Morris Plains, NJ, USA). No further analysis was done on any of the received materials. 4.2.2 Cryomilling PCL was combined with curcumin at a 15% w/w ratio. Milling was done using a SPEX Sample Prep Freezer Mill 6 770 (Metuchen, NJ, USA). PCL and curcumin were combined in a grinding vial and placed in the grinding chamber. The vial was precooled for 15 minutes prior to the start of grinding cycles. The mill was programmed for 5 cycles, a 2 minute cool time, and a 3 minute run time at a rate of 10 cps. 4.2.3 XRD Evaluation of Cryomilled PCL and Curcumin In order to determine if the cryomilling process generated a homogeneous mixture of PCL and curcumin, XRD analysis was done over a full angle spectrum in a Rigaku Miniflex 600 XRD analysis unit (Tokyo, Japan). The voltage and current X -ray generator applied were 40 kV and 15 mA respectively. A scintillation counter (SC -70) was used as the detector. Scan range was from 1.01 to 60 degrees at a step width of 0.02 degre es. The XRD profiles were analyzed using the integrated X -ray powder diffraction s oftware, PDXL, version 2.1.3.4. 26 4.2.4 Compression Molding Implants were created using two custom molds. The cylindrical rod mold created implants with a 2 mm diameter, while the threaded rod mold had an implant diameter of 1.5 mm in order to accommodate machining capabilities for the introduction of threads. Molds were loaded into a model 4386 model Carver hydraulic press (Wabash, IN, USA). Blank PCL implants were created u sing 50,000 molecular weight PCL at a plate temperature of 71\u00b0 C. Curcumin loaded PCL implants were created using the cryomilled PCL and curcumin at a plate temperature of 71\u00b0C and compressed with 1,200 psi . Implants were removed from the molds and separated from the mold stem before evaluation. Implants for both geometries were cut to a length of 1.30 cm. The average threaded implant mass was 22.0 \u00b1 0.75 mg and the average cylindrical implant was 49.9 \u00b1 1.04 mg. 4.2.5 In Vitro Evaluation Implants w ere studied in vitro by submerging each sample (n=3 for each condition, 12 total implants) in 10 mL of PBS solution (pH 7.4) in 20 mL amber vials. In order to better mimic the in vivo environment, the PBS was supplemented with BCS (10% v/v). The sample implants were incubated at 37\u00b0 C and agitated at 150 rpm on a shaker table (I24 New Brunswick Incubator Shaker, Eppendorf, Germany). Samples were measured at every media change every 48 hours. 4.2.6 Spectrophotometer Characterization In order to validate curcumin w as present in degradation media , 1 mL of ethanol was added to media to solubilize residual curcumin. Media from curcumin samples was collected 27 every 2 days, n=3. Absorbance of the media was measured spectrophotometrically (DU 720, Beckman Coulte r, CA, USA) at 430 nm as previously established [19] . A standard curve was used to determine the quantitative relationship between absorbance values and curcumin concentration pre sent in the degradation media. Curcumin concentration range was from 100 g - 700 g . 4.2.7 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Evaluation of surface area features and the effects of degradation on physical properties of implants was studied using a Jeol JCM -6000 benchtop SEM (Tokyo, Japan). Implants were evaluated prior to in vitr o degradation and after 30 days of degradation. Samples were mounted using carbon tape and analyzed at 15 kV. 4.2.8 Statistical Analysis Percent mass loss values were analyzed using a two way ANOVA with significance set at p < 0.05. ANOVA factors were de fined as geometry and curcumin loading. Percent mass loss values were averaged over the 30 day period for a sample size of n=3. Statistical significance for average daily drug release was determined using a standard two tailed t -test. Differences were considered significant for values where p < 0.05. Normal distribution and equal variances were assumed . 28 4.3 RESULTS 4.3.1 XRD Evaluation of Cryomilled PCL and Curcumin Figure 4.1 the XRD profile for the cryomilled PCL and curcumin at an 85% to 15% Comparison peaks for 100% curcumin and 100% PCL are also shown in Figure 4.1. This result shows that PCL and curcumin mixture has a distinct profile curve unique from its constituent parts. Figure 4.2 shows the XRD analysis of a solvent mixed matrix of PCL and curcumin in the same 85- 15% ratio. There was a noticeable difference at the 10 degree point in the XRD characteristic peaks of the cryomilled curcumin and PCL powder in comparison to the solvent mixed PC L and curcumin solid dispersion. The first large characteristic peak for curcumin is found at the 10 degree point, and a reduced version of that peak can be found on the cryomilled XRD profile, but not the solvent mixed profile. 4.3.2 In Vitro Results In vitro release profiles for both the original cylindrical geometry and the new threaded geometry implants without drug loading can be found in Figure 4.3. Due to drastically different geometries, the starting masses for the threaded and cylindrical implants were not directly comparable by mass loss. Instead, percent mass loss was used to analyze changes in implant weight. There was no significant difference in the average percent weight loss over 30 days of degradation between the two geometries without curcumin loading. 29 Figure 4.1: XRD profiles of PCL 15% comparison to solvent mixed PCL and curcumin in the same ratio. 30 Figure 4.3: Graph of percent mass loss findings across all groups. The percent mass loss of curcumin loaded PCL cylindrical millirods (1.59 \u00b1 0.884) was not significantly different from that of the blank PCL rod mass loss (0.813 \u00b1 0.399). Similarly, 1.31) did not have a signi ficantly higher average percent mass loss over the PCL only sample. Lastly, a comparison of average cumulative mass loss for curcumin loaded implants with threaded and cylindrical geometries shows that t he curcumin loaded thre aded geometry (3.39 \u00b1 1.31) did not have a significantly higher percent mass loss over 30 days than the cylindrical geometry implant with curcumin (1.59 \u00b1 0.884). Table 4.1 shows the ANOVA results for the percent mass loss data. No interactions were found to be significant at a sampl e size of three. Figure 4.4 shows sample daily percent mass loss trends for the two curcumin loaded implants with different geometries. Table 4.1 ANOVA of Cumulative Mass Loss Percentages (n=3) 31 Figure 4.4 : In vitro release profiles over 30 days of degradation by percent mass loss of 15% curcumin loaded implants between the two different geometry types. There are no significant differences between treatments. 4.3.3 Spectrophotometry Characterization The results of the spectrophotometry characterization can be found in Figure 4.5. Curcumin concentration was analyzed every 2 days and those values were averaged to determine the average daily release rate over the period of 30 days. Using the standard cur ve to relate absorbance values to g/day release found that the threaded geometry implant had a significantly higher average daily release than the cylindrical geometry after accounting for mass differences. Threaded geometry implants released an average of 47.98 \u00b1 g/day. 32 Figure 4.5 : Average daily curcumin release values over the course of 30 days in vitro degradation. * de notes statistical significance. 4.3.4 SEM Analysis Scanning electron microscope analysis of both cylindrical and threaded millirods can be found in Figure 4.6. After in vitro degradation a noticeable change in surface morphology was observed in both geometry types. At 30 days of degradati on the cylindrical implant began showing signs of small surface holes where there were none previously. Estimated threaded implant surface area was calculated usi ng the following equation [20]: = 22 22 22 3 Where a is the inner thread dia meter, b is the outer thread diameter, c is the pitch length, and d is the length of the implant. Surface area for the threaded geometry implant was found to be 72.4 mm2. 33 Figure 4.6 : SEM images for sample millirods before and after in vitro degradation.

However, this method requires additional materials in the form of solvents to dissolve the drug and the polymer, as well as time to remove the solvent from the mixture after the drug and polymer were combined. This is usually done overnight in a vacuum environment. The end product is a solid curcumin and polymer mass that must undergo additional processing prior to A B C D 34 being converted into its final form. Removing solvents from the polymer matrix creation would reduce manufacturing material costs in addition to a reduction in material processing time. Cryomilling can be execute d in minutes rather than hours, and the end product is a powder that is easy to introduce into molding or extruding applications. A comparison of the XRD profiles for both solvent mixed and cryomilled PCL and curcumin shows similar overall trends. Peaks indicate diffraction intensity at different angles. These peaks are unique to crystals within a structure and can be used to identify differences in materials present in the sample [21]. Despite maintaining relatively similar peak trends, n ear the 10 degree mark the cryomilled mixture has a defined peak not present in the solvent mixed sample. This peak is a reduced intensity version of the curcumin characteristic peak that appears at the same degree. This retention of a main characteristic peak for curcumin may point to a better method of mixing without compromising the compound integrity. A study by Wegiel et al. utilized cryomilling as a method to create larger quantities of amorphous curcumin and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) mixtures [22 ]. From this we can conclude that cryomilling serves as an effective alternative method for creating a homogeneous powder polymer matrix in bulk manufacturing quantities. Additionally, the use of silastic tubing works well for small scale production of implants with a basic c ylindrical geometry. Based on previous literature , modification of surface area is a way to increase drug release rate, but use of tubing limits changes to modifying diameter size and production volume. The use of a mold would allow for production of 8- 12 implants at a time in addition to the potential incorporation of new surface geometries with a reduced amount of materials consumed during the process. Both the cylindrical and threaded geometry implants for this study were created through the use of a mol d. This allowed for minimal post manufacturing 35 processing while allowing for the addition of complex surface geometry to the threaded implants that was previously not attainable. In vitro degradation of the cylindrical geometry in comparison to the thread ed geometry without drug loading was not statistically significant. By comparing each drug loaded implant geometry type to its respective blank implant counterpart it was determined that increased surface geometry in combination with curcumin loadi ng was not signif icant for percent mass loss degradation. Both the curcumin loaded cylindrical implant and the curcumin loaded threaded implant showed greater percent mass loss degradation than the blank PCL implants , however, due to the small sample size statistical significance was not obtained. A comparison of the curcumin loaded cylindrical implant and the curcumin loaded threaded implant showed the threaded geometry had a 46.9% greater percent mass loss over the cylindrical geometry during degradation. Howe ver, an analysis of variance was run on the average percent mass loss values and showed no significant values at p < 0.05 indicating that a larger sample size is required to confirm that drug loading is a statistically significant parameter. Analysis of th e percent mass loss from Figure 6 indicates a steady decreasing trend over the 30 day period. No burst release kinetics were observed for either implant geometry. SEM analysis of the threaded implants before and after degradation show that the threaded sur face geometry was still present and visible after 30 days of degradation. Surface area for the threaded geometry implant was 72.4 mm 2, which is a 9.3% increase in surface area over a cylindrical implant of the same diameter. Spectrophotometer analysis of the degradation serum showed after accounting for differences in implant masses that the threaded geometry implants had a higher average g/day release than the cylindrical geometry. This confirms the hypothesis that an increase in surface 36 geometry would increase the drug release rate. A 100 mg cylindrical implant with a diameter of 3.22 mm and a 20% drug load created by Gupta et al. had an average daily release of 98 \u00b5g/day and a cumulative release of 9.8% in 20 days [17] . Implants created for this study were not directly comparable to the previous findings due to differences in weight, volume, and drug load. However, extrapolation of mass and drug loading of the cylindrical geometry to better match the previous study gave an average daily release of ~70 g/day. Differences in implant length and diameter would create significant differences in implant volume from the comparison implant and may account for discrepancies in average daily release between the two studies. By using bulk manufacture of implants a cost savings could be imparted on the consumer. However, bulk manufacture limits the amount of customization available for the patient at the point of manufacture. Rather, customization for an individual patient would happen at the point of implantation. Customization could include the number of implants needed, the site of implantation, or post manufacturing modification, such as a change in implant length, to better meet patient dosing needs to manage neuropathy pain. The implant would be best utilized as an adjunct treatment to tricyclic antidepressants and antiepileptic drugs, or as a standalone pain relief option for patients intolerant or unaffected by current drug therapies. 4.5 CONCLUSION There is a current need for additional treatment solutions to help manage the symptoms of PDN without the negative side effects of the current off label prescribed drugs. Curcumin presents an attractive anti -inflammatory agent and glycemic regulator, but is plagued by low bioavailability when taken orall y. By altering the shape geometry through the introduction of threads, an increase in percent mass loss , although not statistically significant at this sample size, 37 was observed for curcumin loaded implants. The threaded geometry implants also showed a higher g/day release of curcumin in vitro than their cylindrical counterparts. By modifying previously used manufacturing methods, this threaded geometry feature for subcutaneous implants can be easily scaled up for larger manufact uring needs.

Current medications in use for treatment do not fully relieve pain and can adversely affect quality of life for those who suffer from PDN. There is a need for the creation of alternative pain relief therapies specifically targeting the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy. Effective strate gies to control PDN have been to target hyperglycemia overall or block inflammatory and oxidative signals in cells. Curcumin is a natural compound found in the spice turmeric that has been shown to have anti -hyperglycemic, anti -inflammatory, and antioxidan t effects in cells. Curcumin has been successfully used for in vivo evaluation studies focused on the compound's effectiveness against diabetes. However when taken orally, curcumin has limited bioavailability as the digestive system metabolizes most of the active compounds. In order to increase the effectiveness of the compound, curcumin needs to be encapsulated. The focus of this research was to determine if changes to the manufacturing process for encapsulating curcumin in a polymer matrix would be viable options in a bulk manufacturing setting. Two primary manufacturing improvements to the creation of curcumin loaded millirod implants were established. The first is the use of cryomilling as a mixing method for the creation of homogeneous PCL and curcumin blends. The second was the incorporation of compression molding to allow for more complex surface geometry inclusions in an implant. These geometry inclusions were found to increase the percent mass loss of the implant in addition to increasing the average daily drug release over a standard cylind rical implant. 41 5.2 Review of Contribution By utilizing cryomilling as a method of mixing curcumin and PCL compounds, the ease of manufacture of millirod implants in a scaled up manufacturing setting is greatly improved over solvent mixing methods. Introduction of compression molding as the main manufacturing process allows for previously unattainable implant surface geometries tha t impact implant degradation rate in addition to reducing the amount of materials consumed over the silastic tubing extrusion method. These modifications to the manufacture process are an essential step in moving curcumin implants from benchtop to market. 5.3 Future Work Future studies will look at the impact of increased cryomilling time, and therefore smaller particle size, on average daily release of curcumin and percent mass loss implants. Evaluation of storage capabilities also needs to be done to determine the number of days before a PCL and curcumin matrix becomes crystalline. Crystallinity in curcumin is not ideal as amorphous solid dispersions are more soluble but less stable [54] . This study would be similar to the crystalline stability studies done by Wegiel, et al. [54] . The effective shelf life of the amorphous cryomilled powder would be crucial when considering a bulk manufacturing timeline in addition to the movement of finished implants through the supply chain. Another area of future work will include effect ive implant locations in vivo .42 REFERENCES [1] M. M. Huizinga and A.
