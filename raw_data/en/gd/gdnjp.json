It is a blend of many modalities including energy healing, intuitive mind-body reading, somatic therapy, reiki, somato-emotional release, chakra balancing, parts work, attachment work, and intuitive guidance from Spirit. Together, we bring healing to the energy body, mind-body, nervous system and the whole of you. We will be giving parts that need help exactly what they need and also giving those parts the tools they need to heal permanently. What's most important to me in these sessions is that you to feel deeply seen, loved & understood. Love heals! This session is a co-creative process of getting to the root of painful patterns and beginning their transformation process so that you can be your most whole, happy, connected version of yourself:) The session might feel like you are getting energy work, somato-emotional therapy & intuitive reading all in one session! I recommend reading more about what you'll experience at the bottom of this page. 90 mins | $180 Women's Ayurvedic Abhyanga This treatment is totally different than the Somadi sessions! This silent, light-pressure, rhythmic Ayurvedic massage will put you in a balanced, peaceful state of bliss. In this treatment, I use lots of warm, rich oil infused with grounding and cleansing herbs. The massage is light, rhythmic and choreographed and does not address specific areas of tension. It is designed to put you in a peaceful and meditative brain-wave state. We begin each session with a 10-min vigorous scrub and then move into the massage. People usually feel blissed-out and nourished afterward. This treatment is dear to my heart because I had the honor of learning it in a 1:1 mentorship program at a famous Panchakarma clinic. My mentor taught me that when we practice Abhyanga, our intention is to anoint people as though they were sacred. **Please be aware that these treatments are traditionally performed topless in order to work with the lymph around the breasts. Please wear clothing that you might be able to get oil on. Your hair and skin will be full of this delicious, grounding after the treatment. This is luxurious! 75 mins | $150 Psychedelic Guidance & Integration There has been so much research on the deep power of psychedelic medicines that the state of Colorado has decriminalized ketamine and psilocybin in order to aid in the healing of trauma, PTSD, depression and anxiety. These experiences are also a gateway to new levels of spiritual experiences that can be quite profound. They have been found to facilitate deep insights and realizations that aid people on their paths in life, reconnecting them to their purpose. In these sessions you can receive support and guidance for your medicine journey as well as help integrating your experience. Journeys are oftentimes epic for both healing and expanding but integrating the experience into daily life is where the real power is! Please contact me for any questions as offerings can vary greatly. "}
