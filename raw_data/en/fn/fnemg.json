That's where the book title came from. When most people hear the question, 'how did I get here?,' they think about being lost, not knowing where they are. When I say here, it's a spiritual place. It's not a question of being lost, but a question of being found.\" said Walker, who is also a minister. Walker's 151-page book empowers readers to seek God actively through the most difficult of situations, trusting He is able to make a way, even when it seems heavy and like there is no hope. \"I want people to walk away after reading my book healed, specifically in the area of emotions because the majority of the book is about learning to manage your expectations. I want the reader to be exposed to who they want to be.\" Walker noted that there are five chapters devoted to discussing getting healed within yourself, your marriage or relationships, within your family, or with God. \"I was surprised how emotional I got when writing the book... I took a break after writing a particular chapter .... because I wrote about things that I haven't verbally said out loud for years or things that I have never said to anyone ever,\" she added. \"You see, I'm a daughter of domestic violence.... and I had to learn how to manage my expectations of men and people in general based on some of the encounters I had.\" As a certified marriage mentor, life coach, homemaker and the owner of EboniWalker, LLC, Walker has helped many people who struggle with procrastination, fear of failure and lack of confidence. \"Hopefully, my book gives readers a fresh hope for the future, to get to a beautiful place in their lives,\" she said. \"Your best days are ahead of you, not behind you. It may not always seem like it, look like it, or feel like it\u2014but it's true. I hope people see God when they read my book.\" Walker noted that the publisher for the book is also an ASU graduate, Dr. Jenny Thelwell, who is the author of \"Pressure Point.\" \"Her publishing company is Revolutionary Diamond. It's a Hornet helping out a Hornet,\" she added. To purchase the book, go to [https://eboniwalker.com](https://eboniwalker.com/). It is expected to be available on Amazon soon.
