It is widely used in Ayurvedic medicine. The plant is promoted as an immunomodulator, including alkaloids, steroids, flavonoids, phenolics, nitrogen-containing compounds, and trace elements. But how much of the hype is supported by evidence? Unsurprisingly, there is a shortage of good clinical trials. Yet, during the last few years, a surprising number of reviews of the accumulating evidence have emerged: [One review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32240781/)suggested that pre-clinical, as well as clinical studies, suggest the effectiveness of Withania somnifera (L.) against neurodegenerative disease. - A further [review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31975514/)suggested a potential role of W. somnifera in managing diabetes. - A [systematic review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31742775/)of 5 clinical trials found that W. somnifera extract improved performance on cognitive tasks, executive function, attention, and reaction time. It also appears to be well tolerated, with good adherence and minimal side effects. - Another [systematic review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30466985/)included 4 clinical trials and reported significant improvements in serum hormonal profile, oxidative biomarkers, and antioxidant vitamins in seminal plasma. No adverse effects were reported in infertile men taking W. somnifera treatment. - Another [review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32201301/)concluded that the root of the Ayurvedic drug W. somnifera (Aswagandha) appears to be a promising safe and effective traditional medicine for management of schizophrenia, chronic stress, insomnia, anxiety, memory/cognitive enhancement, obsessive-compulsive disorder, rheumatoid arthritis, type-2 diabetes and male infertility, and bears fertility promotion activity in females adaptogenic, growth promoter activity in children and as adjuvant for reduction of fatigue and improvement in quality of life among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. - A [systematic review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33670194/)of 13 RCTs found that Ashwagandha supplementation was more efficacious than placebo for improving variables related to physical performance in healthy men and women. - Another [systematic review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32316411/)concluded that Ashwagandha supplementation might improve the VO2max in athletes and non-athletes. Impressed? This certainly looks as though that this plant is worthy of further study. But I can never help feeling a bit skeptical when I hear of such a multitude of benefits without evidence for adverse effects (other than minor upset stomach, nausea, "}
