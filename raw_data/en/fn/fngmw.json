Muscle pain and tenderness, along with feeling tired all the time and having mood issues? Widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue or feeling exhausted may be a sign you have fibromyalgia. Alternative medicine methods like Acupuncture and TCM offer a way to help ease the [chronic pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3658605/), [sleep problems](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-sleep-better-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and emotional disturbances caused by [fibromyalgia](https://fibroandpain.org/fibromyalgia/what-is-fibromyalgia). Fibromyalgia (sometimes referred to as \"fibro\" or FM) is one of the [most common](https://fmaware.net/fibromyalgia-prevalence/) chronic pain conditions worldwide, affecting an estimated 10 million people in the United States alone. Still, this chronic condition is still not well understood by medical science. There are no definitive tests to show whether or not fibromyalgia is the cause of pain all over the body along with chronic fatigue, so many people go on having musculoskeletal problems and hurting all over without being diagnosed or treated. There are many people who have fibromyalgia who also suffer from [depression](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-depression-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) related to the illness. [Fibromyalgia](https://www.healthline.com/health/fibromyalgia) can dramatically impact a person's quality of life. While people of ages and genders can have fibromyalgia, it is much more prevalent among women. Fibromyalgia is considered to be a syndrome: a collection of symptoms that often occur together. Fibromyalgia is associated with other conditions like [lupus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-lupus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [rheumatoid arthritis (RA)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-rheumatoid-arthritis-ra-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic [fatigue](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-fatigue-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) syndrome (ME/CFS). It may coexist with these other chronic conditions, or sometimes be mistaken for one of them. However, fibromyalgia is now understood by medical professionals to be its own distinct condition with specific manifestations. People who have [RA have been shown](http://blog.arthritis.org/rheumatoid-arthritis/rheumatoid-arthritis-side-of-fibromyalgia/) to have an increased risk for also having fibromyalgia. But the quality and location of the musculoskeletal pain differentiates the two conditions. The pain of fibromyalgia shows up in the musculoskeletal system in the areas where there are large muscles, causing pain that may move around throughout the torso, [back, hips, thighs](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hip-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and arms. Fibromyalgia pain is often described as a kind of \"tenderness,\" or when the body aches all over. \"Tender points\" all over the body are specific to fibromyalgia. This is [different from arthritis](https://www.arthritis.org/diseases/fibromyalgia?_ga=2.91328922.1871329779.1619451838-775333886.1619451838), which generally causes swelling and pain in the joints. Both RA and [lupus](https://www.hss.edu/conditions_Lupus-and-Fibromyalgia.asp) are understood to be caused by inflammation, while fibromyalgia is believed to be caused by a problem with the central nervous system (CNS), in which pain signals are amplified, causing extreme sensitivity and pain, even when there is no seeming reason for that area of the body to feel pain. Some of the fibromyalgia symptoms are very similar to those of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), which is also known as chronic fatigue (CFS). As with RA and lupus, the two conditions can overlap. The difference is that the overwhelming symptoms of ME/CFS are related to fatigue or post-exertional malaise (PEM), while the predominant symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread muscle pain and tenderness. Fibromyalgia seems to show up in some people due to a traumatic or triggering event. There can then be a fibromyalgia flare up due to the presence of other triggers later. Fortunately, acupuncture, herbs, and other forms of alternative medicine that fall under TCM can approach all of the different symptoms of fibromyalgia holistically. Acupuncture is widely accepted to be effective for helping musculoskeletal conditions of all kinds, as well as neurological problems, rheumatological conditions, sleep issues, and emotional and mental health disorders. Top 10 Symptoms of Musculoskeletal Pain As a syndrome, fibromyalgia may manifest as any combination of a few or several of a variety of symptoms. The most common symptoms of [fibromyalgia](https://www.cdc.gov/arthritis/basics/fibromyalgia.htm) include: - Widespread musculoskeletal pain: pain, tenderness, and/or stiffness in the muscles all over the body that may come and go or migrate from one area to another - Fatigue, exhaustion, extreme tiredness - Emotional and/or mental issues: depression, anxiety, PTSD - Sleep problems, hands and/or feet [TMJ,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)jaw pain - Digestive problems: [irritable [bloating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-bloated-stomach-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Bladder pain, interstitial cystitis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-uti-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) Other more subtle signs of fibromyalgia can include: [ itching](https://www.prohealth.com/library/fibromyalgia-itching-causes-make-stop-91719) all over, a skin crawling sensation (like bugs crawling on skin), extra sensitivity to smells or temperature, a tendency to shiver, or dry eyes or eye pain. Top 5 Causes Musculoskeletal Pain Flares The [symptoms of fibromyalgia](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fibromyalgia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354780) tend to come and go. Some days a person might feel almost totally fine, then other days, the fibromyalgia flares, causing more pain, exhaustion, and sometimes other symptoms. What triggers a fibromyalgia flare up? - Hormonal changes during menstrual cycle, [miscarriage](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-prevent-miscarriage-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), pregnancy, or postpartum - Prolonged [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) - A sudden [traumatic event, PTSD](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ptsd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/)trigger, [panic attack](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-panic-attacks-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) - Changes in weather: temperature, humidity, barometric pressure - Lack of sleep When one of the 18 tender points of fibromyalgia is touched, it can trigger more widespread pain. These points include areas like: the front and sides of the neck, the base of the skull, the elbow, and the backs of the knees. What Is the Treatment for Fibromyalgia? Medical [treatment for fibromyalgia](https://fmaware.net/fibromyalgia-treatment/) typically involves a combination of medicine to alleviate pain with psychological support and lifestyle management. [Drugs](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/living-fibromyalgia-drugs-approved-manage-pain) like Lyrica, Cymbalta, and Savella are approved for prescription for patients with fibromyalgia. Lyrica and Cymbalta are also used to treat conditions that involve nerve damage or nerve pain, like [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), neuropathy, [shingles](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shingles-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), while Savella works in a way that is similar to antidepressants. Other [pain relievers](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-help-dependence-on-hydrocodone-and-other-opioid-pain-medication-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and/or antidepressant medications may also be prescribed to help people manage pain of fibromyalgia, help them sleep better, and boost mood. All of these medications can come with unwanted side effects, and they do not help to relieve pain in every case. People with FM pain will often receive counseling on how to manage their condition by being very careful not to exert themselves or become exhausted. Getting quality sleep and reducing stress can help to prevent fibro flare up. It can be hard for people to follow guidelines that ask them to make major lifestyle changes. Fortunately, acupuncture, herbs, and the patient support of a TCM practitioner can offer more help for people with fibromyalgia. Acupuncture for Musculoskeletal Pain Can acupuncture help fibromyalgia? Yes. TCM offers a comprehensive system for managing musculoskeletal pain and chronic pain, helping to heal nerve damage and restore central nervous system function, supporting mental health, relieving anxiety and depression, and addressing sleep problems. Whereas with conventional medicine, a patient might go from one doctor to another to handle all of these issues, the acupuncturist can address them all at once. The TCM point of view always takes into consideration the connection between what is going on physically with what is going on emotionally in each individual, so it is really an excellent way to help patients with fibromyalgia. Like Western medicine, TCM recognizes that sometimes fibromyalgia can be originally caused by a traumatic event or an extremely stressful time in one's life. Emotional upheavals cause stress to the liver, which in turn causes stagnation of blood and Qi. TCM also sees coldness and dampness as pathogenic forces that can have a profound effect on overall health. According to TCM, widespread musculoskeletal pain falls under the category of Bi Syndrome. In Bi Syndromes, cold and damp get into the body and take hold on a deep level, causing pain and stiffness. With [acupuncture treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4223771/) for fibromyalgia, we seek to clear cold and damp, and restore good flow of Qi and blood throughout the body. Acupuncture has an analgesic effect, relieving muscle pain without side effects. Moxibustion may be utilized to bring warmth to areas of the body. Cupping is another modality used to draw out damp cold and improve blood flow. Tai Qi and Qi Gong, gentle therapeutic movement practices that have been developed over 1000s of years as part of TCM, also may offer great benefits for people with FM. A [systematic review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6365227/) of over 400 studies of fibromyalgia treatment with TCM, acupuncture treatment was found to be effective for reducing both short term pain and long term pain. Another [review](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3110829/) found that acupuncture and herbs worked better to reduce pain than standard medication therapy. Top 5 Tips for Managing Fibromyalgia Dealing with fibromyalgia and seeing significant improvement in fibro pain will probably involve making some lasting lifestyle changes. Making adjustments to your sleep habits, food choices, and your exercise routine can make a difference in preventing the next FM flare up. - Choose a gentle, enjoyable form of exercise. Start slowly, and gradually increase the amount you can exercise over time. Walking outdoors is a great option, as are Tai Qi and Qi Gong. - Limit or eliminate caffeine and alcohol. These substances can interfere with getting good sleep and exacerbate liver problems. Alcohol is not safe to consume if you are taking medications for fibromyalgia like Lyrica, Cymbalta, and Savella. - Avoid sugar, which may give you a short-lived good feeling, but will lead to a \"sugar crash,\" and feeling more exhausted than before. Any kind of simple carbohydrates, like foods made of white flour, or bottled fruit juices, can cause highs and lows in blood sugar. Avoid sugar substitutes and food additives like MSG, which can trigger reactions in some people. - Focus on eating complex carbohydrates, especially vegetables. These help you have a more sustained energy throughout the day. Nuts and seeds are also good. - Warm baths with Epsom salts can be very soothing. Getting enough sleep at night, and even resting or napping during the day, may be essential to your well-being if you have fibromyalgia. Develop habits that allow for plenty of rest and set yourself up for a good night's sleep. Acupuncture Near Me for Musculoskeletal Pain Many people who have fibromyalgia choose to try alternative medicine as a way of managing FM pain. Physiological conditions that stem from emotional stress are often not resolved through the use of medications. Acupuncture and TCM have a long history of helping people to heal from emotional disturbances that cause physical pain. Acupuncture treatment works to increase the flow of energy through the body and improve the connections between the brain and nerve endings. If you or someone you know suffers with fibro, consider acupuncture as a way to find relief from musculoskeletal pain and constant fatigue. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How To Treat Dizziness With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) By Qineng Feeling light-headed and dizzy? Maybe you feel like your head is spinning, or that the world is spinning around you? Headache, nausea, [dizziness](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dizziness/symptoms-causes/syc-20371787), and vertigo are symptoms that can be caused by a variety of health problems. [Acupuncture and TCM offer](https://www.acufinder.com/Acupuncture+Information/Detail/Acupuncture+for+Vertigo) vertigo treatment that can help relieve that sense of dizziness and nausea, or feeling light-headed and tired all the time. Feeling dizzy is one the [most common](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/6422-dizziness) reasons that people go in for a doctor's visit, or even visit the emergency room. Dizziness is a fairly general term that can mean anything from feeling light-headed, woozy, faint, off-balance, or unsteady to feeling nauseated or like you're about to pass out. Vertigo is a specific type of dizziness that refers to a sensation of spinning, as if the room around you is moving. You might feel like you're leaning to one side, or about to fall over. It can make you feel sick to your stomach, similar to motion sickness. In popular culture, the word \"vertigo\" is sometimes used to mean a \"fear of heights,\" but that is actually called \"acrophobia.\" The sensation of vertigo can be triggered by looking down from above, or looking up at something very tall, but this is not the cause of most episodes of vertigo. Vertigo causes include migraines and problems with the inner ear. The inner ear and eyes both relay information to the brain about a person's spatial relation to the environment, so when the functioning of the eyes or ears is disrupted, it can cause a sense of imbalance, and even nausea. [Migraine headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), particularly a specific type called a [vestibular migraine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/vestibular-migraine), can cause pressure in the head and dizziness and nausea. [Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vertigo/symptoms-causes/syc-20370055) (BPPV) is one type of vertigo that causes short-term bouts of sudden dizziness. Benign positional [vertigo](https://www.ucsfhealth.org/conditions/vertigo) is caused by the shifting of calcium crystals (canaliths) in the inner ear. This can happen due to a head injury or simply aging. Other inner ear problems that can cause signs of vertigo include Meniere's disease and Labyrinthitis. [Meniere's disease](https://vestibular.org/article/diagnosis-treatment/types-of-vestibular-disorders/menieres-disease/) is a chronic disorder related to abnormal amounts of fluid (endolymph) collecting in the inner ear. The exact cause of Meniere's is unknown, but it develops more frequently later in life. [ Meniere's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menieres-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) causes attacks of vertigo that can last from a few hours up to 24 hours. Like migraines with an aura, there is often a period of time during which a set of \"warning symptoms\" begin to occur, such as: a feeling of uneasiness, being off-balance, headache and dizziness, queasiness, hearing loss or ringing in the ears, or extra sensitivity to sound. Once an attack of vertigo hits, it can be quite severe, causing intense pressure in the ear, blurred vision, vomiting or diarrhea, cold sweats, [rapid heart rate](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and feelings of fear and panic. There is currently no cure for Meniere's. [Labyrinthitis](https://www.cedars-sinai.org/health-library/diseases-and-conditions/l/labyrinthitis.html) refers to inflammation of the small parts of the inner ear, or around the nerves of the inner ear that can be caused by viral or bacterial infections, such as: a flu, measles, herpes, hepatitis, [Epstein-Barr](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-mononucleosis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), chicken pox, or childhood ear infections. Symptoms of labyrinthitis can include: dizziness, nausea, [tinnitus (ringing in the ears)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/), and [difficulty concentrating](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-adhd-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Lightheadedness is a similar sensation to [dizziness](https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/dizzi) in some ways, but is usually caused by a sudden change in [blood pressure](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-high-blood-pressure-with-acupuncture-tcm/) or the flow of blood to the head. You have probably experienced feeling light headed and dizzy when you get up too fast from sitting or lying down. Other causes of lightheadedness include: allergies, anxiety, [anemia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anemia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), hyperventilating, [arrhythmia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-irregular-heartbeat-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), or [heavy bleeding (as during menstruation)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-leiomyoma-of-the-uterus-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). Dizzy spells happen to everyone once in a while. But recurrent [headache](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) and dizziness should be addressed. Acupuncture and TCM have been used to help dizziness for thousands of years and offer natural solutions to the underlying causes of vertigo. Top 10 Causes of Dizziness Feeling light headed and dizzy, or having headache, nausea, dizziness, can occur as symptoms of a variety of imbalances. Reasons for dizziness may include: - Inner ear imbalance, or labyrinthitis - apnea, snoring](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-stop-snoring-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) migraine - Dehydration - alcohol, diuretics - Sinus issues - Ear infection - Low Blood Sugar - [diabetes](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-diabetes-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), hypoglycemia - Multiple Sclerosis (MS) - Prescription Medication side effects Dizzy spells that occur first thing in the [morning](https://www.healthline.com/health/waking-up-dizzy-causes#causes) are common for some people. This can be simply due to the change in pressure in the ear when you get out of bed. Waking up dizzy due to sleep apnea occurs because this condition obstructs your breathing during the night, and you may have lower oxygen levels when you wake up. Being dehydrated is another common cause of dizziness, which is exacerbated by drinking alcohol before bed. In general, drinking too much caffeine, too much alcohol, and not enough water, or taking diuretics can all lead to dizzy spells. Low blood sugar, whether due to diabetes, or simply not eating regularly enough, can also be a cause of light-headedness. [Hepatitis, HBV, or HCV](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-hepatitis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) can also cause dizziness. [Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pots-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) causes dizziness when moving from a seated or position or lying down to standing up. Cervical vertigo, or [cervicogenic dizziness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5759906/), is another type of vertigo caused by the positioning of the neck or cervical spine; in this case, the feelings of imbalance and spinning may be accompanied by [neck pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). This type of vertigo may happen, for instance, after a whiplash injury. Treatment for Vertigo The medical treatment for dizziness and [vertigo](https://wexnermedical.osu.edu/blog/vertigo-treatment) depends wholly on the underlying causes for the symptoms. If a bacterial infection in the ear is confirmed, then antibiotics may be used. In cases of BPPV, a canalith repositioning [procedure (CRP)](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/17930-canalith-repositioning-procedure-crp) is a non-invasive technique that can help the crystals within the inner ear move back into their proper place. Migraine-related vertigo may be treated with the medications typically prescribed for migraines. Anti-nausea drugs like Dramamine may be suggested. Patients suffering from cervical vertigo may be referred to physical therapy to help improve the positioning and strength of their neck/cervical spine. Can Acupuncture Help Dizziness? One of the central concepts of TCM is that of the root and the branches. The branches are the visible, outward signs or symptoms of a problem, while the root refers to what is going on deeper in the organ systems of the body. In the cases of dizziness and [vertigo](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=32770), there is deficiency in the root and excess in the branches. Pathogenic factors involved in dizziness and vertigo are phlegm, wind, fire, and deficient Qi. When there is weakness in organs like the spleen, stomach, kidney, or heart, pathogens like wind, heat, and phlegm can take hold. The San Jiao, also known as the \"triple burner,\" is another important concept in TCM; one of its primary functions is to control the movements of fluids in the body so that they don't collect and build up inappropriately. In case of vertigo, phlegm and heat develop to the point of causing stagnation and malfunctioning of the Jiao, pushing phlegm upwards in the body. An acupuncture practitioner will carefully listen and observe to discover which organ systems are out of balance, and work to strengthen those areas. For example, dizziness combined with emotional disturbances like anger and depression is a sign of too much wind or heat in the Liver. Weakness in the heart or spleen may follow a long illness or period of [stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) and [anxiety](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-anxiety-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/). Too much phlegm, heat, and dampness in the stomach and spleen can result from an improper diet and too much stress. Acupuncture and herbs to tonify these organs and clear heat and phlegm will take care of the root of the dizziness. Meanwhile, [specific acupuncture points](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) can have an almost immediate effect at relieving immediate discomfort, facilitating a natural vertigo cure. A study conducted at a hospital in Taiwan used acupuncture to treat patients with dizziness and vertigo. The [findings](https://www.healthcmi.com/Acupuncture-Continuing-Education-News/1496-acupuncture-relieves-dizziness-and-vertigo) conclusively showed immediate improvement in symptoms. A [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4459064/) of 60 patients who were admitted to an emergency room suffering from vertigo from a variety of causes, including Meniere's and BPPV, showed that acupuncture treatment provided immediate relief of symptoms and is therefore a good alternative for dizziness due to various causes. Top 5 Tips to Get Rid of Dizziness Depending on the cause of the vertigo, there are different ways to manage with TCM techniques, including vertigo exercises, acupressure for dizziness, moxibustion, and foods to avoid. Major 4 types of Vertigo/Dizziness presentation: - Hypertension type - When a person has high blood pressure, too much liver yang, and is overheated, it can cause dizziness. For this, we use acupressure Liver points 2 and 3 on the toes. - Qi and Blood deficiency - if a person shows signs of anemia, or has heavy periods, hemoglobin is low, or if a person has chronic conditions, or has suffered a major injury, or recently given birth, experienced major blood loss. For this we want to ensure a good diet with plenty of soups and easy to digest foods. Moxa on the back can help to strengthen the body's Qi and produce enough blood. Qi Gong exercise of squeezing the earlobes and outer ear up and down is helpful. - Kidney essence deficiency - this could be due to some constitutional weakness, or due to old age, or someone who tends to have chronic illness, diarrhea. The kidney essence can't support rising essence to the head. For this, acupressure for Kidney 1 - on the bottom of the foot. - Phlegm stagnation - when the middle jiao is not working due to stagnation of phlegm creating blockage so Qi cannot ascend. This happens when people are overweight, or have poor digestion, diarrhea. Avoid dairy and fried foods, which encourage phlegm. Moxibustion treatment to the back is helpful, and applying pressure to Stomach-36 acupressure point can help the middle jiao open up. - Neck Pain - if a neck problem is causing a blockage, due to a neck disease or [bulging disc](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-a-herniated-disc-with-acupuncture-tcm/), unhealthy cervical disks, compression, tension, and muscle spasms can block upwards energy. Exercises to encourage the health of the neck discs, loosen up the muscles and allow flow of Qi and blood up to the head. Your acupuncture practitioner will recommend neck exercises to help with this. Acupuncture Near Me for Dizziness Vertigo and dizziness may not be life-threatening symptoms, but they can have a big impact on your daily life. Frequently being blindsided by unexpected dizziness, spinning sensations, nausea, and headaches is unsettling and debilitating. Medications can be helpful in some cases, but they can also cause unwanted side effects. Getting to the root cause of vertigo with acupuncture and TCM will help get rid of dizzy spells so they don't keep coming back. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat TMJ With Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) is an acronym for \"temporomandibular joint,\" which is the double joint structure that attaches the lower jaw to the skull. \"TMJ\" is also used as a general term to refer to [disorders of the jaw joint](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tmj/symptoms-causes/syc-20350941). Popping or clicking of the jaw joints, tension or pain in the jaw, grinding teeth, headaches, neck pain, and shoulder pain can all be signs of a [TMJ disorder](https://www.uofmhealth.org/health-library/hw209469), or TMD. Acupuncture and TCM offer relief from TMJ jaw pain and [inflammation](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-reduce-and-prevent-inflammation/). The jaw joint is totally unique among joints in the human body in a few ways. It is really two joints that must always work together; you cannot choose to just move one side of your jaw. Also, the temporomandibular joint has two ways in which it moves; it \"hinges,\" and then, it \"slides.\" [Hinge joints](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK518967/), like the knees and elbows, allow flexion and extension on one plane, while remaining stabilized by a complex group of muscles, ligaments, and other connective tissues. Most of these joints are made of bones that are \"molded\" to fit and move together. [Gliding joints](https://www.innerbody.com/image_skel07/skel32.html), also called plane joints, like those in the ankles, wrists, and vertebrae, have flat sides that slide alongside each other when they move. The jaw joint combines both of these actions. Essentially the movement of the jaw is a kind of dislocation by design. Small discs of cartilage help to cushion the areas where the jawbone interacts with the sides of the skull in front of the ears. It can be difficult to determine the exact causes of \"TMD,\" or temporomandibular disorders that cause pain and dysfunction. Injury to the jaw, dislocation of the jaw, inflammation of tissues, [arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-arthritis-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), and bruxism (clenching or grinding the teeth and jaw) can all potentially lead to jaw pain or clicking in the jaw. Erosion or damage to the cartilage sometimes causes TMD, impacting the usually smooth motion of the opening and closing of the jaw. Structural issues like missing teeth or an uneven bite can cause jaw problems. [Dental and orthodontic work](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-toothaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) that requires the patient to hold the mouth open for long periods of time can sometimes lead to TMJ pain. Habitual movements like teeth grinding, biting on things like pencils, nail biting, or leaning your chin on your hand can also contribute to TMJ pain. Chronic pain syndromes like [fibromyalgia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-musculoskeletal-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) can also cause jaw pain. Most cases of TMJ disorders resolve themselves over time, usually within a few to several months. Resting the jaw and eating soft foods is usually recommended. Medical treatment usually involves medications to reduce inflammation and relieve pain while waiting for the jaw joint to gradually regain its normal function. Only in rare cases is surgery necessary to get rid of jaw pain. TMJ, or myofascial pain in the muscles around the jaws, is experienced by a third or more of all adults at some point in their lives. TCM modalities like [acupuncture can help](https://www.practicalpainmanagement.com/pain/maxillofacial/tmj/acupuncture-new-approach-temporomandibular-disorders) alleviate the pain and impeded mobility of the jaw joint caused by TMJ disorders. Top 10 Symptoms of TMJ Pain around the jaw joints that comes and goes is the most common complaint of people with TMJ disorders. However, problems with the jaw can contribute to pain and tension in other parts of the head and shoulders, too. The most common signs of TMJ include: - Pain in cheeks, tension in the jaw - Jaw clicking, popping of jaw bones - Limited movement of jaw, can't open jaw normally - Clenching of jaw, grinding teeth at night - Tooth pain, pain in the back teeth - Ear pain, [ringing in the ears, tinnitus](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-ringing-in-the-ears-with-acupuncture/) [Headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [migraines](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), pain behind eye, sensitive to light - Stiffness in shoulders or neck, [pain in neck](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-get-rid-of-neck-pain-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), [shoulder pain](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-shoulder-pain-by-acupuncture-and-tcm/) [Dizziness, vertigo](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) The combination of hard bony structures, muscles, and cartilage that are all involved in TMD causes TMJ pain that is hard to pinpoint because it may move around, and come and go. Most people describe the sensation as a dull ache. Some people don't experience pain, but still have trouble with jaw clicking or opening and closing the jaw. What Is the Treatment for TMJ? A doctor or dentist may check for signs of TMJ by observing and manually examining the movement of the jaw joint. Dental X-rays may be used to help determine the cause of jaw pain. CT scan or MRI may be recommended to get a more detailed look at the bones and cartilage. The primary recommendations for jaw pain and clicking is to rest the jaw as much as possible and eat only soft foods. Physical therapy (PT) can help strengthen the muscles of the face and encourage people to change habitual behaviors that might be contributing to TMJ. Wearing a splint or bite plate keeps the mouth and jaw in place and prevents grinding teeth in the night. This combination of PT and splinting is called stomatognathic treatment. If pain is serious enough to require further [medical treatment](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tmj/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350945), doctors will usually prescribe either pain relievers, anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxants, or some combination of these. Surgery is only used in rare cases when the jaw has become \"locked,\" or TMJ inflammation and pain has become chronic. Acupuncture and TCM treatment offer a way to reduce inflammation and pain related to TMJ disorders without risky surgical procedures or the adverse side effects sometimes caused by corticosteroids and other medications. Acupuncture Treatment for TMJ Acupuncture can work to reduce inflammation and [pain from many different conditions](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/pain/), including musculoskeletal disorders like TMD. Acupuncture is effective at reducing sensations of pain, both by reducing inflammation in areas from which the pain is originating and by stimulating the release of endorphins and other neurotransmitters that help boost feelings of well-being. [Acupuncture treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) can also help the muscles involved with jaw function to relax, alleviating the \"clicking\" or \"popping\" associated with TMJ disorders. In TCM theory, TMJ is often related to what we call different types of \"obstruction\" syndrome. [Stress](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-stress-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) and trauma, both physical and emotional, can cause Qi stagnation and/or blood stagnation. Pathogenic forces like cold, heat, wind, and damp can cause painful obstruction, or blockages of energy and blood in certain areas of the body. People suffering from TMJ do not necessarily only have dental pain or myofascial pain, a clicking jaw, or limited movement. They may also be experiencing a variety of other symptoms that are actually related. A TCM practitioner will look at the whole picture of what each patient is feeling, and treat accordingly. For example, a person with Liver Qi stagnation may have: - tension in the facial muscles - neck pain - feelings of anger or anxiety, - ringing in the ear, tinnitus - headaches A person with a Wind/Cold Bi Syndrome presentation might feel: - acute onset of pain - pain moves around from one area to another - aversion to wind and cold - fever, chills - ear ache, ringing in the ears As a holistic form of medicine, TCM works not only to relieve jaw pain and swelling, but to get to the root of the problem. [A comparative study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5340435/) designed to evaluate TCM treatment for TMJ found that patients who received acupuncture treatment reported less pain and muscle tenderness than those that did not. A [clinical study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3505698/) that compared groups of patients who received acupuncture treatment for TMJ pain and limited motion to patients treated with decompression splints. Both groups experienced reduction in pain and increased mobility, and the researchers concluded that acupuncture can be considered beneficial as either an adjunct or alternative treatment. In some cases, a stiff, painful jaw joint can be a secondary symptom of another, more systemic problem like [rheumatoid arthritis](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-rheumatoid-arthritis-ra-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or [fibromyalgia](https://myartofwellness.com/what-we-treat/fibromyalgia/). These conditions can also be addressed with acupuncture. Acupuncture Near Me for TMJ Disorders TMJ disorders interfere with a person's most basic activity: eating. While most cases of TMD improve within a matter of months with the proper rest, they can cause a lot of pain and frustration while a person is waiting to heal. Acupuncture and TCM herbs can help relieve TMJ pain and restore normal jaw function, helping people get back to normal more quickly than rest alone. At Art of Wellness, we have over 30 years of experience helping patients with musculoskeletal disorders and pain of all kinds find relief and a return to their usual mobility. *This article is for education from the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine only.

[ How to Treat Migraine with TCM and Acupuncture ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/) Tan, [Migraine](https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/what-is-migraine/) a disorder that affects about 10% of people worldwide; women are three times more likely to suffer migraine headaches than men. A migraine is an intense headache that lasts anywhere from several hours to three days and is severe enough to impede normal activities. The throbbing, pulsating, or stabbing pain in the head typical of a migraine is usually accompanied by a variety of other symptoms, including nausea and increased sensitivity to sensory stimuli. Migraines develop in stages over several hours or days, and the exact nature of the experience differs widely from person to person. Migraine is a recurrent condition, and patients are typically diagnosed with migraine if they have experienced at least five of these types of headaches in their lifetime. Some people suffer from chronic migraines that cause them to be debilitated several times per month. There are [different types of headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), but migraine headaches are distinct from [tension headaches, sinusitis headaches, and cluster headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/its-all-in-your-head-headaches-and-tcm/) in key ways. Although much [research](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Migraine-Information-Page) has been done, the physiological processes that cause migraines are still not completely understood. There is no cure for migraines, and treatment methods focus on preventing migraines from beginning or fully developing, and alleviating the symptoms until the attack abates. While more research is needed to demonstrate exactly how acupuncture impacts brain chemistry, [studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5931197/) have made it clear that TCM methods and [acupuncture treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/) are an effective alternative for relieving migraine. What Causes Migraine? Current medical theory generally attributes migraines to [abnormal neurological functions](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/headache/how-a-migraine-happens) in the brain cells. This may be due to genetics, as susceptibility to migraines does tend to run in families, especially from mothers to daughters. A cascade of chemical activity, possibly caused by fluctuations in hormones, causes the blood vessels to constrict, which leads to the pressure in head, throbbing pain and elevated nerve sensations. Migraines have also been linked to [carpal tunnel syndrome](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-carpal-tunnel-syndrome-with-acupuncture-tcm/), a nerve condition in which the median nerve is compressed. [TMJ, or disorders of the jaw](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), can also contribute to migraines. [Meniere's disease](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-menieres-disease-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), an inner ear problem that causes vertigo, dizziness, ringing in the ears, and nausea, has also been linked to migraines. [Occipital neuralgia](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-occipital-neuralgia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/), which occurs when the occipital nerves are compressed or irritated, can cause migraine-like pain in the back of head and neck. Stages and Symptoms of Migraine Migraines do not simply cause a severe headache. Migraine episodes go through a [pattern of stages](https://www.migrainetrust.org/about-migraine/migraine-what-is-it/symptoms-and-stages/), during which a variety of symptoms come and go. While a person may not be able to predict when a migraine will come on, once he or she is familiar with [these stages](https://migraine.com/migraine-basics/migraine-phases/), the course of the migraine attack is somewhat predictable. [Premonitory](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30074545/)or Prodrome Stage of Migraine - In the early part of the migraine, a person might experience physical signs such as stiffness in the neck (cervicogenic headache), especially on one side, frequent yawning, cravings for certain foods, marked thirstiness, and increased urination. Emotionally and mentally, a sense of fatigue, irritability, depression, or confusion might pervade. Some people feel hyperactive or even euphoric. This period can last for hours or days. - Aura - Not everyone who has migraines experiences what is known as the Aura phase, which produces unusual sensory distortions. In other cases, people may experience the Aura phase, but not the subsequent headache pain phase. Some examples of migraine with aura symptomology include: Allodynia (hypersensitivity to touch, so much that it is painful), [Metamorphopsia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23957288/)- a profound change in perception of the size of objects, including one's own body, altered spatial awareness, Aphasia - impairment in the language center of the brain that causes forgetting words, feeling generally unable to express oneself verbally, Visual - seeing wavy lines or flashing lights (phosphenes), \"blind spots\" or reduced field of vision (scotoma), Auditory - loss of hearing, auditory hallucinations, Headache and [dizziness or vertigo](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-dizziness-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). - Headache - Some people may have only mild pain during this phase, and therefore do not recognize they are having a migraine. Many migraine sufferers, however, experience severe throbbing headache, sharp pain in head, or stabbing pain (ice pick headache), often on one side of the head, headache back of head, headache behind eyes, or in the temples on head. The pain is usually worse if one is active. Heightened sensitivity to light, sounds, and smells are common, and people usually feel like retreating to a dark, quiet room to lie down. During this phase, people may also experience nausea and/or vomiting, dehydration, dizziness, hot flashes and/or chills, and strong emotions such as anxiety, fear, and depression. This phase can last anywhere from several hours to three days. - Postdrome - The final phase of migraine is sometimes likened to a \"hangover.\" People generally feel low energy and low mood, as well as fatigue and compromised cognitive function. This phase, too, can last several hours to a few days. Migraine episodes have a devastating impact on people's ability to function normally. More than half of migraine sufferers miss at least two days of work per month, and many more try to get through their workdays even though they are in the middle of a migraine. Are [Migraines Related to Hormones](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-daily-headaches/in-depth/headaches/art-20046729)? While anyone can have migraines, [women are three times more likely](https://migraineresearchfoundation.org/about-migraine/migraine-in-women/) to experience them, especially during their reproductive years. Many women perceive their migraine to be a [PMS headache](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) or period headache, because it occurs prior to or during the menstrual period. These types of migraine can be particularly debilitating. The cause of headache is believed to be due to a sudden drop in estrogen. This same mechanism can cause frequent headaches during perimenopause or early menopause due to fluctuations in estrogen levels. Sometimes women are prescribed the use of continual oral contraceptive medication (i.e., skipping the placebo week of pills) in order to prevent drops in estrogen that may be causing migraine. This treatment does not work for everyone, though, and obviously is not helpful for women who may wish to get pregnant. [Serotonin levels have also been linked to migraine](https://thejournalofheadacheandpain.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s10194-016-0711-0). Research has shown that fluctuations in neurotransmitters and vascular functions in the brain are part of the migraine pathology, but it remains unclear exactly how this plays out. Triptans, drugs which act upon the [serotonin](https://www.medscape.com/answers/1179268-119789/what-is-the-role-of-serotonin-in-the-pathogenesis-of-migraine) receptors in the brain, are currently the most common treatment for acute migraine, as in some cases, they will stop a migraine attack from progressing. These medications do not work for everyone, though, and they cause constriction of blood vessels, which can lead to other problems, such as tightness, tingling, and hot flushes in various parts of the body. Targeting the production and function of one of two specific hormones may produce some positive results, but as migraines appear to stem from a complex combination of hormonal, vascular, and metabolic malfunctions, a more holistic approach may be indicated. [Acupuncture has been shown](http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-REST200905007.htm) to help regulate hormones like estrogen and serotonin, specifically, but TCM achieves those results by observing and treating the whole person, emotionally, mentally, and physically; not only focusing on one or two isolated chemicals. Acupuncture and TCM for Migraine Help TCM theory is based on the concept of Qi as a life force energy which flows through the body along channels called meridians. Qi and blood move through these channels, several of which meet in the head. Blockages and stagnation in one organ system can impact other organ systems. Recurrent migraines are considered to be caused by stasis and deficiencies in the liver, spleen, and kidney, which cause yang energy from the liver to rise to the head. Overconsumption of the wrong kinds of foods can cause phlegm build-up in these organs, while alcohol and pungent foods can create excess heat energy. A typical [TCM treatment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3291665/) protocol might involve using specific acupuncture points and herbs to quench liver fire and eliminate phlegm. [Acupuncture can work on migraine pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3921614/) with its natural analgesic effects, while also helping to prevent future attacks by resolving these deeper organ system imbalances. [One study](https://www.acupuncturetoday.com/mpacms/at/article.php?id=27706) showed that migraine patients given acupuncture treatment experienced fewer episodes and missed fewer days of work than those given medications. The results also indicated that acupuncture was more cost effective than the medications. [A review of randomized trials](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001218.pub2/abstract) involving thousands of patients concluded that acupuncture is effective at reducing the number of days lost to migraines and should be considered a valuable treatment option. Top 5 Home Remedies for Migraine Headaches Migraines appear to be triggered by various stressors, lack of sleep, and certain foods. Aside from seeking acupuncture near me for migraine, there are several things you can do to prevent and relieve severe headaches. Natural remedies for migraines involve simple dietary, exercise and lifestyle modifications. - Avoid foods that can trigger migraines. The most common ones are processed or prepared foods with added nitrates or MSG. Dairy products, especially very salty or aged cheeses, and chocolate should be avoided if you are susceptible to migraine, as well as extremely cold drinks and desserts. Dried foods like fruits and beans, and pickled foods can also be problematic. - Emphasize foods high in magnesium, especially nuts, seeds, and high quality eggs. [Ginger](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23657930/)is known to relieve nausea and vomiting, and may alleviate other effects of migraine. One study showed that ginger was just as effective as Sumatriptan for decreasing symptoms of migraine. We recommend simply slicing fresh ginger root and steeping it in hot water to drink as a tea. - Try essential oils like lavender or peppermint. Rubbing a little bit into the temples can be soothing. - Find a gentle practice that combines breathing, movement, and meditation. [Yoga, particularly restorative yoga, has been shown](https://americanmigrainefoundation.org/resource-library/yoga-helps-headache/)to be helpful for headaches. This may be because it helps people relax more fully. It also encourages better symmetry between the right and left sides of the body and brain.

[ How to Treat Headaches with Acupuncture and TCM ](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-headaches-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) by Qineng Tan L.Ac., Ph.D. and Xiaomei Cai L.Ac., Ph.D. Headaches are extremely common. Virtually everyone gets a headache occasionally. But many people experience chronic and/or severe headaches that regularly disrupt their lives. With [acupuncture](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-acupuncture/) and TCM, it is possible to get to the root cause of your headache without relying on pain medications that only mask the problem and can cause side effects. [The first U.S. survey](https://headachejournal.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1526-4610.1998.3807497.x) study to examine the prevalence of different types of headaches showed that about 4% of the general population suffers from chronic headaches (defined as experiencing headaches about 180 days per year - or half the time). Half of those surveyed demonstrated characteristics of tension-type headaches, while roughly a third met the criteria for migraines. In fact, headaches are one of the conditions most commonly seen in acupuncture clinics today. TCM doctors using [acupuncture can offer relief headache](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/acupuncture-for-headache-2018012513146) without the side effects that prescription and over-the-counter drugs can cause. Headaches that can be treated with acupuncture include [migraines](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-migraine-with-tcm-and-acupuncture/), tension headaches, headaches occurring around the menstrual cycle, sinus headaches and stress-related headaches. In this article, we will analyze the various types of headaches and their causes, discuss how they can be treated with acupuncture and TCM, demonstrate scientific evidence of the efficacy of those treatments, and offer some great tips for how you can prevent and manage headache pain with lifestyle modifications. Seven Types of Headaches When treating with acupuncture, headaches are often classified by their location. This is only a broad guideline which needs to be further refined and integrated into the treatment for each individual, but this shows meridians and patterns that affect each area of the head. - Top of Head: liver Meridian (Liver Blood Deficiency, Liver yang Rising) - Sides of Head: Gall-Bladder Meridian (Liver-yang, Liver-Fire or Liver wind Rising) - One Side Only: Gall-Bladder Meridian (Liver-Yang or Liver-Fire Rising) - Temples: Gall-Bladder Meridian (Liver-Yang, Liver-Fire or Liver Wind Rising) - Behind the Eyes: Liver Meridian (Liver Blood Deficiency, Liver Yang Rising) - Forehead: Stomach Meridian (Stomach Deficiency or Stomach-Heat) - Whole Head: Kidney-Essence Deficiency or External Wind Many variables are taken into consideration in order to properly diagnose and successfully treat headaches. Each individual is treated differently depending on their unique symptoms. Some of the factors that will determine what acupuncture points and other treatment techniques are used include: what triggers the headache; the location, frequency and intensity of the headaches; the quality of the pain; the time of day that they occur, what helps the headaches and what makes them worse. What Causes a Headache? A patient's answers to the questions above help the TCM practitioner decide whether the headache stems from internal factors-such as emotions, hormone imbalance, [PMS,](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-pms-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) lack of sleep or nutrition-or from external factors-such as toxins in the environment, pinching in the neck due to pillow positioning, or [TMJ tension in the jaw](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-tmj-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/). [Occipital headaches](https://myartofwellness.com/how-to-treat-occipital-neuralgia-with-acupuncture-and-tcm/) occur when the occipital nerves in the back of the head and neck are irritated. The presenting symptoms, quality and location of the pain, also help to clarify whether there is a deficiency (tiredness) or an excess (feelings of anger). Often, there is a combination of various contributing factors, and the practitioner tailors the treatment to address them in concert. Acupuncture and TCM Herbs for Headaches Once the practitioner has determined the root causes of the headache, she will choose a combination of [points to stimulate with acupuncture treatment](https://myartofwellness.com/ultimate-guide-to-the-acupuncture-point-on-head-for-headaches/). Many migraine headaches are associated with the liver, for example, so points might be chosen to cool yang fire in the liver. Tension-type headaches may be related to tension in the neck and shoulders, so the acupuncturist will work to release blockages in those areas. Usually, patients are encouraged to get two treatments per week for eight weeks. Systematic reviews published by Cochrane in which the results of several scientific trials were consolidated demonstrate that acupuncture is an effective treatment for prevention and relief of both [ tension-type headaches](https://www.cochrane.org/CD007587/SYMPT_acupuncture-tension-type-headache) and [migraines](https://www.cochrane.org/CD001218/SYMPT_acupuncture-preventing-migraine-attacks). They showed that patients receiving acupuncture treatment had on average about half as many headaches as those patients not receiving acupuncture. The results were also long-term, lasting for months beyond the cycle of treatment. In addition to acupuncture treatment, the practitioner will likely recommend an [ herbal](https://myartofwellness.com/what-is-traditional-chinese-medicine/) formulation that will address the patient's specific needs. The daily use of the herb formula works to regulate the qi, balance yin and yang energies in the body, clear blockages and disperse stagnation. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4484556/) have shown that consistent use of herbs over a period of several weeks can help significantly reduce headache pain. Eight Self-Care Practices for Headache Prevention Healthy habits can help prevent or reduce the frequency and severity of headaches. Focus on what you can do to \"get ahead\" of your headaches. - Nutrition - Eat meals and snacks at regular times (every 3 hours or so) to maintain steady blood sugar levels. Avoid foods and drinks that are known to trigger headache attacks, including: processed meats, aged cheese, alcohol, and items sweetened with aspartame. Dehydration is a common cause of headaches; be sure to drink plenty of pure water throughout the day in addition to other liquids. - Sleep - Establish and maintain a regular sleeping schedule - rising and retiring at about the same time each day - including weekends and vacations. Sleep needs vary from person to person; figure out how much is optimal for you, and then strive for that nightly. - Stress - Stress is one of the most common headache and migraine triggers. Incorporate stress reduction techniques into your daily life. Set firm boundaries about taking on extra commitments, set aside time for meditation or other quiet activities that help you unwind and focus, such as knitting, reading, cooking - whatever brings you peace. Avoid screen time in the hour or two before bed, and establish a grounding morning routine that you practice before looking at email and rushing to get somewhere. - Activity - Cardiovascular exercise stimulates the body to release endorphins, which are brain chemicals that improve mood and relieve stress. Walking or hiking in nature is a great choice. Gentle stretching exercises such as yoga can help you become aware of tensions and release them. Massage is also helpful. - Acupressure points -For tension type headaches, try a pressure point called \"Large Intestine 4.\" This point is located between the thumb and forefinger. Apply firm pressure, squeezing deeply into the webbing there. - Headache Diary - Keep a diary of when your headaches occur, along with any triggers, and share the information with your healthcare provider. - See your healthcare provider - Make an appointment with your healthcare provider to specifically discuss your headache. - Be a partner in your headache care - Be informed, be a participant in your treatment and be an advocate for your headache care. Don't let chronic headaches keep interfering with your life. Talk to your TCM provider, and get started on a treatment regimen that will help you live more days headache-free.
