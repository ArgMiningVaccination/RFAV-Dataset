Luckily, there are many solutions to anxiety \u2014 some of which are natural and drug-free. From herbs to teas to practices, here are 7 all-natural remedies for anxiety. Chamomile Chamomile is proven a safe and effective way to treat anxiety. It's an herb that comes from a daisy-like plant and often dried into teas. It contains a compound called Matricaria Recutita that binds to the same brain receptors that drugs like Valium do. Take it supplementally or drink in teas. If you're on blood-thinning drugs, do not take chamomile. Lavender Lavender is a purple flower beauty with a knack for soothing stress. It works just as well aroma-therapeutically as it does when taken orally. Keep a small garden of lavender on your windowsill to ease tension in your home. Oral lavender can cause headaches in big doses, so start small. Lemon Balm Lemon balm is a beautiful green herb known for increasing mood and cognitive function. It reduces excitability and nervousness and is quite safe for short term use. Begin with small doses orally or use in teas! Too much lemon balm can actually increase anxiety, so be careful about increasing doses. Green Tea There's an amino acid in green teas called L-theanine. This compound curbs blood pressure and heart rate, often reducing anxiety. If you have low amounts of anxiety or nervousness, green tea is a great option. Take a Nature Bath One of the best ways to remedy anxiety is to get outside! Be in the sun, see green, get some perspective, and find some time for yourself. [Forest bathing is one of the most popular ways to de-stress and find peace outside](https://blog.gardenuity.com/how-forest-bathing-will-de-stress-your-life-make-you-happier/). To participate, find a piece of nature to meditatively walkthrough, focusing on your surroundings and the environment's impact on you. That being said, it doesn't have to be a big outing to be an effective de-stressing tool. Being outside in any capacity \u2014 whether that's on your patio, in a garden, or simply on a sidewalk \u2014 will help reduce anxiety. Meditation Our favorite of all the natural remedies for anxiety, Meditation. Meditation is a practice that is a huge tool for remedying anxiety. Rather than treating symptoms, meditation looks to the source of turmoil (the self) to heal and find harmony between your mind, body, and soul. Begin your at-home meditation practice in the garden with these tips. Exercise Exercising is one of the best temporary fixes for stress and anxiety. When you move, your body releases endorphins that make you feel euphoric. Exercise, whether that's running, yoga, or weights, can energize you and make you feel good! It can help you break out of moods that are detrimental. If you're experiencing anxiety, first and foremost consult your doctor and keep them informed of any supplementary remedies you use. "}
