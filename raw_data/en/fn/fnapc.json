Kathi Keville is an internationally known herbalist and aromatherapist and avid organic gardener. She has been highly recognized herb in the herbal and aromatherapy field since 1970 when she began teaching. She has been the Director of the American Herb Association since it's creation in 1981 and was a founding member of the American Herbalist Guild in 1989. Kathi was granted honorary membership to the National Association of Holistic Aromatherapy in and the American Aromatherapy Association for her pioneering work. She is also the editor of the AHA Quarterly Newsletter. See Kathi's history in the herb field (link coming soon). It's amazing that I can go out and buy several $20+ 'recommended' books, and the 5-8 dollar paperbacks end up being the best. Such is the case with Kathi Keville's Herbs for Health and Healing. While not an herbal that is the end all of every herbal out there, it's extremely informative, enlightening, easily digestible, and chocked full of useful information. The author genuinely has a love of herbs and a belief in their performance; for a change we have an herbalist who really is one, and not just trying to cash in on the latest craze. This little gem is broken down cleverly, with each section as exciting as the last. The introduction alone is useful, highlighting some of the common reasons to use herbs and natural remedies; she lists facts that are eye openers and refreshing. Why Use Herbs? further demonstrates her reasoning, listing the troubles of combating side effects, the benefits of herbs, how they work, why they do, and more. The second, Herbal Preparation, briefly touches upon various way to use herbal remedies and make your own. It's of course clear to see this should be included, and included in this order. She mentions main herbal preparations, with some brief illustrations. There is not outright detail, but it's clear enough to get the basic idea. The third section, Herbal Medicine, breaks down the larger sections into various body systems, beginning with the Brain and nervous system, ending with The skin. Each system is introduced with the roles it plays, things that can go wrong, and why they do. From here on she lists major complaints, symptoms and causes, backs up the herbs recommended with various studies, then backs up further with personal experience, and THEN usually has a basic formula to recommend. Excellent quick resource for a variety of maladies, clearly and confidently written. For part 3 we have Living with Herbal Wisdom. Here she devotes an entire chapter to Men's Health, then Women's, then Childrens. Everything from hormones and infertility, to colic, to male baldness is touched upon. The section for children is an especially welcome entry; teeting, earaches, sugar blues, you name it. And....this isn't all. Chapter 14 lists Herbal first aid, helping you establish a 'first aid kit' , why the herbs are recommended, how to use them, etc. Here she goes into detail on poison oak, ivy, bug bites, stings, mosquito repellants, and sunburns. Chapter 15, aptly titled Cautions and Considerations, warns about using things safely. Topics include essential oils, identification, contamination, endangered herbs, and rare reactions. 16 dives briefly into the huge pool of aromatherapy, something that is obviously a first love for Kathi. In fact, she has other books on this subject alone. Techniques and measurements are all laid out. The list keeps growing - chapter 17 brushes upon Skin Care - including hair of course. Homemade beauty recipes, as well as combating skin issues and problems - are mentioned. Great extra! Finally, chapter 18 is about cooking for health - delicious recipes are given for soups, oils, vinegar, spices, pestos, veggies, hot sauces, homemade coffees, ending with candies such as ginger and horehound drops. I repeat, sometimes the more expensive, bigger, prettier book is skimpier. From skin and cosmetics to cooking to first aid to body conditions, it's all here. It's not the most advanced herbal out there but it's not too basic for those with experience. Beginners will easily understand, while those who know their stuff will keep learning as the page turns. At this price, it's a bargain, a steal, almost a sin if not purchased. I chose to read Kathi Keville's \"Herbs for Healing: A Drug-Free Guide to Prevention and Cure\", a nonfiction piece published in 1996 by Rodale Press, Inc. I personally wanted to read this book because I enjoy reading about ways to alleviate or cure health issues. I personally use more modern pharmaceuticals for things like my skincare and other health issues I might come across, but it was interesting to read about another alternative to modern cures. When reading this book, my first impression was that nobody still uses herbs because they are outdated for their use, except for things like tea. However, this book has opened my eyes to more and more possibilities for remedies. Since this book was organized into chapters that share herbal remedies for specific health issues, I was able to skip straight to the specific health issue chapters I was interested in and read each individually. Since I was completely new to the concept of using herbs for health issues, I decided to read Chapter 1, \"Why Use Herbs?\". This chapter gave me just enough information to continue onto the other sections and understand the pros and cons of herbs. I really enjoyed this section because it also discussed ethical concerns regarding the use of herbs which I questioned as I was reading the book. Next, I read Chapter 11, \"Women's Health\". This chapter, like the others, had multiple subsections, but I specifically remember a lot from the section called \"Irregular Menstruation\". This section gave a remedy called a Hormonal Tonic, a mixture of vitex berries, roots and motherwort leaves. I learned not only the recipes for things like this tonic, but what they actually do to the body and why it helps the body recover. Throughout the book, the concept of holistic healing is referenced because that is how herbal medicine works as opposed to pharmaceutical drugs. For example, a tonic is going to heal the overall body so that the issue is resolved. This is unlike a drugstore acne spot treatment, which will only heal the surface of the pimple, not what's unbalanced in the body to cause the acne. I liked this aspect of the book because before learning about herbs for healing, I was curious as to how tea could possibly help things like period cramps. Lastly, I read about common names and botanical names for herbs, two things that were used frequently in this book. It was very helpful, and was almost like a reference dictionary for me. I wasn't familiar with many of these herbs, let alone their names so I liked that about this book. Overall, I recommend this book to people who have health issues that they are trying to resolve in a different way than using drugs. I also recommend this to people who are interested in plants or botanical nomenclature. I enjoyed this book and would give it an overall rating of 9/10. I liked everything about it except for the fact that the author rarely used statistics to back up her claims. Instead, she used personal experiences and stories of people she knows personally. I found this book very approachable, with great information about applications and recipes for specific ailments. I particularly appreciated the section devoted to women's health. A lot of herbal remedy books will prescribe various herbs for things like PMS, but without going into any further detail. PMS is an umbrella term for all sorts of things like fatigue, breast soreness, uterine cramps, water retention, headache, mood sensitivity, etc. This book actually explains what causes these ailments, like the drop in magnesium and calcium in the body after ovulation, and goes on to explain why certain herbs are particularly beneficial. I also like the approach it takes, regarding herbs as way of healing inbalances in the body and/or maintaining balance, and not just a treatment for sickness. My mom bought me this book when I had my first child in 1996. It still is one of my very favorite books. I love her recipes, stories and expertise. This is definitely a family heirloom. I cannot recommend "}
