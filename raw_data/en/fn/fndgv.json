We also provide practical ways to protect these vital divine gifts. Previously: Though small, the spleen performs a multitude of critical functions, but recent studies have found that COVID-19 can decimate it. The spleen protects us in many remarkable ways, so it's essential to learn how we can keep it healthy. Although we can live without a spleen, having it surgically removed can create serious long-term consequences, putting us at risk for severe, life-threatening infections. A Study of Army Servicemen Without a Spleen In 1977, the National Cancer Institute, National Academies of Sciences, and National Research Council conducted a [groundbreaking study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/69206/#:~:text=A%20long%2Dterm%20follow%2Dup,also%20increased%2C%20but%20not%20significantly) that followed 740 U.S. servicemen whose spleens had been removed because of trauma during World War II. After monitoring the servicemen for 28 years, the study found that they suffered significantly higher mortality rates from pneumonia and heart disease, regardless of age or the length of time since their surgeries. The spleen is crucial for [removing microorganisms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537307/) such as bacteria or viruses and for creating substances that can clear out pathogenic invaders, thus helping the body's defense system. Removing the spleen can result in an increased number of abnormal blood cells. Since the organ is also responsible for filtering and recycling blood clotting factors such as platelets, removing it may result in an increased number of platelets in the blood. One's platelet number may remain high for a long time, ultimately speeding up the formation of plaques in coronary arteries and leading to heart disease. Severe Infection After Spleen Removal Is Common Spleen removal isn't a benign procedure; it can increase one's risk of death, as well as of suffering a collapsed lung, inflammation of the pancreas, blockages in the lung blood vessels, and excessive bleeding. In the long term, removing the spleen places the patient at a significantly higher risk of developing an overwhelming infection, regardless of age. Infections can quickly progress from a mild flu-like illness to life-threatening sepsis, even in those vaccinated to prevent infection. A review study found that the mortality rate for individuals experiencing infection can reach a staggering [38 to 70 percent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919114009650#:~:text=Overwhelming%20post%2Dsplenectomy%20infection%20), despite the use of treatments including antibiotics, steroids, and fresh plasma. The [incidence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3327338/) of overwhelming severe infection after a splenectomy ranges from 2.5 to 13.5 percent. The risk of infection is greatest within the first two years, but up to [33 percent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919114009650#bib8) of complete splenectomy patients will experience infection within 10 years of removal. One's level of risk depends on age and medical conditions. The [symptoms](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743919114009650#:~:text=Overwhelming%20post%2Dsplenectomy%20infection%20) of infection include but are not limited to fatigue, weight loss, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea, and headaches. What Causes the Severe Infection? Normally, our body's immune system fights infection in a controlled way. However, when the immune system goes into overdrive, infectious agents and inflammatory chemicals can circulate throughout the body, causing a vicious cycle and lethal outcome: sepsis. Post-splenectomy sepsis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa (e.g., malaria parasites), or [encapsulated bacteria](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.11.005), which have an extra layer that protects them. The immune systems of splenectomy patients have a harder time killing off encapsulated bacteria, which are frequently associated with severe infections in this population. The most nefarious such pathogen is [Streptococcus pneumoniae](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2018.02674/full), but Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis are also significant. Because these organisms are enclosed in capsules, they can survive when the spleen is not helping to produce bridging molecules (e.g., complements and antibodies) or when the macrophages (scavenger cells) in the spleen are unable to remove them effectively. Spleen's Super Weapons to Kill Encapsulated Germs Pathogenic bacteria can be crafty little devils, especially the encapsulated ones. We rely on some highly intelligent, super-powerful weapons to take down these elusive germs. Inside the small but mighty spleen, [macrophages](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK27100/#:~:text=The%20most%20important%20action%20of,receptors%20(CRs)%20on%20phagocytes.) battle to scavenge bacterial invaders. With the help of [complements](https://www.nature.com/articles/220506a0) and [antibodies](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.me.37.020186.000405) (two types of proteins produced by the spleen), these macrophages can grab encapsulated bacteria and gobble them up like a handful of candy. Complements produced by the spleen can form a group called the membrane attack complex (MAC). The MAC breaks down the membrane of bacteria in a process called lysis, which disrupts the balance inside a bacterium and ultimately kills it. Without these complements and antibodies, our immune system is severely handicapped in its ability to fight off these protected pathogens. The spleen is also a major hub for producing specific antibodies that bind to pathogens and play a crucial role in the early stages of infection. Losing the spleen means losing a critical command center for the immune system and blood recycling. So it's important to do all we can to protect and keep our spleen whenever possible. Without a spleen, the immune system is weaker and more vulnerable to infection. That means special treatments are required. The most critical treatment for an infection after spleen removal is the immediate use of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics, which may reduce mortality to about [10 to 40 percent](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1011306/) from 70 percent. Be Mindful of an Abnormal Spleen If a physician can feel your spleen during an examination, that usually means it's enlarged and unhealthy. Splenomegaly, or an enlargement of the spleen, affects about [2 percent of the U.S. population](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK430907/). An enlarged spleen increases the risk that the organ will [rupture](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525951/), which can be life-threatening. Possible causes of an enlarged spleen include: - trauma - heart failure - liver cirrhosis - leukemia - cancer - infections - autoimmune diseases such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis - COVID-19 infection and [COVID-19 vaccination](https://casereports.bmj.com/content/14/12/e243846) - abscesses - excess alcohol use - fatty liver 6 Practical Ways to Protect Your Spleen Always Fasten Your Seat Belt The highest risk to your spleen is trauma from external injury. Buckle up before driving or riding in a car, since a car accident will likely damage your spleen and can lead to serious complications, or even death. Eat a Healthy Diet With More Beans Unhealthy dietary patterns can lead to chronic inflammation that can disrupt the normal function of the spleen. A [2018 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6198361/) found that feeding mice a diet high in fat and added sugar for 12 weeks led to obesity, high blood sugar, elevated inflammatory markers, and spleens that were 50 percent larger than those of mice fed a standard diet. Following the 12 weeks, spleen size was reduced through exercise and treatment with [genistein](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2022.820969/full), a natural compound found almost exclusively in legumes, including in [soybeans](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf00035a027), [lupins](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1744-7348.1994.tb04958.x), and [fava beans](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fneur.2021.761912/full). It's also important to chew food slowly, which optimizes digestion and reduces the burden on the spleen. Eat Spleen-Nourishing Herbs Korean ginseng berries were found to have the potential to [boost the immune](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3659612/) system and improve spleen function. In a [2021 study](https://www.jmb.or.kr/journal/view.html?doi=10.4014/jmb.2110.10021), extracts from the berries were given to mice with weakened immune systems. The extracts improved the function of natural killer cells and increased the production of lymphocytes in the spleen. Immune-related genes were also found to be more active. These effects depended on the amount of extract given. A [long-term evaluation](https://bmccomplementmedtherapies.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12906-022-03736-5) of Korean red ginseng, which contains these extracts, found that it's safe and suggested that it improves immune system activity and reduces viral infections. Ginseng is considered a [promising herb](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8783644/) for the treatment of viral infections, including COVID-19. It's reported to boost innate and adaptive antiviral immunity and increase the function of macrophages and natural killer cells. Other herbs that can help to improve spleen and immune function include [licorice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8703329/) and [Chinese yam](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0924224423000511). Increase Movement to Boost Lymphatic Flow Our lymph fluid can move through the body by itself, but drainage of the lymphatic system works better with increased movement, including regular exercise, which can help the spleen filter and transform particles in our lymph fluid. All the methods described in [ Part 4](https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/beyond-detox-unlocking-the-secret-healing-power-of-the-lymphatic-system_5177964.html) and [Part 5](https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/covid-vaccine-detox-lymphatic-system_5184858.html) of this series will help our spleen to function more effectively. Reduce Stress and Make Relaxation a Priority Are you feeling stressed out? Your lymphatic, immune, and spleen functions are all vulnerable to the effects of stress. Our brain communicates with our organs, and when they sense that we're in a threatening situation, hormones are released that can lower our immune system's ability to defend itself. Stress is generally an internal response to external events, such as an argument or work pressure. It goes away once our perception changes or the stressor is resolved. Stress can be either positive or negative. Anxiety is usually a reaction to stress. It often involves a persistent feeling of dread that can interfere with your life. It can be constant, even when there's no immediate threat. Modern psychoneuroimmunological research has proven that [chronic stress](https://www.nature.com/articles/nri1571) can weaken the immune system and indirectly interfere with spleen function, causing inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcers, and much more. Studies have shown that prolonged stress can lead to [anxiety](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/psyp.12634). The influence of [anxiety on spleen function](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=70135) is likely also mediated by both nervous and endocrine factors. So how can we combat high amounts of stress? The answer is to make relaxation a priority. Try performing relaxing exercises such as yoga and qigong, spending time in nature, taking warm baths, or consuming [adaptogenic herbs](https://www.theepochtimes.com/health/5-natural-herbs-help-alleviate-stress-and-anxiety-holistically_5135123.html?ea_src=open&ea_med=search). Avoid Overthinking [Uncertainty can be unhealthy](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.576001/full) because it can make it difficult to concentrate on tasks requiring executive function. One reason for this may be that we conserve energy when we're unsure about things. Uncertainty was shown to impair the performance of tasks even more than when we're certain of negative outcomes. In traditional Chinese medicine, the spleen is linked to the \"earth.\" When we worry too much, we're \"up in the clouds.\" Being more relaxed and mindful can help us to feel more grounded, which can help us worry less and keep our spleen healthier. When you take care of yourself by relaxing, staying grounded, avoiding overthinking, and trying to be more decisive, you will help to keep your immune system and spleen healthy. The spleen is an important organ, and its loss or injury can be devastating to our health. Being proactive by implementing these practical ways to safeguard this vital organ will support your spleen's ability to function as it was miraculously designed, providing a lifetime of health benefits. Next: One of the most mysterious immune organs in our lymphatic system, the thymus gland also plays a critical function in the endocrine system by making and releasing hormones.
