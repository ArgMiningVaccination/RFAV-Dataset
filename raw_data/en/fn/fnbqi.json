They do this by working on the essential organs of detoxification - this includes your digestive tract , liver, gallbladder, and kidneys. All of these herbs support your liver but they also promote better breakdown of food in your intestines and improve elimination of waste through your digestive tract. Optimizing your digestive function and promoting better bowel elimination (i.e. pooping better) is your body's most important way to detoxify! These herbs can be taken together for a synergistic and enhanced effect. Dandelion root supports function of both the liver and kidneys. Both of these organs are essential for helping your body rid waste and toxins. Dandelion root is a bitter herb that stimulates digestive enzyme release and increases digestive function throughout the entire digestive tract. It is a choleretic and cholagogue which means it stimulates release and flow of bile into the intestines. Having good bile flow is an essential piece of the detoxification process because the bile's job is to grab onto the waste and toxins so that they can be eliminated through the stool. Milk thistle is anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and protects the liver and kidneys. This herb is the most important herb for repairing a damaged liver and protecting the liver from harmful substances in our environment. Milk thistle increases levels of our body's master antioxidant Glutathione. Glutathione is essential for repair of our body's cells and is needed to run our liver's detoxification system. Artichoke is another powerful bitter herb that stimulates digestion, promotes bile flow and improves elimination of waste through the stool. Artichoke also helps repair the liver and is helpful when there is liver inflammation and blood stagnation through the liver. Artichoke is a carminative herb and is helpful in reducing gas and bloating that may occur after meals. Editor's Note: The information in this article is intended for your educational use only.
