Headaches can range from mild, dull aches to severe, debilitating pain accompanied by nausea. The location of the headache and the type of pain you're feeling are good indications of the kind of headache you are experiencing. Tension headaches are the most common type and can appear as pain almost anywhere in the head, scalp, or neck. Chiropractic care has been proven to relieve tension headaches often caused by stress and back or neck strain. Conversely, migraines are throbbing headaches that can cause debilitating pain, nausea, and sensitivity to the surrounding environment. The pain associated with migraines can last from a few hours to several days. While some people may reach for over-the-counter pain relievers when experiencing a headache, there is a way to get natural headache relief. Chiropractic care can be an effective treatment for various headaches, without medication.

Headaches & Upper Back Pain That Can Be Relieved With Gonstead Chiropractic Adjustments Are you looking for natural headache relief? Headaches and upper back pain can stem from various factors, including spinal subluxations, blood vessel issues, poor posture, muscle discomfort, and nerve problems. Here at Nordik Chiropractic, we understand how subluxation can cause headaches. Upon diagnosis, we can provide effective natural headache relief without medication. Upper Back Pain: There can be many causes of upper back pain. These may include poor posture, perhaps from sitting or sleeping in a bad position. It can also be caused by injuries or other subluxation issues. These causes are treatable with chiropractic and treatment can usually offer fast relief from upper back pain. Tension Headache: Neck and upper back pain commonly cause tension headaches, which can be short-lived or last for days. Poor posture, extra stress, and subluxation are among the root causes of tension headaches. Chiropractic care can provide lasting relief or prevention by gently manipulating the back, neck, and spine muscles. Our chiropractors can help relieve the tension that causes headache pain and prevent future or permanent damage to muscles and ligaments. Cervicogenic Headache (CGH): Cervicogenic headaches (CGH) often starts as a dull ache in the neck and moves up the back of the head, usually affecting only one side. Pain may also spread to the temple, forehead, and around the eyes and ears. CGH is generally caused due to joint, muscle, underlying disc, or nerve disorders in the neck usually causes CGH. Migraine: Migraines are recurring headaches that cause mild to severe pulsating pain on one side of the head. They may also cause nausea and sensitivity to light and sound. Neck pain is often associated with migraines and may start before or during the attack. For the treatment of migraine headaches, [Studies have shown](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001878.pub2/full) that spinal manipulation can be \"an effective treatment option with a shortterm effect similar to that of a commonly used, effective drug (amitriptyline).\" Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Headache: TMJ headaches often start as dull aches around the temples and TMJ area and may be mistaken for earaches. TMJ disorders can cause headaches and other discomfort, including muscle fatigue or weakness in the TMJ. Furthermore, bruxism, the involuntary grinding or clenching of teeth, can lead to face and neck soreness. Unfortunately, many people are unaware of this condition because it can happen during sleep. Occipital Neuralgia: Occipital neuralgia can be a debilitating condition that causes intense shooting pain in the back of the head, neck, and ears. Often described as electric-shock-like sensations, the pain can be one-sided and start in the upper neck before spreading to the head. This condition is typically caused by irritation or injury to the occipital nerve. Chiropractic care can offer relief from this condition through gentle, non-invasive treatments that reduce inflammation and promote healing in the affected area. Proper spinal alignment can alleviate pressure on the nerves. Chiropractors can help ease the pain and discomfort associated with occipital neuralgia.
