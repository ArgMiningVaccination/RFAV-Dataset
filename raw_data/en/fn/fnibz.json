It's cardio- vascular disease, which is the No. 1killer for both men and women in the United States, claiming more lives each year than the next five causes of death\u2014cancer,respiratory diseases, accidents, diabetes, and influen-za and pneumonia\u2014combined. Stroke, meanwhile, is the leading cause of severe long-term disability. At Monmouth Medical Center, our commit- ment to excellence has led to some exciting develop- ments in the fight against heart disease and stroke. Last year, Monmouth\u2014led by the hospital's chief of cardiology, John Checton, M.D., and directorof interventional cardiology, Rita Watson, M.D.\u2014 joined a select group of New Jersey hospitals for anational medical trial led by Johns Hopkins University. For the trial, physicians performed elec- tive balloon angioplasty to open clogged coronaryarteries in cardiac patients, without cardiac surgery.The availability of angioplasty services means thatheart -attack patients, such as Oceanport 's Ronald Graniero, who is profiled in this issue's Health Link section, no longer have to be transferred to anotherfacility to receive this advanced, state -of-the-art care\u2014it 's available right here. In addition to the introduction of this key ser- vice, in 2005 Monmouth Medical Center earnedaccreditation as a Chest Pain Center by the National Society of Chest Pain Centers. The hospital thus became the first in the region to gain this importantaccreditation, designed to provide a comprehensivemanagement strategy for the evaluation, triage andappropriate treatment of chest-pain patients.Monmouth has also developed a Stroke Center\u2014a center of e xcellence dedicated to delivering the highest-quality comprehensive care to stroke patients. According to the American Heart Association, the availability of new therapies to treat patients effi - ciently and safely is dependent on the development of specialized teams with expertise and experience, aswell as detailed clinical protocols. At Monmouth, our multidisciplinary teams are trained and dedicated to the treatment of cardiovas - cular patients throughout the full continuum of care.Thwarting a killer Sincerely , FRANK J. V OZOS , M.D., FACS Executive Director Monmouth Medical Center The years change all of us, and for T erry Ingram of Oceanport, 60, they have erased one habit of youth. \"I used to read the end of a book before thebeginning, so there'd be no surprises,\" she says. T oday, though, she's con-tent not to know what future chapters in the book of life have in store. Friends know In - gram as a committed vol - unteer. For 11 years she's helped organize the annual Two Rivers Antiques Show and Garden T our, held to raise funds for the Jac- queline M. Wilentz Com- prehensive Breast Centerat Monmouth Medical Center. And for the pastfour years she's chaired the event, supervising 30 othervolunteers on 10 committees. But her friends may notall know the challenges she's faced at the same time. Two years ago, Ingram 's husband, Steve, 62, suffered a cerebral aneurysm. For five months she was with him in the hospital every day as he struggled to regain his health. He underwent rehabilitation, and Ingram directed a remodeling of their home to accommodate his needs. F or a while he was progress - ing. But then he contracted meningitis and died. Along with her grief , Ingram faced the task of sorting out papers in her husband's law office\u2014 he'd had a solo practice, so there was no partner to help\u2014and stacks of hospital bills to resubmit to an insurance company that at one point had denied reimbursement for k ey services. Was this, perhaps, a time to tak e a break from the burdens of volunteering? Not for Ingram. On the contrary , she says, working on the show and tour was the one thing in her life that was \"normal.\" \"The Antiques Show and Garden T our was part of my old life, as opposed to everything that wasgoing to be new ,\" she says. There was solace in the familiar work, she says, and in \"people being happy with what we'd done, withthe money we'd raised.\" There was also a more personal reason tocarry on the fight againstbreast cancer\u2014regardless of the battles under way on other fronts. The ill-ness had claimed the livesof two of Ingram 's aunts, and she'd been by the side of a good friend during a 10-year losing struggle with the disease. Ingram recalls how the two womenstaffed a reception tableat one of the gardens onthe tour together, taking questions about plants. \"I know the money we're raising is going to a good cause,\" says Ingram, noting that in 12 years theshow and tour have netted the medical center $2 mil - lion for upgrades to ultrasound technology , digital mammography and other services. (This year's event, held F riday , June 8 through Sunday , June 10, will fea - ture a tour of six local gardens and an antiques show at the Red Bank Armory Ice Comple x.) Today , life has calmed down, and Ingram con - tinues the work that kept her going during her hus- band's illness. She walks Annie, her Cavalier King Charles spaniel, each morning at 7:45 and tends regularly to her own garden\u2014vegetables rather thanflowers. She visits her mother , who still lives in Baltimore, where Ingram grew up, and her two sons and their families in W ashington, D.C., and Arling- ton, V irginia. And she finds time to babysit for her 2- and 3-year-old grandsons when they visit her in her childproofed, toy -filled home. Inevitably, some of life's surprises are difficult ones. This dedicated volunteer meets them withgrace, sustained by the solace of helping others. IN A TOUGH TIME, HER VOLUNTEER WORK KEPT LIFE 'NORMAL'byBarbara Franzese CronCHRISTOPHER BARTHThe solace of helping 28 / MAY 2007profile You'd think it would be a slam dunk. Children are our most vulnerable citizens, with the most future years riding on their good health. Surely providing optimal health care services to young people should be at the top of society 's agenda. Sadly , it isn 't always true. \"Children don 't vote,\" says Margaret C. Fisher, M.D., medical director of The Children's Hospital at Monmouth Medical Center. \"So chil-dren 's issues sometimes get put on the back burner .\" Indeed, politicians are still struggling to figure out how to extend health care coverage to all young people. But there's one kind of institution that hasalways put the care of children first, priding itself on its sensitivity to their needs and their families' needs. That's the children's hospital. In nearly a century and a half since the first U.S. chil- dren 's hospital (Children 's Hospital of Philadelphia) opened its doors in 1855, these facilities have earned a reputation as \"special, someeven say miraculous, places,\" as the National Asso- ciation of Children 's Hospitals and Related Institutions (NA CHRI) puts it, \" where everything is kid- sized and child-friendly, and even the sickest children havethe hope of becoming healthy once again.\" That 's why it was good news for children 's care in Monmouth and Ocean counties when MonmouthMedical Center 's pediatric facilities won formal des - ignation in December 2005 as one of America's roughly 250 children's hospitals. \"State law defineswhat you need to qualify for that label,\" says Dr . Fisher , \"including an intensive-care area, a pediatric emergency room, a pediatric residency program and membership in NACHRI. It's a whole different levelof sophistication and commitment.\" The level was new for Monmouth, but the commitment wasn't. Back in 1968, the medical cen- ter established New Jersey 's first neonatal intensive care unit\u2014and the first in a community hospital in the U .S.\u2014to care for infants born prematurely or in distress. In the years since, the medical center has tak en a num - berof additional strides in pediatric care\u2014not least in 2000, when it attracted Dr. Fisher, a nationally recognized infectious -disease spe- cialist who serves on the American Academy of Pediatrics Red Book Committee, which sets guidelines for vaccinations. T oday , Monmouth 's Children's Hospital offers the community the services of 140 pediatric specialists in morethan 30 k ey specialties, with more than 50 pro - grams for children and adolescents. On the ne xt three pages you 'll read more about the services Monmouth provides as a chil- dren 's hospital. HEALTH WHAT 'S NEW IN MEDICINE AND HOW YOU CAN STAY WELLLinkDAWN HUDSON 32 / MAY 2007 Children's hospitals on average devote 60 per cent of their car e to youngsters under age 6, and 26 per cent of their beds to intensive care (compared with9 per cent in general hospitals). Children's hospitals handle about 1.6 million emer gency-r oom visits yearly. Source: National Association of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutionsfast factsWhat it takes to earn the label 'children's hospital' With this designation, Monmouth Medical Center shows its commitment to caring for young peopleA special place for the young JEFF BURKE MONMOUTH HEALTH &LIFE / 33In the late 1970s, when 9-year-old Valerie Goldstein lost her fight against cancer, her par-ents sought to honor her memory. They didn't want future children with serious illnesses tohave to travel several times a week to New York or Philadelphia for treatment as Valerie had done. So they created the V alerie Fund Children 's Center , New Jersey's first compre- hensive care facility for children with cancer and blood disorders. T oday the state has six such centers, and one of them is part of The Chil - dren's Hospital at Monmouth Medical Center. The Valerie Fund Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders offers chemo - therapy , blood transfusions and other services in a setting de - signed to cheer spirits as it pro- vides treatment. \"It's about aswarm and fuzzy as you can get\u2014in the least warm and fuzzy part of your life,\" says Tim McLoone of Little Silver, whose 10-year-old son, Jack, is being treatedfor leuk emia at the facility . The center has a dedicated physician, Joanna Luty , M.D., and two nurses on staff in addi- tion to nurse practitioner Susan Dulczak, who since late 2004has been clinical director . A child life specialist, a social worker and a pediatric psycholo- gistwork with the center , which treats about 10 young people a day, from infancy up to age 21. Compared with similar units at urban treatment centers, the Valerie Fund Children's Center is smaller and also, as Dulczak says, \"calmer and quieter .\" But it provides the same high level of care and services,adhering to state -of-the-art national clinical protocols developed by the Children 's Oncology Group, a coop - erative group backed by the National Cancer Institute. In 2005, the center completed an ambitious$178,000 renovation, incorpo- rating an exterior face-lift and abeach d\u00e9cor suggested by the kidsthemselves. One patient room has an e xam table made out of a surfboard; in another, the table is a boat. A room for toddlers has a little car in it, and a more sedately outfitted room is full ofrecreational equipment for teens. \"When our kids get infu- sion therapy or blood transfu - sions, they're in a room that's like a cinema with red velvet curtains, where they can sit in big red recliners and watch a movie or play on a computer,\" says Dulczak. Pia Binns of R umson says her 3-year -old daugh- ter, Isabella, cooperates with the rigorous treatment schedule for her leuk emia because she feels safe at the center . \"Everyone's nice, and they have everything she enjoys\u2014from a playroom to movies to art supplies\u2014so she never gives us trouble about going ,\" says Binns. At the Valerie Fund Children's Center, giraf fes ador n the walls and childr en get infusion therapy in a \"cinema.\" Treating cancer and blood disorders When youngsters need treatment, the Valerie Fund Children's Center is a friendly place to get it On the fourth Thursday evening in alternate months, a group of 10 to 15 people\u2014parents and children\u2014 gathers in the office of Jonathan T eitelbaum, M .D., a pediatric gastroenterologist at The Children's Hospital at Monmouth Medical Center . The kids look like ordinary youngsters, but they have a com- mon trait that doesn 't show . They're members of what is thought to be New Jersey 's first support group for children with inflammatory bowel disease. \"I started the group last year , after patients kept telling me they felt like they were the only one,\" says Dr . T eitelbaum. \"Inflammatory bowel disease is tough, because although the kids look normal on the outside they have a lot of belly pain, go to the bath- room frequently and often have bloody stools.\" Many young patients said they didn 't feel comfortable discussing their problem with their friends, so they welcomed a chance to meetother kids who were fighting the same battle. Dr.Teitelbaum often attends the Thursday meetings,as do a psychologist and a social worker. Inflammatory bowel disease includes Crohn 's disease and ulcerative colitis, each of which affects about five children in every 100,000 in the U .S. each year. Crohn's disease can involve any part of the intestinal tract and can cause narrowing of the intestine or eventrigger the formation of new connections of tissue in the intestine or between the intes - tines and the bladder or skin. Ulcerative coli - tis affects only the colon, or large intestine. T reatment may involve dietary changes such as going on an all-liquid diet for a while,but children often find this difficult. Medica - tions may also be used. They include anti - biotics, preparations that coat the intestine with aspirin-like medicines, those that suppress theimmune system and oral corticosteroids todecrease inflammation. The fifth\u2014and newest \u2014type of medication is biologics, which are given intravenously every one to two monthsand act on specific chemicals in the body. \"The biologic that has been approved for use in children with inflammatory bowel disease is called infliximab [Remicade],\" Dr . Teitelbaum e xplains. \"It's an antibody that targets a chemical called tumor necrosis factor , which is important in causing a lot of the irritation in these patients.\" If these don 't work , says the doctor, \"there's surgery . It's not the first treatment of choice, but some patients need it, depending on the severity of their disease and our ability to control it with medicine.\" Dr. T eitelbaum is involved in research and is a board member of the New Jersey chapter of the Crohn 's and Colitis F oundation of America, working to find a cure for inflammatory bowel disease. The bimonthly support group for children with inflammatory bowel disease and their par ents at The Children's Hospital at Monmouth Medical Center meets the fourth Thursday in alternate months (it's due to meet in April and June) at 7 p.m. in Suite 210 at255 Third Avenue in Long Branch. Drop-ins are welcome, but you canfind out more about the group\u2014or about the treatment of Crohn'sdisease and ulcerative colitis at Monmouth\u2014by calling 732-923-6080.

NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT (NICU) Sometimes babies need a way station between leaving the womband going home. Monmouth 's NICU is that special place, providing care for some 500 infants ayear who are born prematurely or in dis - tress. Survival statistics in the 21- bassinet unit consistently exceednational averages, and the NICU reg - ularly places in the top 10 percent ofhospitals in avoiding complications. CHILDREN'S CRISIS INTERVENTION SERVICE This 19-bed inpatient facility serves patients ages 5 to 17, offeringpsychiatric services, nursing and social work attention. (If your child is in crisis, call the hotline at 732-923-6999.) PEDIA TRIC INTENSIVE CARE UNIT This is a six -bed unit that provides critical care for serious illnesses. A pediatric intensivist, or critical care physician, isalways available. The hospital hopes to undertak e a renovation of this facility soon, creating a new family area and a larger waiting room. CYSTIC FIBROSIS CENTER The only one of its kind in the area, this facility hasbeen led for more than two decades by pediatric pulmonologist Robert L. Zanni, M .D., a nationally recognized expert on this often life -shortening genetic condition. Dr . Zanni heads a team that also includes a respiratorytherapist, a nutritionist, a geneticist, asocial work er, a psychologist, a physicaltherapist and nurses. They guide regular care for some 75 children and adoles- cents with cystic fibrosis. Recognized by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation as a comprehensive care, teaching and re- search center , The Children's Hospital participates in clinical trials to advance progress against this disease. THE HERBER T POCH CENTER FOR DISOR- DERS OF INSULIN AND MET ABOLISM Here pediatric endocrinologist Malcolm S. Schwartz, D.O., chief of the division of pediatric endocrinology and diabetes, leads a team that battles today 's epi - demic of childhood obesity. He works with certifieddiabetes educators, dietitians, exercise physiologists, psychiatric social work ers and a psychologist. The goal is to use dietary changes, e xercise and weight loss to stave off the development of metabolic syndrome, or prediabetes. When diabetes does develop, this cen- ter guides young people in maintain - ing appropriate blood- sugar levels and avoiding complications. THE TOUCHPOINTS PROGRAM Research suggests that children fare best when parents are included in their medical care. The Children's Hospital at Monmouth Medical Center acts on this insight with a training program called T ouchpoints, which is based on a con cept pioneered by pediatrician and child development authority T . Berry Brazelton, M.D. Through role playing and discussion, clinicians sharpen their ability to forge helpful relationships with families. AND MORE . . .

Other key strengths of Monmouth's Children's Hospital MONMOUTH HEALTH &LIFE / 35 Anew technology that has been described as \"the future of radiation therapy\" is coming to Monmouth Medical Center this year. It's called T omoTherapy, and it's a nearly 360- degree computed tomography (CT) scanner thattakes images of a patient's anatomy and then shoots thousands of little radiation beamlets into the patientin varying directions and intensities to kill tumors\u2014and leave healthy tissue intact. \"T omoTherapy will allow us to get a high-quality CT image of the area that's going to be treated with radiation just seconds beforehand to make sure tar- geting is accurate,\" explains Mitchell W eiss, M.D., Monmouth 's chairman of radiation oncology , who is a former chief resident at Memorial Sloan-K ettering Cancer Center in New Y ork. A powerful computer controls radiation deliv - ery, and it can raise or lower the intensity of radiation delivered to different areas of tissue\u2014and block radi - ation entirely from reaching sensitive areas such as the spinal cord. The new system is likely to bring dramatic ben- efits to patients, says Dr. W eiss. It may reduce sideeffects and potentially permit higher doses of radia - tion to be used safely, thus improving outcomes. And it may mak e radiation treatment an option for patients who were not previously considered candi-dates, either because they'd received earlier radiation or because their tumors were considered too close to vital regions to radiate safely. While T omoTherapy is no cure-all, the upshot promises to be better out-comes for people with cancer. As Paul Reckwerdt, founder of T omoTherapy Inc., e xplains, radiation treatment many years ago was a crude process. \"Our bodies are like bowls of Jell-O,and tumors move around inside them,\" he says. \"Inthe old days, they 'd use radiation to blow a ' hole' in you large enough to be sure they got the tumor. Often that would also do a lot of collateral damage.\" In recent years, radiation delivery has becomeCOURTESY OF TOMOTHERAPY INCORPORATEDCONQUERING CANCERHEALTHlink more precise, and T omoTherapy is just one of a num- ber of technologies that advance that precision. Reckwerdt likens it to string art, the way hundreds of small strings converge to create shapes of different colors. In similar fashion, he says, the tiny radiation beamlets come together to raise radiation to tumor-killing levels where it counts. \"The ability to treat from so many different directions, with different levels of intensity , allows you to exquisitely outline the tumor and deliver treatment to multiple sites simultaneously ,\" says Reckwerdt. In a single piece of equipment, T omoTherapy combines the functions of treatment planning, patientpositioning and treatment delivery . A revolution in tumor imaging and treatment By rotating a thin beam around the body from many directions, TomoTherapy makes radiation more selective\u2014and more effective 36 / MAY 2007 For mor e infor mation about T omoTherapy at Monmouth Medical Center, call the Leon Hess Cancer Center's Institute for Advanced Radiation Oncology, 732-923-6890. \"The new system will allow us to treat almost any tumor\u2014and even target multiple lesions at once while preserving healthy tissue,\" says Dr. W eiss. During the session, the patient lies on a treat - ment table, and the T omoTherapy machine rotates around him or her almost a full 360 degrees\u2014it's not quite a full circle, the doctor says\u2014making it possi - ble to treat the malignant cells from nearly any angle. The device uses 3-D CT imaging to locatecancerous tissue, and the procedure tak es only 15 to 20 minutes each day. The CT scanning capabilities of T omo - Therapy , says Dr . Weiss, permit doctors to confirm information about the shape and position of thetumor before the radiation treatment begins. \"T omoTherapy lets us accurately treat tumors, even those with significant anatomical movement,\" the doctor explains. \"This is a breakthrough com- pared with previous methods of radiation delivery, which forced us to treat larger areas to account for tumor motion. And because we now have the abilityto target more precisely , we may be able to increase doses beyond what we've used in the past\u2014and get better cure rates.\" The TomoTherapy system combines the functions oftreatment planning, patient positioning and tr eatment deliver y. The result: better targeting of tumors. MALE WITCHHEALTHlink Everybody knows what it's like to feel down for a day or two. But when the mood lingers for weeksor months, it's time to talk to adoctor; you may be suffering fromdepression. In any given year, anestimated 20.9 million Americanadults, or about 9.5 percent of thepopulation, have a depressive ill- ness, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. \"T oday we understand that depression is a treatable disease,like pneumonia or diabetes,\" says Tess Medina, administrative direc- tor for behavioral health services at Monmouth Medical Center . Sometimes people who feel depressed hesitate to seek treat - ment because they attach a stigma to so-called mental illness, Medina notes. They should know that there's no shame in depression andthat it can be associated with a number of physical illnesses. And there's every likelihood that thesooner they seek help, the soonerthey 'll start feeling better . Common symptoms of de - pression include losing pleasure in things you used to enjoy, feelingsad or empty, crying easily or for noreason, fatigue and trouble con - centrating. Sleeping all the time and insomnia can both be sympto - matic of the illness, as can persis- tent physical problems such as headaches or stomach troubles. Though the manifestations of depression are fairly consistent, its causes are varied. Scientists theorize that genes play a part, as the condition often runs in fami-lies.

RECOGNIZING DEPRESSION IS THE FIRST STEP TO FEELING BETTERMIND AND SPIRIT appears to be a key factor in the development of depression. In some people, the level of thesechemicals may be too low or toohigh, predisposing them to the illness. Conditions such as stroke, heart attack , cancer, Parkinson's disease and hormonal disorders can also trigger depression, as can lifestressors such as the loss of a lovedone, divorce or financial strain. The main treatments include medication, stress management and psychotherapy, which involves ver- bal communication. Studies suggestthat moderate e xercise\u201430 minutes or more per day\u2014can ease symptoms of mild to moderate depression. But that should never be a substitute for checking with a physician to see if treatment is needed. Psychotherapy helps patients manage their thoughts, feelings andbehaviors. The process can bring them a greater understanding of old conflicts that may still be limitingthem and can teach them skills forliving a more satisfying life. Antidepressant medications, which help to restore the natural balance of brain chemicals, areoften very effective in relievingdepression. These drugs are non - addictive, and many newer agents have fewer side effects than earlierdrugs. Antidepressants tak e effect gradually, so it can be a few weeks before patients not-ice that a medication is working. If you 're having symptoms of depression, consult your doc- tor or call the hospital for a refer - ral. Says Medina: \"There are a number of ways we can help.\" Causes of depr essionAre you depressed? A diagnostic test 8signs that maymean depression If you, a friend or a r elative show these signs for two weeks or more, it's time to check with a doctor to find out if a clinical diagnosis of depression\u2014and appropriate treatment\u2014is required: 1. persistent feeling of sadness, hopelessness or anxiety 2. sense of wor thlessness 3. decreased interest in, and enjoyment of, activities and other people 4. dif ficulty concentrating, slow thinking or indecisiveness 5. loss of ener gy and motivation 6. change in appetite or sleep habits 7. persistent headaches or stomachaches not otherwise explained8. thoughts of death or suicide Sour ces: Monmouth Medical Center; National Institute of Mental HealthDepression can be triggered by negative experiences, but it can also strike when life seems objectively to be going well.

It 's also sometimes used for Barrett 's esophagus and high-grade dysplasia, conditions inwhich cells have been transformed into a precancerous condition by prolonged contact with stomach acids. The conventional procedure, using large, open cuts, has had a complication rate as high as 35 per - cent to 40 percent. But thanks to today's minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery and surgeons like FrankJ. Borao, M .D., of Monmouth Medical Center , the odds of coming through unscathed are much improved. Laparoscopic esophagectomy employs a small scope and tiny tools inserted through several smallincisions to allow access and visibility. For patients,this means less blood loss, decreased postoperativepain, fewer complications, faster healing and shorter hospital stays, averaging about a week , compared with the three weeks' stay usually required for open surgery . Dr. Borao did his first laparoscopic esophagec - tomy two years ago, and he's the only New Jersey sur- geon to have performed it. \"This is an e xtremely difficult procedure,\" says Michael A. Goldfarb, M.D., chairman of the depart- ment of surgery at Monmouth. \"Dr . Borao can do it because of his extensive background in other laparo- scopic operations. Y ou can't just decide to do this. It 's a progression after a surgeon masters the variations of gastric surgery.\" In laparoscopic esophagectomy , the diseased portion of the foodpipe is removedthrough small holes in the neck , chest and belly . Then the surgeon pulls the healthy tissue of the stomach higher up into theesophagus or neck and reconnects it. Pioneering two new operations on the esophagus These groundbreaking procedures can mean a quicker recovery for patientsSURGICAL STRIDESHEALTHlink 40 / MAY 2007The complex oper- ation can tak e from four to eight hours. The diffi- culty comes in part fromoperating in up to threedifferent body sections, increasing the possibility of running into prob - lems, Dr . Borao e xplains. \"There are only a handful of people in the country doing this totallylaparoscopically ,\" says Dr . Goldfarb, \"and Dr . Borao's rate of complications is much lower than the national average.\" Another k ey measure of success with this procedure is conversion rate, or howoften an operation begins laparoscopically but then must be converted to open surgery with cuts. Dr.Borao's is very low. \"W e are successful more than 90percent of the time in performing the operationusing a minimally invasive approach,\" he says. There's also the human element, of course. When patients have a high level of anxiety, Dr. Borao offers to put them in touch with other people who have undergone the procedure. \"This supportreally puts them at ease and gives them a new per - spective about what they should e xpect,\" he says. HOW ROBO TS PROVIDE A RISK-FREE ADVANCE By now, most of us understand that robotic surgery doesn 't mean an operation controlled by an independent, manlik e machine. Instead, robotic technology is a sophisti- cated tool that e xtends the surgeon 's reach and precision\u2014and depends on the surgeon 's own skill and savvy. Doctors at Monmouth Medical Cen - ter employ the new da Vinci S SurgicalSystem to perform a growing array of oper - Frank J. Borao, M.D.JEFF BURKE; PHOTOTAKE INC./ALAMY ations. The surgeon sits at a console in the operating room a few feet from the patient, turning knobs to control robotic arms that move lik e the human wrist. The machine eliminates the tiny hand tremors even the coolest surgeons have, and its three-dimensional imaging capacity can magnify visualization so that hand movements of several in- ches control much smaller motions within the patient. The result: great - er precision. While the equipment was first used for operations like prostatecto - my and hys - terectomy , the hospital has recently become a pio - neer in doing tho - racic surgery (operations in the chest cavity) roboti- cally as well. Last August, Monmouth thoracic surgeon Lourens J. Willekes II, M.D., became one of the first doc - tors in New Jersey to use robotic tech nology for an esophageal myotomy\u2014a procedure that divides themuscles of the esophagus. The operation is used to treat achalasia, a condition in which the inability of esopha-geal muscles to relax can make it impossible to swallow . \"The robotic technology gives us better visualizationand de xterity ,\" says Dr . Willekes. \"This approach will eventually be common prac - tice, but now it's cutting-edge.\"As he explains, esophageal myotomy is one of three kinds of tho-racic surgery that can be done roboti-cally . The others are lobectomy with lymph node dissection, in which a portion of the lung is removed to treatlung cancer, and mediastinal surgery,used to extract tumors in the centralchest area. Dr. Willekes did Monmouth's first robotic lobectomy last December . At presstime he was await- ing an appropriate patient for the first robotic medi- astinal procedure. Robotic thoracic surgery is an improvement on an improvement. A few years ago, the advent of aminimally invasive technique known as video-assisted thoracic surgery (V ATS) work ed a small revolution in these chest -cavity operations. Where the \"open \" pro- cedure known as thoracotomy required a major inci- sion in the chest and spreading ribs apart, VATS achieved the same results by introducing small, video - guided equipment through half -inch ports in the chest\u2014reducing recovery times from about four weeks to five to seven days. But VATS still requireddirect manipulation by the surgeon. Now , because robotic technology increases de x- terity , it e xtends the range of procedures that can be done in a minimally invasive fashion, making this dra- matically shorter recovery available to more patients.\"With VATS you're basically limited by operatingwith straight instruments of restricted de xterity ,\" says Dr. Willekes. \"The robotic arm is much more similar to the human wrist, so it lets us do some of the larger procedures that once required open surgery.\" Robotics also has the potential to let a surgeon operate from miles away, if\u2014and it's a big \"if\"\u2014someone at the bedside can position the robotic arms correctly . (While it wasn 't a thoracic procedure, the first transatlantic robotic \"telesurgery\" took place in 2001, when a surgeon sitting at a console in New Y ork removed the gallbladder of a patient in France.) But the real beauty of applying robotics to tho - racic surgery , says Dr . Willekes, is that it 's an innova- tion that doesn't add risk. The decision to \"go robot- ic\" can always be reversed if necessary . \"If I have to convert to V ATS or a thoracotomy , it doesn 't involve any e xtra incision,\" says the surgeon. \"W e haven't burned any bridges. W e're just reverting to a proce - dure that is still the standard of care.\" MONMOUTH HEALTH &LIFE / 41 Lourens J. Willekes II, M.D. Are you imagining things? Y our hospital bill is labeled \"outpatient,\" but you could have sworn you spent the night there. Don't worry . You're just affected by a relatively new wrinkle in Medicare billing policy that, lik e most such policies, has spread to private insurance payersas well. It's called \"outpatient observation\" status,and you may see it on your bill if you 've been in thehospital lately for a brief stay of up to 48 hours. By Medicare rules first promulgated back in 1992 but not seriously enforced in this area till 2005,observation status is the label given to hospital care for certain conditions\u2014nausea, dehydration, fainting spells, noncardiac chest pain and mini- strokes, or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), for e xample\u2014that require close watching but tend to be temporary . \"It's a lousy term,\" admits Alvin Fried, M.D., an internist who serves as physician adviser for care management and medical records at Monmouth Medical Center. That's because it may sound to some as if patients are only looked at rather than treated by physicians. A ctually , says Dr . Fried, \" from a treatment point of view , there's no difference between these patients and those who are fully admitted. It 's a label - ing distinction, not a medical care distinction. There's no compromise of patient care\u2014that's absolute.\" The purpose of the change in billing is to save money for Medicare\u2014and thus for the taxpayers, the doctor explains. Patients in outpatient observation status are billed as if they'd been treated in a physi-cian's office rather than in a hospital. That meansMedicare patients are billed under P art B for out - patient services rather than Part A for inpatient services. Last year , Monmouth treated 1,001 patients on an outpatient observation basis, compared with 20,500 conventional admissions, says Dr . Fried. The hospital created an Observation Unit in 2005, but observation patients actually can be placed anywherein the hospital. \"If you're an observation patient, the person in the bed ne xt to yours may be a full-admission patient, and you'll both receive the same nursing care,\" says Susan Sk ola, Monmouth's assistant vice president for patient care services, who stresses that \"Medicare is the driver behind this, not hospitals. And we're talk- ing about patients in a low -risk category .\" Finally , says Dr . Fried, it 's important to know that these labels \"aren 't written in stone\u2014they can be changed either way . If it 's found to be necessary , an observation patient can be immediately changed to full-admission status.\" HEALTHlinkBIG CHEESE PHOTO/JUPITER IMAGESMaking sense of a new category of care Does your hospital bill say 'outpatient observation'? Here's what that meansHOSPITAL WATCH 42 / MAY 2007 FACES OF MEDICINEJEFF BURKEWhat makes a dedicated doctor? For these three, seeing the difference they could make with patients was a key factor MITCHELL WEISS, M.D. \"It's amazing,\" says Mitchell W eiss, M.D., 36. \"Thanks to the way programming and equipmenthave improved, we can treatcancer patients with much lesstoxicity than they received 10 or 20 years ago\u2014and they're havingbetter outcomes too.\" Like many physicians, Dr. Weiss imagined himself in a lab coat from an early age\u2014but in his case it was originally aresearch investigator 's garb. Growing up in Highland Park, Illinois, with a podiatrist father and a schoolteacher mother,the math-and-science whiz knew he wanted a careerthat helped others. \"Theoretically youcould save more lives working in a lab,\" hesays. \"But I decided that was too imper- sonal. I wanted thedaily interaction that comes with being a doctor.\" At the University of Illinois he switched from bioengineering to biology to pre-med, and he earned an M.D. at the University of Chicago Medical School in 1998. Next came an internshipat Chicago's W eiss Memorial Hospital (no relation) and a resi- dency at New Y ork's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where he was chief resident. Hecame to Monmouth Medical Cen-ter in 2003, and in 2005 becamechairman of radiation oncology. Dr. W eiss and his wife, Jennifer, live in Ocean T ownship and have four children.JONATHAN TEITELBAUM, M.D. Call it the Mickey Mouse effect. Jonathan T eitelbaum, M.D., remembers the exact moment in his medical education when,already set on gastroenterology, he decided to focus on children. \"I was a third-year med student on rounds in the oncologyward\u2014these were very sickkids,\" he says. \"People came in dressed as Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse, and all the kidscame running out of the roomsto give them a big hug. And theattending physician turned to meand said, 'See? How could you notwant to go into pediatrics?' That was exactly how I felt. Kidsare more fun to deal with. They tend to bounce back.\" The Washington, D.C., native grew up on Long Island, where his father was a patent attorney and his mother an elementary -school teacher. As a highly allergic child he saw a lot of the allergist, which may have nudged him toward a medical career. An Emory University grad, he earned his M.D. at theUniversity of Pennsylvania Med- ical School in 1993. Then came a residency atChildren's Hospital of Philadelphia and a fellowship inpediatric gastro-enterology and nu-trition at both theChildren's Hospital of Boston and Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. T eitelbaum, 39, lives in Morganville with his wife,Michelle, and their two daughters.THOMAS HACKETT, D.O. It's a little-known that many gynecologic oncologists havenever practiced general obstet- rics and gynecology. But Thomas Hackett, D.O., 50, chose to doso when he spent a year in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and two years in Jacksonville, Florida, as a naval doctor. \"It was helpful for me to practice ob/gyn to learnwhat my patients go throughwhen they're healthy, and to see the profound impact the diagno - sis of a malignancy has on them,\" saysthe board-certifiedphysician. His interest in the field devel - oped during his residency in ob/gynat the Naval Medical Center in San Diego. For him, treating cancer patients was\u2014and is\u2014the perfect balance of technical challenge and satis- fying personal interaction. Prior to that, he attended medical school at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, School of Osteo- pathic Medicine. He went on to complete a fellowship in gyneco-logic oncology at P ennsylvania State University. Dr. Hackett's main clinical interest now is laparoscopic surgery with the use of robotics. When he is not working, he can often be found fly-fishing or creating in his woodworking shop at his Brielle home, which he shares with his wife, Robin, and three sons.
