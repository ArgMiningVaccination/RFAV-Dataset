Moderna, Pfizer, and Janssen vaccines are available for ages 12+; pediatric Pfizer vaccines available for children 5 - 11 years old. You can schedule a vaccine appointment online, by calling 412-321-4001 ext 278, or by email: [covid19vaccine@nschc.org](mailto:covid19vaccine@nschc.org.?subject=COVID%20Vaccination&cc=acarter%40nschc.org). Patients can also receive a vaccine at the time of their medical, dental, or behavioral health appointment. Vaccines are available at no cost to any individual regardless of whether or not you have insurance. You do not need to be a patient of NSCHC to schedule the appointment! All vaccines are safe and effective, particularly against severe illness and death from COVID-19. The CDC recommends all individuals get whatever vaccine is available to them as soon as they are eligible. CDC does not recommend one vaccine over another. HOW WERE THE VACCINES DEVELOPED SO QUICKLY? Large scale funding was available to help develop and manufacture vaccines. Widespread disease allowed vaccine efficacy and safety to be studied in real-time, and large numbers of people volunteered to be part of the clinical trials. Two COVID vaccines have been authorized for use by the FDA: one from Pfizer and one from Moderna. Both are mRNA vaccines. The Pfizer vaccine is a 2 dose series, spaced 21 days apart, authorized for individuals age 16 and up. The Moderna vaccine is a 2 dose series, spaced 28 days apart, authorized for those 18 years and older. These vaccines have been studied extensively and are safe and effective against the COVID-19 virus. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been held to the same safety and efficacy standards as all other vaccines in the U.S. This includes multi-phased trials involving tens of thousands of individuals. For example, the Moderna trial included 30,000 adults of various ages, races, and ethnicities. WHAT IS AN MRNA VACCINE, AND HOW DOES IT WORK? mRNA vaccines contain mRNA that acts as an instruction manual for our cells. Once injected, the mRNA enters our cells and directs our cells to make a harmless piece of protein from the COVID-19 virus. The mRNA is then broken down and discarded. Next, our cells display the protein piece on their outer surfaces. Our immune system recognizes the foreign protein, mounts an immune response, makes antibodies, and ultimately learns how to protect us against infection from the actual virus. mRNA vaccines do not contain COVID-19 virus and cannot make you sick or give you COVID-19. The mRNA does not alter or interact with our DNA in any way. ARE THE VACCINES SAFE? ARE THERE SIDE EFFECTS? Yes! Tens of thousands of people were vaccinated in clinical trials with no significant safety concerns. At least 8 weeks of safety data was gathered after vaccination- it would be very unusual for side effects to occur more than 8 weeks after an injection. The FDA and CDC will continue to closely monitor vaccine safety and side effects as they do with all other vaccines. Side effects are expected with any vaccine and are a sign your immune system is responding. They typically go away in a few days and include pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site, fever, chills, fatigue, headache. IS THE VACCINE EFFECTIVE? Yes, studies to-date indicate both vaccines have an efficacy rate of 94-95 percent. In vaccine trials, participants are divided randomly into two groups. Each group receives an injection- one containing the actual vaccine, while the other gets a placebo (a harmless injection that does not contain active vaccine ingredients). Neither scientists, nor participants know who is getting which kind of injection so as not to bias, or affect the results. After the injections are given, scientists wait to identify individuals who develop symptoms and test positive for COVID-19. They then compare how many infected participants received the actual vaccine versus the placebo. In the Pfizer trial, 170 people tested positive for COVID-19. Out of these 170, 162 had received the placebo, and just 8 had received the actual vaccine. "}
