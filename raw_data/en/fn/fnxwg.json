However, if the products were available, which pharmacists would be able to deliver shots? The National Alliance of State Pharmacy Associations recently [updated]( https://naspa.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Pharmacist-Immunization-Authority-August-2022.pdf) its information on pharmacist immunization authority to answer that question. Its analysis of state pharmacy regulations suggests that pharmacists can prescribe the vaccine or administer the vaccine via a prescriber-approved protocol or nonpatient-specific order in 37 states. Other limitations exist in eight states. In Georgia, Indiana, and Iowa, pharmacists can administer the vaccine with a prescription OR via protocol if the state declares a public health emergency. A prescription is required in every circumstance in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Utah. In New York, the Commissioner of Health must determine a need in the state and issues a standing order. In Massachusetts, a patient-specific collaborative practice agreement is required. Pharmacists are not currently allowed to administer monkeypox vaccines in Wyoming, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Maryland, and the District of Columbia. At least eight states call for various changes in pharmacist immunization authority during a state-declared public health emergency. Those include Iowa, New York, Oregon, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, and Indiana. Earlier this month, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) [asked](https://www.ashp.org/-/media/assets/advocacy-issues/docs/HHS-Letter-Monkeypox.pdf) federal health officials to take an additional step to ensure that those who need the monkeypox vaccination can get it by allowing pharmacists to order and administer the vaccines. That was spelled out in a letter to Xavier Becerra, secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services. Tom Kraus, JD, VP Government Relations for the ASHP, pointed out, \"Pharmacists are well positioned to administer monkeypox vaccines for pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis of healthcare workers, patients, their close contacts, and populations at risk for severe disease from monkeypox virus (such as people with HIV or other immunocompromising conditions).\" The content contained in this article is for informational purposes only.
