Summary In 1998, Andrew Wakefield and colleagues published an article in this journal called Lancet. Wakefield's theory was that this measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine had the series of outcomes that allow intestinal arousal, entry into the blood of proteins toxic to the brain, and consequent development of autism. In supporting of his theory, Dr. Wakefield identified 12 kids with developmental delay \u2014 eight had syndrome. All of these kids got intestinal charges and produced autism within one month of getting MMR (Park, Alice 1). The fake news (misinformation) from this is that vaccines causes autism. At the time, fear about autism and MMR vaccine had also started to change. As information mounted that MMR vaccine was not linked with autism, some autism benefit groups changed their theory from MMR vaccine to the idea that thimerosal was getting syndrome in babies. The concept was based upon observed similarities in some characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD ) and metal intoxication. "}
