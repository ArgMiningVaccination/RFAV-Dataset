With time, this cycle becomes the \"new normal\" for them. It's all they know, and they become accustomed to it, so much so that positive change may feel strange, novel, and even unwanted at times. You may feel unworthy or undeserving of the happiness and healing that comes your way. Make sure you realize your self-worth and feel open and ready to embrace and accept positive change with open arms. Ready to get started?
