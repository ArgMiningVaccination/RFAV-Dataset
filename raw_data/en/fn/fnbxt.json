Program 2014 Annual Report Dean's Message Robert N . Golden, MD Dean, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public HealthVice Chancellor for Medical Affairs, UW-MadisonOn behalf of the UW School of Medicine and Public Health, I am pleased to present the 2014 Annual Report of the Wisconsin Partnership Program . This wonderful endowment, created in 2004 when Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wisconsin converted to a stock insurance corporation, provides resources that enable the school, in partnership with communities across the state, to tackle some of our most challenging health issues . As an exemplar of the Wisconsin Idea, the Wisconsin Partnership Program reaches far beyond classrooms and research laboratories in support of the school's missions . Community-academic partnerships, research projects, innovative educational programs and community service projects funded by the Wisconsin Partnership Program have a common goal: improving the health of the people and communities in our state . This is an ambitious goal, not easily achieved . The Partnership Program can help communities address health priorities, but success depends largely on local leadership and a shared focus on \"the long game,\" rather than immediate results . For the really tough, important issues, we can't expect to simply flick on a light switch . Instead, we must be prepared to do the hard work of installing the wiring and fixtures, placing the correct light bulbs, and then gradually turning on the rheostats . Support from the Partnership Program also allows faculty to work with communities and to advance ground-breaking research, including pilot projects that when successful can compete for outside funding . The Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (ICTR), for example, has brought more than $81 million in additional funding to our state since its first award from the Partnership Program . The Wisconsin Partnership Program's 2014-2019 Five-Year Plan outlines a new direction for addressing complex health issues that is based on a body of research showing that sustained change is more likely to occur when a broad coalition of organizations and individuals collectively focus on a common agenda . The Wisconsin Obesity Prevention Initiative, which the Partnership Program established in 2014, reflects this shift from funding single organizations working independently to investing in longer-term, structured and comprehensive programs that address complex health issues . The Wisconsin Partnership Program provides an extraordinary opportunity for bridging the expertise of community organizations with that of the university to benefit communities across the state . Together, in partnership, we can make a difference in the lives of the people of Wisconsin . Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report 1Sharpening the Focus Entering its second decade of improving health, the Wisconsin Partnership Program launched a new era in 2014, when implementation of the 2014-2019 Five-Year Plan began . This strategic plan looks at the Partnership Program's priorities through a new lens - with the goal of making Wisconsin a healthier state for all through investments in research, education and community partnerships .Developed with guidance from key stakeholders throughout Wisconsin, the Five-Year Plan emphasizes a deeper focus on impact, collaboration, sustainability, dissemination, and policy, systems and environmental change . This emphasis aligns with a growing realization among funders nationwide about how to strategically and effectively address large-scale health issues . Grants Awarded by Type 2004-2014 Basic Science and Research $10.9 million Clinical and Translational Research $41.4 million Public Health Education and Training $23.9 million Public Health $77.9 million 27%7% 50%16% Grants Awarded 2004-2014 376 grants = $154.2 million Grants Awarded 2014 24 grants = $19.5 million Right: Dr. Miriam Shelef, assistant professor of rheumatology, received a New Investigator Program grant in 2014 to study how genetic variants associated with arthritis cause disease. 2 Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report Partnering with Communities to Improve Health During 2014, the Oversight and Advisory Committee (OAC) focused its efforts on finalizing strategies for implementing the 2014-2019 Five-Year Plan . Learning from university, state and national experts about best practices and national trends, OAC members carefully considered new funding mechanisms . For example, the OAC created the Community Opportunity Grants Program, which provides support to jump start implementation and evaluation efforts through community health improvement plans and needs assessments . This new grant program seeks to enhance collaboration among public health departments, nonprofit organizations, hospitals, clinics, health care systems, schools, businesses and government leaders on community-identified health priorities . To strengthen the Partnership Program's commitment to Wisconsin's most pressing public health priorities, the OAC also focused on implementing the Community Impact Grants Program, which supports large-scale, evidence-based initiatives requiring substantial community engagement and well-established leadership . The OAC will launch the new grant programs in 2015 .Community Grants Awarded in 2014 Title Community Organization, Academic PartnerType Amount Duration Beloit LIHF Collaborative Community Health Systems-Beloit Area Community Health CenterLIHF $150,000 1 year Healthy Wisconsin Leadership Institute Karen Timberlake, JD, Department of Population Health Sciences, UW School of Medicine and Public HealthStrategic $1,187,261 5 years Kenosha LIHF Kenosha County Division of Health LIHF $750,000 5 years Lifecourse Initiative for Healthy Families EvaluationDeborah Ehrenthal, MD, MPH, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, UW School of Medicine and Public HealthStrategic $692,025 4 years, 3 months Lifecourse Initiative for Healthy Families Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring SystemNora Cate Schaeffer, PhD, UW Survey CenterLIHF $223,905 1 year, 3 months Lifecourse Initiative for Healthy Families Regional Program OfficeRon Cisler, PhD, Department of Population Health Sciences, UW School of Medicine and Public HealthStrategic $1,294,972 4 years, 9 months Phase One: Building Community- Engaged, Collective Impact with Multi-setting Interventions in Two Wisconsin CountiesMarathon County Health Department; Menominee County; Brian Christens, PhD, School Human Ecology, UW-MadisonStrategic $1,140,000 3 years Racine LIHF Collaborative Racine Kenosha Community Action AgencyLIHF $1,000,000 5 years Wisconsin Population Health Service FellowshipThomas Oliver, PhD, MHA, Department of Population Health Sciences, UW School of Medicine and Public HealthStrategic $875,460 3 years LIHF = Lifecourse Initiative for Healthy Families Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report 3Community Grants Concluded in 2014 Title Community Organization, Academic Partner TypeAmount ExpendedDuration Beloit Lifecourse Initiative for Families LIHF $230,882 2 years, 2 months CESA #9 Active & Healthy Schools Cooperative Educational Service Agency #9; Aaron Carrel, MD, Department of Pediatrics, UW School of Medicine and Public HealthCAPF $47,143 1 year, 2 months Community-based EMS Pilot Project Northeast Wisconsin Technical College; Robert Jecklin, PhD, MPH, Department of Health Education and Health Promotion, UW-La CrosseCAPF $14,388 1 year, 6 months Development of a Curriculum to Support Healthy Bites, A Wisconsin Guide for Improving Childhood NutritionCelebrate Children Foundation; Tara LaRowe, PhD, Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, UW School of Medicine and Public HealthCAPF $49,983 1 year Dismantling Racism in Kenosha County Kenosha County Division of Health; Markus Brauer, PhD, Department of Psychology, UW-MadisonLIHF $34,874 1 year Engaging African-American Fathers to Reduce Infant Mortality by Improving their Health LiteracyIMPACT Alcohol & Other Drug Abuse Services, Inc .

Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report 5Building Local Leadership for Public Health Communities across the state are tackling a host of challenging health issues, including childhood obesity, mental health, substance abuse and health inequities . No matter their size or structure, these communities - and the people who live there - reap the benefits of the Wisconsin Partnership Program . A prime example of the Partnership Program's support to communities is illustrated through the work of the Healthy Wisconsin Leadership Institute, which builds strong local leadership to improve public health . \"Community members and health leaders develop skills and gain experience to address local health needs,\" said Karen Timberlake, JD, director of the Population Health Institute at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health and faculty director for the Leadership Institute . \"Public health leaders and local residents are tremendous allies with physicians and other professionals for improving communities' health throughout Wisconsin .\" In 2014, the Partnership Program's Oversight and Advisory Committee renewed funding for the Leadership Institute . The five-year grant emphasizes tailored technical assistance for Partnership Program community grantees, regional health improvement capacity and continuous program evaluation and improvement . 6 Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report To increase shared learning across communities and reduce time and distance barriers, the Healthy Wisconsin Leadership Institute's Community Teams and COACH programs are offered regionally . Building on its experience working with community teams, the Leadership Institute began offering regional training in 2014 and created a dual track to recognize communities' differing stages of readiness . The Regional Community Teams program facilitates sustainable partnerships by developing collaborative leadership and public health skills among participants . Community Teams alumni have the opportunity to participate in the COACH (collaborating, organizing and advocating for community health) program, which offers three years of support to strengthen skills for implementing policy, systems and environmental changes that improve health in Wisconsin . The regional model promotes cross-community learning and shared vision for collective impact related to the social determinants of health . Both programs began with the Southeastern Region in 2014 . 2014-2015 Regional Community Teams East Central Health in Planning Team: Incorporating health into regional planning processes South Central Wisconsin Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming Team: Improving health among transgender and gender non-conforming communities Transforming Wisconsin Food Systems Leadership Team: Increasing access to and consumption of healthy, local food (Brown, Kenosha, Manitowoc, Marathon, Winnebago and Wood counties) Wisconsin Minority Health Leadership Team: Improving mental health and alcohol and other drug abuse outcomes for minority populations in Wisconsin (statewide) Oconomowoc Health & Wellness Alliance: Using collective impact to enhance overall health and wellness in Oconomowoc (Waukesha County)2014-2017 COACH Teams Fort Healthcare Healthy Communities Coalition: Using collective impact to increase access to physical activity and healthy food in Fort Atkinson Healthy People Project of Washington County: Improving health by increasing awareness and access to healthy food choices and by increasing and promoting opportunities for physical activity LIFE (Lifestyle Initiative for Fitness Empowerment) Foundation: Improving nutrition and increasing physical activity in local, safe environments in Cross Plains Wisconsin Active Communities Alliance (WACA): Increasing opportunities for neighborhoods, cities and counties to build physical activity into the daily routine of their residents Working for Whitewater's Wellness (W3): Increasing physical activity, healthy eating, social connectedness and positive outlook to improve wellness \"Our team has gained knowledge, skills and tools that make our work more effective and efficient. The Leadership Institute also has strengthened relationships within our multidisciplinary team, which has resulted in greater collective impact for our region.\" -Tom Baron, East Central Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report 7Serving Communities, Connecting Campus The Wisconsin Population Health Service Fellowship program exemplifies the many successes of the Wisconsin Partnership Program at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) . In collaboration with local and state health departments and community organizations, the program extends the school's reach beyond campus to improve the health of Wisconsin residents . \"This program strengthens the ties between the people of Wisconsin and the School of Medicine and Public Health,\" said Thomas Oliver, PhD, MHA, professor of population health sciences and faculty director of the fellowship program . \"It provides invaluable service to communities across the state and offers tremendous opportunities for fellows to build their knowledge and skills as future public health professionals .\" The two-year program places early-career public health professionals in local communities to address a wide range of challenging health issues . More than 30 local and state health departments and community organizations in Eau Claire, La Crosse, Lac du Flambeau, Madison, Menominee, Milwaukee, Sauk City and Shawano have benefitted from the contributions of 50 fellows since the program began in 2004 . Left: After completing her fellowship, Traici Brockman stayed in Wisconsin to help bring health care providers to communities in need. 8 Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report More than of Population Health Service Fellows remain employed in public health initiatives in Wisconsin. Joint Funding Supports Population Health Service Fellowship In 2014, the Oversight and Advisory Committee and the Partnership Education and Research Committee provided renewal funding for the Population Health Service Fellowship . The three-year grant incorporates an increased focus on integrating medical and population health training on and off the UW-Madison campus . The program combines community service with workforce development to: build the next generation of public health leaders skilled in planning, implementing and evaluating innovative strategies for public health improvement . provide direct service to community partners to address Wisconsin's most pressing public health challenges . 54% Fellows expand their knowledge and skills with guidance from on-site mentors who assist with achieving targeted objectives and through monthly meetings with other fellows and public health leaders . They also participate in core activities of learning, which strengthen their experience . \"The benefit is so great for rural areas where we don't have as many resources at our fingertips,\" said Jaime Bodden, MPH, health officer and director for Shawano County . \"It's a great experience for the fellow and for the hosting site .\" Bodden served as a mentor for Lauren Lamers, MPH, who completed her fellowship in June 2015 . \"Lauren did some amazing work for Shawano County and the Menominee Tribal Clinic,\" Bodden said . \"She was instrumental in developing a public health data clearinghouse that is easy for anyone on our staff to use . It was a blessing to have such a talented epidemiologist with us for two years . She left a lasting legacy .\" After completing the program, most fellows remain in Wisconsin serving local communities in public health leadership positions . Benjamen Jones, MPH, Waukesha County's health officer since 2013, was one of the first Population Health Service Fellows . Having grown up in Mukwonago, Jones now works in a community he calls home . According to Jones, the fellowship afforded him opportunities he would not have otherwise had . \"I directly credit that to the fellowship and the Milwaukee Health Department creating that experience for me,\" he said . Traici Brockman, MPH, a fellow in the state Division of Public Health from 2007 to 2009, agrees . \"As a fellow, I came in at a certain level of respect that allowed me to grow and blossom,\" said Brockman . \"I was able to contribute immediately and constantly build on what I was learning on the job and through the monthly learning sessions with other fellows .\" After completing her fellowship, Brockman joined the Primary Care Office at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, where she works closely with counties and communities designated as medically underserved and/or health care professional shortage areas . \"During my fellowship, I learned the critical importance of good relationships with local public health officials and other health professionals,\" she said . \"That lesson has served me well .\" Brockman's other responsibilities include federal scholarship and loan repayment programs for medical students and physicians and the J-1 Visa Waiver Program . \"These programs help get people the health care they need,\" she said . \"It's very rewarding work .\" Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report 9Improving Health through Research and Education Through its Partnership Education and Research Committee (PERC), the Wisconsin Partnership Program supports a remarkable breadth of initiatives, selecting those with the greatest potential impact on the health of Wisconsin residents . PERC grants aim to address issues of health and health care in a continuum that spans basic, clinical, translational and applied public health research as well as education and training . In 2014, the PERC awarded 15 grants, including five through the New Investigator Program and four through the Collaborative Health Sciences Program . New Investigator and Collaborative Health Sciences grants support project initiation with the anticipation that sustainability will depend on competitive extramural support for research .

To ensure consistency and continuity for reviews, the PERC in 2014 created a Review Subcommittee with two public representatives, who bring a community perspective to the committee's deliberations . The New Investigator Program supports early- career faculty at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health who are initiating pilot projects that, if successful, can lead to additional support from federal and other granting agencies . Since 2005, the Partnership Program has awarded more than $5 .2 million through the New Investigator Program . The Collaborative Health Sciences Program (CHSP) provides established researchers with funds for interdisciplinary projects that address childhood asthma, Alzheimer's disease and other compelling health issues . Since 2007, the Partnership Program has awarded more than $9 .6 million through the Collaborative Health Sciences Program . Several New Investigator grants also have led to CHSP awards . For example, Xin Sun, PhD, received a New Investigator grant in 2005 to study the molecular and genetic mechanisms involved in lung formation and lung diseases . In 2014, she built on this basic science research to earn a CHSP grant for identifying the genomic variations that contribute to the development of asthma . The goal of this interdisciplinary grant is to develop diagnosis tools that enable personalized treatments for children . During 2014, the PERC made its second award through the Opportunity Grants Program . This new program provided rapid-response funding for the successful efforts of Nancy Pandhi, MD, PhD, MPH, to have UW-Madison recognized as the lead institution in the United States for work employing the Database of Individual Patient Experience (DIPeX) methodology created at Oxford University . As a means of providing reliable information about patients' and caregivers' direct experiences with illness and health care, DIPeX is highly regarded internationally and has been adopted by nine other countries . Dr . Pandhi's module will focus on young adults with depression-a vulnerable group in high need of relevant, accessible information . As outlined in the 2014-2019 Five-Year Plan, the PERC is expanding its collaboration with the Oversight and Advisory Committee . Examples include the jointly funded Population Health Service Fellowship, Lifecourse Initiative for Healthy Families and Wisconsin Obesity Prevention Initiative .

Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report 13Understanding Polyploid Breast Cancers to Personalize Treatment As a physician scientist, Mark Burkard, MD, PhD, keeps his patients front and center while working in his research lab . \"It's all about them,\" he said . \"They drive my research .\" The New Investigator Program (NIP) grant he received from the Wisconsin Partnership Program in 2011 has given him hope for additional funding that directly affects his patients . Dr . Burkard's focus on cell biology has allowed him to secure several basic science grants . Yet, clinical and translational grants - those that could benefit his patients - have eluded him because he lacks the data necessary to receive funding from the National Institutes of Health and other granting organizations . He's hoping his research through the NIP is a game-changer . \"This grant program has allowed me to develop a major component of my research that makes me more competitive for larger grants,\" said Dr . Burkard, a medical oncologist Brittany Zachek examined the distinct behaviors of polyploid breast cancer cells. 14 Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report Grant Supports Multidisciplinary Cancer Research Less than two years after receiving his first grant from the Wisconsin Partnership Program, Mark Burkard, MD, PhD, was given another opportunity to make a difference in the lives of women with breast cancer . Dr . Burkard, a physician researcher, was chatting with biomedical engineer David Beebe, PhD - a \"neighbor\" at the UW Carbone Cancer Center - about the difficulty predicting which women will benefit from which treatment . \"We talked about making a device that would help us identify in each person which drug would be effective,\" Dr . Burkard said . \"A Collaborative Health Sciences grant from the Partnership Program is allowing us to more fully develop that idea .\" Lee Wilke, MD, FACS, leads the multidisciplinary team of researchers that received a $500,000 grant in 2013 for their project, Multiplexed In Vivo Device to Assess Optimal Breast Cancer Therapy . The device would allow simultaneous testing of small amounts of multiple drugs within a tumor's discrete regions . By establishing the efficacy of each drug within the same cancer, the researchers hope to accelerate the process of personalized cancer therapy . \"That's an opportunity created by this cancer center being part of an integrated university,\" said Dr . Burkard, a co-principal investigator on the project with Dr . Beebe .Dr . Burkard's NIP-funded research focused on polyploid breast cancer - those with cells having extra chromosomes . \"The biggest takeaway was that a set of breast cancers with too many chromosomes seems to correlate with worse outcomes,\" he said . By identifying this subset of breast cancer, Dr . Burkard and others in his lab also learned the distinct behaviors of these cells . In the current clinical hierarchy, there are three major types of breast cancers: estrogen or hormone sensitive, HER2 and triple negative . Polyploid breast cancer crosses all three types, but it is a little more preponderant in triple-negative breast cancer, \"kind of an . Burkard said . Physicians generally can't predict which cancer treatment will work for which person . \"We typically say 'this drug works for a certain percent of people,' but in the future we hope to predict what will work for an individual patient,\" Dr . Burkard said . Dr . Burkard and others in his lab analyzed data for 40,000 chemicals to determine which would block the growth of cancer cells with the most chromosomes . \"We found that about 30 correlated pretty well,\" he said . After additional tests, they discovered that one chemical destroyed abnormal cells without affecting normal cells - a potential low- toxicity treatment for a high-risk breast cancer type . \"Part of the discovery process is partitioning different types of cancer and using that to predict which drugs are going to work for which person,\" he said . \"Once you do that, you might discover that 'oh, my . This drug that we've been using for 30 years, we never knew why it works only on these people . But we now know the reason' .\" The New Investigator Program supports assistant professors in expanding their research interests into new areas and in moving research from the laboratory to the bedside and into communities.

Her interest in the broader issues that affect health deepened when she entered the UW School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) in 2013 . \"The science of medicine has always interested me, but as a medical student, I wanted a program that focused on the social and human aspects of medicine,\" said Masoom . \"The UW was a perfect fit .\" Masoom has immersed herself in the Integrative Cases experiences required of all first- and second-year medical students at the SMPH . Introduced in 2008, the Integrative Cases exemplify the medical school's transformation into the nation's first school that truly combines medicine and public health, which the Wisconsin Partnership Program has supported since 2005 . Through small-group activities and faculty-led discussions, students discover the many factors that influence health and well-being, the interconnections between those factors and the physician's role in promoting health and well-being for individuals and populations that extend beyond traditional clinical care . Students examine the public health, social, ethical, economic and legal issues that affect health and health care . Left: Jasmine Wiley participates in an Integrative Cases activity during her first year of medical school. 16 Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report Above: During one of the Integrative Cases, students practiced testifying at a mock hearing on health policy issues at the state Capitol in Madison. Below: Second-year medical students discuss insurance coverage at their Cost-of-care Integrative Case. During the two-day activity, they learn about costs and charges for care and drivers of health care costs, such as technology, utilization, and patient behavior and characteristics. \"Our goal is to help shape physicians who understand the world beyond the exam room, to show them how that world shapes the health of their patients,\" said Christine Seibert, MD, associate dean for medical student education and services . The activities take students into the community, where they learn from first responders, advocacy groups, legal experts, lawmakers, reporters and other resources that traditionally have had little or no role in medical education, especially in the preclinical years . Faculty and staff from across the UW-Madison campus (College of Engineering, Law School, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, etc .) also share their expertise . \"We are tapping such incredible, often overlooked, people who have so much to teach our students,\" said Renie Schapiro, Integrative Cases director . \"These are people who medical students may not experience during the traditional curriculum .\" Clinical faculty members also enjoy participating . \"They bring their experience to a wide-ranging, primarily student-driven discussion - something they don't normally do,\" Schapiro said . That enthusiasm is evident to the students . \"It has been amazing to meet so many faculty who have expertise in different areas,\" Masoom said . \"From a professional development standpoint, it helps me see the many things that physicians can do beyond seeing patients . It has been outstanding to see how they give back to the community .\" First-year medical students have four cases, and second-year students have two more advanced cases . Each lasts a day and a half to two days . The current first-year cases focus on determinants of health, poverty, drunken driving and health policy; and the second-year cases address health policy advocacy and cost-of-care . \"Every case adds a dimension to our careers as future medical professionals that we wouldn't otherwise have in the classroom,\" said Masoom . For example, students followed a young driver from an episode of drunken driving through her car crash, trauma treatment and long-term rehabilitative care needs . Students visited a community hospital and a level-one trauma center, and they met with law enforcement personnel, state transportation officials and lawmakers about reducing drunken driving . \"Unlike other classes, there is no exam at the end of the Integrative Cases,\" said Schapiro . \"What drives learning is interest and engagement . We ask students to explore these issues and think broadly .\" Since 2008, the cases have evolved; some having minor updates and others being introduced to meet student needs . Feedback from students and guidance from a 10-member student advisory board help shape the Integrative Cases . \"It is very rewarding that we can bring ideas to the people designing our programs and see them implemented,\" said Masoom, who was selected for the advisory board shortly after her first Integrative Case . \"It shows that the administration cares about what we think, and they take our opinions to heart .\" Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report 17Researchers Come Together through Collaborative Grant Program Decades ago, state health leaders had the foresight to require health professionals to report blastomycosis, an uncommon but potentially serious illness, to public health officials . This rich clinical data provides especially valuable information for Bruce Klein, MD, and his colleagues studying a possible genetic link between the disease and people of Hmong ethnicity . \"Some people exposed to the soil fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis can develop an overwhelming respiratory infection and die in a matter of days,\" said Caitlin Pepperell, MD, an assistant professor of medicine at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health . \"I've always been curious as to why it happens to some people and not others . I thought there must be a human genetic basis that alters the outcome of the infection .\" Dr . Klein, a professor of pediatrics, and Dr . Pepperell are the lead investigators for a 2014 Collaborative Health Sciences Program grant from the Wisconsin Partnership Program . Other members of the team include Jeffrey Davis, MD, Wisconsin Division of Health; Igor Slukvin, MD, PhD, Department of Left: At an Asian market in Wausau, Donny Xiong posts information about a study investigating a possible genetic link between blastomycosis and people of Hmong ethnicity. 18 Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report Pathology and Laboratory Medicine; and Christina Kendziorski, PhD, Department of Biostatistics and Medical Informatics . \"The intent of the funding mechanism is to stimulate people with unique skill sets to come together to tackle what is perceived as an important health problem,\" Dr . Klein said . \"This is such a unique and powerful opportunity to understand the general principles of how patients fight infection and mobilize immunity and inflammation in a helpful or harmful way . And the knowledge gained should benefit Hmong people .\" Dr . Klein has been studying blastomycosis since 1981, when the U .S . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assigned him as an Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) Officer with the Wisconsin Division of Health . He joined the UW-Madison faculty in 1988, and Dr . Pepperell came in 2011 . \"I've wondered whether the possible genetic predisposition to blastomycosis was rooted in some aberrant immune response to the fungus,\" Dr . Klein said . \"I didn't know exactly how to approach this kind of genetic issue, when into my door for a job interview walks Caitlin Pepperell, who had the absolute perfect expertise in genome science and bioinformatics to collaborate on this question and offered a skill set that I didn't have .\" Dr . Pepperell, a native of Canada who specializes in tuberculosis, has a personal connection to blastomycosis - several family members and friends have been infected, and a family dog died from it . Unlike tuberculosis, blastomycosis is caused by a fungus . And very few fungi are pathogens in mammals .\"Out of the enormous diversity of over 100,000 species of fungi on our planet, only a very small fraction cause disease in mammals, and Blastomyces is one of them,\" said Dr . Pepperell, who arrived in Wisconsin a year after the state experienced the largest blastomycosis outbreak on record . From 2009 to 2010, Marathon County in central Wisconsin reported 55 cases of blastomycosis, 45 percent of which were people of Hmong ethnicity . This made sense to Dr . Klein and other researchers because blastomycosis is a soil fungus, and there are high numbers of Hmong people in the area who come into contact with soil . \"However, the investigation did not identify gardening or other activities that would have explained that unique excess risk,\" Dr . Klein said . \"We were left wondering if their ethnicity and some genetic predisposition were at the root of their susceptibility .\" Shortly after joining the UW-Madison faculty, Dr . Pepperell received a Department of Medicine grant to study six Hmong people diagnosed with blastomycosis during the 2009-2010 outbreak . This pilot project led to her identification of a collection of candidate genes that might regulate fungal immunity . Some of these genes were coincidently similar to immune response genes Dr . Klein's lab was studying as uniquely recognizing fungi . \"We were collecting data completely in parallel, unbeknownst to one another,\" Dr . Klein said . At the same time, Dr . Pepperell was recruiting people to help with a tuberculosis project . \"One of the resumes that came across my desk was from Donny Xiong,\" she said . His resume mentioned the Hmong American Student Association at UW-Madison . \"It was a confluence of amazing opportunity,\" Dr . Pepperell said, noting that researchers are seeking to identify better ways of linking people in the Hmong community with health services . \"Over time, Donny and I wrote a paper about Hmong people's perceptions about genetics and how open they were to participating in this type of research .\" Many of the people they spoke with had friends and family affected by blastomycosis . \"They were very willing, generous and interested in having research done in this area,\" Dr . Pepperell said . \"As long as you explain why you're doing it and you're clear in your communication, it's an eminently doable thing . Our hope in the long term is that better education about the disease will diminish the risk of infection or the severity of illness through early detection in this susceptible population .\" Sporulating mold (left) and yeast form cells (right) of Blastomyces dermatitidis. Scale bar, 10 microns. Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report 19Addressing Complex Issues By their nature, some of the most alarming health issues are extremely complex . High-quality health care is critical, but social, economic, environmental and many other factors contribute significantly to health, well-being and health equity . The Wisconsin Partnership Program's 2014-2019 Five-Year Plan acknowledges this by emphasizing a collective focus on the state's most pressing health issues, including childhood obesity . Numerous community organizations and government entities in the state - including several funded by the Partnership Program - have made progress on certain aspects of obesity, alcohol and drug abuse, cancer, infant mortality, smoking cessation and other challenging health issues . However, research has shown that sustained change is more likely to occur when organizations and individuals collectively focus on a common set of goals with mutually reinforcing activities . Stakeholders also must recognize that improvement will be gradual because impact on complex issues requires constant evaluation and altering approaches as barriers are faced and addressed . Meaningful, lasting success takes time . Like other grant-making organizations across the country, the Partnership Program embraces this new paradigm - known as collective impact - for addressing complex social issues . The UW School of Medicine and Public Health and community partners throughout the state are joining forces through the Wisconsin Obesity Prevention Initiative using collective impact strategies, and the Lifecourse Initiative for Healthy Families is broadly employing them as communities in southeast Wisconsin seek to improve birth outcomes among African-American families . Collective impact - the commitment of a group of important actors from different sectors to a common agenda for solving a specific social problem.The Five Conditions of Collective Success Common agenda Shared measurement systems Mutually reinforcing activities Continuous communication Backbone support organization - John Kania and Mark Kramer, Stanford Social Innovation Review, Winter 2011 20 Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report Joint Funding Supports Obesity Initiative Launched in 2014, the Wisconsin Obesity Prevention Initiative brings together the collective knowledge and wisdom of passionate people to tackle one of the state's most challenging health issues . A five-year $7 .5 million grant from the Partnership Education and Research Committee (PERC) provides the infrastructure for bringing together government entities, communities, researchers, nonprofit organizations and businesses . Grant funding also is used to develop a childhood obesity surveillance system and create statewide messaging that helps residents understand how daily decisions affect their health . Alexandra Adams, MD, PhD, is the principal investigator for the PERC grant and leads a team of faculty and community investigators . She is a professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at the UW School of Medicine and Public Health .In collaboration with health officials and community members in Marathon and Menominee counties, researchers will use a $1 .1 million grant from the Partnership Program's Oversight and Advisory Committee to test and implement a community-based model for childhood obesity prevention . Brian Christens, PhD, associate professor of human ecology at UW-Madison, is the principal investigator for this phase of community work . The model involves developing a \"menu\" of evidence-based strategies and interventions that each community can choose to work toward . Strategies include supporting local food economies and agriculture, promoting public space and recreation, and increasing access to and consumption of healthy food . Each strategy is partnered with three to five specific evidence-based interventions for communities to deploy . \"The Obesity Prevention Initiative works to recognize all those who care about obesity and seeks out their strengths. We are stronger working collectively toward advancing the goals that reflect what is important to our communities.\" - Menominee community member Nearly 30 percent of Wisconsin's adults are obese, according to The State of Obesity 2014 by the Trust for America's Health and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. 1520253035 2013 2012 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 2004 20031520253035 20132012201120102009200820072006200520042003Wisconsin's Adult Obesity Rate Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report 21Lifecourse Initiative Moving Forward The Wisconsin Partnership Program's first major strategic initiative - the Lifecourse Initiative for Healthy Families (LIHF) - continues to broaden the narrative around healthy birth outcomes among African-American families in Wisconsin . In 2014, Deborah Ehrenthal, MD, MPH, joined the UW School of Medicine and Public Health's Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology as the initiative's faculty director . The Lifecourse Initiative works with community collaboratives in Beloit, Kenosha, Milwaukee and Racine, where nearly 90 percent of the state's African-American babies are born . It has supported 22 project grants in these communities, and several are highlighted below: The Bethel AME Church Jobs for Fathers project in Beloit provides pre-employment skills training and has assisted participants with securing and maintaining employment . Serving as an important source of social support, the project also provides an inter-generational community circle for participants to discuss issues affecting men . The African-American Breastfeeding Network project in Milwaukee uses a peer-support model for breastfeeding education and has successfully increased breastfeeding rates among its program participants . The project has garnered national media attention and was featured in an article and video by the Associated Press . 22 Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report The Kenosha Fatherhood Involvement Planning Project is working with the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children to more intentionally address the needs of fathers - a group often overlooked in maternal health programs . Based on focus group research with fathers in Kenosha about their needs, an evidence-based group support program is planned . Wheaton Franciscan All Saints Hospital in Racine is implementing Centering Pregnancy - an evidence-based group prenatal care program . The project is seeing many positive outcomes related to healthy birthweight, increases in breastfeeding and fewer cases of prematurity . On a broader scale, the Lifecourse Initiative continues to collaborate with state and national organizations and programs addressing disparities in infant mortality . Dr . Ehrenthal and many LIHF partners are active members in the Collaborative Improvement & Innovation Network to Reduce Infant Mortality (CoIIN), a national public-private partnership, and serve on statewide work groups focused on safe sleep, preconception care and social determinants of health . In collaborative efforts such as CoIIN, LIHF works closely with the state Department of Health Services and numerous county health departments as a unified voice to achieve greater collective impact . LIHF partners also serve on the Maternal and Child Health Advisory Committee and the new Wisconsin Perinatal Quality Collaborative . Under Dr . Ehrenthal's guidance, the Lifecourse Initiative is refining its evaluation activities to enhance researchers' ability to establish links between the initiative and changes in birth outcomes . The two main goals of the evaluation are to provide information and feedback that guide LIHF and to demonstrate its overall impact . Wisconsin's Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) is a central component of LIHF's evaluation plan . PRAMS, a surveillance system developed by the U .S . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, provides data for planning and assessing health programs and for describing maternal experiences that may contribute to maternal and infant health . In 2014, the Oversight and Advisory Committee renewed funding to oversample African-American mothers for the PRAMS survey in the four LIHF communities . Nationally, PRAMS response rates among African- American women are low . Support from the Partnership Program has resulted in a sustained 15 percent increase in African-American response rates and has enabled the Wisconsin Department of Health Services to work more closely with communities to identify potential strategies for increasing participation in the survey . The Partnership Program also renewed funding for LIHF's Regional Program Office, housed at the Center for Urban Population Health in Milwaukee . This office provides technical assistance and training for the LIHF collaboratives in Beloit, Kenosha, Milwaukee and Racine . In 2014, support focused on community-scan completion, priority-setting, sustainability-planning and coalition-building . The Lifecourse Initiative for Healthy Families has supported 22 project grants that focus on improving prenatal care, increasing family and community supports, and strengthening father involvement in Beloit, Milwaukee, Kenosha and Racine. Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report 23Financial Overview The Wisconsin Partnership Program's assets and endowment value grew modestly during 2014 . Total program assets increased $3 .8 million, and investment returns exceeded distributions by $2 .2 million . The endowment distribution for program expenditures was $15 million in 2014 . Administrative Expenses Administrative expenses include costs incurred by the Partnership Program in seeking and reviewing applications, monitoring and evaluating awards, and supporting other key components of compliance and infrastructure to maintain its grant-making activities . They do not include UW Foundation expenses, which are reported as a reduction of income and described in the Revenues narrative of the Income Statement on page 25 . Partnership Program administrative expenses were $1,068,966 and $945,794 for the years ending December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2014, respectively . The UW School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) also provides in-kind support for Partnership Program administrative expenses from the Office of the Dean; Senior Associate Dean for Basic Science, Biotechnology and Graduate Studies; Senior Associate Dean for Finance; and Associate Dean for Public Health . UW-Madison's Department of Human Resources and Office of Legal Services also provide in-kind support .The Partnership Program's Oversight and Advisory Committee (OAC) and Partnership Education and Research Committee (PERC) approve annually the administrative budget . Allocation of costs in the Income Statement (Table 3) is based on a 35 percent OAC/65 percent PERC split . Detailed expenditures for the period are as follows: Table 1: Administrative Expenses For the Years Ended December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013 2014 2013 Total Salaries $556,835 $650,430 Total Fringe outlined in the Decision of the Commissioner of Insurance in the Matter of the Application for Conversion of Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wisconsin, Partnership Program funds may not be used to supplant funds or resources available from other sources . The SMPH has designed a review process for determination of nonsupplanting, which was approved by the Wisconsin United for Health Foundation, Inc . Annual Report Based on the nonsupplanting determination made by the Senior Associate Dean for Finance, the Dean of the School of Medicine and Public Health has attested to compliance with the supplanting prohibition in this Annual Report . The UW-Madison Vice Chancellor for Finance and Administration also has attested that UW-Madison and the UW System have complied with the supplanting prohibition . OAC Review and Assessment of the Allocated Percentage of Funds As outlined in its founding documents, the OAC annually reviews and assesses the allocation percentage for public health initiatives and for education and research initiatives . The OAC took up the matter on August 20, 2014 . It was moved to retain the allocation of 35 percent for public health initiatives and 65 percent for education and research initiatives . The motion passed unanimously . 24 Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report Change in Investment Allocation The Partnership Program has historically maintained funds that have been distributed from the endowment and available for expenditure in the UW Foundation expendables portfolio as described in the Current Investments section of this report . As of December 31, 2012, the Partnership Program moved $10 million of funds from the expendables portfolio to the endowment portfolio as described in the Noncurrent Investments section of this report . The purpose of this move was to achieve a higher rate of return to allow for increased grant levels . The program made a planned second reinvestment of $10 million in March 2013 . These funds remain fully available to the program and are reflected in Net Assets Temporarily Restricted - Spendable . Accounting The following financial report consolidates activities of the UW Foundation and the SMPH for the years ending December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2014 . Revenues consist of investment income and unrealized changes in market valuation, and expenditures consist of administrative and program costs . All expenses and awards are reported as either public health initiatives (OAC-35 percent) or partnership education and research initiatives (PERC-65 percent) . Approved awards have been fully accrued as a liability less current year expenditures, as shown in Tables 2 and 3 .Table 2: Balance Sheet As of December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013 2014 2013 Assets Current Investments $19,790,637 $17,801,177 Noncurrent Investments $364,303,288 $362,475,704 Total Assets $384,093,925 and Net Assets Liabilities Accounts Payable $0 $0 Grants Payable $37,433,620 $30,980,587 Total Liabilities & Net Assets$384,093,925 $380,276,881Table 3: Income Statement For the years ended December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013 2014 2013 Revenues Gifts Received $0 $0 Investment Income$28,612 in Net Assets$(2,635,991) $33,771,591 Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report 25Financial Notes Cash and Investments The financial resources that support Partnership Program grants as of December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2014, (Table 2) were generated from funds released by the Wisconsin United for Health Foundation, Inc ., as prescribed in the Grant Agreement, as well as generated from investment income . All funds are housed and managed by the UW Foundation . As needed, funds are transferred to the SMPH to reimburse expenses . Income received on spendable funds is based on the performance of the underlying investments . All expenses are charged against spendable funds . Income received on endowment funds is based on the performance of the underlying investments and released in accordance with the UW Foundation's approved spending policy . Current Investments Current investments consist of participation in the UW Foundation expendables portfolio . The objective of the expendables portfolio is to preserve principal and provide a competitive money market yield . Investments have a short-term horizon, usually less than three years, and are mainly short-duration, fixed-income securities . Noncurrent Investments Noncurrent investments consist of participation in the UW Foundation endowment portfolio . The objective of the endowment portfolio is to achieve a long-term return that creates an income stream to fund programs, preserves the real value of the funds and provides for real growth . To achieve this, the endowment is invested in a diversified portfolio that includes global equity, fixed income, real assets, alternative assets and cash equivalents . The UW Foundation uses quantitative models along with qualitative analysis to maximize returns while minimizing risk . The UW Foundation recognizes that individual investments or asset classes within the endowment will be volatile from year to year but believes that this risk will be mitigated through diversification of asset classes and investments within asset classes . Liabilities - Grants Payable Grants payable are recorded as of the date of approval by the Oversight and Advisory Committee or Partnership Education and Research Committee . The liability reflects the total amount of the grant award less any payments made before December 31 of the reporting year . Any subsequent modifications to grant awards are recorded as adjustments of the grant expense in the year the adjustment occurs . Net Assets Based upon the Grant Agreement, net assets are divided into three components: Temporarily Restricted \u2014 Spendable Fund: The portion of net assets relating to funds that have been distributed from the endowment fund, along with related income that is available to the program . These funds are available for the program's grants and administrative expenses . Temporarily Restricted \u2014 Endowment Fund: The portion of net assets relating to realized gains or losses related to the permanently restricted funds that have not been distributed and remain within the endowment portfolio as of December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2014 . Permanently Restricted \u2014 Endowment Fund: The portion of the gift proceeds allocated to permanently endow the Wisconsin Partnership Program . These funds have been invested in the endowment portfolio of the UW Foundation, and the principal is not available to be spent for Partnership Program purposes . Income Statement Revenues Revenues for the years ending December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2014, (Table 3) consist of two components: (1) investment income, which has been recorded as earned throughout the year; and (2) net realized gains/(losses) on investments, which represents the difference between the original cost of investments and the sales proceeds or the fair-market value at the end of the year . Investment revenue amounts are shown after fees have been deducted (net of fees) . The UW 26 Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report Foundation pays management fees to external asset managers and records its revenues net of these fees . In addition, the UW Foundation assesses an expense recapture fee of 1 percent of endowed funds to finance its internal operations (including administration, accounting and development) . The expense recapture fees were $3,103,017 and $3,329,180 in 2013 and 2014, respectively . Partnership Program revenues are shown after these fees have been deducted . Effective January 1, 2012, the UW Foundation modified its policy regarding the investment recapture fee . The Foundation voted to decrease the fee from 1 percent to 0 .7 percent on amounts above $250 million per account . Partnership Program funds exceed the newly established level, and the 2013 and 2014 fee amounts in the preceding paragraph reflect this decrease . The Dean of the School of Medicine and Public Health proposed that the savings from this fee reduction would be fully allocated to the Oversight and Advisory Committee (OAC) for public health initiatives . This proposal was formally accepted by the OAC . In 2013 and 2014, these savings were $258,436 and $355,364, respectively . Investment income distributions to the spendable funds are based on the UW Foundation spending policy applied to the market value of the endowment funds .Expenditures Expenditures for the years ending December 31, 2013, and December 31, 2014, consist of grant awards, as described above, and administrative expenses . All expenses fall under one of the two major components identified in the Partnership Program's 2014-2019 Five-Year Plan: public health initiatives (OAC-35 percent) and partnership education and research initiatives (PERC\u201465 percent) . OAC award amounts are shown in Tables 4 and 5, while PERC award amounts are in Tables 6 and 7 . In any given year, the OAC or PERC may award a greater percentage of awards, but the amount of funds available annually to each committee will remain at 35/65 percent . Over time, awards and actual expenditures will mirror the allocation percentages .Table 4: OAC Awards - Summary 2004-2014 Total Awarded Total Expended Grants Payable 2004 downturn during 2008-2009, the OAC did not approve any awards in 2008 .

Throughout the year, the Partnership Program evaluates the progress and outcomes of funded grants using progress and final reports, financial status reports, presentations and site visits . Training and Technical Assistance To ensure the greatest potential for successful proposals, Partnership Program staff members provide training and technical assistance for grant applicants throughout the year . During 2014, staff developed and facilitated in-person and webcast training for applicants . Staff provided training to faculty members who were invited to submit full applications for the New Investigator and Collaborative Health Sciences programs . Given the significant changes to the full application review process for these programs, the orientations highlighted the role of the new Partnership Education and Research Committee (PERC) Review Subcommittee . The PERC Review Subcommittee includes content experts and community members . The community members, who are new to the review process, assess project relevance and alignment with the Partnership Program's mission, vision and desired outcomes .The Regional Program Office for the Lifecourse Initiative for Healthy Families also provided applicants with personalized technical assistance related to grant-writing, evaluation, community assessments and coalition-building . Review and Monitoring All grant applications undergo a multi-step review by Partnership Program staff members, university faculty and staff, and representatives from state and local agencies and nonprofit organizations . The process includes: Technical review verifying eligibility and compliance with proposal requirements . Expert review consisting of independent assessment and scoring . Full committee review of top-ranked proposals and interview of applicants, as applicable . In addition, grantees receive a team orientation and agree to a Memorandum of Understanding that outlines grant requirements such as progress reports, financial status reports and a final report . Open Meetings and Public Records As directed by the Order of the Commissioner of Insurance approving the conversion of Blue Cross & Blue Shield United of Wisconsin to a stock insurance corporation, the Partnership Program conducts its operations and processes in accordance with the state's Open Meetings and Public Records Laws . Meetings of the Oversight and Advisory Committee (OAC) and the Partnership Education and Research Committee (PERC) and their subcommittees are open to the public and held in accordance with the law . Agendas and minutes are posted on the Partnership Program's website (med .wisc .edu/partnership) and in designated public areas . Diversity Policy The Wisconsin Partnership Program is subject to and complies with the diversity and equal opportunity policies of the UW System Board of Regents and UW-Madison . The OAC and PERC have developed a policy to ensure diversity within the Partnership Program's goals and objectives . The policy emphasizes the importance of a broad perspective and representation for the program's goals, objectives and processes . This commitment to diversity is integral to the Partnership Program's mission to serve the public health needs of Wisconsin and to reduce health disparities through research, education and community partnerships . A broad perspective helps the Partnership Program understand the most effective means to address population health issues and to improve the health of Wisconsin . The policy is available online at med .wisc .edu/partnership . Wisconsin Partnership Program 2014 Annual Report 29Wisconsin Partnership Program Leadership The Oversight and Advisory Committee (OAC) and the Partnership Education and Research Committee (PERC) serve as the Wisconsin Partnership Program's governance committees . Members carefully exercise their fiduciary responsibilities to improve the health of Wisconsin . Oversight and Advisory Committee The University of Wisconsin (UW) System Board of Regents appoints four representatives from the UW School of Medicine and Public Health (SMPH) and four public health advocates to the nine-member Oversight and Advisory Committee (OAC) . The Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance also appoints one OAC member . Members serve four-year terms and may be re-appointed .
