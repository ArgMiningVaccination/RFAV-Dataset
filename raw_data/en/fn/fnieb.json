But the practice of chiropractic today tends to focus entirely on relieving musculoskeletal pain - and that's it. Holistic chiropractic care like the treatment offered at Dr. Lynelle McSweeney's office in Reno, addresses physical pain by also allowing for the proper flow of vital energy in the body. Here's what that really means. SOUND CRAZY? Recognizing that a living body has some kind of spark or life force, which in its absence results in death, makes it easier to understand the importance of a holistic approach to chiropractic. Chiropractic care with a holistic approach, like the kind you'll receive from Dr. McSweeney, focuses not just on the mechanical side of the body, but the quality of the energy moving through the body as well. If you're wondering what this looks like in practice, it's worth a visit to find out. In addition to inquiring about your physical health and symptoms, Dr. McSweeney is likely to ask questions about your relationships to different parts of your life, like your career, family, personal habits, traumas, causes of stress, and more. Her holistic approach to chiropractic care means that in addition to manual adjustments, she's just as likely to make recommendations for nutrition, supplements, and exercises you can try at home. The goal isn't just addressing the symptoms of your physical pain - it's resolving the root of the problem. That takes a well-rounded approach. "}
