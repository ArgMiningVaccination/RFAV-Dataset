Apart from helping to attain longevity AyurVedic practice is often used to help; fatigue, insomnia, arthritis, heart disease, rheumatism, asthma, allergies, digestive problems, mental & cerebral ailments, weight control and joints & muscular aliments. The word AyurVeda is a combination of two Sanskrit words Ayur = Life Veda = Knowledge / Science AyurVeda recognises that our cosmic energy consists of three component energy 'Doshas'; Vata, Pitta and Kapha. Each person has a unique pattern featuring different levels of the three Doshas; one primary and the other two less prominent. Before using AyurVedic remedies it is important to find out your primary or dominant Dosha. Good health relies on our ability to keep the Vata, Pitta and Kapha levels in harmonic balance. The basic principle of Ayurvedic therapy is to prevent and help from illness\u2014rather than respond to indicators of disease\u2014by maintaining balance in and harmony between your body, mind and environment. According to Ayurveda each individual is unique, a combination of physical, mental & emotional characteristics which are known as his/her Prakruti (constitution) Many factors both internal as well as external can affect this constitution. For example, one's emotional state, diet, daily food choices, season and weather, physical trauma, job and family relationships. Once we understand that these factors can cause an imbalance in our constitution we have a choice to take appropriate action to nullify or minimize their effects to eliminate the cause. Within the body there is constant interaction between order and disorder. Once we understand the nature and structure of disorder one can establish order. It is a relationship between humankind and environment. Ayurveda recognizes three primary energies, Vata, Pitta & Kapha. Together they regulate every physiological and psychological characteristic from basic cellular processes to the most complex biological functions. When these forces are in a state of natural balance the defence mechanism of the body works at peak efficiency. Life challenges us with many opportunities. Although there is much over which we have little control, we do have the power to determine our diet and lifestyle. To maintain balance and health it is important to give attention to these decisions. Diet, lifestyle and herbs appropriate to individual constitution strengthen the body, mind and consciousness. When the body's balance gets disturbed, toxins start building up in our body and they result in the form of one of the other disease. In such circumstances the body's own intelligence or immune strength is not capable to flush out these toxins hence a personally tailored combination of healthy Ayurveda die, nutrition, Ayurveda therapies, Ayurveda herbal preparations, yoga, breathing and meditation helps the toxins to be flushed out and to bring balance back. Ayurveda supports the revitalizing and empowering idea that we have the ability to heal ourselves. Once you realize your own potential imbalances, you can take control of your own health and start incorporating Ayurvedic therapies to feel healthier, improve your fitness and become happier and rejuvenated. You can integrate Ayurveda into your wellness routine by seeing an Ayurveda doctor who practices its techniques or by visiting a spa that offers such services. Ayurvedic therapy is tailored to each person's unique constitution (prakriti) and life forces (dosha), so your experience may not be the same as that of a friend. Determining your dosha is a complex process that explores your personal imbalances and takes many things into consideration to help you achieve optimum health. The mission of the practice over a lifetime is to balance all three: Ayurveda has recently become more popular in Western culture. According to Ayurveda each individual is unique and all made up of elements that create health when well-balanced, and illness when imbalanced. This can be on a physical, emotional or spiritual level. It takes into account all of the unique aspects and qualities of each person and helps to relieve symptoms, prevent diseases and helps to reduce illnesses. These elements are the five gross elements of existence (The Pancha Mahabhutas): space, air, fire, water, and earth manifest in each of us in a unique way to give us our physical and mental qualities. These elements then combine into three constitutions, or doshas: Vata, Pitta (Apas) and Earth (Prithvi) exist in everything in the Universe. They uniquely manifest in all life, as well as each of us - to give us our physical and mental qualities. Each person has their own unique combination of these 5 elements that contain 20 different qualities. These elements then go on to further combine and form three distinct physical and energetic Doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Each Dosha behaves very differently and responds to different treatments.
