Among them are abused and neglectedchildren; troubled youth and families; people with low income, andpeople who are mentally ill, developmentally disabled, blind,visually impaired, deaf and hard of hearing. DHS is one of the lar gest agencies in State Government. It comprises about one-quarter of the state's workforce, with more than 20,000 employees. Budget Highlights The Fiscal 2006 Budget for the Department of Human Services totals$5.2 billion, an increase of $362.8 million or 7.4% over the fiscal2005 adjusted appropriation of $4.9 billion. Major increases includethe following: $184.8 million due to increases in costs and caseloads in various Medicaid programs, $55.2 million to support variousprograms for economically disadvantaged families in lieu of federalblock grant funds, $55.0 million to further improve the State's childwelfare system, $38.6 million to provide cash assistance for thedisabled and economically disadvantage singles and childlesscouples, $26.8 million to strengthen the State's mental health system, and $26 million to provide various services to the State'sdevelopmentally disabled population and support for their families. Reforming Child Welfare On June 9, 2004, the State of New Jersey reached final agreementwith the Child Welfare Panel on a comprehensive child welfarereform plan entitled, \"A New Beginning: The Future of ChildWelfare in New Jersey.\" The plan was accepted by the federal judge overseeing the June 2003 settlement of the class action lawsuit filedagainst the state by Children's Rights, Inc. On July 19, 2004, thejudge accepted Enforceable Elements of the New Jersey ChildWelfare Plan as an additional part of the Settlement Agreement. The Child Welfare Reform Plan creates a new \"agency within an agency,\" the Of fice of Children's Services (OCS), to oversee the child welfare system in New Jersey. OCS, led by a Deputy Commissioner, will oversee the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS), thenewly organized Division of Child Behavioral Health Services(formerly the Partnership for Children) and the newly createdDivision of Prevention and Community Partnerships. Also newlycreated under OCS is the New Jersey Child Welfare TrainingAcademy. The Office of Education is shifted to OCS from theDivision of Developmental Disabilities. The Fiscal Y ear 2006 budget will support continuation of the services in the base budgets of DYFS and Child Behavioral Health andimplementation of the comprehensive reforms set forth in the ChildWelfare Re form Plan. Full implementation of the plan is expected to take five years. The plan calls for a complete overhaul of the child welfare system in New Jersey focusing on the safety, permanency and well-being ofchildren that require protective services with a new emphasis on thedevelopment of an array of community services to prevent abuse and neglect from occurring in the first place. The plan sets forth a number of strategies to achieve these goals: - Reduction of caseload size; - DYFS case practice management reforms; - Reorganization of the geographic structure of DYFS offices across the state; - Expansion of child behavioral health services with an emphasis on community access to services and \"right-sizing\" congregate careplacements;- Facilitation of a network of community-based prevention services to provide support and services to families before abuse and neglectoccurs. Community case management will be developed to handlechild welfare issues; - Expansion of substance abuse, domestic violence, and housing programs. The organizational and geographic structure of DYFS service delivery will be reorganized from four regions to 15 OCS AreaOffices which will oversee 46 local DYFS offices. The local DYFS offices will locate caseworkers closer to the communities they serve. Personnel from the Divisions of Child Behavioral Health Servicesand Prevention and Community Partnerships will be co-located inthe OCS Area Offices to facilitate collaboration and cooperationamong these sister divisions. With the Division of Child Behavioral Health Services providing services directly to children and families who need such services, and county community case management eventually taking over childwelfare cases, DYFS will be able to refocus on its core mission ofprotection and permanency for children in cases of abuse and neglect. The new Division of Child Behavioral Health Services (DCBHS, previously known as the Partnership for Children) was created as part of the Office of Children's Services because of the significance ofchild behavioral health services to children and the need to coordinate these services with other systems that serve children. DCBHS isdesigned to make mental and behavioral health services availablealong a single continuum for children involved in the child welfare,mental he alth, and juvenile justice systems. DCBHS brings together the traditional components of child mental health with more recentcommunity-based strategies to form a single system of care forchildren with emotional or behavioral health needs and their families. The Arthur Brisbane Child Treatment Center is currently part of DCBHS and provides psychiatric inpatient treatment, education, and rehabilitation for mentally ill pre-adolescent school age children andadolescents who are legally committed from across the state. TheChild Welfare Reform Plan requires Brisbane to be closed byDecember 2005 and children and adolescents requiring inpatientpsychiatric care to be placed in community-based residentialsettings. The new Division of Prevention and Community Partnerships was created to develop the State's prevention and early interventionsystem into a locally based, user-friendly and culturally competentarray of services and supports. This system is intended to enablefamilies to get the help they need within their own communities. Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services Through the Medicaid, FamilyCare, and Kidcare programs, theDivision of Medical Assistance and Health Services (DMAHS)fulfills its commitment to provide health care to New Jersey's mostvulnerable citizens. The State cost of providing services throughthese programs is projected to increase from $2.0 billion in FY2005to $2.2 billion in FY2006. This increase of 8.4% is attributable tomedical inflation, increased utilization of services, and an increase in the cost of prescription drugs. While the total number of Medicaideligible residents is projected to remain relatively stable at 940,000,the number of children receiving health insurance through theKidCare Program is expected to reach 110,000 by the end of fiscalyear 2006, an increase of 10,000 over current enrollment. The FY06 budget continues support for the Kidcare program with $164 million in State and Federal funds. All New Jersey children with a familyincome up to 350% of the federal poverty level, or $65,975 for afamily of four, will continue to be eligible for coverage under theprogram. To ensure that sufficient resources are available for theHUMAN SERVICES D-166State's children and lowest income adults, the FamilyCare program will continue to support only the 80,000 residents who are currentlyenrolled. In an effort to provide the highest possible level of benefits to the Medicaid population in this challenging fiscal year, the followingoperational efficiencies and client cost-sharing measures saving$25.8 million are recommended: - Savings of $1.5 million will be achieved by switching to electronic information transfer wherever practical in all programs withinDMAHS. This change will reduce the costs incurred for both printing and postage within the Department. The bulk of savings will beobtained through a transition to electronic transmittal of providermanuals and newsletters. - Savings of $1 million will be realized through continued efforts to identify individuals currently enrolled in Medicaid who have duplicate coverage through a commercial company or the Medicare program. - Savings of $20 million will be achieved through the implementation of an enhanced system for the monitoring ofpayments made for outpatient hospital services provided throughMedicaid. This new system will ensure that Medicaid does notoverpay for outpatient hospital services. - Savings of $3.3 million will be achieved by requiring individuals receiving Chiropractic, Home Health, and Physician services to share in the cost of their care. A nominal co-pay of $3 per visit will berequired from adult beneficiaries, excluding pregnant women. Medicaid plans to spend in excess of $1 billion in State and Federal funds on fee-for-service and long term care prescription drugs inFY2006. This does not include those drugs provided through aMedicaid managed care plan or the FamilyCare program. To lessenthe budget pressure created by the rapid increase in the cost andutilization of prescription drugs, the State has implemented the following cost saving measures worth $13.1 million: - In an effort to better control drug utilization and help offset cost increases, adult beneficiaries will begin to share the costs for theirprescriptions in FY2006 for a savings of $4 million to the MedicaidProgram. A nominal $1 co-pay will be required at the point-of-sale for each prescription filled. - Savings of $330,000 will be achieved through changes in payments for injectable drugs dispensed in a physician's office and billed as aphysician service. Currently, Medicaid reimbursement for thesedrugs is based on Average Wholesale Price (AWP) minus 5 percent.This initiative will reduce Medicaid reimbursement to the lower of aphysician's acquisition cost or AWP minus 12.5 percent. Thisproposal will also maximize drug rebate revenue by including drugs administered by physicians in the federal Medicaid Drug RebateProgram. - Savings of $500,000 will be realized through a new claims system edit that will not allow prescriptions for narcotic drugs to be dispensed to anyone taking methadone. The effects of a narcotic prescription are neutralized by methadone, rendering the pharmaceu- tical useless. - Savings of $1 million will be realized through the implementation of a computer system edit that will screen for and deny anyprescription claim that exceeds the maximum allowance for thenumber of pills per prescription. - Savings of $3.4 million will be achieved by reducing the frequency of pricing updates. Currently, prices paid to pharmacies are updatedon a weekly basis, this initiative would change these updates to oncea month. - Savings of $2.8 million will be realized by changing the refill requirements for prescription drugs. Currently, a prescription maybe refilled once it is 75% finished; this initiative would increase that requirement to 85%. - Savings of $1 million will be generated by reducing costs for the function of prior authorizing pharmacy claims. Currently, claimsthat require prior authorization are reviewed by a commercialcontractor; this initiative would shift this function to the State'sSchool of Pharmacy. In addition to traditional fee-for-service medical coverage, 646,000 people, or 69% of all Medicaid Clients, receive health care coveragethrough five Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). Themanaged care program seeks to provide quality access and caremanagement to Medicaid clients, and is funded at $598.5 million inthe FY2006 budget. Community Services The Division of Mental Health Services (DMHS) coordinates andprovides community-based supports, such as counseling, emer gency screening, case management and residential and day programservices. To assist in this goal, a total of $29.4 million is added to the fiscal 2006 community services budget to strengthen the mentalhealth system which includes increases for case management, mental health screening centers, psychiatric services, self-help centers, short term c are facilities, the Community Health Law Project, and the Redirection II Initiative to continue supporting individuals placedand providing services. DHS provides essential services to New Jersey residents with disabilities in order to meet every client's specific needs, servefamilies, and prevent institutionalization. The fiscal 2006 budgetprovides for professional treatment and services in the leastrestrictive and segregated environment possible and promotes thehighest level of functioning for individuals with developmentaldisabilities. The fiscal 2006 budget provides $12.6 million for various Community Services Waiting List (CSWL) and CommunityTransition (CT) initiatives, which place developmentally disabledindividuals from the 7 state developmental centers and the division's waiting list for services in community settings, such as group homes and supervised apartments. The Real Life Choices program enhances the lives of New Jersey's growing developmentally disabled population and defers the need for a community placement for as long as possible by serving the needsof the developmentally disabled living at home with their familieswho await placement from the CSWL or CT initiatives. Features ofthis new program include the following: an increase incommunity-based services including respite and day programming; an increase in federal Medicaid funding for these services under the State's federal Community Care Waiver; and an increase of consumer contributions. Funding of $1.5 million is recommended for theannualized costs of clients that were added in fiscal 2005. The fiscal 2006 budget also includes $2.5 million to enhance services and reduce populations at W oodbridge Developmental Center. These improvements include new medical/adaptive equipment, additionaltraining for physicians, community work programs, courtmonitoring, development of community placements, and nursingrecruitment. Each year the Division of Developmental Disabilities (DDD) has approximately 200 requests for immediate, emergency residentialplacements. These requests include people whose caregivers,usually elderly parents, are no longer able to provide care because of their own medical problems. The total costs provided for theseplacements, including annualized costs, in fiscal 2006 is $7 million. The Division of Disability Services provides personal care assistance to serve New Jersey Medicaid beneficiaries who are experiencingsome functional impairment and need an assistant to help them withHUMAN SERVICES D-167some aspects of daily living such as dressing or bathing. The Personal Care program will grow by $10.6 million to ensure thecontinuation of services to the neediest home-based individuals.Services are authorized prior to implementation to provide care to as many individuals as possible. Supporting Economically Disadvantaged Individuals and FamiliesThe Division of Family Development (DFD) administers the state'swelfare program, Work First New Jersey, and of fers public assistance to the poor and the homeless, as well as providing leadership andsupport to public agencies responsible for administering programsfor New Jersey's needy individuals and families. In this budget year, DFD continues to support the efforts of people who are leaving welfare for work or struggling economically bycontinuing to provide the following services: child care subsidies,child support enforcement, emer gency housing assistance, payments to kinship caregivers, work readiness activities, mental healthassessments, and transportation subsidies. For fiscal year 2006, $1.6 million has been included to assist General Assistance recipients, whose benefits are fully State funded, inbecoming eligible for Supplemental Security Income benefits, which are funded through a mix of State and federal funds. Recognizingincreasing welfare caseloads, the budget increases funding for cashassistance for economically disadvantaged singles and childlesscouples by more than $30 million, funding for cash assistance foreconomically disadvantaged families by more than $20 million, and funding for cash grants for the disabled by more than $2 million. DFD's budget also provides more than $350 million in combined State and federal funds to provide child care services for more than75,000 economically disadvantaged children, including over $100million for providing child care services before and after school andin the summer to approximately 30,000 children in Abbott schooldistricts. Institutional Care The State maintains six psychiatric facilities to serve voluntarilyadmitted or legally committed persons with mental illness. Thisincludes The Arthur Brisbane Child Treatment Center, a facility forpre-adolescent school age children and adolescents who have beenlegally committed. A settlement with Childrens Rights, Inc. and the Child Welfare Reform Plan, which is part of this settlement, requires that this facility be closed by December 31, 2005. The Statemaintains a forensic center on the grounds of Trenton PsychiatricHospital. State Aid to counties provides funds for 90% of themaintenance costs of patients in six county psychiatric hospitals; infiscal 2006, the amount of State Aid provided to these facilities willgrow by $11.1 million, to a total of $104.6 million. The State alsomaintains seven developmental centers, which provide residential,habilitation, and educational services for the developmentallydisabled. To further improve quality and oversight of departmental services, the Department's Office of Program Integrity and Accountabilitycontinues the process of centralizing incident reporting and continues to centralize, streamline and standardize licensing and inspectionfunctions that have historically operated in separate divisionsindependent of each other. Plans to design and build a new, smaller hospital on the grounds of the Park Psychiatric Hospital continue to proceed on track. Thisredesign underscores the commitment to quality of care in ourinstitutions and developmental centers. Addiction Services The Division of Addiction Services provides support to substanceabuse clinics and treatment facilities which reduce drug abuse andtreat and rehabilitate addicts. The division also provides counselingand detoxification services in clinics, institutions and schools, assistsin development of employee assistance programs, coordinates withthe Division of Mental Health Services to provide addiction servicesto the mentally ill, and provides counseling programs for compulsivegamblers.

Department Accomplishments In fiscal 2005, the Department of Human Services made substantialprogress in carrying out the initial phases of the Child WelfareReform Plan - the initiative to overhaul the state's system of childprotective and permanency services. The department's Office ofChildren's Services (OCS) was able to reduce the caseload of theDivision of Youth and Family Services by more than 10% (7,000cases), from its high of over 68,000 in July 2004 to just over 61,000in January 2005. As of December 2004, OCS had filled 260 newpositions to reach a record number of 1,967 caseworkers. OCS alsoimplemented a toll free telephone hotline to report child abuse andneglect. The hotline replaced a previous system of more than 30different telephone numbers with one single, statewide telephonenumber. Since the hotline was implemented in June 2004, over19,000 calls a month have been received. The Real Life Choices Program, for families caring for their developmentally disabled children at home, has expanded and is now serving 200 families in 11 counties. This represents an increase of 127 families, or 174.0%, since the program was fully implemented in the latter part of fiscal 2004. An additional 150 people withdevelopmental disabilities have been moved from institutions intocommunity placements. Group home development also continuedwith the placement of an additional 264 people with developmentaldisabilities from the Community Services Waiting List, raising thetotal number of clients placed from 9,384 to 9,648, an increase of2.8%. The Department continued to enroll children in the popular NJ KidCare program enrollment has now reached over 100,000. Sincefiscal 2003, more than 11,000 children have been added to thisprogram, representing an increase of 12%. The Department has also initiated New Jersey Express Enrollment for Children's Health Carecoverage, which has been successfully piloted in 36 schools and 6hospitals in New Jersey and is expected to help increase enrollmentin the NJ KidCare program. The Division of Mental Health Services substantially completed its multi-year Redirection II Initiative, resulting in 491 new community residential spaces for hospital patients appropriate for discharge plus a range of admission-diversion programs for consumers for whomsuch services averted unnecessary hospitalizations. Those diversionservices included crisis residential programs in five counties,expansion of Program for Assertive Community Treatment (PACT)and case management services, expanded services for persons withco-occurring mental illness and substance abuse, and criminaljustice and mental health collaboration programs, among others. Inaddition, architectural design has been completed for the newGreystone Park Psychiatric Hospital and demolition of the oldfacility has begun. Construction is scheduled to be completed infiscal 2007.HUMAN SERVICES D-168DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES SUMMARY OF APPROPRIATIONS BY FUND (thousands of dollars) Year Ending Year Ending June 30, 2004 June 30, 2006 Orig. & Transfers & 2005 (S)Supple- Reapp. &(E)Emer- SUMMARY OF APPROPRIATIONS BY ORGANIZATION (thousands of dollars) Year Ending Year Ending June 30, 2004 June 30, 2006 Orig. & Transfers & 2005 (S)Supple- Reapp. &(E)Emer- mental(R)Recpts. gencies Available Expended Approp.

Responsible for the administration of several Medicaid Waiver Programs including: TraumaticBrain Injury (TBI) which provides full Medicaid benefits pluscase management, structured day programs, personal careassistants, transportation, respite care and night supervision toTBI survivors between 18 and 64; AIDS Community CareAlternatives Program (ACCAP) which provides full Medicaidbenefits plus case management, private-duty nursing, medicalday care, personal care assistant services, certain narcotic anddrug abuse treatments at home and hospice care to people ofany age with AIDS and children up to age 13 who are HIVpositive; Community Resources for People with Disabilities(formerly known as Model Waivers 1, 2 and 3) whichprovides specialized services in addition to full Medicaidbenefits to people who otherwise would be unable to live inthe community and would probably have to move into anursing home or other institution for disabled fragile children under the care and supervision of the Division of Youth andFamily Services (DYFS). Personal Care Assistance (PCA) services are an optional benefit offered to New JerseyMedicaid beneficiaries who are experiencing functionalimpairment. It provides assistance with aspects of daily livingfor people who have either a short-term or long-termdisability. Personal Preference: New Jersey's Cash andCounseling Demonstration Project, a national research anddemonstration project sponsored by the Robert Wood JohnsonFoundation, studies the effects of allowing disabled Medicaidrecipients who are eligible for PCA services to direct theirown care. Through a monthly cash allowance, participantswork with a consultant to develop a cash management plan bywhich they decide the services they need and the individualsand/or agencies they wish to hire to provide the identifiedservices. The program requires greater consumer responsibil-ity but offers participants greater control, flexibility andchoice. NJ Workability offers people with disabilities who areworking, and whose income would otherwise make themineligible for Medicaid, the opportunity to pay a smallpremium and receive full NJ Medicaid coverage. People withdisabilities, between the ages of 16 and 64, can qualify for theprogram with annual gross incomes as high as $45,084.Personal Assistant Services Program (PASP) provides routine,non-medical assistance to people with disabilities who areemployed, involved in community volunteer work orattending school.

PROGRAM CLASSIFICATIONS 04.Education Services The Office of Education provides year-round educational programming for students who areclients of the Department of Human Services or who havebeen referred to the office through arrangements with othergovernmental agencies. These students generally requireintensive educational services and support that are notavailable through public schools. Students include children with severe physical or emotional disabilities, pregnant andparenting teens who have dropped out of school, and youthwho have been referred by the juvenile justice system. 16.Child Protective and Permanency Services These services to children and families include Initial Response/CaseManagement, Family Support, Subsidized Adoptions andSubstitute Care activities. Initial Response/Case Management includes intake services, which are designed to assist clients with identifying serviceneeds and developing service plans to meet those needs.Initial crisis services are provided when family members areat risk of abuse and/or neglect or other emergency situationsrequiring immediate attention. Case management servicesinclude service planning, assistance to clients requiringsupport services and supervision in protective service cases.Initial response and case management activities are performedby a variety of agencies. Initial protective serviceinvestigations and protective services case management forchildren are provided directly by DYFS through 46 localoffices. Child abuse and neglect reports are initially screenedby DYFS through the Statewide Central Registry. Emergencyassistance is also provided to families under DYFSsupervision when necessary to prevent disruption. Family Support includes a wide variety of services designed to assist families in crisis and preserve and strengthen familiesand communities. Family support services are intended toreduce the need for more intensive services and promoteindependence and self-sufficiency. Activities include home-maker, transportation, psychological/therapeutic, day treat-ment, companionship, legal, and health-related services.Family support services are also provided to assist ResourceFamilies. Resource Families include relative caregivers, foster parents and adoptive families. These are families that provide a home to children who cannot live safely with their parents. Adoption subsidies are provided to resource families whohave adopted children categorized as hard-to-place. Substitute Care involves the purchase or provision of care, temporary or permanent, to children whose needs preventthem from remaining in their own homes. Substitute caresettings include: resource homes (foster, adoptive andrelative), independent living placements, and shelter careHUMAN SERVICES D-226placements. Also included in substitute care are shelter programs and services for victims of domestic violence. Three DYFS-operated residential treatment centers provide intensive therapeutic, support and educational services in astructured and self-contained environment for children whoare unable to function in their own homes and communitiesand cannot be served in less restrictive community-basedsettings because of their behavioral health treatment needs. Inaddition, DYFS contracts with various private residentialtreatment centers, group homes and treatment homes thatprovide board, care, support and treatment services to specialpopulations not served under the auspices of the Division ofChild Behavioral Health Services. These special populationsinclude substance abusers, multiple-handicapped (develop-mentally disabled with mental health issues), medicallyfragile, adolescents aging out of the foster care system,physically handicapped, and abused/neglected children. Independent Living is an alternative living arrangement for older adolescents in need of placement away from theirfamilies, but who possess adequate living skills to besomewhat self-sufficient with minimal supervision. Anetwork of both private and county-operated facilities providetemporary shelter care to children and adolescents inemergency situations. 26.Child Behavioral Health Services These services to children and families include Initial Response, CaseManagement and Family Support. Initial Response includesintake services performed by the Contracted SystemsAdministrator, that creates a single point of entry into thebehavioral health system that registers, tracks and coordinatescare for children at any level. Referrals can be made to theSystems Administrator by DYFS through the StatewideCentral Registry (NJ ABUSE telephone hotline) or otherwise, from behavioral health care providers, the Juvenile Justice System or families themselves. Case management services are provided depending on the level of services required by the child. The highest level ofcase management is provided by Care ManagementOrganizations (CMOs): contracted not-for-profit organiza-tions which provide a full range of treatment and support(wrap-around) services to children with the most complexneeds. They work with child-family teams to developindividualized service plans. The main goal of CMOs is tokeep children in their homes, their schools and theircommunities by community and locally available services asmuch as possible. The next level of case management is provided by Youth Case Managers. There are 167 Youth Case Managers who providecase management for moderate risk children who do not needthe intensive care provided by a CMO but require some levelof case management support. Youth case managementservices include assessment, monitoring and coordinatingservices. Youth Case Managers also work with child andfamily teams to develop individualized service plans, andutilize community services so that children can stay at homewhile they are receiving services. Family Support Organizations (FSOs) are family-run, county-based organizations that provide direct family-to-family peer support, education, advocacy and other services tofamily members of children with emotional and behavioralproblems. FSOs provide support to children and families withthe lowest level of services required. FSOs are not casemanagement services per se but provide support andinformation so families are better able to manage their children's cases themselves. The Division also contracts with providers for Mobile Response and Stabilization Services to respond quickly whena child exhibits emotional or behavioral challenges thatthreaten to disrupt current living arrangements. Mobileresponse provides face to face crisis response within one hour of notification with the goal of stabilizing behavior and avoiding family disruption or loss of placement. This systemoperates 7 days per week, 24 hours per day and can offer up toeight weeks of stabilization services to children andcaregivers. When children need more intensive services, treatment will be provided in residential settings including treatment homes,group homes, residential treatment centers and psychiatriccommunity residences. A determination of clinical necessity determines whether children and youth are in need of this level of services. 36.Prevention and Community Partnership Services The Division of Prevention and Community Partnerships wascreated pursuant to the Child Welfare Reform Plan to expandthe role of DHS in the coordination and development ofStatewide prevention and early intervention efforts for childwelfare. The goal of the division is to develop the State's prevention and early intervention system into a network of locally based, user-friendly and culturally competent array ofservices and supports to make it possible for families to getthe help they need in their own communities. The strategies for achieving this goal are to facilitate the development of Child Welfare Planning Councils. Theseplanning councils are intended to be county level planningbodies reflecting the various communities in the countyincluding residents, consumers of social services including youth, local leaders and service providers. The councils will be charged with assessing, understanding and influencing howchild and family welfare needs in the community are beingmet. In addition to facilitating the development of planning councils, the division will assist communities with a higherlevel of needs to develop community collaboratives. Theseorganizations are also intended to be organized and led bycommunity members and will also assess social service needs.
