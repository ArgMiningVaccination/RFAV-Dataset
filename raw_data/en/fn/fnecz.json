They discuss with colleagues their successes and the areas which still need addressing. They record their needs for future professional development and support, noting whether these are individual needs or part of a wider issue. Participants reflect on the outcomes from the pupil progress meetings, reviewing the progress of their class against the age-related curricular targets, particularly those for children in the target groups who need to make accelerated progress to achieve the age-related expectation. Notes for Senior Leadership Team See: 'Setting of whole-school curricular targets' in the 'Leading on learning' section of the professional development materials. Prior to this PDM, the leadership team should identify an aspect of reading, writing and mathematics that needs to be developed as a whole-school target. This section may require additional session(s) in the school to introduce the whole-school curricular targets and to ensure that all staff members fully understand the subject and curricular knowledge required to teach the curricular targets effectively. Setting curricular targets for half-termThe 'setting and getting' of whole-school curricular targets in reading, writing, and mathematics is a tool to improve 'quality-first' teaching to raise standards through the accelerated progress of underachieving children. Remind colleagues that the school has identified, from their analysis of children's work, test papers, and discussions with teachers and children, aspects of literacy and mathematics from the Primary Framework that are more difficult to teach and (or) learn. These have been set as whole-school curricular targets. Remind staff of the main messages. Whole-school curricular targets are set as a context within which to improve quality-first teaching in aspects of literacy and mathematics that are difficult to teach and/or learn. The aim is to raise the expectations of the whole school community in some aspects of the curriculum and then accelerate the progress of underachieving groups towards and beyond the age-related expectations. Curricular targets should be set each half-term and linked explicitly to the development of teaching and learning strategies in classrooms to improve 'quality-first' teaching that is judged as good or better. Curriculum provision should be reviewed to ensure there are appropriate opportunities planned to review, teach, practise and apply the curricular targets within literacy and mathematics units of work and across the whole curriculum, including the use of precision intervention with the target groups. The leadership team should support colleagues to understand fully the subject, and the curricular and pedagogical knowledge, required to ensure that all children achieve the expectations set for them.\u00a9 Crown copyright 2007 00868-2007DWO-EN-063 The National Strategies | Primary PDM: Problem Solving and Investigating 2: Planning and pedagogy: Improving learning and teaching Notes for the presenterThese notes are only for guidance. It is expected that schools will choose from what is suggested and adapt materials to meet their needs. The notes are written to be appropriate for the entire school, including the Early Years Foundation Stage. Aims of this session are to: establish the importance of effective problem solving and investigating in learning and teaching: explore types of problem solving and investigating to prompt previous knowledge, probe understanding, and promote and extend children's thinking; link problem-solving and investigative strategies to the conditions and culture for learning. Introduction, purpose and the key messagesPurposes of problem solving and investigating Problem-solving activities or investigations: are effective (natural) strategies for learning; are active approaches to learning; give children responsibility for their learning. Linking the teaching strategy to progress in literacy and mathematicsProblem solving should permeate all learning objectives and should not be seen as an ancillary activity. Activity: Ask participants, in pairs, to discuss how children learn from problem solving and investigating. What are the benefits of problem solving and investigating? Linking the teaching strategies to the literacy and mathematics units of workAsk participants, with the curricular targets in mind, to consider a lesson from a unit of work or from the teacher's own plans. Ask participants to identify an opportunity for problem solving. Discuss in small groups how they would introduce the problem and the questions they would ask to support learning. They should then discuss how they would use the plenary and the questions they would ask to find out what children understood about solving problems. Review and teachIn the shared time, the teacher may use problem solving and investigative activities to: refer to previous work to assess children's prior knowledge; develop children's speaking and listening skills and their ability to reflect and analyse; promote engagement and involvement in learning by using a range of problem-solving and investigative techniques.00868-2007DWO-EN-06 \u00a9 Crown copyright 20074 The National Strategies | Primary PDM: Problem Solving and Investigating Practise and applyIn independent time, teachers provide short or extended problem-solving or investigative activities to: support children in drawing out patterns, principles and conclusions, and justifying answers or identifying relationships; promote the social context for positive dialogue; support children in developing a wide range of strategies to develop the skills of working systematically, including finding all possibilities; help children to record their thinking in a variety of ways, including diagrammatic representation and simple algebraic notation. Review In the plenary, the teacher may use a problem-solving or investigative activity to: assess the children's understanding of the objectives being taught; prepare children for the next lesson or series of lessons; provide opportunities for the children to communicate their different approaches to the specific problem-solving activities and to address any misconceptions. Activity : Provide a problem-solving activity, for example, 'How many ways can four different books be placed on a bookshelf?' Provide examples of children's work to motivate discussion. Ask participants for feed back and to contribute to extending these activities. For example, using five books, ten books and any number of books. How well do teachers feel they incorporate problem solving into teaching at present? Ask participants to work in pairs or threes to identify two or three problem- solving and investigative activities that they have used recently. Ask the following questions: Have children explored techniques of problem solving and investigating such as finding rules and describing patterns? What types of activities lend themselves to such explorations? What are the necessary strategies that teachers will need to model so that the children may become more effective problem solvers? (Examples may be working systematically or visualising the problem using familiar shapes or patterns.) Introduce Year 3 training materials on problem solving. Introduce the teaching sequence for problem solving: extract the activity and related vocabulary; - try the activity. - Introduce the teaching sequence for investigative work: extract the activity and related vocabulary; -\u00a9 Crown copyright 2007 00868-2007DWO-EN-065 The National Strategies | Primary PDM: Problem Solving and Investigating try the activity. - Activity: Ask participants in year groups to discuss what opportunities there are for placing problem solving and investigations into this half-term's work. Remind participants that throughout the lesson emphasis needs to be placed on effective questioning. Refer to PDM: Questioning for supporting materials. Improving the conditions for learningIt is suggested that schools identify one or two key messages from those outlined below for improving the conditions for learning and developing the school as a professional learning community; link these to the PDM. To improve the conditions for learning in the classroom, the teacher needs to involve the children in their own learning. The following points support this PDM: the topics, presentations and structure of the problems and investigations generate curiosity and interest; children are clear about the purpose of the problem solving or investigation because it has been well explained; children play an active part in the problem solving and investigation by answering questions, contributing points for discussion, and explaining to the identified audience; teachers set expectations to ensure that children's speculative responses are welcomed; children show understanding of the principles of problem solving and investigating in their response; Conditions to support an effective learning environment in the classroom are as follows: children work in a variety of seating arrangements to facilitate teacher-pupil interaction; all adults understand appropriate strategies for problem solving and investigating to support targeted children; adults listen carefully to children's responses and respond constructively to take learning forward; at least one display includes problem solving and (or) investigation. Activity: Ask participants, drawing on the small group discussion, to identify from their classroom practice two aspects of problem solving that are well developed and two aspects that they feel require further development.00868-2007DWO-EN-06 \u00a9 Crown copyright 20076 The National Strategies | Primary PDM: Problem Solving and Investigating 3: Putting it into practice in the school: Developing the professional learning community Ensuring CPD impacts on children's learning 'Adults are the most important resource in any school' (Making Great Progress DCSF, 00443-2007BKT-EN) Effective CPD is, collaborative, contextualised in classrooms, and gives teachers the time and space to refine their practice. Return to the discussion in the 'Review' section of this PDM - ask participants to share with others how they would introduce a specific problem, what questioning they would use to support learning and what by methods they would use to assess the children's understanding. Personal CPD Reviewing children's progressIdentify one or two personal professional development strategies to try. These should include: working with other teachers, collaborative planning, joint observation of children, evaluation of learning to gather information, reflecting on what has worked well and why, feeding back to the whole school. Identify opportunities to review the achievement of the curricular targets by the target group through discussions with children, samples of work, and pupil progress meetings with colleagues. These can be noted on the personal CPD log. \u00a9 Crown copyright 2007 00868-2007DWO-EN-067 The National Strategies | Primary PDM: Problem Solving and Investigating Personal CPD log Focus of PDM: Date of meeting: Class: Targets Reading Writing Mathematics Whole-school curricular target(s): Class and age-related curricular target(s): Names of target group: Focus Outcome(s) Personal Action(s) and comments Raising standards and accelerating progress: Review and progression: Children in the target group make accelerated progress - more children are working at age-related expectations Improving the quality of teaching and learning: Improving the conditions for learning: Planning and pedagogy:Identified teaching strategy explicitly planned for and used to support the achievement of the high-value curricular targets Classroom climate, organisation, and environment support the learning of the high-value curricular targets Developing the learning community: Putting it into practice in the school:Collaborative models of CPD impact on both adult and children's learning Children know where they are, and what they need to do next "}
