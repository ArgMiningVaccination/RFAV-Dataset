The academic meaning of shaman is, \"an individual who acts as a medium in tribal or traditional communities.\" This definition of shaman has been revised and improved over many years and languages as humanity has interpreted the characteristics of shamans. Shamans are highly spiritual men and women who are believed to be visionaries and spiritual intermediaries. They spend their lives in pursuit of connecting with the nature of the universe. Usually, this pursuit of connection comes from a desire to better perceive truth and ultimate reality. This often takes the form of the shaman trying to understand his or her culture's religion, diety, or nature itself. Shamans are considered to be religious/spiritual specialists throughout many cultures in Africa, Asia, South America, and even the West. In addition to being considered spiritual authorities in tribal communities, shamans are also believed to be healers. As part of their training, shamans develop a deep understanding of the human body, medicinal herbs, and practices, as well as psychological insight to aid the people of their region. These practices were sought after throughout history, and are still revered today in underdeveloped and even developing countries. Shamans appear throughout many regions, cultures, and religions in history. Though the word \"shaman\" may not be used to refer to them, the word \"shaman\" can be used to apply to many similar behaviors across religious practices and practitioners. Shaman talents are seen across cultures and religions for having several distinct abilities. While these abilities vary from person to person and culture to culture, a shaman generally develops the following characteristics and abilities. Healing abilities can vary from shaman to shaman, however, some of the different healing abilities shamans are believed to have are: Shamans are also believed to be spiritually in tune with the unseen dimensions and are said to have out-of-body experiences. Out-of-body experiences can manifest in many ways. Shamans typically meditate in order to have these experiences. The purpose of an out-of-body experience is so that a religious specialist can travel into the spiritual realms to communicate with spiritual/supernatural entities, have prophetic encounters, or gain specific information. The last, most common, ability that a shaman trains to obtain is the ability to enter into altered or trance states at will. Shamans can induce these altered states through meditation or hallucinogenic drugs. Altered states are used by shamans to enable: Most shamans use their special skills to serve their community, their country, or the people they care about. Shamans also use their abilities to connect with spiritual beings/nature in order to understand the fundamental truths of existence. Some shamans write about their experiences, philosophies, and visions to help educate the world on the deeper truths they have divined. Some shamans choose to be recluses while others live and function happily in their chosen societies. Shamans are the spiritual leaders and healers of a community. There are several types of shamanism examples. The first two most common examples are: Within these types of shamans, there are differing levels of skill that are ranked as follows: There are also three categories within Buddhism for different kinds of shamans: Throughout history and across cultures, shaman talents have manifested as shamans being spiritual leaders who have helped their communities through healing, guidance, battle, and peace. There are many different cultures where shamans have had significant influence. Old Norse Seiar was practiced until around 1100 CE. It is a pagan tradition that was widespread in the Nordic regions such as Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland. Seiar was chiefly practiced by women, however, there are some records which indicate that this tradition could also be practiced by men. Seiar shamans were known as the medicine-women and medicine-men of the Nordic regions. If a person needed physical, psychological, spiritual, or emotional help, the Seiar shaman was the first place to go. Seiar shamans would often enter altered states to gain spiritual insight into the root of a person's problems so they could better advise or treat the issue. The Inuit People were also known for having shamans among their tribes. Inuit people are also known as Eskimos. They are the people who settled around the arctic regions, such as Alaska or Siberia. Being a spiritual people who ascribed to [animism](https://study.com/learn/lesson/animism-beliefs-practices-thinking.html)--the belief that all things in nature have a spirit or a soul--their shamans were very adept at connecting to the natural world. [Inuits](https://study.com/learn/lesson/inuit-mythology-gods-goddesses.html) were well-known for seeking out the aid of shamans for advice on how to please the spirits or please the gods. The [Yup'ik people](https://study.com/learn/lesson/yupik-peoples-facts-language-culture.html) were indigenous to Alaska. These are the people who were native to the western parts of Alaska, while the Inuits were indigenous to the eastern regions. The Yup'ik had a different language from the Inuits, but there were several similarities between the tribes. One of these similarities was their perchance to seek out shamans for their talents. Shamans who served the Yup'ik religion were unique in that the Yup'iks believed that no one truly died, but that anyone who passed away would be born into a new generation of people. So shamans who served the Yup'iks did not commune with the dead. Yup'ik shamans were broken up into two categories: good shamans, and bad shamans. The good shamans were known for healing people, while the bad shamans were said to put curses on people. Both types of shamans could be in a village or a community, and both were sought out for their services. While Haitian [Voodoo](https://study.com/learn/lesson/voodoo-religions.html) is a religion in and of itself, many of the priests--in addition to their ceremonial titles--are considered to be shamans by some outside of the Haitian culture. They go into trances to diagnose illnesses, they consult with spirits to give people life direction or advice, seek out universal truths, and they even engage in spirit possession rituals. Haitian Voodou is not the same as shamanism, however. Haitian Voodoo has its roots in both West African spirituality and Catholicism, while shamanism is more closely linked to animism. Haitian Voodoo is a Catholic-rooted folk religion that originated in the Caribbean island of Haiti. It mainly comes from African traditions and beliefs brought by slaves during the colonial period. Shamanism, on the other hand, has no direct relation to Catholicism and it can be traced back to ancient animistic traditions of Eurasia and North America. When thinking about historical and modern-day shamanism, it is important to recognize the distinction between shamanism as a behavior/aspect of religion, rather than being a religion itself. Shamanism can be found in many different forms of religion, and while several religions reject the practices of shamanism. There are some crossovers between the behaviors of a shaman and other religious authorities such as: prophecy, healing, miracles, and visions. However, experiencing these phenomena does not necessarily make a religious authority a shaman. Shamans are individuals who act as intermediaries between the human world and the realm of spirits. Shamans perform rituals, conduct ceremonies, and make use of spells to heal, [exorcise](https://study.com/academy/lesson/exorcism-origin-history.html) evil spirits, or influence natural events. Shamanism is criticized for promoting belief in a false, supernatural reality.. The main arguments against shamans and shamanism, in general, is that they do not adhere to scientific methods; they deny material reality, and their beliefs are superstitious. Additionally, religions such as Christianity, Islam, and Judaism reject shamanism as a pagan ritual where the practitioner draws their power from [demons](https://study.com/academy/lesson/demons-overview-types-examples.html), themselves, or hallucinogens. These religions reject this notion as righteous spirituality because they believe 1) shamans are trying to elevate themselves above God, 2) shamans are drawing on dark powers to influence people away from God, 3) shamans are not acting in accordance with the nature of God. Due to the methods shamans employ, their beliefs and practices are rejected by these religions. Christians, Muslims, and Jews believe that their prophets are vessels for God's voice and power, but that prophets cannot perform miracles or gain insight on their own. Aspects of shamanism are present in modern Western and Eastern culture through astrology, psychics, and faith healers. In Western culture, the use of shaman services is significantly reduced due to Christian, [atheist](https://study.com/learn/lesson/atheism-overview-history.html), and scientific influence. However, shamanism is still very prevalent in areas such as South America, Africa, and Asia in both tribes and large communities. Shamans are people who are believed to have supernatural abilities such as communing with spirits, supernatural and natural healing abilities, and using [altered states of consciousness](https://study.com/learn/lesson/altered-state-of-consciousness.html) to perform a variety of services and ceremonial tasks. Shamanism is not a religion in and of itself, but rather a role that a highly spiritual person takes on as an aspect of their culture. Shamans are admired for seeking the deeper truths of the universe and use their specialized abilities to serve their cultures and communities. Shamans develop these abilities through meditation and training, but this training does not often include the memorization of religious texts. Shamans can be found in many historical cultures. These include the Nordic Seiar, the Inuit people, and the Yap'ik people. In the modern-day, shamans are very well sought out in regions such as South America, Hati, Asia, and Africa. While the priests/monks may not be known as shamans, many of their works mirror the major characteristics of shamans. Nordic Seiar are shamans from the Nordic regions who served the people of their regions by providing healing services. The Yap'ik and Inuit peoples are from the regions of Greenland, Siberia, Northern Canada, and Alaska; these peoples believe in animism, where all things in nature have a soul. Haitian Voodou is a religion that is often compared to (or confused with) shamanism because it priests are believed to experience or induce spirit possession through rituals.

These include, but are not limited to: entering altered states, inducing out-of-body experiences, performing healing rituals, and giving deep spiritual insight. A shaman's role is to serve their culture or community. They usually do this through healing, spiritual insight, or bringing peace between people and the spiritual realm. However, there are some sects of shamanism that specialize in warrior capacities. Shamans are said to continue practicing prolifically in specific regions of Africa, Asia, and South America. Their services are also available in the West, but they are less sought after due to scientific and religious criticisms. Already a member?
