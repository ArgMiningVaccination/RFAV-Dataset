Arnold1and Krushnamegh Kunte2,* Genetic exchange between divergent evolutionary lineages, from introgressive hybridization between locally adapted populations to insertion of retroviral sequences into eukaryotic genomes, has now been documented. The detection of frequent divergence-with-gene- flow contrasts the neo-Darwinian paradigm of largely allopatric diversi cation. Nevertheless, of even greater signi cance is the growing wealth of data suggesting that the recipients of the transferred genomic material gain adaptive phenotypes from the donor lineages. This adaptive enrichment is reflected by changes in pathogenicity in viruses and bacteria, the transformation of ecological amplitude in eukaryotes, and adap- tive radiations in extremely diverse lineages. Although genetic exchange may produce maladaptive consequences, most of the recently reported examples suggest increases in tness, and many such adaptive trait transfers have been identi ed in our own species. Genetic Exchange Affects Adaptive Evolution: It Is Time to Move On When Edgar Anderson stated 'The more imperceptible introgression becomes, the greater its biological signi cance ', and 'thewidedispersalofintrogressive genes (perceptibleonly tothemost exquisitely precise techniques) would be a phenomenon of fundamental importance ' [1], he was not only predicting the evolutionary signi cance of genetic exchange but also the type of method- ologies that would be needed to demonstrate this signi cance. Anderson and colleagues such as Ledyard Stebbins predicted a signi cant contribution of introgressive hybridization [2] to adaptive evolution and biodiversi cation. In the past decade this prediction has been amply validated with extensivegenomicdatasetsanddiverseadaptationsinallknownmicrobialandmetazoanlineages[3-5].Thelong-controversial 'divergence-with-gene- flow'[6]hasalsobeendemonstratedinmany organisms. Furthermore, genetic exchange between all manner of organisms, reflecting an abundance of avenues such as sexual reproduction, parasitism, viral reassortment, and trans- duction is now known to have contributed to the evolution of genomes, adaptations, and entire organismic clades [7]. Thus, the eld of evolutionary biology can now move past the question of whether or not evolutionary lineages can originate and diverge whileundergoing genetic exchange with closely or distantly related organisms. Instead, we should consider the questions (i) how does genetic exchange affect tness in recipient population(s) [7], and (ii) what roles do the genetic architectures of adaptation, linkage, and selection play in the short- and long-term evolutionary dynamics of introgressed genetic and phenotypic elements (Box 1)? This shift in focus requires a muchmoredynamicandcomplexmodelofevolutionarychange,onethatincludesacentralrolefor 'standing genetic variation ' arising from admixture between divergent lineages [8].Trends Although the exchange of genetic material between lineages as diverse as viruses and mammals has been recognized for decades, particularly through the analysis of genomic data- sets, it has remained an active debate as to whether such exchanges can lead to adaptive evolution. Recently, the growing wealth of exam- ples of genetic transfer involving organisms from all domains of life has provided the means to test the hypothesis of adaptive genetic exchange. The repeated testing of this hypothesis has revealed not only adaptive effects among viral and pro- karyotic lineages but also for plants, animals, and fungi. Indeed, the data now available indicate how profoundly important ancient and more recent gene exchange has been in the evolu- tion of even humans. Adaptive evolutionary diversi cation can now be seen as being often facili- tated by the addition of standing genetic variation from one divergent lineage to another. 1Department of Genetics, University of Georgia, Athens, GA 30602, USA 2National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Gandhi Krishi Vignan (K.

All rights reserved.We summarize below our current understanding of adaptive genetic exchange with a selection of prominent recent examples. Although Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material online provide a wide array of studies reporting consequences from genetic exchange, because of limited space we have essentially provided only a fraction of the examples of adaptive evolution involving prokaryotic, viral, and eukaryote-to-eukaryote horizontal genetic transfers. We will consider some of these examples in detail to illustrate (i) the diversity of phenotypic changes, (ii) the similarity of the effects detected, (iii) the inference that genetic exchange not only contrib- utes to increased tness but may also result in maladaptation, and (iv) the types of future studies that will clarify the role of genetic exchange in adaptive evolutionary processes. Genomic Admixture and Reticulate Evolution Are Rampant The Adaptive Genesis of Influenza Pandemics Notwithstanding their mechanism of transmission, genomic constitution (i.e., 'DNA ' or 'RNA ' viruses), and the degree to which mortality accompanies infection, the majority of viral patho- gens of humans are good examples of reticulate evolution. A novel methodology for inferring evolutionary history revealed that whereas dengue and West Nile virus isolates show limited and no indication of genetic exchange, respectively, HIV, influenza, and hepatitis C were marked by extensive reticulation [9]. Such genetic exchange is directly involved in the ability of pathogens to adapt to the immune systems of hosts. An excellent example is the ability of influenza viral pathogens of humans to evolve rapidly and thus ' . . . evade immunity and reinfect previously infected individuals ' [10]. The rapidity of this viral evolution within and across 'flu seasons ' reflects the origin of new mutations within genes and the subsequent production of novel combinations of the genes through viral reassortment [11]. Figure 1 illustrates the role of repeated bouts of reassortment between divergent influenza genomes in the derivation of a highly virulent form. The transition from an influenza virus with low pathogenicity in avian hosts to a virulent human pathogen with 30% host mortality was also accompanied by resistance toBox 1. Recombination, Selection, and the Success and Persistence of Adaptive Introgressions It may be argued that the success of introgressed adaptive traits (including genes and alleles) and the persistence of maladaptive traits depend on the speci c trait, ecological parameters, and the strength of selection. Although this may be true (Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental information online), in evolutionary terms this boils down to four parameters: (i) the rate of hybridization and/or introgression [56,57] , (ii) the rate of recombination [58,59] , (iii) the nature of genetic dominance [60,61] , and (iv) the strength of selection [58]. A high rate of hybridization and little opportunity for recombination and selection may lead to flooding of the recipient genome with maladaptive traits. By contrast, a low rate of hybridization, coupled with an opportunity for recombination and selection, will lead to subsequent incorporation of adaptive traits while purging maladaptive traits in the recipient populations and genomes (following the mechanism of Kondrashov 's hatchet [62]). An excellent example of both adaptive and non-adaptive outcomes is the Soay sheep [28]. In this case, the adaptive light coat color was introgressed from domesticated varieties recently introduced to the island habitat. At the same time, maladaptive coat patterning associated with lowered survivorship was also introgressed, but its frequency decreased over a few dozen generations. Thus, maladaptive introgression was purged over time while retaining adaptive introgression, aided by recombination and selection. This is not possible if introgression is continuous or frequent, recombination is rare, and selection is relatively weak. If recombination and selection lead to retention of only adaptive introgressed traits, our ability to detect maladaptive introgression will deteriorate with time. At shorter time-intervals, it may appear that maladaptive introgression is rampant while adaptive introgression is rare, as judged from many recent cases of introgression between invasive and native species, or between domesticated and wild species or varieties [53,54,63] . However, over longer time-periods, as a result of recombination and selection (or extinction), only adaptive introgression will remain evident. Indeed, most instances of genetic exchange - whether ancient, recent, or current - show adaptive outcomes, but the maladaptive genetic exchanges are almost exclusively attributable to recent genetic exchange. Thus, a challenge for future studies will be to document the relative proportions, actions, and evolutionary trajectories of adaptive and maladaptive traits introgressed as a result of recent bouts of hybridization, where it is possible to study early stages of introgression, recombination, and selection. This eld is ripe for theoretical development but so far has been poorly explored. The cheap and now widely accessible genomic technologies should make it possible to simultaneously test these ideas in myriad empirical systems. 602 Trends in Ecology & Evolution, August 2017, Vol. 32, No. 8immunization [12]. This adaptive evolutionary transition required two coordinated processes of antigenic evolution [mostly involving the hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein gene] and repeated reassortment, thus unleashing viral evolution that, unfortunately for human hosts, resulted in' . . . novel reassortants with pandemic potential ' [12]. Further examples in Table S1 highlight the fact that genetic exchanges and reticulate evolution are now known to be crucial for adaptations in a broad range of organisms. Moreover, these examples highlight the fact that adaptive genetic exchanges can take place in the absence of sexual reproduction not only in prokaryotes but also via horizontal transfers even in more derived eukaryotes, for example, through infections. Genetic Exchanges Take Complex Forms and Produce Unexpected Adaptive Outcomes CRISPR Loci and Bacterial/Archaeal Immunity Science magazine proclaimed CRISPR genome-editing technology its 2015 'Breakthrough of the Year ' [13]. This pronouncement reflected the promise and ethical dilemma Admixed History of a Virulent Influenza. The progenitor lineage (i.e., 'G570) of the human pathogenic influenza, H7N9, evolved through reassortment events. The horizontal bars within each viral isolate represent the eight influenza genes: PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M, and NS (top to bottom). Red and blue segments derive from G57 and other influenza lineages, respectively. The arrows with broken tails indicate interspeci c (i.e., host) gene transmission. The years of occurrence of the various influenza types involved in the evolution of G57 are indicated along the right side of the gure. The following acronyms are used in the delineation of each viral subtype: BJ, two-digit number following the acronyms for the host and place of origin indicates the year of appearance of the various influenza lineages [12].

Trends in Ecology & Evolution, August 2017, Vol. 32, No. 8 603this molecular tool as evidenced, for example, by the modi cation of DNA from human embryos [14]. Nonetheless, as powerful as CRISPR will likely be for human-mediated genomic modi - cation, its natural setting and function within the cells of bacteria and archaea reflect a pervasive impact for the biosphere as a whole. The role played in nature by the 'CRISPR/Cas systems ' - so named because of the often adjacent locations of CRISPR sequence arrays and cas genes - is the provision of adaptive immunity to bacteria and archaea species against viral infection [15]. When viral DNA invades a bacterial or archaeal cell that contains the CRISPR/Cas system, the following cascade of processes occurs: (i) the viral DNA molecule is fragmented; (ii) a portion of the fragmented DNA is inserted as a 'spacer ' into the CRISPR locus; (iii) the CRISPR locus, with new viral DNA spacer, is transcribed and processed, resulting in mature crRNAs; (iv) the mature crRNAs form a complex with Cas proteins; (v) the crRNA/Cas protein complex is compared with invading viral DNA molecules to identify homology; and (vi) following recognition of complementarity with invading viruses, the infecting DNA is degraded by nucleases produced by cas loci [15]. The mechanism of genetic exchange in this adaptive process is both complex and ironic: com- plexity is reflected by the utilization of gene products and DNA sequences from both the host and pathogen to ght the infection; the irony is that the genome of the viral invader is incorporated into that of the host and then used in return by the hosts to identify and destroy further viral infections [15]. Genetic exchanges may take complex forms not only in host -pathogen dynamics (e.g., [16,17] ) but also in symbiotic relationships (e.g., [18 -20]), and facilitate protection from predators, parasites, and parasitoids (e.g., [21,22] ) (Table S2). They may also produce unexpected adaptive outcomes from niche partitioning (e.g., [23,24] ) to metabolic innovations (e.g., [19,25 selection (e.g., [30 -32]) (Table S2). Thus, genetic exchanges have tremendously impacted on the complexity of evolution and diversi - cation of life on Earth, and they continue to play unexpected roles in natural species interactions and in modern human survival and health. Genetic Exchanges Contribute to Evolutionary Innovations and Adaptive Radiations Horizontal Transfer of Bacterial Tal Genes and the Evolution of Vascular Plants The evolutionary innovations necessary for the origin and radiation of land plants from aquatic progenitors included the ability to transport materials such as nutrients and water over long distances within an organism. A key step in the evolution of vasculature of terrestrial plants was the receipt, via an ancient horizontal gene transfer event, of transaldolase (Tal) genes from Actinobacteria [33]. These genes, which affect the number and distribution of vascular bundles, occur only in terrestrial plants and bacteria [33]. Furthermore, genomic analyses demonstrated that the Tal genes underwent purifying selection following their transfer into terrestrial plants [33]. Taken together, these ndings suggest that the horizontal transfer of bacterial Tal loci into early plants provided key genetic elements leading to the immense diversi cation of land plants. Introgression and the Adaptive Evolution of Flower Color Floral trait evolution within the Mimulus aurantiacus complex provides an excellent illustration of how introgressive hybridization can drive adaptive diversi cation. Two to differences pollinator preferences associ- ated with flower color [34]. Genomic analyses demonstrated that (i) the red- flowered phenotype is caused by cis-regulatory mutations gene, (ii) MaMyb2 haplotypes in red- flowered but otherwise highly divergent subspecies are extremely similar, suggesting a single evolutionary origin of red coloration, and (iii) there was discordance 604 Trends in Ecology & Evolution, August 2017, Vol. 32, No. 8between the taxonomy (i.e., 'subspecies phylogeny ') and the haplotype network recovered from eight subspecies [34] (Figure 2). This is a classic signature of an adaptive phenotype - genotype spreading from a single origin into divergent lineages as a result of introgressive hybridization. Introgression, Beak Shape, and Adaptive Evolution in Darwin 's Finches Although genomic data abundantly reveal adaptive trait transfer in all major organismic clades (Table S1), few studies have tested this inference using cross-generational ecological data. One remarkable exception is the 40 year research endeavor by Peter and Rosemary Grant and their colleagues on Darwin 's nches of the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago and Cocos Island. Aside from testing a wide array of evolutionary and ecological hypotheses, this work has provided arguably the clearest example of genetic exchange-mediated adaptive evolution [35]. The morphological traits most often described in studies of the Darwin 's nch species are beak shape and size [35], which prominently affect tness through foraging efciency [36]. Introgressive hybridization throughout multiple bouts of climatic perturbations has increased foraging-related standing genetic variation and provided the basis for adaptation of beak morphology in Darwin 's nches [36] (Figure 3). The transcription factor gene ALX1 controls craniofacial development and differentiation, and is a key developmental genetic regulator of beak diversity within The Results of Introgressive Hybridization in Transferring Red Flower Color Alleles Between Mimulus Clades. The introgression into M. puniceus is reflected in the discordance between the 'subspecies phylogeny ' (left) and the haplotype network (right), made up of 53 unique MaMyb2 haplotypes from 76 individuals representing eight subspecies. Circles reflect individual haplotypes, with the size being proportional to the observed frequency. The colors of the haplotype circles relate to flower color and indicate either the presence or absence of anthocyanins, in other words red or yellow coloration, respectively. The black circles indicate the number of mutational differences between the haplotypes. The broken lines delineate haplotypes representing each of four major subspecies clades [34].

The adaptive craniofacial features of the nches and the introgression of ALX1 across populations and species suggested that 'Natural selection and introgression affecting this locus have contributed to the diversi cation of beak shapes among Darwin 's nches and hence to their expanded utilization of food resources . . . ' [37]. These three examples (also Table S1b) highlight the fact that genetic exchange involving key genetic elements and eco-morphological innovations can be a frequent driver of adaptive radiations in prominent organismal groups. Genetic Exchange, Mammalian Evolution, and Human Adaptations Endogenous Retroviruses and the Evolution of Mammals Genetic exchange has strongly influenced the evolution and biology of mammals. An important exampleentailstheenvelopeprotein genes,known assyncytins,which perform anessentialrole in placentation and which were acquired from retroviruses early in the radiation of marsupial and eutherian clades [38]. Retroviral insertions conferred other crucial adaptations. Recent genomic and functional analyses have documented effects from retroviral insertions on the regulation of innate immunity in a diverse array of mammals, including humans [16]. These retroviral sequences have been inserted into binding sites with the proin flammatory cytokine interferon- g (IFNG) [16]. Interferon molecules contribute to innate immunity by controlling the transcription of a network of genes [16]. The evolution of IFNG regulation, and thus a key component of innate immunity across mammalian lineages, involved independent infection and cooption of the gammaretrovirus, MER41 [16].

The Evolution of Beak Morphology and Foraging Efciency of Darwin 's Finches Is Mediated Through Climatic Perturbations, Followed by Introgressive Hybridization and Natural Selection. A male medium ground nch (Geospiza fortis ) living on Daphne Major Island, Gal\u00e1pagos, is illustrated below, and the beak morphology of the female is illustrated in the top right corner. The data illustrate the evolution of G. fortis beak size over a 40 year study. The mean values, together with the 95% condence limits, reflect the entire population of G. fortis in each year, and the parallel horizontal lines indicate the 95% condence limits on the mean value from the 1973 population [36]. The beak size fluctuated in response to food availability related to climatic perturbations, through which tness was maintained with the aid of repeated adaptive hybrid introgressions of the transcription factor gene ALX1 . This gene controls beak development and differentiation, influencing diversi cation of beaks among Darwin 's nches and hence their expanded utilization of food resources [37].

Homo sapiens as a Receptacle of Archaic Adaptations Garrigan and Kingan [39] hypothesized, given introgression from now-extinct species of Homo into Homo sapiens , that 'the expanding anatomically modern human population [may have] acquired locally adapted genetic variants from endemic archaic populations. ' Their hypothesis of adaptive trait transfer has now been repeatedly substantiated by whole-genome data from extinct Homo species and population genomics data from H. sapiens [40 -48]. Some of the introgressed regions appear to be associated with maladaptive phenotypes in modern H. sapiens , especially with regard to associations with diseases (e.g., prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes) [47,48] . However, a portion of the allelic variation received by humans from their congeners appears to provide locally adaptive phenotypes, such as innate immunity, response to UV radiation, response to limited oxygen, spermatogenesis, and skin/hair characteristics [40 -48]. An example of adaptive trait introgression into humans from Denisovans involved the response to hypoxic environments in extreme altitudes. Resequencing of the genomic interval containing the hypoxia pathway gene, EPAS1 , in 40 Tibetan and 40 Han Chinese individuals, as well as comparison of genomic variation at this locus in global samples of humans, revealed positive selection providing adaptations to high altitudes in Tibetan populations [46]. Signi cantly, the pattern of variation at this locus indicated that the novel genomic characteristics resulted from the introgression of EPAS1 alleles from the Denisovan lineage into humans [46]. As predicted by Garrigan and Kingan [39], the signature of strong, positive selection for the alleles in Tibetan populations suggested 'that admixture with other hominin species . . . provided genetic variation that helped humans to adapt to new environments ' [46]. The introgressed Denisovan 'core haplotype ' that provides Tibetans with adaptations to hypoxic environments also occurs in humans living above 2000 m in the Himalaya, but is absent in lowland populations [49].My 100 75 50 Age of Cooption of the Endogenized MER41 into Various Mammalian Genomes [16]. These retroviral sequences were incorporated through multiple, independent infections in the binding sites associated with proin flammatory cytokine interferon- g (IFNG) [16], which have conferred innate immunity to their mammalian recipients. This is a surprising example of how incorporation of genes from an originally foreign entity in what are normally antagonistic associations could increase the tness of the recipient genomes. Redrawn from [16]. Trends in Ecology & Evolution, August 2017, Vol. 32, No. 8 607Have Genetic Exchanges Sometimes Been Maladaptive? A Historical Perspective A common assumption emerged during the Modern Synthesis (ca 1930 -1950) that genetic exchange, in the form of natural hybridization, was almost always maladaptive. This assumption was as much a philosophical as a scienti c stance, reflecting the viewpoint of 'species ' as sacrosanct units that kept their 'purity ' or genetic integrity by avoiding reproduction with other divergent forms [7]. Notwithstanding the non-scienti c essence of this assumption, one may characterize some genetic exchanges as potentially contributing to reduced tness. To underscore this point, Table S1 includes examples of maladaptive consequences for individu- als, populations, and species. Speci cally, although extensive horizontal transfer of mitochon- drial sequences among species from the Saccharomycetaceae has been detected, signatures of selective constraints suggest the removal of deleterious, chimeric haplotypes [50]. In humans and koalas, the from infectious retroviruses has catastrophic conse- quences on their immune systems, thus leading to vastly reduced tness in affected individuals [51,52] . Introgression from archaic species of Homo into modern humans may also have resulted in maladaptation for humans, as shown by the presence of some archaic alleles that are associated with disease risk [47,48] . It is possible to nd many more examples of maladaptive introgression in contemporary populations of animals and plants, and this has special relevance with respect to invasive species, genetic assimilation, and survival or persis- tence of native biodiversity [7,53 -55]. Thus, the traditional assumption that hybridization leads to maladaptive introgression has some merit. However, the ample evidence for adaptive genetic exchanges presented so far (also Table S1) argues for carefully assessing short- versus long-term evolutionary dynamics of introgression of adaptive and maladaptive geno- types and phenotypes (Box 1). Separating Milk from Water: Adaptive or Maladaptive Introgression? While we believe that the 'maladaptive ' genetic exchanges listed in Table S1 indeed reflect the introgression of maladaptive genetic variations, we must point out the likelihood that some of these variations may actually be 'post-reproductive age ' effects, for example retrovirus inser- tions in humans and koalas [51,52] . Furthermore, current deleterious effects from introduced alleles may mask an earlier or cycling adaptive role. For example, the contribution of some introgressed alleles from archaic Homo to diseases in H. sapiens [47,48] may well reflect the radical lifestyle changes in modern humans (e.g., diet) rather than continuous maladaptive effects from the time of their introduction. Thus, it is essential to properly assess tness consequences of introgressed phenotypes, considering the natural history of organisms under appropriate ecological conditions, and by taking a longer evolutionary perspective. Adaptive and Maladaptive Introgression in the Soay Sheep The Soay sheep of the St. Kilda archipelago of Scotland suitably illustrates the mixed tness effects of introgressive hybridization, and the importance of studying long-term evolutionary consequences. Though this early sheep breed has been living free for up to 4000 years on islands within this archipelago, and is phenotypically similar to wild species such as the Mou flon (Ovis aries ), it is not reproductively isolated from recent domesticates [28]. The lack of reproductive isolation led to introgressive hybridization when domesticated sheep were recently introduced to the islands. In particular, the adaptive effects from the introgression of alleles from the introduced Dunface breed into the wild Soay sheep that determine either coat color or the patterning of coat color were inferred by combining a 25 year ecological study with data from a population genomics analysis [28]. The comparison of the ecological and genomic data detected the action of both positive and negative selection on the introgressed alleles in the Soay sheep. The selectively favored coat color phenotype (i.e., 'light ') in the Soay sheep resulted from introgression of Dunface alleles TYRP1 that cause a domesticated coat patterning phenotype 608 Trends in Ecology & Evolution, August 2017, Vol. 32, No. 8were associated with lowered survivorship in the Soay sheep, resulting in a decrease over time in the frequency of the domesticated alleles [28]. Overall, this analysis conrmed the expecta- tion that introgression among divergent lineages can give rise to evolutionary novelty, but with a portion of the novelty contributing to a maladaptive phenotype. Concluding Remarks The traditional view that introgressive hybridization is either absent or rare, and usually maladaptive, is incompatible with the overwhelming evidence for adaptive genetic exchange mounted in the past two decades in a multitude of organisms showing variable evolutionary divergence. These ndings, summarized above and in Tables S1 and S2, show that: (i) The mechanisms of genetic exchange are diverse, and they may be independent of sexual reproduction, as demonstrated in a wide array of viruses, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes (Tables S1 and S2). (ii) Genetic exchanges can sometimes lead to phenotypic innovations and evolutionary novel- ties that may affect diversi cation and niche evolution in adaptive radiations (Figures 3 and 4). (iii) Genetic exchanges can take complex forms, which may produce a variety of adaptive and non-adaptive consequences (Tables S1 and S2). (iv) Simultaneous introgression of both adaptive and maladaptive traits is possible, which should lead to conflicting selection pressures on the introgressed alleles at short timescales. This may be resolved at longer timescales as a result of recombination and selective retention of adaptive traits, whether they involve monogenic or polygenic traits, and/or multiple traits (Box 1). The well-known mantra for buying and selling real estate is 'location, location, location '. In that spirit, a chant for the current topic would be 'tness estimates, tness estimates, tness estimates '. Whether through manipulative ecological analyses or population genetic tests of selection on genomic datasets, it is essential to test tness effects in mosaic genomes resulting from a variety of genetic exchanges (see Outstanding Questions). Such analyses should now be seen as testing fundamentally important evolutionary hypotheses about the mode and tempo of adaptive genetic exchanges at variable timescales, and their impact on morphological diversi- cation and species radiations. As more and more data appear that reflect adaptive genetic exchanges, we predict that demonstrations of how viral reassortment, horizontal gene transfer, and introgressive hybridization have influenced standing genetic variation, recombinational potential, and the adaptive landscape itself across the web of life will likewise multiply.

Evolution 47, 1637 -1653Outstanding Questions It is now well established that transfer of genes between divergent lineages can affect tness. However, can such tness perturbations lead to adaptive evolution in every type of organism - or are there limitations on such effects because of the biological attributes of the recipients? For example, is it due to a lack of data testing for lower tness, or are prokaryotic species more likely to have tness increases due to genetic exchange? Although examples of adaptive exchange events have been docu- mented in viruses, prokaryotes, and eukaryotes, what is the proportion of gene transfers that have no effect on tness (i.e., are neutral), reduce the tness, or increase the tness of the recipient? Is the likelihood of a neutral, maladap- tive, or adaptive outcome related in any way to the type of molecular mechanism of exchange (i.e., viral reassociation, horizontal gene transfer, introgressive hybridization)?
