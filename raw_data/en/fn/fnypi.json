Effective opioid stewardship strategies utilize practic e-level interventions to organize and improve the management and coordination of long -term opioid therapy ; involves interdisciplinary team - based approach es to care ; involves establishing policies ; uses evidenc ed-based standards; and involves data to track performance measures. Secondary benefits of opioid stewardship include increasing the capacity of health care providers and systems of care to integrate evidence -based opioid prescribing strategies into practice; and creating a standard of care across the health system. Opioid quality assurance and performance improvement processes are the responsibility of local and regional health system leadership , in concert with health care professionals across the care spectrum, and require s a comprehensive strate gy that builds on advanced planning, engages interdisciplinary care teams , and collaborates to leverage resources. This systems approach requires balancing interventions specific to opioids, such as responsible de -prescribing and access to withdrawal manag ement and medic ation assisted treatments (MAT), paired with broader strategies that include work force development and training programs, enhanced peer support systems and participation in collaborative learning networks , robust surveillance strategies, information sharing, and trauma informed responses. Core Elements of the Opioid Stewardship Program 1.Promote l eadership commitment and organizational culture : dedicating necessary resources to optimize chronic pain and chemical dependency services including providing a consistent workforce development program , supporting establishment of interdisciplinary care teams , dedicating adequate patient appointment time, and promoting prescr iber medical decision -making support . 2.Establish a ccountability and create standardization : establishing shared commitment an d vision from the organization and the interdisciplinary pain team. Prescriber accountability and buy-in is necessary to achieve program outcomes surrounding safe opioid prescribing . Standardized approaches and policies are helpful to create uniformity and responsibility . 3.Establish and support functional interdisciplinary pain team s: supporting teams that consist of representatives from medicine, nursing, pharmacy, physical /occupational therapy (i.e. rehabilitation staff) , behavioral health, social work, laboratory, pain management specialists, and substance abuse disciplines, as available. 4.Create relevant a ction plans : creating annual plans that include program goals, activities, assignments, timelines, outcome measures, implementation strategies, and evaluation components . 5.Track, monitor, and report performance data : regular reporting and analysis surrounding opioid prescribing to clinicians , interdisciplinary pain teams, and health system leadership. 6.Advance clinical knowledge and expertise through w ork force development : educating health system front -line clinicians , leadership, and general staff about opioids, dependence, and addiction.3 Indian Health S ystem Values Surrounding Opioid Stewardship Utilize integrated systems where available Use d ata-driven, science -based interventions Integrate r elationship -based and trauma -responsive care Utilize c ulturally -informed approaches Incorporate p eer-supported systems Utilize h olistic approaches that leverage community resources Ground interventions in community wellness Establish c omprehensive and compassionate care for patients with OUD Leverage all available resources Opioid Stewardship Goals 1.Improve patient safety and reduce risk with chronic opioid therapy 2.Improve professional peer evaluation practices surrounding opioid prescribing through adoption of standardized quality assurance processes and data surveillance 3.Enhance patient experience of care and improve patient outcomes Leadership Commitment and Key Support The work of opioid stewardship program leaders is greatly enhanced by the support of other key groups in health care organizations where they are available. Health System Leadership is essential to ensure adequate resource allocation, on -going provider and health system personnel education, support for interdisciplinary care, support for professional practice evaluation, and support for prescriber decision making and patient care planning. Clinicians and department managers are fully engaged in and supportive of efforts to improve patient assessment, pain management, and the safety of opioid prescribing in health systems . Nursing and Care Managers /Coordinators can assist with care coordination, patient education, risk assessm ents, and patient engagement. Quality Department Personnel can be key partners and provide unique insight into quality of care, risk management, and patient safety. Pharmacists can assist with patient assessment, management, patient treatment planning, and quality assurance activities as req uired by IHS and Federal policy. Behavioral Health Staff can assist with psychosocial assessment, diagnostic clarification, provide behavioral therapy and intervention, conduct motivational interviewing, and assist with negotiated interviews. Others from the interdisciplinary care team membership as listed ab ove. Establish and Support Functio nal Interdisciplinary Pain Teams Key points Management of chronic pain is an interdisciplinary process and include s teams comprised of medicine, nursing, pharmacy, physical /occupational therapy (i.e. rehabilitation staff), behavioral health, social work, laboratory, pain management specialists, and substance abuse disciplines , as available. Every effort should be made to communicate information to all members of the patient's health care team regarding the patient's pain experience. This includes clinical condition, past medical history, and pain management goals clearly documented in the patient record.4 Interdisciplinary Pain Teams should meet regularly to review the care of patients on chronic opioid therapy . Rece nt and upcoming transitions of care should be coordinated with the patient and documented in the patient record that includes patient and family education surrounding discharge care coordination, side effects, changes in activities of daily living, home en vironmental concerns, safe opioid use and storage, and safe disposal of unused opioids. Integrative Pain Management Components : Integrative pain management components should be considered core features in the treatment of all patients on chronic opioid t reatment and should be offered where available. oBalanced pain management based on a biopsychosocial model of care. oIndividualized, patient -centered care which is vital to addressing the opioid crisis. oImproved and safer opioid stewardship through risk assessment based on a patient's medical, social, and family history to ensure safe and appropriate prescribing. oApproached in a multidisciplinary manner that focuses on t he patient's medical condition and co-morbidities . Various aspects of care incl ude: Medications. Employ the benefits of d ifferent classes of medications to treat pain with consideration given to pain source, the specific patient 's medical conditions , and past medical history. Restorative movement therapies. Evaluate available physical and occupational therapy, massage therapy and aqua therapy to restore strength and encourage mobility. Interventional procedures. Utilize d ifferent types of minimally invasive procedures that can be important for both acute and chronic pain managem ent. Examples inclu de dry needling, trigger point injections, etc. Complementary and integrative health. Acupuncture, yoga, tai chi, chiropractic, and meditation support a holistic approach to pain management . Behavioral health/psychological interventions. Coping skills and cognitive behavioral therapy can support patients in their pain journey . Multi -modal approach to acute pain in the surgical, injury, burn and trauma setting if applicable . Perioperative sur gical home and acute pain guidelines to provide a framework for expectations improving the patient experience and outcomes . This may include enhanced care coordination between the primary care prescriber and surgical referral center . oAccess to specialize d care is vital with an expanded workforce of pain specialists and behavioral health clinicians to help guide and support appropriately trained primary care clinicians. oDe-stigma tized treatment . Empathy and a non -judgmental approach is critical to minimiz e barriers and maximize treatment and patient outcomes. oInformed decision making through societal awareness, provider education and training, and patient education are needed to understand choices and promote therapeutic alliances between patients and providers. Create R elevant Facility Action Plans Key points 5 Implement facility policies that support evidenced -based guidelines and reference IHS agency requirements. Avoid implementing too many policies and interventions simultaneously . Always prioritize interventions based on the needs of the health system and community as defined by outcome measures and other tracking and reporting metrics as well as balanced with available resources. Utilize specific interventions that target organizational needs that can be divided into three categories: strengthen program management and operation s; access to care; and quality /safety of care. Define evaluation criteria at inception to measure impact of change and identify additional potential improvement areas. Utilize standard tools to create action plans, track assignments, analyze data, and r eport outcomes. Sample Action Plan \u2014see Appendix A Tracking and Reporting of Opioid Metrics Measurement is critical to identify successes, opportunities for improvement , and to assess th e impact of improvement efforts. For opioid stewardship, measurement may involve evaluation of outcome, process , and balancing measures to monitor impact of change. Implementing an Opioid Prescribing Dashboard Facilities perform periodic assessments of the use of opioids in the management of chronic non -cancer pain in accordance with evidenced based standards and IHS policy. Applicable prescribing metrics may include the following: # Total controlled Substances RXs Dispensed % of Total Prescriptions Dispensed that are Controlled Substances Average Daily Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) per Script Total MME Dispensed Total # Patients Who Used Any Opioids Number of Patients with Total DMME > 50 Number of Patients with Total DMME > 90 Number of Patients with ANY concurrent opioid + benzodiazepine Number Co -Prescribed Naloxone Units Dispensed Professional Peer Evaluation The Interdisciplinary Pain Team/ Medication Safety Committee can assist the Clinical Director wit h the identification of systems -based protocols surrounding chronic pain management as well as the creation and use of a standardized tool to assist with performing an assessment of quality and appropriateness of care. Pain management t reatment planning notes should include p rogress toward pain management goals including functional ability (for example, improved pain, improved or preserved physical function, quality of life, mental and cognitive symptoms, and sleep habits). Quality assurance findings may be referred for peer review , for data collection, or for further analysis. Peer review findings can be incorporated into the Ongoing Professional Peer Evaluation (OPPE) process and reported to the 6 Clinical Director for review, follow -on analysis, and intervention if needed. Benchmarking between prescribers may be considered to identify potential prescriber outliers. See Samples in Appendix B -D Workforce Development & Education Effective opioid stewardship requires on -going review and study of available chronic pain manage ment innovations to address both national and local issues. Information should be shared between care teams, regionally, and nationally if indicated. The IHM Part 3, Chapter 30 includes a statement surrounding controlled substance prescriber training req uirements. There may also be opioid training requirements based upon state licensure. There are many options for providing education on opioid prescribing such as formal and informal didactic presentations ; messaging through posters, flyers and newsletters ; or electronic communication to facility groups. Another useful approach is utilization of tele -health strategies, such as participation in ECHO or warm line platforms, to review de-identified cases with specialty providers to make recommendat ions to patient treatment plans . A variety of web -based educational opportunities are available . Education has been found to be most effective when paired with corresponding interventio ns and measurement of outcomes.

Strategy: Strengthen IHS program management and operations to include a focus on w orkforce development. A fully trained, engaged, and equipped workforce is necessary to improve chronic pain management outcomes and to enhance the patient experience. Core competencies surrounding evidence -based pain and addiction interventions need to be developed at each health system to reduce the risk of adverse events and improve patient outcomes. Links to IHS Strategic Plan 2019 -2023: Goal 1.1; 1.3; 2.1; 3.2 Topic Recommendation Status/Updates Evaluate current practices based upon established , evidence -based standards. A formal evaluation of current clinical practices and potential knowledge gaps should be conducted and planning discussions hosted with key stakeholders. Core Pain Management Competencies (defined at the SU level) : Activity/functional status based pain assessments Assessing patient risks (SOAPP, COMM, etc.) Ordering and interpretation of UDS results Cond ucting patient pain assessments to include distinguishing pain quality and treatment based upon pain type Peer to peer evaluation Advanced Training: Vulnerable populations (elderly, pediatrics, pregnancy, patients with history of Substance Use Disorder , etc.) Enhanced communication techniques in difficult conversations (lexicon, and motivational interviewing)12 Opioid de -escalation strategies Psychosocial pain interventions (central sensitization) and care planning DATA Waiver training encouraged for all opioid prescribers Identify current business acumen and leadership support for opioid stewardship to ensure sustained organizational culture shifts to evidence based models Support prescriber ownership of in terdisciplinary models of opioid stewardship Evaluate local, regional, national access to peer learning collaboratives to improve proficiency with pain management practices. Evaluation and participation in ECHO pain and addiction modules Evaluation and p articipation in available tele -mentoring warm -lines Evaluation and participation in available tele -health support programs Stigma Stigma is a major barrier to treatment, so it is important to provide empathy and a non - judgmental approach to improve treatment and outcomes.

Adapted from Albuquerque Area Opioid Systems Based Protocol Form v 2018.01 Appendix B: SAMPLE System -Based Protocol Chronic Opioid Therapy for Non -Cancer Pain (Outpatient, Adult)14 Opioid Type of therapy for moderate to severe cancer pain. - No clinicall y relevant ceiling effect to analgesia; as dose is raised, analgesic effects increase until analgesia is achieved or dose -limiting side effects supervene. - Meperidine not preferred due to potential effects of toxic metabolites. - Methadone must be used with c aution; only clinicians who are knowledgeable about risks posed should use this drug w/o guidance. Agonist intrinsic efficacy (partial agonists) & drugs that have agonist effects at one opioid receptor and antagonist effects at another (mixed agonist -antagonists). - Most were developed to be less attractive to individuals with the disease of addiction; this characteristic does not rationalize widespread use for cancer pain. - All have a ceiling effect for analgesia. - All have the potential to induce acute abstinence in patients with physical dependency to agonist opioids. - Some (pentazo cine and butorphanol) have a high risk of psychotomimetic side effects. - Buprenorphine is available in a transdermal patch and may be of use in relatively opioid -na\u00efve cancer patients. Pure Antagonists -Alvimopan opioids at mu -receptor sites. - Administered for prevention or reversal of opioid effects. - Alvimopan and methylnaltrexone have been developed specifically to treat opioid -induced bowel dysfunction. Mixed Mechanism Drugs -Tramadol -Tapentadol - Centrally acting analgesics that have agonist actions at the mu -receptor and block reuptake of monoamines. Adapted from UpToDate References: 1.
