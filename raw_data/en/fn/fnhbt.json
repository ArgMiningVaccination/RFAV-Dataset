The purpose of the Guaranty Association is to provide statutorily- determined benefits associated with covered policies and contracts i n the unlikely event that a member insurer is unable to meet its financial obligations and is found by a court of law to be insolvent. When a member insurer is found by a court to be insolvent, the Guaranty Association will assess the other member insurers to satisfy the benefits associated with any outstanding covered claims of persons residing in the District of Columbia. However, the protection provided through the Guaranty Association is subjected to certain statutory limits explained under \"Coverage Li mitations\" section, below. In some cases, the Guaranty Association may facilitate the reassignment of policies or contracts to other licensed insurance companies to keep the coverage in -force, with no change in contractual rights or benefits. Coverage The Guaranty Association, established pursuant to the Life and Health Guaranty Association Act of 1992 (\"Act\"), effective July 22, 1992 (D.C. Law 9 -129; D.C. Official Code\u00a7 31 -5401 et seq.), provides insolvency protection for certain types of insurance polici es and contracts. The insolvency protections provided by the Guaranty Association is generally conditioned on a person being 1) a resident of the District of Columbia and 2) the individual insured or owner under a health insurance, life insurance, or annui ty contract issued by a member insurer, or insured under a group policy insurance contract issued by a member insurer. Beneficiaries, payees, or assignees of District insureds are also covered under the Act, even if they reside in another state. Coverage Limitations The Act also limits the amount the Guaranty Association is obligated to pay. The benefits for which the Guaranty Association may become liable shall be limited to the lesser of: The contractual obligations for which the insurer is liable or f or which the insurer would have been liable if it were not an impaired or insolvent insurer; or With respect to any one life, regardless of the number of policies, contracts, or certificates: o $300,000 in life insurance death benefits for any one life; including net cash surrender or net cash withdrawal values; o $300,000 in the present value of annuity benefits, including net cash surrender or net cash withdrawal values; o $300,000 in the present value of structured settlement annuity benefits, includ ing net cash surrender or net cash withdrawal values; o $300,000 for long -term care insurance benefits; o $300,000 for disability insurance benefits; o $500,000 for basic hospital, medical, and surgical insurance, or major medical insurance benefits; DC-GUARANTY(07 -21) o $100,000 fo r coverage not defined as disability insurance or basic hospital, medical and surgical insurance or major medical insurance or long- term care insurance including any net cash surrender and net cash withdrawal values. In no event is the Guaranty Associatio n liable for more than $300,000 in benefits with respect to any one life ($500,000 in the event of basic hospital, medical and surgical insurance or major medical insurance). Additionally, the Guaranty Association is not obligated to cover more than $5,000 ,000 for multiple non - group policies of life insurance with one owner of regardless of the number of policies owned. Exclusions Examples Policy or contract holders are not protected by the Guaranty Association if: They are eligible for protection under the laws of another state (this may occur when the insolvent insurer was domiciled in a state whose guaranty association law protects insureds that live outside of that state); Their insurer was not authorized to do business in the Distric t of Columbia; or Their policy was issued by a charitable organization, a fraternal benefit society, a mandatory state pooling plan, a mutual assessment company, an insurance exchange, a non -profit hospital or medical service organization, a health mainten ance organization, or a risk retention group. The Guaranty Association also does not cover: Any policy or portion of a policy which is not guaranteed by the insurer or for which the individual has assumed the risk; Any policy of reinsurance (unless an ass umption certificate was issued); Any plan or program of an employer or association that provides life, health, or annuity benefits to its employees or members and is self -funded; Interest rate guarantees which exceed certain statutory limitations; Dividends, experience rating credits or fees for services in connection with policy; Credits given in connection with the administration of a policy by a group contract holder; or Unallocated annuity contacts.

Official Code\u00a7 31 -5416), insurers are required to provide notice to policy and contract holders of the existence of the Guaranty Association and the amounts of coverage provided under the Act.

Commissioner District of Columbia Department of Insurance, Securities and Banking 1050 First Street, N.E., Suite 801 Washington, DC 20002 (T) (202) -727-8000 (F) (202) -354-1085 Elizabeth Hoffman, Executive Director District of Columbia Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association 6210 Guardian Gateway, Suite 195 Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland 21005 (T) 410 -248-0407 (F) 410 -248-0409 DC NSAv1 Your Rights and Protections Against Surprise Medical Bills When you get emergency care or are treated by an outofnetwork provider at an innetwork hospital or ambulatory surgical center, you are protected from balance billing. In these cases, you shouldn't be charged more than your plan's copayments, coinsurance and/or deductible. What is \"balance billing\" (sometimes called \"surprise billing\")? When you see a doctor or other health care provider, you may owe certain outofpocket costs, like a copayment, coinsurance, or deductible . You may have additional costs or have to pay the entire bill if you see a provider or visit a health care facility that isn't in your health plan's network and/or your plan does not cover outofnetwork services. \"Outofnetwork\" means providers and facilities that haven't signed a contract with your health plan to provide services. Outofnetwork providers may be allowed to bill you for the difference between what your plan pays and the full amount charged for a service. This is called \"balance billing .\" This amount is likely more than your innetwork costs for the same service and might not count toward your plan's deductible or annual outofpocket limit. Your health plan coverage may not cover out ofnetwork services when you agree (consent) to receive services from the outofnetwork providers. \"Surprise billing\" is an unexpected balance bill. This can happen when you can't control who is involved in your care\u2014like when you have an emergency or when you schedule a visit at an innetwork facility but are unexpectedly treated by an outofnetwork provider. Surprise medical bills could cost thousands of dollars depending on the procedure or service. Providers and facilities are not balance billing you when they seek to collect cost sharing or another amount that you agreed to pay or are required to pay under your plan for the services that they provided. You're protected from balance billing for: Emergency services If you have an emergency medical condition and get emergency services from an outofnetwork provider or facility, the most they can bill you is your plan's innetwork costsharing amount (such as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles). You can't be balance billed for these emergency services. This includes services you may get after you're in stable condition, unless you give written consent and give up your protections not to be balanced billed for these poststabilization services. Certain services at an innetwork hospital or ambulatory surgical center When you get services from an innetwork hospital or ambulatory surgical center, certain providers there may be outofnetwork. In these cases, the most those providers can bill you is your plan's in network costsharing amount. This applies to emergency medicine, anesthesia, pathology, radiology, laboratory, neonatology, assistant surgeon, hospitalist, or intensivist services, or when an in network provider is not available. These providers can't balance bill you and may not ask you to give up your protections not to be balance billed. If you get other types of services at these innetwork facilities, outofnetwork providers can't balance bill you, unless you give written consent and give up your protections. DC NSAv1 You're never required to give up your protections from balance billing. You also aren't required to get outofnetwork care. You can choose a provider or facility in your plan's network. When balance billing isn't allowed, you also have these protections: You're only responsible for paying your share of the cost (like the copayments, coinsurance, and deductible that you would pay if the provider or facility was innetwork). Your health plan will pay any additional costs to outofnetwork providers and facilities directly. Generally, your health plan must: o Cover emergency services without requiring you to get approval for services in advance (also known as \"prior authorization\"). o Cover emergency services by outofnetwork providers and facilities. o Base what you owe the provider or facility (your costsharing) on what it would pay an innetwork provider or facility and show that amount in your explanation of benefits. o Count any amount you pay for emergency services or nonemergency services provided by certain outofnetwork providers at an innetwork facility toward your innetwork deductible and outofpocket limit.

Each Member in your family should select a Primary Care Plan Physician. If you do not select a Primary Care Plan Physician upon enrollment, we will assign you one near your home. You may select or change your Primary Care Plan Physician at any time by visiting us online at www.kp.org or contacting Member Services Monday through Friday between 7:30 a.m. and 9 p.m. at 1- 800-777-7902 or 711 (TTY).

Getting a Referral Our Plan Physicians offer primary medical, pediatric and OB/GYN care as well as specialty care in areas such as general surgery, orthopedic surgery, dermatology and other medical specialties.

We will notify you when our review is complete. Receiving an Authorized Specialist or Hospital Referral If your Plan Provider decides that you require covered Services from a Specialist, you will receive an authorized referral to a Plan Provider who specializes in the type of care you need. In the event that the covered Services you need are not available from a Plan Provider, w e may refer you to another provider. For more information, see Referrals to Non -Plan Specialists and Non -Physician Specialists below. When you need authorized covered Services at a Plan Hospital, you will be referred to a Plan Hospital.

Additional services not specifically listed in the referral are not authorized and will not be reimbursed unless you have received a preauthorization for those S ervices. Standing Referrals to Specialists If you suffer from a life -threatening, degenerative, chronic or disabling disease or condition that requires Specialty Services, your Primary C are Plan Physician may determine, in consultation with you and a Specialist, that you need continuing care from that Specialist. In such instances, your Primary Care Plan Physician will issue a standing referral to the Specialist. A standing referral shoul d be developed by the specialist, your Primary Care Plan Physician and you, and made in accordance with a written treatment plan consisting of covered Services. The treatment plan may limit the authorized number of Specialist Visit s and/or the period of time in which those Specialist Visit s are authorized. It may also require that the Specialist communicate regularly with your Primary Care Plan Physician regarding your treatment and health status.

You may be asked to pay your Cost Share for these additional diagnostic Services. 3. You receive treatment Services during a diagnostic Visit .

Kaiser Permanente for Individuals and Families/ Kaiser Permanente Child Only Membership Agreement and Evidence of Coverage DC-DP-SEC4 (01-20)HIX 4.1 SECTION 4: Subrogation, Reductions and Coordination of Benefits There may be occasions when we will seek reimbursement of the Health Plan's costs of providing care to you, or your benefits are r educed as the result of the existence other types of health benefit coverage . This section provides information on these types of situations, and what to do when you encounter them. Subrogation and Reductions, Explained Subrogation Overview There may be occasions when we require reimbursement of the Health Plan's costs of providing care to you. This occurs when there is a responsible party for an illness you acquire or injury you receive. This process is called subrogation . For example, if you were i nvolved in a slip- and-fall incident at a store because of a spill, and the store was found liable for associated injuries you receive, they may become responsible for payment of the costs of your care for those associated injuries. For more information, se e When Illness or Injury is Caused by a Third Party in this section. Reductions Overview There may be occasions when your benefits are r educed as the result of the existence other types of health benefit coverage available to you. For example, if there is duplicative coverage for your dependent under a primary health benefit plan purchased by your spouse, the costs of care may be divided between the available health benefit plans. For more information, see the Reductions Under Medicare and TRICARE Benefits and Coordination of Benefits provisions in this section. The above scenarios are a couple of examples of when: 1. We may assert the right to recover the costs of benefits provided to you; or 2. A reduction in benefits may occur. The remainder of this section will provide you with information on what to do when you encounter these situations. When Illness or Injury is Caused by a Third Party If the Health Plan provides coverage under this Agreement when ano ther party is alleged to be responsible to pay for treatment you receive, we have the right to subrogate to recover the costs of related benefits administered to you. To secure our rights, the Health Plan will have a lien on the proceeds of any judgment or settlement you obtain against a third party for covered medical expenses . The proceeds of any judgment or settlement that the Member or the Health Plan obtains shall first be applied to satisfy the Health Plan's lien, regardless of whether the total amoun t of recovery is less than the actual losses and damages you incurred. However, you will not have to pay the Health Plan more than what you received from or on behalf of the third party for medical expenses. Notifying the Health Plan of Claims and/or Legal Action Within thirty (30) days after submitting or filing a claim or legal action against the third party, you must send written notice of the claim or legal action to us at the following address : Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of the Mid-Atlantic States, Inc.

If you change attorneys during the legal process, you are required to inform the Health Plan of your change in representation. The Health Plan's Right to Recover Payments In order for the Health Plan to determine the existence of any rights we may have , and to satisfy those rights, you must complete and send the Health Plan all consents, releases, authorizations, assignments and other documents, including lien forms directing your attorney , the third party and the third party's liability insurer to reimburse the Health Plan directly. You may not take any action that is prejudicial to our rights. If your estate, parent, guardian or conservator asserts a claim against a third party based on y our injury or illness; both your estate, parent /guardian or conservator and any settlement or judgment recovered by the estate, parent /guardian or conservator, shall be subject to the Health Plan's liens and other rights to the same extent as if you had as serted the claim against the third party. The Health Plan may assign its rights to enfo rce its liens and other rights. The Health Plan's recovery shall be limited to the extent that the Health Plan provided benefits or made payments for benefits as a resul t of the occurrence that gave rise to the cause of action. Except for any benefits that would be payable under either Personal Injury Protection coverage; and/or a ny capitation agreement the Health Plan has with a participating provider : 1. If you become ill or injured through the fault of a third party and you collect any money from the third party or their insurance company for medical expenses ; or 2. When you recover for medical expenses in a cause of action, the Health Plan has the option of becomi ng subrogated to all claims, causes of action and other rights you may have against a third party or an insurer, government program or other source of coverage for monetary damages, compensation or indemnification on account of the injury or illness alleg edly caused by the third party: a. The Health Plan will be subrogated for any Service provided by or arranged for as: i. A result of the occurrence that gave rise to the cause of action ; or ii. Of the time it mails or delivers a written notice of its intent to exerc ise this option to you or to your attorney, should you be represented by one, as follows: a) Per the Health Plan's fee schedule for Services provided or arranged by the Medical Group ; or b) Any actual expenses that were made for Services provided by participatin g providers. When applicable, a ny amount returned to the Health Plan will be reduced by a pro rata share of the court costs and legal fees incurred by the Member that are applicable to the portion of the settlement returned to the Health Plan.

Health Plan Not Liable for Illness or Injury to Others Who is eligible for coverage under this Agreement is stated in Section 1: Introduction to Your Kaiser Permanente Health Plan . Neither the Health Plan, Plan Hospitals nor the Medical Group provide benefits or health care Services to others due to your liabilities. If you are responsible for illness or inj ury caused to another person, coverage will not be provided under this Agreement unless they are a covered Dependent. Failure to Notify the Health Plan of Responsible Parties It is a requirement under this Agreement to notify the Health Plan of any thi rd party who is responsible for an action that causes illness or injury to you. Failure to notify the Health Plan of your pursuit of claims against a third party due to their negligence is a violation of this Agreement. If a member dually recovers compensa tion by obtaining benefits from the Health Plan and compensation for the same loss from a responsible third party, the Health Plan reserves the right to directly pursue reimbursement of its expenses from the Member who received the settlement as compensati on. No Member , nor the legal representative they appoint , may take any action that would prejudice or prevent the Health Plan's right to recover the costs associated with providing care to any Member covered under this Agreement. Pursuit of Payment from Responsible Parties The Health Plan may use the services of another company to handle the pursuit of subrogation against a responsible third party. When we use these services, the Health Plan may need to release information th at does not require Member consent, including, but not limited to, your name, medical record number, the date of loss, policy and claim numbers (including those of the insurance carrier for a third party), attorney information and copies of bills. In the e vent that medical records or other protected information that requires your consent to be released is requested from us, we will notify you to obtain your consent. Kaiser Permanente for Individuals and Families/ Kaiser Permanente Child Only Membership Agreement and Evidence of Coverage DC-DP-SEC4 (01-20)HIX 4.4 Reductions Under Medicare and TRICARE Benefits If you are enrolled in Medicare Part A a nd/or Part B, your benefits are reduced by any benefits for which you are enrolled and receive under Medicare; except for Members whose Medicare benefits are secondary by law. TRICARE benefits are secondary by law . Coordination of Benefits Coordin ation of Benefits Overview Coordination of benefits applies when a Member has health care cov erage under more than one (1) health benefit p lan. If you or your eligible dependent has coverage under more than one (1) health benefit plan, then you are responsible to inform the Health Plan that the additional coverage exists. When you have other coverage with another health plan or insurance company, we will coordinate benefits with the other coverage. The Health Plan may need information from you to coordinate your benefits. Any information that we request to help us coordinate your benefit s must be provided to us upon request. Right to Obtain and Release Needed Information When information is needed to apply these coordination of benefits rules , the Health Plan will decide the information it needs, and may get that information from, or give it to, any other organization or person. The Health Plan does not need not tell n or obtain consent f rom any person to do this. Primary and Secondary Plan Determination The health benefit p lan that pays fi rst, which is known as the primary plan, is determined by using National Association of Insurance Commis sioners Order of Benefits Guidelines. The primary plan provides benefits as it would in the abse nce of any other coverage. The p lan that pays benefits second , which is known as the secondary plan, coordinates its benefits with the primary plan , and pays t he difference between what the primary plan paid, or the value of any benefit or Service provided, but not more than 100 percent of the total Allowable Expenses, and not to exceed the maximum liability of the secondary plan . The secondary plan is never lia ble for more expenses than it would cover if it had been p rimary. Coordination of Benefits Rules To coordinate your benefits, the Health Plan has rules. The following rules for the Health Plan are modeled after the rules recommended by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners . You will find the rules under Order of Benefit Determination Rules in this section. The Order of Benefit Determination Rules will be used to determine which p lan is the primary plan . Any other plans will be secondar y plan (s). If the Health Plan is the : 1. Primary Plan , it will provide or pay its benefits without considering the other p lan(s) benefits. 2. A secondary Plan, the benefits or services provided under this Agreement will be coordinated with the primary plan so the total of benefits paid, or the reasonable cash value of the services provided, between the primary plan and the secondary plan (s) do not exceed 100 percent of the total Allowable Expense. Kaiser Permanente for Individuals and Families/ Kaiser Permanente Child Only Membership Agreement and Evidence of Coverage DC-DP-SEC4 (01-20)HIX 4.5 Members with a High Deductible Health Plan with a Health Savings A ccount option: If you have other health care coverage in addition to a High Deductible Health Plan with a Health Savings Account option (as described in Section 1: Introduction to Your Kaiser Permanente Health Plan under the Health Savings Account -Qualifie d Plans provision ), the n you may not be eligible to establish or contribute to a H ealth Savings Account Kaiser Permanente does not provide tax advice. Ask your financial or tax advisor about your eligibility .

Order of Benefit Determination Rules The following rules determine the order in which benefits are paid by primary and secondary health benefit plans. 1. If another p lan does not have a C oordination of Benefits provision, that plan is the primary plan . 2. If another plan has a C oordination of Benefits provision, the first of the following rules t hat apply will determine which p lan is the primary plan: Rules for a Subscriber and Dependents 1. Subject to #2 ( immediately below), a p lan that covers a person as a Subscriber is primary to a p lan that covers the person as a dependent. 2. If the person is a Medicare beneficiary, and, as a result of the provisions of Title XVIII of the Social Security Act and implementing regulations, Medicare is: a. Secondary to the p lan covering the person as a dependent; and b. Primary to the p lan covering the person as other than a dependent : i. Then the order of be nefits is reversed so that the plan covering the person as an employee, member, subscriber, policyholder or retiree is the secondary plan and the other p lan covering the person as a dependent is the primary plan . Rules for a Dependent Child/Parent 1. Dependent child with parents who are n ot separated or divorced : When the Health Plan and another p lan cover the same child as a Dependent of different persons , called \"parents,\" then the plan of the parent w hose birthda y falls earlier in the year is primary to the p lan of the parent whose birthday falls later in the year . If both paren ts have the same birthday, the p lan that covered a parent longer is p rimary . If the aforementioned parental birthday rules do not apply to t he rules provided in the other p lan, then the rules in the other p lan will be used to determine the order of benefits. 2. Dependent child with s eparated or d ivorced parents : If two (2) or more p lans cover a person as a dependent child , and that child's parents are divorced , separated or are not living together, whether or not they have ever been married the following rules apply. If a court decree states that : a. One (1) of the parents is responsible for the dependent child's health care expens es or health care coverage and the p lan of that parent has actual knowledge of those terms, that p lan is primary. If the parent with responsibility has no health care coverage for the dependent child's health care expenses, but that parent's spouse does, t hat pare nt's spouse's p lan is the primary plan. This item shall not apply with respect to any plan year during which benefits are paid or provided before the entity has actual knowledge of the court decree provision; or Kaiser Permanente for Individuals and Families/ Kaiser Permanente Child Only Membership Agreement and Evidence of Coverage DC-DP-SEC4 (01-20)HIX 4.6 b. Both parents are responsible for the dependent child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the provisions of Subparagraph #1 of this provision : Dependent Child with Parents Who Are Not Separated or Divorced , shall determine the order of benefits; or c. If a court decree states that th e parents have joint custody without specifying that one parent has responsibility for the health care expenses or health care coverage of the dependent child, the provisions of Subparagraph #1 of this provision : Dependent Child with Parents Who Are Not Se parated or Divorced, shall determine the order of benefits; or i. If there is no court decree allocating responsibility for the child's health care expenses or health care coverage, the order of benefits for the child are as follows: a) The p lan covering the custodial parent; b) The p lan covering the custodial parent's spouse; c) The p lan covering the non -custodial parent; and then d) The p lan covering the non -custodial parent's spouse. Dependent Child Covered Under the Plans of Non- Parent(s) 1. For a dependent chi ld covered under more than one (1) p lan of individuals who are not the parents of the child, the order of benefits shall be determined, as applicable, under the dependent child provisions above, as if those individuals were parents of the child. Dependent Child Who Has Their Own Coverage 1. For a dependent child who has coverage under either or both parents' p lans and also has his or her own coverage as a dependent under a spouse's p lan, the rule in this provision for Longer or Shorter Length of Coverage applies. 2. In the event the dependent child's coverage under the spouse's plan began on the same date as the dependent child's coverage under either or both parents' p lans, the order of benefits shall be determined by applying the birthday rule in this provision under the Dependent Child with Parents Who Are Not Separated or Divorced . Active/Inactive Employee Coverage 1. A plan that covers a person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired (or that employee's dependent) is primary to a p lan that covers that person as a laid off or retired employee (or a laid off or retired employee's dependent). COBRA or State Continuation Coverage 1. If a person whose coverage is provided pursuant to COBRA or under a right of continuation pursuant to state or other federal law is covered under another plan, the p lan covering the person as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree, or that cover s the person as a dependent of an employee, member, subscriber or retiree, is the primary plan and the Plan covering that same person pursuant to COBRA or under a right of continuation pursuant to state or other federal law is the secondary plan. 2. If the oth er plan does not have this rule, and if, as a result, the p lans do not agree on the order of benefits, this rule is ignored. Longer/Shorter Length of Coverage 1. If none of the above rules determi nes the order of benefits, then the p lan that has covered a Subscriber longer time is primary to the p lan that has covered the Subscriber for a shorter time. Kaiser Permanente for Individuals and Families/ Kaiser Permanente Child Only Membership Agreement and Evidence of Coverage DC-DP-SEC4 (01-20)HIX 4.7 Effect of C oordination of B enefits on the Benefits of this Plan When the Health Plan is the primary Plan, coordination of benefits has no effect on the benefits or services provided under this Agreement. When the Health Plan is a secondary Plan to one or more other p lans, its benefits may be coordinated with the primary plan carrier using the guidelines below. This Coordination of Benefits provision shall in no w ay restrict or impede the rendering of services provided by the Health Plan. At the request of the Member or Parent/Guardian, when applicable, the Health Plan will provide or arrange for covered services and then seek coordination with a primary plan. Coor dination with the Health Plan's Benefits The Health Plan may coordinate benefits payable or recover the reasonable cash value of Services it has provided, when the sum of the benefits that would be payable for : 1. Or the reasonable cash value of, the S ervices provided as Allowable Expenses by the He alth Plan in the absence of this Coordination of Benefits provision; and 2. Allowable Expenses under one (1) or more of the other p rimary plans covering the Member , in the absence of provisions with a purpose like that of this Coordination of Benefits provisi on, whether or not a claim thereon is made; exceeds Allowable Expenses in a Claim Determination Period. In that case, the Health Plan benefits will be coordinated, or the reasonable cash value of any services provided by the Health Plan may be reco vered from the p rimary plan, so that the Health Plan benefits and the be nefits payable under the other P lans do not total mo re than the Allowable Expenses. Facility of Payment If a payment is made or Service provided under another Plan, and it includes an amount that should have been paid for or provided by us, then we may pay that amount to the organization that made that payment. The amount paid will be treated as if it was a benefit paid by the Health Plan. Right of Recovery of Payments Made Under Coordination of Benefits If the amount of payment by the Health Plan i s more than it should have been under this Coordination of Benefits provision, or if we provided services that should have been paid by the primary plan, the n we may recover the excess or the reasonable cash value of the services, as applicable, from the p erson who received payment or for whom payment was made, or from an insurance company or other organization. Military Service For any Services for conditions arising from military service that the law requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide, we will not pay the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Copayments are due at the time you receive a Service. You will be billed for any Deductible, if applicable, and Coinsurance you owe. This summary does not describe benefits.
